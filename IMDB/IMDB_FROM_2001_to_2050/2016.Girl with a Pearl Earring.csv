0,MartinHafer,An artistic triumph.,9,30 December 2012,"While one of the major characters in the film is Jan Vermeer and the film is about one of his most famous paintings, my calling the film an artistic triumph is NOT because of this. No, it's because the people making the film have managed to create an amazing work of art in this film. The colors, the set design, the costumes and the entire look of the film is like a Vermeer painting come to life--especially in the set that is Vermeer's studio. If you are unfamiliar with his work and the historical setting, you might not recognize this--but the filmmakers did a brilliant job in creating the look of the period. It is, simply, a triumph in design and cinematography and I am surprised that the film didn't win an Oscar in any of these artistic categories. It did get nominated, but no more--losing to films like ""Master and Commander"" and one of the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies. These two were wonderful films, but when it comes to Costume Design, Art/Set Decoration and Cinematography, ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" is, to me, more remarkable. As for my personal reaction to the movie, I was so enthralled by the look of the film that I could easily look past any other shortcomings in the movie. It also helped that I have seen several of Vermeer's few extant paintings just over the last few months (in London, Edinburgh and Paris) as well as having seen them in New York and Washington in the not too distant past. They are fresh in my mind and the images in the film bring them back to me. The only other film that manages to convey an artist's work this well is the superb ""Lust for Life"" (that featured actors who were virtual duplicates of Van Gogh's subjects).The story is mostly a work of fiction. Nothing is known about the subject in the famous painting for which the film is named--and the movie is entirely conjecture--what MIGHT have happened leading up to the production of this masterpiece. Now I am not complaining about this--it does make for an interesting sort of story. But I also am always worried that people will mistake it for historical fact--which isn't a surprising concern considering that I used to teach history. So, we don't know whether or not one of Vermeer's kids was a brat or if his wife was irrational or if the subject of his painting was his maid or if Vermeer was a horn-dog who liked to sleep with the subjects in his pictures.When it comes to the acting, it might not be everyone's idea of a wonderful film. The acting is highly subdued--with a very, very narrow range of emotions. Considering that the story would have taken place during a very conservative time and place (17th century Holland) and the story centers on a lowly servant, this is probably reasonable--but still might irritate viewers who want action. So, instead of action, there are lots of knowing glances and nuances...not everyone's cup of tea! And, while the illustrious Colin Firth plays Vermeer, you never really learn much about him nor is Firth given much with which to work. Young Scarlett Johansson, however, is ALWAYS in every part of the film--and she manages to make quite a bit of what she is able to convey given the limited emotional ranges in the film. Overall, it's certainly not a film for everyone but a brilliant film nonetheless.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
1,TheLittleSongbird,Work of art sums up Girl with a Pearl Earring quite nicely...,9,28 October 2011,"Girl with a Pearl Earring seemed like a very interesting film, a great cast, a strong film composer such as Alexandre Desplat and of course a film that uses paintings. Maybe because of the sometimes meditative pacing or the subject matter Girl with a Pearl Earring won't appeal to all. However it did to me, what I saw was a very well made, beautifully scored and directed and well acted film. I am all for visually stunning movies. Stunning isn't enough for me, the whole film right down to the cinematography to the evocative costumes, sets and scenery looks exquisite. And need I mention the wonderful paintings? Add to that strong direction, Desplat's most haunting and most beautifully-used score, a script that doesn't feel at all stilted and a moving story and you have a great film. But I cannot mention the cast, Colin Firth and Tom Wilkinson are splendid as always, and Scarlett Johanssen is at her loveliest. In conclusion, may seem like a cliché, but this film is like the paintings featured, a work of art. 9/10 Bethany Cox",Girl with a Pearl Earring
2,SnoopyStyle,"looks really pretty, takes a long time to get going",7,30 August 2013,"Griet (Scarlett Johansson) is a peasant maid working in the house of painter Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth). She becomes his talented assistant, and the model for one of his most famous works. Also starring such greats actors as Tom Wilkinson and Cillian Murphy.This movie is based on a fictional story derived from the Dutch masterpiece painting called Girl with a Pearl Earring. Like the painting, this is really pretty. The set and the costumes are all beautifully created reminiscent of the paintings. Every chance he gets, director Peter Webber frames the movie as a painting. I see the idea behind the style, but inevitably it restraints the picture from anything more than 2 dimensional portraits.Scarlett's reserved performance siphons most of the passion from this film. It's obvious they're trying to allude to an overall sense of restricted sexuality. But it just takes too long to get the tension going. A quicker faster emotional speed is required for the first half.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
3,Prismark10,The light and shade,7,5 May 2014,"A film about a famous painting by Vermeer, itself has to be framed like a painting. So kudos to the cinematographer and the art director for a gorgeous looking film and Alexandre Desplat brings the right notes with the accompanying music.The film depicts Dutch society at the time for a young peasant girl thrown into a religious yet avantgarde household and never quite knowing her place. Scarlett Johansson really hits her stride as Griet showing vulnerability and beauty as well as a yearning to understand art.Colin Firth on the other hand seems to be saddled with a bad wig and you never get into his Vermeer because he always appears to be solemn or brooding or about to lash out as he lives a life of pecuniary and painting commissions in order to make ends meet.Little is known about the artist Vermeer other than that he had lots of children and debt. The film depicting the painting and the characterisation of Griet is fiction. However the film with its is light, shades and colour is a picture.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
4,claudio_carvalho,"Paintings at an Exhibition, in a Magnificent Contemplative Art Work",9,27 February 2005,"In Delfti, Holland, 1665, the poor seventeen years old Griet (Scarlett Johansson) is hired as a maid in the household of the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth), to maintain her family. The Vermeer family is supported by the powerful and wealthy commissioner Van Ruijven (Tom Wilkinson), and is totally dependent on the inspiration of master Johannes Vermeer to keep their high standard of living as if they were rich. When Griet arrives in the breast of Vermeer's family, she understands the relation of power among the members of the family and Van Ruijven, and meanwhile, a platonic love and attraction develop between Johannes and her, due to her feelings and perspective relative to his work. ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" is a magnificent contemplative art work and a beautiful dramatic romance based on a famous painting, which has this name. It is known that the maid who worked in Vermeer's house was the model and inspiration for such a piece of arts. However, the dramatization, based on an adaptation of Tracy Chevalliers's novel, is a fiction. The reconstitution of Delftt in the Seventeenth Century is amazingly perfect, being based on paintings of that time. Watching this film, the viewer feels as if he or she were seeing paintings at an exhibition, and if he or she pauses the DVD on any scene, will have a magnificent painting on the screen of the TV. The intense performance of the cast and direction are overwhelming, highlighting the spectacular Scarlett Johansson, who is in my opinion, one of the best ""new""actress in the cinema industry. Most of the feelings and sensations of the characters are transmitted through the looks and expressions of the actors and actresses. This movie had three Oscar nominations in 2003 (cinematography, art direction and costume design) and two Golden Globe nominations, and is highly recommended to any viewer who appreciates arts. I am a positive fan of movies, I always try to find the beautiful points or entertainment it can offer, instead of looking for destructive parts, like most of the professional critics do, but ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" has superseded my uppermost expectations. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Moça Com Brinco de Pérola"" (""Young Woman With Pearl Earring')",Girl with a Pearl Earring
5,jboothmillard,Girl with a Pearl Earring,6,27 February 2008,"When I heard about it I thought it was a traditional modern day love story, I had no idea it was a period costume drama, but that didn't make any difference. Based on a work of fiction by Tracy Chevalier, this tells a story of events surrounding the creation of the painting ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" by 17th century Dutch master Johannes Vermeer. It is speculated that the little known girl in the painting is a maid that lived with Vermeer, so the film goes along with that idea. Basically Griet (BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Scarlett Johansson) is a maid in the house of Vermeer (Colin Firth). His wealthy patron and sole means of support, Pieter Van Ruijven (Tom Wilkinson) commissions him to paint Griet so that he can have her before it's finished. She must secretly pose for the painting without Vermeer's wife finding out, avoiding Van Ruijven's grasp, and protecting herself from everyone gossipping. Also starring BAFTA nominated Judy Parfitt as Maria Thins, Cillian Murphy as Pieter, Essie Davis as Catharina Bolnes Vermeer, Joanna Scanlan as Tanneke, Alakina Mann as Cornelia Vermeer, Chris McHallem as Griet's Father, Gabrielle Reidy as Griet's Mother and Anna Popplewell as Maertge. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Art Direction-Set Decoration, Best Cinematography and Best Costume Design, it was nominated the BAFTAs for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for Alexandre Desplat, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Make Up/Hair, Best Production Design, Best Adapted Screenplay and the Carl Foreman Award for the Most Promising Newcomer for Peter Webber (director), and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Original Score.

6,ccthemovieman-1,"Slow But Wow, Is This A Visual Treat!",9,13 January 2006,"I can't imagine a lot of people, especially anyone under 40, sitting through this extremely slow film....but I thought it was excellent. However, I am biased because I love great cinematography and stories about famous painters. Sometimes the cameras stay on subject longer than normal, affording the viewer time to really soak it up. If you can stay awake, this film offers some of the prettiest images I've ever seen on film. Scene after scene looks like a classic painting come to life. Scarlet Johannson says very little but is fascinating to watch. For the first-time viewer, there a tension that builds throughout the film leaving wondering what bad thing is about to happen. The story is not an upbeat one, yet not depressing either.One time, I watched this film very early in the morning, something I rarely do, and with the subtitles on. It wasn't a bad way to watch it - a quiet film in the quiet of the pre-dawn hours . The film offers another demonstration of why doesn't have to shed all their clothes to be erotic. This inspired me to read the book, and I enjoyed that, too.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
7,ma-cortes,Colorful and splendid picture upon the excellent Dutch painter and his model,7,5 July 2005,"The film talks about a gorgeous maid (Scarlette Johansson) who goes to work as a servant at Vermeer's (Colin Firth) home in Delft (Holland) location. His jealous wife (Essie Davis) doesn't like the new worker and the troubles come out . Meanwhile, Scarlett falls in love with a butcher (Cilian Murphy) and secretly in love for Vermeer and is lustfully wished by the Vermeer's merchant (Tom Wilkinson).Johannes Vermeer (1632-1675) was born and lived in Delft , he is considered to be the most important Dutch painter , he was dedicated, almost exclusively, to interior scenes that he paints with enjoyable realism, as well as outdoors from Delft locations . The storyline relies heavily on his stormy marriage and on the continued relationship among protagonists : Colin Firth and Scarlette Johansson . The film plot is plain and simple and it is almost slow-moving because happening limited events and that's why it results to be a little bit boring . Picture is correctly based on real deeds , although there is also fiction , the artistic creation process, the extraordinary paintings, and the family scenario are authentic . Greatest scenes of the movie when imaginatively bring to life several of Vermeer's paintings . Scarlett Johansson is wonderful with her sweet and white countenance .

8,moonspinner55,"Not without flaws, but beautifully presented",7,4 May 2006,"Young woman in Holland circa 1665, innocent and wide-eyed but hard working, leaves home for job as scullery maid to a painter named Vermeer and his family; soon, she becomes the artist's secret assistant and muse, eventually posing for Vermeer's famous title-named portrait. Stunning art direction, lively pacing and an absorbing narrative all make up for a few key performances which seem too modern, and minor instances where the editing isn't as sharp as one might hope. The maid's many entrances and exits are repetitive, but Scarlett Johansson proves to be an intuitive actress who excels in a role with very little dialogue. Quite good overall, and with a finale that smartly leaves the breathless viewer wondering...asking...wanting more. *** from ****",Girl with a Pearl Earring
9,blanche-2,Stunning film,8,22 January 2007,"""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" is a 2003 film based on a novel by Tracy Chevalier which invents the story behind Johannes Vermeer's famous painting of the same name. It stars Scarlett Johansson, Colin Firth, Tom Wilkinson and Judy Parfitt. Johannson plays Griet, a maid who comes to work in Vermeer's (Firth) household and soon becomes fascinated by both the artist and his work. Soon Vermeer is teaching her a few things about art and having her mix paints. Suspected of being the philandering artist's lover, Griet is hated by the family and disapproved of by the rest of the staff. Finally Vermeer has her pose in secret for him, wearing one of his wife's pearl earrings. There is an unspoken, unconsummated love between them, complicated by Vermeer's lustful patron, Pieter Van Ruijven (Wilkinson) who wants Griet for himself.There isn't a lot of dialogue in this film but there are emotions and breathtakingly beautiful scenes, each one recreating a painting of a Dutch master. Emotions and thoughts are conveyed by facial expressions, by body language, and by silences.This is a magnificent film to look at. Scarlett Johansson does a beautiful job as Griet, a humble servant who, although she can't read (as Vermeer's wife points out) has an appreciation for Vermeer's work that his wife can never have. It's a performance stripped of Johansson's usual sexiness but the sensuality remains. Colin Firth makes a romantic and complicated Vermeer, and Wilkinson is excellent as the loathsome Van Ruijven, who has tremendous power over the artist. Judy Parfitt is very effective as Vermeer's insecure wife.A gorgeous film, cinematically nearly perfect; the script perhaps doesn't live up to the glorious cinematography but ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" is a treat just the same.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
10,sunwarrior13,Girl with a Pearl Earring Is A Terrific Film,9,28 September 2012,"Girl with a Pearl Earring is a drama based on the novel of the same name by Tracy Chevalier. The film stars Scarlett Johansson, Colin Firth, Tom Wilkinson, and Cillian Murphy. It is named after a painting of the same name by the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer and uses a bright color scheme as in Vermeer's paintings.The screenplay was adapted by screenwriter Olivia Hetreed and directed by directed by Peter Webber.The story is told from the point of view of Griet, a teen-aged girl who leaves her family's care in the country to become a servant for the Vermeer household in the comparatively bustling, canal-laden burgh of Delft. When she arrives, she finds herself at the low end of the servant totem pole, until she's allowed to clean the painting quarters. There, she catches the eye of the taciturn, reclusive Vermeer, and over a period of time, he begins to craft her portrait. Of course, this does little to further his relationship with his jealous, pregnant wife, Catharina or with his most vocal benefactor, van Ruijven, who often dictates what portraits Vermeer should paint. Meanwhile, Griet navigates a sweet, tentative relationship with a peasant boy her age.The film is an intriguing speculative account of the creation of one of Vermeer's most famous and sensual paintings. Every shot in the film looks like it was taken right out of a painting from Delft, Holland during 1665.Also, it was a rare and elegant movie that was bathed in the kind of soft, delicate light that can build unexpectedly to feelings of both anxiety and bliss.Too bad that it lacked energy when the story was told that is why I did not give it the highest score considering that it was a movie of few words and beautiful pictures, and the story is as understated as the acting especially that of Colin Firth and Scarlett Johansson.But nevertheless,it is a terrific film.",Girl with a Pearl Earring

12,Doylenf,"A work of art...will have highest appeal for the ""art film"" crowd...",8,4 September 2006,"17th Century Holland is the setting for a fictionalized story behind the painting of Johannes Vermeer's famous painting of GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING. As played by COLIN FIRTH, he's not prone to much talk (nor is the servant girl played by SCARLETT JOHANSSON) but their expressive looks convey more than pages of dialog could do. Johansson plays a very submissive servant girl living under the strict rules imposed on the lower class and barely opens her mouth except to say, ""Yes"" or ""No"" on occasion. Nevertheless, it's a richly textured performance and both she and Firth do excellent jobs.Most impressive of all are the color cinematography (which won several well deserved awards) and the impressive background score which also won several honors.The acting is uniformly in high standing by the entire cast--including JUDY PARFITT as the strict matriarch of the household, TOM WILKINSON as the patron who is the sole support of the artist's works and would like to get his hands on the servant girl, and CILLIAN MURPHY as the Dutch butcher boy who offers an escape for the girl if she will marry him.Slow moving but fascinating look at this period in time, authentically recreated and directed with meticulous attention to detail by Peter Webber from Tracy Chevalier's novel.Will no doubt find an appreciative audience from those art crowd patrons who have a hunger for movies that are more than special effects and explosions.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
13,Boba_Fett1138,"Good looking, no doubt but lacking in its drama.",7,21 December 2005,"""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" is a good looking movie but it's not a movie that leaves an huge impression afterward.Main problem with the movie is mainly the story in which rarely ever something actually happens. The movie is nothing more than a slow told story about the painter Vermeer and the house maid Griet. Their 'relationship' is portrayed well in the movie and is build up nicely but the movie lacks real depth and substance. It doesn't particularly make ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" an interesting movie to follow from start till finish. Even though the movie is only about 100 minutes short, it actually feels longer because the story is told slowly and subtle. Some fine looking sequences are the end result that are all beautiful to look at but still feel lacking when it comes down to the story and the emotions of the movie.The sets and cinematography are without doubt what makes this movie still work. It gives a beautiful and fairly detailed look into the 17th century life in Delft. Although it's still odd to see that Delft looks a surprising lot like Venice in this movie. No wonder, when I read the trivia section here, I found out that the sets for Delft used in this movie, were reused Venice sets from another movie.The acting is fair enough. Tom Wilkinson plays a deliciously 'villainish' role, a sort of role in which he always shines. I wasn't really too happy with Colin Firth and Scarlett Johansson. All both of them did during this movie, was looking intense and both looked like they were about to burst out in tears, in all of their sequences. I know this was intentional and needed to tell the story with but to me it became a bit irritating after a while. They hardly ever say more than 1 sentence. It does provide some good sequences and moments and in the scene's with the both of them together it works out just fine but for the whole movie it's simply too much of the same and because of that it also looses its power and interestingness after a while. Yes, this movie is a typical case of style over substance but in this case the style is interesting enough to make this a good and certainly well watchable movie.A good looking and good told story but it lacks real depth and drama, to make the movie really interesting to follow.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Girl with a Pearl Earring

15,ferguson-6,A Museum of Beautiful Shots,7,18 January 2004,"Greetings again from the darkness.  Director Peter Webber and Cinematographer Eduardo Serra have created a visual masterpiece.  At least 15 shots in the movie could be a painting unto themselves.  The colors and use of lighting throughout give us a real feel for the artistry of Johannes Vermeer (played stoically by Colin Firth).  The beauty of the shots combined with the beauty of Scarlett Johansson (""Lost in Translation"") make this a visual treat and provide a glimpse inside the artist and the era.  Screen veteran Tom Wilkinson (""In the Bedroom"") offers up the necessary venom for us to understand Vermeer's total disdain for everything except his craft. Adding to the texture of the film is the terrific score (quite the opposite of most Hollywood movies).

16,gradyharp,When film about Art become Art: An Homage,10,22 May 2012,"GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING was a dazzling novel by Tracy Chevalier, an achievement so stunning that artists, art historians, art lovers and readers all willingly sacrificed historic accuracy for the illuminating insight on how a painting comes into being. Now Peter Webber with the help of his screenwriters has enhanced the novel and made visual all the magic the book contained and more. The story is so well known by now that rehashing the plot seems pointless. This is simply a take on how Vermeer created a mysteriously beautiful portrait of a young girl in his studio, a painting that though small, holds all of the magic of light source, absorption, and reflection that became the hallmark of the great Dutch master painter. Though the story is minimal it is the cinematography/picture composition that is the main feature here. Care is given to the exteriors of Delft (as staged in Luxembourg) to be cold and misty, making the interior shots all the more claustrophobic and intimate and lighted only by candle or by the limited light from leaded glass windows. This is a movie that would be thoroughly understood even if the soundtrack were lost. But that is not giving importance to the actors who people this painting come to life. Colin Firth as Vermeer says little with his lips but says vistas with his eyes: this is a sensitive understated performance. The wearer of the earring is Scarlett Johansson as Griet and she brings to her role a physical beauty of face and presence that make this version of how Vermeer created his 28 masterpieces believable. As a maid in Vermeer's house she is under the scrutiny of Vermeer's ever-pregnant wife (an excellent Essie Davis) and even more controlled by the presence of Vermeer's mother-in-law - the wondrous Judy Parfitt who is so elegant in her Elizabethan type white collar over her black gowns that she begs to be a painting Vermeer never did! Tom Wilkinson adds credence to Vermeer's patron and Cillian Murphy receives all the benefits of Griet's coming into the knowledge of ecstasy as her butcher boyfriend, a lad with penetrating blue eyes and brusque charm. The musical score is most fitting (Alexandre Desplat). This is a treat of the eyes and the mind and sure to become a staple in the libraries of all who love art.

17,siderite,"Visually beautiful, a bit boring, inspired by a book",8,7 August 2007,"I was forced to mark this an 8, even if my heart wasn't really in it. You see, I don't really care about how the light falls and the colors go. But even I have to admit that this was a beautiful film. Inspired by a book, that is itself inspired only by the painting homonym with the film, The Girl with a Pearl Earring describes the Dutch society at the time, all from the eyes of a young peasant girl, played by Scarlet Johansson. Little is actually known about the life of Vermeer other than that he had 11 children and he left them and his wife in debt when he died. The entire story you see in the film is fiction.I was glad to see yet another (the second after Lost in Translation) movie in which Scarlet is actually cute. In all the rest she tries to much to look something artificial that is not beautiful at all. Maybe the script was conducive toward a nice attitude, as well.Well, if you expect anything else than what I described above, you won't get it. The music is fine, the visuals are nice, the acting is good, but the story pretty much describes only the obsessive artistic vision of a painter viewed through the eyes of his maid. Very similar in feeling with the Jeckyl/Hyde adaptation Mary Reilly, without the violent bit.Well done, but didn't really move me. The wife liked it, though.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
18,JamesHitchcock,Close to Perfection,10,13 February 2004,"Possible SpoilersPainters in films (like other creative artists such as writers and musicians) are often portrayed as tortured, emotionally unstable souls, with an intimate connection between their inner torment and their creative gifts. (Kirk Douglas's famous portrayal of Vincent van Gogh in `Lust for Life' is perhaps the best example). This, of course, is a quintessentially Romantic conception of the artist; it is perhaps also the most comforting conception for Everyman, who finds consolation for the fact that he is not himself an artistic genius by the thought that artistic genius must be paid for in emotional suffering.`Girl with a Pearl Earring', however, reverts to an older, pre-Romantic conception of the artist. Artistic creativity is not the record of the sufferings of a tormented soul, but an intellectual process in which great works are born of a marriage between rational thought and supreme craftsmanship. Johannes Vermeer, one of the two main characters in this film, is portrayed as an artist of this type, quiet and thoughtful, whose undoubted imagination and sensitivity are governed by his reason. Although Vermeer is a dedicated artist, however, he is not, in financial terms, a particularly successful one. His working methods are slow and painstaking, and he insists on painting his works entirely by himself at a time when many painters (such as Rubens) made use of large numbers of assistants and apprentices to help them. As a result, Vermeer's output is small and he is over-dependent on a single patron, the wealthy merchant van Ruijven.
Vermeer may not be particularly wealthy himself, but he and his family are still middle-class by the standards of the day, which means that they employ several servants. The other main character in the film is Griet, a teenage girl employed as a maid in the household. Griet starts as simply a kitchen maid, but soon comes to her master's attention and begins to help him in his work. Eventually he asks her to act as a model for what will become one of his most famous paintings, `Girl with a Pearl Earring', but this is the start of Griet's problems as she attracts both the lustful attentions of van Ruijven and the jealousy of Vermeer's wife Catharina.At the heart of the film is the relationship between Vermeer and Griet. Theirs is in a way a love story, although it is not a love based upon sexual desire; Vermeer is faithful to Catharina, and Griet has her own sweetheart, the butcher's son Pieter. It is rather a platonic love based upon their mutual love of art; Griet becomes fascinated with her master's craft, and he recognises in her an aesthetic sensitivity wholly lacking in Catharina, who sees painting simply as a means of putting meat on their table. Griet learns how to mix colours, and Vermeer explains to her the workings of the camera obscura. She shows an instinctive understanding of his work; she queries an instruction from Catharina to clean the windows of his studio, fearing that this might affect the lighting of the room, and even ventures to advise him on the composition of one of his paintings.Vermeer may see Griet as a kindred spirit, but socially she is not his equal, and ultimately he is unable to protect her against the predatory van Ruijven, who sees all working-class girls as fair game, or against the cold, snobbish Catharina. (Catharina's jealousy of Griet arises less from a mistaken suspicion that she is Vermeer's mistress than from a dislike of seeing a servant getting `above herself'). Tom Wilkinson gives a subtle performance as van Ruijven, making him seem at first an affable and generous patron and a man of taste and discernment, then gradually allowing the deeply unpleasant side of his character to show through.
The most important elements of Vermeer's art are quietness, balance, harmony, and his masterful use of lighting effects. The film strives both to demonstrate these qualities and to emulate them. The scenes where Vermeer is at work show the importance of his attention to detail and how something seemingly insignificant can make a great difference; take away the pearl earring from the picture, and it loses much of its subtle harmony. The look of the film itself is also a subtle one; the photography is beautiful but restrained, shot in tones of brown, white, grey and dull yellow. Brighter colours are used sparingly and by way of contrast- particularly the vivid blue of the pigment which we see Vermeer mixing and of the headscarf which Griet wears while being painted. (The strict Protestant sect to which she belongs requires women to cover their heads at all times). The acting is equally restrained- both Colin Firth as Vermeer and the lovely Scarlett Johansson as Griet play their parts to perfection, conveying feeling mainly by looks and gestures. As with the colours, more overt displays of emotion are used sparingly- as with Vermeer's outburst of anger when Griet is falsely suspected of stealing a comb- and again are more effective because of the contrast.I should also mention the haunting music by Alexandre Desplat. Although it is by no means a pastiche of seventeenth century music, it nevertheless seems appropriate to both the mood of the film and the period in which it is set.`Girl with a Pearl Earring' is the nearest to perfection the British cinema has come for many years- a subtle, harmonious exploration of the nature of artistic creativity, the relationship between the sexes and the relationship between different social classes. 10/10.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
19,=G=,The painting was better than the book,8,4 May 2004,"""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" tells a fictional tale about how the title painting by 17th century Dutch painter Vermeer might have come to be. Outwardly, the film is a story about the painter and a household maid who becomes the subject of the painting. Inwardly, the film is about the unspoken but palpable feelings between two people of very different stature and station which may or may not be forever cast in the crazed pigments of the masterpiece. Those who can tap into the subtle human emotional undercurrents will find this film far more satisfying than those who cannot.

This is the case here, and maybe half of the screen time is composed of camera images in the style of Vermeer, very well fit with the period of life, and work of the painter.
Otherwise, it is quite a minor film. I did not read the book, so I cannot say how complex and better the book is, and how much made it to the screen. What I saw is based upon a very linear and too simple story line, which would fit a ten minutes documentary, but does not sustain a 90 minutes length movie. Certainly, Scarlett Johansson is amazing physically, but her talent is yet to be confirmed in some more serious work than 'Girl...' and even than the role she had in 'Lost in Translation'. A great actress cannot sustain herself long term only by her physical beauty, but Scarlett is so young that her career may still take her to real heights. The rest of the cast is not much better than in good British historic TV dramas, and the director Peter Webber, coming exactly from the British TV environment is yet to make a better big screen film.Future cinemateque festivals dedicated to films inspired by works of art will figure this film at a honor place. However, as a film piece of art it is  just a pleasant but minor work. 7/10 on my personal scale.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
21,Irishchatter,A very unpredictable film..,8,5 August 2015,"To be quite honest with you, I found this film a very unpredictable movie because you wouldn't know what the hell happens next really! I have never had seen Scarlett Johansson be so quiet for her role in the film before. She's mostly the person that would be a people involver but I suppose she has to do what she had to do!Tom Wilkinson ' s character I swear to god was honestly quite scary! He's a great actor but got a pretty terrifying role in this film! That near rape scene was horrific!The painting that was known as the Girl with a Pearl Earring really looked familiar as I have seen it before somewhere! It's such a pretty painting whoever the girl was. It's a bit like the Mona Lisa with her smile but like who is she?If you want to watch a Victoria film, see this!",Girl with a Pearl Earring
22,Floated2,Artistic but slow moving,3,28 July 2020,"Having no knowledge of the source material about the novel or the works of its painter's artist with the painting. Little to much of the film brought interest. This is an art film.The visuals are very nicely done and Scarlett Johansson is very capable and magnetic to watch as a young nervous and timid servant maid.Otherwise the film is quite slow moving and dull. Very little dialogue is present with many scenes of long periods of silence. Although once the twist occurs, some decent engagement scenes of drama occur.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
23,Red-125,A masterpiece about a masterpiece!,10,14 February 2004,"Girl with a Pearl Earring (2003), directed by Peter Webber, is amasterpiece about a masterpiece.  Webber has crafted a truework of art from the excellent novel by Tracy Chevalier.  Virtuallyevery scene in this beautiful movie rings true.  The film is set in thepainter Johannes Vermeer's home town of Delft.  This city was,and is, celebrated for its clear, cold, Northern light.  Vermeer hasalways been acknowledged as the finest painter of this light. Making a movie about a master of light is a challenge, and Webbermeets this challenge extraordinarily well.My comments about Scarlett Johansson in my review of ""Lost inTranslation"" were anything but flattering.  However, in this film sheexcels.  Ms Johansson transforms herself into the servant girlGriet, and her ability to look like the young woman portrayed byVermeer in ""The Girl with a Pearl Earing"" is uncanny.This is a must-see movie for anyone interested in art, and in theway art and artists are portrayed on screen.  Don't miss it!Note:  In the novel, the author explains that Griet is forced to workas a servant because her father--a painter of tiles--haspermanently injured his hand.  This is an important fact in thestory--Griet wasn't raised from childhood with the expectation thatshe would become a domestic servant.  Unfortunately,  this pointisn't made clear in the opening frames of the film, so I present ithere.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
24,filipemanuelneto,A film where art and cinema blend.,7,22 November 2016,"Vermeer is one of the most famous names in Flemish painting, and ""Girl with Pearl Earring"" is one of his most famous works. The whole film revolves around this painting and its model, developing a fictional story (based on a novel) in which the painter creates a sentimental connection with the model, without the film itself being clear about the nature of this relationship. We never realize if they are lovers or if they just create a friendship based on common interests. And this deliberate doubt is one of the elements that holds the public until the end of the film, despite being very stopped and having a rhythm that can leave some people bored.The construction of the characters deserves a positive mention. The film allows us to understand the character and personality of almost everyone. Griet, the maid/model, is a poor young woman who needs that job to survive, and for whom beauty can really be a drag. However, this is not the reason why she is shy and withdrawn to the point of keeping her blond hair always hidden. This is a result of time and place: Dutch morality was rather austere and puritanical, thanks to the Protestant mentality. This can also be seen in the contained attitude of Vermeer. He is a discreet and hard-working man, who literally lives on the art and needs it to pay his bills, which sometimes leaves his family's financial situation in some trouble. For him, the support of rich patrons was essential, and the film clearly shows it.The film is also interesting in technical issues, particularly in the scenarios and the way they recreated the time and place. We can, in several moments, see how important art was to build this environment. A lot of details in the scenery are clearly inspired or copied from Flemish paintings. But the art direction goes one step further, by embedding in the film the recreation of a series of famous paintings of this time. For example, there is a moment where the kitchens of the painter's house are shown and, for a brief moment, the image of the painting ""The Milkmaid"" is recreated.This is a worth watching movie.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
25,leonblackwood,Slow paced! 4/10,4,13 September 2014,"Review: Although this movie is about an historical moment, I did find the pace quite slow and boring in parts. The director captured the period very well and I did feel for the servants who had to work extremely hard for there disrespectful masters. Griet, whose played by Scarlett Johannson, didn't do anything wrong as a servant, but she was constantly getting punished because of the attention that she was getting from Johannes Vermeer, played by Colin Firth. When you actually look at the real picture, you can't help but wonder what is going on in this girls mind. This movie does bring some light to the whole world surrounding this one picture, but I would have liked to see more about Vermeer who was a very unique artist. His attention to detail was a long process and the way that he created the colours were an eye opener. Anyway, you do have to be in the right mood to watch the movie because it has a very moody tone, but it is interesting because of it's historical element. Average!Round-Up: After watching a few of Scarlett Johannson's movies back to back, she did seem to act the same in her earlier roles, but she has grown out of that habit of late. With movies like The Avengers and Lucy, she has become a more physical actress who has been blowing up at the box office. She also showed that she can tone down her roles with movies like Under The Skin and Hitchcock which didn't rely on her physical abilities so she has proved that she can take on any project that is put in front of her. Colin Firth is the master of period dramas so this role was right down his street. He is a proud owner of an Oscar after his brilliant performance in The King's Speech so there isn't that much more for him to achieve in such a versatile career. As for the other actors in this movie, they all put in a great performance but I'm just not a big fan of period dramas. Budget: $10million Worldwide Gross: $31.5millionI recommend this movie to people who are into there period dramas about the famous Girl With A Pearl Earring painting and how it came about. 4/10",Girl with a Pearl Earring
26,GOWBTW,Got some educational use to it!,10,12 January 2006,"A great movie about the artist is one thing, when it comes to the mysterious painting about ""The Girl With The Pearl Earring"". This movie sums it up! A peasant girl named Griet(Scarlett Johanssen) who works for the famous painter(Colin Firth) which makes history in the making. Griet is a very wise shopper, I liked the way she tested the quality of the pork. Back in the day, everything was bought right away, no proper refrigeration, no way to preserve the food flavor, yet somehow they took care of their food. It would be good to know that all peasants got a chance to live the life of high class society, and Johannes Vermeer was a respectable figure to be exact. His works brings life, show some depth, and fills wonder to everyone who looks at his artwork. The movie bring his life out just fabulous. I could buy myself a passport and travel out to see the work itself. And would be great to share it for generations to come. This movie can be shown it art school or history classes. Because there is some educational value to it. Rating 5 stars!",Girl with a Pearl Earring
27,meeza,Audible but at times you will need some earplugs for this one!,7,31 December 2004,"""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" is a period piece based on the infamous 17th century painting of Artist Johannes Vermeer (played in the flick by Colin Firth). Scarlett Johansson stars as Griet, the maid who is ordered to service the Vermeer household, which is also vacated by a domineering wife & mother-in-law. I guess there are rude ""grietings"" for Griet. However, Griet displays her true ""grit"" by unexpectedly becoming the muse of the Vermeer earring painting. Kind of ""eary"" ha! So I guess you can paint this picture: Griet becomes the girl with the pearl earring. Unfortunately, Johansson seemed ""lost in characterization"" in playing a period piece character. She was way too morbid! She should have shown more of her pearly whites than her pearly earrings! Frankly my dear Scarlett, I don't give a damn that you received a Golden Globe nod for your performance here! Your art fares better in the other lucid roles which you have mastered in the past. I drew those conclusions by sketching your brilliance in ""Lost in Translation"" & ""Ghost World"". I must say I was all ears to composer Alexandre Desplat's courtly score. Director Peter Webber's period piece was not masterful artistry but then again it did blend a few elements for a satisfactory result. *** Average",Girl with a Pearl Earring
28,Chris_Docker,Lyrical perfection if it's the sort of thing that turns you on,8,20 January 2004,"Is this an incredibly dull movie about a single painting - or is it a mesmerising and penetrating insight into art and a particular 17th century Dutch artist? It probably depends on your point of view.
Griet is a poor young girl who goes to work for the great Vermeer as a humble servant. She is pushed around emotionally by his overwrought and jealous wife, mischievous children and all-powerful lustful patron. Yet the biggest force in her life, gradually teasing out her own artistic sensibilities, is the Master himself. Griet becomes the subject of his most famous painting, lured by a mixture of dread and fascination.For Vermeer the artist, his work is all-consuming. Every part of his world  the welfare of his family, his eccentricities, his whole energy and purpose in life, is concentrated into his work. That is not to say he lacks morals but simply that his work is his higher calling. To justify such a character, we could look to the role of art and its importance. Art can be worshipped for its own sake, like some wicked effigy, and used to excuse all manner of moral turpitude in its creator; or it can be seen as the entrance by which light can enter our soul, illuminate thought and our world in a way that cold logic alone would deny us, move us beyond the bounds of our immediate impressions and let us see the world about us in a new way, inspired and informed.Griet carries this seed, to see beauty where others see only common place things, and it is a seed that the Master nourishes. There are times when Vermeer protects Griet from the people around he,r to whom she is so vulnerable, but is his concern towards her concern for her welfare, secret desire, or just a tool, an exquisite tool, of his trade?Cinema is also being part of this artistic spectrum, if we allow it to be, affecting us in ways that let the viewer grow rather than just be entertained. Girl With a Pearl Earring certainly has sufficient integrity to do that, but if one just wanted to be entertained then it probably falls short. The art direction beautifully recreates Holland of the period and Scarlett Johansson gives a very well-tempered performance as young Griet. Costumes, music and overall cinematography are accomplished and haunting without loss of subtlety, producing a memorable film for lovers of art and cinema; but if paintings don't do anything for you, this film might not either.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
29,hu675,This period drama is extremely well acted and moves in a fast paced.,9,8 April 2007,"In the late 17th Century, an quiet seventeen-year old Griet (Scarlett Johansson) is a maid in the home of Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth).

30,rbverhoef,"Slow, but beautiful",9,24 April 2004,"'Girl with a Pearl Earring' takes it time to unfold as a story, and some audiences will say it never really does. It is a silent movie about famous Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth) that could have happened. We are not sure. The movie shows us how a new maid arrives. Her name is Griet (Scarlett Johansson). Griet is told what she has to do in the house. She also has to clean Vermeer's studio and in some early scenes the movie shows us how Griet understand certain things about painting. Of course Vermeer himself sees this as well.Possible spoilers.From here we see how she becomes the model for Vermeer's most famous painting, 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' (in Dutch 'Meisje met de Parel'). We also see how Vermeer's mother in law Maria Thins (Judy Parfitt) was the real master of the house, how Vermeer's wife Catharina (Essie Davis) keeps producing children, how one of the children Tanneke (Joanna Scanlan) doesn't like Griet, how Van Ruijven (Tom Wilkinson) gives assignments to Vermeer (he makes sure Vermeer lives where he lives) and how he desires Griet. What we don't see is a love scene between Vermeer and Griet, what a lot of other movies would do. Well, we see love scenes, but not with sex. They touch each other only once that hints to more than we see.The story is a slow and silent one, like I said. The movie was interesting for me because of some strong acting, especially Johansson who is as good as in 'Lost in Translation' does a great job. The best reason to see this movie is how it looks. The city of Delft in 1665 is perfectly shown. The production design, the costumes and most of all the cinematography are great. Every new shot seems like a painting from Vermeer or another painter from that time. It looks exactly as it should, perfect.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
31,vertigo_14,A cinematic homage to 17th Century Flemish painters (not just Vermeer). (minor spoilers),9,27 April 2004,"Girl with a Pearl Earring is based on the novel by Tracy Chevalier, who tells the story of a forbidden love affair (pardon the cliché) between painting master, Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth), and the only woman who seemed to appreciate his work, a timid young maid named Grit (Scarlett Johansson).Grit is hired to work in the Vermeer household. Had you not known anything about Vermeer prior to viewing the film, it seems as though he is some deformed creature the family wishes to keep secret. The family always linger near the door to Vermeer's studio, as though something dangerous was contained within. And, as the story goes along, you might get the impression that he is a nasty fellow, the way everyone approaches the studio so delicately, careful not to disturb anything. Says one maid to Grit, he doesn't like people bothering him when he is working.In a way, Johannes is a real bastard to his wife, children, and mother-in-law. As a painter, they're never sure whether he is going to get the commissions from the arrogant, but jolly rich patron Van Ruijven (Tom Wilkinson), or whether they'll be escaping debtors by fleeing in the middle of the night.Grit is curious, and at the same time, smitten with Johannes Vermeer, probably because of the initial mystery. She gains an interest in Vermeer, and in a way, also becomes his painting apprentice, helping him to mix paints, making creative suggestions about the paintings, and so forth. Vermeer introduces her to a rather different world that Grit has never known. And the two for a silent bond, a love for each other. Johannes appreciate's Grits company as a comfortable contrast to his mother-in-law, children, and especially his wife, he only seem to try to discourage his silly hobbies.But, Johannes and Grit cannot act on their feelings for each other, at least not aloud. Divorce was highly out of the question, for one thing. But second, Johanne's was dependent on the arrogant Van Rijn for his commissions, and Van Rijn wanted Grit. Disgusted as Johannes may have been, and only slightly able to protect her (you'll see what I mean in the finale), he can't totally reject his financer. Plus, there is the barrier of master and maid, presenting a rigid social structure. And for Grit, she can only play out her affair with Johannes vicariously through her boyfriend, the Butcher.Even if the story is not grounded in fact, or is based on little fact, the story of how Vermeer's painting, The Girl With a Pearl Earring came to be is one that presents a little mystery and romance to a painting. You can find something to appreciate it, beyond just consideration of the artistic elements of lighting or coloring, etc. In fact, art is always more fun with an intriguing story behind it (consider the controversy behind Whistler's 'Peacock Room').I thought the movie did a fantastic job of recreating 17th century Netherlands. But what you may not know without having seen many 17 century painting, is that nearly every scene in the movie is constructed from 17 th century paintings, of Vermeers, Frans Halls, Van Dyke, and many others. The entire movie is, as one other viewer coined it, a ""cinematic painting,"" but not just because it is a movie about the beauty of one painting, but because it is a movie entirely constructed from paintings. It was really incredible how precise everything is. Lighting, placement of figures. The actors would have to walk around a room and then at one point, hit their points precisely (props and all) to capture that one moment reflected in the painting from which it was taken from. This is really a great film for the art direction alone.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
32,rosscinema,Understated artistry,7,8 February 2004,"The story about this film is fiction but it's based on speculation about a real painting and it's artist. Nothing melodramatic occurs here and that's the real reason why this film works so well. Story takes place in the mid 1600's where a young girl named Griet (Scarlett Johansson) goes to work as a maid for the Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth). The household is run by Vermeer's mother in-law Maria Thins (Judy Parfitt) who does her best to keep an iron fist on the goings on in her home but she also understands the importance of Vermeer and his art since it does bring in a sizable income when done well. Vermeer's wife Catharina (Essie Davis) does not understand art and she craves for more attention from him although she is pregnant. *****SPOILER ALERT*****Griet notices the paintings while cleaning the studio and soon she gives hints of understanding the art process which Vermeer finds refreshing. He orders that Griet move into the attic so that she can be closer to the studio where she can assist in mixing paints and getting the studio ready early in the morning. A patron named Van Ruijven (Tom Wilkinson) wants Vermeer to paint him a picture of Griet and this makes Catharina extremely jealous. Vermeer has her pose with a pearl earring that is owned by Catharina and Maria allows this but doesn't tell her daughter.
This film is directed by Peter Webber who does a good job of allowing this story to remain simple and not dwell on events that would take away from the more personal aspects of the characters. The relationship between the two leads is kept to a minimum and they barely touch one another. As they mix paint there is a shot where their two hands slightly brush one another and the only shot where real contact is made is when Vermeer assists in piercing Griet's earlobe. One of the interesting aspects of this story is how Griet shows that she has the instincts to be an artist but with the caste system during that period of time she has no chance to follow something that she truly has a talent in. The film does a good job of keeping the story on a realistic level and along with the solid performances this is a film that truly appreciates art.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
33,eric262003,Silent Drama That Has a Lot To Offer,8,24 December 2019,"Though he's not exactly at the top rankings of esteemed directors, Peter Webber shows he can through great lengths like all the other high prolific ones that he can turn an obscure story into gold. Webber wasn't the only person on deck who made this story rich in detail, but his talented performers did carry the film very well and his cinematographer Eduardo Serra. The visual backgrounds in ""The Girl with a Pearl Earring"" are really special and the dramatic backdrop of the story is met with a very satisfying outcome. Just like the inspiration of a painting, Webber handles every color, scenery, camera placement with the greatest of care. Even if this movie was a silent film it would exhibit great storytelling due to the way each character expresses themselves. The body language exhibited by the characters make up for the meagre dialogue and actress Scarlett Johansson seems to feel at home here as she is known how to use her expressive ways to tell her story across. Her mind and her inner feelings can be easily read.The movie fictionalizes the inspiration behind the famous painting of Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer's ""The Girl with a Pearl Earring"" in 1665. since historical period pieces claim to be based on true events, my thoughts about that are sketchy at best. Most of the film is not based too much on historical record, but from the novel of the same title by Tracy Chevalier. Luckily it is never intended to be that way to begin with. Fortunately, the dramatic tale is executed to near perfection and remains strong in its intellect and spirit.The story centres around Griet (Johansson) who becomes subservient to Vermeer (Colin Firth). She was put to work not because of her own intentions, but because her parents were financially disadvantaged and didn't have enough resources to look after her. Her life with the Vermeers was a complex one. The artist himself is quite distanced and sour and spends most of his time in isolation in his studio. His eternally pregnant wife Catherina (Essie Davis) is easily disdained by Griet's inner and outer beauty. His mother-in-law Maria (Judy Parfitt) has a tyrannical approach to the household. The children go through great pleasure to abuse her and his patron van Ruijven (Tom Wilkinson) likes her, but not in a comforting way if you know what I mean. So much to the point that he wants Griet to be next subject of Vermeer's painting. She agrees to pose for him and the tensions run thick in both envy and seductiveness. This leads to the famous painting of ""The Girl with a Pearl Earring"".A lot of stories involving painters tend to miss out on the complex and difficult life they endure making them one-dimensional and happy-go-lucky. But in ""The Girls with a Pearl Earring"", Vermeer's inspiration is deeply insightful and his creative thoughts show how complex and strategic art can be and it's not just randomized thoughts coming out of nowhere. Some of the best scenes is when Griet is working for Vermeer in the studio due to the natural chemistry between Firth and Johansson. Griet's struggles with keeping up with the Vermeer family and the disdain they have for her may be upsetting at times but it's never tedious. When Griet lets her long hair loose, you can see the lustful look in Vermeer's eyes that is both subtle and poetic.Aside from Johansson's expressive performance, the supporting players are equally effective in their respected roles. Firth is a standout as the cranky Vermeer, but seems at ease when he's in his studio painting his latest creation. Judy Parfitt is wonderful as the sharp-mouth matriarch. Tom Wilkinson is a standout as the philandering patron. And Essie Davis plays the spoiled envious Catherina to perfection. With top notch performers here our expectations are very high here and ""The Girl with a Pearl Earring"" surely doesn't disappoint. Though it's deliberately not based on concrete facts, it's still one of the better period pieces out there. Truly exceeds any BBC costume drama.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
34,bandw,Flawless,10,23 November 2006,"If you have ever looked at a portrait and wondered what the story was behind the artist and the person being painted, then I think you will like this movie. The portrait considered is Vermeer's ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" and the girl is so posed in that painting that it almost demands that you ask the question about artist and subject. I'm sure that is what compelled Tracy Chevalier to write the novel upon which this movie is based.A great premise does not always make for a great film, but fortunately this movie delivers on all fronts; I can't think of a single negative thing to say about it. The movie is slow-paced, but I would say that it is exquisitely so, allowing you to absorb its rich texture. There are so many scenes that rival the quality of a Vermeer painting in subject and color that ""Girl with a Pearl Erring"" is a fitting tribute to a great artist.The story is that of Griet (Scarlett Johansson) who, for monetary reasons, is sent to work as a domestic in Vermeer's house. Griet's presence disturbs the dynamics of the large Vermeer household in subtle but ultimately consequential ways. One of the beauties of the film is its quiet, gradual development of the relationship between Griet and Vermeer. This movie proves that sexual restraint can be more powerfully erotic than the explicit.Scarlett Johansson is particularly impressive. Since Griet is quiet and does not have much dialog, Johansson is called upon to create a distinctive personality through facial expression and body movement and she turns in a near perfect performance. Colin Firth plays the moody Vermeer convincingly, avoiding the frequently overwrought portrayals of artists. Firth and Johansson manage to depict the subdued, intense sexual tensions between Vermeer and Griet in scenes that, in lesser hands, would be routine - scenes such as their sitting side-by-side mixing paints, or looking together through the lens of a camera obscura or, in particular, Vermeer's piercing Griet's ear in preparation for the painting. The supporting cast is excellent as well - Judy Parfitt is exceptional as Vermeer's dominating mother-in-law.An outstanding feature of the film is its feel of authenticity in capturing life in seventeenth-century Delft. Walks through the city, visits to the markets, people's dress, meal preparations, personal interactions, servant's tasks, moral restraints, all come off as totally believable. The extras give the appearance of the camera's just happening on them rather than what we see in so many movies where the extras seem obvious in their placement and carriage. And the interiors of the houses are finely detailed - the trim work, floors, doors, and wall colors seem perfect for the time. Vermeer's studio is realized in a manner consistent with what we see in his paintings and we share Greit's sense of wonder when she first enters it, and when she opens the windows to let the light in.The overriding theme of the movie is that of realized and unrealized potential - Vermeer's realized and Griet's unrealized. Griet had an artistic sensibility as indicated by, among other things, her concern for changing the light in the studio by cleaning the windows, making composition suggestions, and recognizing color qualities. Sadly, she was ultimately turned out of the house due to the jealousy of Vermeer's wife and the pragmatic opinions of his mother-in-law. Griet's taking a domestic position in another household pretty much ended any artistic achievements she may have achieved, or any hopes of continued close contact with Vermeer. Vermeer is presented as a dominant, not always benign, presence - when Griet is to sit for the portrait her male friend tells her, ""Just remember who you are,"" and Parfitt warns her, ""You are a fly in his web, we all are."" Greit's receiving the blue headband and earrings at the end is ambiguous and could be interpreted in many ways. I like to think they came from Vemeer himself and it was his way of saying, ""I really was taken with you, but there was no hope of anything ever seriously coming of it, given the disparity of our stations in life and my family situation."" Speculating about the price Vermeer had to pay in domestic strife for his gift would convince us of his sincerity.This is a subtle, quiet, surprisingly erotic film of the highest quality. I will never be able to look at Vermeer portraits, or perhaps any portrait, in quite the same way again.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
35,stensson,The art of light,7,15 March 2004,"Peter Webber's film dares to have silences. Every scene is a composition, including the beautiful light. 17th century Dutch life is described in a most realistic way. You can almost feel the smell.Scarlett Johansson will certainly be the first great new American actress of the 21th century. She acts mostly with her eyes here, but that makes things a little limited. The story is also predictable and the fact that everybody speaks 21th century movie American English, although in a quiet manner, brings everything down a bit.Anyway, this is a film done in a different way, with totally respect for the baroque environment.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
36,valadas,The story of a famous painting,7,12 April 2010,"I don't know if the story as narrated in the movie is true or not but don't care about that. An artist must be free to inspire himself on real facts and fancy freely having only to obey to aesthetic values without of course altering the story message to an opposite one. The main feature of this movie are the images. The movie director and the photography director managed to recreate in a fabulous way the atmosphere of a Dutch town (Delft in the case) in mid-17h century both in interiors and exteriors. Scarlett Johansson who does the chief role has a great performance as the poor young girl who went to serve as a maid to the house of the great painter Vermeer. Her eyes and facial expression although they could seem motionless are not so indeed. They express the true emotions and feelings of a poor girl who suddenly is brought to serve people of a higher class both from the cultural and economic point of view and suddenly see herself involved in a plot of artistic seduction and sentimental trouble. Beautiful eyes and beautiful expression indeed. The story moves around her involuntary seduction of her master who, fascinated by her beauty, decides to paint her with an earring belonging to his already jealous wife without knowledge of the latter. This brings of course a lot of trouble in the house. Except for the irate outbursts of the painter's wife, the other main characters express their feelings in a quiet moving way that touches us deeply.

Olivia Hetreed's script and the direction by Peter Webber adhere to this ideal. In her imaginings of what the girl with the pearl earring was like and what her life was like, I believe Chevalier thought it would be romantic in an artistic sense to have Vermeer's interest in her be artistic and not carnal. It is obvious from the exquisite beauty of the painting (actual title: ""Girl in a Turban"") that he very much admired her. It is difficult for me to believe that in that admiration he did not also feel some desire for her.Be that as it may--and I certainly respect Chevalier's interpretation and in fact think it makes for a more interesting story than if there had been some sexual involvement--Vermeer's wife, Catharina, sees in the painting beauty that she herself does not possess. She also cannot help but wonder just what it is that her husband and the pretty young girl do during all those hours upstairs. Yet, the emphasis is on Catharina's jealousy of Griet's beauty and not on any imagined infidelity. I think this is consistent with Chevalier's interpretation of what the relationship between the maid and the great artist might have been.This movie surprised me in how beautiful it is and how carefully Peter Webber reconstructed 17th century Delft, Holland. If you go to the IMDb you will see that there were some goofs and anachronisms, such as a person in the background in one scene riding a bicycle. However, the Holland of 340 years ago seemed authentic and graphically atmospheric, including all the chores Griet had to do and the errands she had to run--note her red and bruised hands. (They used lye in soap in those days.) Still the open air market could have used a few more flies (ha!) and the butcher boy (Cillian Murphy) was entirely too pretty (ha!), but Vermeer's studio seemed magical and I love the mixing of the colors and the way the light came through the windows. There are at least three Vermeer paintings in which we see the same light from the same window: the title painting; the painting he was working on without the chair in the foreground that Griet removed called, ""Young Woman with a Water Jug""; and ""The Painter's Studio."" If I made a list of the most beautiful films I have ever seen, Girl with a Pearl Earring would make the list, along with, e.g., Zhang Yimou's Raise the Red Lantern (1992) and Stanley Kubrick's Barry Lyndon (1975) and maybe a dozen more.As for Scarlett Johansson who had the title role I must say she won me over. At first I thought she was a bit too voluptuous for the part. (It is interesting to compare the reconstruction of the painting with Johansson with the original shown at the end of the movie. The real girl was a bit more delicate and of course not as sensual as Johansson.) Johansson won me over because of the subtly of her interpretation and because of the hard work she obviously put into the part. She is an actress we will see a lot of in the future. If you want to see her in less severe garb, catch her in Sofia Coppola's Lost in Translation (2003) where her sensual beauty is more fully presented.Colin Firth very much caught the intensity of the artist and seemed to do so almost without effort. His eyes beheld Griet and indeed all the world not in a carnal way, but in the penetrating way of the artist who wants to see the world as it really is, not as our needs demand. We see this in the scene in which he insists that Griet see the real colors in the clouds, not just the white that we think we see. Note too (continuing Chevalier's theme) that it would be inopportune, careless and threatening to his artistic career for Vermeer to have an affair with the maid since with his mother-in-law in the house and his wife and some nosy, tattling children, he would have been caught. Vermeer only completed about 40 paintings in his lifetime. His wife (or most especially his mother-in-law) was indeed his most important ""patron."" An artist without a patron sleeps in the streets, especially in such a mercantile world as a small town in 17th century Holland.Catharina Vermeer (Essie Davis in an under-appreciated role) provided exactly the right counterpoint with her vile, snake-in-the-garden-of-artistic-eden presence and her purely burgher mentality and her oppressive jealousy and her high-handed treatment of her servants. Without Davis's excruciatingly vivid performance this movie would have flat and lack in tension.As for the ending and for the inevitable comparison with the novel, let's say the ending here (and the question of Griet's future life with the ""butcher boy"") is more open to interpretation than in the book where more is explained. (See my review, or better yet read the novel.) The strength of the book is in how deeply we can go into the mind of Griet and into the artistic intimacy of her relationship with Vermeer, whereas in the movie we can more fully appreciate the atmosphere and the beauty of the artist's vision.By the way, in the novel it is clear that Griet does indeed desire Vermeer but realizes that his station is too much above hers, and his circumstances with five children and a sixth on the way leave no room for her. Also clear in both mediums is the fact that Vermeer's exquisite portrait is, in effect, his way of making love to her.",Girl with a Pearl Earring

Scarlett Johanson is an amazing actress, her eyes alone speak volumes in every scene.But all the performances were magnificent apart from Colin Firth who seems to have joined the David Morse school of acting.... all pained expressions and an almost somnolent presence.The script is faultless and the cinematography breathtaking. The director did not go for the cheap ending either or sully the whole thing with an inappropriate boink scene. Judy Parfitt is wonderful also, a most under-rated actress. Every time I see her, it is like meeting an old friend and standing in awe of their fresh accomplishments.

Why was the wife so upset about the earrings? What was the deal with the old guy? How did the daughter figure in all this? Whatever happened to the butcher boy? It's a simple enough story. Artist paints portrait of young wench. Young wench gets ears and other parts of anatomy pierced. But for almost 90 minutes we look at people standing around with profound expressions. (Well, there were two pretty profound temper tantrums.)In short it's one of those film festival thingies where the cognoscenti stand around at the reception following the screening and offer profound judgements on all the profound facial expressions, profound camera angles and profound sound effects. (Never did figure out whether those strange noises on the other side of the wall throughout the film were supposed to be Dutch rumpy-pumpy or just bad plumbing.) It's nicely enough done, sort of like a beautifully photographed postcard from someone you don't care about in a place you don't want to see.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
41,Rogue-32,"Erotic, hypnotic",9,2 February 2004,"I haven't read the novel that this film is based on, but I would imagine the author would be extremely pleased with the screen adaptation of Girl With A Pearl Earring. Instead of an over-wrought,  melodramatic and heavy-handed piece of drivel, we are treated to the exact opposite: a magnificently restrained, hypnotic and sublime work of near-perfect art.This is a movie about what is NOT being said - a movie about nuance, layers of nuance; the opening shot of the onion being peeled is not coincidental, nor is the way Colin Firth (extraordinary as Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer) explains to his young protege and model that the colors in his paintings are added one step at a time.   The rich and provocative emotional layers of the story are handled masterfully and with great subtlety throughout, and Scarlett Johansson is the perfect choice for Griet; her scenes with Firth resonate with profound mutual understanding, unfathomable depths of recognition.  At its core, this is a film very much like Johansson's other recent wonderful film, Lost In Translation: two frustrated and trapped people  - one an artist, one a potential artist - beautifully and wordlessly mirroring each other's souls.",Girl with a Pearl Earring

43,FilmOtaku,"Beautiful, but dull",4,4 October 2004,"After being assaulted by the Vermeer-painting cover of 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' in Barnes and Noble for months after it was released, I finally acquiesced and bought a copy. The concept of the novel is a fictional exploration of the creation of that Vermeer classic, and suggests that the model is Grit; a young girl in 1600's Holland whose family falls on hard times after her father is blinded, so she is sent to work for the family of Johannes Vermeer, the master painter. She does the back breaking work for the family and deals with the many difficult children and the mistress of the house, but then eventually strikes up a friendship with and develops romantic feelings for Vermeer, culminating with her posing for the painting.While the story is obviously not true, I find the concept of theorizing about the origination of great works of art intriguing, so I really enjoyed the book. Unfortunately, the film 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' directed by Peter Webber wasn't as enjoyable. The film was admitted beautiful, particularly the cinematography. There were some beautifully framed shots that looked like they would have inspired any of Vermeer's Baroque contemporaries. I found the performances to be hollow and boring (someone needs to convince me sometime that Scarlett Johansson is anything but vapid) and there was absolutely none of the emotion conveyed in the film that was so pervasive and almost tangible in the book. It takes a special film to coast on its merits merely by looking pretty, but 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' is not one of them. While I encourage the study (albeit fictionalized) of great artists, this is just too boring of a representation. 4/10, and only for its cinematography and lighting.--Shelly",Girl with a Pearl Earring
44,gelman@attglobal.net,Like Watching Paint Dry,6,31 July 2004,"Girl with a Pearl Earring gives new meaning to the phrase ""like watching paint dry.""   Although Scarlett Johansson is beautiful and bears a startling resemblance to the girl in Vermeer's famous painting,the film is slow and undramatic.   I haven't read the novel (and don't intend to after seeing the movie).   I assume, however, that it attempts to get into the minds of both the model and the painter.   That's something filmmakers attempt more often than they achieve because it's exceedingly difficult.   Girl with a Pearl Earring comes nowhere near the mark.   Colin Firth broods handsomely and Johansson manages nicely to hint at deep-lying feelings but it isn't enough to carry a film that is short on action and has absolutely nothing to say about artistic creativity.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
45,RResende,Hyper-realism and light,8,1 September 2007,"Light as a cloth: The window was opened and the light got in. It covered surfaces, it covered someone. With Vermeer, it's all about pointing out personalities through shadows and soul-defining surfaces. The dutch XVII's century produced Vermeer and Rembrandt. Both changed the meaning of light in composition and content and wrote a fundamental chapter in visual construction (composition). But while with Rembrandt we have light as a focus, which dominates and drives the other elements, whose personality and meaning are shaped and bended to that light the painter chooses, with Vermeer we have other situation: light as a cloth, tranquil, blissful light, the one that comes through glass on a sunny yet clouded morning. Usually he always uses the same kind of light, and allows it to uncover what there is to uncover in the model (""you looked into my soul""). The final result is like a photograph of a character, below the surface (like the dark camera which ""shows"" the painting). This is a very fascinating theme, and in what concerns cinema it is, to my view, at once very hard to work out and very fascinating. This is because cinema is primarily, to this moment, about image, and this theme is so about image that makes it cinematic to the core. So, forget stories, forget conventional narrative, to do this, one will have to do it visually. And ask light for a help. This is where Eduardo Serra comes in. It's not common for me to agree with the majority of the opinions on which are the highest points in the careers of people, but here i do believe all about this film had the perfect measures of Serra's work. And he delivers it. All cast and crew (obviously this is exaggerating) is here to provide Serra with something to photograph. And he performs Vermeer so well... Photography is the strongest presence of Vermeer in this film, his light is a character. It doesn't really ""exist"", but it's so physical here. So this would be hyper realism in cinema; Truer than truth. Firth would be apparently a miscast, but he stands alright here and Johanson here is all about face, lips, hair and look. That's how she fits.My evaluation: 4/5 A very good film about painting which actually is coherent with the art it depicts.http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com",Girl with a Pearl Earring
46,petarmatic,So interesting and captivating.,7,17 April 2014,"What really impressed me about this film is a hidden eroticism in it. At that time Holland it was unthinkable of what today Holland has plenty: legal pornography and prostitution. I always had a feeling that such painting with a hidden dose of eroticism is a precurse to what will come much later, sexual revolution and total openness inside human sexuality. I derive it from the heretical sect of the Adamites, who were by my opinion sexual revolution before sexual revolution.Film captures that well or at least gives us a small nudge into the whole thing. Cinematography and costimography are so excellent, true holiday for the eyes. I wish they will make more films of this kind.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
47,FloatingOpera7,A Vermeer Painting As A Film,10,3 May 2006,"Girl With A Pearl Earring (2003): Starring Scarlett Johansson, Colin Firth, Tom Wilkinson, Essie Davis, Judy Parfitt, Cillian Murphy, Joanna Scanlan, Alakina Mann, Chris McHallem, Gabrielle Reidy, Rollo Weeks, Anna Popplewell, Anais Nepper...Director Peter Webber, Based On The Novel By Tracy Chevalier, Screenplay by Olivia Hetreed.Often, films adapted from novels rarely follow the essence of its literary influence. But this is not so with ""Girl With A Pearl Earring"", which despite gorgeous Hollywood cinematography, is faithful to the spirit of Tracy Chevalier's novel. Filmed on location in Europe, the mood and overall patina of the movie manages to reflect the time of Vermeer and his world. The costumes, the crowd scenes, the cobblestone streets, the interior of the homes of both rich and poor, the marketplace, the Delft, the way the personages interact with one another, is rich with historic insight. But the one thing that this film is missing is a certain dramatic liveliness, although I can understand that Director Peter Webber was aiming for a film that would fit into a Vermeer painting itself, which means there is very little noise, much pensive silence, statue-like poses, light and darkness, play on light and color and stillness. This is not even a movie that has any true exciting elements or climax which builds up from the beginning. For rising young American actress Scarlett Johansson, the role of maid/model Griet did not do much for her in the way of drama (all she did was look pretty, keep her mouth shut, display passivity and pose, model-like for Vermeer) but it provided her with the experience of being part of a fine film about art, which looks good in an actress' resume. Colin Firth is a nuanced, engaging Vermeer, not portrayed in a heroic or favorable light but as a deeply flawed, mean-spirited, financially unstable underdog to his wealthy patron. Because at this time artists depended on the sponsorship of the nobility, he was always at risk of losing their respect and losing his means of living. His wife Catarina(Essie Davis) is superb as a pampered Dutch upper-class girl, completely isolated from her servants, shrewish and harboring a secret jealousy. Vermeer's relationship with Griet is far better in its chemistry than that of his actual marriage and this makes Catarina bitter because Griet is of ""a lower class"" than hers. Tom Wilkinson portrays Vermeer's older, greedy, wicked patron, the wealthy Pieter Von Rujven, who has his eyes on Griet himself. The difference in classes is well-rendered in this film, as is quiet emotions that are nevertheless passionate. Griet loves Vermeer for the innate mystery of his being, and perhaps for the fact he is unlike the men she has known. Of course, there is the ever-present master and servant romance. The film is wonderful in many ways, except in that it can become long and sleep-inducing, much like staring at a Vermeer gallery of paintings for far too long. But this is a brilliant film and one worthy of more attention. I resent the Oscars snubbing this film. It has a lot to say without saying it. There has never been a more artistic-looking movie. Doubtless, it received praise and critical acclaim, but not enough to make this movie mainstream. It can even be said it's art-house. Fans of these types of films will eat it up and fans of Miss Chevalier's best-selling novel will be delighted.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
48,bopdog,So thick with arty style it almost suffocates; but nonetheless is entertaining overall,9,24 July 2005,"This movie is clearly well made, and clearly well written, well designed, well acted, and well-everthinged. Overall, I enjoyed it, and appreciated the very subtle characterizations and enigmatic ending. However, I must also remark that the style was so thick, so artsy and even painterly, that I felt close to suffocation at times.Scarlett Johansson is tremendous, Colin Firth is tremendous--- heck, everybody did a great job. But I did feel, at times, drowning in a sea of style and BBC-ish drawing room sloooooow drama that made it so that I couldn't watch more than 10 minutes of this movie on the DVD at a time. It took a week to finish seeing it, and honestly, the acting was masterful--- but like golden treacle, white bread, and broccoli, for me a little goes a long way. Maybe that merely proves I'm a Philistine, but there you are. It probably earned a 10, but given my slight aversion to the stilted and over-thick atmospherics, meaning I was entertained and impressed, but not enthralled, I gave it a 9 out of 10.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
49,lawprof,An Intriguing Cinema Palette of Many Hues,9,13 December 2003,"Novelist Tracy Chevalier didn't have to worry whether his much praised novel of the same title as the film under discussion tracked history accurately. Johannes (Jan) Vermeer is a true mystery in the annals of art.In his career Vermeer executed a number of masterpieces although the attribution of his name to some are academically challenged.  Remarkably, he is to painting what Anton Webern is to classical music - another man who left mysteries but few works.  Thirty-six seems to be the maximum number attributed by some scholars to the Delft artist.Taking a novel to the screen is often perilous but director Peter Webber is faithful to the book.  More importantly he has fashioned an intriguing and visually mesmerizing recreation of late seventeenth century Delft, a Dutch city in which culture, abject poverty, and licentiousness co-existed.On the cover of the 11-18 December issue of Time Out New York is a picture of ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" female lead, the remarkable teenaged (she's nineteen) Scarlett Johansson.  Even more remarkable, a magazine that devotes much of its weekly space to steering readers to everything in Gotham from dim sum to dominatrixes gives a strong review to what likely will be a film that won't break out of art houses.Johansson is Griet, a servant girl who takes up her position in the Vermeer household out of necessity.  Her parents warn her as she goes out in the world not for her fortune but for sustenance to beware of being seduced by Catholics.  This was still the time of fervent and sometimes violent abrasive relations between the followers of the Holy See and those committed to a stern but increasingly rational Dutch Protestantism.Griet finds herself in a household living, perhaps, beyond its means. Vermeer isn't turning out many canvases.  Portrayed with intensity but also a certain English gentlemanly manner by Colin Firth, he paints to satisfy one rich patron, the licentious and libidinous Van Ruijven.  A truly nasty character, he covets Griet and knows that the Vermeer household exists or falls on his largess. Vermeer's mother-in-law heaps such extravagant praise on the patron's artistic taste that he responds in self-defense that she could sell ""sour milk to cows.""  Vermeer recognizes her role in holding the family and his future earnings in taut reins.  Firth seems unable to assert himself with his family, hiding a lot in his studio.Van Ruijven is a detestable character, one familiar to every age, a man for whom rape is a convenient alternative to seduction.  But how moral is Vermeer who brings the beautiful Grivet up from scrubbing floors first to serve as his assistant and then as the subject for one of his undoubtedly great works, ""Girl With a Pearl Earring."" (The painting is exhibited in The Hague.)   Webber and Firth's Vermeer is no sexual predator but ultimately he does not recognize, much less accept, the burden that follows his exploitation of a young girl despised by his wife and daughter and tolerated by his controlling mother-in-law/business manager.Moving slowly across the screen is this film's rich tapestry of colors and moods.  Johansson, whom I first really noticed in the recent ""Lost in Translation,"" projects a wide emotional range that brings her character to life.  Wilkinson's talent comfortably inhabits the raunchy but rich patron whose aesthetic tastes, arguably of dubious depth, are secondary to his quest for recognition and immortality through paintings.Special kudos go to cinematography director Eduardo Serra. He merits an Oscar nomination.  Skillfully taking Vermeer's subdued palette in hand, he translated it into a dreamlike and beautiful screen painting of the Vermeer household and Delft itself. At points in the film Vermeer's paintings blend into his world, a clue as to his inspiration and genius.Scarlett Johansson is a very serious young actress who ought to continue making serious art films. Her acting captivates.If this film doesn't screen near you, please look for it when it becomes available for purchase or rental.9/10.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
50,movieguy1021,Girl with a Pearl Earring: 3/10,3,21 February 2004,"It's hard to think up ideas for novels. So hard that eventually you make a novel that's a fictional story about a painting. When it gets down to that, it's sad, but then when they make a movie about it is the lowest tier. That's the case with Girl with a Pearl Earring, an insanely overly dramatic version of Tracy Chevalier's supposedly acclaimed novel. The results by this half-baked script by Olivia Hetreed are unintentionally hilarious. I mean this, I was almost rolling on the floor with laughter during this movie.The script here is, as I said before, laughably bad. Every other shot where there's dialogue (which is extremely scarce) someone's spewing some sort of pithy quote or another. And they aren't the type that can be used as signatures on message boards, they're just blatantly scripted and worthless. Another example of this script's atrocity is when people look at paintings. When Griet (Scarlett Johansson) sees a painting of her, she doesn't say something like ""It's beautiful"". She doesn't even say something like ""It brings out my eyes."" She actually says ""You saw right through me!"" I didn't know dialogue could get this bad, but obviously it can.Every single character overacts so much they deserve to have their own soap opera. In fact, Girl with a Pearl Earring is basically a 90 minute long soap opera set in the 17th century. Actually, I wouldn't be surprised if ABC picked it up for next season. Anyway, Johansson, brilliant in Ghost World, The Man Who Wasn't There and Lost in Translation, but here she goes for a ""subtle"" performance, and, to tell the truth, it's horrible. She is constantly mugging to the camera by not being able to keep her face still for even a seocnd, and she can't accurately portray a servant from that time. Colin Firth, playing artist Johannes Vermeer, seems to understand the time period more, but when not yelling for no particular reason, just doesn't work. Every other small character in this underdeveloped film goes for the way-too-loud method of acting and just had me cracking up.I saw Girl with a Pearl Earring about a week before the Oscars, for which it had three nominations. It did, in fact, have good cinematography, but the costumes seemed to be derived from history books and looked pretty cheesy. I'm not very familiar with art direction, so I can't comment on that, but thankfully it wasn't nominated for anything sound-related. Whenever people talk offscreen, it's obvious that those people are just in a recording booth, talking into microphones. Whatever authenticity there was disappeared then. The music score were pretty good, albeit repetitive. Because of the mix of cinematography and music, GWAPE wasn't torturous to sit through, but just because I survived it doesn't make it a good movie.My rating: 3/10Rated PG-13 for some sexual content.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
51,ruby_fff,A beautiful painterly film -- satisfaction enhanced by Alexandre Desplat's hauntingly flowing music.,7,7 January 2004,"Besides having the feeling of the whole film is literally like a painting -- cinematically delivered in shades of subtle colors and painterly light, Alexandre Desplat's score for ""The Girl With a Pearl Earring"" is simply entrancing. The music elegantly flowing -- leading us from one scene to the next, be it Scarlett Johansson's Griet in the kitchen or backyard, basement or attic, braving the hailing snow or leisurely walking along the tree-lined river path with Pieter (Cillian Murphy), and, of course, in the artist's studio with Vermeer (Colin Firth) -- satisfying enchanting moments easily experienced. What a filmic idea conceived around practically just one hauntingly beautiful painting by Vermeer. How the story is weaved and spun into intriguing vignettes, spiced with rude strokes when Tom Wilkinson's Van Ruijven appears, setting off uneasiness similar to having to perhaps erase or paint over uneven hues and hence the compromise. It's the resulting intensity and passion to complete the masterpiece of a work forever intriguing to look at -- as the haunting refrains repeatedly enhance the progression of the film. It's not a grand film per se like the scope of say, ""Cold Mountain"" or full of drama and action like ""The Last Samurai,"" but I felt so good after viewing the ""Girl With A Pearl Earring"" -- I was simply smiling beside myself. What an enjoyable movie experience. You might say it's quietly beautiful and intriguing at the same time. My filmic appetite was thoroughly satisfied that afternoon.Scarlett Johansson's superbly sensitive portrayal (as the girl with traumatic experience over her loving horse) in Robert Redford's ""The Horse Whisperer"" 1998, impressed me more than the Thomas-Redford pairing. Then in Terry Zwigoff's ""Ghost World"" 2000, a complementary supporting role to Thora Birch, but front and center as the defiantly determined daughter in Eva Gárdos' ""An American Rhapsody"" 2001, opposite Nastassja Kinski. Same year, she played another maturing young lady role opposite Billy Bob Thornton in Coen Brothers' ""The Man Who Wasn't There"". Of course, in 2003, her much praised performance opposite Bill Murray in Sofia Coppola's ""Lost in Translation"" -- and Scarlett's only a 19 year old in Nov '03. Her portrayals are always so poignantly vulnerable and strong at the same time. Her first 2004 release will be ""The Perfect Score,"" a group of late teens hacker-like movie (along side Erika Christensen of ""Traffic"" fame), seems like a reprieve from her string of 'pseudo adult' roles.Colin Firth in costume roles -- very first one comes to mind is his Mr. Darcy opposite Jennifer Ehle in A&E series of ""Pride and Prejudice"" 1995. He was Valmont opposite Annette Bening in Milos Forman's ""Valmont"" 1989. Of course, the unforgettable modern day Mr. Darcy opposite Renée Zellweger and Hugh Grant in ""Bridget Jones's Diary"" 2001, and in the stellar ensemble cast of ""Love Actually"" in 2003, as a writer chasing after a Spanish-speaking love of his life -- comedic tempo, he also has.

The movie is a fictional tale but it puts the painting in the right context of life in the 17th century. Staring Scarlett Johansson as the seventeen year old Griet, the subject of the painting, the story is of lost innocence and the passion of an artist working on capture natural beauty.

53,buiger,"Good, but...",6,7 December 2007,"This is a critics' film. This not to say that it is bad, on the contrary, but is one of those movies that seems to be especially made to play to their sensibilities, to hit the mark with the ""intellectuals"". And it does.To me this was an above average movie, but nothing else. Yes it does have some very nice, very sensual moments, and it does a good job of of explaining how an artist 'ticks', but it could also have been much, much better. For example, we get very little insight into the psyche of Griet, what she thinks, feels, what her ambitions and aspirations are, what she really wants. Consequently, we find it very difficult to feel for her.Secondly, the set decoration (especially the outdoor scenes) look artificial and fake. Nowadays we know we can expect much better in that department (I therefore fail to understand the academy's nomination... surely you shouldn't get an Oscar nomination for set decoration just because the film is a 'costume drama'... or should you?).Last but not least, the movie feels far too 'ordinary', almost like a made-for-TV-movie. It lacks that extra something that would make it special and elevate it to being a great film. Without it, this is not a bad film, but is surely soon to be forgotten.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
54,TaylorYee94,"Implicitly and reservedly sexual, thus elegantly romantic",7,18 August 2021,"There is not a single scene that shows bare skin of Vermeer or Griet. They do not touch each other or even remain in the closer distance for too long. However, sensuality between the two attracts the audience. 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' symbolizes rather than shows. A scene where Griet finally uncovers the veil, shows her hair, lets it down, and meets Vermeer's eyes is colorful, lustrous, and desirous. In other movies, this would not mean anything, but her continuous reluctance to take off the cover gives special meaning to it. More important scene where Griet asks Vermeer to pierce her ear to hang a pearl earring alludes their consummation. No nudity and no obscenity, but that scene is enough to maximize the erotic between the two.Johansson and Firth's performance takes a great part in completing the romance just with gaze and eye contact. Firth expresses his passion and desire nonverbally yet so manly and romantically at the same time. Johansson also demonstrates her purity, her maturing over time, and her temptation so marvelously without saying much.I like how the film spares the respect to Vermeer. By displaying some of his works on the screen and Firth explaining the use of color and light, audience get to enjoy Vermeer's art. Also, infatuation and sexual tension originated from forbidden extramarital relationship are not all to their romance. Her appreciation of art, her respect and admiration of his talent, and shared passion in painting make their relationship more divine.The comparison between Griet and Catharina Vermeer has interesting ironical structure. Catharina belongs in high class but has no class or taste while Griet is filled with class and style, but her status is low.The weakness would be 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' is a diluted watercolor painting. The storyline itself is very simple, but the writer could not make it colorful and dense enough.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
55,Dockelektro,Like a painting,8,22 February 2004,"It could be expected that this would turn out a pretty delicate movie, after all, how can you explain the story behind such a delicate painting? It would also be expected that this movie was made with the craftness of such paintings, but really, not at this level. With the tender touch of art, this slowly paced journey into the feel of 17th-century Holland is as delighting for the senses as it is for the eyes. You could almost smell the varnish. The story is surprisingly minimal, the dialogue even more. But they're fit for such a work. But even if the story or the actors are not jaw-dropping (they're all adequate and solid in their roles), the way the film is shot really is. It's like the movie was drawn on a canvas. The man responsible, Eduardo Serra, is as essential to the movie as any of the major players. Many scenes look intentionally like real paintings, and it's that feeling of looking into a work from Vermeer or Rembrandt - the only way we picture this century, after all - that gives it its sheer brilliance and grasp. But of course, such a story has also great poignancy, specially on the way the relations between the characters happen (all that innuendo between Vermeer and Griet is incredible). A movie of rarely-seen craft, that is a faithful hommage to the painting around which it revolves.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
56,barberoux,Delightful,9,6 February 2004,"""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" was a delightful movie.  Fans of Vermeer will be enthralled by the cinematography.  The lighting used throughout the movie has the same luminous glow as his paintings and many scenes evoked scenes from the paintings.  The set designers and costume designers did a fantastic job capturing Vermeer's household.  The first scene to feature the studio was wonderful.  There was the map on the wall and the rug on the table, the chair and other props seen in the paintings.  Acting was good throughout and Scarlett Johansson was wonderful.  It was a quiet luminous movie.  Don't miss it.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
57,Bob Pr.,A visual masterpiece; emotionally satisfying.,9,7 April 2004,"Those who need action, chases, fights, sudden twists of plot -- stay away, you'll be disappointed.  But those who enjoy lower key slice of life stories, beautiful photography, psychologically true to life films made with subtlety, taste, and great intelligence will be well rewarded.Not much is known about Vermeer's life. He and his wife had 14 children (11 survived) and they lived with her mother in her home -- a woman apparently supportive of Vermeer; she possessed some paintings and was distantly related to a painter. Vermeer died at the age of 43 in 1675. The novel by Tracy Chevalier takes the paucity of information, some characters from Vermeer's paintings, and weaves a plausible story.  The film uses that novel as a springboard.I'd looked forward to seeing this film for some time because Vermeer is one of my favorite artists. I was lucky to arrange to see the huge Vermeer exhibition at the National Gallery in 1995 which displayed almost all of his known paintings, assembled from 13 museums and private collections. The film briefly shows Vermeer's knowledge of a ""camera obscura"" which he was one of the earliest artists to use (it projects a photographic-type image onto frosted glass).  My only disappointment was that it didn't show how small his later painting became -- some of his best known works, e.g., ""Girl With the Pearl Earring"" is about 17"" X 15"" while ""Girl With the Red Hat"" and ""The Lacemaker"" are only about 9"" X 8"".As the time to see the film got closer, I worried that it might either conflict with or taint my appreciation of Vermeer.  I needn't have worried -- it left Vermeer intact and still somewhat mysterious.  Most movies define only one or two characters and paint the others with just a few details we use to imagine the character.  In this case, the servant girl (""Griet""/Johansson) is fairly well-defined and, to a slightly lesser amount, Vermeer's wife (""Catherina""/Davis), mother-in-law (""Maria Thins""/Parfitt), and the villain (""van Ruijven""/Wilkerson). But of Vermeer (Firth), we see only his intense interest in his art, an erotic interest in Griet, and his self-control.  All were well played, Johansson's Griet especially. 
The photography was gorgeous and, in portraying everyday 17th century Dutch life, it captured the spirit, the lighting and composition of many of Vermeer's later paintings. Other paintings make fleeting cameo appearances on the wall or in the studio. The view of Dutch    upstairs/downstairs life was fascinating.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
58,galensaysyes,"Paint me, paint me",4,4 October 2006,"This is so sober and carefully lit that it doesn't immediately betray how screwy it is. It's about a Valley girl unaccountably placed in 17th-century Holland, where she stands around staring at everything slack-jawed, as if the camera always catches her just after another ""Ohmygod."" That is about the extent of her capacity for action. Fortunately her family have arranged a job for her as a maid in the household of the Rochester-like Jan Vermeer, and possibly for that reason she takes advantage of every opportunity to pose like a Vermeer subject until he finally notices and paints her portrait. He won't paint just _any_body, and so in addition to her unfailing knack of placing herself in the most flattering and Vermeer-like light, she is also possessed of a sensitive and instinctively knowledgeable appreciation of art. Her gifts naturally don't sit well with her betters, and most of the drama in this slim little story consists of her travails at the hands of various enemies, including the painter's snitty-snotty daughter, his even snittier-snottier wife, and a patron who is _too_ admiring of her. The sum of what we learn of them might normally fill an hour, but in this film events pass slowly enough to double the time. To give the illusion of progress, whole stretches of the movie have music laid in more or less at random, sounding as if it had been recycled from a different kind of movie, like that werewolf-story-that-wasn't. Scarlett Johansson is a blank, but apparently that's what she was hired for; Colin Firth, Judy Parfitt, et al. obviously are good actors, and give good performances--within the limit that almost nothing any of them do is like anything real people would do in the same situation. I also observe that the painter in this painterly story about a painting hardly ever paints. It's a piece of classy filler that will serve to pass the time until a real movie comes along.

60,mrcaw1,Pretty but slow..ie. pretty slow......,10,8 September 2004,"Glad to see they made a movie about Vermeer using his lighting techniques in the movie itself. As recorded in other comments there is not much dialog in the film. Lots of atmospheric shots with not much action per se except for Scarlett Johansenn mixing paint, walking around the artist studio etc. One thing I did find very funny is the idea that Vermeer would have been influenced in his painting choices, composition etc, by someone who is basically a skullery maid. Sorry but I think it's definitely a 21st revisionist's idea to put forth this supposition. For example, Scarlett's character must be very careful not to move anything in Vermeer's painting model-setup, a chair, etc. Yet one afternoon, she looks at the painting in progress and decides that a chair in Vermeers painting should not be there, so she removes the real life chair from Vermeers mock-up. Later, Vermeer notices this and decides that she is right and erases the chair from his painting. Later he asks her why she moved the chair! Yikes! It all got a bit contrived and pompous at that point. Poor Colin Firth. What happened to his performance? He basically uses one expression throughout the film. That of p*ssed off. Combining this with the horrible hair extensions/wig(?) they had him in and his character is woefully petulant throughout the flick. Johansen actually does manage to keep the audience interest though she better be carefull not to let her soulfull, furrowed brow look become too much of an affectation. Judy Parfitt, as Vermeers mother-in-law,is one of the better attractions in the film. She's an accomplished actress one should keep an eye out for. She was particularly good in the Kathy Bates flick, Dolores Clairborne where she utters the infamous line...

62,Ronin47,Beautiful but yaaaaaaaaaawn (**),4,31 January 2004,"As a general rule, I'm not too into period films, especially the period this film is set in (1600's). That doesn't mean I don't give them a chance or that I've never seen any good ones, just that they're not my favorite kinds of movies. ""Girl With A Pearl Earring"", centers around the famous Johannes Vermeer painting of the same name (if you don't recognize the title, you'd recognize the picture) of a servant girl wearing a pearl earring.
Colin Firth stars as Vermeer and Scarlett Johansson (who was the main reason I went to see the movie) stars as Griet, the servant girl who becomes the model for the painting. This is a fictional story, only an idea of how the events leading up to the creation of the painting may have happened. In this story, Griet is a good servant girl, but her eyes light up at the sight of Vermeer's art and the prospect of a better life. Vermeer takes a liking to her as well, and a tentative relationship is hinted at.
It's all just very, very slow. This is the kind of movie that I would never say isn't well-done (the acting is fine, the cinematography is gorgeous, and the ending is just right), but it's just not my cup of tea. I respect it, but didn't get much enjoyment or satisfaction out of it. If it IS your type of movie, you'll probably love it.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
63,QueenMakeda84,Golden Silence,3,4 August 2005,"For playing a chick who didn't have much to say, Scarlett nailed it. If you wanna watch and follow someone on screen who doesn't do much, that's pretty amazing. She's enchanting on screen. Quickly becoming one of my fave actresses. I admire her acting style and hope to adapt some of it to my own. Some find her a bit too quiet and mute to find any potential in her, but that's precisely why I like her. You find her quiet presence refreshing and real. Chattiness is not a familiar trait in most human relations, so why behave as if it is? The movie was slow and boring for most of its length, but you watched for Scarlett. Cillian Murphy was burgeoning himself, but you didn't care if he was there or not. Colin Firth was not the choice I would've made, and the fact that he wasn't first choice showed. You just didn't want to pay attention to him, even though he was the male lead. That's pretty sad. Griet's blossoming relationship with Cillian's character was OK, but the lovemaking seemed out of place for what parts of the relationship you saw. It just seemed as if she couldn't have Vermeer, so she settled for this cat as some kind of replacement. I just didn't get the scene. Perhaps if Scarlett fleshed out the silent nature of her character a bit more, I would have understood the need for the sex scene. It was greatly executed by the way. Illicit, intense, and passionate, yet at the same time, seemed a mere fling. A great paradox for a simple scene. I don't recommend the film based on its plot, but for the nuances of Scarlett's acting and the gorgeous camera work.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
64,lbournelos,Not what expected,7,3 September 2018,"I knew Vermeer from his painting, but, I had no idea of his personal life. Even if he was such a chicken as he is presented in the film, I think this could not be considered as an essential part of the play, to spend so much time on that.Apart from that, Colin Firth, an excellent actor, did not change his expression throughout the film, while Scarlett kept the same slightly open mouth expression (with two exceptions) from start to end.I gave a 7 taking into consideration a lot of other qualities, but I still think that the director and the main characters of the play better attend a movie school before filming.Rather disappointing, I'm afraid.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
65,diand_,Painting on movie canvas,6,26 July 2005,"Girl with a Pearl Earring is an imaginary story around one of the most beautiful paintings ever made. As Vermeer is all about breaking and reflection of light (besides composition) a lot of attention is paid to art direction and cinematography (both Oscar nominated with the costume design). Especially Eduardo Serra's cinematography impresses here, trying to recreate Vermeer's paintings. There is one shot that almost reaches that goal: When Griet is dismissed and comes down the stairs and looks to Tanneke in another room the light and colors are almost perfect. But as in Andrey Rublyov we end with a long shot of the true painting and immediately realize the impossibility of what they were trying to do: putting form and content on one line.Vermeer had a humble background. As most actors think they are in a British upper class drama here, we get the mannerisms and theatrical behavior belonging hereto. It all feels highly unlikely that these people are so eloquent and well-behaved. Colin Firth, an actor I generally do not admire, has a better clue and is appropriately subdued here. Scarlett Johansson does the best and most interesting job here: eyes, eyebrows, lips say more then the limited amount of time she speaks verbally.In the beginning there's also a short hint of the difference between Catholicism and Protestantism but it is not touched upon later in the movie. Although the movie has the right rhythm, the direction is here at the TV-level, where Peter Webber's background lies.Would Vermeer live today, he would certainly be a filmmaker using the movie canvas as a painting canvas. Take a look at Rivette's La Belle Noiseuse if you like to see another beautiful movie about the relationship between painter and model.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
66,AZINDN,"Too Many Hens, Too Few Roosters",8,25 July 2004,"Introspective and ambiguous are the work of the brilliant 17th century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer.  So little is known of his life that in translating it to the screen in the fictional account, The Girl With a Pearl Earring, the film at times seems equally filled with blank spaces.  The story of a lowly scullery maid, Griet (Scarlett Johanson) whose family must send her to work in the chaotic and expanding Catholic family of the painter, Vermeer is stage for the drama of too many hens, too few roosters.  Status and riches are the concerns of all who surround Vermeer including his shrewish but beautiful, vacuous wife and her ambitious, manipulative mother (Judy Parfit).  While the lecherous attentions of Tom Wilkinson's character, a bourgeois patron whose purse forgives his boorish manners adds insult to the beauty of his Vermeer collection.Colin Firth as Vermeer is a posterboy for the passive-aggressive husband, loath to most of his household until Griet catches his attention by her ability to recognize the elements which motivate the painter -- quiet, and good color sense. This is not an overwhelming art film in the sense of angst, a la Van Gough, but it suggests Vermeer was motivated by something more than light and domestic interiors.  As Firth presents the painter, he is a pawn between duty to provide for his always growing family, and his desire for someone to understand his attention to detail, color, and composition which Griet, in her silences seems to provide. While the quietness of both servant girl and painter infuriate some, it is the space provided by their quietness that is the most productive. Everything around the couple is cacophony except in the studio where the only sound that enters are the muffled noises below the floor.As Griet, Scarlett Johanson is compared visually to the sublime painting, but has little resemblance to the actual model who looks more like the French actress, Julie Delpy than Johanson.  She is only competent in the role of tentative servant without conviction in several scenes where she is put upon by her betters.  While Griet slaps the face of daughter, Cornellia, an evil brat whose own story -- the Bad Seed -- was yet to be written;  Johanson often seems overwhelmed how to portray the passivity a maid in her situation was required. She simply displays deadpan for every emotion.  Perhaps it is the Americanness of Johanson that shines through, but one half expects her to snap her gum and blast rap music from her iPod while cleaning Vermeers studio.  She is simply too modern in her body movements to convey the 17th century with believability. What wins the film is the stunning cinematography that lights the dim house setting with scene after scene taken from Vermeer works.  It is the catalyst that permits audiences to set aside the irritating street scenes with butcherboy (Cillian Murphy) to await with anticipation for the next views of exquisite shots of domestic scenery.  It appears as if Vermeer had lit the film himself.  If he had, could a film look any better?  Overlook Johanson and enjoy the peace and view.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
67,StevenKeys,Girl with a Pearl Earring,3,6 September 2021,"A beautiful painting that needed no movie but deserved better than it got.Dramatization of Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer's making of his oil on canvas depicting a winsome girl with a pearl earring, red lips and patient eyes, believed to've been made in 1665 and previously known more widely as Girl-with-a-Turban, a screenplay based on Tracy Chevalier's 1999 book of like Pearl title.How factual or not is the film is of no serious concern as the screenplay (Hetreed) is of no serious merit. If you want to watch a wife who suffers throughout (Mrs-V), a husband painter largely oblivious to that state, a charm-less model and her beer-swilling, ne'er-do-well boyfriend who wins the prize, this movie is for you (oy). Had Webber & Co. Better understood the worldwide affection that grew over the subject model unknown with her simple beauty and the desire to see her come to life (something I'd never wished about the unnatural Mona Lisa), and found an actress, not simply good-looking (Johansson) but whose face had even slightly resembled the legend's, it would've made a difference. As it was, viewers were unable to make the connection, probably felt a bit betrayed, or at least unappreciated by the makers, and then the uninspired story made it all moot. My advice: buy the t-shirt and miss the movie (1/4).",Girl with a Pearl Earring

There, she not only catches the eye of the painter but also that of the Van Ruijven, the regular patron.Torn between the good match of the butcher boy and the impossible love of Vermeer, Griet allows herself to be made love to in paint rather than physically in what is now one of Vermeer's greatest works.Languid and flowing, this film has the air of a masterpiece. With beautiful music and a great story it flows with great easy and surprisingly little dialogue. Johansson does a great job as the tortured Griet but Firth still has the air of Darcy about him, something I'm not sure he'll ever live down, and that takes away from his role.All in all, this is a wonderful film well worth watching.8/10",Girl with a Pearl Earring
69,Caps Fan,A Disappointment (spoilers),5,12 January 2004,"Tracy Chevalier's novel ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" is rather a special book in many ways. Though slow-moving, it is nevertheless light and readable. There is sexual and artistic tension present from the moment Griet, a young Dutch girl whose tiler father has been blinded in an accident and who must now support her family, goes to work as a maid in the household of the painter Vermeer.The film is also slow-moving, but is much heavier going, so that it teeters on the edge of tedium at times. No balance is struck between sexual and artistic tension. Instead, the former is emphasized to the almost complete exclusion of the latter.Meanwhile, the characters, particularly Vermeer's wife and mother-in-law, are mostly much nastier than in the book. Griet looks half-witted for much of the time. As for Vermeer himself, Colin Firth does not seem to know what to do with the part. It doesn't help that he looks more like some sort of 1960s radical than a 17th century painter.The script and music are unmemorable, but the film has some visual power. The scene where we view Griet for the first time as she will eventually appear in the painting might, on its own, make it worth buying this movie when it eventually comes out on DVD.I hope someone films this again one day. Sticking closer to the spirit of the book might produce something of a classic. In the meantime, this version must rate as a disappointment. Rating: 5/10.",Girl with a Pearl Earring

That's all fine if they want to offer their conjecture, but it's just psycho-babble from people looking for something deep and profound in this film, when it doesn't even exist. The girl mixes paint for the guy and at one point she moves the furniture as a suggestion for a better pose.  Other than that, we see her wash bedsheets, prepare salads, sniff raw meat and other menial household chores.  If people want to find the deep meanings in all of that, go for it.

73,eamon-hennedy,"Beautiful, a lovely film.",10,26 February 2004,"Let me get this off my chest, I am not one for period dramas. I usually turn over when the BBC put one on during a rainy Sunday night and I never usually rush to the cinema to see a film set so far in the past. However, this film peaked my curiosity. It looked beautiful, visually, and I felt that the story seemed interesting. I was glad I took myself to see it. I loved every minute of it. It may be quite early into 2004 but this is already shaping up to be one of my favorite films of the year, alongside another Scarlett Johansson film, Lost in Translation. Girl With A Pearl Earring has a lot going for it. It has some of the most beautiful cinematography, the story is superbly told and the two leads have to be the very definition of sexual chemistry, they are good looking and play their parts with severe conviction. This is a true love story and like Lost in Translation, we have a love story that is played without any sex (except for one moment that does not involve the two main characters together).The performances from Colin Firth and Scarlett Johansson are two of the best you'll see this year. Johansson is shaping up to be a major little starlet, her radiant good looks and convincing acting ability meaning that the tag of 'next big thing' looking likely to come true. Her performance as Griet is mesmerizing. Her pitch perfect delivery of her dialog and her haunting looks are almost Oscar worthy, possibly more so that in Lost in Translation (which was to a certain extent more of Bill Murray's film). One can feel her emotions throughout the film, from developing feelings for Vermeer to her bitter anger at Cornelia for trying to destroy her standing in the household. This young woman has a big future ahead of her. Then there's Colin Firth, playing the brooding love interest with a deep intensity. Actually that's the type of part he always plays, from the BBC adaptation of Pride and Prejudice to it's semi-modern equivalent Bridget Jones' Diary, but let's face it he plays it so well that he is practically the only actor that can play such a role. While Mr Darcy in both Pride and Prejudice and Bridget Jones' Diary are his signature roles as far as popular and public opinion go, Vermeer is his signature role artistically. He pulls you in with his almost frightening devotion to art that you can't take your eyes of him and when he does delve into the more emotional side as he develops feelings for Griet and brings her into his world you find your heart opening up to him too.Peter Webber's direction is flawless throughout the whole movie, while the music score from Alexander Desplat is haunting and memorable too. This is simply a magnificent film from beginning to end. I never thought I would say this about a period drama, but I loved it and I can't wait for a chance to see it again.Quite simply superb.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
74,imxo,See This Beautiful Film In A Movie Theater,10,23 February 2004,"Art embarrasses some people, so it's good to be aware that this film is not only about art but is, itself, art. Ultimately, though, I believe almost everyone can find something to like in this film if watched alone. In other words, it's probably not suitable for the guys' Friday night out. Nevertheless, it does deserve to be seen in a movie theater. I can't imagine absorbing all this beauty on a small screen.The film begins very slowly, and gradually tapers off - just as a sunset can be slow - and extraordinarily beautiful at the same time. In fact, it is one of the most visually beautiful films I've ever seen. The acting is very subdued - and very, very good. It is acting by expression and nuance, rather than acting through dialogue, and the actors are uniformly outstanding, not just the main protagonists Colin Firth and Scarlett Johannson. I would especially like to commend the acting of Essie Davis, whose Catherina is hardly a sympathetic character. Ms. Davis did a marvelous job with it. Finally, I would like to say how wonderful it is to see an American actress such as Ms. Johannson in such a sublime European film. Not to make too much of it, I think that it shows that there can be a depth to Americans that goes beyond the caricatures we present of ourselves in the public arena. How good is this film?

It's beauty not only dazzles the eye, it touches the soul as a true work of art does. Based on the Tracey Chevalier novel, the film has been made selectively, focusing on the main elements of Vermeer's household maid and his relationship to her...and to the crass appetites of his patron.  Peter Webber directed this work with the sensibility of a poet...and chose Eduardo Serra to create the cinematography with the eye of an artist.  Colin Firth as Vermeer, a dedicated painter with a perfectionistic sense of art as a transcendant medium, brings to the role an intensity, a sensuality in his artfully subtle facial expressions.  Dialogue is kept to a minimum.  The director realized that more can be said in small gestures, in a look than in a volume of words.  Scarlet Johansen, certainly the primary player, as Griet, the housemaid with an innate understanding of art's value, creates an amazingly mature portrayal of the character.  This is a young actress of enormous talent. The images of this film have stayed with me with a haunting quality... they move and stir with their color, their changes in shadowed light...the way great music lifts beyond the interpretative constrictions of the mind.

I was amazed at the poverty of Colin Firth's performance.  He must have hated his role; even so, I didn't know he was capable of such a low.I gave the movie a vote of ""2"" for the interior scenes.

I was recommended this movie by a friend who raved about it; but to make the movie, they left out everything that lets you understand the story. Who are the players, what are their names, what is their place in the story, how do they relate to the rest of the characters? Halfway into the movie much is still unknown unless you read the book first. I went back, purchased and read the book. Only then could I understand the story laid out in the film. With the knowledge of the whole story in mind, the actors really do bring the characters to life, but without reading the book, the story is a mess. In fact, read the book, forget the movie.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
79,majic-5,Painterly subject and presentation,7,11 November 2007,"Girl With a Pearl Earring is the fictional story behind the creation of Johannes/Jan Vermeer's painting of the same name. This movie is not only for art-house crowd but for the art gallery crowd. The cinematographer,Eduardo Serra, presents the film as a series of painterly shots, with all the richness of color and exacting detail as the Dutch domestic paintings in the period in which Vermeer painted his famous work (mid-17th century). The tension created by (a) the beautiful camera-work and outward stillness, and (b) the mounting, unspoken pressures on the Vermeers and their maid (the model for the painting) propel this film with a minimum of storyline.The storytelling contains a minimal amount of dialog, and a maximum of facial expression and body language. Given that the protagonist is a maid in Vermeer's household and is paid to work a lot and not talk much, this is appropriate for her. Most of her facial expressions are in the neighborhood of fear, as she realizes that Vermeer and his patron are both using her for their own purposes, without a care for her fate. Vermeer, by a series of looks that alternate between strain and intensity, reveals that he's consumed by his art, not connecting to his wife (except to keep her pregnant) or his children, and uncomfortable with needing a patron to pay for his passion. The wife, alienated from her husband but bound to him by her Catholic vows, shoots daggers at her husband and every model Vermeer picks with her eyes, and conveys a bodily unease about the precariousness of their financial position. The grandmother, keeping her face taught and stern most of the time, projects the iron authority necessary required to provides the financial and physical discipline in the house.The patron, with limited on screen time, has the majority of the speaking lines. Played to perfection by Tom Wilkinson, the patron displays full comfort, and more than a bit of cruelty, in brandishing his economic and social clout. For example, at the unveiling of a new painting at Vermeer's house, he casually lets fly the announcement that he's commissioned someone other than Vermeer to create the next work of art for him. His slight smirk at the muted twitches of anger, disappointment, and panic in the Vermeer family is all the audience needs in order to understand his sadistic pleasure.As you may have inferred by now, not much goes on in the film in terms of plot. The major conflict is Vermeer's repeated choice of and focus on women other than his wife. Granted, they are chaste artist's models, but Vermeer gives them all his energy. With his latest model, the maid, Vermeer finds a fellow artist, an illiterate girl who has an eye and an interest in color and composition. Vermeer's wife senses the heightened competition for her husband's attention, and matters proceed from there. This is a very interior type of movie, finely wrought with wonderfully nuanced performances from all the major cast. It's a nice change of pace from most films, and the gorgeous visuals boost the films watchability.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
80,HardKnockLife210,Art Translated to Film,9,20 November 2004,"Some movies are based on historical events, others are based on the writer's life, and yet others are based on the director's innermost fears and/or desires. It is evident that Girl with a Pearl Earring is based on the Tracy Chevalier's novel of the same name. Yet director Peter Webber has taken her novel and given the film a unique identity, seemingly basing the movie more on a work of art than on words on a page.Girl with a Pearl Earring is a very theoretical movie, its entire premise being a fictional account relating the creation of a famous work painted by Johannes Vermeer. Vermeer is played quite brilliantly by Colin Firth, who embodies the personality of the quiet artist. Scarlett Johansson does a good job playing Griet, an innocent girl who begins to work at the house of 'Master Vermeer,' and it is not long before Johansson and her love of art catch Vermeer's eye. The movie continues on quietly and mysteriously as Vermeer's relationship with Griet develops. During all this, the production remains first-rate. The minor characters put in performances that do not take attention away from the central story, yet that are excellent in their own right. The essence of the art upon which the movie is based is beautifully captured by director of photography Eduardo Serra, as the colors of the film blend to create the atmosphere.However, the beautiful art often takes away from the story, causing the viewer to feel strangely distanced from the action on screen. After the film, it is not the story that sticks in the mind, but instead the colors and shadows. Also, Alexandre Desplat's beautiful, Golden Globe-nominated music adds much to the film's mood, yet his score is so repetitive that it takes away from the depth of the film.Overall, Webber's movie is extremely well-done, and the film possesses the beauty toward which many other films can only strive. Nevertheless, it could have become a masterpiece had a few of its tiny flaws been corrected.Final Score: A.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
81,abum190,Brilliantly layered movie,9,20 August 2006,"One of the slowest-moving movies I've ever seen, and yet it's constantly moving. The fact that it is slow allows us to see everything, and this is a movie in which seeing everything is important- every glance, every movement adds to the many levels that exist within this world. The story and its idea are intriguing in themselves, but they would be nothing without the captivating cinematography and the intense acting. It's a beautiful movie to look at and everything is captured so vividly, you never miss a thing. The actors help this along- Scarlet Johansson plays an introverted girl, but we still manage to understand everything she is feeling. Colin Firth is so restrained and subtle in everything he does, most of the time we have to imagine what he is feeling. But there are moments where we understand exactly what is going through his mind. And that is as it should be. He is the mystery in this movie and the movie knows that, and yet allows a few glimpses into his mind.Don't see this movie expecting explanations- it will give you none. Everything is implied, and that is what is so masterful about it. There are better movies out there about love and passion, no doubt, and more entertaining ones. But this movie isn't about entertainment, and it's really not even about love or passion. It's about the things we hide and the feelings we keep to ourselves, and in that respect, it is wonderful.If you can appreciate the layers of a movie's artistry, acting, and story, then, by all means, go rent this movie. You won't be disappointed.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
82,keith-moyes,"Pointless, plot less and clueless",3,14 February 2006,"When this movie was first released it was well received, but I was sceptical. I have just caught up with it on DVD and my scepticism has been justified.A movie about Vermeer designed to look like his paintings struck me as being one of those ideas that seem great when you are falling asleep at night, but in the cold light of dawn suddenly seem daft. Painting has survived the assault of photography precisely because the world does not look like paintings and art transforms experience rather than simply recording it.I have no objection to the performances (Scarlett Johansson, Colin Firth, Tom Wilkinson and Judy Parfitt are all fine) but I couldn't see the point of the whole exercise. It tells us precious little about the act of painting and not much more about seventeenth century Delft. It drops in a few contemporary ideas, like David Hockney's contention that mirrors and lenses were much more widely used by painters than has been recognised by art historians, but does not follow through on them. We see Vermeer take delivery of a camera obscura, but never see him use it.Call me a Philistine if you like, but the emperor has no clothes! This movie creeps along at a snail's pace: looking good but saying very little. It is a long haul at 95 minutes and in its rough cut of three hours and twenty minutes it must have been unendurable.This literally was like watching paint dry.",Girl with a Pearl Earring

But I left the theater feeling I'd missed something. Or, that something was missing. I know: Inspiration. This is a film about the process of art, and it did an ok job of showing us a young woman's coming of age through the discover of her powers of perception. I appreciated the tact and subtlety employed throughout, but I felt that the characters were lacking...fire. Aren't artists supposed to be driven? Firth's Vermeer came across as, well, Colin Firth with longer-than-usual hair. He didn't seem to posses any of that otherworldly passion real artists exhibit. While Johanssen's Griet was convincing as a mysterious young woman, too much was kept under her cap. Her passions were also maddeninglysubsumed beneath propriety. But perhaps that's due more to the period of time she had to deal with. (I felt extremely claustrophobic by the end of the film, much like how I feel strolling through certain sections of classical art museums. I am glad to be born in this time!)Most of the characters were fairly predictable and two dimensional. Only the mother-in- law surprised and intrigued me. You could tell she had to juggle the demands of reality against aesthetic and personal desires.Overall, I'm glad I saw this film, but it really made no impact on my life, nor taught me a thing about Vermeer.7 out of 10.",Girl with a Pearl Earring

85,gus120970,Pearls before swine,8,13 February 2006,"Let's put aside the arguments of the historical accuracy and liberties that Tracy Chevallier in her novel of the same name, and by extension the director, may have taken with the life of Vermeer. If those kind of liberties are unforgivable then we should all be out burning the works of Shakespeare. Girl with a Pearl Earring is best judged on its considerable merits as a piece of thoughtful drama, with a rich and consistent sense of art direction that attempts to capture some of the trademark light and compositional aspects that mark out the great painter. Vermeer lived in the most exciting time for Dutch art, indeed for the whole of the Netherlands, which was experiencing its 'Golden Age'. His own life appears to be unconventional - he married across the religious divide, fathered a very large family and resisted the urge to move to an Amsterdam increasingly fashionable with artists, instead remaining in Delft and painting very distinctive, pared-down canvases. The film works on these scant facts to paint a picture (no pun intended) of a man alienated from his family and his dependence both on the dubious patronage of a local merchant and his hawkish Mother in Law. Into this tense and cramped environment comes a serving girl who has not only a fascination and awe, but a transcendent understanding of his art. There follows the painful, and not overly speedy it must be admitted, transition for her from viewer to subject: with its attendant consequences. Very little is conveyed by dialogue, and the long static scenes may infuriate or simply bore some watchers, but being left to make an interpretation of the characters motivations and inner feelings for yourself is consistent with the whole process of viewing a painting. I must admit being drawn in to the whole slow-moving, exquisite experience.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
86,TooShortforThatGesture,Zzzzzzzz.,4,11 November 2003,"Okay all together .... a biiiiiiig Yaaaaawn.This is a VERY pretty movie.  Many lovely set pieces, the cinematography is remarkably true to Vermeer.The story, however, is just sort of silly.  There is little tension.  What tension there is feels invented at all times; it hardly flows reasonably from the characters or the situation. Moreover, there is little sense that the events of the movie are of significant consequence to the characters themselves --- except that Vermeer is going to paint the eponymous painting --- but we know that going in. But then again, it would be hard to craft a story flowing naturally from these characters, since they say little and do less.   The screenplay must have been 6 pages long.  Instead, we are treated to lots of long slow shots of the characters' faces as they react to something (often the long slow shot we just saw of another character's face).  Or the camera locks in on a long shot of a character in a room or on the streets of Delft (which does emphasize the pretty cinematography, so perhaps they decided to go with their strength).  Presumably we are meant to read the subtext of the story into these long moments, but the story is too thin and obvious to warrant the effort.  In fact, the story isn't much more than a very timid soap opera plot.  Unfortunately, Scarlett Johnanson's performance doesn't always hold up under the camera's relentless scrutiny --- there are just too many times when she ends up with a generic ""puzzled/troubled"" look on her face as she stares at the camera --- rather as if she had been directed to try to to divide 83 by 17 in her head while the camera rolled. This isn't a horrible movie.  Just one that ranks as a waste of time, as far as I'm concerned.  I was going to give it a three but went for a four because, although I did find the several scenes of paint being dramatically mixed to be almost laughable --- all I could think was ""well, at least it's not as dull as watching paint DRY.""",Girl with a Pearl Earring

One is astonished at the quiet dignity that this great artist imbues into any of his  chosen subjects, no matter how obscure their social positions.  It is so with this movie; a lovely, clever fiction (and it is fiction) that draws one ever deeper into its own light, its own subtlety. More is conveyed in one look than in a dozen pages of dialogue.

88,halcyonbear,Looks beautiful but feels rushed.,7,16 August 2019,"I haven't read the novel by Tracey Chevalier on which this film is based because it might give more insight into what is an otherwise good film. Usually I complain about films being overlong, but if anything I think this needed to be expanded. The characters of Vermeer's wife and daughter are crying out to be given a bit more depth. We know that the household is an unhappy one, but I felt that these characters and their motivation was overlooked. Even the character of Griet, the very focus of the story comes across as two-dimensional at times. This is down to the writing and Scarlett Johansson does her best with what she has been given to do. It's not a bad film, it just feels like it could have been so much better given more time to explore the characters.

Just the kind of movie that can tell this story the best.Many other comments have noted the value and draw this film will have to those who love biography movies - especially those of the art masters. The central story is fiction but the story is hung on a remarkable truth and a wonderful masterpiece - commonly called ""The Girl with the Pearl Earring"", but was first know as ""Girl In a Turban"" or ""Young Girl"". The inclusion of the reference to the pearl earring began in the second half of the twentieth century.I generally fight movies that rewrite history but this movie makes no pretense of being historical fact.

90,krisrox,Let there be light,7,16 March 2010,"Thanks to the overzealous trailer, I waited over 3 years to see this movie. Being from Delft myself, Vermeer and his city are sacred to me, and I couldn't stand the thought of Firth, Webber and Johansson hitting the wrong notes in this highly romanticized version of Vermeer's life.Finally seeing it, I was reminded that we should take trailers as seriously as book covers and DVD box copy writing. This is a slow-paced movie that's heavy on beautiful cinematography and scores massive points for recreating Vermeer's majestic light so well. The production team just nailed the interiors, and seeing the paintings suddenly spring to life was a great experience.Firth was good. He doesn't look like Vermeer, but he succeeds in capturing the artist without unnecessary embellishments. Johansson easily carries the movie - I periodically forget what a fine actress she is, and she had the hidden advantage of actually looking Dutch. (Yes - unlike the rest of the cast, who looked positively British, French and Irish.)Two problems: the outside scenes had all the hallmarks of a director running out of money, and I was semi-offended by the suggestion this was Delft. (The set looked like a strange cross between Venice and Bruges, conceived by an art director convinced ""Paris"" is the capital of ""Europe"".)

92,ArdentViewer,Somewhat Disappointing,4,17 January 2010,"I just saw this movie on IFC. I hadn't heard anything about it when it came out so although it is 6+ years old, I really didn't have any preconceived notions about it.The movie was visually interesting and appealing (especially in terms of costumes, setting) and the music was lovely. However I was not very impressed with the story and plot. I really like Colin Firth as an actor but I do not feel this is one of his better performances. Scarlett Johansson was good with what she had to work with, but I have seen much better performances from her as well. I understand that she was playing a serving girl of the time, who would have been meek and obedient and would not have spoken that much, but there was only so much she was able to convey with her face and her eyes. I found the entire film to be slow-moving. I kept waiting for the pace to pick up but alas, it was not to be.I think in many cases, the relationships and the characters in the film were not well-developed. Most characters seemed to be rather one-note, one-dimensional. Vermeer was difficult to read. You could tell he cared about his art but I don't feel you really got to know him as a person and realize what made him tick. Vermeer's wife was jealous and shallow and high-strung. Her mother was an opportunist and seemingly emotionless. The art patron was filthy dirty with no moral fiber. The little girl with the curly red hair was mean and manipulative. The butcher's son Pieter (Cillian Murphy) was seemingly present merely as a person to lust after Grete (Scarlett Johansson). I didn't think their romance was believable and I found it unlikely that Grete would have been so chaste in her master's home, so virginal, so innocent, and then would have behaved the way she did with Pieter. It seemed very out of character, since in those days, most women were proper until they were married (other than those belonging to the oldest profession). I don't believe they would have so much as kissed before they were engaged and I'm not sure they would have been permitted to spend time alone as they did in the film.For some movies I am able to suspend my disbelief if I am caught up enough in the characters or the story. But with this one I just kept thinking of all the historical inconsistencies or other things that seemed to be unlikely.Towards the second half of the film all we see Grete do is help Vermeer mix his paints and sit with him as a subject. She is not participating in any household duties. Despite the scene where it is stated that Gerte is needed in the house because the wife is with child again, I don't think she would have been kept on with her actions (even if they were not of her own accord0. They could have easily replaced her, as I'm sure there was no shortage of peasant girls needing work. I know, too, that Grete was the subject of a commission but then again, she did not need to stay on as a servant for this to accomplished. I also found it unbelievable that Vermeer would have stood up to the patron for a mere servant girl. Since the patron originally requested that Grete sit with him I cannot believe that Vermeer would have or could have changed his mind. After all, she was a servant, unimportant, replaceable, and Vermeer would have been at the mercy of his patron, as many artists were at that time. This was his source of income and he could not have taken that lightly.I realize that this movie was based on a novel, which probably took many historical and artistic ""leaps."" Even so, when you watch a historical picture, you expect it to be somewhat historically accurate. The story may be embellished, but the context and the behavior should be more realistic with the time. Otherwise, we can have the story take place in modern times with our values and codes of conduct, and there would be no reason for it to be a historical film.As far as period pieces go, I was not very impressed. As far as movies in general, I feel the same.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
93,toast-15,mixed feeling,8,21 April 2008,"I gave this an 8 but it left me decidedly with a sense that the movie was unfinished. It also was a bit confusing as it shows that the family is completely dependent on their patron to commission paintings. Yet when he wants a servant painted, the wife flips out when she finds out. Where does she think the money is coming from? Wouldn't it be obvious that a painter, one who makes his living painting beautiful things for others to buy, would want to paint beautiful scenes, people, events? Did the wife ever think that he would only paint ugly people? I know there's supposed to be a hidden love story here but to me, it was more of a friendship, an understanding of art. I loved the scenery, I loved watching this film, but the main plot and the conflict were, I thought, kind of ridiculous. Does the wife want to eat or does she want her husband to sell paintings? It was stupid. Any mother would opt to have her children fed over the dislike of her painter husband painting a salable, commissioned portrait. I'm being too logical I guess, using common sense over drama. I simply could not suspend my disbelief long enough to buy the main plot line. But again, the movie as a visual display, was rich and very appealing. It was like watching a portrait in motion and in that respect, I found it quite beautiful.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
94,rum2550,"Cinematically, Unsuccessful.",5,5 May 2010,"I generally love movies made on historical backdrops. But I felt something wrong with ""Girl with a pearl earring"" from the beginning. Some art loving viewers have mentioned that people who do not have an interest in art may feel this film boring (due to their ignorance?) I do not like to accept that point. If you're a good filmmaker you can't make films targeting a certain category of people. I guess it is a talent of a good filmmaker to make a person interested in a subject that he/she previously unfamiliar with. I would like to take ""Perfume; the story of a murderer"" as an example. Like this movie,""Perfume"" is also based on a book, almost similar backdrop (18th century Europe) and on a subject that we're not much familiar with (making of perfumes) However, ""Perfume"" manages excellently to keep the audience attracted to the movie from very first scene to the end.(even though it is a rather lengthy movie) I guess the main mistake is poor adaptation of the story from the book to the movie. It is generally accepted that when you're making a movie from a book you have to do some adjustments since they are two different media. For example, see Gye Richie's ""Sherlock Holmes"". Even though ""Sherlock Holmes"" novels are legends, if Richie had made a Sherlock Holmes exactly as depicted in the book, it would have never been a successful movie.",Girl with a Pearl Earring

Glad I could get that off my chest. Actually, I watched this movie for a second time exactly in order to see SJ at her best after that rather dreadful music video that came out recently which I won't name in order not give it even more publicity. This film and 'Lost in Translation' are two of her most outstanding movies. I reckon with these like that even while appreciating even most of the bit parts she had in movies here and there. She is just magical in Griet's role, even in the kind of 'chador' she's wearing and with the few lines she speaks (both being realistically treated constraints of social status on Griet's character), and I hope to see much similar stuff from her in the future as well.",Girl with a Pearl Earring

98,rj-27,Esthetically brilliant,10,3 February 2005,"There is nothing about this film that cannot be summed up as one of the most esthetically brilliant movies ever made. The moment of each scene is as though captured on a similarly conceived work by a Dutch master himself.But what of the storyline? It tells of a snippet in the life of Johannes Vermeer, one of the more highly regarded of the old Dutch masters, that attempts to explain the origin of one of his more unusual and enigmatic works, Girl with a Pearl Earring. The post-medieval time of Dutch-European Holland is vividly recreated as the backdrop for a character study of the brilliant painter. His relationship with his wife, one of quiet submission, his matriarchal mother, and his most important patron - upon whom the plot for the reason for the paintings commission and therefore its reason for being - are deftly handled.It is of course, though, in Vermeer's relationship with the assumed model for the painting, his maid, that the power of the story resides. There are several scenes that build one upon the other, that construct the ever growing sensual connection that comes between Vermeer and Griet. It climaxes at the point where Vermeer's hand gently removes a tear from Griet's cheek when she cries from the brief pain of having her ear pierced for the wearing of the pearl earring of the title. It is a magical, almost overpowering moment where you half expect them to forget who they are and abandon themselves to their feelings for each other. I say only half expect because both understand their station, master and maid, and he married at that, and so nothing will come of it but a separate longing for what cannot be.Highly recommended for those who appreciate esthetics in all aspects of a films creation: cinematography, set design, score and direction.",Girl with a Pearl Earring

Colin Firth and Scarlett Johansson were at their best.  The class separations were so distinct, and the pecking order of society was shown so well.  First, the aristocratic Van Ruijven, to whom everyone bent over backward to please.  Why not?  He was the bread and butter to Vermeer and his family with his many commissions he awarded to Vermeer.  Vermeer's wife was selling off her jewelry just to keep the family going.  But, as dependent as Vermeer and his family were to Van Ruijven, so were the maids of the household to master Vermeer, his wife, his mother-in-law, and mischievous daughter.  And then you even see the maid Griet talk down to people in the open-air market (eg, the buying of the fish scene).  So the pecking order goes down and down.

100,Norwegianheretic,MISSING THE POINT,5,2 December 2003,"Despite the fact that considerable technical skill went into the recreating of Vermeer's lighting, there is virtually no evidence of Vermeer the painter in GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING. Instead of exploring the work of this genius, the master is trivialized with a dull, uninspired melodramatic story. That one should spent the length of a feature film considering the superficialities of the relationship between Johannes Vermeer and his wife, his maid, and his patron is evidence to me that, despite all of our electricity, we are living in a truly dark age.In 1977, a Dutch director, Jos Stelling, made a film, unjustly ignored, about Rembrandt. His work, REMBRANDT FECITE 1669, re-created more than the artist's lighting, he re-created the man's soul. The camera moved in accordance with the painter's sensibilities, the story moved similarly. This film was a meditation on the man's work, a true attempt to re-create the time in which he lived. Vermeer deserved but has not received the same treatment.The fundamental problem with GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING lies in its presumption that Vermeer's personal genius had something to do with the man - as a husband, a lover, a son-in-law, or whatever the hell else he was. What is missing entirely is that Vermeer had a talent and sensibility for capturing the most ineffable qualities of life - his was a gift of observation, not participation. What happened in the artist's personal dramas is completely irrelevant to the more lasting sensation of his method of observing.

My painting mentor used to say that every inch of the canvas has to be perfect.  That is how i would describe this movie. Every scene is meaningful, beautiful. Scarlett Johansson is simply wonderful. I liked her in Lost in Translation, but she is absolutely superb in this one. I am very disappointed that she did not get the best actress nomination for this movie. 
I would not look for historical accuracy in this movie. The purpose is not to reveal historical facts, but rather to imagine a story behind a famous painting.  The art direction, costumes, the original score, all are fabulous, but what really makes it all work is the cinematography and Johansson.  The cinematography is one of the best I have ever seen.  This movie deserved more than 3 Oscars.  It may appear slow to some people that like 'action'.  For me, time stood still while I was watching it.  Every image was perfect.

102,SteakSalad_101,A beautiful film that's as fun to study as a Vermeer painting itself.,8,23 December 2006,"I had to watch this movie for literature class and, judging from the past at the HORRIBLE books we have read for that class, expected this movie to suck badly. I was pleasantly surprised to know that it didn't! Girl With a Pearl Earring explores a theory of the biography of the largely unknown life of artist Johannes Vermeer, and his painting ""The Girl With a Pearl Earring,"" whose purpose still remains unknown. Scarlett Johansson plays young servant Griet who moves in with a very wealthy family consisting of the painter Vermeer, his wife, his children, and his mother-in-law. Vermeer spends all of his time in his private studio painting and does not let anyone in the house enter. Eventually as Griet works in the house Vermeer grows attracted to her and begins to paint her in his studio without the other mean-spirited owners of the house not knowing. The story progresses and is ultimately a very mysterious movie that uses a HELL of a lot of symbolism in every way, and every shot of the movie seems like an actual Vermeer painting. The movie explores with a theory many rumours whirling around the life of this painter and makes for a very interesting film. Definitely recommended, especially to those who love art and/or Vermeer.",Girl with a Pearl Earring

104,mcgriswald,A masterpiece of art direction and cinematography,8,25 April 2006,"After reading several of the negative comments, I feel compelled to point out that anyone watching an historical film needs to understand that we are all products of our own times.To suggest that anyone living in a time when class distinctions were set in stone, and religious propriety was the rule should have their characters developed according to our modern expectations misses the point.This film is clearly not for everyone, but for anyone who has taken Art History 101, and has familiarity with the Dutch Masters, you will be amazed at how the lighting and camera work mimic the paintings of that period. The film appears to plod along, yet each extended shot is clearly designed to echo the techniques and colorization of that school.The plot of this film is relatively simplistic, yet like the camera work involves a great deal of shading and subtlety.Griet, our protagonist and subject of the film title (Scarlett Johannson) is grateful to have a position with the Vermeer household, but torn by her extreme awareness of her class and her adherence to norms demanded by her Calvinist upbringing. When she is noticed and later used as an assistant/model by Vermeer who has a reputation for his unseemly behavior with previous maid/models, she is keenly aware that working with him will not only jeopardize her job, but also ruin her reputation within her own community.In one telling scene during a modeling session, Vermeer asks Griet to remove her Puritan style cap, and her reaction can only be compared to that of a devout Muslim woman being asked to remove her burkha. When Vermeer finally persuades Griet to exchange the cap for a cloth wrap, he spies on her as she changes in the closet. Griet sees him looking at her hair, and her reaction is as if he had caught her naked.I gave this film 8/10 stars, not because its plot riveted me, but rather because it is possibly the most beautifully filmed movie I have ever seen.",Girl with a Pearl Earring

So please skip the rest of this.  We saw two movies today.  ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" and ""Something's Gotta Give.""  ""Something's Gotta Give"" was wonderful.  This was not.

GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING tells the story of an illiterate peasant girl, Giet, who becomes a maid to save her family from destitution.  Her service is in the household of the artist Johannes Vermeer where her beauty attracts the attention of the men and the jealousy of the women.   Vermeer lives in a house of harpies with a horrible mother-in-law (who holds the purse strings), a shrewish wife and a daughter, who, although only a child, is a bitch on wheels.  Giet's world is grim, grim, grim, but she manages to inspire Vermeer to paint one of his most memorable works.  The film is beautifully photographed and brilliantly acted.  Ms. Johanssen is simply remarkable.  She has very few lines.  Her face is so subtly expressive that I felt I could read the character's mind. It's a heartbreaking and beautiful performance.  I won't be surprised if she gets an Oscar nomination.  The supporting cast are all first rate, especially Judy Parfitt as the dragon-in-drag mother-in-law.

107,train464,A Moving Picture of a Painting,6,17 May 2004,"This is a strange movie. It is a moving picture, in that the pictures move, and it is a moving picture, in that when the picture is still we are moved. A large part of this ""movie"" is actually still pictures for us to view and be moved. It is like a short trip to the Rijksmuseum to see the Dutch masters. There is the patron Van Ruijven who is a Frans Hals study. The clouds are clearly van Ruisdael, the crowd scenes evoke Jan Steen, and scene after scene is Rembrandt. The lighting is the sharp contrast of light and dark, generated in domestic scenes by the presence of windows only on the canal side of the row houses. In all, it is a fair introduction to art history of 17th century Dutch painting. Unfortunately, the movie has no coherent plot. Each beautiful still-life, domestic scene, or portrait we are treated to fits into a mosaic that is supposed to tell a story. This technique leaves much to the viewers imagination. Too much. We see the family interactions of Vermeer, daughter, wife, and mother-in-law but the overall meaning is lost. Vermeer appears to be in turn brow-beaten, adored, or ignored by his wife. It could be that all three emotions apply, but no balance between them is shown. We could only guess and create for ourselves which is predominant, which are transitory, which are untrue. The interactions between each of the pairs of persons are equally undefined and vague. There is clearly a sexual tension between Vermeer and Griet, the serving girl, but isn't there always some tension between any man and any woman? (Well, perhaps not.) A most daring moment of the film comes (and quickly goes) when Vermeer nearly -- mind you, nearly -- touches Griet's hand. This is not the stuff of passion as, say, in ""The Postman Always Rings Twice."" The outcome of this tension? Well, you tell me. I didn't see any. The film reminds us of beauty. It is worth seeing as any beautiful picture is worth seeing, moving or not.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
108,psychprofessor,Found it disappointing,6,4 July 2004,"Occasionally I see a movie that successfully captures the book, but this wasn't one of them. Now I realize that movies based on popular novels don't have the time luxury needed to include all the nuances an author has written in, but this one left out some things I considered crucial to the story and telescoped other events to such an extent that the meaning and motivation of the characters was compromised. As just one example of this, the main character, Griet, develops a relationship with a young butcher over a lengthy period of time. Eventually she allows the young man some liberties with her body, but it comes after a lengthy courtship. In the movie, it almost appears that she lets the guy ""go all the way"" on about their second encounter.Also, in the novel, my impression of Griet was that she was intelligent, resourceful, incredibly self-possessed, and somewhat feisty. In the movie, she was portrayed (IMO) as much more passive and more as someone who just reacted to events rather than being more actively involved.And where was Griet's family in the movie? Why was her father blind? Besides herself, who was the other figure in the tile her father gave her?
I won't say the movie was awful; it wasn't. I will say I was quite disappointed in the effort to translate a really interesting novel to the screen.",Girl with a Pearl Earring

I hadn't read the book, but now have no desire to. None of the characters warrant any empathy. Scarlett spends her time wide-eyed and blank faced, displaying as little emotion as possible.

There was some beautiful imagery, and it did give us a glimpse of what life was like in 1665 Holland, but it just wasn't enough to justify the making of this film. It had great actors, but they didn't get to flex their muscles. There was very little acting. This film was built on images. The film seemed a sequence of paintings, beautiful as such, but mute and frozen. No life, no action. I wouldn't think of watching this a second time. I have no idea what type of viewer this would appeal to. I normally like films set in the past, I like romance, adventure, anything historical or biographical.

This film would be a fictional story behind that portrait. BUT WHERE IS THE STORY? The story that we see is slow and meaningless, the characters have no character nor depth, they even look stupid sometimes; we see a love story, but we cannot understand nothing of it (why, when was it born?), and there is nothing more ridiculous than a love affair seen from outside.Exactly, outside, because the film is not capable of bringing the cinephile into the story. He would rather prefer to stay outside, free to switch off the TV or, maybe better, to press the Fast Forward button.This movie was nominated for many important awards, winning none of them.

A pity that the film feels unconvincing and artificial, and it leaves way too many loose ends. Colin Firth as Vermeer is an absolute disaster. He has the same blank, empty but yet incredibly sleazy expression on his face as the gigolos that populate beaches at Mediterranean holiday resorts. The Michael Bolton hairdo doesn't help, either. There's no way I'll believe that this idiot could draw even a stick figure. Scarlett Johanssen is very beautiful, of course, and gives a much better performance than First (not that that's in any way difficult). But for most of the movie, she still has only two expressions on her face: stoned or scared. On the positive side: the cinematography is splendid and, as far as I can tell, life in 17th Century Holland is pretty well portrayed.

'Girl with a Pearl Earring' is a pretty boring affair in a broader view. It starts off slowly, keeps the audience wondering 'Where is the Story?' in the middle, and ends without any conclusion. Much to be blamed is the screenwriter Olivia Hetreed, who has written a rather bland and weak screenplay. However, you cannot take your eyes off of the film, even though the film is dragging at tortoise's speed. Eduardo Serra with his lovely color tones and extra-ordinary lighting has really made this snooze-fest look like a moving painting. It complements to Alexandre Desplat's mesmerizing motifs and themes. Johansson has shown some great acting skills in the film. She hardly delivered any 'winning' dialogue but yet her subtle and soft expressions captures the soul of Griet pretty effectively. Furthermore, she looks like a true beauty in this film. Rest of the cast, most noticeably Colin Firth did a decent job. On technical side, apart from music and cinematography, sets and art direction for this film is commendable. The film, on a visual note, captures the 16th century Holland beautifully.Overall, the film is something which can be remembered for cinematography, but it definitely lacks a strong story.

Griet soon after her arrival in this household is confronted with the private difficulties of the artist and his family. He, however is lacking a Muse which he finds in his new maid that shows an enormous interest and understanding of art and beauty. Beyond a sexual and physical level a passionate relationship between the both of them develops.Although not showing nudity and sex the director, Peter Webber, has created an extremely sensual movie with an unbelievably erotic tension between the main characters.Moreover the images are so brilliant and beautiful that the spectator believes himself in an art gallery looking at paintings by great Flemish masters.A calm film, indeed and thus not recommended to those who like action and many words. Those who admire great acting beyond words that explain everything and to whom passion means more than sex and getting physical should really watch this film.

Namely, there is a richsubtext here about an innocent girl named Griet and herdespoilment, not only by Vermeer (who pierces her ear, so shecan wear the pearl earring of the title), but by his household ofvicious women and the caste system that will forever condemn herto a life of servitude. Consider the scene in which Vermeer'sdaughter, Cornelia, deliberately soils a drying sheet with mud(although it looks like excrement). Consider also the scenes inwhich Griet learns to mix paints, and spreads mounds of brownpaint onto Vermeer's palette. She also ventures into the meatmarket and is surrounded by heaps of freshly killed animals.Even though the film's major characters behave according to themost proper etiquette, there is a psychological violence here thatboth devastates and penetrates Griet.

A great achievement of the film is that it doesn't become a melodrama of a love affair between the master and the maid.

It sparked a lot of renewed curiosity in me, and brought out a new and deeper appreciation of an artist I've long admired.I loved this picture, and so did my husband. I do have one issue with it, however: I think that it was very assumptive to show the Vermeer's as possibly combative and unhappily wed. They did have 11 children, after all... 15, counting the ones that died in infancy. Given the fact that Dutch couples in this time in history were not known for having very large families, it speaks of a union that was very happy indeed. I'm sure that the flirtation on the surface (if I can even call it that) between Griet and Johannes was based in a mutual respect more than a sexual thing. That's my take, anyway. I found Vermeer to be strong, captivating, charming in a serious, dark way, and so intense I couldn't take my eyes off him.The film was in my opinion very true to life regarding the way they did things in the 1600's, from what I've read. It was not an easy life, and they did not glamourize it at all. I was thankful for that. I would much rather see a true historic account when watching a period film, and that is what I got! Perhaps it lent a bit of intrigue to believe that the girl in the painting was the object of Vermeer's obsession. I'll admit it did... but there is not historical proof of any such relationship. I did so enjoy it, though. All of the actors/actresses in this film shined but I thought that Griet's character was especially good and perfectly played by Scarlett Johansson, who I look forward to seeing more of! Ditto for Colin Firth. It excites me to see actors and actresses coming forth lately that I've overlooked. Now I know I'll have to look for them again. I love to find new blood in Hollywood - especially lately when so many of the ""rich, famous and political"" seem intent on spoiling their careers with liberal nonsense. (I don't care about that. Personally, I am fed up with being force fed political propoganda! I just want to see them acting in a good movie!) This time, I certainly did enjoy it in every way! This one definitely earned a 9 out of a possible 10 from me. I have rarely given a 10, if ever... and this one did not disappoint me.

I must say that I am often a fan of films in which very little of any consequence occurs. The previous night, for instance, I had loved every minute of The station Agent. This sort of film however can only work if it manages to engage. And in this The Girl with a Pearl Earring, for all its beautiful costumes and scenery, spectacularly fails. Colin Firth plays the same role we all know by heart, and Scarlet Johansson simply fails to bring any sympathy or life to her character. Tom Wilkinson is as good as ever, but his character is so one dimensional you wonder whether he has simply been copied and pasted from a comic book of villains. I was left rather annoyed by this pointless work.

Given the beautiful lighting by Boyd in""Master and Commander"" and some of the interesting camera use in ""City ofGod,"" it is no small feat for ""Girl with a Pearl Earing"" to outclass its fellow nominees.  The film is so lush and really took me by surprise.   I assume that many of the shots are recreations of paintings from the era (at times I felt as if I were strolling through a gallery), and this aspect only heightens the film as a whole.Everything in this movie works extremely well.  The story, although not speedy in its development, is very well constructed; and, the acting is superb all around (Johannsen is one of the few actresses of her generation that can draw you in just through the emotion expressed in her face).  Colin Firth and Tom Wilkison are both solid in their respective roles, and the other cast members flesh out this wonderful little gem.Yet the strongest aspect of this film is its visual beauty (not that any aspect of this film is not well executed).  This film deserves to win Best Cinematography, but then again, another film with Miss Scarlet lost out its deserved cinematography Oscar (Roger Deakins's wonderful work in ""The Man Who Wasn't There"").  Thecostumes and art direction are also dazzling (not shockingly also recognized in their respective Academy Award categories).  Although I don't think ""Pearl"" has a chance in the latter categories with both ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""The Last Samurai"" nominated in each, hopefully it will take home a statuette forcinematography.Definitely worth checking out in the theatre if you get a chance; otherwise, this is a great movie that should be viewed on The Sundance Channel or DVD if youdon't get a chance to see it in the theatre.",Girl with a Pearl Earring

This is one of those times.  The climax of this film is, undoubtedly, Scarlett Johansson's Griet as a virtual cinematic copy of Vermeer's title painting. She was able to convince me that the story told was true, and that this is how the great painting was produced.  For those who would dub it an ""art movie""-it is.  And, as most of the great art, it's not for you.  Those who love art-come and see... Most other performances, particularly that of Essie Davis as a lewd and crass ""patron of arts"", are worth watching by themselves.  Davis character makes everything that he talks about seem utterly dirty and oozing. And, of course, there is the cinematography, which may have shown us that, while Rembrandt and Vermeer are dead, there are those among us that master light, form, and content as well, or perhaps even better, than they did. My only fear is that cheap imitations may follow.  Already, HBO is running an absolute atrocious set of series about lives and works of great artists (Rembrandt, Goya, Degas, etc.) presented in a light and cheesy manner.  I am hoping that The Big Screen will resist anything of the kind.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
130,WishfulDreamer,Brilliant Introspective Film,10,7 August 2007,"Many have said this movie was tedious, but I found it to be very fascinating. The slowness was intentional and, at many points in the film, the facial expressions of the characters and focusing on objects was much more important than dialogue. The viewer needed to be as introspective as the young Griet (portrayed exceptionally by Scarlett Johanson) and grasp the vital undertones in the film. Colin Firth portrayed the withdrawn Vermeer quite well and Cillian Murphey shone as Pieter, though he was not in the movie too much. The majority of the actors were very strong and convincing- and they added well to the intensity of the movie.To watch this film and understand it, you must do a good bit of thinking because many points are not spoken outright. It is hauntingly beautiful and suspenseful. If you can watch a film such as this that does not involve much action and can handle slow bouts and critical thought, I strongly recommend this film. The emotions are what shine the strongest, as well as the symbolism.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
131,brainyidiot,artfully boring,4,16 June 2005,"I love art and thought this film had some beautiful composition in the camera work.A very nice look and feel for the times too.I also thought Scarlett Johansson was quite lovely in the title role and does share a striking resemblance to the girl in the painting.One problem I had was that the movie is a big snore. I wanted to like it, but the pacing was so slow that I had a hard time staying awake.It did spark in me an interest in Vermeer though. I found a website with examples of his some 35 known works and I can see why he was considered a ""Dutch Master."" The painting ""The Girl with a Pearl Earring"" was posed by a model that is unknown to this very day. Speculation was that she might have been Vermeer's daughter, but his eldest at the time was only 11.In my view, the painting is far more interesting than the movie. Anyone agree?",Girl with a Pearl Earring
132,tramky,Bringing Canvas to Film,8,26 June 2005,"I have admired the paintings of the great master Johannes Vermeer for quite a long time, and it is fairly rare to see the life of an artist portrayed in a motion picture. I was pleased to find this film and viewed it quite recently for the first time.For me this film elevated in virtually all scenes in Vermeer's upstairs studio and in the attic space or wherever it was where he made his paints. Those places in the house were, of course, where the artistry found expression. All the rest of it, the neurotic baby-factory wife, the wise but mercenary mother-in-law, and Vermeer's generous, lecherous patron were somewhat unfortunate aspects of the artist's life, though his was hardly a tragic story.The breathless Griet, first as the maid cleaning the studio then later becoming Johannes' assistant and model, was a wonderful concoction in the book and that fictional character was beautifully rendered in this film. There were several scenes in the studio with Griet which were literally breathtaking in their beauty and stillness. This was only possible because of the production design, costuming, lighting and the luscious Scarlett Johansson who was brilliantly cast in this role as the nubile Dutch maid.There was one other scene in the studio when Griet silently watched Johannes painting another model for another picture. The sheer visual beauty of that scene as the camera moved across the room was simply wonderful; for a moment I wasn't sure what we were seeing.The core of this film was a fictional account of what might have been the case with this famous painting. Whether the truth behind that picture is anything like this seems irrelevant; I can accept this story for what it is and am pleased to have seen this film.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
133,chetley,Beautiful Dutch Still Life with Pearl Performances,8,7 February 2004,"Novels are one medium, painting another, and film yet another.   A novel about a painting made into a movie:  a good example of cross-fertilization in the arts, but also a possible recipe for an undramatic film.    Tracy Chevalier's novel is an imaginative account of what _might_ have inspired one of the Dutch master Vermeer's greatest paintings - but the drama that it contains is as subtle and as restrained as Vermeer's own canvases.   To their credit, the film-makers here have remained faithful to their sources. It's not to say that drama is absent from the film; simply that it is drama that lies more in the repression of words and the absence of action than in any pseudo-glamorous notions of what properly constitutes ""a good story."" That said, I found plenty of passion in this film, the passion of stillness. See this movie for Scarlett Johannson's brilliant turn as the servant girl Griet - what a fine performance it is!   Colin Firth is good too, but it is Johannson who makes this quiet ""art movie"" as stirring in its own way as ""Pollock"".",Girl with a Pearl Earring
134,magicalmouse,Haunting and a Treat for the Eye !,9,1 February 2004,"I enjoyed this film a great deal, having first heard of the book in an NPR interview I was delighted to discover that it was made into a film. The cast is excellent, the story never lags and the cinematography is outstanding. The story itself is haunting and it raises as many questions about the mysterious girl in the picture as it manages to answer so after the closing credits the viewer is left with much to think about and discuss.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
135,cetaylor3,Going for Filmic Gold and Lapis,9,15 December 2003,"Any Vermeer lover must see this movie, unless maybe you wouldn't be interested in what a Vermeer canvas would be like if it could walk and talk and become spectacular before your eyes for feature length. Girl with a Pearl Earring, which gets an 8.5 out of 10 from me (and I'm a tough grader), is an unprecedented filmic experience in completely investing us inside the life of a painting. And it's intriguing that the first such museum-quality painting to inspire the weaving of an entire literary-turned-filmographic story, initially author Tracy Chevalier's, would be a Vermeer and would especially be ""Pearl Earring,"" a painting which -- without spoiling the fairly predictable plot, I'll simply say -- a certain character refers to near the end as being ""obscene.""  Hardly, I dare venture, a term any lover of Vermeer or *any*  modern museumgoer would have produced in any list of adjectives for the work.Indeed, while I'd never for a moment possibly conceived it as such, that comment alone speaks volumes not just about the character who utters the line and her entire psychocultural inner life and the lives around her but also about what this film impacts upon us more broadly - socioculturally -- in two dimensions:  firstly here that of time as culture, just how very remote we are on the surface from the mores of those times-Delft, Holland of 1665.  What the filmmaker, Peter Webber, has accomplished is to make us feel penetrated by the eyes of that painting, to feel both just how utterly the master Vermeer has invested or evoked life and soul in those eyes, but also how precisely such an evocation was, especially for the character who finds it 'obscene' but also for the cultural mores of the era, an obscene enterprise - the very idea that a painter might see and depict such life passion steeped down to one's marrow rendered through the eyes. Tempting to think that whoever first said ""The eyes are the windows of the soul"" was looking at this painting as s/he conceptualized that thought.The second gripping dimension of this film which makes it stand apart from and above even most quality films is its gritty evocation of social class. It's hard to recall a film that more powerfully conveyed economic class socialization and its constraints. And, while the tableaux and panoramas and street life, seen through the eyes of a newly hired maid (and street-market barterer), immerse us in the grit of it, what rivets us to its power and penetrating impact on every fine-motor detail of daily life is the flawless performance of Scarlett Johansson, now two for two lately (Lost in Translation) in batting not just out of the ballpark but into the stratosphere.  At every moment in the film, there is a narrative tension which is precisely a tension of social class that is spoken in her every muscle from face to hands to feet.  She *is* The Girl, exudes her so much so that you might wonder if you've fallen asleep in the museum and the painting itself has taken on a dreamlife. (And, henceforth, she alone will suffice as marquee draw to get me to a movie.)Repeatedly, the lighting and composition of his paintings themselves are captured in Vermeer's studio in almost every move Griet, The Girl, makes as she goes about her raw-fingered chores, not too often to make it cloying but just repeatedly enough to make you feel almost at times ""Well, but of <i>course</i> he painted what he did and so well, it was his entire oxygen, such scenes as he captured were literally walking through and 'posing in' his daily routine!  He would have had to be blind not to have painted what he did!""  And in so doing, Vermeer lent and still lends an elegance to labor, a refined gentility to simplicity and poverty, a wisdom to ingenuity.Friends I saw the movie with had read the book, and while also thoroughly enjoying the film, I could tell there was the usual nostalgia for a book that a film almost never captures. And as they explained, upon request, how the plot of the book continues on beyond where the film ends, collapsing scenes over time to bring the book's ending far forward in the film's plotline, I found myself quite appreciative of the screenwriter's choice. It worked emotively quite powerfully for me that the film ended as it did....And ended in a way which caught me by surprise: Suddenly i found just how much the film had tied me through its lustrous specifics into a palette of universalisms -- about the heart, about human dreams, about justice, about inequity, about treasures and treasuring, about natural mentors opening the eyes of natural students to entire new worlds of understanding, about the power of passions for good and ill, harmony and disharmony, about precisely just how much two spirits can bridge (and yet not bridge) an enormous gulf of separating life circumstances. And, thanks to the film's masterful mixing of these 'colors' of life, all of that was able to culminate in a visual exclamation point without a single word being uttered. It now is all there for me to take away from the film and able forevermore to read and re-read in a canvas. A canvas I thought I already admired but now will never again see without these far-reverberating extra strokes ... much as Griet comes to learn to never again see a cloud as being (simply, erroneously) white.My only recurrent problem was something in Colin Firth's portrayal of Vermeer himself. It was good but not masterful. Periodically i was pulled back from the story and the feelings by a jarring expression or tone of voice which made this Vermeer feel ""in and out."" Mostly ""in"" - in character, in the moment -- but not always. And it stood out because he -- and perhaps Vermeer's mischievous daughter (who was a bit of a throwback to films of prior decades when child actors felt routinely two- or even one-dimensional) -- were the only two for whom that was true at all within a cast of diverse very strong character types (notably the wife, the mother-in-law, and the head of household staff, as well as Tom Wilkinson's choice of a character far afield from his prior work but one he was so buried in I never thought of Tom, the actor, for a moment).These were small blemishes, however, on a filmic canvas which was so rich in such diverse cultural time-specific and also profoundly universal ways that the flaws do pale and dissolve away, leaving only some of the most lasting images and feelings conveyed on film this year.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
136,baileykerr,"Eh... great visuals, bad screenplay",6,20 December 2010,"I gave it a 6 out of 10 mainly because the visuals were beautiful. The costumes were fantastic and, of course, the paintings were phenomenal, and the actors casted were just right for the characters. But the screenplay was very unorganized. The only reason I could completely understand the motives of each character was because I read the book. For example, the book explains that Griet never takes off her bonnet because that would reveal her insecurities. But when Vermeer sees her hair, she unexpectedly feels free to let her guard down, that's why she goes into the alley with Pieter and let's him in physically. The movie did not cover that therefore all the audience got was an necessary love scene. Overall, the screenplay was the only thing that I found awful. Everything else was superb.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
137,ElizabethCoral,Very Good Indeed,10,12 April 2004,"Girl With A Pearl Earring is an excellent film and I am sad that so few people seem to have seen it. Scarlett Johansson is wonderful as Griet, a young girl who has to become a servant in the household of master painter Johannes Vermeer after her father is blinded in an accident.Johansson has only around 59 lines of dialogue in the entire movie...but her emotions are brilliantly conveyed by her eyes and her expressions. And she really does resemble the girl in the real painting. Her growing attraction to Vermeer (a brooding and very attractive Colin Firth) is beautifully handled. The claustrophobic atmosphere and growing air of tension in the Vermeer household is also very well done.I saw this film many times in the cinema and I can't wait for it to come out on DVD. The performances are wonderful and the cinematography is breathtaking...each scene looks like a Vermeer painting. It is so unfortunate that Girl With A Pearl Earring was competing with the equally-magnificent Master and Commander for the Cinematography Oscar...Serra's work here really deserves some recognition...I really felt while watching the film that I had been transported back in time to 17th-century Delft. Desplat's score is beautiful and should have been nominated for (and indeed won) the Best Original Score Oscar...but don't even start me on that one.Overall, Girl With A Pearl Earring is highly recommended!",Girl with a Pearl Earring
138,susy-7,Some random thoughts on the themes of the movie. (spoilers),9,5 February 2004,"Although The Age of Innocence is late 1800s New York and Girl with a Pearl Earring is set in the 17th Century Holland, there is much in these films that are similar and I must say, Girl did much better with the themes than Age did.  Both stories concern the characters' places in society--principally KEEPING those places.  Vermeer and all his household are very aware of how precarious their finances are, and this point is reinforced throughout the film.  Also, although Age's story was a love story, and it is unclear in Girl if this is a love story, there nevertheless exists in both a restrained sexuality and erotic tension.  In fact, I felt that the tension was almost unbearable at times--the lingering camera shots showing the physical reactions of Griet and Vermeer to incidental interactions and especially to the more personal interactions (the piercing) made me feel as if I too had a hard time catching my breath.
The film substitutes many activities for sex and proves again that restraint is startlingly erotic and moving.  This is a luminous, beautifully made and brave film.  I say brave because not often do directors ask their actors to forego dialogue in favor of emoting.  Here the actors' emoting is underplayed, quiet and still.  Without any dialogue telling us, we can see clearly that Vermeer is obsessive. Perhaps he is addicted to his artistry:  while we assume he must find joy in it, it also seems to be tortuous and painful for him and removes him emotionally from his family.  He shares is obsession with Griet; in fact, when she shows an aptitude, he forces her to become more involved.  This too is a theme of Girl: forced servitude (to the point of non-sexual prostitution).  Forced to work as a domestic servant, forced to mix paints, forced to model.  It is interesting too, that Griet's participation in the painting is a conspiracy by her ""betters"" in society who each have their own reasons.  Van Ruijven intends her rape, the mother-in-law intends to keep Vermeer employed and thus keep the household solvent and Vermeer, well, Vermeer intends many things.  Principally, it seems that he is too obsessed to say no.  Also, while not intending a physical violation of Griet in a sexual way, he nevertheless does physically and emotionally violate her. Her quiet compliance in the piercing scene is one of an innocent obeying and trusting.  Vermeer understands this and though torn, he is compelled to go through with it.  He blames Van Ruijven for the modelling, but one can see that he himself looks forward to the interplay.When the wife discovers the deceit, it is interesting that no one points out to her that it is Griet who has saved the family by acquiesing to the demands of the patron.  Though she is deceived, she is also a principle benefactor of Griet's trust and obedience.  After being used for her purpose, she is sent packing.The cinematography, art direction and editing are outstanding, as are the performances of all the actors.  This is a film made by a sure hand, a director who knew the story and was not afraid to let the story unfold in a nuanced, natural way.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
139,rinoa-3,"More than a film, a silent Vermeer painting in itself: defying and overwhelmingly beautiful.",8,7 June 2006,"Despite director of photography Eduardo Serra's firm claims and wishes of the opposite, Girl With A Pearl Earring is a film where each frame leaves the impression of being a fine painting instead. This is not meant in a bad way; on the contrary, the concept of silent and motion over actual words explored in this piece of work goes unbelievably well with the games of color, light and dark played at all times on the fantastic sceneries, which are gorgeous and extremely loyal to the reality that was 17th century Holland.Scarlett Johansson, with her fitting fair and exotic beauty, does an amazing job, mostly based on natural instinct, on her portrayal of young Griet's repressed naive nature as a girl who's trapped in an overwhelming love she can not pursue, while, at the same time, never expansively expressing any feelings of angst or frustration towards this situation: instead, her unique, platonic relationship with Vermeer (pleasantly played in all of his lone wolf nature by legendary, eternal Mr. Darcy, Colin Firth himself) seems to be something she holds dear and sacred above all things; something she does not quite understand in her ignorance, lack of experience and consequent fear, maybe something she doesn't realize the real importance of, but definitely the one thing she has a fullest, most instinctive acceptance of.As for other technical details, while sound is often purposely neglected, the soundtrack itself blends nicely with the rest of the fine artistic feeling about the film, mostly coming out quite fitting, as well as pleasant listening to. The other actors, in general, also manage to give a minimum of substance to their roles in a decently convincing way.It strongly seems to me that the lack of further development of Griet and Vermeer's story is the movie's biggest strength and weakness, all in one. For better understanding of the way things unfold (or don't, as the case may be), while watching this film one must not forget that Girl With A Pearl Earring is based on a fictional romance about the possible story behind one of Vermeer's most famous paintings of the same name; Griet is not a historical figure, neither is the model-painter relationship a fact of the past: not even remotely (on the contrary, all aspects of the real Vermeer's life have been kept in the shade for centuries, and probably always will). Exactly because of this, such bond deserved to be explored and exposed in a way which could help make the girl's pose, look and likeness plausible and explainable, and this didn't imply any kind of explicit physical manifestation of a relationship: one that's not even once admitted to out loud in the film. Due to this, all shallow, pseudo-romantics out there will probably be pretty much disappointed.Girl With A Pearl Earring is a piece of art about as much as the painting it's about, from the photography to the theme. No kiss could ever come close to the intensity and power Johansson and Firth manage to bring into, for instance, the ear piercing scene (the silent, the contact, the painful moan, the single tear down Griet's face), and the fact that it's up to the viewer to put all the unspoken puzzle pieces together and feel (or imagine) what could have been, instead of what actually was, is exactly what makes this film, the supposed model-artist bond and the painting itself all so beautiful, challenging and intriguing. For something more concrete and physical, we must content ourselves with the actual relationship gradually established between Pieter's character and Griet, as she, herself, did, giving out the impression that while it is Vermeer that she's hopelessly involved with in higher levels than one could imagine, it is to Pieter that she must go to in order to vindicate her feelings: Griet's natural acceptance of the multiple impossibilities with Vermeer, as well as of the different roles the two men play in her life, comes off as total and instinctive.No matter what might or might not be said about it, Girl With A Pearl Earring remains a film about an unspoken, extremely unlikely bond stronger than any other, one that goes against all age and class barriers and that we must discover and put together ourselves: a challenge to our own creativity and interpretation skills. In two words, defying and beautiful, not at all to be watched by close-minded, less patient people who value certain manifestations above the often more meaningful lack thereof: for those, it might become boring, dark and empty after the first ten minutes. Otherwise, it's a very human masterpiece, and, more importantly, a work of art and passion.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
140,hundredacrefilms,Who's That Girl? by Thomas J. O'Connor,5,20 December 2005,"As with Da Vinci's 'Mona Lisa,' 17th century Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer's 'Girl With a Pearl Earring' is a masterpiece that has inspired many an inquiring mind to ruminate as to whom the subject was in relation to the artist. It was novelist Tracy Chevalier's own curiosity that inspired the authoring of her world-wide best selling novel of the same name. Now, in the hands of filmmakers we find out that the 'Girl' is actually Scarlett Johannson (Lost in Translation, Ghost World). Seriously though, Johannson bears a stunning likeness to the painting, an illusion held beautifully until Vermeer's actual painting is presented just before the credits roll. In her younger day's, Shelly Duvall would have been the spitting image.Thankfully, Ms. Johannson is more than just the face to match the painting; she is an actress who is growing in greatness with each new role she takes on. As Greit, THE Girl with the pearl earring she says, ""The raw emotion of a girl who is in love and not able to express it is universal, because very often you can't have what you love."" This isn't just a chick flick, our man Vermeer is equally repressed and painting is his outlet for exorcising his unrealized inner desires. At its core, this is a story about repression giving birth to something greater.If a visit to an art museum leaves you feeling bored rather than appreciative, than this may not be a movie for you. The pace is as leisurely as any true lover of art would take in surveying the framed canvasses hung in the hallowed halls of a great gallery. First time feature film director Peter Weber is in the company of many accomplished artisans. Together cast and crew bring forth the virtues of Vermeer's skillful work, largely revered for its stunning study of the play of light on the subjects he chose. Kudos to cinematographer Eduardo Serra who used different film stocks to juxtapose the atmospheres between the household space and the ""sacred"" upstairs studio space Vermeer worked in.In the end, there's nothing particularly powerful about the movie's 99 minutes, save for its overall beauty. Which quite possibly will linger in your head much the same way Vermeer's work has for so many down through the ages.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
141,C2FThom,Waste of a terrific cast,4,15 June 2005,"""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" isn't your typical character drama or period piece (except for the fact that these Dutch people speak British English). Rather, it's quite simply a ""slice of life"" film, a voyeuristic endeavor that relies upon contextual clues and on the nuances of the actors' performances to succeed.Unfortunately, this portrait of 17th century Holland is so restrained and conservative, the notable cast has very little opportunity to shine. In fact, the only thing I took from the film WAS the fact that this particular society was extremely conservative, and that it took very little at all to rock the proverbial boat--a married man, alone in a room with another woman, god forbid painting her, was practically considered adultery. Colin Firth was completely wasted here, and Scarlett Johansson gave a much better turn in 2003--a superbly ""nuanced"" performance--in Lost in Translation. Tom Wilkinson plays the scheming art patron/benefactor, the only enjoyable and unpredictable part in the bunch.BTW, the film does *look* spectacular. Nearly any scene could be worthy of a masterful painting itself.

I'm a 38 year old gal and that's the word I have to use for him; he is much more attractive with longer hair. Scarlett Johansson does a very riveting performance of the maid. She is sweet but sensual. You can definitely tell why Vermeer found her intriguing. Everything I have ever seen Tom Wilkinson in, he always impresses me, truly an exceptional thespian.

I'd recommend this movie to people who are patient enough and mature enough to let it play itself out. I really liked this movie. After seeing Lost in Translation I have grown very fond of Scarlett Johannsen (sorry if I spelled her name wrong) and was not let down in the least with her performance.With all the chaos and drama that supposedly surrounded this film behind the scenes,I must say they pulled it off. In my heart I believe this second string of cast members did a justice for the movie that the first choice actors couldn't have touched.I give it a 7 out of 10.

146,rbischoff,Exquisitely matches the book in look and tone,9,4 February 2004,"A cinematic masterpiece. For art direction and cinematography, GWAPE easily ranks among the top ten films of the thousands I have seen. It is comparable to the Godfather epic and Lawrence of Arabia in that regard. Dozens of scenes are worthy of framing and mounting in galleries--they are that exquisite.Regarding performances, I can now see why there is such a buzz about Scarlett. That so young an actress can carry a film in which there is so little dialogue and in which, as the lead, she appears in nearly every shot gives you some idea of her level of acting skill. Could she be our next Meryl Streep? All in all, the casting is pretty much spot on, but Judy Parfitt as the Matron does especially fine work.Girl With a Pearl Earring deserves to be widely seen and to be much awarded, but it may struggle in both areas. It may be too ""quiet"" to appeal to broad tastes. In this I would liken it to ""sex, lies and videotape"", which has a similar aesthetic tension. It also has the misfortune of debuting in 2003, the year in which the academy will award Peter Jackson for his (highly deserved!) work on the LOTR trilogy. If you even remotely enjoy any of the fine arts I can highly recommend that you see this film. But I also strongly recommend that you Tracy Chevalier's book first. My spouse's viewing experience was somewhat lessened because she was expecting a more direct, less subtle storyline. The hallmark of Chevalier's work is her brooding atmosphere, in which each visual and aural element contributes meticulously and subtly to the overall effect. The author (and the film director) both master this technique, ultimately emulating the method and mood of Vermeer's paintings with outstanding success. I applaud their achievements.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
147,theachilles,"Vermeer, his servant and a painting",7,29 November 2004,"In Holland of 17th century, a humble girl named Griet (Scarlett Johanson) works as a maid in the house of the famous painter Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth) and somehow contributes into the creation of a masterpiece.The film, just like Tracy Chevalier's book on which is based, narrates an imaginary story about who and what inspired Vermeer and led him make the ""Girl With A Pearl Earring"" painting. Few things are known about the personal life of Vermeer. He died at 43 after making 35 paintings and having 11 children. More than any other of the Dutch painters, he analyzed the effect natural light had on a room and on a face, something that influenced visually the film as well. It seems inevitable that the first thing everybody notices about this film is the stunning work done by the director of photography Eduardo Serra (ASC, AFC). The colors, the lightning, the surrounding environments create a harmony and every frame of the movie cries out for you to watch it and admire it. According to the cinematographer, he didn't want the film look like a collection of Vermeer's paintings because something like that could possibly distract the viewers from the story. Well, unfortunately for him (but not for our eyes), he didn't manage it.Although there are very few dialogues, the script achieves to be multi-leveled. Initially, it can be seen as a commentary on artistic inspiration. But there's much more in it. Griet intrudes into Vermeer's universe. She is the catalyst that makes things upside down in the household, in a very silent way - much unlike the lead character in Pier Paolo Pasolini's ""THEOREM"" (1968). Griet has an inner energy that captivates the painter. She doesn't end up to be just a model for him, she becomes something more. The relationship between the artist and his subject becomes deeper and deeper as Vermeer gets obsessed with his servant. Obsession plays a very important role in the story. Let's not forget that Vermeer lived in a household full of women and the only way to concentrate on his art was by having carved out his very personal space in the house. Neither his wife, nor his mother in law or his children were qualified to enter there. But Griet manages it and there are many scenes that prove her understanding of Vermeer's art.While most films should have a tighter job in editing, this one has the exact opposite problem. Its small duration may make it watchable, but the characters seem to suffocate. They could be far more developed, but the lost ground is covered by the liaisons created among them. Griet is totally charmed by her master. She admires him as a personality, as an artist and of course as a man. But not even a moment does she forget her background and probably she ends up with Peter, the butcher's son who from the very first moments showed his feelings about her - a rather perfect match. Vermeer's thoughts are more complexed. He somehow also admires Griet, mainly because of her esteem on art. But his obsession with her is not based on erotic or sexual grounds. We can see that he's loyal to his wife, but he just does what he has to do in order to serve his art. On the other hand, Van Ruijven, who is Vermeer's family's patron is presented as a rich and lecherous old man. He knows Vermeer's desperation for money and tries to take advantage of the growing intimacy between the master and the maid that seems obvious to him. Last but not least, it must be said that in Vermeer's house, light is a character of itself. It becomes brighter and more colorful as Griet evolves from a maid to his model.There is a strange chemistry between the lead actors, but not very successful. Firth is undoubtedly a limited actor and although he tries his best, it is not enough for such a challenging role. Johanson is surely more talented and her body language and face expressions are captivating. However, many times in the film we have the sense that she repeats her performance in ""LOST IN TRANSLATION"", especially in scenes where not too much is shown, but many are implied. So, the room is empty for Judy PArfitt to make another excellent performance and build in a great way her character. Peter Webber is just another director and here he's doing a better job than usually, mostly because of the materials he had in his hands. You can't distinct the director's personal touch throughout the film and that's not a good sign. My Grade: 6.5 out of 10",Girl with a Pearl Earring
148,katherinewithak,Horribly Boring (Possible minor spoiler?),2,25 May 2005,"This must be one of the most boring, pointless, and questionable movies I've ever seen. Though the actors were all competent in their parts, the movie plodded along with little plot and a ""wading through quicksand"" pace. The viewer finds himself hanging onto the thin rope that keeps him attached to the movie from start to finish if for no other reason than to see if a plot actually ever develops or if a romantic/erotic relationship eventually develops between Vermeer and Griet--one that goes beyond the mere (accidental) touching of their hands during a painting session or his staring salaciously at her mouth while instructing her to moisten her lips. While the desire can clearly be felt from the man toward the girl in his looks and stance alone, the movie delivers the sexual energy and appeal that one would expect to behold in the open marketplace of sixteenth century England: absolutely none. Its provocative innuendos are reminiscent of those contained in medieval prose--so subdued and ""inert"" that they hardly qualify as provocative in our world--which leaves this movie equally disenchanting and lacking. The subtle undercurrents and ""alluring"" innuendos serve, then, as little more than farcical entertainment and I likewise found myself constantly critiquing it's silliness. Perfect for 85 year old prudes who've never entered the world of romance or twelve year old girls who delightfully fantasize what marriage may be like. As far as the Interest Factor, one could basically fall asleep after the first 15 minutes, wake up 5 or 10 minutes before the end, and essentially not miss anything in between--oh, except the stable scene. Certainly not worth a monetary investment.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
149,davidg2e,A visual tour de force,10,24 January 2005,"Rarely does a movie come along that is flawlessly photographed. Even more rare is one that is both that sensitively directed. ""Girl"" does just that. Every frame is reminiscent of a Vermeer. They are luminous, even when ""dark"" scenes. I didn't want the picture to proceed because I didn't want to lose the image before my eyes!I have not read the book so I cannot comment on how faithful the movie was to the text but I did have the nagging suspicion that something was missing and so am not interested in the book. In fact, my friends and I marveled that the story could be so well told with such a spare script. Casting was another triumph. Colin Firth projects gloom in a superbly sexual way and Scarlet Johanneson a vulnerable ingenuousness. Even the secondary characters were perfect. The best recommendation I can give is that I am looking forward to watching it again...and again.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
150,joesnuff,Dancing around the Girl's Pearl,7,21 June 2005,"Vermeer himself was the least interesting character. Too often in films about artists or other obsessive types of craftsman, the assumption is that it is good enough to simply portray their bare obsessiveness and idiosyncrasies and think we are then accepting the genius of this person's craft. But I think that's only one aspect of the top psychological layer, it doesn't really draw me into the artist's eye.The story itself (fiction as it was) was only mildly interesting. However, for me, a mediocre story doesn't necessarily mean a mediocre film. I don't mean the story was bad, only that it is familiar territory for us if we've seen period dramas - i.e., an outsider stepping into an already unstable family situation, unintentionally inflaming already strained relationships. It was done well, but nothing new.But that's OK because in this case I feel the story wasn't the main point, it was about the nature of art in its illumination of characters (both literally and figuratively). The drama was just a foil to carry the themes that can't be put into words (or words would ruin it).Then, there's much good to say about the thematic undercurrents (subtext or whatever) which frequently ripples to the surface. These filmmakers were basically reading back into history (or, creating history and environment around a figure whose background is literally dark and void) their modern psychological stance on the way an artist's creativity and an artist's so-called sexual being can parallel and intertwine, and so on.I recall the attempted rape scene of the girl by Vermeer's patron. It begins outside as a chase among the clean hanging sheets (blank canvases?), its purity is tainted by muddied hands, and so also goes the tainting of the model for the commissioned work. A family member coldly watches this wicked act from the inside, watching through the distortions of thick window glass. This distorted view of the girl was later redeemed by the illumined view offered in the Vermeer painting, a symbolic gesture of restoring her purity. The girl being affectionately represented on to a Dutch master's easel would allow her inward image to shine, it would be validation of her humanity despite everything else.With a modern fiction being implanted back into a historical riddle, they attempt to answer the questions regarding this particular work of art: What do we do and what can we know when only the face is illumined, with only a stark pearl ornament shimmering from (presumably) window light? No environment, no background, no status, no known connection to the world around her. Just darkness and void.That's why the film ends with the zoom *out* from the earring of the actual painting, out to the whole picture, because this is a symmetrical finish to the rest of the film which had started with the background and methodically zoomed into the earring itself. Now at the end, the dark background is no longer void, it is filled with life and pain and love and survival and disappointments and so on. The seeing-eye of a mystery in art expands; a pupil dilates. Good job on their part.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
151,dave-bell45,The most beautiful film of the year,9,10 February 2004,"After reading somewhat mixed reviews - slow - very little plot - I was a little apprehensive, particularly as it was only days after being totally underwhelmed by ""Big Fish"". I was wholly unprepared to be knocked back in my seat by the sheer beauty of this film. The sets, lighting and camerawork had me gripped right from the start, and it is true to say that I had quickly made up my mind that this was a uniquely impressive film. True, there is nothing particulary clever or elaborate about the plot; however I can only say I was never remotely bored. Time after time, a simply shot scene in the studio or kitchen would be followed by a mind-blowing vista of the wintry countryside, or the delicately picked-out colours of the buildings in Delft overlooking the canal. Even towards the end, the camera moves, after lingering over Tom Wilkinson surveying his painting, to Greit's home, where she is shown framed in a doorway in a masterpiece of a set, where again the shades of colour take your breath away. The characterisation is superb, and the cast are all good, but yes, Scarlett Johansson has a certain presence, which leaves me thinking she is going to be a big star. It cannot be easy for someone so young to act in such a slow- burning drama, conveying meaning with subtle glances or gentle use of eye-brows. My advice would be that if you are impressed by paintings, treat this as an ""Old Master"" rather than a film, and just gaze at it for the duration.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
152,Taurus-Littrow,Eye Candy,9,15 April 2005,"Other reviewers have commented on the visual impact of this film. As admirers of Vermeer's work, both my wife and I were in visual heaven throughout. As for the other aspects of the film, we were both reminded of the sexual tension of another great, understated film, ""Remains of the Day"". We had seen ""Lost in Translation"" and were not impressed with either the film or Johansson's work in it. Consequently, her efforts in ""Pearl Earring"" came as a very pleasant surprise. Colin Firth, as always, was excellent.For us to give 10 out of 10, a film has to grab us emotionally, to cause a catch in the throat or the start of a tear.

154,katsat,Subtlety and smoldering in an art movie,10,4 November 2003,"Girl with a Pearl Earring successfully captures the essence of it source novel. In both its visual beauty and rendering of each character, the movie transports you to the 17th century Dutch world of Vermeer and a society of sexual repression and the power and powerlessness of money and class.Very subtle and stylistic, GWAPE has very little action and dialog, but with emotions seething just below the surface. Eduardo Serra's cinematography is breath-taking - a Dutch Master painting brought to life.Colin Firth's Vermeer is very virile and forceful, sexy and smoldering, but different from the actor's Pride and Prejudice Darcyesque characters. This Vermeer is a more self-centered and manipulative - an artist for whom his art comes first. His palpable attraction to Griet the servant girl is as important to him for his artistic inspiration as for his libido.With almost no physical contact, the chemistry between the two is amazing. The sexiest scene by far is when he sees Griet in an unguarded moment. His look is hot enough to burn holes in plaster.Although his presence drives the film, Colin is clearly a supporting actor to Scarlett Johansson as Griet, who delivers a performance of amazing maturity and depth. Having to operate on the suppressed level required of a maid in a subservient position, she manages to convey such an astonishing range of emotions with no big tantrums or ""money"" scenes. She is believable and touching and sympathetic throughout, and very beautiful in a nontraditional way.This is clearly an art film, both literally and figuratively, and thus has no chance of being a blockbuster hit. It is slow-paced and character-, not action- driven. It seemed longer than its 99 minutes, but only because every look, every gesture, every setting is significant and requires the full attention of the viewer. First-time director Peter Webber has created a movie of astonishing beauty, but a movie for those moviegoers with the sensibility and willingness to experience it at its own pace.",Girl with a Pearl Earring

I think having read the book prior to seeing the movie spoiled it for me. There were so many touching parts of the book, which were omitted and I think vital to understanding the main characters and the time period. This movie needed much more character development to gain my attention. Other than the beautiful costumes and scenery, I was quite bored. I normally like Johansson as an actress, but found her quite annoying in this movie. Griet was portrayed to be too insipid. Who wants to watch an insipid main character for 2 hours? Also, annoying were the multiple accents in the movie. This movie needed a lot more consistency. I feel this was a poor adaption of the book.

157,justjerel,I'd rather watch paint dry. . .,6,2 September 2004,"The only aspect of this film that I enjoyed was the set design and costuming, which were very stunning. There is essentially no story or plot development to draw you into this film, and when that happens one hopes for at least interesting characters to salvage it on some level.  But, that is not the case here.  None of the characters are ever truly developed, nor are any of them even likable.  I have seen many films where Firth, Johansson, and Wilkinson were spectacular, but in this film none of them measure up to star billing in any way.  I realize that they can only work with the script and characterization given to them.  Some of the scenarios are almost laughable at times, such as the women in the household of Vermeer (Firth), the artist, treating the idea of his doing a portrait of Griet(Johansson)as if it were pornography.  **SPOILER** ahead:  Vermeer and Griet never even get to first base, so it continues the unconsummated relationship theme that Johansson began in ""Lost in Translation.""  I did enjoy the Delft ""blue"" that was depicted throughout the movie, even though it was filmed in Luxembourg and Venice.  I will say this for Johansson, she does make up for the very weak dialogue of her character with a wide range of facial emoting which is overdone at times.  In summation, I found this film to be very boring, and the stunning set design could not salvage it beyond a 5/10 on my scale.",Girl with a Pearl Earring

I felt that I was literally placed in the Flemish landscape, and I could feel the winter on the lake and everything was filmed beautifully.  There wasn't much dialogue, or much complication, but the artistic value was incredible, and that alone made it a great movie.  Scarlett, although having little to say, gave a great performance through her eyes, and a great performance through her modesty, and her speech about the clouds, which I could sense as such a wonderful artistic endeavor.  The elegance of the film was extraordinary too.  I loved it.  Plus, the direction came across as subtle and beautiful. I'm definitely looking forward to what he does in the future.  I'll also be sure to get the movie when it comes out on video.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
159,niggbrotha,thoroughly exemplary movie,10,13 January 2007,"Even though the story behind is largely fictional and the identity of the girl will always remain a mystery, it manages to resurrect not just Vermeer himself, but the very society in which he lived.One of Netherlands' greatest Baroque painters, Vermeer was also a relatively moral bourgeois, concerned by his spiritual well being. This is pinpointed in the movie by his ultimate refusal to cave into a relationship with the servant girl. He ultimately stays behind his aging wife, his spoiled children and his untainted social status. Moreover, he actually diverts his feelings into an artistic direction.No matter how the real story was like, the painting itself is a flawless masterpiece, making good usage of camera obscura and color nuances. I find it totally unbelievable the idea his daughter served him as a model. There is no physical resemblance between father and daughter and the ""obscene"" attitude of the girl (signifying innocence on the brink of vice) would be hardly reconcilable with a father's image of his own daughter.There is no point to spoil the whole plot. Suffice to say it holds together fine and remains thoroughly believable. Acting is not just good, it is outright masterful. Scarlet Johanson's portrait of the girl is an work of art by itself. She plays hers role with such utter conviction and splendor, it left me deeply moved. Everyone is left to admire the quiet strength of character that emanates behind an illiterate servant girl's unspoiled physique. She is beautifully contrasted with the wife, where power is only external (in status and possessions such as jewelry), while the one beneath is a scared aging woman afraid she'll never going to exert the same influence she had onto the painter when she was younger. But the movie remains true to the age and there are no saints or villains in the story. One finds compassion even for the wife, whose attempts towards physical contact are met with indifference by hers husband.Instead of being just a love story, this movie concentrates upon the emotional torment behind the act of artistic creation. The legacy of Flemish school will always be mankind's greatest artistic achievement into the art of painting. Its overall high level of quality and unmatched power of creativity could simply no longer be sustained by future generations of painters, who had no option but being parts of a slow decline process. Comparing Vermeer to Picasso, one can only deplore how much our art has degraded (if present at all among modern ""artists"").Just as Pilate of Pontus once argued, I found no flaw in this beautiful movie. It is heartfully recommended to parents and children alike as a healthy alternative to the bleak output of our movie industry.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
160,lase-protect,Visually Captivating,9,19 August 2011,"On first view 94/100.I usually avoid anything with Scarlet Johansen (sp?). I find her to choose some very poor films with which to be a part of, but I'm glad I gave this 5 minutes. I'm sure it's the only film in which she top-bills that I've watched completely.Very authentic. Britain really does produce some fantastic period dramas. I'm a great fan of John Hawksworth's Sherlock Holmes with Jeremy Brett for it's depth, length and authenticity (bearing in mind however that it was produced for television), 'The Girl With A Pearl Ear-Ring' is probably more believable.The director has done a superb job of capturing the constant underlying class taboo that was prevalent in an environment where servants were employed, and the story was portrayed brilliantly by a wealth of superb actors. John Wilkinson for instance I become more fond of each time I come across him, a masterful portrayal in this as always frankly. Really nobody lets any scenes down at all in this film. Also noticed some well placed lesser known actors and actresses from other works, all of whom were a welcome choice.Camera work is excellent. Initially I was put off by some of the slightly altered contrast levels during some shots but on hindsight these add to the cold winter ambiance it's all lovely. The house is shot in such a way that release from the confines of it's walls into the outside world is rare, adding to the claustrophobic nature of both the lives of the characters, the environment in which they live and work and the uncomfortable situation gradually unfolding for each of them. The complicated political circumstances surrounding what today, looking through the eyes of a 20th century mind-set people might perceive as simply a painting unravelled, was a delightful backdrop. Scoring is sparse which always meets with approval, but exactly the right level of mood enhancement at predictable but understandably key moments. Costume and sets are stunning.A very, very good, well crafted film, and welcomed addition to this library.Lase.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
161,red_hallow,Scarlett Johansson: hidden gem,9,18 December 2003,"The hook of Girl with a Pearl Earring is supposed to be its story, an exercise in historic romantic fiction that fills one of the many gaps in the life of a famous painter. Reportedly, not much is known about 17th century Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer (played here by Colin Firth) outside of recorded factual data, leaving the inspirations of his work open to a fair amount of conjecture. Thus, room was available for author Tracy Chevalier to create a melodrama to whimsically explain the motivation behind Vermeer's famous enigmatic work, ""Girl with a Pearl Earring.""As it turns out, the story is the least interesting element of this gorgeous film. Girl with a Pearl Earring is like a painting come to life. Every shot is masterfully assembled by cinematographer Eduardo Serra and director Peter Webber. The scenes are rich in color, filtered or lit beautifully, with attention to composition. The whole thing looks exquisite.
Watching the movie is like walking through a gallery. The film moves at a slow, leisurely pace, accompanied by memorable string soundtrack. Viewers are allowed to take their time savoring the scenery. The mood of the story is quiet and subtle. The experience is similar to listening to good classical music -- not flashy and showy to capture the short attention spans of today's audience, but confident in unfolding at a pace which allows one to soak in the good qualities.The centerpiece of the movie is Scarlett Johansson, who plays the subject of the titular painting. Between this and Lost in Translation, Johansson's having a good year, and people will likely want to talk up her performance in this movie. Yet the role doesn't offer her much variety in a traditional acting sense -- she has about 20 scenes in which her character, a maid, is working and gets interrupted by one of the house's masters, at which point she looks up, gets nervous, looks down, looks back up, looks back down, does a quick curtsy, looks back up, etc. However, it does allow her to shine as the visual focus of the movie. One might not have been able to choose a face more elegant than Johansson's -- various lighting harmonizes with her smooth features, and her large eyes and full lips are expressive throughout. What her character lacks in action she makes up for in the skillful use of her countenance, able to communicate inner feelings better than any dialogue. It fits in with the film's notion that hers is a visage worth capturing for Vermeer, as it is Johansson who becomes the subject of most of the movie's own ""paintings.""Is it enough to recommend a movie mainly on its looks? I'd say it is -- personally, I was happy enough just using my eyes that I ended up not really caring where the plot was going. But for those who want to pay more attention to that, a rather standard drama about the relational power struggles centered around a scorned potential romance is waiting. We have a jealous wife, a troublemaking kid, a slimy patron, a string-pulling mother-in-law, and the artist who finds an unsuspecting muse in his maid. This is the kind of stuff that could froth up a soap opera, but here it's played more as brooding. It's pretty creative and entertaining enough, but I found it better to be distracted by the scenery.Now I wish I had some expertise in the art of history's famous painters. I admit I can't make an educated comment about how the fabulous photography of the movie relates to actual works by Vermeer or his peers. All I know is I watched a film of visual sumptuousness, and that it makes an argument for the appreciation of the beauty and mystery that can be captured in a well-composed painting.9 out of 10",Girl with a Pearl Earring

In a rather impoverished country, having an artist already recognized as a master and getting paid for his work, would probably make any spouse content.

It has proper amounts of tenderness, of sexual tension, of innocence and ingenuity...The famous scene when he pierces her ear to place the earring for painting is so beautiful, so tensed...live it to the max, it'll leave you almost breathless, probably with tears in your eyes...it's how it left me...easy to understand why. And although it may be stated that ""girls get emotional when confronted with reminiscences of their first love"", which is true, I've seen many guys getting emotional as well, when they saw this scene. It's so beautiful how he tries not to hurt her when putting the earring on, that you forgive him for the weakness in front of his wife, when she shuts her off and tells her to go away. After all, he's an artist. Maybe a more direct contact between them would have been appropriate. I don't agree. The tension is there, without any contact, and whatever it is it's bonding them, it doesn't need a material expression. It's above all that. It's perfect, the way it is. A true masterpiece.

165,confusedcat_05,Pure Aesthetics,9,14 March 2006,"This kind of artistic role/style fits Colin very well. Colin as Vermeer doesn't talk too much in the movie as the leading character, but the talent, struggle, repression, and desire make him very attractive. Scarlett Johanna wasn't my cup of tea. She in 'lost in translation' didn't impress me, rather plain. But her plainness fits interestingly well in this movie as a maid and I like it.It's sad if a couple can't inspire each other, and it's even sadder if they don't understand each other, like Vermeer and Catharina. I don't think the emotion between Vermeer and Griet made them lovers. It's just that Griet inspired Vermeer and Vermeer won Griet's worship that is quite common in young girls. Catharina's jealousness was rooted more on her being ignored as the object and reviewer of Vermeer's painting, in her opinion she was entitled to without doubt, than suspecting an affair.I also feel, what an important role the music played in this movie! Without music, many painting-like scenes will be half empty. I especially like the scene where Griet woke up in the attic and mixed colors for her master. The room was bright and spacious, implying hope with freshness and sweetness and the music matched well.The only wonder I have is why Vermeer's daughter Cornelia hated Griet so much from the beginning.

166,ouais81,Very well done adaptation,10,27 December 2003,"Despite what others may think regarding the supposed lack of depth towards the Johannes Vermeer, Girl with a Pearl Earring is an excellent adaptation of Tracy Chevalier's novel. As it was previously criticized for not containing enough of the artist's soul, Firth's Vermeer was right on the money as the artist whose work was brilliant, but held within a false reality created by the master himself. Johansson's Griet fits perfectly here, as she is taken in by the illusion of the artist and of his paintings. The cast fit perfectly with Chevalier's novel, especially the sneaky, snotty-nosed daughter who constantly meddles in Griet's life. In light of this, Girl with a Pearl Earring was not supposed to be a film which depicted the soul of an artist, but rather the story of a painting. This adaptation was enjoyable and stayed true to Chevalier's story.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
167,mstep-4,Masterpiece for educated viewers!,9,25 April 2010,"Reading through many comments here, I see only warnings to all film producers: don't do artistic films like that! This posting, is to encourage such kind of films.I don't know, where to start, to prize the qualities of this film! This is the most wonderful film, which I saw for years.First of all: On this board many people complained about the acting. For me the performance of Scarlett Johansson (as Griet) was just breathtaking. I never saw an actress playing so deeply and true speechless shyness, fright, uncertainty and submission. But same time she shows intelligence, although if she plays an illiterate girl.This film reflects paintings. That means, the characters are static and have not to be developed, as many are claiming here. The other side of this film in painting style is the symbolic of the scenery: An apple in Vermeers paintings is sufficient, to evoke for the educated people of this time (early baroque era), the whole story of Adam and Eve, sin and cognition. A lady sitting at a spinet, with other words a ""virginal"", was a symbol for chastity, only because of the second name of this instrument. If you don't understand the iconography of the Netherlands painting school, don't watch this film and bother this board with: ""I am so bored!"" or ""the pace of this film is so slow!"" If you never felt tears coming into your ears, watching old masters in an art gallery, this is not your film either. In this film are plenty of symbolic hints and allusions. The characters, static as they are, are sufficient, to build up slowly an erotic tension between the model and the painter, and to the other side jealousy to the family Vermeer.The most moving moment of this film was for me the following scene: finally the painter succeeded to convince his model, of putting on the pearl earring for the portrait. This earring is a symbol of wealthiness and noblesse, which are not due to a maid. The turban was fashion in these times, remembering the battles against the Turkish armies. The painter has to pierce a hole. This scene is a symbolic defloration. He pierces, she is bleeding, and than he is putting the pearl earring in the new hole. We see the face of Griet and a tear drop is running down her cheek. Thank you, Scarlett for this great moment! So moving, so tender, so sad! There are plenty of details, you would never see in a historic Hollywood film: the weals of Griet, her hands are worn up, from her daily labour. The marks on her neck, after the patron tried to violate her. The dirt on the market, on the clothes. The clothes are hand- woven, hand-sewed, hand-washed, I bet with everybody here. I never saw such a detailed staging. Vermeer was famous for his genre paintings, which is reflected in this film: we see the maid washing, preparing dinner, cleaning the steps of the door, merging colours for the master ... One detail again: the season is changing from winter to spring. I rarely saw a film, where you really see the breath in the cold air from all actors! Nevertheless the whole film is only a fictional story, that means a ""historic fiction"", how this painting of Vermeer could have been created. But for me very credible and inspiring.Only thing, I would expect from a ""historic"" film: historic music! Unfortunately the film music is modern and romanticising. I am dreaming of a historic film with real dialects of the epoch and film music of the epoch. Is there not enough fascinating music in these times? Contemporary composers from Jan Vermeer (1632-1675) are for example: Jan Pieterszoon Sweelinck: 1562-1621, Joachim van den Hove: 1567-1620, Claudio Monteverdi: 1567- 1643, Heinrich Schütz: 1585-1672, Girolamo Frescobaldi: 1583-1643, Constantijn Huygens: 1596-1687, Carel Hacquart: 1640-1701, Jacob van Eyck: 1590-1657, Jan Baptist Verrijt: 1600-1650, Jean-Baptiste Lully: 1632-1687, Dietrich Buxtehude: 1637-1707, David Petersen: 1650-1737, Arcangelo Corelli: 1653-1713, Henry Purcell: 1659-1695.The film music of Alexandre Desplat is not bad, I don't want to be mistaken, but it is like ketchup on a steamed whitefish. Only two films are coming into my mind, where the music is historic (both music films) : ""Tous les matins du monde"", (Alain Corneau, 1991) and ""Farinelli"", (Gérard Corbiau, 1994). About the historic language two films again: ""The Passion of the Christ"", (Mel Gibson, 2004 - don't know this film, but Jesus is said to speaking Aramaic), ""Apocalypto"", (Mel Gibson, 2006). When producers and directors will have the courage, to really make an ""Elizabeth I"" in historical language and with historical music? The answer is here on this board: ""I am so bored!"", ""This film is too difficult!""",Girl with a Pearl Earring
168,jstream1000,It could have been better.,5,7 March 2005,"The actress who played Griet was the best part. I didn't like how they portrayed the artist Johannes Vermeer. The way he looked at Griet was kind of perverted. She was just a little kid. Hollywood and the film industry tends to think everyone was and is sex crazed just like they are. The setting was good as were the costumes. Remember people, the story is completely fictitious. To this day no one knows who the girl with the pearl earing really was. It could have been his daughter for all we know. I liked the way they showed how paints were made back in that day. I thought that was a pretty good touch. And how optics were used for making even better portraits. But I'm not real happy with how the artist was portrayed. But the scenes portraying seventeenth Holland were really good. I think that's one of the major appeals of the film.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
169,malarea3,it is as i have never watched it...it didn't end up any where...,5,7 April 2010,"Τhe truth is that every single time i watch a movie i read a couple of the summaries here..I must confess that i was really excited about this film at the begging.. So,as i've seen the first 25 minutes,i was quite sure that this movie had many things to give in the next scenes..I waited patiently..But how wrong was i?Without trying to be absolute or anything i believe that this film is boring.I must admit that there was a mysterious thing throughout the film that always kept me waiting and wanting for more.It didn't make sense in the end..So it's either i had not paid that much attention or it's actually misleading!The one thing i can say with certainty is that it finished just like it started,very suddenly..not leading anywhere..nothing has gone any further,neither the plot,nor the general idea..Everything stays the same.It's still a nice film though,i liked the acting of both Colin Firth and Scarlett Johansson as well as the score.Maybe you'll just have to watch it yourself and discover its own ""PEARL"" :)",Girl with a Pearl Earring
170,dmy9999,I have more interests on the painting itself.,4,23 June 2005,"Young woman with a Pearl Earring is a painting by the Dutch painter Vermeer Van Delf during 1665-1666. Tracy Chevalier, a writer, wrote a book named ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" about it,telling the story of Vermeer and the model Griet. I have never read this book, but I happened watch the film. Frankly, I was very disappointed by the film and have given some thought to the reason why it simply does not work. I 'd rather watch the painting itself more.Firstly, it seems to me that the film must be too dependent on the book. I guess the book would be much better. Words can express the feelings or thoughts. Films can't do like that. Films use dialogs, settings, facial changes, music etc to convey the information. I don't think the film does well to express the characters' deep emotions.This leads me to the second point of the criticism. Since the characters are not well-described or well-introduced to the actors, how could Colin Firth and Scarlett Johanson act properly? OK. it is the actor's job to exploit the characters thought the dialogs. But they still didn't find the right emotion to act the painter and the model. And I don't think this is the fault of the actors.As to Colin Firth, personally, I really enjoy his role in Briget Jones' Diary. He is the Mr.Darcy. But i don't think he is the right person for Vermeer, even though his screen image is like an artist. As to Scarlett Johansen, her role Grace in "" Horse Whisper"" is so amazing that I think she will be a great star in the future. However, her act skills and facial expression do not change much. I can still find Grace in her Griet. This is not good. She should have more emotional expression and break through the image of Grace. As to the other actors, sorry to say , i don't have much impression on them.OK. I can't wait to talk more about the painting. In 17th century, the renowned Baroque artist Johannes Vermeer painted ""Girl with a Pearl Earring,"" which has been called the Dutch Mona Lisa.""The Baroque period is remembered less by one specific style of art than as a period of time. Derived from the Portuguese baroque for ""irregular pearl,"" Baroque was comprised of many diversions from biblically based Renaissance painting. The Protestant Reformation unleashed artists from rote depictions of scenes from the Bible and allowed them to venture into increasingly more interesting domestic domains. Ladies of the day would pose before silent musical instruments in rooms adorned with the trappings of success, like maps of newly explored territories and shelves with expensive volumes of books. As the merchant class gained monetary status in the community, so did their desire to be painted, just as royalty was just a few decades earlier.The most well-known departure from Vermeer's calculated paintings is the intriguing, mysterious subject of ""Girl with a Pearl Earring,"" thought to be painted in 1665. In the painting, a young woman, adorned in an unusual head wrap and wearing a prominent pearl-drop earring, turns to face the painter over her left shoulder  eyes sympathetic and slightly lowered, mouth demurely parted. The moment captured by the painting is captivating  sexually charged yet undeniably innocent."" Haha..I love paintings.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
171,cavalli,Pretty hopeless.,1,22 December 2003,"The director of this film seems to believe that having a passing acquaintance with Vermeer's lighting style (or knowing a Director of Photography who does) is sufficient substitute for narrative, nuance, characterisation, composition or or any other kind of cohesive idea at all. Unfortunately it is not. Some of the images are pretty but none so beautiful, poignant or so suggestive of inner meaning as Vermeer's original which closes the film. The wait isn't worth it. The script and direction are utterly inept. Hopeless. Some points to the Art Department and a glimmer of promise in the performance of Scarlett Johansonn, which almost transcends the total lack of direction. See LOST IN TRANSLATION to see what this extraordinary young talent is capable of in the hands of a director who knows what she is about. Otherwise, visit an art gallery or read the book rather than endure this tedious botch.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
172,Sarah-72,"Decent, but could have been better",7,31 January 2004,"A few SPOILERS included:I'm surprised to read all the reviews praising the lighting in this film. While the light in the indoor scenes was beautiful, many of the ""outdoor"" scenes were quite obviously filmed on some kind of sound stage.  In one part at the beginning, (as Grete goes to her new household), it was obvious that a church steeple and clouds in the background were painted, not real.As far as plot, I read the book more than 2 years ago, and I can't figure out why they left a few things out.  For one, in the movie's beginning we see Grete chopping vegetables and arranging them on a plate.  If I remember correctly, in the book version, this is when Vermeer and his wife come to Grete's home to hire her.  Immediately, Vermeer is impressed by her Grete's aesthetic sense because of her beautiful arrangement.  This sets the stage for his recognition of her genius.The book ends with Grete debating over what to do with the pearl earrings...keep them, sell them (which will be a great financial help to Pieter and her), or get ride of them.  And in the book, we see her decision. In the movie version, I could barely figure out who, exactly, had given the earrings to her. (Did the other maid steal them?  Did the wife want to get rid of them because they were soiled?)  Our only clue is that there was lapis paint sealing them, so they must have been given to her by Vermeer.I also agree about longing for more dialogue!I don't mean to bash the film entirely, though.  Overall I liked it, but it could have been even better.  7/10",Girl with a Pearl Earring
173,backrowreviews,An Absolute Masterpiece,10,13 November 2003,"As of November 12, this elegantly simple and quietly beautiful movie about a meek and dejected teenage girl who becomes the maid of painter Johannes Vermeer in 1665 is my favorite movie of 2003.That slot previously was held by ""Lost in Translation."" Scarlett Johansson stars in both movies, providing understated but utterly convincing portrayals of sad characters briefly awakened from resigned hopelessness by older men. Although her characters in both movies share a certain melancholy, their circumstances could not be more different. In ""Lost in Translation,"" Johansson's fleeting luxury-Tokyo-hotel friendship with a burned-out movie star (Bill Murray) raises her spirits while she is being ignored by her rock-star-photographer husband. She is the exact opposite of moneyed and educated in ""Girl With a Pearl Earring,"" toiling as an illiterate  bottom-rung member of Vermeer's household staff because she has to support her mother and her blind father. (Although the story is entirely fictional, its details are so convincing that you never will look at the actual painting the same way again.) Johansson's daily drudgery in ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" is broken only by the confused feelings she has for the handsome but tight-lipped painter and for his art. Her reluctance to act upon those feelings, or even to speak (in what is nearly a silent performance), gives the movie a tension that manages to be heartbreaking without once devolving into sappy melodrama. Even though the basic plot here admittedly sounds like the stuff of cheap romance (""SHE INSPIRED HIM TO PAINT...WITH THE COLORS OF LOVE!""), it is played so honestly that it overcomes its time-worn genre trappings to seem fresh and genuine. There is a reason why this kind of yearning/denial/resolution stuff has worked for a couple of millennia, after all. ""Girl With a Pearl Earring"" director Peter Webber finds the classic in what so often is rendered as cloying or cliche. This also is one of the most breathtakingly beautiful movies ever filmed, with cinematography so lush and lighting so flawlessly lovely that I wondered if John (""Barry Lyndon"") Alcott had come back from the dead. Nearly every frame could be a page in a picture book, but the images go beyond mere prettiness. Lingering shots of Johansson's silently radiant face, of Vermeer's studio sanctuary, of a golden canal pathway, of a candle-lit 17th-century drawing room...they are like images from dreams, full of mystery and portent. Director of Photography Eduardo Serra should win the Oscar in a walk, if there is any justice in this world.The movie's score was composed by Alexandre Desplat, and must be singled out for avoiding easy cliches as artfully as the plot itself does. That is not to say the music is in any way cold or remote, however; it's the difference between cheap sentiment and emotional honesty. There are moments when the combination of image and music will make you get misty, but you won't feel as if you've been crudely goosed or tear-jerked-off. The final shot of the movie literally made tears run down my jaded, cynical face, but it was a case of being deeply touched, not sucker-punched. (And I'm a big enough man to admit it...sniff...) If possible, make the effort to see this movie in a theatre. Even the biggest home-video plasma monitor cannot possibly give you the total-immersion thrill of seeing this amazingly beautiful masterpiece on the big screen. It's the difference between admiring  a framed masterwork in a museum gallery versus seeing it on a postcard in the museum gift shop.",Girl with a Pearl Earring

Since the film focuses solely on Griet(Scarlet Johanson)'s point of view, Johanson gets all the good deleivery, and she did an excellent job. Still, Colin Firth, Tom Wilkinson, and the rest of supporting casts (mainly British character actors) were equally good. No compromise, period.One thing that still bothers me about this film.. after seeing it few hours ago, though I enjoyed very much, somehow not memorable enough to see it again besides for its technical achievements.I gave a film a solid 8 out of 10.

I was transfixed to the screen and transported back in time in a wonderful time capsule that is this film. If you are the kind of person with an interest in history, art and human social interaction, and you're the type of person who often wishes he could go back in time, then this film will do wonders for you. I just don't understand the comments about the pace or lack of action, for me the film makers were true to the subject, characters and period and got it 100% spot-on. It's just that, you either get it or not. It is refreshing to see the courage and self-respect of such film makers who risk going against the grain and resist temptation of diluting their art just to make it at the box office.The film was a success on so many levels; the acting, directing, cinematography, costumes and the lighting was just an eye treat. If you haven't seen the film yet, don't deprive yourself of it any longer but don't watch it with any high expectations (difficult I know with some of the positive reviews here) you just need to sit back and take it all in.",Girl with a Pearl Earring

She gains an interest in Vermeer, and in a way, also becomes his painting apprentice, helping him to mix paints, making creative suggestions about the paintings, and so forth. Vermeer introduces her to a rather different world that Grit has never known. And the two for a silent bond, a love for each other. Johannes appreciate's Grits company as a comfortable contrast to his mother-in-law, children, and especially his wife, he only seem to try to discourage his silly hobbies.But, Johannes and Grit cannot act on their feelings for each other, at least not aloud. Divorce was highly out of the question, for one thing. But second, Johanne's was dependent on the arrogant Van Rijn for his commissions, and Van Rijn wanted Grit. Disgusted as Johannes may have been, and only slightly able to protect her (you'll see what I mean in the finale), he can't totally reject his financer. Plus, there is the barrier of master and maid, presenting a rigid social structure. And for Grit, she can only play out her affair with Johannes vicariously through her boyfriend, the Butcher.Even if the story is not grounded in fact, or is based on little fact, the story of how Vermeer's painting, The Girl With a Pearl Earring came to be is one that presents a little mystery and romance to a painting. You can find something to appreciate it, beyond just consideration of the artistic elements of lighting or coloring, etc. In fact, art is always more fun with an intriguing story behind it (consider the controversy behind Whistler's 'Peacock Room').",Girl with a Pearl Earring

I admit that even though I am not into romantic movies, this one, Girl with a Pearl Earring, gets 10 stars from me.** This is sort of a spoiler warning, because I am not going to be revealing the actual parts but the performances which some people might not like** First off, Scarlett Johansson, now this is a good combination of beauty and acting skills in the same person. I can't imagine how hard it could be, to be in front of the camera for most of the movie and yet only speak, basically nothing. Its all about facial expressions and the movement of the eyes. And she does an excellent job of it.Colin Firth, though not in front of the camera as much as Scarlett Johansson, does an awesome job of letting the audience know whats going on by just his acting and not the speaking.*************END OF SPOILERS******************************************* The rest of the cast, all, fit in nicely. I didn't think there was a single character in the movie, out of place. One random person taken off or put on the set, and I think the delicate balance that portrays the realistic feeling, would have been messed up, causing the end of the world.The story itself, was great. If Johannes Vermeer had been alive and had seen the movie, he would have been a fool if he hadn't liked it, portraying his true life or not. The build up, is gentle and the set direction is realistic and these two elements combine to absorb you into the world of Johannes Vermeer.If you like Drama, watch this movie. If you like romance watch this movie. If you like good movies without regard for genre, watch this movie.

179,Lust_for_Life80,"Touching, don't miss it!",10,21 January 2006,"Girl With A Pearl Earring is a real masterpiece! Based on a novel by Tracy Chevalier, this film tells the story of Griet, a young maid who worked in the house of Johannes Vermeer, a Dutch painter who forms an attachment with Griet because of her unique appreciation of his art. While Vermeer's mother in law and patron are only concerned with the profit his art will bring, Griet sees the paintings for what they are: delicate insights into other people's lives.As the two get closer, Griet becomes the object of the jealousy and distrust of Vermeer's wife and daughter, and her life is realistically portrayed through all of its hardships. The relationship between Griet and Vermeer is never sexual, which is what makes the film lovely to watch: they do not try to force the two characters together, the friendship appears so natural and easily, and is more believable because of this.The film charts the difficulties the pair face as they try to maintain their unorthodox relationship, and culminates in Vermeer painting Griet. Both the original and the Scarlett Johansson versions of the painting capture the expression and emotion of the girl so vividly.Although not much happens in this film, it really is captivating to watch the connection between Vermeer and Griet develop as he notices her appreciation of art, and her beauty and innocence. The film is also, on one level, about Griet becoming less naive, as she has such an intense relationship with an older man, and by allowing Vermeer to paint her portrait and pierce her ear, she symbolically loses her innocence.Scarlett Johansson makes this film what it is, her screen presence is mesmerising even though she is not doing much. Her acting through facial expressions is really good, and Colin Firth also puts in a fine performance as he gradually reveals himself to Griet. The supporting cast are very well cast, and the sets of seventeenth century Delft are just beautiful.Watch this film, don't miss it!

The director and cinematographer certainly understood this theme, as evidenced by the beautifully lit and composed scenes.  Of course, there is more here - a very erotic undercoat just beneath the surface layer of paint, and the disruption it can bring to an otherwise stable existence.

183,the16throse,Watch this film! It is fascinating.,10,3 June 2004,"As someone who is a great fan of Vermeer and of the novel, I highly recommend Girl With A Pearl Earring. Nearly every shot taken in this movie is a perfect Dutch style composition. Any art student or art history aficionado can tell you that. I am so tempted to pop the DVD into my computer, pause it somewhere, and paint the screen capture, because the cinematography is so beautiful. The screenplay obviously didn't include everything that happened in the novel, which is a problem that even the greatest adaptations always have. However, the characters are perfect, and I saw some excellent decisions on the part of the screenwriter in deciding what to highlight within the plot. I believe that they got to the heart of the book. There were also some sweet little details that they left in for those of us who have read the book, and I can always appreciate that. The casting was perfect, and the acting was good all around. It was a challenging role for Scarlett Johansson, as her character has very few lines, yet is the soul of the story. The sexual tension in this movie is so thick you can cut it with a knife. The film is very intense, and I found myself being nervous for her often.The score was different, and very period sounding. The production design was absolutely flawless, as well as the costumes and makeup. Interestingly enough, a few of the scenes were lit entirely with flame rather than with electric lights, which made for some fantastic night scenes along the canal.The other thing I loved about this was that it was great slice of life from Holland in 1666. You really understand how difficult it was for servants and how the social hierarchies worked back in the day.As far as the opinions go about this not being a good film, what can I say? Those people either went in thinking that it was going to be a documentary about Vermeer, or they just didn't get it because it didn't have any car chases or explosions or graphic sex scenes or profanity. I thought it was great, and I recommend it to any art history buff, film buff, or anyone who likes a good domestic thriller. Fascinating.",Girl with a Pearl Earring

Although I would describe this movie as being somewhat reserved (perhaps too much so for many), my interest was captured and held throughout the performance. The tension that evolves as the artist Johannes Vandermeer and the housemaid experience a deep connection that so desperately wants to, but never can become passionate love, is made palpable because of the clear chemistry created between Colin Firth and Scarlet Johannsen in their respective roles. Scarlett Johannsen does an excellent job, but from my perspective it is clear that Colin Firth is the main reason this picture is so successful despite a format that can so easily become boring. His was a masterful performance. He played his character in such a way that few could have done; with a brooding passion that is simmering but always controlled beneath the surface. I don't know if he won an academy award for this, but he certainly deserved to.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
185,cindyr,Not what I'd hoped,6,12 January 2004,"Yes, it was beautifully shot.  Yes, it was lovingly directed.  The music was perfect.  I found it quite interesting when they were showing what Vermeer had to go through to create his paint and colors.  But whenever the fabulous Colin Firth was on screen I was so distracted by that dead thing on his head that I wanted to snatch it off and save him from it.  And I was on the edge of my seat wondering if the collagen was going to explode out of Scarlett Johansson's lips when she was biting on them to moisten them up.This movie took a long time to get started and went essentially nowhere. (In fact, my husband almost fell asleep a couple of times!)  I felt absolutely *no* sexual tension between Firth & Johansson.  I was also left wondering what was up with Mrs. Vermeer.  I have no idea why she was such a screaming, raving, lunatic bitch.  She must have been a dynamo in the sack what with all those kids and her being pregnant twice during the movie. Maybe that was why Cornelia was such a brat, trying to get attention and stand out from that crowd (not too trite) the movie surely didn't give us any other reason.  Possibly it was mentioned in the book, however I do not think I should have to read a book upon which a movie is based before I see a film.

When the artist notices that she has a discerning eye (for light, colour, composition), a bond between the two ensues, much to the displeasure of Vermeer's jealous wife. Vermeer wants to paint the maid's portrait, and the film depicts this secretive undertaking (the wife is not to know of it) with all the intensity of a sexual liaison; the careful seduction of the shy girl; the tenderness of the affair itself; the dramatic discovery by the hysterical wife - at the hight of the affair there is even a penetration, laden with significance, of the girl's virgin earlobe. But the film never gets crudely suggestive of sex. It is far too refined to even be able of crassness.Visually, the film is extremely attractive. Although in the outdoor scenes Delft looks peculiarly like Venice (for pecuniary reasons most outdoor scenes were shot in a second-hand studio set which originally did indeed represent Venice), the indoor scenes are exquisitely beautiful, sometimes literally breathtakingly so. Director Peter Webber, art director Ben van Os and director of photography Eduardo Serra often manage to suggest Vermeer-paintings in motion.If you like the works of Jan Vermeer, or if you enjoy a rich story of subtle intensity, soberly told, you simply cannot afford to miss this film.",Girl with a Pearl Earring

Is it just fans jumping on the band waggon in their admiration? No - it is a true description of this film because that is the word that jumps to minds on seeing this film. The lighting subtly filling corners in the painting studio, spilling over the actor's clothes, reflecting off the dark water as the guests arrive for the birth feast; this aspect of the film alone shows the hard work and dedication of the people involved to make this film look like a Vermeer painting. And it works. Perfectly.So do the actors, Colin Firth breathing life into the taciturn artist so completely, he effectively walks off the page in the novel and into our imagination. Scarlett Johannson portrays the innocence and youth of the maid Griet with equal skill and vivacity. Solo, these actors are a credit to their profession - couple, they are an erotic force to be reckoned with. Each fleeting moment of contact is so sexy because it never actually leads to anything between the two.So watch this film once, then watch it again to appreciate the effort made by the crew and actors to make this film truly deserving of the title 'beautiful'.",Girl with a Pearl Earring

However, there was virtually no character background/development, there are some very important moments (especially for those who have read the book) that are glossed over or their importance diminished by the lack of history found in the story and characters.I can't say this movie is horrible, nor do I whole-heartedly recommend it. I do think you should read the book first as it gives the audience more to the characters than you would ever get from just watching the movie. Of course, having read the book first was a bit frustrating in that I was looking for certain moments that I knew were vital for the story and they were never particularly well developed, but I can't imagine not having had the background the book provides. Overall I wouldn't pay full price - go to a matinee or rent it - just read the book first.",Girl with a Pearl Earring

He's really a great actor and a very handsome man, too. To tell the truth, if I was going to cheat on my husband, Colin would be the first and only rival of him!!!

The story is told with very few words but you do not miss them. When characters speak, it blends smoothly with beautiful soundtrack and colors. The story is simple but elegantly told. Those who look for action and complexity can find it challenging. Here you need to follow the flow without hurry. But slow as it is, the story never feels tedious or too long. The result is mesmerizing. Aesthetically it reminds of The House of the Mirth.

Book adaptations often prove disappointing after you have already read the book, so I was a bit afraid that I wouldn't enjoy the film to its fullest. Indeed, the makers had to leave some elements out, or shift some scenes into time, which could come as a bit of a surprise, but the beauty of the film lies in its cinematography. It's as if every image is a little painting by itself. The light, the costumes and the scene are so wonderfully and delicately chosen, that the movie seems to have a sort of glow, enchanting the audience.

We all went to the theater with high expectations, one because she loves Colin Firth's work, one because she was in the middle of the book and I because I had already read the book. None of us left the theater disappointed.This movie combines brilliant visuals with wonderful acting. The most impressive aspect was how Scarlett Johansen's character was played so flawlessly. Johansen didn't have a lot of lines, but her performance left you wanting to see more. This is probably the best acting from a young actress I've seen since Kirsten Dunst in Interview with the Vampire. Johansen's scenes with Firth allowed you to see how they became attracted to one another.This book easily could've been butchered when being made into a movie, but overall the plot didn't change much and when changes in characters were made, I believe they were for the better.This isn't a movie for those looking for a fast-paced high action movie.

197,sl1970,boring dull dull bore,1,22 November 2017,My ex husband and I have a long running joke about how boring this film is. In fact I forgot all about it until it showed up recently and once again I watched it just to laugh - I don't know if they re trying to portray how boring Amsterdam was in 1664 but that's the impression - poor working class people are giving a hackneyed cockney-ed accent and posh people a rich upper class English accent. The main character Griet by Scarlet Johanson has a lower lip hanging open the whole time proposing her lack of intellect. Her eyes and their expression never once change from embarrassment of her sex.How any man could even spend time talking with this mono-syllabic robot was beyond us.No other actors speak more than 3 syllable's in each sentence.In summary it is the most boring film I have ever seen. The fact its rated so highly on here worries for the poor like me who today cant afford to waste their money and truly this film is a waste of time and money this is the third time I've seen it and Im writing a review whilst its on in the background on a closed window and believe me Im not missing anything,Girl with a Pearl Earring

Every scene looked like a painting and they perfectly captured Vermeer's light . I also liked the historical references to how Vermeer liked to paint young people so he could work on big surfaces of colour and avoid the shading wrinkles give. The music was beautiful and gave off a Dutch feeling of the 17th century as it should have. The time customs that were mentioned are also a great asset.Griet looked so much like Vermeer's original painting that I thought in a moment that this was real (but of course it couldn't cause back in 17th century were no cameras around :p).It was a perfect movie for someone interested in art. Other might find it a bit tiring but if you are an art lover you definitely have to watch this.,Girl with a Pearl Earring

200,emil_bohman,"Excellent making of the characters, still a bit uneventful.",7,5 March 2006,"Sixteen years old Griet's family has been suffering of economical crisis since her father became blind and could no longer paint tiles. Therefore, their daughter Griet starts working as a maid at the painter Vermeer to provide the family. Her daily chores in the big, child-rich household mainly consists of laundering and child-minding, but she has also been assigned the duty of cleaning the painter's studio without moving a single object in his meticulously constructed scenarios.As Griet develops her relationship with the family Vermeer, some kind of spiritual sympathy between Griet and Johannes is being increasingly felt. Vermeer teaches her to see things with an artist's eyes. Her creativity slowly rouses and creates an eccentric link between the two of them.When Vermeer's rich merchant Van Ruijven takes a liking to the cute maid and insists that Vermeer should paint her, the excitement intensifies. Rumors and gossips in Delft amplify the pressure, and when the painting is finished a dramatic scene erupts.Outwardly this seems like an incredibly dull and trivial book about a single painting, though inwardly the book is a compelling and penetrative insight into art, relationships and a 15th century Delft. I think the Chevalier uses a beautiful language and possesses the rare but marvelous ability to create realistic and mesmerizing relationships. Still the book isn't as convincing in terms of eventfulness. It actually didn't happen much in the book. Griet came to the house, got a few friends and enemies, and then left. I think it would be even more interesting if Chevalier evolved the last event and its consequences even more, and thus put several relationships to the test. And instead of casually mentioning that Vermeer has died I would like to have an almost exaggerating description of Griet's reaction and other consequences, but instead the story is abruptly cut off, as if she didn't have time and stamina to continue. I think that's very sad considering what a beautiful novel this actually is. Then, did this book live up to expectations? Well, I had almost no expectations at all before setting about this novel, so it's hard to say. But let me say that it was interesting in a way to read about relationships, but I miss events! I'll read one more book of this genre some other time to find out if these kinds of books are this uneventful (don't think so though). I don't want to leave you with a bad impression of the book, since the book is good. But if you're needy of eventful stories and don't find relationships and art interesting at all, this book isn't much for you.",Girl with a Pearl Earring

The acting is magnificent, I especially liked the way the painter's wive's character way formed. Scarlett Johansson is really great, considering she is really young, but extremely talented, which I think this movie proves. I think I could even draw a line from this movie to Lost in translation, because of the action flow, so I think that anyone who liked Lost in translation should enjoy Girl with a pearl earring. I maybe expected a bit more of this movie, but all in all I think it's really, really nice, with artistic motives which I find beautiful.

Both instances were brief (a good sleep never lasts does it?) and abruptly ended by my wife asking the boring-movie-indicator-question: ""Are you sleeping??"". The first one, just after Griet has met some random chick at a market place that later turns out to be a boy, lasted 13 seconds. In my dream i was Vermeer (the painter) and i hated myself for getting married to this horrible bitch of a wife. When i woke up, i happily remembered my own wife is much sweeter (and prettier too!). The second short sleep took me back to the film, but now i was Griet, the maid, and i wondered what the hell i was doing in this very weird outfit that totally didn't match my real-life sexiness. Again my wife woke me, this time slightly irritated by the fact i could sleep and she couldn't. We agreed to watch the rest of the film, and regretted that decision as long as it took us to fulfill it.

207,jennie-20,A modern masterpiece to rival Vermeer's own work,9,8 November 2003,"Having read the book by Tracey Chevalier I was eagerly looking forward to seeing the film, but a little apprehensive that it would be able to do justice to her story.  I need not have worried.  The film did not disappoint in any way.  Firstly the photography was like seeing a series of Dutch masters come to life.  You were transported back in time to Delft in the seventeenth century.    And the acting, what can I say - I think that almost without exception it was extremely well cast.  Perhaps a couple of characters did not tally with my mental images but the principals could not be faulted.  As the dialogue is minimal it could not have been an easy film for the actors who had to rely so heavily on expressions to convey their inner feelings.  Not surprisingly Colin Firth did an excellent job - he is a master in depicting his private feelings and emotions without actual speech. And Scarlett Johannson - for someone so young and relatively new to the film business she showed great insight in her portrayal of Griet.  The tension that arose between the two of them was palpable and really formed the core of the film.  I took my husband to see the film and was a little worried about his reaction as he normally prefers thrillers but need not have worried.  He was raving about the film to all our friends afterwards. I truly think it is a masterpiece like so many of Vermeer's paintings and hope it will have great success",Girl with a Pearl Earring
208,shaby923,Humanities,8,25 October 2007,"Aschylus Robinson Humanities 202 T.Th 3-4:45Girl with a Pearl EarringThe dress, language, attitude, and social segregation of the film are beautifully depicted. You get an actual sense of the time period and mood of the people then. The dress gave a very detailed reflection of the clothing of the late 1600's. Also a very pompous attitude and holier-than-thou society was accurately displayed in the film. In the film Griet, Vermeer's servant, is treated in a very degrading fashion by Vermeer's wife especially, she treats Griet as if she is an insignificant person in society. The people then had no respect of other people unless they were of the same caliber as them. That's showed clearly throughout the movie.In the film you get the impression that the relationship between Griet and her master Vermeer is deeper than a model-painter relationship. The director made you somewhat guess what their relationship consisted of. It seemed like in the movie there is an underlying intimate relationship between the two. Vermeer is intent on specifically having Griet as his muse even though his wife doesn't approve. Also, Vermeer becomes in a sense, protective and defensive over Griet. The director I think made it point to put the subject under the rug, because the movie ends not really knowing were the relationship is going. In the film the director lets us know who the Girl in the Pearl Earring is, it is established how she came about being the model for Vermeer's most famous painting. Vermeer at the end of the film is still kind of obscure. In the film he is very submissive and quite. Not very personable at all .You don't get to know anything about him and I think that is largely due to the fact that there are very little known historical facts about himA recurrent theme in the movie that attracted me to the movie is the relationship between Griet and Vermeer, her social standing verses his and the close bond they developed despite societal views. There is symbolism in the painting. The Girl with the Pearl Earring, Griet is a poor servant girl however in the painting she looks like a wealthy socialite. The painting allowed her to be viewed in a greater degree than the society in which she lived viewed her. Overall I liked the film. It wasn't over done like most films.

I read the book before I watched the movie, and I don't think it lived up to the book. I know that a movie will never be as good as a book, but I really think this movie was off. I didn't like how they left Agnes out of the movie completely, as I see her playing an important role. I also don't like how they ended the movie, because it wasn't really anything like the ending of the book. They left out certain things and added others that, in my personal opinion, weren't necessary. There are certain things that are particularly important to the story, and I don't think they were portrayed in the movie. It's a 233 page book, I don't think it would be that hard to stick to it in an hour and forty minute movie.

210,jkeats1,"A Wonderful Film Not Just about Vermeer, but Artistic Motivation",8,17 May 2004,"Johannes Vermeer was a silent man. Being equipped with immense talent, brush and palette, there really was no need for words. Such philosophy is greatly dwelt upon in Peter Webber's adaptation of Tracy Chevalier's novel. The film is breathtaking alone in the fact that the production team, led by cinematographer Eduardo Serra, production designer Ben Van Os, and art director Christina Shaeffer, manages to capture Vermeer's filling, oil-based colors, and light into every scene. The story is exemplary as well. We are taken into a brief era in Vermeer's life in 17th century Delft. Much of the film's premise is true: Vermeer was a reticent and brilliant painter who attempted to balance his genius and deep-rooted, innate calling to art and solitude with the often overbearing demands of a bourgeoisie, Venetian society, as well as the malignant pressures posted by a sadistic commissioner, and the pressures of being the head of a massive household (when he died in 1675, he left behind his wife and 11 children). In 1665, however, he painted a mysterious masterpiece. It's mysterious because much scholarship has since been dedicated to uncovering the identity of the model who posed for it. It has been suggested that the subject is one of his daughters, although this theory is met today with much skepticism. And this is where the film spends most of its fictional focus: that of creating an imaginary story to help speculate on what we know as factual about Vermeer's life. Enter a young, beautiful servant girl, Grit (Scarlett Johansson), who through no fault of her own, finds that her classic beauty attracts Vermeer's sensibilities-as a man and as an artist-to such a degree that he has no choice but to capture her on oil and canvas.Vermeer (Colin Firth) spends a lot of time in this film standing quietly in the shadows and peeking around corners. There's great symbolism in many of these shots-his body is often half-covered, half-exposed, representing the dichotomy he must have felt in his life-that of being in perpetual conflict with his spiritual, artistic longings and the more human qualities of a man.Whereas Vermeer' silence is a result of his being reluctant to communicate with the external world, mostly due to artistic self-absorption, Griet similarly is cut off from humanity, but rather out of innocence, naivety, beauty, and the unfortunate side effect of being at the low end of a rather oppressive Delft caste system where she has little voice outside of the disturbance her beauty stimulates in others. Together, the two characters find an unspoken solace, a type of kinetic energy that can only be conveyed through Vermeer's art. Indeed, one of the film's more touching moments comes when the artist reveals his portrait of her and Griet replies, 'You've seen into me.' Another memorable moment, if not altogether breathtaking, comes when Vermeer is instructing Griet in how to hold her face at the proper angle in order to catch the appropriate reflection of light on her mouth, and also when he is instructing her in how to mix his paints and their hands, for a split second, brush together. It is in such moments that Firth brilliantly conveys the tormenting dissonance present in a man not in whose base desires are overshadowing his artistic being, but rather the opposite-as a virtuoso experiencing a rare moment of temporary carnal pleasure. All philosophy aside, is the film any good? I'd say it's extraordinary, although if you're not one to gravitate toward the biography of an artist, this may not be the film for you. However, I do believe that the human story element her is valuable, entertaining, and worthwhile.",Girl with a Pearl Earring

I am still feeling the results of having seen this gorgeous film. I heard that it was nothing special--that it was a boring film--and that I shouldn't be too excited to see it. Yet, after studying Vermeer extensively for some time now, I felt compelled to view Peter Webber's take on the artist's life. I have not read Tracy Chevalier's novel that was the inspiration for this, yet I have heard that it depicts the story beautifully, with only the exception of leaving out a character or two. As a film, Girl With a Pearl Earring can stand on its own as a masterpiece.The film is not action packed, yet never was there a moment when I felt bored or noticed the lack of action. It was as serene as looking into the depths of a Vermeer painting-yet, dialectically, with also just as much emotional turmoil (for both the viewer and the characters involved). Firth and Johansson had undeniable sensuality as `master and maid'. Firth's portrayal of Vermeer was brilliant. One could truly see the torment in his eyes as he looked at a color, the sky, or Griet. It was as though he suffered for not being able to capture everything at once in one of his painstakingly careful paintings. And the visual world shown to us in Girl With a Pearl Earring makes these feelings understandable. Johansson was beautiful as usual. If Firth's eyes were what made his character striking, it would have to be Johansson's lips that really stood out. And this, also, is true to the painting that inspired all of this. She was perfect for this role. The score, the cinematography, and the acting all worked together to give the viewer the same sense that one gets when looking at the painting. This film captures all of its sensuality, colors, sadness, and torment beautifully.",Girl with a Pearl Earring

Each scene is an artistic composition of light, texture, and color - with some scenes simply breathtaking. It's a pleasure to view because it's well paced, wonderfully acted, and visually appealing.
The plot is strong but delivered in an understated manner, i.e. it's intelligent.  Told through the life of a 17 year old girl working in the artist's household, the picture richly conveys the emotion of even the minor characters.  In addition, the movie is erotic without ever being coarse.

Scarlett Johansson just keeps getting better with every film. Her portrayal shows a maturity and subtlety far beyond her years. She owns this film, and to have such an impact with very few lines is incredible. Judy Parfitt, Tom Wilkinson and Colin Firth also did fine jobs. Cillian Murphy is just a bit too pretty and refined for his role. Because of that, it is not clear that Griet chose him as an acceptable but somewhat boring escape from an impossible situation.

The performances of all the actors involved are outstanding, admirable for their general restraint, subtlety, and quiet passion.

I want two hours of my life back,2,11 July 2008,"With a book as successful and interesting as Girl With a Pearl Earring, one would think that a director would be passionate enough about translating it to the screen to make it worth a viewer's time. We are given no such offering. While the plot in the book and movie are analogous, the similarities end there. Our heroine, poor Dutch maid Griet, is sent to live with Johannes Vermeer, a famous Dutch painter. For those of you who have read the novel, it is quite obvious that the first five or ten minutes of the movie are incredibly rushed, as if they were the last scenes filmed just a week before the film's release date. Where the novel takes time explaining Griet's situation, (the circumstances under which she left her family, and where, exactly it was she was going), the film seems to disregard such ""trivialities"", thus leaving the viewer confused and pushed far out of the world created. Even for those of you who have not read the novel, something will still seem out of place. In fact, if you've seen any cinema at all, you will realize that the plot is well under way before we even learn many of the characters' names.What could potentially leave many viewers cursing both the screenwriter and the director of this film is the fact that our supposed heroine is a bumbling imbecile, but two steps away from complete retardation. She barely says a word and finds every single situation she happens to be in awkward and completely unusual, as if she's never taken clothes off the line in middle of winter. What makes her silence so powerful in the novel is the fact that the entire book is in first person. Whether she is speaking or not, we always get her opinion, her thoughts, her fears, her introspection of every sort. In the movie though, we are left to watch a frightened little mouse scurry around trying not to let anyone know she is in love with her master.So many seemingly minute, but, in actuality, extremely important details are left out in the film adaptation. Vermeer's wife, the ever-pregnant, commanding Catharina, is one of our most developed characters here. Easily aggravated, constantly scolding, we are given a halfway believable character to study. We know, that for some reason she is not allowed in Vermeer's studio, and we learn that she both fears and hates money troubles, which is why she wants to make sure Van Ruijven will continue commissioning work. But we do not know until the very end of the film that Vermeer has never once painted her. This small fact could potentially tell a viewer why she acts the way she does, why she constantly wants to see what her husband is painting. But the fact that we are left in the dark about it until the end of the film creates a major flaw in an almost good character.The script is uninspired, and often seems forced. The writer attempts to tie the novel and the movie together by throwing in some lines here and there taken directly from the original text. But in the context of the rest of the script, the ""stolen"" lines seem incredibly out of place. As if they're far too mature in this context.By the time we get to the climax of the story, the scenes where Griet gets her ear pierced and is seen with her hair down, we have stopped caring. The viewer can guess long before it happens that Griet will feel awkward about it and ultimately nothing good will come of it. Whereas the novel leaves us guessing how her relationship with her master will turn out, the movie creates its characters as two-dimensional talking heads. There is never any anticipation, or deep emotional meaning. A good movie leaves a viewer feeling. A viewer should walk out of the theater and think to himself, ""I'm different now."" The only difference a viewer might feel after viewing this visual catastrophe is anger. In fact if one wanted deep meaning, they'd have a better chance watching a film adaptation of a video game.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
221,roseofkiev,The Marring of a Masterpiece,1,29 December 2004,"To quote Tracy Chevalier, the originator of this pseudo-historical rubbish, ""Girl with a Pearl Earring is a story about a painting and how it came into being"". However, 'Girl with a Pearl Earring' is not a story about ""a painting"" as she put it; it is the title of a famous masterpiece that has been admired for over three centuries; the exquisite work of Dutch master Johannes Vermeer. Unfortunately, the title ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" was appropriated by Chevalier to serve as the title of what would have been, if not for the co-opted allure of the famed artist and his well known masterpiece, considered a run of the mill, garden variety historical romance; certainly nothing special. As many art historians fear, the transference of Chevalier's fabrication to the silver screen is sure to create misconceptions about the Vermeer legacy in the minds of those who are limited to the confines of contemporary awareness, that is, most of the population. Chevalier apparently gained an edge in the writer's market by exploiting the fame and creative efforts of an artist who has long been dead and is therefore unable to defend himself or the members of his family against the negative characterizations concocted by this mediocre novelist. Director Peter Webber was quoted as saying, ""Girl with a Pearl Earring was really inspired by the painting of the same name"". Inspired? Doesn't he mean that the ""painting of the same name"" was practically stolen and painted over for posterity with Chevalier's 21st century glitter glue? The fact that Chevalier and others have made a killing by irresponsibly trashing the memory of Vermeer and the members of his family to create an erotically suggestive tale says a lot about our culture. All marketing and no integrity.What did the Vermeer's family ever do to Chevalier to merit such post-mortem character assassination? They were merely related to the famous artist. One wonders how Chevalier would feel if she were likewise negatively depicted by some stranger after her death. Because the Vermeers were real persons who lived at one time, it is wrong to villify them in fiction three centuries later. The central characters in Chevalier's novel are not,as Chevalier suggests, merely spun from scant memories of persons who were known to have lived at one time. Chevalier contradicts or ignores the known facts of Vermeer's life. By all accounts, his marriage to Catherina who he did in fact paint several times (in contrast to what is suggested in Chevalier's storyline that he never painted her because she did not understand or appreciate his work)was a happy marriage. By the way, the Vermeer's had only the one maid, Tanneke, whom Vermeer also used as a model for some of his work.Chevalier defamed Vermeer's wife and family by crafting very unflattering and rather unimaginative character from their memory: Vermeer is the stereotypical brooding artist,his wife a vicious, ill-tempered,mean spirited, and jealous bitch. Catherina's demonic portrayal was obviously necessary as a literary device to justify and evoke sympathy for the illicit undertones in the relationship between Vermeer and the fictional Griet. Vermeer's daughter Cornelia was depicted as a child whose behavior is so pathologically anti-social, she would probably be judged today as a child at risk for growing up into a serial killer.Come to think of it, while Ms.Chevalier's fictional ingénue surfaces as the only noble character in the entire story, her fictional renditions of the Vermeer family cast them as the horrid folks from which she must attempt to shield herself. So henceforth, as far as popular culture is concerned, Vermeer is trapped in a miserable marriage, his wife and daughter are cold hearted witches, his mother-in- law the head shrew, and his patron the most lecherous man in Delft!The worst thing about the film version of ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" however, is that the image that will appear in association with Vermeer's masterwork in the future, will be Scarlett Johansson's Griet. Hers is a performance that could only be described as vapid and which consists mainly of Johannson's perpetual look of dumb surprise, her mouth hanging open continually, which although was probably meant to be seductive, looks more a general lack of intelligence or a contrived expression of feigned innocence. She was supposedly demure but appeared more or less bovine. It was a face that I grew so tired of by the end of the film, that I dearly wished the wicked and capricious (per Chevalier's fictional interpretation)Catherina would have given it a good slap when she went all out in her tirade in the final scenes.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
222,gerryfromireland,Lovely film with powerful yet subtle drama of human relationships,9,14 January 2005,"The book holds some intriguing sub-plots not in the movie, though the play of light in this movie makes it lovely, juxtaposed the drama of the human relationships. Griet is our hero and men are the tyrants, art rising above all. A movie to re-watch, one to buy, and Scarlett was most beautiful in this. The story of a piece of art can be determined through primary research, correlating the piece with events of the time, and then by conjecture surrounding the drama and beauty of the piece. Where the book does a great job in all these regards, the film does it best with the period behaviors, costumes and ambiance. This movie gives you a fly on the wall perspective of the lives of the characters and really the acting is nothing short of superb.Bravo!GW",Girl with a Pearl Earring
223,xristost,Beautiful like the painting of an old Dutch master,8,14 January 2005,"I have just seen ""Girl with a pearl earring"" and I am already willing to see it again. The feeling is very much the same as wanting another tour in a gallery of paintings of old Dutch masters, to enjoy repeatedly the beauty of light and shadow and colours. Scarlett Johansson is both very pretty and talented and the camera lovingly moves around her, searching for her beautiful eyes and puffy lustful lips, very much reminding me of Bertolucci's love for the beauty of Liv Tyler in ""Stealing beauty"". Colin Firth is again producing a most powerful impact by his tall dominating figure, deep beautiful voice and reserved yet sensual and passionate attitude.

I read the book after I saw the movie just because I enjoyed it so much. The part that impresses me so much about this particular movie is that with the lack of dialogue in some scenes there is such strong acting from Scarlet Johasson. I might be biased as I am a fan of her work to begin with but I think this movie really sets a standard for young aspiring actresses. While I enjoyed Scarlet I still have yet to see a movie that actually show cases Colin Firth's talents. I like him but I think that his characters are all the same. He is somewhat suited to this role I think. It's more of the tortured, sensitive, silent guy. But All in all I loved this show despite the monotony of Colin.

And we lie to ourselves as we lie and wallow in our colors the pieces of light, but not The Light.

Do you remember how it is to go along wide halls and to look at works of art from different parts of the world. So, some years ago my relatives and I have visited the Tretyakov State Gallery. I walked through the spacious halls and pictures flashed one after the other. I can't turn my mind to the exact one. I was a child and it was boring for me to spend my free time like this. But in spite of it some pictures were kept in my mind. And last week my teacher advised me to watch the film ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"". As for me I don't like watching films at all. In my opinion it is not the best way to spend free time. But the name of this film was familiar to me and I decided to watch. At first I thought it would be something similar to Hollywood films. But it wasn't. This film tells us a beautiful story about the history of creation of the picture ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"". There are very few episodes with long pretentious speeches. The main actors use few words; they show feelings of their characters through movements and emotions. More than that I can say that the atmosphere of the city and of the house where the actions take place is realistically shown. So, it was really surprising for me to find one of the pictures which I saw in my childhood in this film. I didn't expect this film to be interesting for me. I thought: ""It is just to see and forgive, like the most films."" But after reviewing I changed my opinion. That's why, if you are tired from typical films with predictable ends, ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" will be just a breath of fresh air.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
227,anghielinaivanova,Girl with a Pearl Earring,10,10 February 2016,"A painting ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" of a Dutch artist Jan Vermeer is famous all over the world. Dutch Mona Lisa is looking at you from the painting. Who is this beautiful stranger with large enigmatic eyes and with an earring? Peter Webber, a producer of the film ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"", is trying to find an answer to this question. The year of 1665. The Netherlands. Young Griet is a maid in the house of a famous Dutch artist, whose name was Jan Vermeer. He realized at once that the girl had the same opinion on different problems. Griet was the only person whom Vermeer could trust to knead dyes a camera-obscure. Nobody at home could understand his affection towards the maid. The girl posed for one of his paintings. That was the reason for Jan's relatives to expel her from the house. The main attention is paid to the artist and his muse. Colin Firth and Scarlett Johansson were able to act all feelings and emotions of the heroes professionally. Griet fell in love with the artist, but she understood that there was a huge social difference between them. I suppose that it was not love for the artist. I think Griet was a source of inspiration. The producer shows Vermeer as a person who felt affection to Griet. But on the other hand he couldn't insist on her staying at home. One of the main advantages of this film is the fact that the producer gives a chance to the spectators to make conclusions themselves. Nevertheless, this film isn't for everyone. The absence of familiar rashness can be rather dull for modern people. Those who understand art will pay attention to light contrast and even to small details, many of which are still not evident. The symbols of this film are pearl earrings, hidden hair, ceramics. Everyone has his own associations with them. In conclusion I'd like to recommend this amazing film to my contemporaries, because it shows a wonderful world of culture and art of the 17th century.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
228,mylova,An Amazing film,9,10 February 2016,"""Girl with a Pearl Earring"", directed by Peter Webber, was shown to the public in 2003 and, as far as I can guess, it immediately caught people's attention. The things that attract spectators are the casting and the feelings that can be found in the film. The action takes place in The Netherlands. It is a story about a poor young woman Greet with big expressive eyes, who began to work as a maid in the house of a famous artist, whose name was Johannes Vermeer. These two people found it pleasant to talk to each other and very soon the artist suggested that Greet should pose for him in his wife's pearl earrings. Of course, none of his friends and relatives liked the idea. The final made me sad. You will understand why, when you watch the film yourself.Colin Firth and Scarlett Johansson played in such a good way, that they were able to show all the feeling and emotions of the heroes. I admired their acting during all the film. Moreover, the music and the costumes were also quite good. However, some people won't like this film, as there are several moments when dirty streets and poverty are shown. Another fact is that there is no much action in the film, that's why it may seem boring, but I don't agree with this. As for me, the main thing is not the action itself, it is the plot that makes you sympathize with the main heroes and understand their feelings.From my point of view, this film worth giving time to. I watched it together with my mother and she shared my opinion on the actors and the plot. So, I believe, ""Girl with a Pearl Earring"" suits both teenagers and adults.

229,whitecold,What is the mystery of the plot?,9,10 February 2016,"If you tired of usual movies and want to take thorough pleasure, you should watch ""Girl with a Pearl Eaeeing"". This film will already intrigue you on the first minutes and it will be continuing up till the very end. On the first sight this film could seems you like boring and tiresome, however, if you continue watching, you realize, how wonderful it is. This mysterious plot without clear end make you think about important issues you haven't thought before. You may be in some shock after the screening. The action takes place in the Dutch Republic, in 1655. Griet (Scarlett Johansson) is a shy girl, which started to work as a maid in the house of Johannes Vermeer (Colin Firth). She is quite and doesn't attract many attention from the house residents. Nevertheless, she drew the attention of the Johannes Vermeer, because, despite her young age, she can feel the process of the painting, colors, mechanism for creating pictures. Vermeer appreciates her deep in sight and once ask her secretly to pose for a new picture... Actors coped with their roles perfectly. Glances, smiles, silence, tone of voices - all of in is played distinctly. The director - Peter Webber - managed with the transfer of the main idea. Music by Alexandre Desplat, who also worked on the films like ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"", ""The King's Speech"", ""The Twilight Saga: New Moon"" is fantastic and it helps us to feel deeply what the main heroes are feeling. To sum up, it can not be denied that some films we watching are marginally creating our culture, our world outlook, and this very film could give us many different interesting issues for thinking about. You can enjoy this film in all occasions: sunny day or rainy night, in a good mood on in a bad spirit.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
230,olya-79344,"""The secret history of the extraordinary masterpiece""...",10,18 February 2016,"There are some movies that can be called ""my movies"" from the first minutes."" The girl with a pearl earring"" is one of them for me. This movie is rather unusual, not all people will estimate it. The picture doesn't have fascinating plot or prompt development of actions. It is far from a mad rhythm of modern life. That's why it's so charming.The acting is impressing. It is very important that actors are deprived of a present raid for such films. Colin Firth ideally got used to a role of the mysterious artist, a creative person. He is shown acute, thoughtful, impulsive and imperious.Scarlet Johansson showed us the pensive young girl masterly. Her heroine is naive a little , but she has fine sense of beauty.It is one of the few movies which I know where love is expressed by views and gestures. Jan Vermeer and Griet's relations are pure and touching, and we can understand their feelings to each other without words. There are pretty number of dialogs in the film, but the essence of the movie is transferred precisely and beautifully. All picture ""is surprisingly silent"" and it creates its atmosphere. I think, this ""silence"" , the muffled colors and bright white light so helped to recreate measured life of medieval Holland from which it is impossible to take away a look.We see green channels and dirty streets against contrast: picturesque landscapes, quiet avenues, pure sheets in the cozy small court yard. The film is very atmospheric, you derive aesthetic pleasure from viewing. Moreover, the requisite is picked up with a big accuracy and attention.There is a separate wish to allocate Alexander Depl's music, without it ""The girl with a pearl earring"" would lose a half of the charm. It made strong impression on me, the movie ended, but the desire to listen to this wonderful music again and again remained.It is natural to become interested in Jan Vermeer's creativity after the movie. Unambiguously I recommend ""The girl with a pearl earring "" for viewing.",Girl with a Pearl Earring
231,marty-09195,Scarlet's acting is weird,1,30 April 2016,"First, this is a chick flick. There is very little action; it's all about a girl's feelings; it takes an incredibly long time for the plot to develop; and finally, only a chick flick would devote major time to a girl getting her ears pierced (a metaphor for sex, but still boring). After one hour into the movie, we finally find out that a fat, rich guy has commissioned Vermeer to paint Griet (Scarlet's character), while also expecting to have sex with her. That would make her one heck of an expensive whore, but (get ready for it) the ""twist"" is that she's just a conservative servant girl. Yes, believe it or not, that's what the whole movie is about! Also, it's about the pearl earrings changing hands. Exciting stuff, huh?The main problem lies with Scarlet's acting. Sometimes her eyes are shifting all over the place (mostly up and down), and at other times she stares. I feel like she should have been portrayed as a strict Calvinist. However, we aren't given enough background information to know for sure how puritanical her morals are, plus she sometimes stares right into Vermeer's eyes, which is not what a highly religious girl would do. So sometimes she seems to be ""asking for it"" (I don't mean asking to be raped so please don't go there), and other times she pulls away from him as if in terror. So the character is very inconsistent and not well developed, despite all the screen time devoted to her.I know that girls, especially teenage girls, can be rather weird, inconsistent, and hard to read. Even so this character portrayal seems phony and hard to watch due to all the eye movements and staring; dumbly hanging her mouth open; at other times opening and closing her mouth like a fish; staring at a mistress or master somewhat brazenly before bowing her head in a supposed gesture of respect; going around in silence most of the time but at other times speaking boldly; etc. It's all too freaky and weird for me.Scarlet's mouth and face are beautiful, but to those who say one reason they watch the movie is just to see her mouth and face, I say go buy a poster of her instead of wasting almost two hours on this. In fact, a quick google tells me there are some nude photos of her floating around, but I probably shouldn't go there.Other potential faults of this movie: Vermeer, though he is already a famous painter and the breadwinner of the household, is depicted as henpecked and allowing the mother-in-law to dominate the household.Even though Vermeer's wife hears lots of rumors that Vermeer is painting Griet (the rumors are all over town and throughout the house), she doesn't go check on him while he is painting and catch him in the atrocious act of having Griet model fully clothed for his painting. Quelle horreur!The worst thing is that this fictional movie is unfair to the real Johannes Vermeer, and to his family and descendants.",Girl with a Pearl Earring

Usually when I read a book before seeing the movie, I feel that the movie doesn't portray it as well. I disagree with the previous comment, I don't think this movie was supposed to be about the painter Vermeer, but rather about Griet and how the she experienced her life at the house and how the painting came into existence. I really enjoyed the background that I had from reading the book and how it added to viewing the movie. We believe what are eyes see to be true, but if you don't know how a person got to that moment, you're not seeing the entire pictures.

Also, each frame is itself like a painting, in the way the light is cast over the scene and over the characters. Not much is said, because the main character in this movie are the images, not the dialog. But the lines of the characters, although not long or rich or spectacular, say the essential. The rest is said by their eyes and look, by their gestures and movement. The surroundings are also carefully depicted, very true to the real seventeen century world.
