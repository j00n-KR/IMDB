0,SnoopyStyle,Why so many gay jokes?,4,8 June 2015,"Doug is a dentist who feels stymied by his life and his diet restrictions. Bobby is a wife-whipped plumber who has to return to work after a year of trying to write his book. Dudley is a bumbling computer programmer. Woody is broke getting divorced from his model wife. All four guys find relief riding their Harleys as the Wild Hogs. Woody suggests putting some real miles on their bikes. They get in trouble with a gay cop (John C. McGinley) and a motorcycle gang led by Jack (Ray Liotta). Dudley finds love with diner owner (Marisa Tomei).The first time McGinley appears is where the movie lost me. It is borderline offensive without actually being funny. The silly gay jokes keep coming along with a menagerie of other silly jokes. I did laugh a couple of time. Mostly I was laughing at how stupid the movie gets. I do feel sorry for the guys who seem to have a little bit of chemistry. If only they write some heart-felt material for them, this would be a good road movie. I usually like a good rood movie but this is too idiotic.",Wild Hogs
1,claudio_carvalho,Middle-Aged Easy Rider,8,30 April 2007,"In Cincinnati, the dentist Doug Madsen (Tim Allen) is in crisis, bored with his middle-class life and missing his reckless youth when he was known as the Golden Biker. The aspirant writer Bobby Davis (Martin Lawrence) feels pressed by his wife and hates his job. The shy geek computer analyst Dudley Frank (William H. Macy) is unsuccessful with women. The wealthy Woody Stevens (John Travolta) is married with a top-model. Together, the four middle-aged friends in their motorcycles self-call the ""Wild Hogs"". When Woody loses his wife and is completely broken, he invites his friends to take a road trip to the Pacific, in a quest for freedom. After many incidents, they stop for a beer in a bar owned by the dangerous biker gang ""Del Fuegos"". Their tough leader Jack (Ray Liotta) steals Dudley's motorcycle, and Woody decides to recover the bike back. Woody cuts the fuel pipes of the bikes and provokes an accident, exploding their bar, but he does not tell the truth to his friends. When they stop in the small town of Madrid without gas, Dudley falls in love for the waitress and owner of the local bar Maggie (Marisa Tomei). However, the ""Del Fuegos"" traps them in the town and the ""Wild Hogs"" have to take an attitude.""Wild Hogs"" was a great surprise for me. I went to the movie theater with my wife and we decided to watch this movie because of the cast, mostly because of John Travolta, but with very low expectations. We found one of funniest movie that we have recently seen. ""Wild Hogs"" will certainly never be nominated to an Oscar, but it is excellent in its proposal, i.e., make the audiences laugh. The excellent William H. Macy shows that he is also a brilliant comedian, with hilarious sequences in the role of a clumsy biker. The situations are extremely humorous and amusing and I am still laughing while writing these lines. Ray Lliota is perfect in the role of the mean leader of the gang. Marisa Tomei probably found the Fountain of Youth, because she is still as beautiful as in ""My Cousin Vinny"". Kevin Durand playing the gay highway patrolman and the stupid tall ""Del Fuego"" biker (I do not know the name of this actor) are also great. And the joke with Peter Fonda in the end of the story is a great homage to ""Easy Rider"" and I regret only the absence of Dennis Hopper. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Motoqueiros Selvagens"" (""Wild Bikers"")",Wild Hogs
2,kosmasp,Less than the ingredients,6,14 April 2007,"One would be excused for expecting more from a comedy with those talents. But it just happens to lose quite a bit of it's taste along the way. You have great comedy actors here, but they seem from time to time, as if they're stuck in their roles. In a bad way! Which doesn't make the movie bad.I've seen worse and the movie is quite funny, but it lacks the real emotion it is aiming at. Because this movie is not just trying to make you laugh, it also tries to bring home some serious drama. It's a shame you won't get everything you hoped for, but it's still a decent enough comedy, with some excellent highlights! :o)",Wild Hogs
3,classicsoncall,"""Life's short. Go nuts!""",6,11 August 2012,"What an incredibly sad waste of talent from an ensemble cast of well known actors who should have known better. Ostensibly this was one of those mid-life crisis films that held promise with it's four male leads, but the effort got squandered early and never really made up for it. Now individually, I like Travolta, Allen and Macy; haven't seen enough of Martin Lawrence to make the same judgment. However putting them all together was a classic case of getting less with more. On top of that, with John Travolta's recent bad press regarding his alleged homo-erotic behavior, that skinny dipping scene in the pond was all the more troubling. To be fair, there were a couple of scenes that elicited a chuckle, but I can't even remember what they were now. So much for being memorable. I read another review on this board from a viewer who wished he had seen more of Marisa Tomei; for that I'd recommend ""The Wrestler"". If you've seen it you'll know what I mean.",Wild Hogs
4,gavin6942,Disposable Comedy,5,27 June 2012,"A group of suburban biker wannabes looking for adventure hit the open road, but get more than they bargained for when they encounter a New Mexico gang called the Del Fuegos.Who are two terrible comedians? Tim Allen and Martin Lawrence. Who is a terrible actor? John Travolta. Why not put them in a movie? The answer is obvious to anyone who sees this: because it will be a steaming pile of garbage.The only really redeeming thing is seeing how buff John C. McGinley is. Did he work out or was that always hidden under there? The running homosexual joke is childish and gets a bit old, but has a bit of existential humor given that Travolta has long been dogged by rumors of his sexuality. Intended? No. Funny? Yes.Oh, and Ray Liotta is always a treat.",Wild Hogs
5,jboothmillard,Wild Hogs,4,22 December 2010,"I think I may have watched a few of the short trailers on television, the fact that it had the four actors it did and that it was all set on the road was good enough for me to make me watch. Basically in Cincinnati, dentist Doug Madsen (Tim Allen) is having a mid life crisis and bored with his life, writer Bobby Davis (Martin Lawrence) is almost controlled by his wife, shy geek computer analyst Dudley Frank (William H. Macy) has no luck with women, and wealthy Woody Stevens (John Travolta) is married to a model. All four middle-aged men wish they could back to their younger days and become rebellious and reckless, and with Woody's encouragement that is exactly what they plan to do. The friends get their motorcycles raring to go, and black leather jackets saying ""Wild Hogs"" on, and they are ready to take the open road heading for the Pacific and a sense of freedom. Along the way they have one getting a bashing off the bike, a homosexual Highway Patrolman (Scrubs' John C. McGinley) coming onto them, and are caught naked in a rock pool by a picnicking family. But they carry on regardless and stop at a bar owned by the dangerous ""Del Fuegos"" biker gang, led by the tough Jack (Ray Liotta) who hates them for trying to be a biker gang themselves. After Dudley has his motorcycle stolen, Woody goes back to retrieve it, opens all the gang's fuel caps, and with the drop of a light causes an explosion, which he does not tell the truth about to the others. After a squabble or two about that happened, Dudley falling in love with Madrid local bar owner and waitress Maggie (Marisa Tomei), there is a showdown of bikers. In the end, after the meanies are defeated with the help of Damien Blade (Peter Fonda), the four friends are reunited with the people in the regular lives, and things change for the better. Also starring Kevin Durand as Red, Lost's M.C. Gainey as Murdock, Jill Hennessy as Kelly Madsen, Dominic Janes as Billy Madsen, Heroes' Stephen Tobolowsky as Charley and Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny's Kyle Gass as lead singer Kyle. The four leading actors, who have had really good careers between them, do alright as the gang of Harley-Davidson ""hog"" riding pals, I was expecting some Easy Rider style stuff, and the story should have been a bit better, but it is not a boring road movie comedy adventure. Okay!",Wild Hogs
6,tavm,Wild Hogs is an amusing showcase for the four stars,6,3 March 2007,"Okay, I wasn't prepared to find this movie funny, as evidenced by my thinking the trailer was too silly and I think I only chuckled at William H. Macy's goof-up at the beginning. But it grew on me as the picture went on the road and stopped first at a bar owned by a motorcycle gang led by Ray Liotta at his most game and then at the small town of Madrid (pronounced MA-long a-DRID). John Travolta, Tim Allen, and Martin Lawrence round out the title gang as they attempt to put some excitement back into their life. Amusing and even some hilarious slapstick abound with mostly wonderful support among familiar faces like John C. McGinley (Scrubs), hilarious as a gay cop, M. C. Gainey (Dukes of Hazzard movie, Lost), nicely played second-in-command to Liotta, Jill Hennessy (Law & Order, Crossing Jordan) as Allen's wife, Steve Landesberg (Barney Miller) as Travolta's accountant , Tichina Arnold (Pam on Lawrence's show Martin) as-surprise-Lawrence's wife, and Marisa Tomei (Oscar winner for My Cousin Vinny) as Macy's love interest. No great shakes but mostly enjoyable throughout as a lark. Don't miss a surprising tag during the closing credits. Or a surprising cameo before that.",Wild Hogs

This is not ""Easy Rider.""The film is absolutely inane, stupid, ridiculous and all other negative adjectives that can be used to describe this.What were the acting talents of Travolta, Tim Allen, Willian H. Macy and Ray Liotta thinking when they made this film? Martin Lawrence too. Marisa Tomei is along for the ride and this former Oscar winner must have gone off the wall to even appear in this utterly moronic film.Is there a mid-life crisis here? That could have been dealt with at a greater extent.The wild bunch that the 4 guys encounter with Liotta as their head have IQs with negative integers.

These suburbanites decide to hit the road with a cross-country motorcycle adventure starting in Cincinnati and ending on a California beach.

In New Mexico, these amateur care-free souls meet up with a ""real"" biker gang, The Del Fuegos, led by Ray Liotta. Belly busting. screwball situations and laugh-out-loud misadventures provide a great escape. These four actors work well with each other and you can tell they enjoy playing off of one another.

Little prepare them for what they will have to face in places where butch biker culture is prevalent. These are straight men who act a lot as though they weren't, in many occasions.The one question that comes into one's mind is ""What are John Travolta, William H. Macy, and Marisa Tomei, or even Ray Liotta, doing in the film?"" Well, maybe they needed to redo the decor of their stately mansions, or perhaps they needed to see a Beverly Hills orthodontist, or they were just hard up for some easy cash. Otherwise, it's hard to understand what motivated them to be in this silly comedy that will not add anything to their resumes.On the other hand, it's easy to see Tim Allen and Martin Lawrence involved in the project because they are basically television products that only aspire to just a certain degree of what could pass for ""acting"".The film reminds us of better made films like ""City Sleekers"", just to name one. Directed by Walt Becker with a screenplay by Brad Copeland, it will probably become a favorite of many in the reruns.",Wild Hogs

Its rare these days to run across a flick like this that would be worth seeing in the theater. jovial and good natured, with JohnTravolta and Peter Fonda actually turning in good performances this is one of those movies that will be on cable forever and which you'll stop to watch every time.Is it great, oh dear god no, but its a little engine that could sort of movie that does exactly what it was suppose to-entertain-even in a been there done that sort of way. I was shocked that it was as good as it is. Its sort of like in baseball's inter-league play, where the pitchers who never hit suddenly surprise everyone by hitting a double or a triple.

12,lastliberal,City Slickers on Wheels,5,20 January 2008,"Looking for laughs? They are extremely rare in this film.Yes, the gay cop bits were funny, but not laugh out loud funny.William H Macy (Fargo) played an eco-conscious computer geek comes out of the forest carrying a plastic bag full of his own shite. He was the best thing in this film, and he symbolically held up the rest of the film in that bag.Of course, I would have liked to see more of Marisa Tomei (My Cousin Vinny), but that will never happen.The biker gang was just pathetic and the bit during the end credits was sick.",Wild Hogs
13,Boba_Fett1138,And I was expecting a fun comedy.,5,23 August 2008,"The movie was pretty disappointing. I never expected great things from it but it always looked to me like a fun and entertaining movie and most reviews also indicated this. The movie unfortunately comical wise has more misses than hits in it.Yes, its still a movie that has its moments and provides some entertainment. It's a movie that will make you laugh, almost guaranteed a couple of times but unfortunately most of the jokes are extremely lame and just totally predictable as well. The movie is just being too formulaic at times, despite having a good original and promising premise.It's a movie with lots of characters and big actors in it but it are the cameos and the performances from the non-comical actors are the most fun ones. Actors such as Ray Liotta, John C. McGinley, Peter Fonda and principal actors William H. Macy and John Travolta. Martin Lawrence never is really funny as a main lead but when he plays a secondary character or the main lead next to another big actor (like in ""Bad Boys"" with Will Smith) he is simply good and also funny. Same in this movie goes for Tim Allen. I'm not a too big fan of him but I could certainly stand him in this movie.I wished the movie had some more story though. It could had been a movie filled with life lessons but it's a pretty empty movie with its themes. There are some real missed opportunities here. The movie its story is just basically one big road-trip, with new adventures and characters around every corner but it's just not as fun as it sounds though. It's too simplistic and rather pointless. The movie even sends out wrong messages at times, that makes you think why did they ever put it in there.Just not the good fun movie that I expected.5/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Wild Hogs
14,ferguson-6,Ride Posers Ride,3,2 March 2007,"Greetings again from the darkness. The best thing I can say about this one is I tip my cap to the producer/casting director for assembling a remarkable cast in spite of the (at its best) lame script. The 4 middle aged men hitting the road to rediscover their soul is simply no comparison to either of the ""City Slicker"" films.Directed by Walt Becker (""Van Wilder"") and written by Brad Copeland (""My Name is Earl"", ""Arrested Development""), the biggest surprise is the paucity of memorable, or even slightly funny one-liners. Tim Allen and Martin Lawrence should have been able to come up at least a handful of zingers, instead there are maybe 2-3 that warrant a chuckle.This pack of famous actors is unable to salvage this unfunny comedy. John Travolta, in particular, is over the top and just sad in most scenes. William H Macy has the most to work with and actually has the best moments in the film. Martin Lawrence and Tim Allen are wasted. Additionally, Martin Lawrence is 10-15 years younger than the other three leads. How did they grow up together?The supporting cast is deep and mostly underutilized. Marisa Tomei has made 6 years of bad script decisions (since 2001's excellent ""In the Bedroom""). What's wrong with her? She is talented, beautiful and charming ... and for goodness sake, she has an Oscar! Find a decent script lady. Jill Hennessey (""Crossing Jordan""), Ray Liotta, the Sklar twins and a cameo by Peter Fonda are all disappointing. The exceptions are John C McGinley in a slightly funny turn as a very interesting motorcycle cop and Stephen Tobolowsky as the internet-trained small town sheriff.In addition to the beating provided by the script, as a viewer we are subjected to numerous product placements by Apple Computers ... including a ridiculous tat on Mr. Macy's bicep; and even worse is the mostly weak attempt to put together ""tough"" guitar riffs from a seemingly unending stream of over used rock songs. After 45 minutes, I wondered how long until a Bon Jovi song would make an appearance. Sure enough ... when ""Dead or Alive"" chords started, it caused my biggest laugh of the evening.",Wild Hogs
15,anaconda-40658,Hog Wild.,7,15 May 2015,"Wild Hogs (2007): Dir: Walt Becker / Cast: John Travolta, Tim Allen, Martin Lawrence, William H. Macy, Ray Liotta: Entertaining comedy that touches down on the urge to be young again. John Travolta, Tim Allen, Martin Lawrence, and William H. Macy hit the road on motorcycles in a quest to live life. Travolta recently lost finances and his marriage. Allen is a workaholic dentist who feels non cool to his family. Lawrence is badgered by his wife and works a dead end job. Macy is a computer programmer afraid to approach women. Director Walt Becker has fun with the clichés with much humour mixed in as a sort of comic Easy Rider. He previously made the gross out Van Wilder but here the audience aim is much higher. Predictable elements including an encounter with a rival gang, which leads to a silly conclusion. This regards a violent showdown that is there because, rumour has it that modern audiences need such simplicity in plot solutions. Violence can be presented in a humorous manner but here it plays off corny. All four actors are quite different and come at the material with their own spin, which allows the film to appeal to an older audience. Ray Liotta is appropriate casting as the leader of the gang whom these guys tick off. It regards living life to the fullest or take time to devote to those whom are important. The result is a wild road comedy. Score: 7 / 10",Wild Hogs
16,trashgang,not funny at all,4,24 October 2018,"And so after more than 10 years from the release I finally picked this one up. It's still harder and harder to find flicks on DVD or Blu Ray and even the news papers are telling, it's over, everybody is streaming. Nevertheless I do still go the the specialised shops.You could see it coming. What do I have to say about this comedy. Great start and I even had a few smiles on my face but once the Wild Hogs come across another gang this flick goes down intio a rather boring flick. Just to pick it up at the end. I could laugh with the awkward situations going for a naked swil and a gay copper coming across the lake but overall I just sat there and waited for some good jokes or situations.Some do like this flick and for that reason I gave it a try but the only thing I really enjoyed where the landscapes. Not my cup of comedy.

17,mm-39,Decent comedy,7,27 August 2007,"Decent comedy! Wild Hogs is no 'Caddy Shack' or 'Ground Hog day', but can still hold it's own. The characters are great. John is the Alfa male, while Tim is John's counter balance, and the other two are the goof and geek of the group. A study of group sociology. The wild Hogs group has the mid life crisis theme. The Trip is full of the hit in the groin humor, and (of course) getting into trouble with a real biker gain. The movie would have been average, but the A list of actors improves 'Wild Hogs'. Well direct, where the movie has a great pace, and good music. I like the who made of shirt, nice touch. Worth renting. 7 out of 10. John really knows how to act.",Wild Hogs
18,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Wild Hogs,8,15 April 2007,"Major stars getting together for a road trip? Sounds like fun to me, and if the trailer was anything to go by, it was potential for serious laughs as middle aged men band together for some serious male bonding session while hitting the road. Wild Hogs are what Doug, Woody, Bobby and Dudley call themselves - biker dude wannabes who spend their free time mucking around a biker pub, sharing their life's woes.Doug (Tim Allen) is a dentist who gets no respect from his son and suffers from a self inflicted diet regime, Bobby (Martin Lawrence) is a henpecked househusband working in between his novel and The Firm, Dudley (William H Macy) is a geeky computer programmer who doesn't have the guts to speak to girls, and unofficial leader of the pack Woody (John Travolta) seems to have it all on the surface - riches and a Swimsuit Illustrated wife, but little does anyone know he's a bankrupt undergoing a divorce.Watching them moot the idea of a road trip on bikes - to ride hard and ride free, seemed to have rubbed off on me. If I had a bike license, hell yeah, I'd do that too with a bunch of like minded buddies, hitting the road on a trip to somewhere, a destination in mind, but absolutely zero planning on how exactly to get there. Revving those Harleys on a highway is a romantic idea, making pit stops wherever there's a need for gas, to replenish supplies or to answer nature's call.The trailer for Wild Hogs actually contained some of the best parts from the movie, and most of the good bits happen in the first half of the film. Toward the second half, you come to expect that the experience the guys go through together will have changed them for the better, though contrary to the notion of a road trip, they seem to be stuck at a single location toward the end, thus the movie started to sag both in pace and the lack of interesting happenings to spice things up.I thought watching William H Macy in a comedic role was truly refreshing, and he almost has all the best lines in the movie. Juggling the other big named actors isn't easy, and Martin Lawrence's role turned out to be the most undefined, and somehow not as interesting as the rest. John Travolta really piled on the weight here, though he showed shades of his boogie Saturday Night Live days. The supporting cast of Ray Liotta and Marisa Tomei were surprising additions, and John C McGinley's involvement would probably be the best scene in the movie, as the cop who catches our heroes in a compromising situation out in the woods, made worst by their dialogue uttered while half asleep.And if all that isn't enough, throw in Kyle Gass (Tenacious D) hamming it up with contemporary pop tunes, and a soundtrack worthy to take along during a long road trip. Wild Hogs is really fun to watch, with a somewhat sublime message of remembering to take some time off for some serious recreation and vacation. It's feel good all the way, with boys who never really quite grown up.",Wild Hogs
19,Smells_Like_Cheese,There's nothing better than watching two Oscar nominated actors on screen with two has been TV stars,6,10 September 2007,"After seeing some pretty harsh reviews on Wild Hogs, I was a bit hesitant to see the movie. But I couldn't resist, we have some awesome actors here: John Travolta, William H. Macy, Ray Liotta, Marisa Tomei, and... that's it. Well, I'm in no way criticizing Tim Allen's acting, he was actually pretty decent; I've never been a fan of Martin Lawerence, but I didn't mind him so much in the film. I watched Wild Hogs last night and I really enjoyed it. While it was a little flat in some areas, it still brought me a few laughs and I really enjoyed the characters. The story you have to admit is a fun one, just because who hasn't seen the middle aged guys trying to re-kindle their youth? So it was a blast seeing these great actors do this story together.Bobby, Dudley, Doug, and Woody are all best pals and have been since college. They have a biker gang together called the Wild Hogs, it's the one escape from their typical and predictable lives as husbands, fathers, or just being single and depressed. One day after Woody's bitter divorce and loosing his money, he suggests a road trip to re-kindle the guy's old ways. But from minute one, the trip isn't working, all the guys try to plan the trip instead of being spontaneous, they go to the bathroom every 5 minutes, and are constantly accused of being gay. Then to top things off, they meet a rival gang and Woody accidentally blows up their bar and are now being chased across the country while the boys try to be so wild.Wild Hogs is actually a fun comedy that I'm sure you'll get a few laughs from, while I was hoping for a little bit more, it still was all good. Considering that it could have flopped, I think it worked. For me I loved William H. Macy's character the most, Dudley, he was just so cute when he acted tough, it's just the whole point of it's William H. Macy. But he's awesome, so are the other actors. I would recommend Wild Hogs, it's just a fun little comedy that I'm sure you'll get a couple laughs from.6/10",Wild Hogs

On the journey ahead, they stop at a New Mexico bar, not knowing it belongs to the the mean biker gang ""Del Fuegos."" They steal a bike that belongs to the Wild Hogs, leading the four men to concoct a plan to get the bike back.Allen, Travolta, Macy and Lawrence prove that you don't always need those young punk, dude-like, eye candy guys to dominate the big screen. The Wildhogs are just about as entertaining as many of those gun-totting, property destroying action stars, or smoothing-talking, wisecracking romancers. There is a lot of cheese factor in the movie, especially in the dialog, but there is just enough comedy, drama and adventure to make this movie fast-paced and entertaining.

21,Buddy-51,Dreadul comedy,3,22 August 2007,"In ""Wild Hogs,"" four middle-aged, suburban bikers (John Travolta, Tim Allen, Martin Lawrence and William H. Macy) hit the road in a bid to recapture the free-spirited glory of their untroubled youth. While en route from Ohio to California, the group does battle with a leather-clad motorcycle gang (headed by Ray Liotta) that regularly terrorizes the small Midwestern town through which the boys are passing.Though the credits state that the screenplay was written by one Brad Copeland, we suspect that it might actually be the product of a precocious seventh-grader banging away on his personal computer while feeling his first stirrings of puberty. That might account for why every single joke seems to have originated in a junior high school locker room. With its nonstop gay-bashing and rituals of male-bonding, it's often hard to tell whether the movie is actually more homophobic or homoerotic in nature. Add to this an overabundance of genuinely uninspired slapstick routines as well as a raft of midlife crisis clichés, and you have one of the worst least-common-denominator comedies to come our way in a long time.",Wild Hogs
22,Robert_duder,"Very typical, you've seen it all but still delivers what it promises",7,25 March 2007,"Wild Hogs is going to be exactly everything you expect it to be because it never misrepresents itself as anything more or less. In fact much like other comedies 99% of the gags and funny moments are covered to extent in the trailer which is always a real let down but fortunately Wild Hogs is decent enough to hold your attention through what you've already seen in trailers. It isn't any different than what you'd expect and despite the main cast being a little odd together they manage to pull it together enough to make the film very funny...laugh out loud funny at many points.John Travolta leads the cast as down on his luck, mid life crisis-ing Woody Stevens who finds himself broke and alone and wanting to jump on his hog and go with the wind on an adventure. Travolta is back in his comedic element from his younger days and he is terrific. His character is shy, withdrawn and yet so easy to relate to and perhaps one of the more down to earth characters in the film. He should focus more on comedy, he might have a real niche left there in his future. Tim Allen is Doug Madsen, also reaching mid-life crisis, he finds himself frustrated by what he 'has' to do. Allen is of course already a great comedian and he doesn't try to do anything with this film that he isn't comfortable doing and him and Travolta have the best chemistry in the cast and are kind of the main focus. Enter the great William H. Macy, one of Hollywood's hands down best character actors as soft spoken...and well soft...Dudley Frank who wants to be able to meet and speak to a woman more than anything. Dudley is definitely the physical comedy relief as well as the softer side of the group in the film and Macy pulls that off without any problem. You wouldn't think he'd fit in with this crew but ultimately he doesn't do badly at all and actually has great chemistry with the other guys. Macy is a natural in every role he is in. And finally you have Martin Lawrence who I can't help but feel was added as the 'token black guy.' He is the one guy who just doesn't seem to fit the rest of the cast. Lawrence is far more well known for wacky comedy, loud, boisterous...Big Mama's House, Black Night, Blue Streak and as the 'straight' man in Bad Boys to Will Smith. Still Lawrence just doesn't seem to be having as good a time as the other guys. He seems younger...and is in fact a decade younger at least than the other cast members, he's not ready for a mid life crisis and it shows. He has some obligatory/typical lines and a very funny scene involving him using condiments as weapons against a couple of biker guys but overall he is under used and under played and didn't fit in. Ray Liotta is perfect in his role as their newfound arch nemesis Jack who they cross as the wrong bar and subsequently blow up their bar and have their gang after them. Liotta, who I used to not like, really does a great job of being comedic and downright mean all at once. Marisa Tomei has a decent but rather odd role as the girl that finally hooks up with Dudley. She is a little bland and just doesn't suit Macy at all but they work it out. The supporting cast for the film all do a great job and create some likable and memorable characters for the film.Wild Hogs is slapstick comedy with plenty of physical comedy, one liners, politically incorrect jokes including a long running joke about homosexuality which I thought was overused...funny the first time...old the second, third, fourth and so on. It's just funny that a director like Walt Becker who did over the top absolute gross out comedies like Van Wilder, and Buying the Cow tamed himself quite a bit to do something like this which quite frankly turned out a little stereotypical and predictable. On top of that whoever edited their trailer did an awful job of putting every single truly funny moment in the film in the trailer so that by the time you're seeing it in the theater you feel like this is the second or third time you're watching the movie which is very unfortunate because it's the funniest parts of the film!! Still Wild Hogs is a cute little comedy for adults that you can enjoy because of a great cast, a funny little story and plenty of jokes. It's a little average but worth seeing...you won't be disappointed. 7/10",Wild Hogs
23,MLDinTN,road trip for middle agers,4,20 January 2008,"This movie was not quite as bad as I thought it would be. The plot is nothing new. It's another road trip movie, this time involving 4 middle age men wanting to get away from their jobs and wives. The 4 are wanna-be bikers; thus they take off on their trip on Harleys and in leather. About the funniest part is when they meet up with a cop who thinks a meeting on the down-lo is going on and wants to join in the fun at a water hole. The group runs into trouble from a real biker gang who ends up chasing them because their bar gets blown up. The 4 end up in a small town for the night after running out of gas and here they take a stand against the bikers. It is all predictable from here.FINAL VERDICT: OK, I can't believe how well it did at the box office. It must have been released at a time nothing else was on. I wouldn't say rush out and see this, but if you are a fan of one of the lead actors, you may want to check it out.",Wild Hogs
24,tabuno,Hilarious with the nice wrap up.,8,21 January 2019,"18 August 2007. Even though there were few discontinuities, explanatory scenes left out, overall this movie is one of the more hilarious and funny movies of the year. It manages to maintain its sense of bewildering, humorous sight gags. William Macy is great, being the classic but sophisticated computer nerd while John Travolta gets to show off some of his breadth of both comedic and drama acting. This movie one of the best smooth endings into the credits and a satisfyingly decent if not completely believable twist. There is the typical macho, middle age man crises along the lines of ""City Slickers."" However, in this movie there is a better blending of home and family, interaction with the motorcycle gang Wildhogs as well as more social interaction with other characters.

27,sol-,Lost in America,5,22 May 2016,"Hoping to recapture their youth, four middle-aged suburbanites take a cross-country motorcycle trip a la 'Easy Rider' in this hit-and-miss comedy starring John Travolta, Tim Allen, Martin Lawrence and William H. Macy. The film has nothing on 'Lost in America' as far as 'Easy Rider' tributes go (despite an entertaining Peter Fonda cameo) and it has relatively little to offer as a midlife crisis movie, but there is enough of interest here that the film seldom ever bores. The jokes are not particularly fresh or original with Macy constantly driving into things, a noticeably large amount of gay-themed gags and unfunny fight sequences, but the supporting cast is great (especially an aggressive Ray Liotta and John C. McGinley as a cop who seems unable to leave the foursome alone) and there are at least two genuinely funny moments as Macy's computer goes berserk and as Travolta cites the backwoods horror film 'Deliverance' when trying to think of a movie that their cross-country trip might be like! The film also deserves some credit for assembling a perfect sourced song soundtrack without falling back on the obvious (i.e. ""Born to Be Wild""). 'Wild Hogs' is, however, a difficult movie to enthusiastically recommend overall. There is a convenient love interest for the lovesick Macy, a sentimental end credits scene, a goofy antagonist or two, some mindless violence and an incredulous deus ex machina in the mix. Then again, there are also several amusing moments when the filmmakers trust the four friends simply interact and bounce off each other.",Wild Hogs
28,Floated2,terribly written and bad direction,2,3 September 2010,"""Wild Hogs"" is a movie about four middle-aged men who are either bored with their lives or are desperate for a change. They decide to ride across the country on motorcycles, even though one of them, Dudley Frank (William H. Macy) is such an incompetent rider he should be banned from the road. John Travolta, playing Woody Stevens, a successful guy gone broke. Martin Lawrence plays henpecked husband Bobby Davis, and Tim Allen plays Doug Madsen, a dentist suffering from mid-life crisis.As the Wild Hogs set off in search of America, they accidentally cross swords with a tough biker guy named Jack (Ray Liotta) and his gang of toughs called the Del Fuegos. A confrontation puts the Wild Hogs on the run with the Del Fuegos in hot pursuit, even though only Woody knows they are being pursued. Why he keeps this a secret when his very life depends on him telling the truth is just one of the many head-scratching plot holes. The Hogs run out of fuel near a small town and are forced to spend the night. They become local heroes by standing up to a couple of toughs from the Del Fuego biker gang, but a day of reckoning is dawning when the rest of the gang shows up for some payback.The attempt to mix drama, comedy, romance, action and some sort of strange biker code into a cohesive whole doesn't really work all that well. The clumsy humor is confined mainly to below-the-belt areas. It is mostly safe humor that won't offend any group of people with any real political power. Scenes like the group swimming nude in a pool, their tent burning down while camping, them being attacked by a bull, them throwing away their phone in the beginning in order to feel free, etc. Also, I don't see people find this movie funny, and exactly what they laughed at. I didn't laugh once, I may have cracked a smile at John Travolta's ""stoned"" looked of the introduction of the Del Fuegos, and that large man singing a few songs at the carnival.",Wild Hogs

However, once it gets going (and it does so quite quickly), the differences are quite glaring...in a good way.Having been involved in the world demonstrated here, I have to say that I began this movie with little expectations of anything learned, and anticipated nothing but entertainment. Fluff. And, for the most part, that's what I got-top notch entertainments, and true heart-felt belly laughs. I was happy with that.But the ending of this movie, with an appearance of Peter Fonda and the words uttered by this icon, were beautiful. They reminded me of the credo I was taught at the knees of Tiny and Gangrene from Phoenix, AZ. They reminded me that there is a VAST difference between a Scooter Tramp and Scooter Trash. They reminded me that unity and a sense of family were always more important than the gang-like mentalities demonstrated by many trash groups who never actually rode anywhere beyond the local bar. The older ""long-hairs"" are mainly the ones who will best remember the ideologies about which I am speaking, and I must say that this movie actually touched many of them with pride, as I was looking around the darkened theater.I left the theater feeling oddly uplifted, and realized that word of mouth is what drew all those older bikers into a crowded small town theater on a Tuesday night (definitely NOT the norm for our home town theater).Even if you're not of the lifestyle featured in this work, if you life your life in a responsible manner, you will still find these performances hilarious, while slickly identifying with the characters involved. The visuals are wonderful, and the camera angles were totally creative.I thoroughly enjoyed this ""surprise hit,"" and recommend anyone looking for a few good laughs to give it a chance.It rates an 8.8/10 from...the Fiend :.",Wild Hogs

The movie's premise is weak, four middle aged guys who are seeking fulfillment by ""hitting the road,"" but that's okay because this movie is a comedy created to inspire laughter, which it does. The movie is unpretentious. If you are looking for a serious dramatic story with an esoteric message full of subliminal meanings and delicate nuances, then this is the wrong movie for you.

John Travolta, Martin Lawrence, William H. Macy, Ray liotta, and Marisa Tomei are all good in their roles. The chemistry between all the guys in the movie works, which is good because without that the film as a whole would pretty much fail. Ray Liotta is a good jackass character, he always is lol. And Marisa Tomei is cute and light in her role, that's really all she needs to be for her character. There are some scenes that are fairly funny and will get the laughs, then there are some gags that fall flat and don't really work. Thankfully though when the comedy that doesn't work happens the actors are still likable enough to keep you from quitting on it. That is all comedy films have to rely on when their jokes don't succeed. I liked the script, it had some really sweet heartfelt scenes between characters, whether it be just friendly or in a romantic sense. The movie is an average comedy movie about a group of older friends who want to ""relive the glory days"". There aren't a whole lot of twists and turns involved. 7/10 for Wild Hogs.",Wild Hogs

While these bikers are trying to find ""Wild Hogs"" and getting their revenge.Directed by Walt Becker (National Lampoon's Van Wilder) made an enjoyable, familiar road trip with some genuine laughs and good comedic performances by the four leads. This film is quite memorable thanks to the cast and Middle aged humor is surprisingly pleasant as well. This was one of the biggest hits of 2007. Which is certainly the highest grossing film for Allen and Lawrence. Travolta, who's hasn't had a big hit since ""Face/Off"". Allen makes an good comedic return after his three not so good films of 2006. Liotta might seems oddly cast as a low-life biker at first but he has some good moments in the movie. Tomei is a delight as Macy's love interest.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an good Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound. DVD has an decent commentary track by the director and screenwriter:Brad Copeland, Deleted Scenes/Alternative Ending with optional commentary, Outtakes and more. DVD's features are somewhat disappointing. I was expecting longer featurette of the film and more outtakes. Which some of the funnier outtakes did appear on ""Oprah"". Which it was an extremely funner segment on ""Oprah"". When Allen, Travolta, Lawrence and Macy appeared on the show to promote their film. Maybe on a future DVD, it would be cool if that ""Oprah"" segment did appeared on a new Special Edition DVD someday The highlight of ""Wild Hogs"" is the amusing cameos by John C. McGinley as a flirty homosexual motorcycle patrol cop, Kyle Gass as a hilarious singer at the Chili Festival, a neat one from Peter Fonda near the end and of course, Macy (Who's steals the show with his droll performance). There's also an funny surprise at the end credits. Overall ""Wild Hogs"" isn't the best comedy out-there but it's certainly one of the funniest and light hearted comedy in recent memory. Super 35.

Johh Travolta plays totally against type as the whiniest of the bunch, and he is just dreadful. Martin Lawrence is not in his element here, so he is forgiven. Tim Allen is wasted, as he does not play well in this ensemble piece (although he did just fine in another ensemble flick, Galaxy Quest). And William Macy clearly was in it for the paycheck. He plays a mouse turned man, and ends up wrapped up in duct tape for one of the movie's worst scenes. He also gets to react to volcano-like chili. Big laughs. Not. Ray Liotta as the head of the biker gang is not the Ray Liotta we have come to know and love from dozens of hard-edged movies. Here, he plays a caricature of himself, with a loud bark but no bite.

Jack and his buddies do not like middle-class suburbanites -amateur bikers, and a lot of misadventures ensue as the result of their meeting.I think the movie is better than majority of critics giving it credit for. The soundtrack contains classic rock songs. Along with the ""Wild Hogs"" gang we would pass and enjoy the beautiful scenery on the way from Ohio to the Pacific coast. The movie has even a class act in the end when the obligatory Deus ex machine shows up in the small charming town Madrid, New Mexico to settle all the scores and to stop the war between Wild Hogs and Del Fuegos. Peter Fonda's appearance immediately brings to mind another cross-country motorcycle adventure that happened almost forty years ago.I would not stay in line to the theater to see this comedy there, and I did not even know when it was released. One of my husband's coworkers, a biker himself who liked the movie, gave us the DVD which we watched on Saturday night and had a good time.

One wonders why they decided to do the movie in the first place. The story line itself is plausible but no one bothered to write funny lines and simply let the stunt gods have their way with really bad slap-stick stuff (I won't use the word humor). Either that or the stunt gods were intimidated by the main stars and knowing their stature, that seems most likely. No one was in charge and that is evident when you watch the entire movie. I watched it to the very end in the hopes there would be something humorous or at the very least something to save itself. Did it? No. Apparently, comedy is a lot harder than the 4-friends contemplated it would be. Next time read the script guys, and make changes necessary. Either that or just say NO. Violence: Yes.

It is full of famous actors, too, what caught my attention when I saw the DVD cover.I think it was very funny to see the four men trying to recuperate their shape of when they were young bikers, as well as having a lot of problems with the younger new generation's bikers, who are much more crazy then they were before.If you want something ''light'' and easy to watch to pass the time, this movie is a nice recommendation for you.",Wild Hogs

OK not exactly high concept - but it could have worked What a horrible mess - really. A fantastic cast that is just horribly used. The fact that THREE of the lead actors appeared on the Leno Show is a sure indicator something needs selling - but oh dear...It all ambles along, but it is with a huge sense of predictability, and the comedy is just horrible.There's only one thing monumentally wrong with Wild Hogs: it just ain't funny. It also looks as though it was made in 1983 - it is amazingly dated. It looks and feels like City Slickers, without the charm of Billy Crystal (And let's face it...) Sure, it is harmless enough - in fact too harmless - the script and editing for my taste are really TV quality - you'll see better film making in Heroes or Entourage, at least an attempt to say something with the celluloid - and the performances are all sooooo predictable.It tries to manufacture a mid-west charm in the little town of Madrid but it feels rushed throughout - quickly made and quickly thought through.Hugely disappointing - what a shame! Given the talent on display they have made a film that is just so clichéd, and flat, and well, simple. About OK to rent, but will come around every year on TV so you might as well wait - you won't regret it, Wild Hogs does nobody any favors, and has all the flavor and delight of 3 month old roadkill....",Wild Hogs

To be totally fair it is down to the writing that the actors fail.The comedy genre has changed over the years and recent flops such as Disaster Movie give a testament to what comedy is; slapstick and parody of current issues and celebrities. The slapstick humour comes thick and fast from the get go as Macy's character Dudley crashes his Harley, portrayed as being funny when it could have been quite serious in a real sense and the slapstick and predictability continues as the plot unravels in a sad and desperate manor.We are introduced one by one into the character's dismal and difficult lives, all conveniently looking for an excuse to get away at the exact same time. Travolta's desperate and inspirational speech to convince his friends to come on the trip had me turning away it was so clichéd inspirational, with that atrocious cheesy music spurring in the background.From there we see plenty of stereotypes such as the hard nut bikers and a gay cop who is played by John C McGinley of Scrubs, and being a huge fan of Dr Cox I was ashamed to watch, like other parts of the film.The one and only good thing about this film is the directed sequences of the bikers on the open road, cruising down highways with some chilled music playing.Bad performances and exceptionally poor writing, wild hogs follows the current trend of comic convention and doesn't live up to every biker's fantasy",Wild Hogs

Woody (Travolta) is running away from his financial and relationship woes; Doug (Allen) wants to recapture his youth; Bobby (Lawrence) needs to escape an overbearing wife; and Dudley who ...well ...just wants to go and learn how to ride without ending up on the pavement.The open road beckons with all of its coolness. This includes bug splatter, bird attacks, heavy rains, an overtly gay highway patrolman (John C. McGinley of SCRUBS fame), and a real band of roughshod bikers collectively called the Del Fuegos. When our unsuspecting foursome enters the Del Fuegos bar, terrible things begin to brew. The Wild Hogs (as their leather jackets proudly announce) are in trouble. Jack (Ray Liotta, SMOKIN' ACES) is the leader of the Del Fuegos and summarily steals Dudley's bike. Woody (Travolta) becomes incensed and sneaks back to the biker bar and steals back Dudley's ride, but in the process accidentally blows up the Del Fuego's watering hole.The rest of the film is dedicated to Frank and his Del Fuego brothers tracking down the Wild Hogs in preparation for extermination.Meanwhile, our four Harley riders hold up in a small town that annually gets terrorized by the Del Fuegos. But once the bad guys learn where the Wild Hogs are hiding, Frank and his gang head into town prepared to do whatever it takes to eliminate them.It is the love interest of Dudley that sparks revolt within the town. Maggie (Marisa Tomei, FACTOTUM) is the owner of a small diner and when the Del Fuegos threaten to burn it down, Dudley steps up to meet the dastardly villains (dun! dun! dun!). With their friend in mortal danger, the remaining Wild Hogs come out of hiding to help protect their biker brother.It is only through the intervention of one man that everything eventually works itself out, allowing our group of 'Easy Riders' a smooth exit.Although funny in spots (a vulture following the Wild Hogs while they're forced to push their bikes, William H. Macy's many crashes, the advances of the homosexual cop), the predictability of everything and the limited laughs didn't warrant a positive rating.I would've liked to have seen more substance and/or laughs via Allen, Lawrence, and Travolta, but they seemed static against the ever-moving Macy who steals every scene he's in.",Wild Hogs

There is no doubt that the film is scattered with some funny moments, but it's a shame there aren't more of them. The story follows a group of middle aged guys crossing the country on bikes to rediscover there lost youth.The cast includes Allen, Travolta, Lawrence, Macy, Liotta and Tomei, so you've got to look at the director (Becker) and script writer (Copeland) for why it isn't better. Most of the funnier moments are reserved for Dudley (Macy) although it stretches the imagination to see him hitting it off with Maggie (Tomei).",Wild Hogs
50,jpschapira,Embarrassment...,3,16 April 2007,"Believe me: in the world we're living in, at this time; if you see the face of Tim Allen at the beginning of a film, something's wrong. Honestly, I can't remember the last good movie the actor was in, and when I remember one, it's not even good; it's regular. Personally, I've come to a point where I don't even bother to see his films. To understand this whole statement, maybe you should watch ""Wild Hogs"", when it's still a dreadful experience. The only reason why a film like this one does so well in the box office is because of the stars. Alongside Allen, an all-star cast of consistent and inconsistent names portray the 'hogs'. Casually, their characters need to remember the good life, as so do they. In a clear and sad relationship of film and reality that may sound harsh, the 'wild hogs' go on a trip need less stress and more fun; the actors play the characters because they need less respect and apparently more paychecks. Take Martin Lawrence, for starters. I love the guy and I wanted to see him back on screen, but he made his last good film a long time ago, when he was still funny. You'll be surprised by how unfunny he is in this picture; if you think about the guy I'm talking about. John Travolta is also in for the ride and although I think he doesn't care which role he plays anymore and that he lost credibility at the end of last decade, he has reached the lowest level; and yet he's the best of the four main characters, trying very hard to steal the show.I was very intrigued by the name of William H. Macy among the cast; he's always doing interesting independent films and I think of him as a fine character actor. He must have been desperate to do this, but I thought I was going to watch 'him' stealing the show. He didn't, and Ray Liotta couldn't do it, shouting a lot and making a fool out of himself. Actually, it was Marisa Tomei who did that, looking beautiful and being talented as always in a very short appearance. The writer Brad Copeland only got it right with the love relationship between her and Macy. The rest was unbelievable and it had me counting the parts which were not funnyI got tired of it, because the script repeated the same joke over and over again and when it didn't do that, it used old jokes that don't work anymore. The first scenes were montages of each of the main characters' boring lives, with at least two jokes in every one of them. Seriously, not even one was funny.And the direction is so misguided. Walt Becker thought he could do a lot of genres in one film, so he created little cheesy dramatic parts and, read this, he made a building blow up which couldn't seem more out of place. He was also very wrong in giving Teddy Castellucci's score so much space; it was sometimes louder than the actors' voices and it didn't help the mood of the film. There are some actors to who we allow to play roles like these (Kurt Russel is the best example), because they're also doing great performances in good films. I wonder why these films keep making it to the big screen and I know why these actors do themI think they should be embarrassed.",Wild Hogs
51,DonFishies,"A few momentary funny lines, but not much else by way of redeeming qualities",2,10 December 2007,"I wanted to enjoy Wild Hogs. Really.Despite the film's near astronomical box office take (and currently sitting in the top ten highest grossing films of the year), I heard very little by way of good things about the film. And in watching it, I can see why.Wild Hogs chronicles the story of four middle-aged friends (played by John Travolta, Tim Allen, Martin Lawrence and William H. Macy) who ride motorcycles together and sure enough, call their ""gang"" the Wild Hogs. Feeling like they neglected truly living, the group decide to go on a cross-country adventure to the Pacific coast, but as movie clichés would have it, they run into a little bit of trouble along the way from ""real bikers"".It is almost unfair to criticize a movie like this, because it seems right from the start that it was thrown together specifically for the reason of getting a bit of star-power together and turning a quick profit.There is no care taking with any of the main, or even the supporting, characters backstories at all. I listened carefully for the entirety of the movie waiting to find out how these four guys know each other, but nothing is ever said. They all just seem to be four seemingly innocuous middle-aged losers who met up at one point in their lives, and decided to pursue their love for motorcycles. There is no other way to explain them. And even when some of their motivations for the trip or even for their putrid lives is mentioned, that is about all that happens. It is never explored, it is never used in any real way to benefit the film. Yes, their friendship is exploited, and Macy's seemingly impossible tactics with women, but only for the point of moving the story from point to point, never to make reasoning out of why these characters are the way they are. And anyone who shows up as a supporting character, no matter how small, seem to be there purely as leverage for the one-dimensional leads.And the actual dialogue and story are not a whole lot better. Yes, I did smirk a few times, but not a lot. Instead, when the movie was not focusing on the latent, and near offensive homophobia of the leads (even throwing in a stereotypical, truly unfunny minor character like John C. McGinley's Highway Patrolman who follows the characters for the first half of the film, and then drops off the map entirely), it was attempting to crack jokes that just are not funny. Maybe I needed to be a biker, or maybe an old guy to get some of them, but if that is the key audience the filmmakers are going for, then I think they need to re-evaluate their marketing strategies. When the jokes are not falling flat, the actual dialogue that passes is about as wooden as it comes. It is just plain terrible in most cases, and I think I threw up a little in my mouth when some of the lines came off as attempts at poetic credibility.What's worse is that the leads just do not seem to be giving it their all. I realize Lawrence has really not given us much by way of half-decency since Bad Boys II, and even before that is a little sketchy, and I know Allen has never really gotten out of the rut of half baked Disney or family movies, and that Travolta has almost lost the entirety of his street credibility as a great actor, but Macy still has some juice left in him. Why is he even bothering with unimaginative and spotty filth like this? Has he really lost all sense of the greatness he once had? At least he makes a minor attempt at really acting, everyone else seems lost in unenthusiasm and longing for the old days. I could almost tell that Travolta was crying inside, truly realizing that he is really steering towards rock bottom. But even with that, he still delivers an uncalculated and almost unwatchable performance. Unless you remember seeing him as Tony Manero or Vincent Vega, he is near unrecognizable. Allen and Lawrence, well, they could just use some time off to rethink their career decisions, and either come back for roles that will actually challenge them and showcase their gifts as comedians, or just go into retirement, because movies and acting like this is not doing much of anything for them.None of the recognizable supporting characters, from Jill Hennessy to M.C. Gainey to even Oscar-winner Marisa Tomei (yes, I realize that means almost nothing), do anything really worthwhile here. Ray Liotta is minorly amusing as the leader of the ""real biker gang"", the Del Fuegos, but his overacting only speaks to the fact that his lines are just atrociously written. Even the ridiculous and unrealistic ending speaks volumes of how badly written his character was. Liotta seems in on the fact that his role is horrendous too sadly, but does nothing to make it even attempt to be worthwhile.There is really nothing to even remotely make Wild Hogs watchable. Yes, it has a few laughs and a cringe-worthy but awesome cameo near the end, but other than that, the film only stands as a quarterly-baked idea that misses any of the points it is attempting to address. And when the filmmakers may have struck an idea they could potentially mine, they just throw it away and leave it uselessly hanging about. I do not even think they could possibly make this film any better, they were better off just scrapping it and looking for a new idea. How this movie made any money, much less almost 170 million dollars, is beyond me.2/10.",Wild Hogs
52,joachimokeefe,The first fifteen minutes are enjoyable.,1,23 May 2020,"Yes, there are some real l-o-l gags at the beginning, mainly thanks to William H Macy's comic timing, and some sharp family conflict gags that don't pull punches. But.Tim Allen, as a dentist, convincingly conveys middle-aged depression and weight gain, and has a hot wife. Martin Lawrence is pretty funny doing the blue-collar black man bit, as you might expect (and has a hot wife). Then John Travolta turns up, and his comic timing is off. Not as bad as Amy Schumer's, but off. Never anticipate the laugh, John.Travolta was great in Pulp Fiction, for example, because the character was supposed to be a cocaine-addled idiot. In this he's supposed to be the most hip member of a group of depressed middle-aged men whose hobby is motorcycles. In my experience, groups of depressed middle-aged men tend to mock, victimise and reject narcissistic idiots, but this group elects him leader.After 20 minutes, trying to adjust to Travolta's self-conscious performance is like trying to watch a film with the sound out of sync. Wild Hogs soon runs out of road and does a pratfall into a self-regarding heap of humourless Hollywood ho-hum.",Wild Hogs
53,rajdoctor,Wild Hogs,6,14 April 2007,"Wild Hogs I had read horrible reviews about the movie. I had also seen the trailer  which I was not impressed with. I had gone to see the movie Shooter but the timing was incorrect  and with no other movies running  I had only one option to go and see this movie for which I had bottom low expectations. With a big BOREDOM on my face I sat in the movie hall to kill my time.The story is about four (above) middle-aged men  William Macy, John Travolta, Tim Allen and Martin Lawrence who has some sort of crisis in their lives; to get over that they plan a wannabe biker road trip across US to Pacific coast. On the way they manage to blow up a pub of highway biker gang, who chase them for revenge. The four protagonists for a while settle down in a town where the last action takes place.It is a comedy movie, and I enjoyed it. I think the movie was funny and likable  except the lame ending. I love William Macy and he has played his role very well, but the nuances of comedy has been picked up great by John Travolta who shows desperation to run away from the biker gang. Tim Allen and Martin Lawrence are also good in their roles. There are moments where the movie gives a good laugh and I found all the audience around me utterly enjoying this cross country ride  with these four buffoons.If you have a group of friends, and want to go for a light, laughing, funny movie  go for this.

55,diac228,"Its no American Beauty or Sideways in terms of the middle-aged crisis theme. Then again, that is a good thing....",8,2 March 2007,"To compare Wild Hogs to comedic greats and classic movies about mid-life crisis would be absolutely foolish. Sitting back and enjoying the wild ride is your best choice in getting the full enjoyment out of this flick. Containing a diverse cast that works quite well, a handful of funny cameos, tons of predictable yet enjoyable scenarios, and a rather surprising amount of physical humor; Wild Hogs is a startlingly delightful comedy that isn't afraid to reach low for a laugh. Coming off as more than just a guilty pleasure, we have good acting running the show, as our longtime cinema veterans mesh together and bring out their best comedic skills to deliver a nice trip through the United States.Wild Hogs follows four middle-aged men losing excitement (among other things) in their daily aspects of life. Doug (Tim Allen) isn't the fun guy he used to be, Bobby (Martin Lawrence) is not able to run his own home, Woody (John Travolta) has lost pretty much everything, and Dudley (William H. Macy) has nothing to begin with. The four of them decide to take their boring lives out for a spin, and try to relive the glory days of college-- ride off in their motorbikes across the country. The main conflict is whether or not they can unleash the Wild Hogs in them and be able to reach California in one piece. The other problem arises when the well-known tough biker gang Del Fuegos crosses paths with them.The premise is something we've all seen before, yet it can still be done well with the right group of people. Mixing John Travolta, Martin Lawrence, Tim Allen, and William H. Macy is something that truly would not, and could not have been predicted by anybody. Nonetheless, this unique quartet does a fantastic job. Not one actor is overused or overacting, and we see each of the actors' talents brought to life. Tim Allen puts his physical humor to the test and succeeds. John Travolta brings his comedic chops and also is shockingly hilarious. Martin Lawrence has his good movies (Nothing to Lose) and his really bad movies (Black Night, Big Momma's House 2) but in here, he doesn't go too far, doesn't attempt too hard, and holds his own as the uncertain Bobby. Topping them all is William H. Macy, whose physical comedy tops all the others in this movie. Rounding out the cast is an assortment of cameos and short roles that despite being good were quite underused (Marisa Tomei, Stephen Tobolowsky, Ray Liotta, John C. McGinley, Peter Fonda).The laughs in here are present pretty much throughout the film, and it ranges from funny little one-liners, to physical comedy, to lowbrow comedy, to even a bit of absurdity. A bit of it is predictable, yet some of it comes flying out of nowhere (literally and figuratively). We have a nice bit of cinematography to capture some of it, including a nice shot of ""death"" taking a liking to William H. Macy and a brilliant game of ""Bullslapping."" The director, Walt Becker, knows better and lets the camera roll and the actors take control of what is going on. He was fortunate enough to capture the fun and silliness with little effort.We don't have Oscar material in the least bit, but we have material that will spark laughing riots from the audience time and time again. Like most decent comedies of this decade, its best not to be taken seriously, because analyzing and nitpicking would distract from the overall experience. Like what the characters in the film originally wanted; it was a trip with no rules, no barriers, and no remorse. Wild Hogs does just that; it was a raw, strong PG-13 ride with the violence, sex, profanity, and look-away moments that anyone on the open road would witness. Also supporting this movie is a nice soundtrack, cleverly adding some good Southern rock, Bon Jovi, AC/DC, and even White Zombie. Try to catch some subtle Disney humor involving the actors and character's names.Bottom Line: So what if the script isn't groundbreaking? So what if the direction didn't enhance anything? So what if the story became a bit predictable? We have four veteran actors making fools of themselves for almost two hours on the open road, and with very little time in between potential laughs. It was just pure popcorn entertainment, and isn't that what you want on a Friday night? Wild Hogs will not inspire you to do something, but it will inspire some conversations and maybe even a second viewing. Besides, it is rare to see Tim Allen and Martin Lawrence provide a slew of funny moments. While this movie could have benefited from fewer clichés and more unpredictability, it stands tall as the first good comedy of 2007.",Wild Hogs

Well however the movie scores as a 'real good comedy' which happens to be rare these days.

Hilarity ensues when each bumbling character faces a challenge that addresses each of their fears, especially when they meet a rough biker gang in New Mexico headed by ultimate bad biker (Ray Liotta).The movie was quite long but you will allow it if you are just in the mood for laughs. The laughs come especially if you are able to relate to the characters' situations. Tim Allen plays Doug Madsen, reportedly a daredevil in his teens but grows up to become a dentist who has played it safe ever since he got married with kids. John Travolta plays Woody Stevens, the supposedly successful guy who has it all, but is actually hiding a divorce from his supermodel wife and his bankrupt status. Martin Lawrence plays Bobby Davis, the henpecked husband who doesn't bring home the bacon. The best performance for me was from William H. Macy as Dudley Frank, the quintessential geek.It was refreshing to see Macy play this character because he really pulled it off and it was such a welcome change from his honest cop roles. A little dance sequence was once more milked out of Travolta, who also played his role quite well (his face looked like he gets Botoxed regularly!). Marisa Tomei was a nice surprise. She plays Maggy, the owner of the small town diner the gang visits.

It is a hilarious take on the lives of four guys in their mid to late forties who begin to wonder what has happened to their lives. Some did well and lost it all, others are stuck with boring lives wondering if they should have done something different. The guys have their own little biker club (""We're not a gang"") and they are content to putt around close to home until one day......... one of them says, ""Let's put some real miles on those bikes."" He wants to take a long rode trip from Ohio to the Pacific ocean. A big decision for guys who never ventured more than 100 miles from home on their rumbling Harleys. Most folks are honest enough to admit Harleys sound great. The guys have genuine Harleys and wear the leather and look like bikers, but they secretly know they are just average guys with average lives. The reluctant ones of the bunch decide to go along a bit hesitantly and the fun begins. Lots of sight gags, subtle humor, and some good old fashioned goof ups provide a lot of laughs. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie because I could identify with it to some extent. ""Tooltime"" Tim Taylor is a riot as a guy flipping out, sick of his ""lettuce diet"". He chokes down meat and gravy and potatoes like a wolf, with hilarious results. Bill Macy manages to wreck a couple bikes and survive. Martin Lawrence has a whole bunch of great lines and John Travolta does his share of antics. You won't guess it but at least two of the guys didn't ride well at all before the movie was made. Guess which two? They had to be taught how to ride by stunt men. Each of the actors gets a chance to stretch their talent in their own way. There were numerous laughs in this movie. I recommend the DVD. Watch the special features for the making of the movie. It is almost as good as the movie and shows how the finished movie had a lot more in it than the original script.

65,brian_r_wright,A funloving romp to lighten up with,6,28 March 2007,"Wild Hogs is a no brainer. Well, that sounds harsher than intended: What I mean is not that it takes very little gray matter to appreciate the movie (which is true), rather that the movie provides a splash of hopeful spring tonic for the schtick that lays so heavily on the minds of conscientious citizens in late winter, 2007. ###The plot involves a group of middle-class guys who ride hogs (Harley-Davidson motorcycles) together occasionally on the weekends. Each of them has his own professional challenges and problems at home:  Doug (Tim Allen) is a successful dentist who used to be a happy-go-lucky free spirit, but settled into a routine life in suburbia with his college-sweetheart wife (Jill Hennessy) and a boy who won't play catch with him. Woody (John Travolta) is an attorney who's been dumped by his supermodel wife and has money problems. He becomes the instigator. Bobby (Martin Lawrence) under pressure of his wife, who is on the henpecking side, feels he must abandon his year-long leave of absence from his job at the firm to write a book. His real job is cleaning toilets for The Firm. Dudley (William Macy) is a nerdish computer programmer who's effeminate but not gay. A lot of the better lines, and arguably the better acting, come from Dudley, as for example when he inquires at the notorious, raunchy Del Fuego biker bar something to the effect of whether he can get whipped cream with his latte. I think Dudley makes the movie. But first things first. The four Wild Hogs meet in their customary suburban tavern, supposedly in Cincinnati but it looks like southern California to me. Woody challenges their manhood and appeals to their sense of adventure, ""Let's take a wild road trip to California before we get too old to do it."" My Velda bailed out of our double date for this movie based on reviews on Rotten Tomatoes. Their critics panned it at a rate of 4 to 1. (Yet 70% of viewing audiences liked it.) Judging from the negative commentsmainly that the humor was over-the-top gay and crotch jokesI was prepared to be disappointed. But I needed a laugh.The rest of the plot is predictable. They have some funny incidents (yes, there's some gay-related humor but it's not a focus of the movie). They get in trouble with a bad biker gang, hole up in a small New Mexico town which allows the only single man, Macy's character, to hook up with a charming maiden, Maggie (Marisa Tomei (hubba hubba)). They finally get out of trouble with the Del Fuego bikers, whose leader is played with the correct level of menace for a comedy, by Ray Liotta. And reach their destination, ultimately winding up resolving the issues they had, or at least a good share of them....For my complete review of this movie and for other movie and book reviews, please visit my site TheCoffeeCoaster.com.Brian Wright Copyright 2007",Wild Hogs
66,Benjamin_Cox,Daft low-bro comedy - 58%,5,15 April 2007,"Counting the days until I leave London (and a reliable net connection!) behind for good, I feel my days of movie reviewing could be coming to an end. A pity because it means that watching a real clunker of a movie isn't a totally wasted opportunity. However, if my last few movies are as enjoyable as this road movie comedy, then leaving it behind will be even harder. I am so glad because this struck me as being one of those films that are better in the trailer than they are in the cinema. But it isn't - this is a movie with genuine laughs and a real sense of fun although it never succeeds in being anything else other than fluff. Think of ""Smokey & The Bandit"" but on two wheels and you get the idea...""Wild Hogs"" is the name of an informal bunch of losers based in suburban Cincinatti. Doug (Tim Allen) is a failed dentist who doesn't bond with his son, Woody (John Travolta) is going through a messy divorce with his model wife, Bobby (Martin Lawrence) is constantly hen-pecked by his hyper-aggressive wife while techno-geek Dudley (William H Macy) would be quite happy to have a wife to tear him away from his precious laptop. When Woody suggests a road-trip on their bikes to the Pacific coast, the gang agree to leave behind their dreary lives and head to sunny California. But they run into trouble in New Mexico when they lock horns with the Del Fuegos, led by sneering meanie Jack (Ray Liotta).Given that there isn't really much of a plot behind ""Wild Hogs"", it's a real testament to the cast and script that this is such a gem of a comedy. The four leads spark off each other brilliantly well, as though they have been doing this sort of stuff for years. I will say that Travolta and Liotta aren't known for their comic roles and both of them slightly disappoint against the more established comic actors. Macy simply acts everyone else off screen as the delightful nerd who gets tongue-tied at the mere sight of Maggie (Marisa Tomei). It's not deep or unnecessarily crude but it concentrates on good comedy and this is certainly a good comedy filled with cheap laughs. It also looks good with sweeping desert landscapes and yes, shiny Harleys (if you like that sort of thing, of course). Cracking soundtrack as well and it's not often I complement a film's soundtrack.I have recently been let-down by films that were hyped up to glory and ultimately proved disappointing. But nothing restores faith quicker than an unexpected surprise and ""Wild Hogs"" is a delightfully funny and silly film that I can honestly recommend to anyone. Well, maybe a bit too much swearing for the very young and very old but everyone in between will enjoy this film. Ignore Travolta trying too hard for laughs and Liotta hamming it up. Just put your feet up and enjoy a film that simply offers lots of laughs without too many distractions. Saddle up and enjoy the ride! Just don't expect too much!",Wild Hogs
67,Tenchi64589,Truly funny,9,13 March 2007,"This has to be one of the best comedies I've seen since Harold and Kumar Go to White Castle... and that's saying something.I haven't laughed like that in years, the way that everything came together was just perfect.As always, Ray Liota does an excellent job as the main villain, and it's been ages since Tim Allen made a GOOD movie.This movie is a refreshing change from most films that you have to be a genius to analyze and enjoy.The only thing that really bothered me was the predictable sit-through ending... other than that, this is a movie everyone will love.9/10",Wild Hogs
68,pepekwa,unfunny,2,16 January 2008,"Great cast, good rating on IMDb, road trip comedy, I thought this would be a fun movie. Unfortunately, this was a patently unfunny waste of ninety minutes although to be fair I didn't waste that much time on it as I was fast-forwarding with subtitles on after thirty minutes to get my money's worth and find out how the drivel would end. It really beats me how people would find this hysterically funny, they must be twelve or got very drunk before watching it. John Travolta can't do comedy, Tim Allen hasn't been funny in fifteen years and Martin Lawrence is only funny when he dresses up as a 350 pound woman, mind you they weren't helped by the weakest of scripts and little in the way of directorial talent. Ray Liotta was completely mis-cast as a lead biker and the rest of his rabble didn't look in the slightest bit intimidating. The whole stand-off scene at the end lacked any credibility whatsoever and was really tamely done. Even Marisa Tomei's liaison with William H Macy was contrived and like everything else in the movie, failed to convince at all. And I'm not even mentioning the goofy local law enforcement who tried hard with the material but again, failed to hit any funny bone. A couple of saving graces in the movie were John Mcginley as a gay, adventurous cop and William H Macy as the nerdy ""Wild Hog"", he had a couple of good one liners and played the role of the geek with no pretensions well. Otherwise though, this was a major disappointment, it was woefully unfunny from start to finish and a threadbare plot with tons of holes and a woeful, lame ending meant this sunk without trace. There are far better comedies than this out there, give this one a very wide berth.",Wild Hogs
69,pswanson00,City Slickers on Harleys,7,20 August 2007,"Wild Hogs is predictable, derivative, and pretty funny. I've been riding motorcycles for 41 years and know that, even as RUBs (Rich Urban Bikers) go, these characters are not realistic. It doesn't matter, because it's obvious that the cast members were having so much fun making this film that I couldn't help wanting to join them in the hilarity. When they got to New Mexico I said to my wife, ""They should use a location or scene from Easy Rider, as kind of a nod to history."" I had to wait until the end, but the appearance of Peter Fonda as the bikers' patriarch was worth the wait, and extremely funny to those of us who remember when Easy Rider was a new movie. His advising the Hogs to throw away their watches came straight from an early scene in Easy Rider, for those who aren't familiar with that film.I also loved Marisa Tomei as Maggie, and wonder why she was barely mentioned in the DVD Director's Commentary. I mean, she's Marisa Freakin' Tomei! I agree with the author of another comment, who is jealous of William Macy's getting to kiss her. That would be a welcome retake! Wild Hogs is good distraction-style entertainment, containing no social message, and is just the ticket for relaxing after a stressful day.",Wild Hogs
70,guyfromjerzee,"""Wild Hogs"" a fitting title...for this steaming pile of pig slop",3,4 March 2007,"Another brutally lame comedy. What a surprise! Not only is it lame, but it wastes the talents of four good performers: John Travolta, William H. Macy, Tim Allen, and Martin Lawrence. OK, so Allen and Lawrence are no strangers to lame-brained comedies. Both are fine comic actors, but the two of them don't exactly possess the best judgment in choosing scripts. Travolta has done some clunkers in the past, but this is probably one of his worst. ""Wild Hogs"" makes ""Be Cool"" look like a Shakesperean drama. I was especially annoyed watching the brilliant, Oscar-nominated actor William H. Macy in this poor excuse for a comedy. Watching a man of his intelligence and wit engage in predictable sight gags is almost vomit-inducing.If you find the following gags to be hilarious, then this may be the film for you: Birds defecate all over the guys as they're cruising on their bikes; The four guys go skinny-dipping in a lake and, in one of those only-in-the-movies moments, a happy-go-lucky family stops by the lake to go swimming with them; A running gag involving Macy crashing into things while riding on his bike (Ooooh, how original!); A gay cop who gets stimulated when discovering the four guys camping together and cuddling up next to each other in a sleeping bag; Lawrence squirts ketchup and mustard all over two biker dudes; How's this for originality? The four guys enter a biker bar and the jukebox comes to a screeching halt, followed by the patrons eyeballing them in unison.What made me even more angry was that the audience was roaring with laughter throughout, proving that audiences nowadays will laugh at almost friggin' anything! I would place all the blame on bad writing and bad directing, but audiences eat this crap up with a spoon. How is Hollywood supposed to make sufficient profits unless they give people what they want? The only decent moment in the entire film is a surprise cameo at the end. I can't totally blame the actors for trying to make the best of a lame script, though Lawrence's performance is most annoying. Like he's done in past clunkers like ""Blue Streak"" and ""What's the Worst That Could Happen,"" he tries to make the best out of a lame script by hamming it up to ridiculous extremes, mugging and squelching out awful one-liners. Ray Liotta gives a fine performance, seemingly forgetting that he's doing a comedy, and playing a villain with as much gusto as he would in any of his dramatic films. Unfortunately, he's not on screen long enough to save the film.If you find this Godawful film funny--OK, it's a matter of taste. But please read a book afterwards. Do something to ensure that you still maintain a certain level of sanity. Other than the surprise cameo, the only good thing I can say about the film is it has a damn good soundtrack (containing songs by great artists like Lynyrd Skynrd and The Allman Brothers). But you can save the price of a movie ticket by simply buying the soundtrack.",Wild Hogs
71,simonparker1990,Has-Beens on a Road Trip! What's not to like?,7,12 April 2007,"Wild Hogs is full to the brim of actors that have had their moments in the spotlight, and then suddenly found themselves in a dodgy kids comedy without a hope in hell of returning to their former glory. First up there's John Travolta, the man that stunned the world with his movies in Saturday Night Fever and Grease. During the early nineties he had already hit has-been status before Quentin Tarantino resurrected him with his best performance in Pulp Fiction. Then Travolta threw it all away when he suddenly decided to star in an epic sci-fi called Battlefield Earth. It flopped, big time, and Travolta's career belly flopped with it. In fact until recently where he sort of did well in Be Cool he hasn't had much luck. Next up are Martin Lawrence and Tim Allen. Lawrence can be funny, trust me its difficult for me to say this as I think he's one of the most excruciatingly awful actors out there. But his problem is choosing bad movies such as Big Momma's House, Big Momma's House 2 and loads more. Tim Allen was funny, he became a household name with The Santa Clause and Home Improvement. Yet he became quickly unfunny by the time Santa Clause 3 had come out. In fact out of the four leads, the only one who is kind of still doing well is William H Macy who is a very talented and funny actor. So naturally with all these old actors in the movie I thought the movie stank of desperation. And admittedly that stink still sort of sits with me, this is a movie for them trying to have a comeback. Luckily enough though the movie is still good old fashioned fun, and if its a comeback they want I think they might have gotten one.As I started off talking about the actors first I'll talk about the performances. Now three of the actors I found quite good, not amazing, but passable. The other one seemed almost asleep throughout the movie, or so hyper on caffeine it drove me mad. Tim Allen has certainly done well here, actually in all fairness he was never a bad actor at all. Even in Santa Clause 3 he had some moments. Here he's clearly having fun and its nice to see him away from kids movies for once. It works for him here and hopefully we'll see a lot more of him delivering this kind of performance. William H Macy is great fun, he's playing the moron of the group, yet he makes him really likable. He definitely has the best lines and scenes in the movie. Now then, Martin Lawrence. Okay he's alright. Annoying at times, and I still think he has all the talent of a bowl full of water, but he did make me laugh a few times, and this is certainly one of his best movies in a long while. Surprisingly though the weak link is John Travolta. Which admittedly surprised me a lot. In the trailer he seemed about the best thing, here I think he was asleep most of it. He smiles a lot, he pretends to be cool, and at times he does this ridiculously high voice that doesn't even come close to funny. He stank of desperation the most, especially a scene where he teaches William H Macy to dance, it wouldn't surprise if Travolta asked for that scene to be put in so he can cling onto his glory days.The humour of Wild Hogs isn't exactly the most intelligent to say the least. In fact when William H Macy comes out of the forest holding a bag of his own poo you realise exactly what kind of humour it is. But the movie makes it work by having tonnes of energy. Admiteddly at times the jokes fail very badly, there are some jokes dotted around that like Travolta stink of desperation. Another problem people might have is the lack of much of a story, they're on a road trip, where they're going I still don't know, why they're really doing it I don't really know. Basically its middle aged men trying to reclaim their freedom, and in Travolta's case trying to escape the bailiffs from reclaiming his house. Personally it never bothered me, but I believe it might bother some people. The de3sperate attempt at inserting a villain as well doesn't help matters. Ray Liotta in fact is pretty poor as the villain, and I swear he has the most nasty looking laugh I have ever seen in my life! I cringed when ever he opened his gob to do that horrible laugh.Overall Wild Hogs is a fun movie, that while completely forgettable and not having the best moments in the world, can still make you smile. Three of the four leads might just get their big comeback after all, as for Travolta, well maybe if he bothered he might have done. Oh well, no doubt we'll see all four of them by the time the inevitable Wild Hogs 2 comes around.",Wild Hogs

Not one of these scenes was funny. They were unfunny scenes meant to be mistaken for funny ones.It's difficult to say why an unfunny scene isn't working: the writing, the delivery, timing, but there's one unmistakable test to know that it isn't. You're not laughing.Tim Allen's a dentist and the big joke is that the saliva sucking tube is really powerful. Martin Lawrence goes back to work for the firm and The Firm turns out to be waste disposal, John Travolta is arguing with some guy on the phone and it turns out to be the kid who rakes his leaves and William H. Macy is the nerd who inadvertently brings up porn on his laptop in the coffee shop.It's painful and a little depressing to see talented people doing such bad work. Think of any big movie star who ends up doing Grade Z horror movies at the end of their career. Only these guys are at the top of their game and they should have held out for something better.The concept of this movie sounds great, that's why I rented it in the first place, but you have to have a good script to start off with.

85,Strider_1978,An enjoyable flick where four talented actors pull out a few laughs.,7,14 March 2009,"We got this from the library because my wife wanted to watch it. THe story of four guys that choose to get away from their somewhat dysfunctional lives and hit the open road together as 'wild hogs'.I'll keep this brief. It's one of those films that you watch not because its very entertaining or very funny, but because it's a time out from life to enjoy four talented actors in a fun movie.It's clear that the intention was purely to get together and make a film that doesn't take itself too seriously, but has a few genuine laughs here and there without resorting (most of the time) to offensive humour. It proves that fun movies still exist and that the more mature generation still has it; and that natural talent can and does trump a forced expression and a cheesy line.Wild Hogs go for a ride, Wild Hogs get involved in questionable activity, wild hogs in-inadvertently make a few enemies. Q minor conflict and a happy ending.Mild warning here- this is not a family film. It an 'easy reading' film that does not have a complex story and its been made just for fun, but nonetheless it contains some mild language that I would not want a pre-teen or child to be exposed to. Regardless of what they hear in school: SOB, the four letter s and b word and three letter a words are all present. I don't know if this is a 'cool' American thing or not but I don't think it's necessary to have any swearing or foul language in period. Why can't they say 'son of a gun' 'suckers' or another variety of word.The comedy is 'fun' comedy ranging mostly from typical to amusing physical comedy. I think I laughed heartily two or three times towards the end of the film. Physical slapstick is OK, but in order for it to be really affective it needs to be done by professionals who know how to use it. I draw your attention to the original pink panther.It's sad that the 'black' humour has daughters looking like 'Eskimo hookers' after they have used the S word twice. I like Martin Lawrence, I believe that he can sell a joke without crudity.All that said, it's a fun movie that will draw a few giggles. For me it is Tim Allen that wins the day, along with Ray Liotta who really excels at playing a Psycho.

John Travolta, Martin Lawrence, Tim Allen, and William H. Macy are four middle aged men who have been best friends for years and have always been ""biker buddies"". But they all have families and careers now and are devoted to them, which gives them no time for the bikes. But then one day Woody (John Travolta), who's wife has just left him and has recently filed for bankruptcy, calls up the guys and tells them that they should go on a cross country road trip just to get out. But he doesn't tell them that the real reason he wants to go is because of his recently broken home. So they all agree to go on this road trip and become the ""Wild Hogs"" again. And once they set out across the west, the laughter and excitement ensues.Their adventures include going skinny dipping in a lake, only to have a family with kids show up and go swimming with them. They go camping and accidentally set their tent on fire and are forced to sleep outside curled up next to each other. Then a gay park ranger (a hilarious John C. McGinley from ""Scrubs"") shows up and thinks they feel the same way he does about men. Then in New Mexico they end up in roadhouse full of biker gangs and get criticized for not being ""real bikers"" and end up being in a barroom brawl. To keep from being killed, the ever so naive Dudley (brilliantly played by William H. Macy) sells his bike to the leader of the biker gang (Ray Liotta). When they leave, halfway down the road Woody realizes that Dudley needs his motorcycle back so Woody goes back to the roadhouse and accidentally sets it on fire while trying to steal the bike. Then that causes the ""Wild Hogs"" to flee and hideout in a Chili Cookout parade event. There Dudley falls in love with the hostess of the cookout (Marisa Tomei). But Ray Liotta and his gang have found the Wild Hogs and want Dudley's bike back. But Woody won't give it to them and now the Wild Hogs must save their backs.All the performances were great, but I think the one who really stood out was William H. Macy as Dudley. He was such a naive computer nerd with a heart of gold who was prone to accidents. I laughed every time he and the guys would be riding their bikes and he would turn his head to smile at them, and when he looked back he would run into something and get knocked off his bike. It happened to him several times in the movie and usually a joke like that would get old but it didn't' in this film. I laughed every time. And it was only him that it was happening to! Until the final scene in the film when all the guys got knocked off their bikes!! That was classic. John Travolta was his usual self but I really liked his character and he was like the ""leader"" of the Wild Hogs. I loved how it showed that he really cared about his buddies. Tim Allen as Doug was hilarious as ever as a hypochondriac dentist who couldn't eat cholesterol but always tried to find someway to do so. His character in this film was very reminiscent of his Tim Taylor character in his 1990s show ""Home Improvement"" which I used to watch on a regular basis. And then Martin Lawrence as Bobby was funny as ever as the main black guy who always brings ""black"" humor to his films. And I'm not being racist when I say that. I especially loved how he was afraid to confront his wife at the end of the film because he hadn't told her where he was going on the trip with the guys. And then Ray Liotta was his usual creepy self as the head of the biker gang. He had some funny lines but he didn't' deliver them in a funny way. He didn't smile very much and it seemed out of place in a comedy like this. But it was still a very funny and entertaining film. I think anyone who enjoys light hearted comedies that involve a circle of friends going on disastrous road trips will enjoy this one. I sure did! Thank you for reading my review!",Wild Hogs
87,Staymetal8390,One wild ride,9,2 September 2007,"This movie was so fun, I can't help but want to see it over and over again. It has a kind of slow beginning, but once those hogs hit the road, the laughs roll in.Well-casted, John Travolta, Tim Allen, William H. Macy and Martin Lawrence mix well as buddies who take a trip together to get away from their mid-life crises. So they fire up their hogs, and hit the road to land trouble with the bike gang, Del Fuegos lead by Ray Liotta.This movie is perfect family fun, some slight sex humor and language, but it's so worth the rental or to buy because you'll laugh over and over again.",Wild Hogs
88,mikhalt,not bad but not that great,7,8 March 2007,this film wild hogs looks OK in my opinion really brings these kind of elements together in terms of the tepestry of actors that come in to bring it in this piece. But at the end leaves the viewer in a stump sort of place because he doesn't know whether he wants to be groused out by the flesh hogs or impressed by the acting skill level of the movie. The storyline doesn't sound that strong and this is not anything I would want my kids to go and see. So not really worth the monye in my opinion go and see Christina richies new flick at least she and samuel can draw a bigger crowd and a thick story with some rope laced around it. so that is that is all I have to say,Wild Hogs
89,mick987g,Loved this movie,7,5 March 2007,"When I first saw the trailers for this movie I knew it would do well at the movies. Reason being that Buddy movies on the road always seem to do well.This goes back to Bob Hope and Bing Crosby Road movies.This movie doesn't fail to make you laugh.Tim Allen, John Travolta, Martin Lawrence and William H. Macy work well in this comedy about middle-aged men searching for more from life.It was like one good line after another.I don't like to give much away so if you want to see it.John C. McGinley part, as the motorcycle cop is pretty funny, and was just enough to not overkill the character.Marisa Tomei whom I haven't seen in quite awhile still looks good as Dudley Frank (William H. Macy) girlfriend.It's always good to see Jill Hennessy as well. Though there wasn't much of her in it since this is a sort of a male bonding movie.I have heard of talk about a sequel to this movie. I don't know what they could do in the next movie since I thought the put in everything including the kitchen sink.Oh well hope you enjoy this movie as much as I did",Wild Hogs
90,galahad58,Hog Wild Laughter,9,18 March 2007,"Critics have been panning Wild Hogs in their writings. I have read a lot of negative response from the same goof-balls that have promoted some very bad movies. Sometimes I wonder if they are on certain payrolls to give a certain vote towards a movie. With that said---Wild Hogs is absolutely wonderful. In today's day of poor comedies (see anything starring Will Farrell for example) that do not produce a laugh or a smirk---Wild Hogs is a breath of fresh air. I have lately been happy if a movie has at least one good laugh to feel like my admission fee was worth spending. And in today's movie world, most movies are one joke wonders. Wild Hogs is a throw back to the days of My Cousin Vinny, Airplane, and Young Frankenstein. This movie was filled with laughs and good gags. The movie starts off slow and is reminiscent of a couple of failed Tim Allen projects (Shaggy Dog and Zoom), but after about 15 minutes it shifts gear and becomes a wonderful comedy well worth spending the admission fee. If you want to have a good laugh and enjoy yourself---see Wild Hogs.",Wild Hogs
91,Hint523,A Pleasant Surprise,5,10 March 2007,"I want all people to know before reading this, that I hate Tim Allen as an actor. John Travolta has gone down the pipe. Martin Lawrence doesn't do anything for me. And William H. Macy is a good actor but is in absolutely nothing these days. The only reason I went was because my friends dragged me into going. At the beginning, within the first 5 minutes, the film opens with a little snippet of all the character's lives. These were all on the commercials, so I didn't really laugh at first. But the movie slowly picked up, getting more and more funny as it moved forward. By the time they got to the town, all the jokes were outright hilarious. And despite the little quirks about the movie that I didn't like, I found it to be a good comedy. If you want to get some laughs, go see this movie.",Wild Hogs
92,fatemaster2003,How I Miss This Kind of Movie A Lot,10,14 August 2007,"Wow. I haven't seen a good comedy, since I saw Hot Shots and Naked Gun. Since that, none of the comedy genre movie, ever make me laugh out loud till I hurt my stomach. I'm talking reality here.Wild hogs got the old comedy atmosphere, which I felt, very very hilarious. Unlike the ""new age comedy"" atmosphere, which involve sex a lot and a lot of dirty talk. I don't really like the kind. When I watch the Wild Hogs I felt like watching the Naked Gun and Hot Shots again. It's not like American pie or Roadtrip or Wedding Crusher or something similar like that.In wild hogs, you will see a lot of funny acts, talks, and funny physical events that will make you laugh till you cry. Believe me. 'coz yesterday when I watch the movie, I really laugh till I felt numb in the stomach, and tears run out from my eyes (not because it's sad, but it's way too funny) For a comedy lover, watch this movie. Believe me. You won't be disappointed.I rate it 10/10",Wild Hogs
93,DashTheGreat,Absolute Garbage,3,17 August 2007,"(Spoilers) Wild Hogs was your typical, quasi-funny movie that flames out at the end. This movie started off decently, hovering at least in the 5 - 6 area of scoring. The first half was decent, but was nothing to be proud of. The only funny parts are really in the beginning, such as when Macy's computer accidentally goes onto porn. After that, the movie started to go downhill a little, and still delivered. I can admit that, for a movie that has a guy crapping into a plastic bag, I did laugh at parts in the beginning. Then, the ""Wild Hogs"" met the other bikers, and it was all over. The freaking explosion in back of them looked like a nuclear bomb. I was hoping that the Del Fuego idiots were being roasted just to get rid of their bad, over the top acting. Instead, they of course have to come back and torture us some more. After this, the movie became dry and boring: you will look at the clock every 2 seconds. John Travolta becomes unbelievably annoying, and stock characters jump out of the woods like a Vietnamese ambush. In review, Wild Hogs was more like a G movie. The Wild West town that they went to was more like a cartoon, where Yosemite Sam would jump out and fire his revolvers into the air.Ending - The ending was absolute garbage. It wasn't even remotely interesting, and the fact that both of the mens' families found them without even knowing where they were is the same black hole that ate Tim Allen and John Travolta's careers. Of course, this is one of those stupid movies where the characters ""find"" themselves at the end. Lawrence finds his grapes, Tim Allen feels good about himself, Travolta's life still sucks, and Macy gets the girl (who he promptly leaves to never return). Wild Hogs is a horrible movie that should be stuffed into your local incinerator and set to a fast burn.3 / 10 - Somewhat funny, but boring in the second half. I wouldn't recommend it.",Wild Hogs
94,dan_c99,One of the worst movies ever made,1,1 September 2009,"This is a quote from another review:""Like so many others in the Theater I could not stop laughing. Even when tears were abundant running down my cheeks and my side hurt. Luckily everyone else was just as loud with laughter so I was not the only laughing fool in the place. With this group I didn't know quite what to expect as sometimes they are funny and sometimes not so much. The antics and the character actors in this film was PURE genius. It has the type of humor for everyone. Must see and Must DVD buy. Glad to see at least one good movie for 2007. Tim Allen and John Travolta who would have thought ? The big surprise in the film was William Macey. I din't realize the guy could be that funny. He played to comic goof and pulled it off with flying colors. Hats off to all.""The person who wrote that must have been born on another planet. There is nothing funny, amusing, interesting, entertaining, enlightening or anything in this piece of junk. Big shot stars phoning it in for a fat paycheck.I guess Travolta needed to buy another 747. Please, can't his career be over for good now? Martin Lawrence is a disgrace. Bill Macy is disgusting. Tim Allen should have known better, but I guess he needed to buy another mansion.These guys are all experienced and MUST have known the script was a joke. But a few easy weeks work and another $10 million hits the bank. Why the heck not?If you rent it, you should demand your money back...",Wild Hogs
95,keiichi73,"Macy is good, but the movie falls flat",2,4 March 2007,"William H. Macy is the kind of actor who can brighten up just about any film he appears in. He's got a certain charm and likability that he brings to just about every performance. It is perhaps no surprise that Macy is not only the best thing about Wild Hogs, but is also the film's sole highlight. I wanted to see his character appear in a better movie. The movie that surrounds the performance is a plot less and pointless exercise in tired slapstick and homophobic humor. Light as a feather and dumb as a brick, Wild Hogs flounders about lifelessly whenever Macy isn't on the screen.The paper thin plot, which exists simply to hook a series of sight gags and skits onto, centers around four lifelong friends who are all suffering different mid-life crisis. Doug (Tim Allen) is a dentist who is losing respect in his preteen son's eyes. Bobby (Martin Lawrence) has lost respect from everyone in his family, and is struggling to find work. Woody (John Travolta) has just gone through a messy divorce with his model wife, and has wound up losing all of his money in the process. And Dudley (William H. Macy) is a 40-year-old virgin who has devoted his whole life to computers and technology, and therefore has no idea how to act around women. The four have always had a passion for motorcycles, and Woody hatches a plan that they should all just hop on their bikes and explore the open road together. The friends go through a series of misadventures as they try to add some excitement to their dreary lives, and ultimately wind up running afoul of a vicious biker gang led by the dangerous Jack (Ray Liotta cashing a paycheck in a throwaway role) after one of the four guys accidentally blows up the gang's biker bar. Wild Hogs is the kind of movie that the people who design trailers dream about. That's because the movie is simply a series of loosely connected gags and scenes tied together by a loose plot. The trailer can't ruin the plot, because there is none to speak of. There isn't a single scene that helps develop the characters, or supply us with any real dialogue or emotions. It's just an endless build up of gags that often wind up falling on their face more than hitting their target. The movie relies far too heavily on outdated slapstick where people are hit in the head or fall over so frequently, we start waiting for it to happen, and we're usually right in our predictions. Equally outdated is the film's numerous unfunny jokes involving gays. There are a number of instances where the four friends find themselves in a situation where they are mistaken for being gay, or scenes where the movie simply uses a feminine man for laughs for no reason whatsoever. The film's screenwriter is Brad Copeland, who has written many very funny TV shows such as My Name is Earl, Arrested Development, and NewsRadio. Maybe he got nervous writing his first full-length screenplay, but the humor on display here is far below the quality his TV shows usually possess.Because of the lame and uninspired script, the usually talented cast are not able to escape from its banality, and wind up becoming victims to it. Tim Allen, John Travolta, and Martin Lawrence merely disappear into the background, not really creating anything resembling a character, nor getting any memorable lines. Instead, only William H. Macy is able to break through of the clichéd ""geek"" character he's stuck with, and make himself stand out. He makes the character work because of his performance. It's a shame that the movie doesn't give him anything truly interesting to do with that performance. He does have a romantic subplot with a sweet small town waitress (Marisa Tomei), but the movie forgets to give them a reason to fall in love or anything resembling a real relationship, since Tomei's character maybe has four minutes worth of dialogue in the entire film. Likewise, Ray Liotta is given very little to work with as the villain, but at least he seems to be having fun with the role. Not even a last minute cameo by Peter Fonda earns its laugh, because the movie makes the fatal mistake of thinking that the star of Easy Rider playing a legendary biker is funny by itself, instead of giving him something actually funny to go along with his role.I have no problem with respectable actors like Macy and Liotta appearing in silly movies like this, as long as the film itself is up to their talents. Wild Hogs casts them adrift in an aimless screenplay where they're forced to survive merely on their screen presence alone. They manage to stay afloat, but the movie itself sinks faster with each passing uninspired moment. This movie could have been made by anyone, and did not need to involve such strong talent. The entire movie itself winds up being a bust even as a buddy road trip comedy, as we never truly believe that the four main characters are friends to begin with. They have no real chemistry together, and never get to create a strong bond with one another necessary for this kind of film. Wild Hogs seems to just want to make us laugh and show us a good time. If this is true, the filmmakers should have rethought their strategy before the actors went before the cameras.",Wild Hogs
96,Listen_to_the_Law,Bad idea and cheap laughs--skip this,3,15 April 2007,"Wild Hogs is a comedy/adventure about four guys who need a break from their current lives and their wives. Allen is Doug, a childish, good-hearted man to whom his son finds uninteresting. Travolta is Woody, a man who had it all until he lost his money and his swimsuit-model wife. Lawrence (of Big Momma fame) is Bobby, a man who gets pushed and ordered around by his attitude-full wife. Macy plays a likable nerd, Dudley, who tries to get with the ladies, which goes mostly unsuccessful. Problem is, none of the characters are remotely interesting or entertaining. With the exception of Dudley, all the others are just there and act as typical as most average everyday Americanswhich is just what the horrendous script called for. So it's not exactly the actors' faults.As most comedies have shown, the laughter is solely based off of how strong the characters are. That's not happening here: the groans- I mean laughs, are mostly hit and miss, with most being the ladder. The few laughs are good for what they are, (ex. man singing the lyrics ""Dontcha wish your girlfriend was hot like me,"" and a cell phone accidentally hitting a truck's windshield) but everyday I laugh much more with my friends than I ever did watching Wild Hogs.Aside from the characters, a humorous comedy must (or at least should) have an interesting storyline. Most people wouldn't think it, but a storyline is an important (albeit simple) part of separating a good comedy from a failure. From Bringing Down the House to Naked Gun, all those comedies had a semi-strong storyline to add to the laughs. Even fat-person spoof Norbit had a somewhat detailed storyline. Here, all the plot has is four over-the-hill men motorcycling across the country to avoid their wives and to momentarily forget about their decreasing hairline. Heck, my summary is funnier than the movie. And just a minute of Norbit beats this whole movie.Looking back on Wild Hogs, the only thing wild about the movie is the actors eager anticipation to pick up a paycheck. No one really tried, especially Travolta. I wish I could look over the final script (with all the writers writing all over it) and study it. It just seems so careless, so coarse, so un-comedic. This script deserves to be laughed at, unlike the movie, which deserves the boos I gave it leaving the theatre.Good) few remote laughs Bad) the whole story, the idea, the writers, all the clichés, actors not trying/caring, etc.Pussycat Dolls) Every recent comedy seems to be milking their song, ""Dontcha""",Wild Hogs
97,dfcurran,This was a load of laughs,10,2 March 2007,"Although I though this was a little slow in the very beginning and some of the earlier gags just silly, I found myself laughing throughout and the laughs kept coming louder and harder as the movie progressed. Tim Allen and William Macy shined in this. Macy's character being particularly well done. Travolta played the tough guy in the group but he was no match for the real bad guys they ran into. This movie is studded with Televions stars. Jill Hennesy is terrific as Allen's wife and she isn't in this enough. Stars from Lost and Scrubs appear too. Some of the situations are incredibly funny, such as when Macy convinces the other to go skinny dipping. The conflict ending is a bit of a surprise, but an enjoyable one and don't forget to watch the credits. They are hilarious. Overall this is a real hoot so 10 stars.",Wild Hogs
98,sirvertual,Acrcross the country...in an hour...,5,23 September 2007,"YES!...this movie rates a 'solid 5' as in the best of mediocre...or you could say it's 'half-full (if you're an optimist)...or 'half empty' (if you're a realist!)...To me(meaning, it's just my lil' old' opinion), here's another 'and all too frequent' (these days) film that just doesn't live up to the 'HYPE' the studio/media folks spew out in a 'Visual-Vomit' marketing plan. In a way, I think instead of worrying with all the rating business...You know, the PG-or-R designations, they should rate it on how truthful the 'hype' is...If it's as good as all the commercials, movie posters, promo-guest appearances all the actors do, etc, etc., there should be a rating (somewhere) that states 'Hey, this movie really 'is' as good as they say!'. OR 'Don't believe everything you read about this movie, it's a 'B' movie with 'A' money behind it. (Something along those lines), but instead, it's like every fast food restaurant showing these immaculate, perfect, 'edible' sandwiches, but when you actually get one, well it's was obvious it was thrown together from across the room by someone who wouldn't eat the very thing they expect you to be happy mealed' with... So here's another take on the 'road-trip' scenario...Supposedly, these very 'strange group of friends'(not-believable) are going on motorcycle trip across the entire country, to the pacific ocean. (I) never caught on where they were starting from...it may be Iowa??? The point is it's kindov' important to the overall coherence of the storyline. This is a (missed)'grand' filming opportunity as (please let me explain)if they were all in oh'say uhhh: Brooklyn(?) & escaping the 'trappings of their city lives' on this spur-of-the-moment road-trip, the camera & sounds would allow us to see, hear, feel the 'tensions and stresses; of their 'Brooklyness'-lifestyles and the same goes for the other high points/low points of the trip...Instead of distracting from the storyline, exploring the scenery a bit and showing the presumed (to dumb to follow a story) audience some of this country's beautiful (and quickly vanishing) uh'-countryside and its interesting inhabitants. instead, we are shown larger than life head-shots of each (well-recognized) actor as they recite their lines in front of the camera...almost like the channel-? news reporter before they cut to 'whatever'...No, this was a missed opportunity that may have added several more minutes to the movie (big-deal), but would have also 'dramatically enhanced the total experience of watching this flick'. Afterall, a huge advantage of(the only one I can think of)riding a bike across the country is the complete different experience of actually 'seeing' the scenery, versus riding/driving in a car...Instead we get a 'stay-to-the-storyline' & a 'hurry-up-and-get-to-the-end-of-this-movie' kind of feeling...Almost like everyone had somewhere else to be, so, it's more of a 'let's just get this done and wrap it up' kindov' feeling. And it comes across the screen like that too. Seriously, it really does feel this way, especially when the ending credits start rolling and you're thinking: 'man, that was quick!'...'Is that it?'...it's already over?'..That wasn't that good, was it?'... EXCEPT for the performances by William H. Macy, Marisa Tomei(sp?)...and to be fair 'most' of the actors...I think that 'Hurry-up, get-it-finished' feeling comes from the overall 'pace' of this flick and scene-selection (or the lack of)...It's as if it's a 'behind the scenes' decision or a case of 'severe editing' that took this movie's 'across-the-country-adventure' and made it into a cute lil' quick (& predictable) story...Which, by the way is really too bad, considering the 'heavyweight' actors involved in this project...Although it would still have ended up on the comedy shelf at blockbuster with everything else, it 'could' have been one of those movies you're pleasantly surprised to see come on TV on a Sunday afternoon or would rent 'again'...Instead, it's just gonna end up on the shelf where it belongs..Just don't buy it and put it on your shelf...Don't you have enough things collecting dust?...Plus, you'd even have trouble moving this one at the family yard sale, unless you slip it in with a box of books or something devious like that.OK...that's all I can say about it... I wouldn't want to 'spoil' any of the edge of your seat adventure scenes for anyone...(he-he)...",Wild Hogs
99,Clothes-Off,Macho Posturing 101,4,17 August 2007,"It's interesting to me how some people can deride films like ""Xanadu"" or, say, ""Mermaids"" as bombs, when a movie like this does well at the box-office, but will probably NEVER develop the following that those films have earned over time. There was really no point to this film. It's a few funny bits stretched out into a feature length movie. We only get a tiny taste of the protagonists' lives before they set upon their journey, so we don't really care (nor does the film ever bother to foreshadow) what is to become of them when it's over. In the meantime, we are expected to sit through lots of tedious dialogue involving midlife crises and speculation on where their lives took those mundane turns. There are also several--make that WAY TOO MANY--references which to me were not so much homophobic as just plain, well, let's call them ""homo-stupid.""What really ticked me off was that even in a comedy, there apparently was a drastic need to have all the characters at some point throw and receive violent punches, and somehow show the experience to be rewarding.

102,TrickTaylor,"Guilty pleasure, but confused.",7,26 March 2007,"Normally, Wild Hogs would be the kind of movie I would gladly tear apart. In fact, it wouldn't be the kind of movie I would ever choose to go and see. But life sometimes forces us into theaters we don't expect, so Wild Hogs it was. I wanted to hate it. I expected to hate it. But the truth is that Wild Hogs is a guilty pleasure, fun way to spend a couple of hours.The City Slickers on motor bikes plot does not warrant elaboration. You have you typical stock characters in your typical stock situations. I must say that Tim Allen does this type of family friendly comedy very well. Actually, the whole cast works well together is an odd sort of way.I will say that the homophobic base for a lot of the jokes seem outdated, and the cartoon violence during the final scenes really lessens the impact of the movie. Just watch IFC or a hockey fight to see what multiple punches really do to a person. That's why I call this film confused. It wants to be a harmless male mid-life crisis movie, but feels it needs to infuse bad gay jokes and over the top cartoon violence. Too bad, because it could have been decent on its own premise.Marissa Tomei is smoking in this. Where the hell has she been? Wild Hogs will likely appeal to the majority of the common American film goers. And that's fine. For me, I file it under guilty pleasure, as a movie I enjoyed despite myself.",Wild Hogs
103,guasco-2,Don't listen to the hate,7,29 September 2020,"There's good chemistry with the four leads. Decent banter between them. More jokes land than fall flat.
The issue was the marketing. The film is edited like a PG family film and people went expecting that (Tim Allen in a PG13 film??).
In reality, the film's humor is actually aimed more at the teenage crowd. However, teenagers don't usually relate to story about middle aged guys losing their edge. It doesn't hit them in the feels.
In spite of this contradiction in humor and plot, the film is actually enjoyable. There are plenty of funny jokes and none of the characters are annoying or unbearable.
It's an easy film to throw on and enjoy with almost anybody over the age of 13.Perhaps the film should have been R an marketed as such.",Wild Hogs

This movie reminded me of a live action cartoon, with all of the old pratfalls, bathroom humor, and homosexual innuendos and humor that we have all seen a million times before. The characters portray every stereotype of men in middle age (wives that boss them around, kids who think they are ""lame"", not being allowed to eat anything but lettuce, etc, etc, etc). The script seemed like it was written by a 12 year old, and the jokes were very stale and unfunny. The fact that this movie has been #1 in the country for several weeks running only illustrates the lack of anything decent in theaters. The movie did feature a great cast (including a few nice cameos), but even that couldn't save this film. If you're looking for mindless humor and a predicable script, go and see this mess.

Doug who is now a dentist earning his bucks from his own private clinic found it difficult to relate to his son. He lives an uninteresting life of work, work and more work plus his caution of his health-line depicted by his LDL levels and his diet. Though he's got himself a family, he's displeased with the way that he is living his life. Dudley, a computer programmer (noticeably to be a geek to come up with that level) is unmarried, dateless and yes, he is smart enough to create a computer that speaks and obeys commands - sometimes, maybe a little bit over-obeying which we all seem to have noticed from the trailer; but then again, he's got no guts to even approach and talk to a girl though he do has some certain extent of his social skills which may seem fun. Erm, and yeah, that's about it for his life. Bobby, on the other hand, is married with 2 kids - a screamer and an Eskimo hoe... rite... you'll know why later... he seems to have lost control over his two kids whereas most of his uninteresting life (that being writing an unending book and whatever's left of his life) is mostly controlled by his wife. His old work, and so is it now, after being recalled into it by his wife is a plumber. And finally for Woody, a successful man working in a high society organization and who also married a super model wife faces a crisis of the implication of his high powered spending capacity. He's officially broke! With nothing to lose, all 4 of them - a workaholic, a nerd, a submissive guy and a broke man - this gotta just form a cool team for a roadtrip with a lot of silliness and laughter. There is basically no plot for this movie as it is an undetermined roadtrip with no where to go, but that makes things even better - if any of you who could remember the movie Without a Paddle, the idea of the movie is very much something like this. But I would have reasons to believe that this would be far better in terms of the number of laughters you will get and the surprises you will see. After all, with Tim Allen and Martin Lawrence in there, I don't see why not this movie for a selection of comedy! There is a small hidden message in this movie and if you are witty enough to pick it up from amongst those laughters - you will notice that a true friend will cling on no matter what goes wrong and that to achieve something that is seemingly so impossible, you just have to get up and face the reality and the consequences right in front of you, though at many a times, it may seem that things will get ugly. Coz who knows, if you're lucky enough, you'll get off, though you'll have to experience maybe a few bruises that will kick in on your face, but it's all worth it! But some experiences don't really work in terms of winning a girl by being brave - that being said, facing a gang of 50 muscle guys all by yourself to save your most beloved's diner. Ahahaha...",Wild Hogs
106,ninjagaiden007,It will never win any Oscars. This film is great for cheering up and nonstop laughs.,8,21 April 2007,"This movie had a pretty weird cast. Weird characters. Weird everything. But the movie works out really well. It's actually good to see Tim Allen playing in something else besides the boring Christmas and family movies. The acting is very weird...but it really suited the characters they were playing. The plot itself is original and the whole idea is original. The plot is just 4 friends setting off on an adventure. Very simple and entertaining. John Travolta said in an interview that he had a blast doing this movie. He hasn't said that since Pulp Fiction and that's saying something.Overall a very entertaining and hilarious movie. My theater was crying with laughter. Everyone around me was laughing at some joke. Good for a laugh. If you're in the mood for laughter, see it. 8/10",Wild Hogs
107,rem1010,Why So much GAY References?,1,8 April 2007,"Sometimes a movie can drop from a great fun movie to one that is distasteful. This movie does not need all the references to homosexuality that it has in it. Makes a person think that all bikers are gay in leather! Is the director trying to push gay thoughts onto the audience that wants to see a neat motorcycle movie with John Travolta in it. I am surprised that he actually participated in a movie that contains so much reference to homosexuality. The singer at the festivities is an obvious attempt to make the homosexual gestures and words in the song to be funny, when they merely distract from the fun of the movie. Why have a cop make homosexual references that he wants to have sex with these bikers, not only once, but show up again naked at a swimming hole with the cast naked too? I think the movie has some makings of a great fun movie if those homosexual references are edited out, as they contribute nothing to the movie and actually send a message to young people that should not be in this type of movie. We are being barraged with sexual references in all types of movies today without the warnings that these movies contain these references. I am not against persons with alternative lifestyles, but I do not like being presented with obvious off color supposed to be humorous homosexual references and actions without my permission and I would be embarrassed to bring my teenage children to see this movie.",Wild Hogs
108,makeham98,Unlikeable cast,1,28 February 2007,"Another of the ""let's get former stars who were once considered funny and put them in an out-of-place scenario"" movies... City Slickers approach with a lousy script, an unlikeable lead (Travolta), two has-beens (Lawrence and Allen), and one decent actor who - on paper - doesn't belong with the rest of them (Macy, the only actor in the bunch).Oprah shilled for this movie, Leno shilled for this movie, with those ""my friends like me"" kind of testimonials.I especially like the earlier comment that Peter Fonda ""revised"" his character from Easy Rider. Well since that character was shot DEAD in Easy Rider, there's going to have to be some major revision.If you just can't wait for ""Ocean's 13"" of ""Cannonball Run 3"", you'll love this one.",Wild Hogs
109,newkfl,Going Hog Wild...,8,9 August 2008,"I really thought the movie Wild Hogs was very funny. I liked the attitude of just getting on the back of a bike and just going for it with no type of barriers to hold you back. They really roughed it without the use of cellular phones or some of the other modern conveniences of home. These guys were just tired of going through the same routine day in and day out. They needed a change and they went out to find it. Every stop that they made, they stood out, especially when they visited a real biker's bar with a biker gang. They met their match. They somehow knew that they would have to ""meet"" the biker gang again later to prove that they were men, Wild Hogs. Wild Hogs was a funny film.",Wild Hogs
110,JimSDCal,A good solid comedy,7,8 March 2007,"""Wild Hogs"" the new comedy from Tim Allen, John Travolta, Bill Macy and Martin Lawrence is a good comedy that entertains throughout but is far from scintillating. Macy is the funniest character in the film as Dudley, a nerdish computer programmer who is part of a weekend motorcycle club with Doug (Allen), Woody (Travolta) and Bobby (Lawrence). Each man is in a bad place in their life when the movie starts and each needs to get away, more to rediscover themselves than to explore America. So, the club goes on a cross-country trip from Cincinnati to the Pacific coast. They have several adventures along the way, the most interesting, and time-consuming, being their run-in with the Del Fuego motorcycle gang in New Mexico. The club runs afoul of the Del Fuegos leader, played by Ray Liotta, who hates them because in his estimation Woody, Bobby, Doug and Dudley are poseurs, who embarrass real motorcyclists. Feeling this Liotta steals Dudley's motorcycle leading eventually to a confrontation between the two groups. The comedy in the movie is uneven and Travolta does not seem to be suited to this type of humor, he is much better in ""Be Cool"" and ""Get Shorty"", but overall this film provides solid entertainment. I grade it a 2.75 out of 5.0 points.",Wild Hogs
111,ygodson,A rough and funny ride,6,8 June 2008,"Travolta,W.H.Macy,M.Lawrence,T.Allen what else you need in a movie yet Wild hogs fails to make a huge impression.I agree that Wild hogs is a good entertaining movie with lots of laughs but when you have veterans like Martin Lawrence,you expect a little bit more from them.The pace of the movie is set by the introduction scenes of the 4 characters.All four introduction scenes are funny.The four characters did show their individuality and they did a pretty job.The bull slapping scene,the encounter with a homosexual cop scene,the scene where M.Lawrence bullies the two members of the Del Fuegos are worth mentioning.Expect Wild Hogs to entertain not enlighten. 6/10 for a rough and funny ride",Wild Hogs
112,SonicBoom77,Review:,4,28 March 2007,Well before i can start talking about how bad this film is i give it this it was very funny. But come on there is barley a plot to it it' simple you see where its going there was only two good scenes in the movie the rest was just stupid. Mainly all your watching is 4 guys riding bikes skinny dipping taking a leak and ticking off bad bikers and drinking bear so its stupid film all i can say is don't see it but it is funny.So ill say very good cast time Allen is great and there all full of great actors knowing for signing on for great movies but not this one was just a let down i was actually planing on seeing TMNT but my friend was late so i seen the movie instead and it wasn't very good so do yourself a favor and not see this film. Until next time c ya.,Wild Hogs

114,McBitter,Wild Hogs? More Like Wild Bore.,1,1 April 2007,"'Wild Hogs' is a comedy like no other! Oh wait yes it is. Like in my previous review for 'Blades of Glory', the originality factor is very slim.I am going to revisit a point made in the 'Blades of Glory' review. Another geek, another hot girl. So there are many comedic films with that feature. Not only that though but more gay jokes. We have NEVER seen that before have we? The original jokes just keep going on and on in this movie.The acting is adequate for a movie like this but the dialog is laughable beyond laughable. I mean that in a bad way.Skip it.",Wild Hogs
115,paulcf-510-910462,Beyond pathetic,1,18 May 2014,"This is so predictable, so nauseating that I can't believe these talented men (and women) made this pathetic stupid movie! The premise is, like, written by a 10 year old. The geography is totally out of sequence, mountains and then New Mexico and so forth. One rider has a leather 'helmet' which does nothing for safety. The plot, is there one, is very lame.On several occasions they crash a bike and then instantly they are riding again, no damage. Several times they are violently ejected off the bikes, no injury! I could go on and on. I ride motorcycles and it's nothing like this dumb wasted movie.I am so glad I didn't pay a cent to see it, other than the fact that I lost my time watching it.Pathetic in all ways, avoid it.",Wild Hogs
116,pouge162,Motorcyclist comedy,7,21 January 2019,"Some things in the movie are over the top related, which in comedies, is the point. Not a movie that will change your life and it has some slow spots, but as a whole, it is a decent movie. But it's up to people's taste to like or dislike.",Wild Hogs
117,i_know_i_die,Preditable But Still Funny,8,1 May 2007,"There are more and more movies about cars and bikes(not bicycles) nowadays. Most of them are so serious. Always the guns, action and babes. Not saying I hate them. I enjoy them. I love the movie Taxi (Not the remake). But too much is also very boring. So when I saw the Wild Hogs Trailer, I thought it might seems good because it is a comedy about American Bikers. I love those American Choppers! Anyway, it is about 4 best friends, Doug, Bobby, Woody and Dudley, who are all bikers and call themselves the Wild Hogs. One day, Woody ask his friends if they want to go on a road trip and they agrees. While riding on their bikes the stop at a bar. They are no welcome by the bikers there. They chased the 4 friends out and took one of their bikes. Woody is unhappy. He goes back and sabotage their bikers. So he took back the bike and they continue on their journey. When the bikers found out the wants to get the 4 friends and the have the final showdown on a small town.It is a good movie probably thanks to the color character in the show. Brilliant soundtrack. An OK story with lots of laugh out loud humor.If you're a biker, you're going to either enjoy or hate this comedy about bikers. Watch this with a group of friends and laugh with them. This is a really good comedy.",Wild Hogs
118,b1lskirnir,Extremely meh,5,26 February 2007,"While the premise is clever, the cast is great, and the trailer gives all indication of a highly amusing ensemble, middle-aged comedy I was not really impressed with Wild Hogs overall. This is one of those comedies where they save almost all of the good out-of-context humor for the trailer and practically give away the plot to draw you into the theater, but never really offer much more.More or less the basic premise is your four, suburban, middle-aged men who have had a bike ""gang"" for a number of years coming to the revelation of the total monotony of their lives. They decide to take a few days away from their families and inhibitions to relive the dreams of their youth, and thus a classic road trip comedy ensues.First off, if I have to give the movie any praise it should go towards the four leads. William H. Macy, John Travolta, Tim Allen, and Martin Lawrence, despite being limited by some terrible dialogue and cookie cutter characters, for the most part give hilarious performances and have great on-screen chemistry with one another. In the end this helps work it towards the classic ""Don't let anyone get you down"" message, but that's really all I can say on the positive side.The script is downright terrible. Through a large percentage of the movie I was trying to determine whether it was edited by 50 people with totally opposing ideas and no skill in writing dialogue, or if it was never edited and no one noticed it was written by someone with no skill in writing dialogue. Many times characters' motives for certain actions are either completely unfounded, or instantly noticeable, yet still pounded to the point where ""obvious"" becomes an understatement. Many minor characters fail due to the disappointing platter of lines they've been given, a contributing factor to why this may be the worst performance of Ray Liotta's career.It rakes in some laughs, sometimes pushing the PG-13 envelope to its limits in a fashion quite unusual for a film that could've easily gotten a PG rating, if not for its intentional marketing to the 30-55 demographic (the same as its characters) its intended to reach; not daringly offensive to receive an R, nor kiddie enough for a PG, but trying its hardest to be as watered-down PG-13 as possible with its share of aptly fitting racial remarks, homosexual undertones, crude sex humor, and sporadic profanity.The movie has some very good comedic moments, however, some of which are surprisingly clever and well-executed, but many that fall victim to many Hollywood comedy stereotypes, such as the ""One main character who does something that only he and the audience knows about and we will milk humor from this for the entire middle act"" syndrome and various others including the romantic redemption for the geek and the token black guy.Overall, if you want a socially acceptable, moderately funny, assembly line comedy with the inspirational message you will see in about 20 other mainstream releases this year, you won't be disappointed. If you're looking for absolutely anything more competent, you've come to the wrong place.",Wild Hogs
119,stellarbiz,Just not my cup of tea,2,14 March 2007,"I sat in a theater full of people who were laughing through the entire movie, but I seemed to be the only one not laughing. The only ""gag"" I thought in any way funny was the vulture, even though it is an old sight-gag. I was giggling at how cute the thing was trying to walk alongside.Otherwise, I didn't find the humor, sight-gags, or plot particularly funny or appealing. Most of it was unoriginal or insulting to the intelligence, or just plain dumb. Thankfully I saw it at a half-price matinée, so I didn't feel I wasted a lot of money on this.The ending was rather trite, and wasted promising plot-twist that also ended in a rather over used ending. I just did not appreciate this movie at all. At the risk of sounding elite, this was just below average, but with it's seeming popularity, I guess there are a lot of below average.... oh never mind. In my book, this is a movie where the stars must have been desperate for money to stoop to this lack of good humor to make this movie.",Wild Hogs

Along the way they encounter many mishaps including run ins with real bikers who don't take kindly to pretenders.

125,rchadwi@hotmail.com,Not Unfunny albeit predictable - see it for Macy,5,21 March 2007,"Overall, this movie is straight cookie-cutter ""mid-life crisis/ road trip gone bad"" - formulaic with the heavy use of absolutely predictable slap-stick, sight-gags and a not overly-original script. As far as the characters and a plot? You will predict with 100% accuracy every next turn.Having said that, the performances were good - William H. Macy canNOT seem to put in a sub-par performance; his character was portrayed very nicely. Martin Lawrence, who I usually hate, was actually very good. Allen and Travolta were...not bad, although that spot on both their Oscar shelves shall remain empty.If you're looking for an ORIGINAL comedy, one that will have you bust out laughing? You'll be sorely disappointed. But if you're the type of movie-goer who is grateful just to see a movie that's not god-awful crude, don't mind seeing/hearing the same jokes you've seen before performed fairly admirably, don't care about plot (because believe me, you'll predict EVERYTHING with pin-point accuracy - hell, I even predicted the CAMEO at the movie's resolution point) and like the safe/funny route, you'll be OK here.What price is it worth to see this?

126,Sam_Owens,OK movie but,7,25 August 2007,why must every movie that is about male stuff be chocked full of homosexual reference. Who's writing this stuff? Is it homosexuals that want to be straight? The movie would have been better if the gay references would have been left out because it did nothing to further the plot.I liked the movie for what it was a comedy. It could have been better if more time had been spent on the wife aspect because that is truly what bikers guys such as these have to deal with. They don't have to deal with queer cops and funny looking fey singers.Ray Liotta was real good and seeing Peter Fonda was great.

Some parts are hilarious that would make you crack up. I couldn't stop laughing from the beginning till the end. Its a must see movie and I seriously recommend it. All the cast gave an excellent performance and the dialog was hilarious. Martin Lawrence was a bit out of place since Tim, Travolta, Macy are quite older and supposedly have boring lives in the movie but non the less gave and excellent performance. also Ray Liotta was great in this movie. its lots of fun.

The script was clichéd and unfunny, with utterly predicable situations that could only be played as farce. You can imagine the cast had a good time goofing around with this material. Unfortunately, the results don't justify the effort. I still can't believe that actors of this caliber read such a script and agreed to do it. How embarrassing. Everything that should have been uproarious came out limp. Such talent mugging their way through bad material was painful to watch in places. You would think that at least William H.

Tonight we saw the comedy movie about middle aged businessmen taking a motorcycle trip through the west to get away from it all. People are used to the cutting edge humor of Chris Rock and Jerry Seinfeld, but this movie is mostly slapstick humor. It reminds me of Blazing Saddles except that no one laughs. If you liked Blazing Saddles, you might like this. The rating of sexually offending is a ploy to increase the box office. You wind up wondering how a good cast like this couldn't see the jokes were duds. John Travolta, Tim Allen, Martin Lawrence, Wm. H. Macy.

I should have kept my mouth shut or maybe just grunted but I said, ""It was like a Disney Movie."" Well, that didn't set well but it was, exactly like a Disney Movie. One saving grace: William H.

I am not the kind of person who rates everything 1's or 10's, nor do I write reviews regularly, but there was something singularly distasteful about this film that begged for a reaming on IMDb. I honest to god felt slightly brain-damaged for almost cracking a smile toward the end.Whether it was the phoned in performances of the four leads, or the asinine plot, or the ham-fisted comedy, or the sense that the joke was one massive gay joke, I can't be sure, but I can't begin to express the depths of my loathing for this paint by numbers mess.I feel bad for William H. Macy, I really do. No paycheck is worth this embarrassment. John Travolta, Tim Allen, and Martin Lawrence have all made some rotten, putrid films before, so this disaster simply doesn't leave that big of stain. But William H.

135,stoogedude,Ignore the critics...this is one FUN movie! (POSSIBLE SPOILERS!),9,3 March 2007,"After having seen Wild Hogs, I have to say that this film was the most fun I've had at the theaters in a YEARS! Since the movie was announced around a year ago, I have been shaking to see this movie, and it was worth the wait. What a fun movie! By the way, I'm not a paid reviewer for a movie studio to give ""positive"" reviews.I know a bad movie when I see one, even in previews. Norbit was not a good movie. Night at the Museum was good, not the greatest. But Wild Hogs was great for a cold winter night to sit in a PACKED theater and laugh along with everyone else.OK, Tim Allen hasn't been in some good movies lately. He just doesn't seem to care about making quality movies. But he sure hit the jackpot with this movie. Having been a fan because of Home Improvement, I found Tim Allen to have one of his funniest performances in years. The bull-slapping scene was hysterical.John Travolta isn't exactly known for his comedy, but he sure does make a person laugh here. His expression after he blows up the biker bar is priceless. After seeing John Travolta play such serious characters throughout the years, it's refreshing to see his lighter side.At first, Martin Lawrence's presence in this movie was a little odd. What on Earth is Martin Lawrence doing in a movie with Tim Allen, John Travolta, and William H. Macy? You know what? Who cares?! After some hardly funny movies throughout the years, Lawrence really shines in this film. Sure it's kind of hard to see Lawrence hanging out in this crowd, riding a motorcycle across the country, but it totally works. The scene where he pours ketchup and mustard on two of the Del Fuegos was hilarious.Then there was William H. Macy. What can I say about this man? Known for his great dramatic performances in movies such as Fargo and The Cooler, he is the highlight of this film, for me. He has a real future in comedy! His character, Dudley, proudly shows off his new ""biker"" tattoo. Instead of it being an eagle or something macho, it turns out to be the Apple Computer logo. The beginning sequence proved to be the point of the film where we discover that Macy was going to be hysterical. It's where Tim Allen is riding his motorcycle, soon to be joined by John Travolta, where they bump fists. Soon, Martin Lawrence joins the two and bumps fists with Tim Allen. Then, here comes Macy, where he bumps fists with Travolta, and in doing so, gets knocked off balance, going all over the place, eventually running into a big sign. Macy is a comic revelation in this movie, I can't simply tell all of his funny moments.We all know that Ray Liotta makes a great bad guy, and this film is no different. You love to hate him here. At first I thought that he was a little out of place as a mean biker, but he gives a convincing performance.If you watch the show ""Scrubs"", then you will recognize John C. McGinley...""Dr. Cox""...as a big, lean, homosexual cop who takes a fancy to the four Wild Hogs. For the little time he is in the movie, he steals every scene he is seen in.One thing though...why does M.C. Gainey appear in every movie he's in as a bad redneck or biker or truck driver and so on? Well, in almost every movie except Sideways...he's still a bad guy, just not a redneck bad guy.In short, critics are telling you to ignore this film. I'm telling you, if you want to have a great time at the movies with your family, (although not exactly for children under 12) then this is the film to see. There are nonstop laughs from start to finish. I enjoyed the HELL out of this film, and so will you.",Wild Hogs
136,tezhowes,A primer in how not to make a movie.,2,8 May 2017,"A few nights ago, I had the pleasure of watching a movie that fired on all cylinders; it was that rare bird that I expect achieved everything and more, from all involved, that it set out to be in its original imagining. This waste of 2 hours is its absolute inverse. The script is banal even for a popcorn flick, the humour, such as it is, flat to the point of feeling uncomfortable for the actors tasked to recite them, the characters cartoonish - even for what is at best a live action cartoon in and of itself - and the acting nightmarishly awful; even the usually reliable William Macy coasts on what could only be a self-referential parody of the milquetoast persona he knows the public expects of him by now. Travolta's input is particularly atrocious - one would think the man had never acted outside a high school play, though with the pablum substituting for dialog he was given to recite, perhaps he just decided it wasn't worth the effort. It's not a movie at all, in fact, just a series of flat, unrewarding, pedestrian skits strung together like nuggets of cheap costume jewellery along a slim thread of 2nd unit director establishing, stunt and scenery inserts - mostly (surprise) of 4 guys riding motorcycles. And even with its limited prospects overall, the climax and resolution could not have been more of an eye-rolling, impotently abortive cop-out. Just an abysmal waste of human and technical capital.",Wild Hogs
137,jay-976,Very anti-women...,2,30 January 2008,"Somewhat funny movie with some site gags and funny jokes...however, I hate to say it, but this is a very sexist movie. Firstly, it is a heavily male-dominated cast. Seondly, the few women in the movie (mostly wives or girlfriends) are depicted in less-than-favorable charicitures. Like, Tim Allen's wife, played by Jill Hennessy, is wishy-washy and allows her man to walk all over her and she bows to his every whim. I know I sure as heck wouldn't allow any man of mine to go out on a weeklong bike trip with his buddies. And Martin Lawrence's wife, the more aggressive one, is painted as being a bossy, controlling shrew. Marisa Tomei, who plays William H. Macy's love interest, is the typical pretty shrieking violet who has sex with him within days of knowing him. And, finally, John Travolta's wife is supposedly this gorgeous skinny much younger model/trophy wife who we never even see in the movie except for a few pictures. A few things to point out here. Firstly, the people who made this movie obviously hate women. This is what I gathered from watching this film. Secondly, I guess a bunch of macho male filmmakers decided ""Enough with the chick-flicks already!! Time to do a guy movie!!"" The problem with that is just about every film coming out in recent years has been a ""guy movie""!! We are living in post-feminist times where women are stepping out into the world and we are trying to be seen and heard in a male-dominated society. Maybe if this movie came out after women's lib finally prevailed and women were equally paid and taken seriously, then this film would have been a bigger success. However, this is not a good movie in these times of female empowerment.",Wild Hogs

Its nice however, sometime to just go to a movie and be entertained. This is one of those movies. It has to be one of the funniest comedies I have seen recently. I think the last comedy I saw in the theater was ""Click"" (which I thought was terrible). This movie was about a group of overworked, and just simply worn out guys who go on a road trip to California. They have many mishaps along the way. From burning down tents, to blowing up bars, nothing is safe from the ""Wild Hogs"". I thought the funniest character was William H. Macy. He plays a computer nerd and is perfect for the part. However, they all did a great job working with each other. This is a movie you can just go and enjoy. Every now and then in life we need that (as this movie shows).",Wild Hogs
139,drexelspivey,I'll never get those 100 nauseating minutes of my life back,1,9 April 2007,"""Wild Hogs"" is ""City Slickers"" on motorcycles-if ""City Slickers"" was deprived of fine ensemble acting, devoid of a palpable bond between its male leads and reduced to lowbrow, slapstick humor to elicit some cheap laughs. It is the waste that is created when producers serve up a shallow script, with proved box office superstars and a formulaic (see ""idiotic"") plot, and, time and time again, receive mass consumption.Box-office money makers Tim Allen (as Doug, the aging dentist), John Travolta (as Woody, the aging playboy whose wife has just left him), Martin Lawrence (Bobby, the henpecked husband), and respected actor William H. Macy (Dudley, the geeky tech guy) form middle aged, suburbanite motorcycle ""gang"" Wild Hogs.A combination of nagging wives, disrespectful sons, empty bank accounts, and midlife crises light a fire under the sagging behinds of our protagonists, prompting them to embark on a cross-country road trip.One of the few things uninspired director Walt Becker (""Van Wilder"") gets right is the soundtrack, featuring classic rock anthems (""Slow Ride,"" ""Who Do You Love?"") and hard rock/metal gems from AC/DC and White Zombie. Unfortunately, his persistent use of Teddy Castellucci's nauseating score is maddening.Is Doug sad? Why, yes-just listen to the sad violin. Thanks, Teddy.Aside from Mr. Macy, the cast is underwhelming. Mr. Lawrence's character is a pushover, Tim Allen looks like he showed up to collect his paycheck, and Mr. Travolta should be ashamed. For Travolta's sake, I hope Quentin Tarantino never glimpses his cringe worthy jaunt to Bobby Brown's ""My Prerogative."" Quentin might think twice before trying to jump-start Vinnie Barbarino's career for a second time.By the time the Wild Hogs run afoul of a real motorcycle gang, led by Ray Liotta, is there anyone out there who is unsure whether the heroes will cure their ills, long for their families, find a new love and save the day? I'll ruin it to save you the 99 minutes of your life you would have otherwise lost-yes to all of the above.Furthermore, the running gag of the film-homophobic jokes-are staler than the actors. John C. McGinley has ruined all his brilliant work on NBC's ""Scrubs"" by his appearance here as a gay, borderline psychotic policeman.All negativity aside, William H. Macy saves the film (barely) with his dorky but likable Dudley. He, along with a hilarious cameo by Kyle Gass (of Tenacious D fame) as an overzealous carnival-karaoke singer, help trim some of the fat off of the otherwise inedible ""Hogs.""",Wild Hogs

I've not seen many comedies of late and was a little apprehensive about this one. IMDb rated only 6.2 (and 8.0 for knocked up!!!).Imagine my surprise then when I laughed at a cleverly put together, well acted, entertaining....- YES, ENTERTAINING - remember that??!?!- and funny film. We both (My other half and I) really enjoyed it. I was also a little surprised at the cast, plenty of big names, all of whom seemed to be enjoying what they did. They gelled well.The storyline was being provided from the first minute, and I saw no real flaws. John Travolta is, in my opinion, usually good value for money, and all four leads were equal in this respect, with none of them trying to steal the show.No gratuitous sex, only slapstick (or reminiscent of a 50's western) violence, no ridiculous swearing all combined to make for not a single glance at what the time was, or how long left. A fair barometer of how enjoyable we found it.If I was reluctant to see this before, I can only make up for this by saying 'Go and see this film', and I will definitely watch it again.On the other hand... Don't bother with Knocked Up.Still, maybe it's me. Or do idiots vote on this site?",Wild Hogs

There's the stud, the successful one, the bum and of course the funny nerd. But the one thing they all share is wondering where our lives have gone? Macy is an absolute riot in this movie. He's the sweet nerdy guy who can only relate to computers. Tim Allen is the successful dentist, with a loving wife and family but he has lost his way.

The storyline of Wild Hogs is simple: 4 middle aged guys hitting the open road on their motorbikes to try and recapture their youth and get away from their humdrum lives for awhile. What makes it so funny are the little things that happen to them here and there and the dialog between them. All four (Allen, Travolta, Lawrence and Macey) did a superb job to make this movie hilarious. And Ray Liotta is the perfect bad ass biker villain.There isn't a whole lot of violence in it, no blood and gore, and the language is kept in check too which makes this a cute comedy a family with older children can watch together.",Wild Hogs

Given that he has a hardcore persona in real life I think he was well cast, but didn't do a lot for the film than perhaps bring a single moment of freshness, into this limp dishrag of a movie.I felt William J. Macy was miscast. He seemed very uncomfortable in his role as an inept and gullible loser, who wouldn't be? Although I could relate to him as well as any of the characters.

146,Bo16,You Hog!,7,11 April 2007,"John Travoltas latest vehicle, (yeah, I know...not funny) Wild Hogs appears from the off to be a stupid silly film that is going to try and teach us something at the end. A modern day parable if you will. Truthfully, it pretty much is. But that doesn't mean it can't be fun along the way.Let's start with the cast. Wild Hogs is surprisingly more of an ensemble cast than you would have imagined. Quite frankly, if I had to pick out one of the four leads (John Travolta, William H. Macy, Tim Allen, Martin Lawrence) who was on screen the least it would probably have to be Travolta. He seems to be the target of the advertising campaign but it's nice to see the other leads have a good deal of screen time. William H. Macy is personally one of my favourite actors. He's usually a supporting actor and excels at any role he takes on. But unfortunately, short of Fargo I cannot think of a film he's led that has been particularly successful. In Wild Hogs it's fun to see him stretch his legs and have a little bit of fun. Although his character, Dudley is quite the clichéd science geek, it's just fun to see such a serious actor let his hair down. Tim Allen is certainly an actor who it seems is on his way out. The Santa Clause movies are getting worse every time Disney calls on another instalment and he seems to have lost all his past popularity, but finally he seems to have accepted a role that's closer to who he is than not. As a middle aged man, you can see Tim is pretty much drawing from his own experiences of losing his 'coolness' and as such Tim gives out an unusually raw performance for an actor of his calibre. He's still a complete clown but you get a strange vibe when watching him as if he knows what he's on about. Martin Lawrence...I was sceptical about this film due to Lawrence. I can't think of a good film he's been in since Bad Boys. But for once, Martin actually puts in a worthy performance and seems to enjoy playing around. There's not much else to add. He's not exceptional. But he's better than usual. John is just cool, as ever. And as a character that has a habit of f--cking up, he shows a good goofball side that I've never seen before. It's not like it's down to an art as such but it's just nice to see Travolta stray from his 'cool character' persona that he usually adorns.Now generally, I've not been following this film much but after a little research I'm struggling to see what's with all the criticism. The cinematography in this film is standard and the music fits the mood. The script is admittedly, sub par but the actors manage to bring all that together. Also, it's sad to admit it but there doesn't feel like there is actually any direction going on at all I get the vibe that the cast and crew all know what they're doing and that Walt Becker is just there to say ""Action"" and ""Cut"". Generally, I think that the film is fun because I saw it with an open mind. It's got a very used, cliché idea but the actors and a few hilarious points do well at holding it together. It's nothing great, but it's fun.Generally, see the film with an open mind. It's not original but some great performances make it worth seeing. Don't expect a new Monty Python troupe, but just try and enjoy.",Wild Hogs

It has romance, well, a little not a lot and the comedy is a sure fire! William H. Macy steals the show and the rest come up to follow quite close. A terrific movie even for those who don't know what HOGS stands for! The adventure and the mishaps are the greatest things known to cinema's and it really stands out for this picture. If you're a sane person who fell in love with sick humor like Austen Powers, or Without a Paddle then you'll definitely love Wild Hogs. People who like the classic comedies with nothing but belly laugh's o' fun for a night will most definitely love this. I guarantee that if you love 1 of the actor's in the movie, that the rest of the cast will warm out to you. I didn't think I'd like William H. Macy but it turns out he was my favorite from the very beginning. From the exposition to the end credits you'll still be laughing and engaging in small talk about your favorite parts!This is going to be one of the films you and your families will watch throughout history. It's the movie that the lines are memorable, the actions are funny, the dialog is quirky, and come on, a film about four friends ready to recapture their youth, well that's just an awesome plot!Not recommended for small children as there are some scenes that would scar them to death, or put them in intensive care for a couple years!From a fan to a fan, rent this.",Wild Hogs

Given the nature of the script one suspects the writer & director of this bomb are pretty much oblivious to T&A, at least of the sort normally associated with women.However, I did actually laugh at one point, though I can't now recall at what.

Instead, it is simply there to entertain, and for a change, the movie realizes that. It doesn't try to do too much, it doesn't try to go to a deep, new place. Instead, it simply tries to entertain and to make you laugh. In doing so, it succeeds.However, the movie is far from perfect. The premise is simple... its a road trip movie where there are some awkward happenings (John C. McGinley in a vastly different role from Dr. Cox on Scrubs and a very funny instance involving a family swimming hole) and a bad guy that they come across in their travels. Reasonable, and funny. However, the ending is way too clichéd for me, and that is why the movie doesn't get a higher rating. I know that in a movie like this, I shouldn't be looking for a great ending. However, this one feels as though they simply were running out of time and tried to wrap it up in as happy of way as possible.As far as the acting, none of the performances were outstanding. The writing had the roles be limited and slapstick, and the actors delivered. William H. Macy was probably the best, although that probably has to do with the fact that his character is the only one with any depth to it at all. Tim Allen, John Travolta, Martin Lawrence, Marisa Tomei, and Ray Liotta all give decent performances, but nothing worth writing home about.It was a fun movie, no doubt about it.

I wasn't necessarily disappointed but at the same time i don't think it was wonderful. It was sort of bland. Many old played out jokes, many of which fell flat. The plot line was feel good, very predictable but gave you a kinda warm fuzzy feeling at the end. I think the two best performances and funniest parts of this film are Hector Jimenez as a store clerk and Kyle Gass as a singer at the Chile festival. I do think that this film is geared more for middle aged people, mainly men which may be why i didn't enjoy it as much, i'm a 21 year old.

I went to this movie because I was bored and told my family that it was supposed to suck but let's just get out of the house. I am glad we did because this turned out to be one of the best movies I've seen in a long time! My wife couldn't stop laughing and now I want to buy a motorcycle and drive out west even though I never rode in my life. At 51 I'll probably never do it but I can dream. The main criteria I use to judge a good movie is if it sticks in my head for a long time. This is definitely doing that. Another attribute of this movie that I do not see very often is that there are absolutely no down times, that is, something interesting is always going on and you can't wait for the next scene. This movie is exactly what I needed to get me out of this depressing winter doldrums!",Wild Hogs

So funny!!!!!,9,10 July 2008,"First of all, this movie was about 5 times funnier than I expected. second, I almost peed myself 2 or 3 times watching this movie, as well as nearly crying near the end, and third, the acting was great. When I first saw previews for this movie, I knew I HAD to see it. The ad is funny itself. I could NOT stop laughing! It's probably one of my top 5 movies I've seen. I would have given it a 10 but I was getting sick of all the swearing about 2/3 of the way through the movie. It's a great movie for kids 11 or over, and my grandparents were even lol. Funniest movie in the whole world. The funniest (maybe even best) movie of 2007!!!",Wild Hogs
162,croydonlion,Wild Hogs!!,10,14 December 2014,"Yessss! Wild Hogs... What can i say? a modern film about peoples love for bikes! not many others out there! I really enjoyed this film, as there were a lot of laughs, and a few moments of tension. Drew me in from the start! Good acting was key into this film being a success, and they nailed it! I would love to see a sequel to Wild hogs, as this one was a great success. Same sort of humor as The Hangover and Horrible Bosses. I rated this film a 10/10, as it had a hell of a lot of laughs, a great storyline, and a passion for bikes. Quality movie...",Wild Hogs
163,badwrench13,Words fail me,1,20 April 2008,"I felt insulted by this movie (I hesitate to use the term ""film"" here). Not only as a movie lover, but as a biker as well.Far too many clichés. They are all there, too. The RUB (Rich Urban Biker), the hard-drinking tattooed bad-ass, the wannabe bad-ass. Nowhere in sight is the ordinary blue-collar Harley rider such as myself. It even had the obligatory tasteless gay cop jokes.Plus, the appearance of the cycle-whores from OCC, playing their usual roles, themselves-as-themselves. Please. Haven't we had enough of these two? They have their own show already!As well, there was the old ""trickles of gas from the bad guys' bikes blows up their bar"" routine, which, aside from being chemically and mechanically (given the nature of Harley's fuel valves) impossible, has just been done to death. The huge explosion in the action-comedy just seems like a last-ditch effort to save a sinking ship.Let it go, please. Bikers don't need a worse reputation from movies such as this.

He just can't pull off either vulnerable or scared. He also didn't seem very invested in the role, going through the paces with a near ""it's the contract I signed so I have to do it"" disinterest.The other three guys were spot on, although the typical Martin Lawrence persona is quickly becoming (becoming?) repetitive and ""been done to death"". Bill Macy's performance by comparison deserves a ten all by itself. Know who would have been light-years better than Travolta? Adam Sandler.

I cannot remember laughing this much from the beginning to the end of a movie. If you need a good pick me up in the midst of mid-life garbage, then this is the movie for you! It is a great way of looking at yourself and seeing what you would like to do but are too scared to do it! As a 40 something guy, it's good to see that there are other guys my age who are ""wanna be's"" that need more out of life than what we are given. Go out and get what you want before it's all gone!

I thought the actors portrayed their characters with authenticity.I especially liked the scene of John Travolta (Woody) and William Macy (Dudley) practicing dancing together. Yes, as mentioned before, some scenes were somewhat predictable, but I got what I wanted, which was a lot of laughing out loud. It's entertainment, folks, we don't always need a meaningful script. Sometimes we just want silliness to escape from reality, and these guys handled it with finesse.I'm sure they had a great time filming, and ""behind the scenes"" is probably where the REAL action was!Except for a few profanities and partial nudity, it may be acceptable for some kids to watch.",Wild Hogs

This moved so slowly and wow, what unrealistic, poor comedy. I am surprised Travolta has sunk to this level.The plot is totally weak-sauce! I mean its 100% predictable, which is not usually a problem in most comedies but this, wow, really bad.The movie is in limbo between totally off the wall Home Alone style humor (where the main characters get mortally wounded ever 2 minutes on screen with successive jokes) and some sort of realistic Seinfeld humor. With that said, the limbo totally kills it.Do yourself a favor and wait till you can rent it for $0.99",Wild Hogs

This movie is not even funny,the only funny part is the home makeover ending with Ray Liotta. And what the hell is this little kids rumbling at the end ? Gimme a break ! I'm glad REAL Hell's Angels sued this film.

Great actors, fine music, open road and choppers, that's all we need to make a good road trip movie. Travolta, Allen, Lawrence and Macy were great choices to play these four middle-aged men. William H. Macy's role as a hopeless lonely computer geek was very funny. I don't often really laugh in the movies but this time I did. Music was also what you could expect from this kind of film. I recognized at least few songs: JJ Cale; they call me the breeze, Bon Jovi;wanted dead or alive, Beach Boys; Good Vibrations.... but not Born to be wild this time. I also noticed Kyle Gass from Tenacious D in a very special role :)There was also the Teutuls from the TV-show American Chopper. That was a pleasant surprise.

A patient vulture.Unfunny scenes: All the riding, the jokes, the 4 main characters. At least the ""Del Taco's"" are real. Ray Liotta and Marissa Tomai deserved to roar off into the sunset together.

171,michaeljaeproject,Letters From A Critic,4,28 May 2007,"Dear Brad Copeland and Walt Becker and the crew at Touchstone Pictures, I just wanted to let you know I saw Wild Hogs and it was a kids movie that I wished had legs that would have walked off the screen along with the good sense of the people who made it. Your choice of a cast was definitely one that was thrown together and had absolutely no chemistry. I don't buy Martin Lawrence's character in the movie. Sure it was fun to see ""Martin and Pam"" reunite for one more re run of Martin, but I didn't feel that it fit with the movie. The same goes for Mr. Scientologist himself, John Travolta. I think that this movie was too kiddie like for the two of them, and you guys you should have thought about that before infesting movie theaters with your romper room motorcycle gang gag you played on moviegoers for the modest price of $8.50. Sure, I like the idea of four middle aged guys with nothing left in life going on a crazy road trip, but it was executed poorly as a movie that could have been a winner in a quest to relate to middle aged men, turned out to be a fiasco that the kids could show up to. Grant it, you were obviously looking for a family friendly movie. But don't you think you could have raised the bar? If four guys are going to go out, they are not going to go swimming naked in the waterfall. They are not going to hang out at the town festival, and they sure as hell are not going to wear silly ass patches on the back of their jackets. Tim Allen is still stuck in the mold of Tim ""The Toolman"" Taylor and will most likely be in that place until he dies, but William H Macy gave a funny performance which made the movie watchable. I thought the idea of Ray Liotta being the leader of a motorcycle gang was a gag you played on me. Nevertheless, the movie was fun for the kids in the audience, and somewhat watchable for myself. The problem with Wild Hogs is that it is one of these typical Disney movies that feels it has to prove some kind of lesson in life. You want to teach people how to stand up and fight, remake Stand and Deliver. You want to show the difficulties of a marriage, watch the War of the Roses. Don't make this movie sound like it is going to be four guys going out on their road trip being wild and crazy when it is anything but that. Especially when one of the guys is a Wifi espresso drinking pansy who ends up being the stud of the group, typical happy movie ending. Guys, I don't buy happy movies. I think America is sick of happy movies, but it was a good effort at making America more stupider one theater at a time. Buy yourself two glasses of merlot for me gentlemen.

172,davearnott,One of the best films of 2007,10,27 September 2007,This film is brilliant it has every thing right cast script and bikes. It has a all star cast of John Travolta (Grease) Tim Allen (Santaclause 3) Martain Lawrence (Bad Boys) and William H Macy (Jurassic Park 3). The idea of three middle aged men on classy bikes riding across America opens up a load of opportunity's with the cast and script like that you can do anything. It is hilarious and you see a funny side of John Travoltas acting. If you want to see Americas countryside then watch this film you see a lot of it. one of the best films I have ever seen!!!!!!! You see a kind of love story as William tries to get a girlfriend and you see that John only has his friends Martain is afraid of his wife and Tims son thinks hes not cool so they have to sort those problems out too.,Wild Hogs
173,ssoniclee,Very Good,7,22 May 2012,"This film is one of the great comedies of modern film. It has lots and lots of gags and 99% are funny. Occasionally, there are one or two bad jokes that didn't make me laugh but nothing is perfect. The film is an enjoyable experience. Also, I was happy that it was only 1 1/2 hours long because that means that the film doesn't run on too long and overdo the jokes. The only bad things are that it takes a good 15-20 minutes to properly get into the film and that a few jokes are lacking in humour.Overall, I thought it was a great,enjoyable and hilarious film. I'd recommend it to anyone with a sense of humour.",Wild Hogs

Films like this I can only question how it got past the early production stage, and why the actors and producers might have thought that cutting their losses is a better option than having this stain on their careers. This stinker may even have had an effect on sending Harley purchases the wrong way down the highway. Don't waste your time.",Wild Hogs

While the movie was about middle aged men, I found it to be very enjoyable for everyone. It was funny and fun from beginning to end. With each of the main character's different situation, I felt they were easy to connect with. As far as content I felt it was it was mild enough to enjoy without being distracted by uncomfortable moments. However, there is one scene where you see several naked men from behind, which could be awkward for some viewers. Overall, it was an enjoyable getaway from life, and the whole theater was filled with laughter throughout. Enjoy!!",Wild Hogs

Boy what a pleasant surprise!The basic plot of a bunch of friends having mid-life crisis and taking action is the frame work. But, boy oh boy, did they dress it up!The first few minutes introduces us to the characters in a short but effective manor. The next 2/3 of the script is written in the same manor as 'Six Sense'. Every line has multiple meanings and they worked hard to make it work both ways. We were in stitches!They round it off in typical Hollywood style - unbelievable ending - but they make it work and the message is loud and clear.The humor reaches those aged early teens on up (definately aimed at middle aged America). Younger viewers won't understand it all, but there is enough slap stick to keep them entertained.Great Family Film!",Wild Hogs

Good, plain old funny. Making straight-up funny jokes like peeing on the side of the road and phrases like ""...If we're gonna drink p***, we're gonna drink it cold!"".A couple hilarious scenes with Ray Liotta as a VERY bad boy as he usually plays and John C. McGinley (Dr. Cox from Scrubs). And he looked VERY good in that highway patrolman uniform.I would have liked to have heard Tim Allen let out one of those simian growls like on Home Improvement and seen Jon Travolta dance a little. Of all the roles in the movie, I think William H. Macy got the best one. He had the best jokes and physical comedy.So ignore the and 'professional' critics and ask someone who actually saw it",Wild Hogs

I have been riding for more years than I care to count, and I see a lot of people I know in these four. Weekend warriors, dressed the part, but don't understand the mystique, or the true meaning of life. Which is why they decide to shag-ass out of Ohio and head west to see the Pacific Ocean on their bikes. They encounter a very strange motor cop, scare the hell out of a yuppie family in the old swimming hole, the lamest excuse for a biker gang, and a beautiful diner owner. John Travolta's character, Woody (no relation to Tim Allen's other co-star, Woody the Cowboy toy) manages to blow up the biker gang's hangout/bar which results in the Wild Hogs being marked for death. Ray Liotta is at his bad-boy best as Jack the leader of the Del Fuego gang. It has been a long time since I laughed so hard. The only reason I only gave it a 9 out of 10 stars is I noticed that early in the movie, they all managed to ride and accelerate while pulling on the clutch levers. Neat trick.",Wild Hogs

I felt the chemistry between the stars was lacking and many of the sets were contrived. This film reminded me of a low budget made for TV effort and was as predictable as the day is long. I tried to eat my popcorn and treat the movie as pure fluff, but I kept thinking - would I like to be on this road trip with these guys? The answer was a resounding NO. I won't say it was all bad, and there were several funny scenes, but this is not one I would see again.",Wild Hogs

Not only where the characters sympathetic, they each had vastly different personalities that mesh well together. Tim Allen, perhaps drawing from real life, plays an excellent man trying to rediscover himself through a midlife crisis, Travolta plays his I'm a baby comedy routine well, Macy is good as always, and Lawrence is just a little better than you expect him to be. The supporting cast was terrific and when it comes down to it, despite almost astonishingly poor reviews, the film made all kinds of money.

I was let down, however, by knowing what was about to happen every time something funny was about to go down.There was also an enormous amount of potty humor in this movie. There were at least three road-side scenes of the guys ""relieving"" themselves. There was one scene where they all got naked together.I also did not find all the gay jokes funny. A few are okay, but this movie kinda went overboard. I found the gay cop annoying, even more so when they showed his backside.If you find predictable potty humor funny, you will love this movie.If seeing a preview-spoiled movie with tons of gay and potty humor will annoy you, avoid it like the plague.",Wild Hogs
183,xidizzyix,"Excellent, humorous, entertaining film.",9,16 July 2009,"This is one of those films that if/when it comes on TV you are glad you watched it. It makes you smile all the way through, although this isn't exactly A-grade comedy there are some very funny elements.It's a story about middle-aged men that have a problem with their life. There is the man who is scared of his wife (Martin Lawrence), the man who can't relate to his son (Tim Allen), the man who has lost all his money (John Travolta) and the man who can't talk to women (William H. Macey).All actors do a terrific job, and are hilarious in their own right. Perhaps William's character relies on slapstick humour a bit too much, but it fits with the tone of the movie. John Travolta is hilarious throughout. You actually can't wait for his character to return on screen he does such an excellent performance. If you watch the trailer there is an amazing 'laugh out loud' moment involving him and a boy raking his leaves.There are parts of this film where it actually feels like a 'Road Trip' like movie. The gay policeman, the rowdy bikers, the woman etc.This film is also beautiful to look at. The biking scenes are filmed through lush and vivid landscapes.This film only has one flaw as far as I'm concerned and that's the summed up ending. It feels rushed in a way and doesn't properly tie together what happens to the characters.Martin Lawrence's character, along with William H. Macey's, have a proper ending. But Tim Allens character, as well as John Travolta's you are left wanting more. Which is why I can't wait for Wild Hogs 2!

It got my mind off of some things, and was worth the ticket price... but this movie was honestly a waste of time. The whole movie seemed like a slightly more slap-stick version of RV. Wild Hogs seemed like a kids movie, with many unfunny sexual puns. The only funny parts involved Kyle Gass or Dr. Cox from scrubs. The jokes seemed too mature for such an immature movie. Had the movie had a better plot, better development, and such, the jokes could have been very funny, had they been re-tweaked.

The story starts with 4 middle-ages men who decide to re-unite with their motorbikes and go for a long ride across America!

Not only from ourselves, but from the entire audience in the theater! Everyone was enjoying it, and it showed.Performances from the main characters were well done, the story was 'middle-aged angst' done for the umpteenth time, no doubt, but well executed by the cast.The closing scene run during the end-movie credits added to the insanity/hilarity of it all.

187,jcahlik89,Best comedy of 2007 thus far,7,2 April 2007,"Four well known, middle aged actors succeed in giving moviegoers an exciting break from their mundane lives in the new comedy Wild Hogs.Tired of living in a world of monotony, four best friends (Tim Allen, John Travolta, Martin Lawrence, and William H. Macy) decide to take a cross country road trip by motorcycle. On the way they engage in many hilarious antics including burning down their tent, skinny dipping, and blowing up a biker bar. When the leader of the Del Fuegos (Ray Liotta) finds that the four were the ones to blow up his bar, he vows revenge and hunts them down. The four friends then have to band together like never before to teach the evil bikers a lesson It's refreshing to see the return of four once big name actors to the big screen in a slapstick comedy. Wild Hogs shows a different type of humor than the general public is used to viewing nowadays. The humor is very characteristic of old Allen movies, focusing more on a natural ability to make the audience laugh rather than the blatant use of sex and drug related jokes.Each of the headlining actors plays the stereotype of their character to perfection. Allen is, as always an average everyday male who is tired of being boring. Macy seems incredibly natural in his portrayal of a computer geek who possesses no skill with women. Travolta seems stale as the film begins, but as it progresses and his character grows more insane, his performance feels more natural. Lawrence, as always, produces belly laughs while his character is under the short leash of his wife.Also giving hilarious, yet somewhat random performances are John C. McGinley (Scrubs) as a homosexual highway patrolman and Kyle Gass (Tenacious D in 'The Pick of Destiny') as a singer at a fair.This is an extraordinary comedy that takes many well known and talented actors and blends them with a well written slapstick script.By blending many well known and talented actors with a well written slapstick script, Wild Hogs proves to be the perfect escape from the daily stresses of life.",Wild Hogs

Bad acting, stupid stunts and lines are so cheesy. Martin Lawerence, Ray Liotta, Tim Allen, and especially Marissa Toimei sadly ended their careers with this unfunny flick. It's a real shame. Travolta does any movie he can, and better watch out again in falling out of the Hollywood limelight. It happen before in the early 80's and it's very possible with a another bad one.

I did not laugh out loud once; there were only a couple times where I smiled. The problem is, the humor is so juvenile, and there are very few moments of actual humor. I thought it would be a good break to just see a mindless, funny movie, but it didn't even live up to those expectations. It is a waste of your money and time.

Since I always enjoy Travolta/Tim Allen (Men are Pigs, anyway)/William H. Macy, I said 'sure'. Was really surprised at how GOOD Martin Lawrence is (very natural actor). William H. Macy was great, as ever. He can't do a bad movie. His performances in ""Fargo""/""Boogie Nights"" cannot be forgotten. And Marisa Tomei/Ray Liotta/Peter Fonda.......well, what can you say about each of them? Fantastic actors all. Want a great Peter Fonda movie? Rent ""The Limey"", with oh-so-incredible Terence Stamp.........you will want to see again and again and it will probably be on your ""must keep"" list. The Stamp/Fonda acting is superb and T. Stamp is sexy/spooky/and you can't keep your eyes off the guy! Wild Hogs has its moments and it does have laughs. Some of it is just plain creepy with the special effects. But if you like bikes/bikers portrayed in a very stereotypical way, and can stand some pretty standard jokes, not to mention some pretty funny ones, rent Wild Hogs.

193,bill-1830,Enjoyable,7,20 February 2007,"I just got back from a screening.It is an enjoyable movie if you don't take it seriously. The ending was a tad lame. (How they got out of being killed.) A couple of good riding shots.There is a bit of overacting. John Travolta was not at his best. He did much better in Michael and Broken Arrow.W.H. Macy was the best actor of the bunch, although he did say ""I only ride a Sportster"". (I ride a Sportster) But it was in character.Don't jump out of your seat the second the credits start (hint).Several lines out of the trailer never made it into the movie.I found it enjoyable and fun. Probably more funny for people who ride, than those who don't, although all can enjoy the movie.Additionally, my wife enjoyed it.It will probably sell a few thousand Harleys, and some leather gear.

194,NothingbutComedy,pretty good film,7,20 March 2007,"This was a pretty well done film. The first half was extremely funny and I really enjoyed it. However, the second half of the movie was not nearly as entertaining or funny as I originally expected. Some of the scenes in the second half of the movie seemed to drag on and were not in any way believable or funny. The characters were not consistent. I rate the first half a nine out of ten.The second half of the movie was a five out of ten at the very best. With all the star power this film should have had a much better script. It was the first half of the film, and the acting that carried the show.",Wild Hogs

If you saw him in 'Good Fellas,' then you probably will be very disappointed. He plays an absolute buffoon. William H. Macy embarrasses himself with self-deprecating and ridiculously stupid acts. This guy is not a programmer. He is a retard. Martin Lawrence did not belong in the movie. Travolta had too much of a mid-life crisis. The biker gang Liotta leads is ludicrous. The only way this movie could have been better is if they had all performed a ritual suicide at the end Jonestown style. I give it a 2 for the mere fact that I actually watched it all the way to the end.",Wild Hogs

I hated this movie. the only laughs they could get out of me was having William H. Macy run into a stop sign. It is a shame that such a great cast could be in a movie so horrible. The only reason I am writing this article because I am mad about so many other peoples comments were very positive. Wild Hogs is a movie about 4 old men who want to get away from their home lives and just travel on the open road. Sure sounds like a pretty good plot, and it's got a pretty good cast, must be good. Wrong. I wouldn't go waste your time and go see this nauseating movie. Or maybe you will like it. If you don't know what the word comedy means. If you are reading this I hope you don't say well look at all of the other comments this guy must just be some grumpy old man who hates being happy. Take my advice. I love comedy.

198,moviemaster-11,A fun little comedy,8,4 September 2007,"Wild Hogs sounds like a discovery channel special but, it's actually about motorcycles. Underneath the silly name is a genuinely funny film that most members of the family can enjoy.The story is silly but, has it's some what deep moments. I don't want to give anything away but, it gets pretty violent at the end of the movie which surprised me a bit. The acting isn't much to get excited about but, it was fun to see William H. Macey as the dumb guy for a change. Tim Allen is...well he's Tim Allen. You can't really tell his performances from each other but, he does a fine job in Wild Hogs.There hasn't been many good buddy comedy movies in awhile(except for the Rush Hour series)so it was a welcome change from the epic, drama films being released constantly this year.An interesting note that when I first walked into the theater to watch Wild Hogs I had an uneasy feeling. I couldn't really decide whether some of the jokes were funny or not. The jokes I did get were hilarious but, most of the time it was situational humor which makes me crack up but, in Wild Hogs it wasn't that funny.The humor will appeal to the casual movie goer(One woman in the theater was laughing so hard we had to get the manager to calm her down) but, some might find it more stupid and silly then actually funny.This isn't a masterpiece or a movie people will be talking about years from now but, it's good for what it is. I enjoyed it, hopefully you will too.",Wild Hogs

The worst part, for me, was seeing John Travolta and William Macy in this unfunny,poorly written, and terribly directed mistake. I expect less from Martin Lawrence and Tim Allen...but this wasn't even as good as their TV shows....Ray Liotta...Marissa Tomei...PETER FONDA!!

Same tired gay gags...blah blah blah.There was the typical neat and tidy ending, the geeky guy got the babe, overcame 50 bikers with the help of an obscure appearance from obi-wan of bikers.I expected better from such a good cast.

201,solarsam_7,Its harmless fun...whats wrong with that?,9,28 December 2008,"When Wild Hogs was released it was panned by most critics. So when I went to see this I wasn't expecting much. Instead I was treated to a fine film that never stops entertaining. All of the characters, especially William H Macy do great work with their actors and they all have their own moment in the film. Its hard trying to find something wrong with this film; the balance between physical and verbal comedy is perfect and the storyline is simple yet effective; its something that most men go through in their lives. When I was in the cinema the laughs didn't stop for most of the film. And when I left I was seriously contenplating renting a Harley for a few weeks. Sure this film is never going to win an Oscar but so what? Its still a great ride from start to finish. Wow those Hogs are wild! Great fun 9/10",Wild Hogs

Apart from serious, big-headed film critics (or wannabe film critics), this flick is bay far one of the funniest and entertaining to come out of Hollywood in the past half-decade.Acting is superb, as you would expect from veterans Tim Allen, Martin Lawrence, William H. Macy and John Travolta. The plot is - like most comedies- a little far-fetched, but that being said I think the plot made this movie really fun, assisted with the hilarious lines of William Macy, great direction and excellent overall casting.This is on the must see list.",Wild Hogs
203,ScruffyTheJanitor,haven't laughed so hard at a movie in a while,8,4 March 2007,"First of all, I want to say something about rating a comedy movie. If you go to a comedy, you go there expecting to laugh, you don't look for a gripping plot or something. Simply put, if it makes you laugh, it's worth watching. Wild Hogs is definitely worth watching. There's not a dull moment in it and most of the jokes were really funny. I had tears going down my cheek from laughing so hard during the bull scene you see part of in the commercial! The four guys in this movie are all hilarious, especially Martin Lawrence. Anyway, go see this movie if you're a lighthearted person that knows when to sit back, relax and have a good time and not take a movie so seriously.",Wild Hogs

(SPOILER: if you watched the film, his whole freaking out about blowing up the bar had me in stitches!!!!)It contained many humorous parts - from the amazing 'cameo' by Ray Liotta - who redeemed his bad boy reputation again; to the gay and humorous appearances from the Highway Patrolman played by John C. McGinley (Dr Cox in Scrubs)I would recommend this title to anyone who wants to sit down to a lighthearted, funny, clever movie I would definitely be up for a Sequel!!!",Wild Hogs

I was invited by my brother to see this and was not happy about skipping 300 to see this. Boy was I wrong!! It was hilarious from the start all the way to the end. I have to say William H. Macy carries most of the movie he is the funniest one to me. All the other actors do a great job as well and no one gets more screen time than the other which is great. I was even more surprised seeing John Travolta in a role like this. I never would have though he would do a movie like this. Once I saw it I realized he new that this would be great movie so he signed on. Pleasantly surprised and glad my brother dragged me to see it.

Roeper said this type of road trip, old guy finding himself movie has been done over and over....but this time around I believe this movie had a different type of humor. Small gags that created big laughs. Mostly coming from William H. Macy who was casted PERFECTLY for this role of the bumbling geek. Then again I think this movie was casted great all around!

The most interesting part is watching Mr. Z experiment with his craft.There is not much to say about the story line of this film except that it's a coming of age combination of mid-life crisis, male-bonding situations that weave through the intricacies of being in a relationship, getting older and discovering who you are. I think it's Zombie's weird combination of The Breakfast Club, Easy Rider and The Outsiders.I can think of better ways to spend two hours, but like Predator, Bad Boys 2, Pulp Fiction, Seven, Van Helsing or even Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back, it's always a good time.",Wild Hogs
208,pammoo,Money and time is worth,5,30 October 2007,"Wild Hogs For the first time I liked Martin Lawrence in a supporting role where he acted naturally and entertained thoroughly. Big Momma or Blue Streak couldn't entice me into watching movies until I saw Wild Hogs.The movie is an average entertainer simply because it is slow and targeted at people of age 35-55. I'm 29 and rented because my wife recommended it. Nevertheless I won't say that it disappointed me. There are definitely some funny lines that will make you laugh. This movie is not about a new story line that will keep you guessing but a comedy that will entertain you for 2 hours.Ray Liotta and his supporting characters make the movie more enjoyable for I haven't seen Ray in a funny movie in a long time. William H. Macy, Tim Allen and John Travolta also add on to the humor.I don't know if this can be considered as a family movie as there are some debatable scenes but then censorship has been relatively eased over the decades.",Wild Hogs

This movie was full of predictable and done-to-death pratfalls and one-liners. The audience roared to see grown men urinating at the roadside. Oh come on. The film was cheesy and incredibly stupid. Travolta wasn't even 'all there', and Tim Allen seems to play the same persona whether he is in the Santa Clause or Home Improvement. The only redeeming role was played my William J. Macy, who pulled off a charmingly naive and bumbling computer geek turned wannabe biker dude. I was bored by the campiness of this movie, and can't help but think these big name actors are laughing all the way to the bank for luring us into shelling out a $10 bill to sit through such inane trash.",Wild Hogs

I think too many reviewers expected some sort of comedic Odysseus or a bunch of guys who are funny but find a ""deeper"" side of life. It's just goofy. Sight gags come off well, William Macy was a riot, and the ""plot"" (what there is of it) came off fine. Don't buy the negative hype. After a long day of serious writing, this is a great way to unwind. Be sure to stick around for the credits at the end. Oh. This would not be appropriate for 14 and under. There were way too many obscenities and too many jokes with sexual innuendo. It's too bad because they really weren't necessary. Go, relax, have fun.",Wild Hogs

It was not only slow to start, to establish the characters and the point, but the gaps between actual gags that raised more than a faint smile were huge. The majority of the film rotated around gay jokes which could be spotted by a blind man a mile away. But the saving grace was that the usual puns concerning the only black member of the group were avoided. Another disappointing factor was the 'oh so didn't see that coming' policeman - who was just Dr Cox, from Scrubs, in a policeman's uniform, almost as though Scrubs were filming next door and the actor didn't have time to get out of the Dr Cox character. Anyway, I believe that I have said enough - enjoy the film.",Wild Hogs

Can't wait for the violence channel so I can watch ""Ow, My Balls!"" I have read some other user reviews and I must say that it is making me confused as to what I should look for in a quality movie now. One statement that seems to be popping up everywhere in the good reviews is this, ""It was a good movie. Sure it didn't have a great plot, the characters are clichéd, the jokes are predictable, but it's still a good movie."" Everything in the ""Sure it didn't have"" part usually make me stay away from movies because it indicates a bad movie. Apparently those things don't matter anymore. I mean look at how well this movie did opening weekend, 38 million! Why in god's name did this make that much when Zodiac made less then half of that.I have an honest to god question to everyone that saw this movie. Did you watch the trailer? I currently work at a movie theatre. I was entering a theatre to see if it was out yet, but to my shock and horror the crowd was applauding when the credits rolled! This movie is free for me to see and it still terrible and I am much more easy going on movies now that I don't have to pay. What is wrong with this world that people were applauding this pile of guano.As an aspiring filmmaker, I sat there thinking, ""If I took the entire movie and tried to make my own trailer for it, could I make it even look good?"" The answer...is no. I also have figured out how to get into the business so people will give me money. I have to make a terrible movie first, then I will get money to make a real movie because everyone in America will see the crappy movie. I could work, I mean, the guys that made all the scary movies, date movie, and epic movie keep getting money, why wouldn't I? Anyways, now you all see where I stand and I hope you will see that we need to make it so quality films are made again or the few that are made at least make money.

I suppose Macy and Travolta decided to wallow in some quick cash and the heck with a decent project. Martin Lawrence is the new Steppin' Fetchit with his demeaning shuck and jive antics in full force. Ray Liotta has done some good things in his career, but I suppose he is at the point now that he has to take whatever is thrown his way.This movie is full of every cliché in the mid-life crisis book. It looks like it was written in about an hour and was an episode for some very bad sit-com. Was this in the theaters about a week? How does a movie like this even get made?",Wild Hogs
214,rbaar,Looking for an escape from your life? Take a time-out,7,24 February 2007,"I attended a pre-release screening of the movie in Philadelphia, and I went in expecting a lot of zany sequences, funny violence and a truckload of laughs, and I wasn't disappointed.Messrs. Travolta, Allen, Lawrence and Macy fit their parts well, and while the story doesn't demand a lot from the actors, they are good as middle-aged professionals tired of their boring lives. The film's theme is a road-trip across America on Harley-Davidson's, with leather jackets (""Wild Hogs"" is what they call themselves) and all the other paraphernalia. The whole movie is littered with stereotypes and clichéd characters and plots, and this lends an air of predictability to it. Some people might say that it's closer to an animation, given the generous helpings of crashes and falls, but then I didn't find it to be a put-off because it doesn't pretend to be an action film. You fall, you look funny, you get back up, and story moves on.At the outset, I thought that there might be a resemblance to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, with it's concept of two tired guys out to discover the American Dream, but it isn't so. The humour is rib-tickling at times, and mostly slapstick. Among individual performances, nobody really steals the screen, but the overall chemistry between the Wild Hogs is good. Ray Liotta plays the bad guy with an overdose of menace, and Marisa Tomei did a good job of looking pretty. Some of the cinematography is breathtaking, but for a road trip across America, there was very little of variety in location.I won't advise spending $15 on it in a theater, but it'll be a fun watch with friends, when the DVD comes out, much like how I would judge Eurotrip.",Wild Hogs

One example is... *spoiler* I mean no one can get hit by a bull like that and get up totally fine with no pain. Yes, it was funny but so not real. I mean Doug and Bobby were thrown up into the air and landing directly on their backs. And they walked off laughing. Hmmm, yes I know its a movie but still.But anyways, I think you should go see it.

216,Randel-ClerksX,Brilliant Movie,10,21 April 2007,"This is 1 of my favorite films ever,, its about Woody Stevens (John Travolta), Doug Madsen (Tim Allen), Bobby Davis (Martin Lawrence), and Dudley Frank (William H. Macy) are four successful middle-aged suburban men in Cincinnati who find themselves frustrated with the pace of daily life. Woody is a formerly rich businessman who now finds himself alone and bankrupt. Doug is a dentist who can't connect with his son and misses his college glory days when he was called ""The Golden Knight."" Bobby is a plumber who's often bossed around by his wife. Dudley is a computer geek who seeks to find a woman in his life. Their one collective hobby has always been to ride together on motorcycles around the city. They even have leather jackets with their biker gang name, ""Wild Hogs,"" stitched on the back.After Woody finds out that his marriage is ending in divorce and that he's bankrupt, he suggests that the Wild Hogs embark a cross-country road trip on their bikes to seek adventure. After some hesitation from the three others, the four agree to the trip and set off on their Harley-Davidsons.The road trip is filled with humorous moments. For example, when they cosily sleep close to each other, scantily dressed, a policeman (John C. McGinley) tells them this is lewd and lascivious behavior, but it turns out that he is only teasing: he is gay and actually jealous. Later the four go skinny dipping, but are very uncomfortable when a family goes swimming. When the family discovers that the four men are naked they feel very uncomfortable too and leave. The policeman appears again; he also undresses and joins the four men, showing sexual interest in them; this makes the four feel uncomfortable again, and now they leave.The fun soon ends when the foursome stops at a small New Mexico bar and stumbles onto a real motorcycle gang called the Del Fuegos. Del Fuego leader Jack (Ray Liotta) tricks the foursome into a bum motorcycle trade, then tells them they should leave before something else bad happens. The Wild Hogs leave the bar without Dudley's bike, claiming they are nothing compared to the motorcyclist who founded them- and built the bar- Damien Blade.Less than a mile away, Woody stops, disgraced at what just transpired. He tells his friends that he will walk back and reason with Jack for the bike. But when Woody gets back to the bar, he builds up his courage and cuts the fuel lines to every gang member's motorcycle in the parking lot before exiting with Dudley's bike. He returns to his friends with the bike (to much astonishment) and explains that he simply threatened the gang with legal action should they not turn over the bike. At the nervous Woody's request, they quickly leave the area. Jack orders his gang to follow the Wild Hogs, but when he errantly tosses a cigarette, it hits gasoline on the ground, which triggers a chain reaction that blows up the entire biker bar. The Del Fuegos swear revenge, getting to work on repairing their vehicles.Meanwhile, because of Woody's insistence that they should not stop dislikes her controlling him and the two reconcile. Doug impresses his son by telling him of the adventures. Dudley says he will return to town soon to enjoy time with Maggie. The four head for the Pacific coast.",Wild Hogs

Sometimes it rains and sometimes you get bugs smashed against your face shield and jacket. Occasionally you ride and everything is perfect (like the pictures you see on motorcycle ads). To a real motorcyclist, you are willing to put up with all those discomforts to enjoy the freedom of the ride. Motorcycles do not have climate control and a sound proof cabin with a built in entertainment system. People who need those things will never get motorcycling and they will never get this movie. This movie is about 4 middle aged guys who realize what they have been doing for the past 20 years is exactly what they will be doing for the next 20 years.....and then they will grow old and die. Doug, Bobby, Dudley and Woody make the decision that they are going to leave their continual, hum-drum existence for a week or two and do something different for once in their lives. Can they escape their mundane lives long enough to actually get free? People who are happy to run out their lives just doing the same thing over and over again will never get Wild Hogs.

You did know where the flaming Marshmallow would. Scene at the biker bar set up Ray Lolita Character, All of sudden you got to see the Henry Hill Character laugh from Goodfellas. The small town sequence set up, the Sheriff and deputies very nice and the conflict with the Biker Gang.

224,taylor_deborahleah,Laughed and Laughed and laughed !!!! Great Fun,10,2 March 2007,Like so many others in the Theater I could not stop laughing. Even when tears were abundant running down my cheeks and my side hurt. Luckily everyone else was just as loud with laughter so I was not the only laughing fool in the place. With this group I didn't know quite what to expect as sometimes they are funny and sometimes not so much. The antics and the character actors in this film was PURE genius. It has the type of humor for everyone. Must see and Must DVD buy. Glad to see at least one good movie for 2007. Tim Allen and John Travolta who would have thought ? The big surprise in the film was William Macey. I din't realize the guy could be that funny. He played to comic goof and pulled it off with flying colors. Hats off to all.,Wild Hogs
225,josespi,loved the film and highly recommend it to everyone over the age of 40!,10,3 March 2007,"I sat through this film with tears in my eyes, it was one of the most entertaining and comical films I've seen in a long time and was extremely pleased with the story line. The best, and most important part, to me is that it's pure entertainment, you don't have to think, there are no sub-plots, just some good old ""road runner"" type gags and entertainment. I own a Harley and ride with a ""gang"" that my wife calls the ""Old Farts Gang"" and this film could have been a chronicle of us and some of our adventures. I highly rate this film and truly enjoyed it. Allen, Travolta, Lawrence and Macy look and act like real people in everyday life. In fact, I do believe Macy just played himself and drew on his own life's experiences for this film. Of course, the film is weak at times in the plot but that is overshadowed by the rest of the storyline.",Wild Hogs

Well, that movie critic obviously doesn't understand middle age humor! Our adult son went with us to see the movie and he was laughing as much as us. If you've ever owned a motorcycle, ever wanted to own one but never did, ever been just the rider on the back...you should enjoy watching this. Usually a OK to good comedy will have some slow moments to sit through. With ""Wild Hogs"" almost every scene has a laugher. Everyone in the theater was laughing THE ENTIRE movie.

While the movie may have been predictable in many scenes, it was pure fun!! Travolta appeared to just have fun with this movie as did Allen and Lawerence. I had to work a little harder to accept Macy in this movie. There were larger homophobic tones than I would have like to see and a few more male parts that, at this age, could have been omitted. The roar of the pipes and the freedom of the ride is the true meaning of this movie and should be enjoyed as such. I understand that the ""critics"" are not thrilled with it but perhaps they have not had the opportunity to get out and ride....perhaps they should try and it would allow them to have a fresh perspective as to the basis for this movie.Well done cast and stunt doubles!!!!",Wild Hogs

Local reviewer panned it, but his review reads like he didn't see the movie (of course, it wasn't in Urdu with Japanese subtitles). ""Lose the watches"" is a great line, I hadn't even noticed they were wearing them. I would have liked to see more of Marisa Tomei. I'm looking forward to seeing how it stands up to a second viewing. I can see a sequel with no sweat. At first I was thinking City Slickers on bikes, but the films turned out to be quite different in their resolutions. The movie could have been longer without any problem, I'm looking for the DVD extras. Good job by all.",Wild Hogs
229,cedje,Mild Hogs - Please don't put money in Travolta's pockets.,3,4 March 2007,"Predictably disappointing for me. Middle aged Midwest mom's, including my wife, should (and did) enjoy. Also, if you're a male, 11-16, and enjoy jokes revolving around bodily functions and homophobia you're going to love this movie. EVERYONE else please stay home, watch it on DVD and don't reward John Travolta and Tim Allen for another movie-mill POC like I did. Better yet re-rent City Slickers instead, it is much funnier and the plot isn't a Swiss cheese and ham sandwich.If you have never read a single review of this movie and you saw the 'all A-list cast' you might expect a lot more from this oinker. However; there were only a few supporting performances worth mentioning. One is an over the top, tongue in cheek, funny Ray Liotta as the leader of the ruthless Del Fuegos. The funniest lines of the movie were delivered by Ray's right-hand man (Kevin Durand) as the confused ""Red."" Lamentably, I was the only one laughing during these scenes. (Also note Peter Fonda's cameo went completely unnoticed and/or unappreciated by the crowd I saw it with.) Marissa Tormei is alright and, while she is only in the last 1/3 of the movie, develops the only believable character in this stinker. I was quite disappointed William Macy even choose to roll in this swine slop with Martin Lawarence and Tim Allen who virtually live here. I'm also quite certain this was somehow engineered from the mind of Travolta.John McGinley (Scrubs - Dr. Cox) and Steven Toboloksky (Groundhogs Day - Needle-nose Ned) were relatively predictable in their trademarked characters, but not disappointing.The story/script were almost none existent and completely riddled with glaring goofs (maybe intentionally, either that or terrible editing - I'm going with the latter.) Visually the movie was pretty good (else I wouldhave gone all the way down to a 2 of 10.) Nothing impressive, but a budget can do wonders for a flicks visuals. (Could a studio please just once give this kind of funding to a SunDance winner or any movie with a plot? Nah- that would mean soccer moms would have to think for 90 minutes.) However; in the end I would say a good 75% of the audience (mostly mid-aged men themselves and their wives) seemed to have a ruckus good time so I'm sure we're bound to be served up another meal from the trough next off season - Wild Hogs 2 ""Del Fuegos visit Cincinnati."" Take your early teen kids(they're exposed to a lot worse every day in school) and enjoy your stupid movie.PS- As far as the all the homophobia and John T.- I'm sure this is a cry for help.

This movie is hilarious, kind of a mix between ""City Slickers"", ""The Three Amigos"" and ""Blazing Saddles"", the whole theater audience was laughing throughout the entire movie including a bunch of teenagers in front of us, and everybody applauded at the end.

I am going to ride from the pacific to Ohio myself. My 14 year daughter and her friends thought the movie was funny also and 14 year old think everything is ""LAME"". My daughter keep saying how the movie seemed so short because it was to funny and the movie was 2 hours it just went by really fast.

The only thing I got out of this picture, in addition to the fact that Martin Lawrence should hang it up, is that I wasted 5 hard-earned dollars! People, save your money. Buy a greasy cheeseburger meal at a fast-food joint, and it will be money better spent. William H. Macy, naked, playing the quintessential queen, flirts with fellow actors Tim Allen, John Travolta, and Martin Lawrence in a pool of water, under a waterfall, at a State Park. My skin was crawling. All the while, Lawrence continuously making references to his ""big black python."" Did I mention, they were all naked? Bluntly put, the acting was horrible, and the script was terribly written.Being a huge fan of a doll like Marisa Tomei for so many years, I found myself giving her the only leniency out of the bunch. I assumed she was doing this sacrificially to get the exposure the rest of the big names in this movie bring. Like the luscious Phoebe Cates, I don't want to see her go. But C'Mon Marisa?! After well-acted movies like Unhook the Stars, Untamed Heart, and Only You, you're heading down the path of whack ex-actresses that are hookin' it in the advertising arena.Save your $5",Wild Hogs

William H Macy shines when most would think it would be the other 3 stars. Familiar faces appear in minor roles from several well known long running TV series aka star gate and lost. Marissa Tomei adds a feminine touch to a masculine cast. Martin Lawrence is his usual self. Travolta and Tim Allen are also amusing.

I can't remember the last time I went to a movie that was as packed as this one that the audience really were engaging into the story and just feeling good while watching a film. The age group that attended this film were from young to old and there wasn't one person that wasn't having a good time. Wild Hogs is a light hearted feel good fun film.

It was a waste of their efforts and my time to have to watch this on the screen - luckily it was a double feature at the drive-in (if you're lucky enough to still have one, drive-ins are tons of fun despite movies like this). Hollywood seems to have a format for these sorts of films - they are all the same, yet people go to see them since they are scientifically formulated for the American public.

For a family movie it had a little too much foul language but still a good family movie. The casting was good and the actors portrayed their parts well. I thought John Travolta was probably the best actor but loved William Macy as ""Dudley"" and all the motorcycle gang. I wished the ending had been a little more thought out but it was alright anyway.

John Travolta and Tim Allen are really the kinda guys you would expect to do something like this in real life :Dalthough the part of Martin Lawrence (nothing against him!! great actor) but when you're making a movie with guys in their midlife-crisis.. why go for Lawrence?? why not go for..

242,bmaholmes,Highbrow's beware but solid entertainment,6,19 December 2007,"Took out the DVD copy and had fun watching this movie - about five or six laugh-out-loud moments. I'm not going to go overboard on the rating, so 6 of 10 is good. There were one or two dry moments that elevated it marginally above typical slapstick animal jokes. There were no fart jokes! At last! I say I enjoyed it and I identified, at least partially, with the characters' mid-life crises. And any movie that features William H. Macy, John Travolta, Martin Lawrence, Tim Allen, Ray Liotta, and John C. McGinley has got to have some moments. John C. McGinley has a fantastic couple of scenes. All of the actors worked their characters well to really elevate the movie, including supporting actors Marisa Tomei, Jill Hennessy, and Tichina Arnold. Stephen Tobolowsky, as the sheriff, also produces a singularly fantastic scene when he meets the Wild Hogs in a diner. This movie was about the characters for me. The plot spoofed other road-trip movies, one or two westerns and there was a Charles Bronson moment too, but all very subtle and not forced. Predictable plot maybe but that's not what this movie's about. Not highbrow in the least but a good evening's entertainment.

Somehow i managed to make it through 50 minutes till i decided to turn it off and put my foot through my new TV. It is incredibly disappointing that John Travolta and the other actors that were in this film even agreed to this appalling script! Where did the writers learn to write?!

It had my wife staring at me in jaw dropping amazement - how do these things get past the first draft - just how desperate are the studios for content that this gets made. There was one (maybe two at a pinch) funny slapstick moment at the start, but as the film progressed the insult to the viewers intelligence increased and any potential amusement evaporated.

Could have done more guy stuff like motorcycle racin, girl watchin & drinkin. Looks like they were required to keep a very sober set due to the cycle riding. If they were shooting for a film to appeal to the family, as the DVD box says. I can't figure out why they made the skinny dip scene which earned it a pg-13. Bonus feature about the actors' riding abilities is good, & behind scenes. Wild hogs has a Buena Vista feel to it, which is may explain the mostly clean, USA-family feel. Yet there's a scene where the USA flag is disrespected (in a minor way). Although minor, it shows how the film misses the mark with a core audience of Harley Enthusiasts.",Wild Hogs

There is no real chemistry between the actors. The plot is thin and predictable. The humor is cheap, with the gay jokes being the most offensive.

Although we felt a certain real appreciation for Bill Macy, we also found that every character was masterfully done. This movie might be a little salty for young viewers, however young adults and old guys like myself can certainly find the hilarious side of each event in their travels.

250,dead_lucky,Serious contenders in the 'Worst Performance since J-Lo in Anaconda' category,1,30 April 2007,"So there are a few problems with the premise for this film in the first place but let's ignore that. Knowing full well that I would hate this film and begrudge the 100 and odd minutes I'd never recoup, I was determined to see it through with an open mind out of respect for the notable cast. What can I say but I did my best.It was apparent from the get-go that these four actors have never spent considerable time together, not that I'd expect them all to be best friends, but the lack of chemistry was exceptional for such an experienced bunch! At times I found myself questioning whether they were all in the same room during filming or we were all being fooled by some impressive CGI. Whilst I'll agree with the majority that Macy certainly gave an acceptable(and sometimes charming) performance, an un-charismatic cast, ridiculous plot, cringe-worthy script and the mediocre, low-brow 'jokes' could not be excused to allow for a 'two or three star -we-appreciate-the-effort' grade.As for the 'comedy' credentials? Other than being devoid of originality the 'comedy' itself was peppered with homo-erotic references common in most recent teenage and adult comedies (to greater success) but alien to the target audience. It could be argued that this was an attempt to emulate the kind of humour demonstrated by the likes of 'The Simpsons', in allowing varying generations to recognise comedy at their own level. To be honest it just cheapened the entire venture and felt so out-of-place it served to confuse rather than entertain.Don't get me wrong I wouldn't say 'Wild Hogs' was a complete waste of time, take one look at the revenue generated in its first week (added to the fact that it keeps the kids quiet for an hour and a half on a rainy Sunday) and I guess we can forgive and, more importantly, forget!",Wild Hogs

And try to imagine what its like to have the wind in your face, flying down Highway 50 across an open stretch of country, not passing another sole for 30 minutes! This movie is really about the true spirit of the American male and the desire to enjoy being ""free"" from the bonds of dull jobs, unappreciative kids, and nagging wives.Sure, the performances are not award winning materials, but that is what makes this movie fun. Watching Travolta, Allen and the gang just have fun. (How could you not have fun around these guys?) It's not ""profound"" or even trendy, but it is worth the price of a ticket.

My hubby is a biker (not part of a gang or group however); combined with the cast (although the four main players haven't always had hit films, what's not to like about them?) we knew it would be funny but not THIS funny. What a neat surprise to see Ray Liotta (love that fiendish laugh of his aka ""Goodfellas"") and Peter Fonda (among others) as part of the supporting cast! Although I feel that William H. Macy had the best role of the main four, they worked together wonderfully - wouldn't mind seeing a sequel. As mean and nasty as the Del Fuegos came off initially, I loved the metamorphosis at the end - especially the bit during the credits - my favorite part of the film, nothing like EVERYONE having a happy ending! (I keep rewinding that last bit...) Some off-color jokes but I would consider this a family film regardless. Don't miss it!",Wild Hogs
259,grpictures,Travolta hits new low,1,3 April 2007,"I'm sorry but Travolta should be ashamed of this role. I tried to like this movie but it was painful to watch. My wife liked it much more than I did but there is no way I could agree with much of what she liked in this film. Considering the fact that the film had some serious ""A"" list actors...it's was a pitiful example of a bunch of stars getting together to have a good ole time making a piece of garbage. This could have been a really good film too. The premise of a group of middle aged guys hitting the road on Harleys has a good feel about it. The music was good too...but the film was a sad case of lots of money and no substance. It reminded me of the Burt Reynolds crap from the 80's...""Cannon Ball Run"". What a waste of time and talent. Sorry!",Wild Hogs
260,andielykes,"Not gut-busting funny throughout, but it had its moments",7,17 January 2018,"I did not read any reviews before seeing this movie. My little brother has this dvd in his collection, and I wanted to watch something before bed to help me sleep, and I had never seen this before so I decided to watch it. I liked it. I'm surprised this is rated so low. Someone on here said this was ""absolute garbage,"" and I have to disagree with that. Martin Lawrence and Tim Allen got the best lines and a few LOL moments, but John McGinley stole the show as the homosexual state trooper. All-in-all, not the funniest movie I've ever seen but absolutely not ""absolute garbage."" Worth seeing on dvd or streaming on Netflix/Hulu.",Wild Hogs
261,suckernogo,Total crap,2,26 September 2007,"This movie was total crap, I can't believe I watched it through to the end. I expected reasonable acting and modestly good humor given the cast. Instead a never ending list of open doors and clichés, my 12-yr old nephew could've written this scenario. Unoriginal by any standard. 4 guys in a midlife crisis hit the road on motorbikes in order to regain their lost youth. If that theme is not lame enough, the concept is diluted further by a series of slapstick like-events turning them from losers to heroes of a sleepy provincial town. I cannot believe Travolta and Macy lent themselves for this stupid scenario. Do not watch unless you are in the 10-13 age range and/or enjoy watching the A-team re-runs.",Wild Hogs
