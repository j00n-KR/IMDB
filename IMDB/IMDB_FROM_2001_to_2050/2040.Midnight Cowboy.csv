0,MartinHafer,"If you are looking for FUN, then keep looking!",7,31 May 2012,"""Midnight Cowboy"" is not the sort of film I'd usually watch. I generally avoid films like this and is the first X-rated film I have seen. However, because it won the Oscar for Best Picture and is considered a classic, I decided to give it a try. For others out there who are also hesitant to watch, understand that the film today would receive an R rating, as there really isn't much nudity in the film at all. However, since the film is about a male prostitute, it still isn't what you'd call 'family friendly'! The film begins with Joe Buck (Jon Voight) leaving his home in Texas. He's headed to New York to make his fortune as a male prostitute. Considering he isn't gay and isn't willing to sleep with guys, that makes his prospects REAL slim. On top of that, he's as dumb as a tomato and walks about town in cowboy gear--hardly the look that will drive women wild (he actually looks a bit like the cowboy from The Village People minus the mustache). Not surprisingly, he goes broke very quickly--partly because no women want to pay him and partly because people keep cheating him because he's so naive. He eventually meets up with a low-life named 'Ratso' Rizzo and the two of them BARELY scrape by--stealing, scamming and living in a condemned building. The film explores themes of fears of homosexuality and rape. It's all very sad and pathetic and isn't at all the sort of film to lift your spirits--particularly the awfully dark ending.So did I enjoy watching the film? No. It's not the sort of film anyone could actually enjoy. It's more a film that is a joint character study--an unpleasant but oddly fascinating one. It's well made but not a film I could heartily recommend--you have to be the sort of person that would enjoy or at least appreciate the film.By the way, you might already have noticed that the Muppet character, Rizzo (the rat), is a play on Hoffman's character from this film. Thank goodness they are alike in name only!",Midnight Cowboy
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Dark, quite poignant and captivating",10,14 April 2011,"This movie is a very fine film with a lot of merits. The film does look great, with beautiful scenery and crisp cinematography and the lighting is very atmospheric and always fits perfectly with every scene. The music is wonderful, with the highlight being the excellent Everybody's Talking', the story is very strong focusing on the friendship of the two main characters and well-paced and the dialogue is thought-provoking and poignant. The direction is top notch using every trick in the book and wonderfully and the characters constantly captivate. And this is helped by the magnificent playing of Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffmann, especially Hoffmann who I personally think should have got the Best Actor Oscar that year. Overall, a truly fine film. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Midnight Cowboy
2,bkoganbing,"""Only The Echoes Of My Mind""",9,22 February 2009,"Midnight Cowboy has the dubious distinction of being the first and only X-rated film ever to win the Best Picture Oscar. Then the rules got changed and mere subject matter alone could not qualify a film for an X-rating. Today the sexual subject matter of this film wouldn't get a passing wink, male prostitution's been done quite a bit on the big and small screen.Through a series of flashbacks we see what's created the character of Joe Buck that Jon Voight plays, living with a rather loose aunt played by Ruth White and finding his true love in Jennifer Salt to be not so true. Women are just sex objects to him, but when he decides to make use of his lovemaking talents in the biggest market of all, New York City, it's Voight who turns out to be the naive one.Although street character Dustin Hoffman is among many who clip this Texan, later on Hoffman and Voight form an unusual bond. Hoffman's Ratso Rizzo is one veteran of the mean streets of New York, in fact he's lived in them for too long. When Voight and Hoffman meet, they don't know it, but Hoffman's health is beyond repair.The pitiable Rizzo and the naive country boy Buck form one of the most unusual male bonding attachments ever brought to the screen. Rizzo is latently gay, but what upbringing he's had has told him that was wrong to have these feelings. Rizzo constantly uses the ""F"" word and rejects any companionship even when it's offered at that Sixties free love party with all kinds of substance aids.As for Buck, he's gay when he's got to be though he hates it because of his upbringing. Note the scene with Bob Balaban making his screen debut in the movie theater when Buck needs money. And later on he robs Barnard Hughes who plays another self-loathing gay man. Hughes is quite good in the role, he could have been a US Senator he was that good.Midnight Cowboy won Oscars for Best Picture, Best Director for John Schlesinger, and Best Adapted Screenplay for Waldo Salt. That last one must have been especially sweet for the formerly blacklisted Salt. John Voight and Dustin Hoffman were nominated for Best Actor, but with the competition being the man who put more people in movie seats than anyone else in history John Wayne, these two newbies didn't stand a chance that year. They both got Oscars eventually, but poor Richard Burton who was also up for Anne Of A Thousand Days never got the gold as did Peter O'Toole who was nominated for Goodbye Mr. Chips.Sylvia Miles was up for Best Supporting Actress as the upper East Side grande dame who polishes off a quickie with Voight and turns the tables on him in the money department. It was Voight's introduction to New York and the scene is just brilliant. It was Miles's career role as an actress although she lost to Goldie Hawn for Cactus Flower. It's the highlight of Midnight Cowboy for me.Midnight Cowboy coming out as it did in 1969 reflects its times quite accurately. It was the end of the Sixties and the Hippie generation, at the same time it was made just as people were rioting in the streets of Greenwich Village for their rights as GLBT Americans. People like Bob Balaban and Barnard Hughes's characters would no longer be the stereotypical self loathing gay men. Midnight Cowboy maybe even more than Boys In The Band is a glimpse of where we've come from.It's not a pretty place, nor is Midnight Cowboy a pretty picture. But Jon Voight, that was indeed one beautiful cowboy.",Midnight Cowboy
3,Leofwine_draca,"Affecting, with a stand-out turn",7,26 November 2019,"MIDNIGHT COWBOY is an interesting, unique, Oscar-winning drama from 1969 that provides an acting showcase for the two leads. It tends to be much better directed than it is written, and there are still murky, strange aspects that don't make a whole lot of sense, the main character's back story for example. However, as a story of social isolation and living on the breadline in a cold-hearted city like New York, this is very nearly up there with the likes of TAXI DRIVER. Jon Voight is fine and convincing as the somewhat naive lead, but the real stand-out is Dustin Hoffman, going fully character in his acting; he should have got the Oscar for this exemplary, scene-stealing supporting turn. As for the social milieu, it reminded me a lot of Steinbeck's work, and is just as affecting.",Midnight Cowboy
4,SnoopyStyle,"Hey, I'm Walking Here!!",9,11 July 2015,"Texan Joe Buck (Jon Voight) quits his dish washing job and heading out east to be a gigolo in NYC. He sees himself as a real ladies man but he's actually quite naive in the big city. He's so naive that he loses money after sleeping with a rich lady. He meets real hustler limping Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) who cons him out of more money. He's so broke that he does gay sex which he again gets nothing for. He runs into Rizzo and they form an odd friendship. Buck is haunted by his past while Rizzo dreams of living in Florida.Jon Voight is great and Dustin Hoffman makes one of the greatest character of all cinema. They form an iconic movie team. It's down and dirty. It's also a bit of fun. There's a good sense of decay in New York. The song ""Everybody's Talking'"" is immediately identifiable to this movie. It's also got one of the most heart breaking final scenes. It is an important American film.",Midnight Cowboy
5,Hitchcoc,Everybody Was Talking,7,6 April 2006,"I appreciated the emotional attachment between the two characters. I thought this was Hoffman's consummate performance. Of course, he had the advantage of getting a really bizarre and complex figure to play. He rants, crossing the streets of New York, looking for coins in a pay phone. He exists. That's about it. One the other hand, we have John Voight who could have stayed behind in Texas, but he's too thick to understand what he's getting into. Everyone considers him a stud, but he just blends right in with every other messed up male prostitute in the city. What they do is the issue. If this had a real well developed plot, it would have been a great movie. The actors work with subtlety, mostly as their friendship continues. It's a love story. But it's a bit barren and sick. I remember that it was rated X when it first came out. It shows how far we've come in our ratings (not all that great in my mind), but this is barely an R rated movie these days. If you want to see actors act and sparks fly, this is your movie. As an overall story beyond that, we really don't have the characters going anywhere with anything. I suspect that the sixties made this movie, the wacko times and the tension. The New York world was so full of itself and Joe Buck was able to infiltrate a bit. But, somehow it left me empty.",Midnight Cowboy
6,mark.waltz,"Voight and Hoffman update the Hope & Crosby movies on their ""Road to Ruin"".",10,5 November 2012,"In 1969 Everybody Was Talking' about this X rated movie which won the Oscar for Best Picture. Having risen to stardom with his role in the ground-breaking ""The Graduate"", Dustin Hoffman followed that up with a character role (a modern day Peter Lorre) opposite Jon Voight being as far a cowboy from John Wayne or Roy Rogers as possible. For Wayne and Rogers, a stud was either something on their boots or a type of horse. But for Voight, it is something else, and he is heading as far away from Texas to be one as he can. So where does he end up? In the Big Apple, where he learns that a midnight cowboy can only work one place-the Port Authority area of Times Square, and it isn't the wealthy society matrons of Park Avenue who are interested in him.In ""Boys in the Band"", a New York City hustler is hired by one of the party guests as a present for the birthday boy, wanting to present this lovably dumb working boy to the guest of honor as his ""Midnight Cowboy"". In ""Midnight Cowboy"", Hoffman humiliates Voight by revealing to him that the cowboy look only works with ""every Jackie on 42nd Street"", calling Voight's appearance ""strictly for fags"". Rizzo isn't being homophobic in this Stonewall era drama; He is just calling it as he sees it. And in spite of everything else, Voight can't help but admire Hoffman for his honesty. An endearing friendship is formulated which is almost a romance in itself.The fascinating Sylvia Miles is unforgettable as the Park Avenue matron who utilizes Voight's services with hysterical results. For her less than ten minutes on screen, Miles was deservedly nominated for an Oscar. Brenda Vaccaro has a memorable brief role as a guest at a party who sets Voight up for other possible paid flings. But the twist that results from this shows where the priorities really end up falling. And when Hoffman and Voight finally do end up on ""the road"", this leads to a sad final where even a street creature like Rizzo is revealed to be a human being. Times Square in this era (and way beyond) was somewhat frightening, and many people despise the way it has been ""Disney-fied"" since then. With ""Hair"" on Broadway at the time, ""Midnight Cowboy"" in the theaters, and the news reports of crime and vice over the airwaves, Manhattan wasn't the family friendly place it is now. Like other legends that have come and gone, it is nice to go back and see the grit that was and regret the middle ground it might have transitioned to.",Midnight Cowboy
7,claudio_carvalho,Depressing Tale of Friendship and Shattered Dreams,8,28 January 2015,"The naive Joe Buck (Jon Voight) quits his job of dishwasher and travels from a small town in Texas to New York expecting to make money as a hustler. On the arrival, he is lured by the crippled crook Enrico Salvatore ""Ratso"" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) that takes some money from him. Soon Joe is broken and homeless without any client or money, and he meets Ratso again on the streets that invites him to move to his apartment in a derelict building. Ratso has a strange cough and his health gets worse. He dreams on moving to Florida where he believes he will be healthy again. Joe and Ratso develop a friendship and Joe decides to go with his friend to Florida as soon as he gets the necessary money. ""Midnight Cowboy"" is a depressing tale of friendship and shattered dreams of losers. In flashbacks, the viewer sees that Joe is raised by his grandmother that neglects him and is raped with his girlfriend, who was actually a slut, by a gang when he is a teenager. Further, his grandmother's boyfriends are cowboys and he has very limited education. Therefore he has a wrong concept of women and love, and believes that he will be a sensation with mature women in New York. Ratso is the son of an Italian immigrant that works as a shoe-shiner and has had problems with his lungs for a long time. These two needy characters team-up to survive on the streets of New York and become better persons through their friendship. John Schlesinger has made a stunning classic that has not aged with an unpleasant story using magnificent screenplay and outstanding cast led by Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight. My vote is eight.Title (Brazil): ""Perdidos na Noite"" (""Lost in the Night"")",Midnight Cowboy
8,kosmasp,The boy in the man,9,24 April 2021,"First things first as I do when I am aware of these things: I have not read the novel this is based on. In other words do not expect me to tell you how close it is to the source material or what may be different in the movie. That out of the way I can tell you that I really dig the main theme song (which some may know, very well known and quite the coup to get it for the movie too) and I really dig the actors in this one too.The story this tells is a story of someone still being in his shell ... some may even say still being a boy in a sense. He is very gullible for sure. Even though or maybe because of his past ... one incident can make you lose faith (no pun intended) or just go crazy in a way - or just withdraw and make you choose a life that maybe isn*t necessarily for you.It took me long enough to watch this - a movie that is considered rightfully a classic. It is a testament of the time it was made - and that is not meant in a bad way at all.",Midnight Cowboy
9,classicsoncall,"""You're gonna be the best lookin' cowboy in the whole parade"".",10,9 April 2011,"Good old boy Joe Buck (Jon Voight) and street con Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) form an unlikely alliance in this Oscar winning hit from director John Schlesinger. It's not what one would consider a buddy movie, far from it, but over the course of the picture, Voight's character comes to realize and understand that if not for Rizzo, he wouldn't have a friend in the world. At times touching, at other times comical, one gets an insider's view of the seedy, sordid life of an outcast in the big city, and how a naive young newcomer can be taken in and taken out by hustlers far more experienced than themselves.Now even though Voight's performance is good, maybe even great, it's Dustin Hoffman who commands every scene he's in. I especially enjoyed the taxi-cab scene, in which Rizzo ad-libs his reaction after nearly being hit by a driver that disregarded the barriers put up to restrict traffic on the street for filming. Instead of losing their composure, both actors just went with it, making the scene a classic (and more than believable I might add).Interestingly, the picture holds up well today, even though other reviewers on this board feel it has a dated quality. I'll go with that if you're considering the coked out psychedelic party the duo wound up at, along with the inconceivable notion that you can get by in New York on ten or twenty dollars at a time. The film's brilliance lies in showing how two entirely disparate and flawed characters can find and relate to each other in a maelstrom of depravity, defying the odds to trust and rely on each other, and ultimately to become friends.",Midnight Cowboy
10,gavin6942,"Dustin Hoffman at His Finest... Jon Voight's Okay, Too",9,18 March 2010,"Joe Buck (Jon Voight) moves to New York because he has some weird belief that rich women there will sleep with him for money. This doesn't work so well, but he meets a hustler named Ricco Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) who takes him in and helps him learn the ways of the street. The two become friends and do what they can to survive.I enjoyed every minute of this film. The music, the characters, the presentation... it was all very well-crafted. I can't say I'm a huge Jon Voight fan, but here he did a fine job. And Dustin Hoffman did a supremely convincing job. Hoffman is always good, but this is one of his best roles, by far.I really appreciated the very mild gay subtext, if it existed at all. You can interpret it either way. The director is gay and in the book the characters are gay, but here they are presented as straight... more ""best buddies"" than gay lovers. I think that's probably how we should see them, but in light of the book it's hard to say for sure. (Roger Ebert calls this a ""love story"", so he's weighing in, too.) Ebert thinks the film's weakness is the psychedelic scenery, and I agree. I thought some of the flashbacks were a bit much, yet necessary, but the psychedelic parts were over the top and made this a sixties film rather than a timeless film that it might have been otherwise. I was less distracted by the scenes of 42nd Street and Tiffany's. I don't think I disapprove as strongly as Ebert, does, however, as I rate the film overall much higher than he does.",Midnight Cowboy
11,lee_eisenberg,I'm watchin' this! I'm watchin' this!,10,13 September 2005,"""Midnight Cowboy"" may have marked the culmination of the '60s. Loner cowboy Joe Buck (Jon Voight) leaves his Texas town for New York, where he meets the sickly Enrico ""Ratso"" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman). There turns out to be only one thing for Joe to do: become a male prostitute. Even if this is his only option in life, it works out for his and Ratso's relationship.Dustin Hoffman was clearly a great actor in ""The Graduate"", and ""Midnight Cowboy"" reaffirms that. You can practically feel Ratso on yourself. It's easy to see why this movie won Best Picture: it really was possibly the greatest movie released that year. Watching it nowadays, it seems pretty silly that they rated it X when it first came out. But the point is, you HAVE to see this movie. 10/10 stars.",Midnight Cowboy
12,jboothmillard,Midnight Cowboy,9,21 November 2011,"From Oscar and BAFTA winning, and Golden Globe nominated director John Schlesinger (Marathon Man, Pacific Heights) I was studying this film as one of my Film Studies course works, I think it was part of my Shocking Cinema studies, I didn't realise though that I hadn't seen the entire film, so I got my hands on it and watched it. Basically Joe Buck (BAFTA and Golden Globe (also nominated) winning, and Oscar nominated Jon Voight, Angelina Jolie's father) is the stud from a small town in Texas who quits his job as a dishwasher and heads for New York City, planning to use his ""talents"" to make a splash with wealthy high society women. He is haunted occasionally by his bad memory flashbacks involving sexual abuse, violence and abandonment, but he portrays a good enthusiasm for life, with a hopeful, joyous, kind and generous spirit, but he is naive to how life in the city works, making him an easy targets for conning. Getting conned by his partners, including New York dame Cass (Oscar nominated Sylvia Miles), he meets streetwise and sick crippled conman Enrico Salvatore 'Ratso' Rizzo (BAFTA winning, and Oscar and Golden Globe nominated Dustin Hoffman), who does originally rip him off, but as they get to know each other they become firm friends and Joe learns the way of the con artist. They live together in Ratso's shabby home, and he take's over the management of the stud's hustling operation, and they set about finding wealthy women to make a small fortune from, for both of them, including stealing male escort appointment details. Joe does manage to get the best of the women, and even some men, he spends time with, including socialite Shirley (Golden Globe nominated Brenda Vaccaro), he realises that Ratso is getting more dreadfully ill as time goes by, and he has to make some big decisions. Making enough money for them he decides that he and his friend should travel by bus to Florida, where they can get regular jobs, but in the end Joe has the tragedy of losing Ratso from his severe illness, he dies on the journey next to him, and Joe keeps his arms around his friend as they travel on. Also starring John McGiver as Mr. O'Daniel, George Eppersen as Ralph, Ruth White as Sally Buck, Jennifer Salt as Annie, Gilman Rankin as Woodsy Niles and T. Tom Marlow as Little Joe. Hoffman is fantastic as the cripple with the knowledge of conning, and Voight is also fantastic as the naive male prostitute who can be slow, both are matched brilliantly as pretty much opposites, and the direction by Schlesinger is well executed. I knew it was the first X (or 18) rated film to win the Oscar for Best Picture, and it is a well deserved award for being a great insight into the darker world of New York City, as the outsider is sucked into this alien world of cruelty and occasionally false opportunity, and it is different approach to the buddy movie, a must see drama. It won the Oscars for Best Picture for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, and it was nominated for Best Film Editing, it won the BAFTAs for Best Film, Best Film Editing and Best Screenplay, and it was nominated for the UN Award, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Drama and Best Screenplay. ""I'm walking here!"" was number 27 on 100 Years, 100 Quotes, Nilsson's ""Everybody's Talking'"" was number 22 on 100 Years, 100 Songs, and the film was number 36 on 100 Years, 100 Movies.

13,Woodyanders,Lost and lonely in New York City,9,5 December 2018,"Naïve Texas cowboy Joe Buck (a fine and engaging performance by Jon Voight) goes to New York City with the specific ambition of becoming a successful gigolo. Although Joe fails miserably at realizing this particular goal, he nonetheless meets scuzzy con artist Ratso (superbly played with considerable slimy charm by Dustin Hoffman), with whom he manages to form a deep bond with.Director John Schlesinger offers a vivid evocation of the seedier side of the Big Apple, sees the fragile wounded humanity in the down and out main characters despite the cruel and sordid urban cesspool they reside in, and astutely captures the freaky low-rent underbelly of American culture that's fascinating in its grimy despair. Waldo Salt's thoughtful script makes a poignant and significant statement about the basic human need for connection and companionship, with the occasionally strained, but heartfelt friendship between the needy protagonists registering as quite moving and unforgettable as well as coming complete with an substantial emotional arc for Joe Buck in which he becomes a wiser and more humane person at the shattering conclusion.Voight and Hoffman both do sterling work with their roles; they receive sturdy support from Sylvia Miles as proud aging hooker Cass, John McGiver as religious fanatic Mr. O'Daniel, Brenda Vaccaro as the sassy Shirley, Barnard Hughes as the pathetic and desperate Towny, Ruth White as Joe's doting grandmother Sally, and Jennifer Salt as town tramp Annie.

14,ccthemovieman-1,"The Name ""Ratso Rizzo"" About Sums Up The Sordidness Of This Story",3,25 January 2008,"For those who like depressing films with sleazy characters and a sordid storyline, this one is for you! From the bleak New York City atmosphere, which comes across as an extremely grim and almost hopeless place, to two diverse lead characters devoid of much sense of morality, this movie is a real downer. Why it won the Academy Award was because it was so shocking at that time that Hollywood, brand new its freedom to show anything it wanted with all moral codes abandoned, wanted to celebrate that fact. Filmmakers then were like an immature six-year-old with an unlimited expense account at the local candy store. So, Hollywood gave theater viewers (for probably the first time) a dose of rape, prostitution, homosexuality, child nudity, homeless existence and other such wonderful sights and sounds only its twisted brain would think is appealing....and then awarded its work. It also hoped, I'm sure, to shock mainstream audiences. Well, it succeeded on that level. Audiences were stunned at what they say and heard and the Academy, proud of itself for being able to display filth and make money at the same time, couldn't help but bestow honors upon this piece of gilded garbage.Forty years ago, as a very young man, I found this film fascinating, too. However, seeing it again in the 1990s left such a bad taste in my mouth I never watched to view it again. The acting was good, but so what? Acting is good in many films. Nobody ever said Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight couldn't act. Hoffman was particularly good in his younger days in playing wacked-out people. He was kind of like the Johnny Depp of his era, playing guys like ""Ratso Rizzo"" in this film and then going to be the ""Rain Man"" later on. Yes, ""Ratso"" is a character you'll never forget, and ""Joe Buck"" (Voight) is one you want to forget, but the story is so sordid, it overwhelms the fine acting.This movie isn't ""art,"" and it isn't worthy of its many awards; it only pushed the envelope big-time in 1969 and that's why it is so fondly remembered in the hearts of film people and critics. It's two hours of profanity and ultra-sleazy, religious cheap shots, glorifying weirdos (Andy Warhol even gets in the act - no surprise), and generally despicable people.I did like the catchy song, ""Everybody's Talking'"" that helped make Harry Nilsson famous, but even that was bogus because Fred Neil wrote the song and sang it better, before Nilsson did it....and few people have ever heard of Neil (which is their loss). And - as mentioned - the name ""Ratso Rizzo"" kind of stays with you!The film is a landmark, but in a negative sense, I fear: this marked it as ""official"" that Hollywood had gone down the toilet, and it has remained in the sewer ever since.",Midnight Cowboy

""I'm WALKIN' here, I'm WALKIN' here!"" While watching this story of two down-and-outers trying to survive like roaches in New York City, what occurred to me is that -- I hate to say it -- but they just don't make them like this anymore. It's a dignified, adult movie. The cinematic teratomas now marching across our screens resemble 2016's presidential campaigns, designed by geniuses for execution by idiots.Jon Voight is Joe Buck, the polite Texan and self-described stud who comes to New York with the idea of becoming a male gigolo. It doesn't work. Running out of money he takes up with Dustin Hoffman as Ratso Rizzo, a pneumococcal street rat who knows how to get by, by conning, thievery, and finding the niches in the rules against finding the niches.Some of the images are unforgettable -- a long shot of Voight, upright under his stylish cowboy hat, striding in his self-possessed way across a spare bridge in silhouette, with a stunted, crippled Richard III jerking and hobbling along behind him. And here is Voight, freshly arrived, spiffy in incandescent cowboy shirt, buckskin jacket, and shiny boots stopping to gawk at a well-dressed man sprawled out motionless on the sidewalk while the pedestrian traffic opens up and flows around the body.It's not a flawless picture but it should still be seen by everyone interested in movies, if only as a reminder that not every film needs to have someone's head being wrenched off or about the problems teens have in adjusting to high school, nor are ghoulish green shots required.

17,moonspinner55,Depressing squalor laced with sentiment,8,11 November 2001,"Fascinating downer about a would-be male hustler in New York City forced to live in a condemned building with a crippled con-man. Extremely bleak examination of modern-day moral and social decline, extremely well-directed by John Schlesinger (who never topped his work here) and superbly acted by Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman. Packs quite a punch overall, yet the ""fantasy"" scenes--played for a quick chuckle--are mildly intrusive, as is the ""mod"" drug party. The relationship that develops between the two men is sentimental, yet the filmmakers are careful not to get mushy, and this gives the picture an edge it might not have had with a lesser director than Schlesinger. Originally X-rated in 1969, and the winner of the Best Picture Oscar; screenwriter Waldo Salt (who adapted James Leo Herilhy's book) and Schlesinger also won statues. ***1/2 from ****",Midnight Cowboy
18,dbdumonteil,macadam cowboy,9,13 July 2006,"A young dishwasher from Texas, Joe Buck (Jon Voight) decides to climb the social ladder in New York where he thinks that thanks to his charm and his handsome appearance, he'll have no trouble seducing rich women. Alas! He comes up against disappointments and disillusions. As he becomes penniless, he's bent on prostituting himself to survive until he makes the acquaintance of a small Italian immigrant Ritso Razzo (Dustin Hoffman) who struggles to live through cons and tricks and lives in a hovel. A solid friendship brings the two men closer and Razzo confides to his new found friend his desire to leave for Florida and its warm climate. Times become distressing with the arrival of winter. Joe would have recourse to theft to pay the trip to the promised land...When ""Midnight Cowboy"" appeared on the American screens, it received a X certificate and was the first American film to pocket an Oscar with this certificate! It's easy to see what seduced the members of the jury to bestow this gem from John Schlesinger with actually three golden statuettes but today this X certificate seems quite pointless. There are strong sexual sequences but crowds have seen worse since.Anyway, ""Midnight Cowboy"" is along with ""Marathon Man"" (1976) Schlesinger's peak. The friendship he showed between this mismatched pair who are his two main characters is shot with reserve and sensibility. Joe Buck a good-looking, naive young man with a child's face who will gradually lose his innocence through his degeneration in the murky darkness of New York. Who else but Jon Voight could perform this pure character who wasn't prepared at all for a cruel world? A cruel world depicted in a hard-hitting way by the filmmaker. Ritso Razzo a tuberculous Italian immigrant who craves to get out of this hell to take refuge in Florida. Schlesinger's camera work is inventive to say the least and almost always adequate with the vibe one sequence could convey. With shrewd cinematographic methods he unveils us some parts of his two characters' persona like Joe's troubled childhood or Razzo's wild dreams in Florida. Their relationship is a sunbeam in a cloudy even ominous sky. Human dignity is preserved as much as possible.What else to add?

The film stars a young Jon Voight as a guy from the pig farms of Texas who moves to New York and becomes a man-whore.  While in town, he meets the memorable Ratzo Rizzo played even more memorably by Dustin Hoffman.  They then form a good yet sad friendship.  Stylishly compelling, with two fine performances at it's core, and even thought the X rated form might scare away some people, most sex scenes go fast with quick yet excellent editing.  A very well made film experience, however never watch this film on TV, and that goes for most films that have some explicit stuff.  A+",Midnight Cowboy

Too bad that they probably were able to cancel each other out. American icon, John Wayne, would have probably won anyway due to his long Hollywood history. Can anyone ever say that he was better than Voight or Hoffman?Voight's naivety is believable. He encounters Ratso, a conniving character. Both soon have the tables turned on them by Sylvia Miles, who plays the prostitute Cass, in a memorable brief but supporting performance. The frustration and contempt on her face tells her whole story.You want to cough with Ratso. His disgusting appearance, his motions, his entire demeanor made his performance even more outstanding. Ratso,you deserved that Oscar and not the Duke!""Midnight Cowboy"" has the distinction of being the only x-rated Oscar winning film in the history of the Academy Awards.An achievement of two losers who find each other and a hostile, uncaring environment about them.

22,Theo Robertson,Everyone's Talking About It Being a Great Movie,8,17 August 2005,"Despite this being a very good film it's also a very strange one . Joe Buck decides to travel to The Big Apple as a male escort . This sets up MIDNIGHT COWBOY as something of a comedy and much of the movie is very , very amusing as Joe finds himself out of his depth in the big bad city . Let's face it this guy is naive and pathetic as he pulls out his wallet and gives his clients money for a taxi . LOL . However there is a slight problem the way the movie constantly changes in mood . Towards the end of the movie Hoffman's character is the one the audience find themselves feeling sorry for , helped in no small part by Joe committing a needless act of violence . I wouldn't say this is a mistake on the part of screenwriter Waldo Salt but the scene in the hotel room made me lose any type of empathy I had left for Joe . we instantly like Joe and dislike Ratso and by the end of the movie our feelings for the pair are reversed ! Probably deliberate . As for the rest of Salt's screenplay I did feel that Joe's background story was rather unexplained ( Just who is that lover of Joe's and who are that gang ? ) but I guess it's up to the individual to work out what it was all about and the story is very well paced Director John Schlesinger won an Oscar for this movie back in the days when the Academy voters were more interested in giving awards for people who deserved it . Schlesinger makes good the use of music without drowning the audience in the score , a pity that later directors seem unable to get the balance right . It's also a beautifully edited movie as characters experience flashbacks and hopeful hallucinations , most memorable the sunshine by the Maimi pool that comes to a halt when Joe gets his face slapped and is ejected from a hotel . The acting can't be faulted either . Possibly the only real criticism about the directing is that the psychedelic party scene seems rather dated now Over all this is a very good film but in my opinion not a great one because of my eventual feelings for Joe which does spoil the movie ever so slightly . I should also point out that I read OF MICE AND MEN for my English exams as both a schoolboy and as a student , so much so that I ended up hating the novel and if MIDNIGHT COWBOY resembles any literary classic it's the aforementioned Stienbeck book .",Midnight Cowboy
23,Doylenf,Struggle for survival in the big city...brilliant performances...,8,28 August 2006,"Hardly the stuff dreams are made of is this pursuit of the brass ring by a naive hustler (JON VOIGT) and his lame con-man sidekick (DUSTIN Hoffman), soon to forge a friendship based on basic survival skills.A daring film for its time, and a foremost example of the kind of gritty landscape being explored in the more graphic films of the '60s. Symbolic of the ""end of innocence"" in American films, since it was the only X-rated film to win a Best Picture Oscar.JON VOIGT is the male hustler who comes to the big city expecting to find women an easy way to make money when they fight over his body, but soon finds the city is a cold place with no welcome mat for his ilk. Befriended by a lame con-man (DUSTIN Hoffman), he goes through a series of serio-comic adventures that leave him disillusioned and bitter, ready to leave the confines of a cold water flat for the sunshine promised in Florida, a land his friend ""Ratzo"" dreams of living in.But even in this final quest, the two are losers. John Schlesinger has directed with finesse from a brilliant script by Waldo Salt, and John Barry's haunting ""Midnight Cowboy"" theme adds to the poignant moments of search and desperation.Summing up: A true American classic honestly facing a tough subject and daring to show the underbelly of certain aspects of city life.",Midnight Cowboy
24,preppy-3,Depressing but excellent,10,3 March 2004,"Young, handsome, muscular Joe Buck (Jon Voight) moves from Texas to New York thinking he'll make a living by being a stud.  He gets there and finds out quickly that it isn't going to be easy--he goes through one degrading experience after another.  At the end of his rope he hooks up with crippled, sleazy Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman).  Together they try to survive and get out of the city and move to Florida.  But will they make it?Very dark, disturbing yet fascinating movie.  Director John Schelsinger paints a very grimy portrait of NYC and its inhabitants.  In that way it's dated--the city may have been this bad in 1969 but it's cleaned up considerably by now.  He also uses every camera trick in the book--color turning to black & white; trippy dream sequences; flash forwards; flash backs (especially involving a rape); shock cuts; weird sound effects...you name it.  It keeps you disoriented and off center--but I couldn't stop watching.There isn't much of a story--it basically centers on the friendship between Rizzo and Buck.  There is an implication that they may have been lovers (the final shot sort of shows that).  It's just a portrait of two damaged characters trying to survive in a cold, cruel, urban jungle.This was originally rated X in 1969--the only reason being that the MPAA didn't think that parents would want their children to see this. Nevertheless, it was a big hit with high schoolers (back then X meant no one under 17).  It also has been the only X rated film ever to win an Academy Award as Best Picture.  Hoffman and Voight were up for acting awards as was (mysteriously) Sylvia Miles who was in the picture for a total of (maybe) 5 minutes!  It was eventually lowered to an R (with no cuts) when it was reissued in 1980.Also the excellent song ""Everybody's Talkin'"" was introduced in this film--and became a big hit.A great film---but very dark.  I'm giving it a 10.  DON'T see it on commercial TV--it's cut to ribbons and incomprehensible.",Midnight Cowboy
25,LeonLouisRicci,The Odd Couple,9,16 December 2013,"The disturbing decay of a City and two unfortunates make this a not so pleasant Character Study that had a New Wave, Scintillating Style and Lead Performances that are nothing short of Brilliant. The images in the Movie are just as important as the People that are placed in them.Unforgettable Street Scenes and the eroding, yet sometimes beautifully decadent Landscape of New York, before the antiseptic Renaissance, make this a Time Capsule that proves to be quite the Postcard from Hell.There are a number of Artistic flourishes mostly used in Dream Sequences and Flashbacks, but also in a Drug induced Warhol type party. The best of which is the chase sequence where Joe Buck pursues Rico/Ratso in a furious rage through the bowels of the City.It is a stunning and a drain of a Movie. It saps the Viewers energy with some gut-wrenching realism, then energizes it with some Black Humor, Psychedlia, and Pathos, then saps it again with a more realistic display of Human Frailty. This constant back and forth as it is playful and painful, is at the Heart of the Experience that is Midnight Cowboy.",Midnight Cowboy

27,Boba_Fett1138,"""Midnight Cowboy"" shoots and hits.",8,4 January 2012,"Basically this movie is like a lot of other similar movies, made around the same period, that are being simplistic and very straightforward with its characters and story. The one thing that this movie still has extra going for it as well, is its originality with its story.This movie has the guts to tell a not so everyday story for a movie, especially not for its time. It's a story that involves male prostitutes, which also involves some homosexual aspects at times. But not that the movie ever gets raunchy or goes over-the-top or too far with anything. Despite all of its dramatic aspects about its story and characters, the movie manages to find a pleasant balance between its drama and entertainment. ""Midnight Cowboy"" gets never too heavy or falls into false sentiments. It makes the movie more powerful and effective than it would had been if it had gone for a more complete serious and straightforward approach.The movie so easily could had gone for shock value but instead it makes the choice to tell a more human story. And perhaps this still is the movie its greatest power; its characters. They are above all very realistic and therefore also easy to like and identify with, even while the characters are doing some not so everyday things.It's a movie that is deliberately kept simple and little. So don't expect big twists or characters doing some extreme stuff. But this is why the movie worked and why I liked its story. Nothing ever gets overdone and the movie is also far from a pretentious one.It's true that perhaps Dustin Hoffman never has been better, in any movie. He's actually quite unrecognizable in his role, since he is playing a character you normally would never expect him to play. Also quite unrecognizable is Jon Voight, in one of the earliest roles out of his career. Both actors also got nominated for an Oscar, both in the leading roles categories, which is something quite special. In my opinion it still is foremost Jon Voight who plays the leading role and also definitely has the most screen time. But both lost anyway but the movie still eventually won the three most important Oscar's, for its writing, directing and best picture of the year.A great and special movie within its genre.8/10 http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Midnight Cowboy
28,view_and_review,Uncomfortable to Watch,4,25 March 2019,"Midnight Cowboy was a lot stranger than I expected. First of all, it was weird seeing Jon Voight in such a role. To be honest it was weird to see a young Jon Voight period. The only Jon Voight I have ever known has been the elderly version.Secondly, the story and the imagery that accompanied it was off-putting.Jon Voight plays Joe Buck (not the arrogant sports announcer Joe Buck) who's a wannabe cowboy from Texas looking to be a hustler (read male prostitute) in New York. His lavish plans get derailed as he finds himself hustled particularly by Rico ""Ratzo"" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman). Eventually, the two of them strike up this very peculiar friendship that is more pimp/hooker that buddy/buddy.As Joe Buck makes his way through New York he has these flashes that are part flashback part imagination. These flashes are mostly lurid images that go totally unexplained. Rico, on the other hand, plays a dirty grimy Rainman (well that's who his voice constantly reminds me of). This queer couple oozed incompetence and ignorance. Really it was uncomfortable to watch. It was also uncomfortable to listen to. Between Voight's horrible Texas accent with his faux southern hospitality and Hoffman's nasally high pitched utterances I'd rather hear Fran Drescher and Roseanne Barr having a debate.",Midnight Cowboy
29,neil-476,"The good, the bad, and the ugly",8,14 April 2011,"Was there ever a film of two such extremes? John Schlesinger's film tells the story of Joe Buck (John Voight in an impressive debut), a good looking country hick who comes to the big city to make a living (so he thinks) as a gigolo. His experiences are all bad and he ends up living in utter squalor with ""Ratso"" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) a tubercular petty criminal who had initially conned him, but who turns out to be the only person who actually gives him anything (a place to live, and food), meagre though it is. Then, just as Joe makes his first successful assignation (and through that, an inroad into the life he hoped to lead) Ratso's poor health turns worse, and Joe has to choose whether to abandon him or not.This is not a cheerful film. The characters are mostly unpleasant (although, to be fair), both Joe and Ratso, initially portrayed as seedy, petty and generally fairly worthless, are shown to have qualities which redeem them somewhat. But the events portrayed are relentlessly squalid and depressing. Fair enough, this is a part of the world we live in, no less so now than it was in 1969.Against this, however, we have Joe Buck's character arc - this is a character who learns something about himself, and who finishes the film a very much better person than he was at the start. And we have Ratso - one of life's casualties, one who will take advantage of someone who appears to be higher up the food chain than himself, but someone who will extend such generosity as is available to him when he sees that the same person is actually less equipped than he is to deal with city life.All the performances here are excellent, but Voight and Hoffman are both superb. You won't finish watching with a smile on your face (although you may have a tear in your eye), but you will be aware that you have been watching two great performances.And John Barry's music is quite special, too, with the Florida Fantasy sequence standing out for all sorts of reasons.",Midnight Cowboy
30,evanston_dad,"Ride 'Em, Cowboy",8,20 February 2007,"Oy vay. ""Midnight Cowboy"" is a serious contender in my book for most depressing film ever made.Every once in a while, there's a film that makes me wish I could go back and experience it the way audiences at the time of its release experienced it, and this movie is one of them. I'd venture to guess that American mainstream audiences had seen nothing quite like this at the time, and even now, though there have been hundreds of films since that are more violent, more realistic, more daring in subject matter, it's hard to shake off the grimy grittiness of this sad, sad story.Jon Voight of course plays Joe Buck, young Texan stud who dreams of going to the Big Apple and making his fortune as a hustler to beautiful, rich women. Voight walks a tight rope playing this pathetic and self-delusional character, and gives a tremendous performance. He quickly realizes that the cowboy routine is looked on as a joke in NYC, that he's nowhere near tough enough to make it in this hell-hole of a city, and that it's not beautiful rich women who are likely to pay for his services. He befriends the sickly Ratso Rizzo, played iconically by Dustin Hoffman, and the two of them strike up the kind of friendship that can only develop between two people who are such lonely losers that no one else will have them.This movie isn't remotely entertaining. It's relentlessly grim, depicting a version of New York City that looks nothing like the city today, filled with degenerates and dregs, sleazy sex, drugs and perverts. Director John Schlesinger can't control himself and uses all manner of trendy 60s cinematic devices, including crazy zooms, shock editing, abrupt changes from color to black and white, sped up action. All of this likely seemed cutting edge at the time, and enhanced the feeling for audiences that they were seeing something unique, but now it all makes the film look terribly dated, much more so than other films released at the same time.But it's worth sitting through, because of its marvelous acting, and its rich thematic structure. Schlesinger addresses a lot of issues in this film: the idea of masculinity; the different kinds of love possible between two men; the barriers between country and city; urban loneliness and isolation. In its own way, ""Midnight Cowboy"" even contributes its own voice to the ""death of the western hero"" theme that was so prevalent in other films from 1969, like ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" and ""The Wild Bunch."" Joe Buck, a cowboy modeled on the masculine ideals he picks up at drive-in movies, finds that what works in the world of myth doesn't work in the cruel, harsh realities of America's urban jungles.Some feminine sensibilities are provided by Sylvia Miles, in a brief but memorable appearance as Joe Buck's first conquest, a strung out society lady who hustles the hustler; and Brenda Vacarro, as a party-going druggie, who makes Joe go limp (if you know what I mean). A very young Bob Balaban also appears as a creepy young man who picks Joe up at a movie theatre and orally services him during the show. I wonder how he's billed in the closing cast credits.A must-see for anyone seriously interested in film history, but you're forgiven if you only want to see it once.Grade: A",Midnight Cowboy

36,StevePulaski,"""Only the echos of my mind""",8,21 November 2014,"I believe you can tell how a person views film and minimalism to a certain degree by asking them what they thought of John Schlesinger's Midnight Cowboy. If they say they thought it was a good film about two lost souls, they only understand about half the film. If they say the film is sad or depressing, then they have effectively realized the ideas and themes in the film. Midnight Cowboy is one of the saddest films I've ever seen, which is a remarkable feat given that the film has no real sad event. The idea of a life unlived, an unwelcoming world, and people that were destined to live their lives without a true sense of belonging, encouragement, or home are communicated so effectively in the film that at times I felt my heart sink and take a moment to regain composure. Midnight Cowboy isn't a perfect film, as its loose structure can sometimes get the best of it and, as a result, the film can descend into scenes that don't always fit particularly well together, but it's the themes handled so expertly in the film that make me regard it with such a fondness. The film stars Jon Voight as Joe Buck, who we see in the opening credits of the film - set to the brilliantly fitting theme of the film ""Everybody's Talking'"" by Harry Nilsson - a dishwasher at a diner who decides to throw on a cowboy suit and head for New York City in hopes of working as a male prostitute for women. Right off the bat, it's a sad state of affairs if packing up, leaving everything you've known behind, and setting course for the big city with ambitions of being a prostitute is one's immediate goal, but I digress. Soon after he arrives in New York City, he meets Enrico Salvatore ""Ratso"" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), a petty con man with bad health and a limp, who initially takes money from Joe with promises of introducing him to a pimp who is in fact a Christian. Despite this deliberately insincere encounter, Joe and Ratso soon strike a business relationship of hustling New York locals in exchange for lofty cash returns.The film watches these characters take on a relationship I can only relate to that of George and Lenny in John Steinbeck's classic novel Of Mice and Men. Much like in that work, the two characters are, what we quietly assume, doomed from the start and the remaining pages of the book or minutes of the film is just a reiteration of their shattered sense of belonging. Voight and Hoffman are so good here that they essentially become the film, as we get the sense that writer Waldo Salt had additional plans for these characters in the vein of more situational occurrences, but the performances of the actors and the hopelessness of their characters bleeds through any hope of an event-driven plot. The only issue I take with Midnight Cowboy is that Salt never seemed to recognize this, and thus, never allowed as many thought-provoking or telling conversations about Joe and Ratso to take place. He never seemed to grasp the idea that Midnight Cowboy plays more like a character piece than anything, and while simultaneously leaving the characters vague enough for connection and not adapting a plot out of a plethora of situations, made a film caught somewhere in the middle of its agenda. Midnight Cowboy, as much as I want to center it and just rave about the greatness of its two leading males, is not a fully-realized film.Yet, Schlesinger and Salt give Voight and Hoffman enough free range to make them shine, and as a result, the film wound up working out for most involved. Voight became a household name after his performance, Hoffman became known for more than just The Graduate and became a name of equal importance, both earned a Best Actor nomination, Salt was granted the Best Adapted Screenplay Oscar, Schlesinger the Best Director, and the film Best Picture. While Midnight Cowboy seems to have a bit of a narrative identity crisis, it's nonetheless a display of two fine performances, a non- judgmental relationship between two hopeless characters, and a breakthrough for urban cinema, showing one of the most romanticized American cities as a place where untold ugliness can and does exist.Starring: Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman.

Not to mention, I am a huge fan of Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight, both are incredibly talented actors, and unfortunately not too many actors have been able to compare to them now-a-days. But for me the film just didn't work, it was just incredibly dated, you can tell by the film making, and the story just was too depressing. Although, I have to admit, I still got a few kicks out of the movie, especially now that I know where that line came from ""Hey! I'm walking here!"". Dustin rocks!Basically, Jon Voight plays Buck, a cowboy who has moved to New York to be a prostitute to makes ends meat, but he ends up meeting Enrico, played by Hoffman, a crippled con artist. They buddy up together to make it and have dreams, or at least more so by Enrico, to move to Florida/paradise. But things take a horrible turn when Enrico comes down with a bad fever, it really puts their friendship to the test.The first X-Rated (by the way what's up with that rating?) film to be voted Best Picture, it really was interesting to watch, and I don't regret seeing it, just I felt that it was kind of dated and could have been done a little better.

Yet it counters with a learning and growing experience, that's supported well with flashback and foreshadowing.",8,19 July 2009,"1969's best picture winner ""Midnight Cowboy"" clearly is one of the better films ever made as at it's time was controversial due to it's many nude scenes. As now those scenes are mostly overlooked, still this film presents a journey that still holds up and last the test of time. ""Midnight Cowboy"" is blended well with humor, drama, and sadness which all of those themes wraps around perfect to showcase it's main message of that is life is a learning experience and it's possible on a journey even when different cultures clash. The acting is top notch as the chemistry between the two leads Hoffman and Voight is just perfect, all of those elements made this a classic picture to remember and cherish.Enter and meet Joe Buck(played great by Jon Voight)who's a small town country boy in Texas. Joe has his sights set on bigger and better things he wants to go to the northeast and the big apple of New York city. He wants to escape the howdies and sheltered ways of small town Texas, as his plans are to earn money by clever means and he also wants to romance and bed attractive and elegant women. After riding the bus and arriving he conquers some prey yet soon Joe finds still the big city had plenty of strange people and uncertainty. As it's an eye opener for this Texan as he sees the dirty streets and easy come and easy go women plus Joe even encounters the wild side by seeing homosexuals. Yet his most important friendship is meeting Ratso Rizzo(executed comically and to form by Dustin Hoffman)this man is a on your edge con man who makes his living from schemes and bribes. Still Rizzo lives on the edge of society, yet he takes the tall Texan under his wing as both learn a lot about life, living, and counter culture as their different personalities clash while learning each other. Thru it all the journey and goal is to bus away to sunny Miami, Florida as that goal is reached it doesn't happen though without sadness occurring.Overall great film one of the 60's best it showcased that life is a journey and it proves that unexpected friendship can happen even if it involves the clashing of two different cultures. Though many might find the con man and scheming ways of living along with the sex scenes a turnoff to this film, still it's story is great as the chemistry between the two leads make it enjoyable and it blends well with humor and life experience which lead to a tragic end making it more memorable.",Midnight Cowboy
39,MovieAddict2016,Much better than expected,10,5 December 2004,"I sat down to watch ""Midnight Cowboy"" thinking it would be another overrated '60s/'70s movie. Some of my favorite films come from the '70s, in the same vein as ""Midnight Cowboy"" (""Taxi Driver,"" ""Mean Streets,"" ""Panic in Needle Park,"" etc.) but there are many, many overrated ones as well that have gained strong reputations amongst critics for being groundbreaking - unfortunately a vast majority of them don't hold up as well today. I sort of feel this way about ""Easy Rider."" (Although it, too, is one of my favorites.)So, I didn't expect much from ""Midnight Cowboy"" but got a lot back. It's a touching story, well-made and well-told with some of the best performances of all time. Dustin Hoffman, as Enrico ""Ratso"" Rizzo, gives one of his best - it's a bit funny at times (he sounds like a cartoon character when he speaks - maybe because of the Lenny/""Simpsons"" connection), but Hoffman is entirely convincing. Half of the film's budget went towards his paycheck as he was just becoming a major star in Hollywood. Opposite him is the second-billed Jon Voight as Joe Buck, the ""cowboy"" who travels North to the Big Apple in the hopes of becoming a male prostitute. Soon his naive ways land him in trouble and he pairs up with a crippled scam artist named ""Ratso"" - who offers to become Joe's ""manager"" for a certain percentage of profits.The movie is quite long at two hours but never really seems very long. Some films can tend to drag, especially some of the films that were made in the '70s because (as it's been said in ""Easy Riders, Raging Bulls"") the directors were the stars of the movies in the 1970s and occasionally they got a bit too infatuated with their material, going on too long examining characters/scenes/etc. that aren't important. Just about the only scene I felt was a bit too long and unnecessary was the drug party - it makes the film seem extremely outdated (similar to the drug odysseys in ""Easy Rider"") and really harms its flow because it's not needed.Other than that, ""Midnight Cowboy"" is an almost flawless motion picture. I was pleasantly surprised. It does have its flaws (flashbacks are a bit tacky and never used as well as they could have been, for instance) and some of the scenes are a bit uneasy (such as the gay movie theater sequence) but if you can handle its content ""Midnight Cowboy"" is a truly great motion picture, an uncompromising examination of life on the streets in the late '60s/early '70s. It's a depressing movie, yes, and by today's standards might seem a bit outdated and heavy on the liberal perspective of ""life is horrible, etc.""...but I still love it and particularly the extremely touching ending will stay with me for a long, long time.Highly recommended. One of the best films of the '70s. (It was technically released in late 1969 but I'd still categorize it as a 1970s film. It also won the Best Picture Oscar, being the first - and only - X-rated motion picture to do so. It was later re-rated R on appeal.)4.5/5",Midnight Cowboy

Otherwise, this unsavory picture would only succeed in dragging their undermined integrity straight down through a gutter of cinematic slime.Anyway - I won't even begin to tell you how much I despise actor, Dustin Hoffman.

42,sol-kay,We'll just drive on in. There's nothing else we can do now.,7,24 April 2012,"***SPOILERS*** Depressing and squalid movie about the underbelly of big city life or better yet existence involving transplanted Texan Big, in more ways then one, Joe Buck, Jon Voight, who thinks that he's God's gift to women only to find out that what he's got to give them-Good O'l fashion country style lovin-isn't exactly what their interested in; Especially if they have to pay for it.Joe arriving after a five day bus ride in the ""Big Apple"", New York City, is all set to set the town on fire in becoming a full time gigolo or hustler thinking that the women, the rich one's that is, in town will flock to him for is services. It doesn't take long for Joe to figure out that he's been deluding himself with his home grown fantasies about his sexual prowess when the first hit he makes with big time upscale city hooker Cass, Sylvia Miles, turns into to disaster for him. To Joe's shock it's Cass who demands cash for her services not the other way around!From then on Joe's dreams of becoming a big time and high paid hustler in the big city becomes more and more of a pipe dream for him and those of us watching the movie. It's when Joe runs into petty street hustler the gimpy Ratso Ricco Rizzo, Dustin Hoffman, that his life in the city truly becomes an urban nightmare. After being stiffed out of his last dollar in an arrangement with a gay religious nut, John McGiver, by Ratso Joe, after tracking him down, later ends up working for him with Ratso, as his manager, pimping him out to mostly men not woman clients. The always coughing and hard of breathing Ratso for his part knows that he doesn't have long to live at least in the cold and unfriendly surroundings of NYC and desperately wants to travel by bus to sunny Miami Florida, the land of sunshine & coconut milk, and live out his last days there.It's later after getting his naive country boy hustler act all together is when Joe finally realizes his dream of being a man in demand for rich women after a midnight fling with kinky socialite Shirly,Brenda Vaccaro. It's Shirly whom he met at a freaked out Greenwich village drug party when Ratso's medical condition, in having trouble breathing, turns for the worse. It's now up to Joe to save his friend's life by getting him,together with himself, on a bus to Miami before his heart gives out. The problem is where can he get the cash,some $50.00, to buy the bus tickets! Sleazy but interesting film that by the time it's finally over you do get to somehow force yourself to like both Joe & Ratso despite the low lives that they are. It's later that the two, or Ratso at least, gets what's coming to them for all the petty as well as serious crimes that they committed in the movie! One of which in the case of Joe Buck is the brutal and savage beating by him of out of town and helpless gay businessman Towny, Barnard Hughes, which could have possibly resulted in him being murdered! P.S Being rated X at the time of its release back in the spring of 1969 must have given ""Midnight Cowboy"" that extra boost it needed in it's winning the Academy Award as best picture, the first and only X-rated movie to win it, the following year. That's in it being considered hip cool and ahead of it's time back then in the minds of many of those members of the Academy who voted for it and probably didn't want to miss out on their big chance of making movie history which in fact they did. Watching the movie ""Midnight Cowboy"" today you come to realize that not only isn't it all that great to begin with having a dumb and dumber, Ratso & Joe, cast of characters as well as a number of mindless and confusing flashbacks only put in to pad it's running time of almost two hours. And as for its X-rating that in it being released by a major Hollywood studio, with top actors staring in it, which made it so popular at the time the film's ""shocking"" soft core sex scenes could barley pass for a R rating with today's movie going public!",Midnight Cowboy
43,ElMaruecan82,Why 1969 was a revolutionary year ...,10,18 August 2011,"'Everybody's talking at me, I don't hear a word they're sayin', only the echoes of my mind ' well, hearing these beautiful words echoed something very deep in mine. A few movies have been gifted with a song that captures their spirit to the point we can't tell which one defines the other, elevating themselves to mirror more universal feelings. ""Midnight Cowboy"", Best Picture winner of 1969 is one of them.Harry Nillson's poetry responds to the torment of a society in both urban and mental metamorphosis, torn between the past's heritage and the future's uncertainty, between America's deepest roots : God, Family, Community, Progress and an exhilarating fresh air of revolt and anti-establishment. In 1969, post-industrial societies were divided into a simplistic but no less significant dichotomy : the Old and the New order, everything was defined by its ability to move on, or to stay. The movie is about a man who's definitely moving, quitting a lousy job of dishwasher in a Texan diner to go to New York City, some sort of reversal conquest of the West. Joe Buck is his name. Joe has every reason to be self-confident, he's tall, strong, young, healthy, blonde, ""not a real cowboy, but one hell of a stud"" is his motto. New York resonates in his inexperienced mind like 'New World'. The opening farewell to the hometown conveys an inspirational freedom of spirit and movements, incarnated by Joe's smile and constantly positive attitude. He can have all the chicks, but he's more interested in old and rich ladies for hustling is the job he wants to do and for something unconsciously attracts him to older ladies. Maybe deep in his heart, Joe is still a little child in quest of a strong motherly figure; this sweet and innate innocence is even highlighted when he plays peek-a-boo with a little girl, in the bus leading to New York. Joe realizes the gap between the world he wants to penetrate and his true nature, and this is the source of his discomfort.""Midnight Cowboy"" is punctuated with regular fast-paced flashbacks developing Joe's background story. Joe was raised by his grand-mother Sally in an overly loving intimacy and one obscure episode involves a disturbing event that has probably perverted his approach to sex. He's moving but something keeps him connected to a nostalgic vision of childhood. From Joe's point of view, nothing is wrong in his business, he's only taking his share of the American Dream with what is at hands. But from our perspective, he's simply lost, the repeated first line ""Where's that Joe Buck?"" taking its full meaning.Jon Voight performance's perfectly embodies the excess of an idealism so childish it flirts with naivety and can only foreshadow great deceptions. After a few days in the racket, Joe loses more than he wins money, the height of irony is reached when he even gives one client 20$ after she burst out to tears, feeling insulted after Joe asked for money. Victim of his good nature again, Joe will be disillusioned by a small-time punk, named Rico Rizzo aka 'Ratso'. For 20$, Joe is sent to a supposedly future manager, who'll reveal himself to be a pervert zealot asking Joe to get on his knees ... so they can pray the Lord. Besides the flashbacks, the editing excels in tracing some interestingly subversive parallels. In one audacious scene for example : frenetic movements in bed activate TV channels with a remote control and a succession of pointless programs and manipulative ads, shows on screen.TV appears like the Pandora box hiding the sad realities of the consumer society. Sex is part of this degeneracy where sacred values, religion and family, have been totally corrupted. And from the ambiguity of the ""on your knees"" line, resurrects Joe's traumatic experience when he was baptized. The movie depicts religion, in an incredibly revolutionary boldness, as a rape soul. Everything is abuse, consumption from the ultra-realistic, bold, and psychedelically dizzying direction of John Schelsinger, winner of the best Director Oscar. A spiritless society where money, urbanism, sex and bigotry mix in a repulsive nocturnal orgy, creating more frustration, loneliness and perversity, from a mother running a fake mouse around hers son's face to some old broads killing their loneliness by treating their dogs like human beings. For Joe who has no religion and no money, the salvation will come from the most precious thing that could have enriched his life : a friendship.And this is where ""Midnight Cowboy"" emerges from the dirt and becomes one of the most classic and poignant friendship stories, between two men whose backs are put in the wall by a cynical society. The image in the poster shows them as misfits, but look at them closely and see how they complete each other, one has the looks, the youth, the health, and the strength, but is like a child, the other is street-wise, knows the ropes, he's crippled, unhealthy, and cruelly lacks in appearance but he's got pride. The iconic ""I'm walkin' here"" speaks to many lonely people rejected by society. Dustin Hoffman, in a 180 degree turn from his previous role as ""The Graduate"", demonstrates here his incredible versatility. The friendship between Razzo and Joe will strengthen them, in their daily struggles, to overcome the most nightmarish aspects of New York City, an alienating town whose depressing mood is incarnated by John Barry's iconic harmonica sound.Joe and Razzo ultimately appear as the only persons we can identify with, victims of a ultra-individualistic urban world they don't belong to. In reaction, all they have is to dream of running on the beach, having fun together, in other words, applying the magic of Harry Nillson's song and 'going where the sun keeps shining' Whether they'll succeed or not is not relevant, but no matter how hard they're freezing their asses in New York, sun keeps shining in their hearts ...",Midnight Cowboy
44,MOscarbradley,It gets better with every passing year,10,3 August 2007,"""Midnight Cowboy"" was never a great movie to start with but it is a classic. You know it's a classic the moment its insistent theme song, 'Everybody's Talking' starts up on the soundtrack, (actually not written for the film), and the way the camera introduces us to Joe Buck, (naked and in the shower). We had seen Jon Voight before but had never really noticed him but when he tells us he's 'one helluva stud' who's to doubt him? This was a great performance that had iconic star status as well as a complete grasp of the character and if Voight had never done anything else, his performance here would still be legendary. As it is Voight has seldom disappointed on screen; even a piece of ham as well cured as his performance in that glorious rubbish ""Anaconda"" is a source of pleasure).The film became famous and infamous almost overnight. It was a crowd-pleaser, (even with its downbeat ending), funny and sexy and recognizably 'real'; (it was the tail-end of the sixties and all the characters rang true). It was also the first 'X' rated film to win the Oscar as the year's Best Picture. Adapted, (brilliantly), by Waldo Salt from a James Leo Herlihy novel it was probably the first main-stream commercial American movie to deal with 'taboo' subjects such as homosexuality and drug-taking in a matter-of-fact manner. Everyone is recognizably human, warts and all, and everyone is treated sympathetically. Voight's Joe Buck is an innocent abroad, a Candide who comes to New York to seek his fortune as a hustler, (a profession he sees as glamorous and not seedy; he's a cross between a gigolo and a social worker). But when he himself is hustled by a scraggy, wormy little con-man called 'Ratso' Rizzo, (Dustin Hoffman, fresh from ""The Graduate"" and he's a revelation), he realizes that perhaps the reality is a little different from the pipe-dream.Essentially it's a male love story, (though totally platonic), between these two not so unlikely bedfellows. Both totally alone, both totally needy each becomes the protector of the other, (Voight with his physical prowess, Hoffman with his street-wise savvy). They are misfits adrift from the mainstream, tolerant of their own peculiarities and the deviances of others. Though 'straight' Voight isn't beyond a homosexual encounter in a 42nd street cinema with a boy even lonelier than himself. (The whole film posits a strangely 'Christian' attitude).It's also magnificently acted. While Voight and Hoffman hold the screen throughout there are superb vignettes from the likes of Brenda Vaccaro and Sylvia Miles as well as John McGiver, Bob Balaban and Bernard Hughes as sundry customers and hangers-on, beautifully delineated little character studies that seem to transcend acting altogether while John Schlesinger's direction gives the film the feel of a documentary as well as an alien's totally detached eye-view of the American under-belly without rancor and without criticism. On second thoughts, maybe it is a great movie after all.",Midnight Cowboy
45,dromasca,time travel,9,23 June 2019,"Cinematographic anniversaries are trendy. Films made 40, 45 or 50 years ago celebrate their birthdays with digital versions of the original films, sometimes even recovering scenes forgotten on assembly or removed by censorship or self-censorship. It is a great opportunity for me to see for the first time some of the important creations of the cinema of the world at that time, films that were unlikely to be brought on the screens of Communist Romania where I was living in the 1960s or 1970s. In many cases, these are real revelations, a good example being 'Midnight Cowboy', directed by John Schlesinger. The film, recovered under excellent technical conditions, is extremely fresh and at the same time authentic, giving viewers a time travel opportunity in the 1960s America, with music and landscapes of the period, with its people and their sins.The story in the film is very contemporary, and I think that a remake (which I hope will not be done) should not change too much from the scenario. The two main heroes live on the edge of the Big Apple society, trying to make a living in the masculine version of the oldest profession in the world supplemented by a semi-homeless life and small robberies. The mirage of the great city quickly turns into a struggle for survival, in which the strange friendship between two strange people is a lifeline that helps them survive, even for a while. The social radiography and the psychological characterization are exceptional. These were the years in which American cinema, including that of big studios, was shifting from the self-censorship based on moral patterns to a more modern and realistic approach to the America of contrasts. This film is rightfully considered a landmark in this evolution.I could write an essay on the interpretation of the two actors, Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman, and it would be deserved. For Voight , the role of Texas cowboy Joe Buck who came to conquer New York and is hiding terrible traumas behind his innocent smile was his first important role, the one that launched his career. Hoffman was coming after the success of 'The Graduate' and the role of the cynical crook 'Ratso' not only consolidated his career but also helped him avoid stereotypes of distribution. This was his first or greatest composition role, others were to follow. Can I say these are two interpretations of anthology? I said it. And there are many other reasons to see 'Midnight Cowboy', one of the most contemporary movies I've seen lately, although it was done 50 years ago.",Midnight Cowboy
46,g-bodyl,Everlasting Friendship!,9,4 October 2015,"Midnight Cowboy is a very good movie, to say the least. I wasn't sure what to expect because of that controversial X-rating. But I was hearing this is one of the better influential films of the twentieth century, so I thought it was my duty to check it out. Now the film is about a close friendship that forged between two borderline criminals. How they go through life may not be endearing, but the friendship that is forged between them is very striking and moving. By the film's end, I have come to feel for the characters. The film does have a distinct overtone involving homosexuality, which is incredibly rare for a film in the 1960's. I think that is part of the controversy this film received. That being said, this is a fine work of art that stands to keep its hold in most influential films list.John Schlesinger's film is about a Texas hustler named Joe Buck who decides to move east to explore opportunities involving money and women. But he quickly realizes that New York City is nothing like his Texas hometown. He meets this outcast named Ratso who decides to show him how to strike it rich in the Big Apple. As the adventures start sailing, an everlasting friendship is forged between the two men.Now one thing that makes the film work the way it did was the outstanding performances. Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight have incredible chemistry with each other. Hoffman was coming off his role that fueled him to stardom in the Graduate and Voight just began what is the start of an incredible movie career. I really liked the makeup of the two characters. Voight, who is oblivious to the culture of the East with his cowboy attire in full swing while in the streets of NYC, and Hoffman who actually fits the name Ratso as I felt he resembled something of a human rat.Overall, Midnight Cowboy is a fantastic movie. A movie about friendship. It was a heart-warming experience for me. The ending of the movie was very proper, if a tad emotional. I can see why people rave about this movie. Now this may not end up as my all-time favorite movie, but I'd certainly put it in my top 50 films. There are a few small flaws, but nothing that hurts the film in all. If you have doubts about Hoffman and Voight as great actors, just watch Midnight Cowboy.My Grade: A",Midnight Cowboy

In a year that featured classic films such as Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, True Grit and Once Upon a Time in the West, why would the Academy give this movie the award for Best Picture?

48,secondtake,"Moving, funny, sad, unaffected, astonishing...",9,29 August 2012,"Midnight Cowboy (1969)This is such a gritty, touching story of two ordinary vulnerable young men, told with such honesty, it's impossible to criticize it taken whole. ""Midnight Cowboy"" is a terrific movie. It's terrific because of the two actors--an astonishing Dustin Hoffman, still a new name in Hollywood but already famous from ""The Graduate"" in 1967. And an equally astonishing Jon Voight, making his first large role in a movie. Each is a type of struggling man living on the fringe of New York (barely surviving in a boarded up building), extreme but never a caricature. They gel as a pair, helping each other but with a bit of reluctance because neither wants to quite admit they need help.It's terrific further because of the filming, with lots of available light magic in dingy places. The cinematographer, Adam Holender, is remarkably making his first film here, though that might explain the freshness to a lot of the filming. There is in particular a lot of long lens (telephoto) shooting between more intimate scenes, showing layers of people and isolating the star in a moving world (a difficult thing to do with good focus). It's also terrific for the writing, not just for the story but for the dialog. It strikes so subtly to some truth you don't quite expect, even though it's simple and almost obvious. The screenplay won an Oscar, as did the movie (Best Picture) and director John Schlessinger (Best Director). It's worth noting that Schlessinger is a British director with some very tightly conceived movies already under his belt (including the fabulous ""Darling""), and here he seems to make New York as familiar as if he'd grown up here. Along those lines, Voight, playing the naive cowboy to a perfect pitch, is a native New Yorker. And Hoffman, though familiar with the city, is an L.A. kid.Where does the movie run into trouble? Why isn't it in the top ten of all time? I think it might boil down to three kinds of inserts into flawless the main narrative. The first is a series of flashbacks that in various ways try to ""explain"" or fill in the psychological background of Voight's character. As if it needs explaining. Or if it does benefit us all to know how he got to his beautiful troubled state, maybe there is something shocking and sensational about the inserts, as effective as they are on their own nightmarish terms.A second ""insert"" is a series of short sunny daydreams Hoffman's character has envisioning life in Florida in the sun. It's comic relief, and it mostly works, but there are cracks there. Finally there is a section of the actual narrative where the two men go to a party they've been invited to for spurious reasons (weird luck, mostly). It's too obviously an excuse to film a scene in a drug-addled Warhol-esque party. The hosts are effete artist types who want to film some strange New Yorkers out of context, and so we see the film film these filmmakers and so on. A great scene, but weirdly out of place.But all of his is to be taken in stride as the meat of the story kicks back in each time. And here, with a melancholy soundtrack, you will be moved and entranced. Amazing stuff. Brave and a lesson in how a film can be adventurous and heartfelt and not painfully slick, all at once. And succeed artistically and commercially.",Midnight Cowboy

I liked the fact I found out the song ""Everybody's Talking'"" by Nilsson was a soundtrack for this! Christ, I remember hearing that song when i was young and not thinking that it was for this movie. Such a class tune it is! I thought Jon Voight as the hustler looked pretty classy with his cowboy outfit. No wonder all the men and women cast were wanting to be on top of him haha! He was really good looking as a young man I have to say, no wonder Angelina Jolie always looked beautiful because of his looks haha! Seriously, they are both father and daughter legends!The only one bit I badly wanted was himself and Dustin Hoffman's characters kissed. I know I'm always a romantic but honestly, their friendship blossomed throughout the movie like I didn't understand why they didn't have a little smooch hahaha. I don't think Dustin Hoffman would be that impressed now lol! I really liked Hoffman's character as a typical new york outcast, the accent and his attitude was bang on!

The homosexual relationship of the main characters is not explicitly portrayed anywhere, but only strongly implied, although the director originally wanted to include a sex scene. But whether it is seen as a homosexual love or as a ""buddy"" movie, the story is equally striking and tragic. Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight did great in their roles and the chemistry between them is strong, and John Schlesinger faithfully preserved the taste of 42nd Street in the late sixties. The film was nominated for seven Academy Awards (both Hoffman and Voight were nominated for the Best Actor in a Leading Role) and won them for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium. It also earned a handful of other awards and nominations, it is included in the American Film Institute's list of the ""Top 100 Greatest American Movies"", most lists of the best and most controversial movies of all time, as well as Steven Schneider's ""1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die.""

The film looks very much like a product of its times, the late 1960s, including a psychedelic party scene. What must have seemed cutting edge at the time now appears tame and hackneyed. The usage of flashbacks, where a woman inexplicably keeps repeating a sentence, is vague and adds little to the narrative.

53,johnnyboyz,"Where one man thinks his dreams lie, another has already been at the forefront of the nightmare; as a grim and unabashed character study of people seeking escape plays out.",7,19 August 2010,"Midnight Cowboy covers a character, a young Texan named Joe Buck, as he heads on out to New York City and the consequent arrival there as he ventures in search of girls; fame; life and fortune, but generally girls. What he ends up discovering, and what the film curiously comes to form in its detailing, is a relationship with another male he meets in New York native Enrico Rizzo, an equally young but dirtier, scummier and more criminally minded man. It is through Enrico that he is able to discover most about what it means to have aspirations and dreams in heading on out to a place like New York City from somewhere like Texas. In a film about a young man initially trying to hook up with as many girls as possible, it is interesting how Midnight Cowboy manifests into this burning and intriguing drama about two men. As the film transcends, so too do Buck's feelings; and we feel they do as we watch the fact that it is a male that further's the most development out of our protagonist.The film is a wonderfully directed piece from John Schlesinger, someone whom would go onto make another film set in New York about a relatively fresh faced youngster forced into coming to terms with some harsh realities that lurk in and around his place of dwelling, in 1976's Marathon Man. Here, he creates an affecting coming of age piece-come-fish out of water story about a guy from simplistic enough roots heading on out to the big time but hitting head on what it is to really live when you're starting from ground zero with the hope of heading up. It is Jon Voight playing Joe, a man who packs in his menial job at the local Texan diner so as to catch the bus on out of there; he sings in the shower, excitedly; a clever montage of him getting dressed afterwards suggests a degree of perfectionism to his actions as he goes out of his way to make this particular dressing a good one. Once at the diner to say his goodbyes, he's seen to profoundly stand out amidst the drab, white clothing of the workers occupying the space with him. Yes sir, this fella is going places.From there, it's New York City or bust as the bus rolls east; the radio plays interviews with women describing their perfect man and Buck struggles to contain his excitement: NYC cannot come soon enough. Back home, a relationship with a girl ended in a lot more than just tears and the befuddled relationship with his only family member in his grandmother has its own tale to tell; but surely it's all good from here on in. We don't initially side with Joe, it becomes apparent the women are less than easily impressionable with certain failings to woo some women greeted with soft music suggesting a mite of pity is in order. Other times see him score, but mix ups in payment and a failed attempt at becoming a male prostitute add to a growing sense of swift disillusionment with the attitude. Where Schlesinger's direction comes in is his bringing everything down in tone, particularly evident when Dustin Hoffman's aforementioned Enrico Rizzo, a con man and vagrant, enters proceedings. Like his nickname 'Ratso' might suggest, the man is scrawny and rat-like; a limp born out of Polio killing off his ability to use one of his legs seeing him uncannily skittle from place to place. Cue a series of events which allows Joe to see the real New York, as a well paced bond between the two of them form and the film morphs into this interesting character study about a fast-talking but 'scarred' man teaming up with the self-proclaimed good looking stud whom cannot much talk-the-talk. In short, they get by the best they can without literally pulling a gun on somebody and holding them up.The film is more preoccupied with painting New York as a scummy, sleazy place of apparent no hope; something that hits home even more when we remember the film is initially about an outsider going there with so much of it. Its combining of content of a more down and out; realistic aesthetic, a studying of low level living and a generally nasty existence with people caught up in the middle of it all, with sporadic bursts of a more drug induced; more avant-gardist natured aesthetic in its dream sequences and the shooting of the day's youth down an 8MM camera lens during a rave calls to mind other such films from the era, including 1968's If.... and 1970's Catch-22. The clashing tones ought to alienate the audience, instead it plays its part in the bigger picture of things in projecting itself onto our lead as he realises that, having been situated in New York for 'x' amount of time with little return in what he wanted, a brooding sense of just why things are not making a whole lot of sense is manifesting. The two lead performers make use of the material detailing two differentiating characters in the same locale; events later transpiring to reveal Ratso is in a not too dissimilar position in New York to what Joe was back home, in that a way out is the ultimate goal and a bus ride to Florida remains the elusive dream. The film is very sad and very honest, dramatically involving in its documenting of the plights of these two and really rather well directed; culminating in an affecting, effective piece.",Midnight Cowboy

Re-watching it again makes me notice more great things about it. One of my favorite scenes at the beginning is Joe on his bus trip from Texas to New York. He has many encounters with other passengers, he plays peek a boo with a little girl, tries to talk to an old cowpoke and sits next to a cranky old lady. When he arrives in NY he hears real life DJ Ron Lundy on his radio.The NY scenes brings him some stark reality. He meets up and scores with a sexy older lady (Sylvia Miles) but ends giving her money instead of the other way around. 25 minutes into the movie and we meet Ratso for the first time. He says Joe should work with a pimp named O'Daniel , but he turns out to be a raving religious fanatic. Character actor John McGiver is hilarious in his one scene. Joe is angry with Ratso but they end staying together in a condemned building. Joe also has some strange encounters with a weird drugged out woman who plays with a rubber mouse with her son, he also meets a pathetic gay student (Bob Balaban).Joe and Ratso end up at a Greenwich Village party of artsy types with lots of drugs available. Ratso thinks they are all ""wackos"". Ratso's health is failing and he begs Joe to take him to Florida. There is another memorable bus ride sequence. Many have said this is a sad, depressing film but I never felt that way, Ratso dies but it seems like a relief since he is free of the crippled body and diseased lungs. Joe has come to the conclusion he is no hustler and decides to get a honest job. So the ending seems pretty hopeful to me, plus the film has a lot of humor in it so I never thought it was depressing.",Midnight Cowboy
56,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Once considered radical, ""Cowboy's"" modern message is much simpler",8,9 October 2009,"Forty years later, it's much harder to call John Schlesinger's film ""Midnight Cowboy"" avant- garde, but the greatest X-rated film of all time is as much a reflection of the '60s as it is a study of unusual and pitiable characters.Joe Buck (Jon Voight) is a cowboy by attitude, hustler by trade who travels to New York City in hopes of making a killing on the massive numbers of sexually frustrated urban married women. Unfortunately, Joe is not only naive, but all kinds of stupid and he's haunted by a difficult past that comes to us in trippy flashbacks edited like a classic horror film. In the city he meets Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), a scummy pickpocket with a bum leg who offers to be his ""manager.""The sexuality of the film is nothing surprising to the modern viewer, but for 1969 it's conceivable that it was. The original tagline was ""Whatever you hear about ""Midnight Cowboy"" is true."" That gives you a sense of what it was perceived as upon its release. Prostitution is a constant (although nudity not as gratuitous as one might expect), homosexuality is suggested on more than a couple occasions and the sexual liberation of women is acknowledged. That's a lot for that era, which combined with Woodstock makes '69 the beginning of a new one.Look behind the shocking social issues in ""Midnight Cowboy,"" however, and there's a much simpler quality story that most film-lovers watching today will tap into. Religious fanatic Mr. O'Daniel (John McGiver) gets it out early when he questions Joe about his loneliness. From then on, despite the conscious objectives of the film and its characters to try and make a living and survive in a downtrodden NYC, ""Midnight Cowboy"" is about all the characters having the satisfaction of companionship in every sense and on every level.Very little positive happens to Joe because of his lack of street smarts. He keeps getting screwed over or taken advantage of by everyone in the city until Rizzo changes his mind and the two look out for each other. The way these two handle their adversity is the most interesting part and what really allowed Voight and Hoffman to earn their Oscar nominations.Another way the film stands out as groundbreaking is through Schlesinger's direction. Although we're left wanting more definitive answers and insights regarding Joe's bad dreams and flashbacks about his past, they're still edited in a way that makes them critical to the story. We're able to draw our own understanding from how the past and present are stitched together, able to like or be interested in Joe because this abrupt style communicates the psychological impact it has on him.""Midnight Cowboy"" isn't a cathartic story, but more a simple one shrouded in social issues and more radical film-making decades ahead of its time. The way it's best appreciated now is in that light, not in the way it pushed our boundaries and took a bite out of censorship back in its day, but in the fundamental and universal message it comes to and instills in its audience about loneliness by way of unique characters that many of us might find morally questionable. ~Steven CFind more of my reviews at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",Midnight Cowboy

The first time I heard it, I was 4, and it took me to a time, and place I remember, the waiting room of a doctor's surgery. It's hard to believe this movie was made a year before I was born. This movie just joins that pool of memorable fine selective classics. The way this story is told, is wonderfully done, potent, with male hustler, Voight, dishing in his job in as a dishboy, with big dreams of hitting New York, as the next big buck. He's really dreaming, in one sense, parading as the new city stud, where he literally has to accost rich, attractive, (some) middle aged women, back to their hotel room, deluxe, where other New Yorkers, just avoid him. He's not one with much upstairs, and we sympathize with his plight, and lucking out. Voight fits the clunk head character like a glove, where I consider this, to be one of his best ever performances. Though Hoffman will always be remembered as the pathetic crippled con, Ratso Rizzo, where it's a deep emotive performance, it's Voights that really steals the movie, and Hoffman's. Rizzo. is such a pathetic, repellent, character, we want to forget him, The last tragic scene between the two, always stay with me. Both actors are electric. The movie too, leaves many psychedelic, border pornographic images, flashing through your memory. It's bold, push the boundary film making, a story finely told, a story, pathetic and sad, but ultimately one, you won't be able to forget, no matter how hard you try.

As a youngster Joe Buck's childhood was sadly punctuated by domestic violence, sexual abuse, and abandonment. Now an optimistic, young adult, Joe Buck, a small-town Texan boy, gives up his menial dishwasher job, fancies himself some sort of a cowboy-stud (so he dresses the part), and, then, to top things off, naively heads to NYC to make his mark.You see, Joe Buck's got some great plans inside that empty, young head his. When he arrives in NYC, he's gonna be the most rootin', tootin'-est gigolo who ever made the scene in the ""Big Apple"", ever.But, alas, as these things are in life, nothing ever goes as planned. Nothing.And, once in NYC, Joe Buck is quickly met with one truly eye-opening surprise-of-a-lifetime, after another. Yep. You can bet that this particular ""Midnight Cowboy"" is in for a real roller-coaster of a ride, leading him straight to disappointment and failure, like he never imagined possible.When it came to playing young Joe Buck, I thought that actor Jon Voight was right on the mark. To say that Voight's performance was near-perfect would certainly be an understatement. Voight managed, quite nicely, to project just the right amount of ""everything"" into his pathetically disillusioned character.But, on the other hand - As the rat-faced, street-scum ""Ratso"", I hated Dustin Hoffman, big time. I deliberately docked this film 3 stars on account of Hoffman's despicable presence in the story. Overall, I think that Hoffman is a lousy actor.

60,ackstasis,"""Uh, well, sir, I ain't a f'real cowboy. But I am one helluva stud!""",9,10 June 2007,"John Schlesinger's 'Midnight Cowboy' is perhaps most notable for being the only X-rated film in Academy history to receive the Oscar for Best Picture. This was certainly how I first came to hear of it, and, to be completely honest, I didn't really expect much of the film. This is not to say that I thought it would be horrible, but somehow I didn't consider it the sort of movie that I would enjoy watching. This is one reason why you should never trust your own instincts on such manners  a remarkable combination of stellar acting, ambitious directing and a memorable soundtrack (""Everybody's talking' at me, I don't hear a word they're sayin'"") make this film one of the finest explorations of life, naivety and friendship ever released.Young Joe Buck (then-newcomer Jon Voight), dressed proudly as a rodeo cowboy, travels from Texas to New York to seek a new life as a hustler, a male prostitute. Women, however, do not seem to be willing to pay money for his services, and Joe faces living in extreme poverty as his supply of money begins to dry up. During these exploits, Joe comes to meet Enrico ""Ratso"" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), a sickly crippled swindler who initially tries to con Joe out of all his money. When they come to realise that they are both in the same predicament, Ratso offers Joe a place to stay, and, working together, they attempt to make (largely dishonest) lives for themselves in the cold, gritty metropolis of New York.Joe had convinced himself that New York women would be more than willing to pay for sex; however, his first such business venture ends with him guiltily paying the woman (Sylvia Miles) twenty dollars. Though he might consider himself to be somewhat intelligent, Ratso is just as naïve as Joe. Ratso, with his painful limp and hacking cough, is always assuring himself that, if only he could travel to the warmth of Miami, somehow everything would be all right. This misguided expectation that things will get better so easily is quite reminiscent of Lennie and George of John Steinbeck's classic novel, 'Of Mice and Men.'Shot largely on the streets of New York, 'Midnight Cowboy' is a grittily-realistic look at life in the slums. Watching the film, we can almost feel ourselves inside Ratso's squalid, unheated residence, our joints stiff from the aching winter cold. The acting certainly contributes to this ultra-realism, with both Voight and Hoffman masterfully portraying the two decadent dregs of modern society. Hoffman, in particular, is exceptional in his role (I'm walkin' here! I'm walkin' here!""), managing to steer well clear of being typecast after his much-lauded debut in 1967's 'The Graduate.' Both stars were later nominated for Best Actor Oscars (also nominated for acting  bafflingly  was Sylvia Miles, for an appearance that can't have been for more than five minutes), though both ultimately lost out to John Wayne in 'True Grit.' 'Midnight Cowboy' eventually went on to win three Oscars from seven nominations, including Best Picture, Best Director for Schlesinger and Best Writing for Waldo Salt.'Midnight Cowboy' is told mainly in a linear fashion, though there are numerous flashbacks that hint at Joe's past. Rather than explicitly explaining what these brief snippets are actually about, the audience is invited to think about it for themselves, and how these circumstances could have led Joe onto the path he is now pursuing. The achingly-beautiful final scene leaves us with a glimmer of hope, but a large amount of uncertainty. Gritty, thought-provoking and intensely fascinating, 'Midnight Cowboy' is one for the ages.",Midnight Cowboy

Besides drawing a vivid portrait of New York City low life, the film gave a young Dustin Hoffman one of his signature roles in seedy con artist Ratso Rizzo, the only companion to cowboy Joe Buck (Jon Voight) during his first, hard winter in the Big Apple. Screenwriter Waldo Salt presents Buck and Rizzo (and the Manhattan underworld) in a sensitive, sympathetic light which can almost be called sentimental, but his script nevertheless achieves a remarkable depth of emotion which can till be felt today.

63,drqshadow-reviews,The Death of Innocence (and Expectation) in a Dirty Depiction of '60s NYC,7,8 March 2021,"Dreaming of a more glamorous existence, an idealistic Texas greenhorn (Jon Voight) walks out on his mundane dishwasher's life and hops a bus bound for New York City, certain he'll find instant success as a high-priced gigolo. The city, as always, has different lessons in store. Soon, our cowboy's strapped for cash and out on the street, too soft for the harsh realities of his dream job but too proud to accept anything less. In desperation, he hooks up with a similarly out-of-luck grifter (Dustin Hoffman) and the two develop a chemical bond that sees them through some dangerously lean times, while the busiest metropolis on the planet buzzes and bustles, blissfully oblivious, on the other side of the wall.Notorious as the first X-rated film to see wide release, Midnight Cowboy earned its reputation with a risqué subject matter, explicit nudity, glamorized drug use and frank depictions of homosexuality (with a whole boatload of associated slurs). A lot of it still seems daring and edgy today, so I can only imagine how it looked to the viewers of 1969. Then again, there's a chance the setting itself adds a thing or two to the modern shock value. This is a real time capsule of a picture, a breathing document of a city that no longer exists, with an emphasis on subcultures and undercurrents that were pushed out of all the glossy framed photos. It's sixties New York, all right, but this particular close-up is more interested in the warts on its subject's nose and the dirt under its fingernails than the carefully-primped clothes and hairstyle it wears to mask the unsightly bits.The unflattering depiction is fascinating, particularly to someone like me, who didn't live through that era, but the story often plods and telegraphs its intentions, with an unconventional series of flashbacks only further complicating matters. Hoffman and Voight are dynamite together, an unlikely duo whose connection resonates through the smoggy haze, and serve as major boons to a film that could have floundered otherwise.",Midnight Cowboy

I adore the way Schlesinger commits to unflinching realism while being experimental with his editing structure. I adore that the film very much feels like a product of the 60's while feeling timeless and archetypal. I adore the two central performances that are the best from Hoffman and Voight for their entire careers. And yet I still don't know how this film won best picture.It is a class of its own for the Best Pictures. It takes a cynical view of capitalism and Americanism. Schlesinger is quite biting at times. It is influenced by the French New Wave; Joe's disassociation are emotionally gripping as they are narrative incoherent. It deals with male sex workers and sexualizes Joe Buck as an object of desire in a way that doesn't happen with men very often. The film is committed to an sympathetic treatment of not morally upright characters. The film refuses to condemn anything but the system that leads to Buck's alienation. It is (was) the only best picture rated X and the first to have overt homosexual content. This is such a utterly unique film that I cannot believe it got enough support.Like a bolt from the blue this film entered my life and I return to it again and again over the years.

Jon Voight as Joe Buck has never given a better performance and Dustin Hoffman as his ""pimp"" Ratso Rizzo is mind-blowing, particularly since this was his followup to THE GRADUATE.

68,jimbo-53-186511,"""I ain't no cowboy, but I am a stud""",8,23 June 2014,"Joe Buck (Jon Voight) is living in Texas and is unhappy with his job and decides to up and leave and head to New York City. His aim is to become a hustler and take advantage of some of the rich women that frequent the area. Joe naively thinks that if he arrives in New York dressed as a cowboy that he will be able to hustle money out of these rich women. Whilst women do seem to like Joe, he doesn't really have the brains to be a successful hustler. Then Joe bumps into Ratso (Dustin Hoffman) - a lowlife street hustler who Joe initially takes a disliking to due to the fact that Ratso cons money out of Joe. However, when the two men realise that they both share a common goal of hustling for money, the two men set to work hustling as many people as possible with mixed results.....Midnight Cowboy is a truly wonderful film which is a human drama with a real emotional core. The main strength of this film lies with the strong performances from Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman. Voight is perfect as the unintelligent red neck wannabe cowboy from out of town. His southern accent does make him sound unintelligent, but Voight's facial expressions and mannerisms help to create this effect. I've always felt that a convincing accent and sharp dialogue can only carry a film so far - sometimes you need the actor to bring that little bit extra to the table and I feel that Voight was excellent in this respect. Hoffman is also good - his character generally has a meaner edge to him, but he lives in squalor in probably one of the worst apartment in New York. His character has a limp and a cough which will more than likely make the viewer pity him rather than like him. The film flows well and I felt it was told at an even pace, the journey that the two men make was funny, heartbreaking, interesting, moving and on the odd occasion disturbing, but all this is done in a way that is both interesting and engaging.One other aspect that particularly impressed me were the photography and visuals; the editing and photography were fantastic - the part where Joe is chasing Ratso and the dream sequences were top notch. We tend to see this sort of thing more and more these days, but back in 1969 this would undoubtedly have been something that was rather novel. The music in this film is also terrific and includes the wonderful 'Everybody's talking at me'. Midnight Cowboy is an excellent film which is both touching and funny in equal measures. Ratso and Joe at times will bicker together, laugh together, and suffer together, but it's a journey you'll be glad you took time to make with them. Right from the moment Joe sets off to New York to the rather moving end, this is a rewarding and enjoyable experience. If you haven't seen Midnight Cowboy then I strongly suggest you watch it as it is an excellent film both visually and emotionally.",Midnight Cowboy

71,slokes,All The Lonely People,6,8 February 2008,"Not unlike a lot of other screen classics but more than many of them, ""Midnight Cowboy"" is a movie I enjoy thinking about more than I do actually watching.Like say Nilsson's ""Everybody's Talking'"" comes on the radio, and I get a picture in my head of that clueless Stetson-wearing greenhorn Joe Buck (Jon Voight) chewing gum as he walks through a sea of New Yorkers, blissfully ignorant of all that lies ahead. It's a great image and a great tune, reminding me of when I was young and the world was a less ornery if just as confusing place. Yet the song exists in the movie only as a kind of fleeting counterpoint to life's meaningless brutality.The crux of ""Midnight Cowboy"" involves Buck's desperate friendship with tenement bum Enrico ""Ratso"" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), who tries to help Buck find work as a gigolo on the fly. Buck dreams of making it in the Big Apple, while Rizzo dreams of escaping to Florida, home of life's twin necessities, ""sunshine and coconut milk"". In ""Midnight Cowboy"", dreams exist only to break your heart.Voight is great in his debut starring role, and ""Midnight Cowboy"" is always interesting if hardly inspiring. Manhattan itself becomes a leading character in the way it is shot by DP Adam Holender. Take the moment Buck arrives at his hotel, and looks out at a busy street where from one side a marquee advertises ""The Sound Of Music"" and on the other a billboard markets cheap whisky.It's an ugly place filled with ugly people. Hoffman wears a pair of scuzzy dentures as Rizzo, and scrunches his famous nose up so much you understand where the nickname came from. Joe's first gigolo encounter, with shrill, aging Cass (Sylvia Miles), played for laughs as she plays him for money, sets the tone of sordid misery picked up by so many other characters. It's not that the characters here live so miserably that's depressing, but that they deserve to.Occasionally director John Schlesinger throws in some odd fantasia, Joe remembering some awful rape or imagining himself chasing Ratso around the subways, which made ""Midnight Cowboy"" even more happening a film in 1969 and rather more dated now. A sequence involving a wild drug party at Andy Warhol's famous Factory seems to exist mostly for self-conscious hipness. More obscure and fascinating are the many scenes where Joe encounters homosexuals, each so pathetic and self-loathing they would excite gay protests if they appeared on screen today.What makes ""Midnight Cowboy"" work as much as it does is the undeniable chemistry of Hoffman and Voight; the occasional arresting image (a distant figure waving from a landscape, a dog being fitted with underwear); and that great score, not just ""Everybody's Talking'"" but the rest of the music including the title theme, also a hit in its day. Nilsson even had another song for the soundtrack that he wrote and performed himself, ""I Guess The Lord Must Be In New York City"", which sounds so much of a piece with ""Talkin'"", a song he didn't write, that you almost wish it had gone in, too.Then again, with a title like that, I sort of doubt it had a chance.",Midnight Cowboy
72,EUyeshima,Two Stellar Performances and a Pervasive Honesty Make This One Still a Winner,9,5 April 2006,"It's not quite the timeless masterpiece you would hope it would be based on the acclaim it garnered, but 1969's ""Midnight Cowboy"" is still a powerhouse showcase for two young actors just bursting into view at the time. Directed by John Schlesinger and written by Waldo Salt, the movie seems to be a product of its time, the late 1960's when American films were especially expressionistic, but it still casts a spell because the story comes down to themes of loneliness and bonding that resonate no matter what period. The film's cinematic influence can still be felt in the unspoken emotionalism found in Ang Lee's ""Brokeback Mountain"".The meandering plot follows Joe Buck, a naive, young Texan who decides to move to Manhattan to become a stud-for-hire for rich women. Full of energy but lacking any savvy, he fails miserably but is unwilling to concede defeat despite his dwindling finances. He meets a cynical, sickly petty thief named ""Ratso"" Rizzo, who first sees Joe as an easy pawn. The two become dependent on one another, and Rizzo begins to manage Joe. Things come to a head at a psychedelic, drug-infested party where Joe finally lands a paying client. Meanwhile, Rizzo becomes sicker, and the two set off for Florida to seek a better life. This is not a story that will appeal to everyone, in fact, some may still find it repellent that a hustler and a thief are turned into sympathetic figures, yet their predicaments feel achingly authentic.In his first major role, Jon Voight is ideally cast as he brings out Joe's paper-thin bravado and deepening sexual insecurities. As Rizzo, Dustin Hoffman successfully upends his clean, post-college image from ""The Graduate"" and immerses himself in the personal degradation and glimmering hope that act as an oddly compatible counterpoint to Joe. The honesty of their portrayals is complemented by Schlesinger's film treatment which vividly captures the squalor of the Times Square district at the time. The director also effectively inserts montages of flashbacks and fantasy sequences to fill in the character's fragile psyches. Credit also needs to go to Salt for not letting the pervasive cynicism overwhelm the pathos of the story. The other performances are merely incidental to the journeys of the main characters, including Brenda Vaccaro as the woman Joe meets at the party, Sylvia Miles as a blowsy matron, John McGiver as a religious zealot and Barnard Hughes as a lonely out-of-towner.The two-disc 2006 DVD package contains a pristine print transfer of the 1994 restoration and informative commentary from producer Jerome Hellman since unfortunately neither Schlesinger nor Salt are still living. There are three terrific featurettes on the second disc - a look-back documentary, ""After Midnight: Reflections on a Classic 35 Years Later"", which features comments from Hellman, Hoffman, Voight and others, as well as clips and related archive footage such as Voight's screen test; ""Controversy and Acclaim"", which examines the genesis of the movie's initial 'X' rating and public response to the film; and a tribute to the director, ""Celebrating Schlesinger"".",Midnight Cowboy
73,ptb-8,almost perfect time capsule of 1969,8,1 March 2012,"I saw MIDNIGHT COWBOY in easter 1970 when i was 15. It was at a very quiet matinée in a very cold rural mountain holiday resort town in in Australia. I was alone as I had gone for a walk but discovered I was in time for the matinée. It was one of the great cinema experiences of my teenage life and left an impression on me that still resonates. After the screening, it was freezing and foggy outside and almost dark. I walked to a nearby park in the freezing fog, sat on a wet bench and cried and cried until the tears began to freeze too. I wiped them away and went home for dinner. Nobody the wiser except me. Recently I was the film again for the first time in 40 years. I am simply awestruck at the sense of NY 1969 that floods from the screen, the sense of the time anywhere in 1969 and the fact that the film is shattering in it's depiction of poverty and friendship in a bleak city. Recently I also went to NY and found that as fascinating for I felt NY was completely safe and totally unlike the squalor seen in their lives in the film. NY today is very pretty and epic and like a fun park. I have enduring respect and admiration for this extraordinary film. I hope you do too. The performances by Voight and Hoffman are award worthy, and Joe Buck, like Forrest Gump is the sexy flip side of the American Everyman. Directed by a Brit: John Schlesinger whose International eye for NY and the tawdry but fascinating life of USA 1969 has allowed this film to be as great as it is, only made one other great American films and that is the equally tangible and shocking Hollywood pit of 1937 called DAY OF THE LOCUST. Both films have trailers which every young film maker today should study for a perfect lesson in 'preview' creation.",Midnight Cowboy

75,rbverhoef,"Disturbing in a way, but great as well",9,23 June 2003,"'Midnight Cowboy' was rated X with the original release back in 1969. There are some scenes where you can understand that, just a little. The movie about Joe Buck (Jon Voight) coming from Texas to New York City to become a hustler is sometimes a little disturbing. Dressed up as a cowboy he tries to live as a hustler, making money by the act of love. It does not work out as he planned. After a guy named Rico 'Ratso' Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) first pulled a trick on him and stole some money they become friends. They live in an empty and very filthy apartment. Then Ratso gets sick and Joe has to try to make some money.The movie was probably rated X for the main subject but on the way we see some strange things. The editing in this movie is great. We see dream sequences from Joe and Ratso interrupted by the real world in a nice and sometimes funny way. Dustin Hoffman, Jon Voight and the supporting actors give great performances. Especially Hoffman delivers some fine famous lines. The score is done by John Barry and sounds great. All this makes this a great movie that won the Best Picture Oscar for a good reason.",Midnight Cowboy
76,truemythmedia,Good Character Drama,7,13 June 2019,"I guess I don't know what I was expecting when I went into this film. I'd never seen it before my viewing for this review, but everything I'd read about it online always talked about how it was extremely controversial that this would win best picture in 1969. Originally, this film was rated X, and even the tagline suggested risqué material: 'Whatever you hear about Midnight Cowboy is true.' I suppose I expected something a little more shocking; sure the subject matter could be considered controversial, but the way the film executes it is very tame. Nigh fifty years have passed since Midnight Cowboy first came to theatres, and now it would pass as a soft 'R'. The film itself is a pretty straightforward drama, elevated by the performance of the two leads, the innovative dream and flashback sequences, and the writing. There were certainly a lot of elements I liked about the film, particularly Dustin Hoffman, but overall I failed to see it as an amazing piece of cinema. Good film, it is; tremendous, it isn't.

77,Movie-ManDan,A Must-See.,10,23 November 2014,"In 1969, box-office kings Jon Voigt and Dustin Hoffman were relatively new. Both did a few well- known things before, but they did not have their feet firmly planted and were still ready to tackle the toughest roles of their careers thus far in the most risqué movie they have done. This is the only X-rated movie to ever win the Oscar for Best Picture. Although it is not rated X anymore, this is not one everybody will be comfortable with, but it is one to see comfort or not. Not only did Voigt and Hoffman nail their parts and give the two best performances of 1969, but the movie itself is one to be treasured for a lifetime.Joe Buck (Voigt) is a naive cowboy from Texas who tries to make it as a ""hustler"" in the Big Apple. Buck had been around sex his whole life, and thinks it is the only thing he is good at. There, he meets the severely crippled Erico ""Ratso"" Rizzi (Hoffman) who offers to manage him. Ratso dreams of better health and living a happy life in Miami. As both men struggle to survive in the streets and in the world of prostitution, their bond deepens in an unbreakable friendship. Voigt is dazzling as Buck, but is outdone by co-star Hoffman. Hoffman is one of those ""method"" actors who live their characters out in their daily lives and show no mercy in what to do to be believable. A common misbelief, method is not that. Method acting is recalling emotional and sense memory. Ratso walks with a limp as he suffers from polio, so Hoffman actually put rocks in his shoe to keep his limp real. Ratso's inner health is also deteriorating and brutally coughs throughout the movie, so Hoffman tried so hard to makes the coughs be believably brutal, that he actually puked in on take. Hoffman's overall health in this film is so bad, some viewers may actually be uncomfortable. Both Hoffman and Voigt give arguably the best performances of their careers. Aside from the acting, the themes of survival, loyalty and friendship are all played out vibrantly. It is strong character-driven movies with sold and, sometimes provocative, themes that I love.4/4",Midnight Cowboy

I never feel a lot of desires to watch but i have hear a lot of things about it; the other day i was checking some of my dad's old tapes and he owns this film. So i remove the dust of the video tape recorder and watch this film that i really like . The plot is simple but good, showing two characters full of hopes with a very strong friendship. The character of Jon Voight is a confused man, i don't know what does he imagine when he arrive to New York, an easy job with several women and a lot of money but soon all of his hopes will end and he will be in a mad world alone. The other character, the one of Hoffman, is another strange man, first he seems to be just another guy from the ""mad"" world in which Joe was suffering a lot. He was a swindler but in the end he is the only one who brings some help to Joe, from that their friendship starts and never ends.As i said the performances of Voight and Hoffman are just memorable. I like more the character of Hoffman but Voight's one is great too. The cast is another favorable aspect of the film.Conclusion: i really like this film.Great music that works perfect in every scene, with some amazing and very original scenes (like the party or the way two scenes are showed at the same time)and a great but sad end.

79,framptonhollis,"a brilliantly told, heartbreaking story",9,29 March 2017,"Covering themes of friendship, sexuality, and poverty, ""Midnight Cowboy"" remains one of the most powerful films of all time. It tells the simple story of a kind hearted man with a traumatizing past who moves to New York in order to become a hustler. Over time, he befriends the sick, slimy, and impoverished Rico ""Ratso"" Rizzo as the two follow a path of homelessness and failure, but there is light at the end of the tunnel.""Midnight Cowboy"" covers many taboo subjects as it explores male prostitution and homosexuality, making it heavily controversial in its day (it was originally given an X rating), but today it is fairly tame compared to most modern R rated films. Still, this is a mature and adult film not only because of its often graphic content, but because of how damn heavy and complex its emotions are. The two leads are not necessarily good or bad guys, they are the type of people who you occasionally glance on the city street. Typical bums trying to make some cash. But, in ""Midnight Cowboy"" they become memorable and well developed characters; people that you can relate to and despise. They have moments of victory and moments of sorry, and you often find yourself unexpectedly rooting for this pair that would normally remain nothing but an extra in your everyday life, only receiving ridicule and brief mild sympathy.",Midnight Cowboy
80,nycritic,An Unlikely Friendship Tested Among Shattered Dreams,10,5 March 2005,"Joe Buck (Jon Voight) decides he's going to leave his small life in Texas and make it big in the Big City. The women are there for the asking and the men are mainly ""tutti-fruttis."" Wide-eyed, he comes to New York City, not prepared for the series of humiliating misadventures he experiences, one worse than the other. In the middle of that chaos, he meets and befriends Rico ""Ratso"" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffmann), a homeless-looking man who lives in an apparently condemned building.There isn't much of a story as MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a series of vignettes destined to bring forth not only Joe Buck's plights in the City, but also inter-cut to his past and show us in shock cuts and semi-psychedelic dream sequences snippets of his past: his failed relationship with his girlfriend Annie (Jennifer Salt) who was gang-raped, his abandonment by his mother, and his apparent abuse by his grandmother, who also had a habit of hustling men for money. An air of pessimism dominates the film almost from the wistful beginning as Nilsson plays throughout the opening credits his deceptively flowery ""Everybody's Talking'""; we feel that even while we want Joe to eventually make his mark in the City, the odds are high he won't and will end up working for pennies in a dead-end job -- shown in a masterful shot from his outside point of view later in the film as he watches a man work as a dishwasher in a soup kitchen through a window and sees himself. We know from the look in his eyes he does not want to end like this.A dark story of dashed hopes, John Schlesinger creates haunting images of lost souls at the end of the 60s, and at the center, the prevailing friendship between two men as they struggle to make some sort of meaning to their lives amidst the elusive comfort of a dignified life. There is the implied notion that they may have been lovers -- Ratso's reaching out to hug Joe in the party scene and their the final embrace at the end certainly points at this -- but this is essentially a buddy film, one that manages to survive, literally, to the death, and bring some form of hope to Joe who at the end in Florida seems much changed, older, wiser.",Midnight Cowboy
81,Kingslaay,Hoffman and Voight give praiseworthy performances,7,30 May 2017,Midnight Cowboy is a film where the individual parts are better and stand apart from the film as a whole. The performances from Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are so masterful they almost exist apart from the message or overall story of this film. The cowboy and ratso bring so many unique elements that there is so much going on apart from the films plot. It is almost as if these two great performers were underused and maybe a deeper message or messages could be delivered. On its own it's a decent film about the harsh realities of life in New York and the unlikely bonding of disparate characters who rely on each other for survival. While this great premise looked promising on paper the reality of it on the screen and the great performances made it bigger than what it was. It is as if Joe Buck and Ratso could take on a reality of their own that is independent from the films premise. The integrity and strength of these two characters could start a life of its own which cannot be contained by the films plot. I felt perhaps different direction and plot points could have done this film favors. We could have done without Joe Buck's flashbacks and had more screen time for the two. Perhaps the two could have undertaken a big scheme together that could have been driven by their unique chemistry as opposed to the thin pimp/cowboy escort premise.,Midnight Cowboy
82,jacobs-greenwood,"Probably one of the most overrated Oscar winners, valueless characters",5,11 December 2016,"The big deal about this film is the fact that it was the first X- rated movie to win Best Picture (BTW, it was re-rated R in 1971 without being reedited). Otherwise, it just doesn't hold up.Sylvia Miles 6-minute performance received a Best Supporting Actress nomination?! Though not a strong year for ""Great Movies"", I'd have voted for Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969) instead.Director John Schlesinger and the Adapted Screenplay also won Oscars.

Instead, he finds that the mean streets of New York aren't as inviting as he hoped. However, he does manage to hatch an unlikely friendship with a streetwise lowlife (Dustin Hoffman) who's doing just as poorly as he is. Amid the struggle to attain their dreams of living the good life the two form a bond akin to brotherhood.The acting is perhaps the film's strength, with both Jon Voight & Dustin Hoffman being rewarded with Oscar nominations for their convincing, compassionate portrayals of outcasts. Sylvia Miles also received an Oscar nomination for her small role. There's little else worth remarking on but keep an eye out for Bob Balaban in his film debut.The film's Oscar for adapted screenplay reflects the story's emotional impact but I expect that it also got extra credit for tackling taboo subject matter. Nowadays, of course, this sort of thing is less remarkable but the story is still good, if not as great as it's reputation suggests.The Oscar-winning direction by Schlesinger is well handled but sometimes goes overboard with stylization. Some of the visuals are very 'of their time'. The music, on the other hand, is one of the most memorable aspects of the film. Harry Nilsson's ""Everybody's Talking'"" is classic and the rest of the music fits the film nicely.Ultimately, I think that ""Midnight Cowboy"" is worth viewing but I have some reservations. Barring the late stages of the film I find the story somewhat aimless & uninvolving. Granted, the film was undeniably daring for the time, but I think that it gets too much credit for this. That being said, there are nevertheless parts of the film that are worthy of classic status.",Midnight Cowboy
84,KUAlum26,Powerful,9,10 July 2005,"The freshly minted ratings system was applied to this film,full of very strong content. I believe at the time the ""X"" rating was being used more faithfully and thus,serious movies with objectionable material would get this rating,not so much the porn flicks it would get associated with. In little over five years, the ""X"" rating would be almost useless and exploited by adult filmmakers to sell how raunchy their movies were(e.g. the more Xs a movie had on it,the more graphic and hardcore it was).Still,I can understand where the ratings board was coming from on this film,in the sense that movies like ""Midnight Cowboy"" were rarely(if ever)made,and I doubt many mainstream audience in 1969 America were ready to sit through the story of the haunted and disenfranchised --yet amazingly still basically good-natured--male prostitute(Jon Voight)from out of town and his friendship with a deteriorating,bitter,streetwise loner(Dustin Hoffman) as they try to survive on the cold,unforgiving streets of New York City. The themes of prostitution,drugs and homosexuality are always difficult to examine in a true and unflinching way even now,let alone for filmmakers and audiences at the end of the 1960s.The one thing I got out of this movie was loneliness. The prevailing theme of this film was a sense of everybody out for themselves. And in this world of lonely,desperate people who walk the streets of a busy city,two people, an outsider and a lifelong resident,feel that they have no choice BUT to bond in spite of their differences. The direction by John Schlesinger,the cinematography and the musical score--a series of solo pieces by Danish jazz harmonica player Toots Thielemanns--all powerfully bring to full,brutal life the feeling of loneliness in a city teeming with people.The rating aside,this is a powerful film that probably could be remade now.

85,capkronos,An all-time favorite of mine.,10,10 June 2002,"In my opinion, this is one of the greatest movies ever made in America and it deserved every single award it won and it's place on the AFI Top 100 list (though it's shamefully too low on the IMDB Top 250 list, at only #183 as of this writing). If you enjoy acting of the highest calibre (Voight and Hoffman are a superb match), well-drawn characterizations and inventive direction, editing and cinematography, you'll love this just as much as I did. Schlesinger paints a vivid, always credible picture of the late 60s New York City scene and it's many victims struggling to overcome personal demons and survive amidst the amorality, poverty and hopelessness of 42nd Street, New York City.The filmmaking techniques employed here brilliantly capture the feel of the underground New York film movement (and of the city) and are nothing less than dazzling. I've seen many ideas (including the rapid-fire editing, the handling of the voice-over flashbacks, the drug/trip sequences and the cartoonish face slipped in during a murder scene to convey angst and terror) stolen by other filmmakers.The relationship between Joe and Ratso is handled in such a way as to be viewed as an unusually strong friendship OR having it's homosexual underpinnings. I think the director handled this in a subtle way not to cop out to the censorship of the times, but rather to concentrate his energies on the importance of a strong human connection in life, whether it be sexual or not.MIDNIGHT COWBOY is a brave, moving film of magnitude, influence and importance that has lost absolutely none of it's impact over the years, so if you haven't seen it, you're really missing out on a true American classic.

86,Cosmoeticadotcom,Good,8,1 September 2010,"Midnight Cowboy (the name was then contemporaneous slang for a male prostitute) is one of those solid, well-made films, from the 1960s that's best recalled than watched. This is not to say it's a bad film. It's not. It's a good, occasionally very good film- especially in terms of editing, cutting, and realism, but in many ways it's an interesting short subject film of 25-30 minutes' length, blown up to four or five times its optimum running time. The film was adapted by Waldo Salt, from a 1965 novel of the same name, by James Leo Herlihy, and directed by veteran journeyman filmmaker John Schlesinger. I use that term to describe the director because much of the film is pedestrian, in what occurs, how it is interpreted by the actors, and in its routine banality. However, this acts as a good setup for the flights of fancy and supposed recollection that litter the film, even if the pedestrian-ness of the bulk of the film is rather banal. Of course, most critics praise the banality as realism, again showing what the carrying of even a pocket dictionary could do to ameliorate film criticism.That stated, let it not sound like I'm knocking the film. It is a good, solid film, and an emotionally enjoyable one, even if what it says about humanity is rather plain. In this way, it resembles films of that era, from Easy Rider to Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore. Its initial X rating is an absurdity, for the nudity is brief, and the violence even briefer. The acting is standout. While Dustin Hoffman usually gets the raves for his portrayal of sickly and crippled loser, Enrico 'Ratso' Rizzo, the better performance is turned in by Jon Voight, as Joe Buck, because he has to show emotion in a character whose whole life is acting the part of the dumb yokel cowboy to try and 'sucker' city slicker women with his lovemaking abilities. Even better than the lead duo is the supporting cast of Sylvia Miles- as a Manhattanite bitch who cheats Voight out of cash; John McGiver as a psychotic pimp turned evangelist; Brenda Vaccaro as another horny Manhattanite diva; and Barnard Hughes and Bob Balaban as homosexuals who use Voight for sex and end up getting manhandled by him- the former with violent results the viewer never learns the full scope of. The film won three Oscars- for Best Screenplay, Best Picture, and Best Director, but only the last is really justifiable. The screenplay has merits, but too many flaws to name, and there certainly were better films that year. However, the solidity of the screenplay is heightened by Schlesinger's direction, editing, and the cinematography of Adam Holender. The use of black and white dream sequences for Joe, the uber-color of Ratso's fantasies, the psychedelic sequences at an Andy Warhol Factory Party; all make the film stylistically interesting and innovative, far above its rather pedestrian theme of the decency of the common man.",Midnight Cowboy
87,lambiepie-2,One of the top 25 of the 20th Century,10,28 December 2000,"I saw this film for the first time uncut in 1995. I was too, too young to see it when it came out. But when it did come out, it was rated ""X"". At that time ""X"" meant adult content, not what it would come to be known for with the release of ""Deep Throat"" only a mere four years later. ""Midnight Cowboy"" was a wonderful piece of film making...disturbing, horrific and yes, sad. To me it was one of the only films about ""friendship"" that didn't show lovely colors, vibrant fields and everyone singing happy songs. New York City is not like this any more but if you ever want a piece of New York City history before Disney got hold of it, Midnight Cowboy is it. Jon Voight was wonderful as Joe Buck (and in history it was actually another named actor who had the part but had another part so the Producers couldn't wait for him!) and Dustin Hoffman as slimy Ratso Rizzo was just perfect. We know why these actors are great in their craft just from this film. It's not pretty. You have to reach deep down as an actor to develop the adult content as such in this movie. (I did get to read the book so there's much more I know about this than what is in the movie).It's not going to be a palatable story for most, and for its time, it was pretty revealing. Quite a rough lesson for a youngster to an adult transition, not fully knowing the world, but expecting much out of it for all the wrong expectations. How does one 'grow up' with such horrid experiences in a small town to move into big City life? Here he gets the world....to experience being dead broke, finding humanity, accepting friendship (on MANY levels) and finally being left alone in this world to learn from it all.

88,bmacv,"The Big Street updated to the sleazy '60s, still sentimental but mainly unpleasant",6,26 February 2005,"The only X-rated movie ever to nab the Academy Award for best picture, Midnight Cowboy plays like a druggy, grind-house remake of 1942's The Big Street, a Damon Runyon vehicle in which endearing simpleton Henry Fonda pushes wheelchair-bound witch Lucille Ball from the cold streets of Manhattan through the Holland Tunnel and all the way to balmy Florida, where she dies.The Fonda character is taken by Jon Voight as Joe Buck, a six-foot slab of blond beefcake out of Texas (where a dimly referenced past seems to include a history of sexual abuse by a grandmother plus a homosexual gang rape). He rides the Big Dog to New York, where he hopes to cut a wide swath as a swain to wealthy women. Instead, he crosses paths with a ""crippled"" street-smart street person, played by Dustin Hoffmann as Rico (""Ratzo"") Rizzo  the Ball part. And the only emotional thrust in the movie lies in their sexless, antagonistic romance (and the heat kindled by its two stars  offscreen, two New York actors on the make as single-mindedly as the characters they portray).Other than that, the movie's off-puttingly chilly, almost repellently misanthropic. Director John Schlesinger turns an avid eye on the grotesques and misfits and just plain wretched of the earth who seem to reach critical mass in a metropolis, but shows scant pity for them  they're just dress extras for his soulless carnival. He enlists a whole ladies' auxiliary of over-made-up old Janes gawking at the goings-on, as though it weren't the director himself doing all the gawking.In scene after scene, shot after shot, he opts for the cheapest gimmick, squelching any hint of complexity in his vast cast of supporting players. John McGiver, for example, may well be a pitiful old queen who got religion once he could no longer score tricks, but the pulsating plastic Jesus behind the bathroom door of his seedy, SRO hotel lingers as a spiteful, unwarranted detail. Just as unconvincingly  unworthily  staged are Buck's encounters with over-the-hill rich roundheels Sylvia Miles (where she out-hustles the hustler out of 20 bucks), scared-stiff schoolboy Bob Balaban (in the balcony and bathroom of a 42nd Street sex-and-cinema palace), and mama's-boy oldster Barnard Hughes (who gets a telephone receiver crammed into his dentureless mouth instead of what he hoped and paid for).Schlesinger was good with actors, and was in the vanguard in pushing for edgy material  particularly about homosexuality  long before it became reasonably mainstream (he was gay himself and open about it in a Hollywood which preferred circumspection, i.e. the closet). Though it may be unchivalrous to speak ill of the recently departed, he was an uneven, almost mediocre director. His work suffered either from suffocatingly stately and prim taste (Far From The Madding Crowd) or catastrophic lapses of it (Day of The Locust). If he made one movie that approaches a masterwork, it's not Midnight Cowboy, it's Sunday, Bloody Sunday. And even there he can't take a lion's share of the credit, which belongs to actors Peter Finch and Glenda Jackson, and most luminously to the writer of its unforgettable script, Penelope Gilliatt.",Midnight Cowboy
89,mattymatt4ever,"Pretty well made, but nothing spectacular",7,8 February 2002,"""Midnight Cowboy"" is the type of film I can say is good and pretty well-made, but I wouldn't watch it again.  It's a very unpleasant film to sit through.  It involves two characters who are at the bottom of the barrel of society.  I think Schlesinger did the best he could with this kind of subject matter.  The acting is very good.  Jon Voight does a superb job and so does Dustin Hoffman, though I wouldn't regard this as his best performance.  Dustin's one of my favorite actors, but when I think of him ""Rainman"" comes to mind. I don't think he could've played the role any better, but I don't consider it a memorable role.  The flashbacks and dream sequences are quite pretentious, and get annoying and confusing at times.  I guess 1969 was a time when directors were experimenting with all sorts of fancy-schmancy cinematic tools that they couldn't use back in the day.  And I'm pretty sure the nudity and sexual content was considered shocking back then.  Watching this movie in contemporary times, the explicit nudity and sex in this movie doesn't shock me one bit.  This is basically a character study.  There's no solid storyline here.  The characters are realistic and well-written, but it's hard to engage yourself in their scummy environment.  Nevertheless, they are somewhat likable and I did find the ending very sad.  This is also a movie that exemplifies the power of friendship--a subject that many movies tend to overlook. Especially if it's between two guys.  Nowadays you see a lot of movies about female bonding, but if you make a movie about two guys who love and care for each other it would be considered ""gay.""  I wish people can be more mature and make more films about the power of friendship, whether it's between males or females.  And of course, no one can forget the title song ""Everybody's Talkin'.""  Ever since I watched the movie yesterday, I couldn't flush this song out of my head.  It's such a great song.""Midnight Cowboy"" is a good, but unpleasant and deeply disturbing film that I would recommend.  But if you're like me, you would probably stick to seeing it once.

Look back at the films nominated or considered for the films of 1969 at the Academy awards; Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid, Easy Rider, The Wild Bunch, Paint Your Wagon, Bob & Carol & Ted & Alcie, Goodbye Columbus, True Grit, Anne of a Thousand Days, The Prime of Miss Jean Brodie, Cactus Flower, Hello Dolly, Z, They Shoot Horse Don't They and The Sterile Cukoo among them. For this to get Best Picture and Best Director as an X-rated movie as it was originally rated then which later became an R and to win that and be so recognized out of some great memorable films for that year is quite a statement. A great cast with great chemistry between the Principal actors in Dustin Hoffman and John Voight with wonderful support from Sylvia Miles, John McGiver, Brenda Vacaro, Barnard Hughes and Ruth White. A lot of movies departed from your typical Hollywood feature around this time and this helped lead the way and abandoned the Hollywood Movie for American Cinema.

91,dglink,"Before ""Brokeback Mountain,"" there was ""Midnight Cowboy""",10,3 March 2006,"A quarter century before ""Brokeback Mountain"" was acclaimed as a great gay love story, John Schlesinger's ""Midnight Cowboy"" had already broken the same ground, although in a subtler manner. Anyone who misted up at the sight of Jack's denim jacket within Ennis's shirt will certainly be moved by the ending of ""Midnight Cowboy."" Joe Buck and Ratso Rizzo are not as ideally coupled as Ennis and Jack, although all four men considered themselves to be straight, and at least three of them had sexual relations with women. Joe Buck is a self-styled stud from Texas, who arrives in New York City intent on making his fortune by servicing the sex-starved ladies of Manhattan. Enter Ratso Rizzo, a lame, sick con man, who scratches out an existence on the fringes of society. After an initial swindle, Ratso senses an opportunity in the naive young Joe. He offers Joe shelter in his rooms within an abandoned building after the Texan has run through his meager funds. Joe and Ratso make an ""Oscar and Felix"" odd couple. However, a bond grows between the two men as the roles shift from Ratso's seeking to help Joe establish himself as a hustler to Joe's becoming the protector and provider for a seriously ill Ratso.While there is no implicit or implied sexual relationship between the two men, only the purposely blind could fail to see that love grows between them as Ratso becomes increasingly dependent on Joe and Joe assumes a care-giving role. However, the sexual orientation of Joe Buck is ambiguous. While he has bedded his girlfriend in Texas and a couple of women in New York, he also allowed a young male student to perform a sex act on him in a theater and went back to the hotel room of an older man with the apparent knowledge of the man's intentions. Although ostensibly imitating Paul Newman's image in ""Hud,"" Joe's cowboy attire, which is complete with boots, fringe, and stetson, are iconic gay apparel, and Ratso tells him so. Ratso's orientation is also ambiguous, and his sexual virginity was made clear. Thus, there is no barrier to assuming that Joe and Ratso had feelings for each other that were similar to those between Ennis and Jack.Schlesinger set his love story against the flash and grime of 60's New York, and his visual style is replete with flashbacks, quick cuts, and black-and-white scenes. Although the film basically follows Joe's adventures in the big city and his relationship with Ratso, there is not a dull moment, and, like ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Midnight Cowboy"" is a time-capsule look at the pimps, drug culture, and sleaze of 42nd Street during the pre-Giuliani days. Surrounded by colorful supporting performances from Sylvia Miles, Brenda Vaccaro, Barnard Hughes, and John McGiver, Jon Voight as Joe Buck and Dustin Hoffman as Ratso Rizzo have arguably never been better. Add Fred Neil's song ""Everybody's Talking' at Me,"" Adam Holender's cinematography, and Hugh Robertson's editing, and ""Midnight Cowboy"" is a classic love story between two unlikely individuals who both happen to be men.",Midnight Cowboy
92,KnightsofNi11,Not what you would expect,8,11 January 2011,"It's an uncomfortable chore but if you can make it through Midnight Cowboy you shouldn't regret it. It is an excellent classic film that became the first X rated film to ever win best picture at the Academy Awards. And deservedly so. It follows the story of Joe Buck, a man from Texas who moves to New York to sell himself as a male prostitute. He slowly befriends the sickly and feeble Ratso who, for a time, acts as his ""manager"" if that's what you want to call it. It's a harrowing struggle for survival on the fast moving urban streets of New York, and Joe and Ratso learn this the hard way as they struggle to make money and find themselves in all sorts of tight spots, some profane and others euphoric. Whatever preconceptions you have about a film called Midnight Cowboy are probably wrong and you really just have to see this film for yourself to understand what its all about.Midnight Cowboy can be an uncomfortable film to watch but, to me at least, that makes it all the more memorable. It takes a lot of risks with its sexual content, especially for a film made in 1969. But it is all in good taste and all used to artistic effect. The film utilizes a great combination of aesthetics and storyline. I was very surprised at the visual quality of this film and all the aesthetic nuances it uses throughout. The film is very surreal at times and will take you on a very strange and enigmatic mind trip. Scenes will, practically without warning, morph into surreal acid trips that will stun and mystify. John Schlesinger really put forth a lot of effort to piece together meticulous scenes of surreal beauty and keep them appropriate within the context of the film. A lot of these bizarre scenes caught me off guard but made for some of the most visually fascinating moments of the whole film.The film isn't all aesthetic glam however. It is fueled primarily by a very strong story with two captivating main characters. The film will mislead you into thinking it will be a straightforward archetypal western, but then becomes a harrowing urban drama. It tells a dark but unique story that doesn't unfold like you would expect. And the story is powered by two very different but very well constructed characters. They are both multi-layered and well rounded. Both have their flaws but both elicit empathy, from me at least. And of course Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman do a great job in their roles as well. Jon Voight warps the perception of the cowboy hero in the most unorthodox and unconventional ways. He isn't necessarily set up as an anti-hero but instead just misguided. His moral compass is very off, and yet you can only really feel sorry for him and his naivety. Dustin Hoffman's performance as Ratso is alright, but it is undoubtedly dedicated and sincere. The ability of his acting may not be top notch in this film, but it is very apparent that he put his heart and soul into this performance and was, for the most part, believable.Midnight Cowboy isn't your average film, and that is what makes it such a classic. It intricately combines visual flare and a three dimensional storyline to make it a unique experience that encompasses what good filmmaking is all about. It's bizarre transitions from real to surreal make it an enticing watch. It is a very high quality film that can't easily be forgotten.",Midnight Cowboy

He falls in with a tubercular con artist (Dustin Hoffman), and they form an unlikely friendship.Midnight Cowboy is an unblinking gaze at Manhattan's seedy side, where harshness can co-exist with surprising tenderness. At the time, the film looked like a stern response to the consequence-free ethos of drop-out culture. Hoffman and Voight, two very different actors playing contrasting characters, constitute a dream team; by its end, this harrowing account feels more like a rites-of-passage story.

94,gab-14712,An American Classic!,9,12 October 2017,"I love movies like 1969's Midnight Cowboy. They are the kind of movies that are embedded in American culture. They tell a story about the reality of everyday people and the themes explored are ones that people can relate to. I love all different kind of stories, but I find these stories featuring real-life themes to be more meaningful. This is a classic example of an American film-a film with a gritty tone involving the everyday life of ordinary people. The Hollywood studio system began to change in the late 1960's and instead of focusing on big-budget epics, they narrowed their focus down to American dramas similar in style to this film. The 1970's is very popular regarding these kind of films, so stay tuned for future reviews to understand my point.The main theme of the movie is love. But it's not just any kind of love. The movie has overtones of homosexuality, which caused lots of controversy when released. It was unheard of that a movie would feature such things in a movie, but as Bob Dylan likes to sing, ""times are a-changing."" The love interests are between our two main characters, a Texas cowboy named Joe Buck and a New York City outcast named Ratso. At first, they only use each other for business interests. But as the movie progress, a friendship evolves between them. A very close friendship that symbolizes something deeper than that. The movie does not explicitly say the men were gay (although there are some scenes that may say otherwise), but it grows clearer and clearer there is some kind of romantic attraction between the two men. Here is some interesting trivia. When it came out, it received an X-rating. This is the only motion picture to have ever been nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars with an X-rating. People felt like the film would give their children very bad influences, which I believe was a bunch of crap. However in 1972, the film was changed to an R-rating where it currently stands today.This film is essentially a love story set in the good ol' Big Apple. Joe Buck (Jon Voight) is a hustler who is from Texas. He decides to move to New York City to chase his big dream involving lots of cash and women. But very quickly he learns the city in the east is a much different animal compared to his small Texas hometown. He makes some money as a hustler, but he doesn't have very many opportunities. Then he meets a shady man named Ratso (Dustin Hoffman) who deals with the underbelly of New York. They forge a partnership as Ratso decides to show Joe Buck how to make it rich. As the adventures begin to roll on, they might have feelings for each other that they could have never expected to have.These kind of films rely on acting, and it's an understatement to say Hoffman and Voight crushed it with their roles. Hoffman was a rising star with his turn in 1967's The Graduate, but he shows here that film was no fluke. Hoffman's character was not a guy I'd generally root for, but Hoffman gave his character so much sympathy. He was a flawed man who needed a friend and more importantly, needed love. I find it ironic how the character's name was Ratso. Ratso did somewhat resemble a human-sized rat in the movie, which I guess is a symbol for the criminal underbelly of New York City. Jon Voight crushes it in one of his first major roles. The scenes when he first arrives in New York are fabulous and pretty funny. His cowboy hat doesn't look right amongst the clad of people in their business suits and I love how he tried to hustle women in public to no avail. New York is a different beast, my friend. The chemistry between the two are spot-on. From their mutual thoughts on living in Florida to their hustling deals, the chemistry here is something special.The film relies upon the dynamite performances of Hoffman and Voight to succeed, but there is the tidy direction of John Schlesinger who helped changed the face of cinema with his controversial art. There is the strong screenplay Waldo Scott, which depicts the underbelly of American life in a way that it makes it difficult to watch. I only wished he left out that stupid psychedelic party scene of his screenplay. It really did not fit with the tone of the movie and it was cringing to watch, although this is where we can see love come into play for the two characters. This era also introduced using songs in addition to the score. The Graduate began that trend, and the film makes good example from that trend. The song, ""Everybody's Talking' to Me"" is a wonderful song with strong lyrics that add to the story.Midnight Cowboy is an American film that is known as a love story between bros, but it is deeper than that. It's a story about valued friendship. The paths are very different at the end, compared to where they were in the beginning. The ending comes across as tragic, but in a way it is also a very sweet ending. I had misty eyes, but I also had a nice smile on my face. Honestly, there shouldn't have been any controversy with the film. If this was released today, people wouldn't bat an eye at the subject matter. Luckily, the majority of the people loved this film upon release and it became a heavily influential film. Just see 2005's Brokeback Mountain, and you'll see some similar themes. I really enjoyed watching the movie. I was curious at why the film was deemed controversial, but in the end it was just another powerful love story.My Grade: A",Midnight Cowboy
95,SmileysWorld,Unlikely Friendships,7,12 March 2013,"A naive country boy and a timid New York con artist don't exactly conjure up the stereotypical image one has of friendships,but this is exactly what happens in Midnight Cowboy.The film illustrates that friendships can develop out of nowhere and between individuals that one would ever suspect would be friends in a million years.I had to overlook the surrealism,which I'm not really into,and the in your face sexual content which is unnecessary,but I like the basic story that it presents.Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight do some awesome acting here,as always,and I was quite taken with Brenda Vaccarro,whom I didn't realize was so awesome looking in her youth.Good film.",Midnight Cowboy
96,Vivekmaru45,"As Long As I Live, I'll Never Forget This Film.",10,30 August 2013,"Midnight Cowboy is a 1969 American drama film based on the 1965 novel of the same name by James Leo Herlihy. The script was written by Waldo Salt, directed by John Schlesinger, and stars Jon Voight in the title role alongside Dustin Hoffman. The film won three Academy Awards: Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay. To date, it is the only X-rated film ever to win Best Picture. It has since been labeled as one of the greatest American movies of all time.The plot of the film deals with Joe Buck (Jon Voight), a young Texan who works as a dishwasher. As the film opens, Joe dresses in new cowboy clothing, packs a suitcase, and quits his job. He heads to New York City hoping to succeed as a male prostitute. Joe's naïveté is quickly evident. Initially unsuccessful, he succeeds in bedding a well-to-do middle-aged New Yorker (Sylvia Miles), but Joe ends up giving her money. Joe then meets Enrico ""Ratso"" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), a crippled, street con man who takes $20 from Joe by offering to introduce him to a known pimp, who turns out to be a Bible thumper (John McGiver). Joe flees the encounter in pursuit of Rizzo.Joe spends his days wandering the city and sitting in his hotel room. Soon broke, he is locked out of his hotel room and most of his belongings are confiscated. He tries to make money by agreeing to receive oral sex from a young man (Bob Balaban) in a movie theater. When Joe learns that he has no money, Joe threatens him. The following day, Joe spots Rizzo and angrily shakes him down. Rizzo offers to share his apartment in a condemned building. Joe accepts reluctantly, and they begin a ""business relationship"", hustling. The two loners develop a true bond. Rizzo's health, which has never been good, steadily worsens.Joe's story is told through flashbacks. His grandmother raises him after his mother abandons him, though his grandmother frequently neglects him as well. He and his girlfriend, Crazy Annie are raped, after drawing the ire of local townspeople. She is institutionalized, and Joe joins the army. Rizzo's back story comes through stories he tells Joe. His father was an illiterate Italian immigrant shoe-shiner who worked down in a subway station, developed a bad back, and ""coughed his lungs out from breathin' in that wax all day"". Rizzo learned shining from his father but wont stoop to it. He dreams of moving one day to Miami.An unusual couple approach Joe and Ratso in a diner and hand Joe a flyer, inviting him to a party. They enter a Warhol-esque party scene (with Warhol superstars in cameos). Naive Joe smokes a joint, thinking it's a cigarette, and, after taking a pill someone offered, begins to hallucinate. He leaves the party with a socialite (Brenda Vaccaro), who agrees to pay $20 for spending the night with her, but Joe cannot perform. They play Scribbage together, and Joe shows his limited academic prowess. She teasingly suggests that Joe may be gay, and he is suddenly able to perform. The two enjoy lively, aggressive sex. In the morning, the socialite sets up her friend as Joe's next customer, and it appears that his career is on its way.When Joe returns home, Rizzo is bedridden and feverish. Rizzo refuses medical help and begs Joe to put him on a bus to Florida. Desperate, Joe picks up a man in a gay bar (Barnard Hughes), and when things go wrong, robs the man when he tries to pay with a religious medallion, instead of cash. With the cash, Joe buys bus tickets. On the journey, Rizzo's frail physical condition further deteriorates. At a rest stop, Joe buys new clothing for Rizzo and himself, discarding his cowboy outfit. As they near Miami, Joe talks of getting a regular job, only to realize Rizzo has died. The driver tells Joe there is nothing else to do but continue on to Miami. The film closes with Joe seated with his arm around his dead friend.The chemistry between Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman is why this film works. Jon Voight plays his role to perfection. His dreams of making it big are foiled at every step of his adventure. In the end he gives up and is back to where he began. The loss of his good friend Rizzo will weigh very heavily on his soul. This film was rated X, but there is nothing here than than the occasional bare butt and breasts shown. In fact today's film show more trashy scenes than this film. For persons seeking to make a career as a male escort, this is a film you should see before you embark on your adventure.",Midnight Cowboy
97,FilmOtaku,A simple story with complex characters,7,16 May 2004,"-Spoilers Within-`Midnight Cowboy' was nothing like I expected.  Generally, when you watch a movie where the plot is essentially a train wreck waiting to happen, there is a low point, a high point and then a REALLY low point.  `Midnight Cowboy', the story of a cocksure and (briefly) idealistic and naïve hustler from Texas who moves to New York City to make his fortune doesn't have a high point.  Indeed, I found myself actually wanting Joe Buck (Voight) and Ratso Rizzo (Hoffman) to have that brief moment where they actually succeed in promoting and selling Buck's `services' to women (or men), but that moment just doesn't come  this is a film that is brutally real, and anything but glamorous.  The characters of Buck and Rizzo are complex without being heavy-handed, and their portrayal is inspired.  At times the film turned pretty psychedelic, but it was a product of 1969, so it is forgivable.  I found that it was impossible to turn away from the film, even for a minute because Schlesinger's pace and direction are absolutely compelling.  This is certainly not a film to watch when you're trying to get a `pick me up', but it is an important one because it is a fine example of the realism that pervaded cinema in the late Sixties/early Seventies after the largely idealistic and/or melodramatic Fifties.--Shelly",Midnight Cowboy

Meanwhile Buck has flashbacks of a shocking sexual assault on himself and his his girlfriend.The pair struggle by in their squat until towards the end of the film where the pair take a 31 hour bus journey to a Miami (presumably far cheaper than air travel, and it's 1969?)

Life showed him that success in the Big Apple is an issue. This was what he learned from his new friend the sick young man Enrico Salvatore (Dustin Hoffman), also known as Ratzo. The latter lived in conditions similar to the ones common to rats, no hygiene, no food, simply surviving. The worst came in the evening during winter time, no heating at all, due to this fact Ratzo had tuberculosis. What a nightmare in a town thought by many as the best of the world! The director John Schlesinger was able to show that the appearances do not always show the true aspects of a town or a country. Ratzo was the example, he was not a bad man but he had to fight, to steal and to do whatever possible to survive, and at the same time he was Joe's teacher. Ratzo was able to persuade Joe to go to Florida looking for a more benign weather, Joe got the money serving as a gigolo for an old homosexual man, they made it, but Ratzo died. This excellent film is a lesson not only to Joe but to many people trying to emigrate to New York, where you may succeed or you may die.

101,ofpsmith,Funny and depressing. Bleak and hopeful. High and low.,9,5 January 2020,"Midnight Cowboy is a bizarre, hodgepodge, paradoxical masterpiece of both mainstream and avant- grade cinema. After all what other film that was then rated X (though this was eventually changed to an R) has ever won the Academy Award for Best Picture? Joe Buck (Jon Voight) is a young Texas man who heads to New York City in the hopes of becoming a hustler (in this case a gigolo by choice). He meets ailing thief and fellow hustler Rico Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) with whom he forms a bond as the two decide to help each other with their plans. Rizzo wants to set Joe up with women so the two can go to Miami, Florida. We oddly root for the two in spite of neither of them being particularly admirable. Moreover Joe and Rizzo live largely on the edge of society. Joe loses his luggage after he is unable to pay for his hotel room any further and is left without options until he finds Rizzo again and the two live in a squatted apartment in a condemned building. The images of high and low society are juxtaposed in montage and surreal fantasy/flashback sequences. Such a film easily could have gone poorly but Midnight Cowboy doesn't really. It never felt like any of the unconventional elements went too far, as this is still a film with a plot as opposed to pure art house.

Solid performances by Voight and Hoffman are almost wasted by a number of irritating flashbacks and the occasional worthless scene that helped to pad an already bloated running time.

With his cowboy outfit and radio, he heads off to the Big Apple to find his fortune. There he meets Ratso (Dustin Hoffman) a sleazy con artist who also his looking for some money. After Ratso cons Joe out of twenty dollars, they become unlikely friends and develop a unique relationship.Last year, AFI ranked Midnight Cowboy among the top 100 list of America's best films. Some people that I have met contradict this movie as dull and depressing. It is a very depressing movie, for it depicts the slum of New York City's streets of the 1960s. The characters themselves are depressed by their passed and current demons. But I also understand why AFI ranks this as one of America's best movies. Despite the con artists, male and female prostitutes, and nut jobs, there is room for hope and a friendship.I have seen both actors in many different movies and seeing them together on screen is captivating. Both were nominated for the Best Actor award of 1970 but unfortunately neither of them got it. This may have been because of John Wayne (the winner of that year for True Grit) was coming of age and needed an award for something. Nonetheless, their performances are impeccable. I could easily feel for their characters.The film was also excellent in the work of the director John Schlesinger who brought to life the Gomorrah attitude of New York City. The one scene that I felt was extremely well done by the director was the sequence of where Joe and Ratso go to a party that is made up of crazies, drugs, and sex. The camera angles and the styles of editing and color made everything unusual, as if the characters were on drugs, which they were.Overall, I can't say anything bad about this movie. 10/10",Midnight Cowboy

At that point, all I had known of it was the reference made to it in that ""Seinfeld"" episode with Jerry trying to get Kramer to Florida on that bus and Kramer's all sick and with a nosebleed.The movie was great, and surprisingly upbeat and not all pissy pretentious pessimistic like some movies I can't even remember because they're all crap.The plot basically consisted of a naive young cowboy Joe Buck going to New York trying to be a hustler (a male prostitute, basically), thinking it'll be easy pickings, only to hit the brick wall hard when a woman ends up hustling HIM, charging him for their sexual encounter.Then he meets Enrico Salvatore Rizzo, called ""Ratso"" by everyone and the cute gay guys who make fun of him all the time. You think of him as a scoundrel, but a lovable one (like Han Solo or Lando Calrissian) and surprisingly he and Joe become friends, and the movie is so sweet and heartwarming watching them being friendlier and such and such. Rizzo reveals himself to actually be a sad, pitiable man who's very sick, and very depressed and self-conscious, hates being called ""Ratso"" and wants to go to Florida, where he thinks life will be much better and all his problems resolved, and he'll learn to be a cook and be famous there.It's heartwarming watching Joe do all that he does to get them both down to Florida, along with many hilarious moments (like Ratso trying to steal food at that hippie party, and getting caught by the woman who says ""Gee, well, you know, it's free. You don't have to steal it."" and he says ""Well if it's free then I ain't stealin' it"", and that classic moment completely unscripted and unscheduled where Hoffman almost gets hit by that Taxi, and screams ""Hey, I'm walkin' here! I'm walkin' here!""), and the acting is so believable, you'd never believe Joe Buck would grow up to be the distinguished and respected actor Jon Voight, and Ratso Rizzo would grow up to be the legendary and beloved Dustin Hoffman. It's not the first time they've worked together in lead roles, but the chemistry is so thick and intense.Then there's the sad part that I believe is quite an overstatement to call it ""depressing"". Ratso Rizzo is falling apart all throughout the movie, can barely walk, barely eat, coughs a lot, is sick, and reaches a head-point on the bus on its way to Florida. He's hurting badly, and only miles away from Miami, he finally dies on the bus. The bus driver reassures everyone that nothing's wrong, and continues on. Sad, but not in the kind of way that'd make you go home and cry and mope around miserably as though you've just lost your dog of 13 years.All in all, great movie. And the soundtrack pretty much consists just of ""Everybody's Talking'"" played all throughout the movie at appropriate times.

Voight's character Joe Buck is naive and full of childhood dramas. Hoffman's character ratso is well aware of the poverty and scum in New York, he is adapted to this life while Joe Buck is lost in the big city. What mostly surprised me was how negative movies about New York in the 60's - 70's were directed. While Woody Allen's movies about New York were mostly positive and wonderful. If you take ""Midnight Cowboy"" and ""Manhattan"" for instance and compare them to each other you'll see that they are nothing alike even if they take place in the same years and location.

You should see this movie for the acting of Dustin Hoffman as Ratso Rizzo and Jon Voight as Joe Buck. Ratso is a ragged New York street urchin and Joe Buck is a young plastic cowboy from Texas. Joe gets the idea that he'll go to New York and make a living as a stud off all the rich women in Manhattan. Ratso is a sickly street con-man who tricks Joe and then runs into him later. They begin an unlikely partnership. This movie is about friendship and redemption. There's no mistaking that it's a real downer film but it does make its point. Joe's journey through the underbelly of New York spirals into hell as he turns over one rock after another, each one hiding a bigger pervert. There is Towney the traveling salesman, John McGiver as the preacher in a squalid hotel room, Bob Balaban as a teen homosexual. Parts of the film are definitely dated such as the drug laden, swinging Greenwich Village party scene but it does show that aspect of 60s culture. In my opinion, Hoffman and Voight never equaled their roles in this film and Ratso and Joe are two of the most unforgettable characters in film history.

By the end, what the audience has experienced, and the characters suffered through, can't reach the unique form of dark, tangible reality that no fiction (on screen or print) has yet to challenge, or equal.",Midnight Cowboy

111,Idocamstuf,The most annoying movie of all time!!!,4,12 September 2003,"This film had a really bad effect on me.  First of all, the story is completely improbable and dated, and second of all, there is not one likeable character in this stupid film.  I mean its bad enough seeing Jon Voight strutin around town like a horny schoolboy, set to that awful theme song.  Let's see, the worst moment?, must have been the scene were John Voight and Dustin Hoffman were hopping around to ""Orange Juice On Ice"".  A really awful film, full of dull characters and writing.  The is probubly Hoffman's worst film up until Ishtar(1987), and Im still thinking that might have even been better!!  My rating: *1/2 out of ****.",Midnight Cowboy
112,Flagrant-Baronessa,"Stud Joe Buck -- virile and naive, just how I like 'em.",8,1 August 2006,"Just kidding.Seeking greener pastures in the form of hustling in New York City, Jon Voight is young optimist Cowboy (almost Forest Gump-like) Joe Buck from Texas. It does not take long for the Big Apple to mercilessly swallow him and his ambitions whole and very soon Joe is the target of both the coldness of New Yorkers and cons from its street-thugs. Given his pure heart, he takes pity on one of these thugs, Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) and later moves in with him in his wreck of apartment and the two literally struggle to survive.While Midnight Comedy is labeled as a drama, it is best described as either a tragic comedy or a comedic tragedy in my opinion. It is above all a beautiful film that is stylish in capturing the contemporary hippie-vibe of the late 1960s with its mandatory dizzying Warhol-party cinematography and juxtaposing it with ultra-urban New York City. The film crams Cowboy Joe Buck somewhere in between, thereby emphasizing his out-of-place position. We feel for his struggle to fit in, but also to merely get enough money to feed Ratso Rizzo.Midnight Cowboy brought tears to my eyes as it is also rich in substance and projects a lot of heart. I imagine this film must have inspired both Forest Gump with its pure-hearted and out-of-place lead character and, to an extent, the Crocodile Dundee films as it deals with almost the exact same kind of humour - a contrast between country-cowboys and slick New York cosmopolitans. Very compelling and sensationally creative film that I highly recommend.8.5/10",Midnight Cowboy

114,jayjaycee,Welcome to the infernal streets of NYC,9,19 March 2020,"""Midnight Cowboy"" is a 1969 drama directed by John Schlesinger starring Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman. I think I don't really need to explain my endless love for older films, especially the ones from the sixties. It was the era of groundbreaking filmmaking and most titles that hit the big screen during that time are still guide posts for the modern cinema of today, may it be the infamously scandalous drama ""The Graduate"", subtle horror gem ""Rosemary's Baby"" or action thriller ""Bullitt"". All of them contributed something to their time and that's what makes them stand out even as of today. This drama here also has a particular feature that changed cinema forever, as it was firstly given the famous X-rating for the delicate topics it deals with. That's what had my curiosity in the first place and when Amazon had this title on sale, I just couldn't resist. As expected, I wasn't disappointed in the slightest. The film is composed of so many facets that you need to feel in the smallest detail to fully comprehend it. First of all, it's amazing how the film establishes two true antiheroes as the protagonists that you would avoid in reality but that you root for in this fictional context. I mean, one is a naïve and pompous misogynist and hustler who has not the faintest idea of how the world really works and the other is a greasy crook and thief with nothing but bad intentions in all his actions. Yet, the film makes you feel sympathy for them, as well as it let's you more and more comprehend their strangely damaged worldview. They both are the key figures in a story that obviously criticises the American dream. The extraordinary thing about it is that it doesn't rely on the lovely visuals of the sunny California, but rather builds up the nightmare in the nasty streets of New York City. It's a welcome alternation to all the Los Angeles based dramas and stands out with the dark and moody visuals. In the same manner it shatters all of Joe Buck's hopes of how his life in one of the greatest cities on the east coast would go on. Piece by piece, his dreams fall apart and it's all about surviving in the end. Luckily, he isn't alone in this misery, as he has one of the worst best friends in the world on his side. As if Voight's performance wasn't already mesmerizing, Hoffman once again has proven why he's one of the greatest actors of all time. His portrayal of Enrico ""Ratso"" Rizzo ist truly devastating and absolutely impressive all the same, he dominated every scene he's in and sent shivers down my spine, but at the same time doesn't overshadow his equally magnificent costar. It's their unlikely bond, their strange friendship that makes this film so fascinating. Most of this works out so well due to the exceedingly genuine chemistry between them. You really believe them and their shared pains and struggles, it's definitely gut wrenching at times. Even though I think that it could have gone deeper into the past of it's obviously troubled main character, the hypnotising editing style makes up for the missing elaboration of that very past. Now that I reconsider it, it's even more haunting to not know everything about it and makes these nightmarish imagery even more packing. Furthermore, the movie doesn't only send its leads on an infernal journey through the urban canyons of NYC, it also doesn't hesitate to blatantly criticise the American way of life, the extreme consumerism and the indifference of people towards misery, pain and neglect and even openly approaches homosexuality, except from the latter, which endearingly tantalises the emotions, it's these thematic insights that impacted me most and made my stomach ache from the intensity they produced. Only take a look at Rizzo's day dream of an easier life and the comparison of his wishful thinking with the bitterness of his very own reality. Already this scene solely is absolutely devastating and made me incredibly sad. It's uncompromising drama with enough moments of subtle satire and social criticism. I think it's not only the depressing themes and explicit nudity that granted it an X-rating, I think it's also been kind of a prevention measure to keep as many people as possible from witnessing how reality actually looks like. In our society today we're always up to date with all the nasty things in the world, but remember this was the sixties. It must have been a scandalous revelation to many audience members back in the day. The peak of all this is definitely the devastating death of Rizzo in the final minutes of the film. It's as unspectacular as it is not depressing, just notice the reactions of the other passengers of the bus. The quintessence of it is the unconcerned reaction of this one lady that barely takes notice of it and does her make up instead. A film doesn't have to be graphic to be brutal, this scene especially has shown it. In the end, Joe has learned from his recklessness and fatuity, but at what price? The film's obviously stating that people don't care about other people, especially the ones from another social class. It's mercilessly shown that they don't even care if you die. It's this nihilist world view that's as breathtaking as it's bold. All in all, this outstanding drama connects all the right pieces to a devastating puzzle about the failure of the American dream and the recklessness of the American way of life. It has it all, mesmerizing performances and a devastatingly touching story that make it work. It's a nasty, dirty and unexpectedly dark social satire that knows to make you feel uncomfortable at the right spots. You can't escape the undertow of lugubriousness of this quintessential sixties classic and groundbreaking feature of the New Hollywood. It's just too impressive.",Midnight Cowboy
115,patches89,Doesnt doesnt cut it,5,11 January 2021,Here we have an oscar winning film thats quite beloved but upon watching it I wasnt too hot on it and found it relatively mediocre. Jon Voight is Joe Buck (not to be mistaken for Fox NFL and MLB announcer) from Texas travelling to New York who hustles for women who he'll lay with and steal from. He builds a friendship with Ratso (Dustin Hoffman) who is a scruffy down on his luck conman. The relationship they build is pretty cool and the acting is pretty good but the story just wasnt all that interesting,Midnight Cowboy
116,ginocox-206-336968,A groundbreaking film that could have been better,8,8 January 2015,"I've watched several movies from the 1960s and 70s recently and am surprised dismayed at how slow they now seem. In ""Midnight Cowboy,"" Joe Buck (Jon Voight) doesn't get to New York until about 13:29 into the film and even then nothing much happens for several more minutes after he arrives.After viewing the film again, now that I am much older but not much wiser, and having read several reviews and articles about the production, I haven't the faintest notion of what the film is about. I must agree with Roger Ebert's conclusion that the film presents strong performances and enough material to whet the appetite, but fails to live up to its promise and potential.Schlesinger and Salt seem as if they couldn't decide whether they want to tell Joe Buck's story or their own, so cluttered the movie with scenes and images that have nothing to do with Joe Buck, but were strong personal impressions, such as the Warhol-esque party that British directors attend but are off limits to the unwashed masses, and images of New York shot from the wrong angle.Here's my tongue-in-cheek, cynical synopsis: A simpleminded Texas hick's latent homosexual tendencies are awakened when the entire male population of his backwater town collectively decide they would rather gang-rape him than his beautiful buxom girlfriend. He tries to escape his budding homosexuality by dressing in the gayest outfits he can buy and going to New York to become the only straight hustler working 42nd Street. But like the traveller to Samarra, his homosexuality follows him and he finds bittersweet fulfillment in a bromance with a cynical asexual cripple whose physical disabilities mirror his own emotional dysfunction.The movie leaves a lot of questions unanswered. In his hotel room, Joe is shown writing a postcard to a co-worker who is shown receiving the card. But the movie shows several fantasy scenes for both Joe and Ratzo, so we can't be sure he actually sent it. In the next shot, Joe tears up a similar card and tosses the pieces out the window. Who was the intended recipient of the second card? His girlfriend Annie? What happened to Annie? As the police lead her away after the attack, she points to Joe and says, ""He's the only one."" Then she disappears from Joe's flashbacks. Personally, I like nonlinear stories and consider flashbacks a potent tool. And I like stories told from multiple perspectives, provided those perspectives are clearly delineated. But MC presents a jumble of memories and fantasies, some in B&W, others in Technicolor, for Joe, Ratso, Schlesinger, Salt and Holender.And yet the movie won three Academy Awards, including Best Picture, which everybody expected to go to ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid."" Heller was so convinced the film would lose that he didn't even bother preparing an acceptance speech.I wonder if it won the award based on what it represented as much as what it accomplished. In 1969, the film industry was still hobbled not only by MPAA ratings but also by National Catholic Office for Motion Pictures ratings. (Curiously, the Catholics condemned ""Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice"" that year, but not ""Midnight Cowboy."" The vanguards of cinema were the French, Italians and Swedes. Perhaps the members of the Academy rallied around MC because it broke taboos, even though BCATSD was a better film and a more conventional bromance. After MC took the Oscar, MPAA changed the rating from X to R, demonstrating that their ratings are purely objective.",Midnight Cowboy

This movie was perfect. 2 totally different people that bonded and learned from each other. This is a movie about hopes, starting a new, reinventing yourself and living life to your fullest. Jon Voight was not a male prostitute but more of a hustler that did what he had to do to survive in NYC. Ditto Dustin Hoffman aka Ratso. This movie is timeless and interesting side note. This movie is only movie to be rated X to win best picture. Its hardly an x-rated movie and has since been re rated an R. My guess is that the raters being novices erred on the side of caution. Anyway an entertaining movie of male bonding . Fantastic movie and a segue-way for sure of more over the top , controversial movies that were a gateway to the 70s and beyond.

119,jb_campo,Gutsy movie for its time,7,16 July 2017,"I recently watched this flick after seeing a Decades TV show about Dustin Hoffman. Hoffman was just becoming famous in 1969 while I think Jon Voight was pretty unknown still. Ratso Rizzo (Hoffman) is a small time hustler of dubious means living in NYC. Joe Buck (Voight) is a small time dreamer from Texas who gets on a bus to make it big up north in NYC.Buck is a cowboy's cowboy, but he's not really a cowboy. He dresses up in shirts and hats and pants and boots, but he's all image. He wants to pass himself off to hustle women. He ends up with a lot more than he bargained for because he gets taken left and right by bigger hustlers after he gets to NYC. Rizzo ends up forming a loose friendship with him as they co-hustle small time deals left and right. Drugs, sex, and a little rock and roll punctuate their lives together. Rizzo dreams of leaving NYC it seems, dreaming of Florida of all places. They have an adventurous time in NYC and beyond.I felt the story fell somewhat flat in the final scenes. I kept wondering what the point was. It seemed that not a lot of substance was happening. They were stuck, which I guess was the point. When they deal with their own fates as life encircles them at the end, I felt that the Director tried to deliver a message that might have been better delivered. At that point, I thought maybe Joe Buck played too much of the cowboy character, and not enough of a real person. If he intends to change things, it would have helped make it more believable if his character didn't seem so clown-like at times.It was a good story, but depressing scenery of down and out NYC, with two losers trying to get their small pieces of the pie. Ratso, like a rat, trying to nibble every little bite he could out of life. Buck just riding the horse along for a good time, naive forever. Or is he? The story didn't give us enough to know.This film was worth watching for historical purposes. But I'm not sure it was worthy of Best Picture. Enjoy.",Midnight Cowboy

121,patriciogl10,Real and authentic.,9,31 October 2019,"There's truly few moments in cinematic history when films can get so honest and substantial like Midnight Cowboy, which perfectly encapsulates New York City in the '60s, with its rawness, poverty and dispair. Two male strangers form a bond born out of their misery and willingness to overcome their existing problems and to make a living out of something, anything. They come from different worlds but come together to survive in a city that devours the unfortunate.There's a subtle hint at a homosexual attraction between the two, although not explored in the surface, it is still caught in the ambient and does nothing but to enrich the dynamic of their relationship. The city and its people are a wonderfully accurate depiction of New York's reality back in the day, much similar to Martin Scorsese's characterization of New York in Taxi Driver (1976) although much less grim in tone, in my opinion.
Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman both shine in roles meant to feed off each other, not apart. Their dynamic is what brings this movie to life and that dynamic is accompanied and enhanced by brilliant camera work, outstanding direction and superb writing.Dustin Hoffman's famous line was a pure reaction to a cab driver almost running him over, which elevates the moment to a classic status forever
immortalized on film. Midnight Cowboy is an authentic product that packages technical brilliance, honest and heart-felt portrayals and an emotionally authentic display of true filmmaking. It's time you catch up with this unforgettable classic.",Midnight Cowboy

A charming and backward Texas cowboy travels to New York City to try his luck in the flesh trade and gets more than he bargained for. Along the slippery path he meets an equally down and out local and together they shoulder life's heavy burdens in one of the most affecting and memorable portrayals of friendship onscreen. Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight are the central leads and their chemistry carry the film in all its rollercoaster motions. The film is also a nice glimpse into '60s New York and the Big Apple's concrete jungle is showcased in all its urban grime and sprawl with matching sex, drugs, good music and a psychedelic party with a Warhol cast to boot. The flick slows down in the middle but picks up again with a moving ending.

123,galileo3,"A powerful, disturbing film driven by two magnificent performances",9,13 July 2008,"Midnight Cowboy (1969)Number 1 - 1969Top 10 - 1960sMidnight Cowboy is in my opinion a very simple, yet important film. It follows the story of a naive Texas 'cowboy' who leaves his tightly knit community for the big, filthy, sleazy streets of 1960s New York (forget the clean shaven images of NYC today then it was in many ways a terrifying city) to become a male gigolo and make money from rich city ladies. However through a chain of events he runs out of money and he is not equipped enough to handle the bustling streets of NYC. The story evolves as Joe befriends Rico a crippled third-rate pickpocket and they form a bond as they try to survive.Firstly, Jon Voight (Joe) and Dustin Hoffman (Rico) are outstanding in the roles and we get two mature, intensely dramatic Oscar nominated performances (Oscar went to John Wayne 'True Grit', big mistake in my opinion). The performances add significant weight to the whole film.Midnight Cowboy is a simple motion picture but it covers a lot of issues whether social, psychological, emotional or moral. It is about the decaying structure of America, it is about poverty and its harrowing effects, it is about a city with no hope plagued by drugs and crime, it is about a modern society with some weird, disgusting personalities; in many ways this film reminds me of Scorsese's Taxi Driver, although the films do differ slightly, they also share some similarities. Paramount to the story is friendship and trust and its importance in life in whatever social and economic tier you find yourself in.Is the film dated? Yes and no. New York City is a much safer, cleaner city today however the film touches on timeless issues; poverty, friendship, struggle and homelessness.A masterful film, powerfully executed.9/10",Midnight Cowboy
124,fimimix,..painfully magnificent slice of real life..,10,1 July 2006,"Although I love this movie, I can barely watch it, it is so real. So, I put it on tonight and hid behind my bank of computers. I remembered it vividly, but just wanted to see if I could find something I hadn't seen before........I didn't: that's because it's so real to me.Another ""user"" wrote the ages of the commentators should be shown with their summary. I'm all for that ! It's absolutely obvious that most of these people who've made comments about ""Midnight Cowboy"" may not have been born when it was released. They are mentioning other movies Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman have appeared in, at a later time. I'll be just as ruinously frank: I am 82-years-old. If you're familiar with some of my other comments, you'll be aware that I was a professional female-impersonator for 60 of those years, and also have appeared in film - you'd never recognize me, even if you were familiar with my night-club persona. Do you think I know a lot about the characters in this film ? YOU BET I DO !!........and am not the least bit ashamed. If you haven't run-into some of them, it's your loss - but, there's a huge chance you have, but just didn't know it. So many moms, dads, sons and daughters could surprise you. It should be no secret MANY actors/actresses have emerged from the backgrounds of ""Midnight Cowboy"". Who is to judge ? I can name several, current BIG-TIME stars who were raised on the seedy streets of many cities, and weren't the least bit damaged by their time spent there. I make no judgment, because these are humans, just as we all are - love, courage, kindness, compassion, intelligence, humility: you name the attributes, they are all there, no matter what the package looks like.The ""trivia"" about Hoffman actually begging on the streets to prove he could do the role of ""Ratzo"" is a gem - he can be seen driving his auto all around Los Angeles - how do you think he gets his input? I can also name lots of male-stars who have stood on the streets and cruised the bars for money. Although the nightclub I last worked in for 26 years was world-famous and legit, I can also name some HUGE stars that had to be constantly chased out our back-street, looking to make a pick-up.This should be no surprise today, although it's definitely action in Hollywood and other cities, large and small. Wake-up and smell the roses. They smell no less sweet because they are of a different hue.Some of the ""users"" thought ""Joe Buck"" had been molested by his grandma. Although I saw him in her bed with a boyfriend, I didn't find any incidence of that. Believe-it-or-not, kids haven't ALWAYS had their own rooms - because that is a must today should tell you something kinda kinky may be going-on in the master-bedroom. Whose business? Hoffman may have begged for change on the streets, but some of the ""users"" point-out that Jon Voight was not a major star for the filming of ""Midnight Cowboy"" - his actual salary would surprise you. I think he was robbed ! No one can doubt the clarity he put into his role, nor that it MADE him a star for such great work as ""Deliverance"". He defined a potent man who had conquered his devils and was the better for it: few people commented he had been sodomized in this movie. The end of the 60s may have been one of the first films to be so open, but society has always been hip.I also did not find any homosexuality between ""Ratzo"" and ""Joe"" - they were clearly opposites, unappealing to one another. They found a much purely higher relationship - true friendship. If you didn't understand that at the end of the movie, then you've wasted your time. ""Joe's"" bewilderment, but unashamed devotion was apparent. Yes, Voight deserved an Oscar for this role - one that John Wayne could never pull-off, and he was as handsome in his youth.Hoffman is Hoffman - you expect fireworks. He gave them superbly. Wayne got his Oscar. Every character in this film was beautifully defined - if you don't think they are still around, you are mistaken. ""The party"" ? - attend some of the ""raves"" younger people attend.....if you can get in. Look at the lines of people trying to get into the hot clubs - you'll see every outrageous personality.Brenda Viccaro was the epitome of society's sleek women who have to get down to the nitty-gritty at times. If you were shocked by her brilliant acting, thinking ""this isn't real"", look at today's ""ladies"" who live on the brink of disrepute....and are admired for it.The brutality ""Joe"" displayed in robbing the old guy, unfortunately, is also a part of life. You don't have to condone it, but it's not too much different than any violence. ""Joe"" pointedly named his purpose - in that situation, I'd have handed-over the money quicker than he asked for it. That's one of the scenes that makes this movie a break-through, one which I do not watch. I get heartbroken for both.....John Schlesinger certainly must have been familiar with this sordidness to direct this chillingly beautiful eye-opener- Waldo Salt didn't write from clairvoyance. Anyone who had any part of getting it to the screen must have realized they were making history, and should be proud for the honesty of it. Perhaps ""only in America"" can we close our eyes to unpleasant situations, while other movie-makers make no compunction in presenting it to the public. Not looking doesn't mean it isn't there - give me the truth every time. Bravo! to all......",Midnight Cowboy

The narrative is progressed, however, by moments of unconventional imagery, and there are enough such moments to justify calling it an art movie. These moments can be disturbing, particularly the rapid-fire flashbacks and flash-forwards that play in the mind of Jon Voight's faux cowboy character. Traumatic memories and violent urges occupy his mind, though on the outside he seems relatively cheerful. Conversely, his unhappy friend Rico (an amazingly good Dustin Hoffman) has daydreams that are light and escapist. These dissimilar people make a good pair, and the nature of their friendship is tantalizingly ambiguous. The film is certainly dark, but thanks to likable characters and a lot of wry humor the darkness is not unrelenting or oppressive.",Midnight Cowboy
127,frankwiener,"""I'm Goin' Where the Sun Keeps Shining Through the Pouring Rain""",8,20 February 2021,"I first viewed this film as a college student when it was released some 52 years ago. As in the case of Joe Buck, but in a very different way, the world lay at my feet for the taking, or so I thought, and, as in the case of Joe Buck, was I in for the shock of a lifetime. More than half a century later and after many viewings, this classic monument to an entire era of American history has never lost its visual impact. Although it does struggle in the middle to maintain its initial visual stimulation, it surely comes through at the end to deliver a lasting impression. It is one of those movies that lures the viewer into the action by some very skillful directorial and photographic techniques.As good as Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are as the lead actors, and they are indeed both superb here, this film is truly the triumph of director John Schlesinger, who meticulously attended to every minor detail in its contribution to the overall product. If you only regard the impact of the one-scene characters, and there are many here including the bus passengers and the pedestrians on the streets of New York, and the careful placement of individual shots, you will realize how much Mr. Schlesinger as director is essential to the success of this movie. It doesn't hurt to have the talents of Voight and Hoffman, never to be underestimated, and not one but two of the greatest movie theme songs of all time, both John Barry's timeless instrumental and Fred Neil's ""Everybody's Talking"", sung by Harry Nilsson. Above all, however, it is Mr. Schlesinger's directorial brilliance, including his ability to put it all together, which truly distinguishes this gem as the great film it is rather than just another mildly interesting movie depicting the turbulent and troubling era of the late 1960's. Be forewarned because much of the action is indeed disturbing and often displeasing to the eye, at least to my eye, but Mr. Schlesinger has the ability to submerge the viewer into a cinematic spell so that we just want to keep watching, even when it hurts to do so and when we know the final outcome after many viewings.",Midnight Cowboy
128,brefane,Memorable comedy-drama,7,2 December 2010,"John Schlesinger's Oscar winning film is a romanticized country mouse-city rat tale set in a gritty NYC and it benefits greatly from the performances of Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman. Thanks to them and Sylvia Miles the film is memorable. Voight's Joe Buck and Hoffman's Ratso Rizzo are a modern day Oliver Twist and Artful Dodger. Pure at heart, they're two innocents in an otherwise cruel and indifferent world. Miles, Voight and Hoffman earned well-deserved Oscar nods, but the film itself is uneven and episodic, and much of what happens to Ratso and Joe Buck feels arbitrary and unlikely; the psychedelic party is an attempt to seem contemporary while telling a basically old fashioned story. John Schlesinger's flashy directing is clever but distracting, and the intrusive flashbacks are confusing.",Midnight Cowboy

He i now with an old bag, a radio and much dreams. ""He is a hustler, there is a lot of people in NY who wants him"" ... well, that is what he think. When he came to NY, he mets Ratso (I mean... Rico). Since here, in middle of poverty, Joe and Rico going to live together, to be sustained together.""Midnight Cowboy"" is one of the most perfect movies which talks about the dreams and poverty in the United States, before, in that time, and now. How men and women must sale their bodies to be alive, stealing to eat, dreaming in a life, in a different life (There is a few excellent films like this one about this horrible topic, like ""Christiane F."" or ""My Own Private Idaho""). Talks about poors and rich. Drugs and sex, and ""Midnight Cowboy"" show us that, with an outstanding cold scenario with touching performances.I loved this movie, not only for its message, too for it performances (All in the movie are terrific). But there is a special performance, which i want to talk about a little , and is the character that have Dustin Huffman, Rico. Is not only an interesting character with certain charisma, is one of my favorites characters in all the movies that i have ever seen. Rico is guy who just want to live a different life. He lives in an abandoned building where he smokes, in spite of coughs. That certain stutterer and show of sickness makes me made me tremble. Is a beautiful character, who has dreams. Irresponsable and sagacious. Dustin Hoffman's performance is more than impacting and believable, is unforgettable, and that proves which is the actor who knows act.""Midnight Cowboy"" is amazing, a masterpiece that always going to be useful for a society (And i speaks universally) what only want bodies to consume, and then, to bounce to the garbage, so in this way, drift how steal they next meal.*Sorry for the mistakes ... well, if there any.",Midnight Cowboy
130,shepardjessica,In My Top Ten of All Time!,10,1 August 2004,"This masterpiece from early '69 made me want to be an actor.  Easily Schlesinger's best film and a surprise winner at the Oscars.  Nice follow-up to THE GRADUATE for Dustin Hoffman and as the rumpled, dirty little Ratso from the Bronx, he gave his best performance.  Jon Voight is perfect as the ""Texas Stud"" full of naivete and wide eyes in the big city.  Able support from Sylvia Miles, Bob Balaban, and Barnard Hughes.A 10 out of 10.  Best performance = Jon Voight.  X-rating changed to R-rating after Oscar win (shows how valuable those ratings aren't).  The book is even grimier than the film, but it's definitely not a promotion for New York City (especially then).  Rich, involving and real humanity breaks through by the end of this journey.  Don't miss it!",Midnight Cowboy
131,BigJimNoFool,Excellent,10,17 April 2020,First off Jon Voight wow! and Dustin Hoffman too they were great together but Voight absolutely carries this. He is the youthful optimist who does right by his mate in there quest for the American dream as the swinging 60s turned sour.John Schlesinger has directed a stone cold masterpiece here with New York pace and style. I felt ill watching Rico get sicker. I was living in the squalor and felt the hopelessness of it all and at the same time laughed with them too. What a great film and a great job to all involved.

Voight is a naive cowboy from Texas who wants to become a gigolo in the biggest and loneliest city in the world and Hoffman plays a poor invalid kid from the Bronx,always scamming and stealing. The way that the two are stuck together is beautifully filmed.New York is shot in the most dark way,mostly at night (just like the other movies written above).This makes for an even sadder picture which is topped by a sincere but also sad score with a beautiful harmonica through it.Each scene has something nice to offer and they are all very different and complete the story line,there are no loose scenes. Of course,since it is 1969,there is also a pretty psychedelic sequence in the latter stages of the movie.Although the end is not very satisfying (like most other movies written above),it still makes for one of the best movies ever. 9/10",Midnight Cowboy

Throughout my life i had only seen bits and pieces of this film, however the saying is...good things come to those who are patient. I think the word awesome is not enough to define the jobs that both Voight and Hoffman do in this compelling drama of a naive male prostitute a.k.a. drifter Joe Buck (Voight) who hears all the money he can make on the streets of New York cause ""All the men are tutti fruity's"" As he puts it and ""their horny rich wife's will be starving for it"" hence the word ""naive"". Joe makes his way to New York from Texas and eventually meets up with a sickly dirty homeless drifter named Ratso (Hoffman) and a friendship ensues as Joe makes what he can to support and nurture the sickly and crippled Ratso. For a movie that was the first they say to be rated x, as to which i can't understand why however those were the times that on film even brief nudity and very mild language were a no-no! I think i'm not being too bold to state that this also paved the way as being one of the very first ""gritty"" films that pulls no punches showing life on the streets of N.Y. for an average street hustler. This film also did OK at the '69 Oscar awards winning Best Picture of the year as well as winning the best director and writing awards. For a guy who really never enjoyed any classics, i am now looking forward to number 3 on my list.",Midnight Cowboy
135,ilovedolby,Excellent character study,9,21 May 2003,"Originally X-rated, `Midnight Cowboy' was released in 1969 and it was believed that due to its strong subject matter, male prostitution, the film deserved a strong rating. Nearly 34 years after its theatrical release, the MPAA has afforded the film a new R-rating, and it suits the film far better than its former rating. Directed by John Schlesinger (`The Next Best Thing') and starring John Voight (`Holes') and Dustin Hoffman (`Confidence'), `Midnight Cowboy' is a film that gives its audience moments of pause and reflection not only on the issues that it addresses, but also on other social wrongs that exist in society, even after 34 years.	`Midnight Cowboy' is the story of Joe Buck (Voight) who leaves his sleepy little Texas town for the lights of New York City. Naturally, like any young, naïve person, he dreams of making it rich in the big apple.' But his means of achieving that end are as irrational as the day is long-being a gigolo. When he arrives in the city, he encounters a slightly crippled man named Enrico Salvatore Rizzo (Hoffman). After a few miss-encounters with the wrong people, the two become friends and Buck moves in with Rizzo. As such, Rizzo becomes Buck's pimp, to a certain degree, as they try to squander any money possible on the mean streets of New York. 	One can look at `Midnight Cowboy' and simply say that moral is to avoid prostitution-but it's far more than that. The film questions choices we make in life and the roads we choose to go down that may seem enticing, but ultimately lead to what could possibly be a person's defeat. Apropos, this is the situation that Buck encounters in New York. He thinks he's not a great cowboy, but as he would put it, `I'm one hell of a stud!' He's a young man, in his mid to late twenties, and naturally has dreams of being a woman's greatest sexual desire. But at what cost? He doesn't realize the detrimental affect that his actions could have on his life. He's going to have to beg for cash. What's more, the film was made during a time when the sexual revolution and drug use were at their zenith, but to the gullibility of the filmmakers, the issues of STDs and the AIDS virus weren't brought up in the film, as they were primarily unknown to the general public.	Performances in the film were excellent. Hoffman gives a sad portrayal of a man at the end of his rope, with no money, a terrible apartment, and to make things worse he's loosing the use of his legs and he's developing pneumonia. Voight's presentment of the character Buck is superb. Buck is extraordinarily ignorant in his pursuit of his dream, but no more ignorant the Hoffman's character, Rizzo. Rizzo's dream becomes the vision of Buck, as well-going to Miami and basically living off the fat of the land.	Outstanding direction from Schlesinger makes `Midnight Cowboy' a must see. With his uses of quick cuts in the film, lighting, and the gritty atmosphere of a once dingy New York City, Schlesinger provides a dark feel to subject matter. 	`Midnight Cowboy' is not a film for the faint of heart. Modern films that deal in the ideas of the downfall of dreams and degradation of the worlds we inhabit would be `Requiem For A Dream,' and `Summer Of Sam.' As for `Midnight Cowboy,' it's an extraordinary film about characters that suffer from their own downfalls and from their own naïveté. ***1/2",Midnight Cowboy
136,honorhorror,"It was moving, but not for everyone.",9,6 December 2008,"Indeed, what I just saw was a great movie with a heart. All the superior performances and superior editing/presentation made it worthy for the academy award. But there is more than these.For each view of this film, you'd have to choose your position between the doctor and the patient. As a doctor, you will witness all the modern society syndromes(of course, as a perspective of 1969) and diagnose them with your consciousness, and conscience. After all you can prevent yourself totally from personally involving into the main characters' world, mentally or physically. But what's shining in the movie, is the perspective of the patients. If you take the positions of the patients,as either Dustin Hoffman's physically sick person, or Jon Voight's spiritually broken one. As one of these two types of patients, you can allow the main men grow on you, in an effect that the connection between them, the affection become totally nature. I am not surprised that people considering their relationship as homosexuality. But in my opinion, most accurate and original interpretation would be friendship, sometimes compassion or sympathy, since both of them were caught up in the cold and destructive NYC. I've read other users' comments and found out that today's NYC streets are much cleaner than it was in 1969, due to better city management. But I wonder how much cleaner is inside, how much sanity can a New Yorker redeem...Thanks to the smart editing(although sometimes feels dated), the movie leaves the audiences in desperation. The dream sequences and flashback footages finally revealed Joe Buck's past--a lost little boy raised up by his superficial, probably nymphomania grandma. The incomplete family leaves Joe in constant loneliness, as he confessed to one of his customer(Mr. O'Daniel). The world he confronts,either Texas farm or NYC, were brutal and sexually messy. Grandma sex-tortured him, his girl-friend framed him after they were both sexual-assaulted by the hometown mob. Joe Buck then went into jail, and probably joined the army. After his grandma's death, he set off for NYC in the hope of a totally new life. The trip was not really sex-oriented, not like his own description. He went to NYC because his American dream didn't die yet. What really killed his American dream is the societal cancers he witnessed, or infected each time he interacts with newer categories of people. Witnessing his only friend dying of poverty and disease, he decided to help him for his undead dream--which is to go to Florida. Unsurprisingly, Rico died on the bus, died in his way of finding American dream. But there are still more people losing their lives to family malfunction,Sexual immorality,denial-ism......Actually, Joe Buck is the portrait as taking all these diseases but survived, though not cured. What will be his fate? What's waiting for him ahead? The director leaves the answer to the audiences.I was so moved by the movie. I just had to give it a 9/10.",Midnight Cowboy
137,koofasa,True classic,9,11 October 2020,I'm watching this movie more than 50 years after it was made. I was a kid when it was released so I didn't see it in 1969. What I learned is that our society has been on the decline for a long time. The main character (Voight) is a guy from Texas who wants to become a male prostitute in NYC in 1969. It turns out to be harder to do than he thought it would be and he gets mixed up with a guy from the Bronx who is a small time criminal (Hoffman). They show the cool NYC scenes of the time through an Andy Warhol type party while the Texan bubbles around trying to figure out the big city. I won't say how it turns out but it's clear statement of the time this movie was made. Voight and Hoffman do a great job. Too bad they no longer have creative talent that can come up with a movie like this. They wouldn't get past the first scene today.,Midnight Cowboy

Instead, he resorts to becoming a male prostitute just so he and his friend, Ratso, can survive.  ""Midnight Cowboy"" features two magnificent performances by its leads, Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman, who were both nominated for Oscars.  I just can't say enough about ""Midnight Cowboy.""

140,dataconflossmoor,"As America Goes, So Goes The Cinema!!",10,31 March 2008,"Let's just take a moment and evaluate the academy award winners for 1968 and 1969!! In 1968, ""Oliver"" (which was an innocuous musical) won for best picture. 1968 was a year of absolute tumultuousness.. Robert Kennedy was assassinated, Martin Luther King was assassinated, and there were riots on the streets of America from coast to coast on an ephemeral basis. Upheaval at the Democratic convention was an assertive rejection of the structured status quo by this nation's hegemony, and, our protracted involvement in Vietnam was emerging as a volatile avenue for an utterly pandemic disdain!! So!! what movie won for best picture in 1969? ""Midnight Cowboy"".... Does this tell you anything? The 180 degree polarization of these two movies could not be anymore emphatic, it is almost as if the occurrences of 1968 had a profound impact on the choice for best picture in 1969!! Such a radical difference in Academy Award winning pictures in just one year, gave a crystal clear indication of how the social transition in America was indelibly ubiquitous!! Hence, the radicalism of the 1960's was influencing virtually everything!! ""Midnight Cowboy"" is a film which depicts the sordid sexual behavior which was pertinent to the decaying American moral value system which erupted during the 1960's!! Such depraved and detailed immorality had never been illustrated on the silver screen before!! Jon Voight is tremendous in this film, as he engages in precarious sexual theatrics, (which were the antithesis of his conservative upbringing) as a means of supporting himself. What was so demoralizing about this whole endeavor, is that supporting himself with this nefarious occupation completely backfired!! Dustin Hoffman's character goes beyond desperate and hopeless, his situation is tailor made for society to shut the door on him, and pretend that he simply does not exist... New York City is a cosmopolitan venue which has the formidable potential to effortlessly ostracize and socially obliterate their victims of sub level poverty!! The characters Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman play become metaphorically decimated by New York City's cavalier imperviousness.. This film serves as a five alarm fire wake up call for Americans to be aware of the actual United States they live in, as opposed to the United States that is masqueraded around in front of Americans on the Fourth of July!! Significantly prescient for the prevailing paradigm for movies made during this era, the film ""Midnight Cowboy"" presents a circumstantial set of tragedies which will not conquer adversity.. All parties concerned will go from bad to worse, a scenario which directors were reluctant to bring to the American moviegoer's attention back in the late sixties!! John Schlesinger directs this film (He is also known for directing films such as: ""Darling"", ""Marathon Man"", and ""Falcon and the Snowman"" to name but a few), he does an amazing job directing ""Midnight Cowboy""!! Schlesinger won for best director with this picture in 1969! Dustin Hoffman is definitely in a category all by himself when it comes to his acting genius!! The theme song ""Everbody's Talking"" by Harry Nilsson, made its debut in tandem with this movie!! In a nutshell, ""Midnight Cowboy"" was a cunningly relevant tenet for admonishing societal despondence. This film was incredibly poignant, as it denounces a bevy of socially callous philosophies in America!! Fabulous film!! One of my top fifty!! I recommend to everybody that they see this movie!!",Midnight Cowboy

It did not pull at my heart strings, and I kept getting p****d at Jon Voight's character for being so naive.  I thought he was too nice a guy to be real.

146,jbartelone,Thought Provoking Roller Coaster Through New York's Dark Side,8,29 March 2009,"Midnight Cowboy is a highly emotionally charged film that does an excellent job of drawing the viewer into the experiences of male hustler Joe Buck, and his side-kick thief con-man friend ""Ratso"" Rizzo. Both roles are superbly played by John Voight and Dustin Hoffman respectively.Joe leaves his job at a Texas diner in search of adventures in the Big Apple. He longs for exciting adventure and looks to ""score"" with the ladies. Down on his luck, and seemingly unable to get ahead doing anything else, while in New York, Joe meets and befriends con-man Ratso Rizzo who tries to show him the ropes of the big city and how to assimilate to its culture and its people.The movie takes the viewer through a series of rapid disorganized flashbacks for Joe that brilliantly display his confusion and isolation to New York City's always changing culture and people. Joe's mind flashbacks are often very dark, disturbing, and unpleasant. Some viewers may attempt to sort out these flashbacks, but should not try to do this. Midnight Cowboy uses these images to show how everything is happening in Joe's life so fast, that he has no time to slow down to reflect on what he sees and thinks.However, when he learns about the seriousness of Ratso's illness, foreshadowed in the movie by his persistent cough that gets progressively worse, Joe realizes that he needs Ratso for a friend more than anything else that has previously happened in his life. He learns that friendship is not something that you just throw away. Before meeting Ratso Rizzo, Joe appeared to be only interested in sex and adventure, using this as a form of escape from his previous dish-washing job.Ratso shows Joe the importance of compassion and humanity. Joe tries to help him overcome his compulsion for stealing. At the time of its initial release, back in 1969, Midnight Cowboy received an X-rating, due to its strong suggestive sexual undertones, references to homosexuality, (a HUGE discussion taboo in 1969) and it's disturbing flashback images. In 1971, upon re-release, the MPAA with no edits to the film, changed the rating to ""R."" Although I took into consideration the film's controversial nature in 1969, the film would probably pass for a very strong PG-13 or light R-rating today. However, I was not offended at the film. There might have been one or two flashback scenes that I could see as slightly problematic, but because they are so varied and disjointed in how Joe sees the world, the images may symbolize different things to different people. What I did see was an incredibly complex and involved character study interwoven with stunning cinematography that is as unique as the film itself.My reasons for the score of an 8, instead of a 9 or 10 is that there are a few scenes that drag. But those faults are quickly forgotten, not only with the quality of the camera work, but the wonderful acting chemistry of Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman. They were born to play these memorable roles! The powerful music score, ""Everybody's Talking,"" the haunting note sequence that plays at critical moments of the movie, and an unforgettable emotional ending prove that Midnight Cowboy has aged well! This is a very good movie!",Midnight Cowboy

WestSide Story had dealt with Racism by a love feast in an artistic view. Now, Midnight Cowboy deals with rural exodus by a friendship tragedy in a psychological view. It has a deeply grievous ending that we witness one of the two companions of fate passing away.Director John Schlesinger skillfully deliver us the deepest secret thoughts, dreams, fantasies, fears and evaluations of two New York City scums. While the handsome Joe Buck(Voight) dreams of all the beautiful women of the world begging him to share a wild love fantasy, the poor Ratso Rizzo(Hoffman) dreams of a better and healthier life in clean and sunny Florida. Accordingly, Joe becomes a hustler to turn his fantasies into reality; and Ratso becomes a snatcher to collect enough money to migrate into Florida. Besides Ratso helps Joe to find his way to do whatever he can. They begin sharing everything in life. They share food, they share medicine, they share an uninhabited home, they share their earnings and thus they share a destiny. Regrettably as the story progresses, Joe realizes that being handsome is not the only thing to make all the beautiful women begging him to have fun; and moreover Ratso cannot see Florida since his heart fails defeated to his disease whilst he was on the bus taking him there.The Might is always right, and the Feeble has no right in the daylight. Thence, ""Midnight"" gives the factual sight.Despite the tragedy, there is no melodrama in Midnight Cowboy. Every aspect of each character is the reality of the poor who bear their inevitable fate. Thanks to this, Midnight Cowboy is a provocative view of a socio-political issue, the rural exodus.",Midnight Cowboy

His comment to me was ""I don't get it. Why didn't they just get jobs?"" I was flabbergasted by this comment. He obviously didn't get the whole point of the film. The characters couldn't get regular jobs because it would destroy their dreams, even though the inhumanity of the city was doing that anyway.The plot is that Joe Buck (Voigt), a young man from Texas, decides to move to New York to become a male gigolo for the rich widows and wives in Manhattan. Joe meets a number of set backs and is swindled by crippled conman Ratso Rizzo (Hoffman). Eventually when Joe is on the down and out, he and Ratso form an unlikely partnership to try and make money so they can get to Florida.The movie takes on themes of friendship, desperation, rejection, and ultimately loneliness. It has the distinction of being the only movie rated X to ever win the Best Picture Award at the Academy Awards. The film was fantastic and never seemed to loose sight of its portrayal of the death of dreams for two struggling men.",Midnight Cowboy
151,Det_McNulty,"Few Films Can Match The Level Of Astonishing Narrative, The Visual Perfection and The Achingly Beautiful Key Performances",9,11 January 2007,"When Midnight Cowboy was first released it was an X-rated film (now rated R) which was not expected to appeal to the mass audiences, nor the critics because of its open nature. Yet, it was a huge success and managed to even grab three Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director. Not only does Midnight Cowboy remain iconic, but it also remains a fascinating and hugely influential portrayal of a sadly misguided life. The prime reason for Midnight Cowboy attracting the attention it did was probably from the wonderful casting of Dustin Hoffman as the renowned Ratso Rizzo, who after The Graduate had become a big name in the film industry.Midnight Cowboy follows the story of a young, kind, naive and lonesome man named Joe Buck (Jon Voight) who is seeking a life that will enable him wealth. So he abandons his back-country life and treks to New York in search of glory. He thinks he has everything planned out and upon arriving in the vast city his plan to be a hustler goes array and he finds himself in poverty with the most unlikely of companions Ratso Rizzo. Joe Buck realises that many things have being missing from his life, he soon is opened up to the harsh reality of life and what he needs to come to terms with.Midnight Cowboy is a fascinating story, brimming with the countless, memorable occurrences showing the spiralling downfall of a life that was destined to end in sadness. The film is endlessly captivating through its use of entertainment, hysterical encounters, powerful acting, emotive narrative and the depiction of a gritty urban underclass. Midnight Cowboy is a film with so much to offer its viewers and remains a masterpiece in cinematic perfection. Few American films have remained such a giant counterpart in cinema, yet Midnight Cowboy hails brilliance and echoes flawlessness.The acting from Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman is some of the greatest you're ever going to see. The chemistry and friendship that is shown between Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman is astoundingly tremendous. Both roles have gone down in cinematic history for being two of the finest and most hauntingly poignant roles to have ever been filmed. The characters are perfect and so is the casting. It's never difficult to understand the characters' emotions, their way of getting around their problems and how the deal with a life. They're easily two of the greatest actors at the pinnacle of their incredible careers. Few performances have managed to captivate so many generations of film lovers and still provoke audiences today. The mixture of comedy, fierce anger at society and sexual confusion help to make them such meaningful and deep characters. The script is truly outstanding and works fantastically with the actors who manage to make the lines instantly quotable and motivating.The extraordinary cinematic devices that are littered throughout the film are just another one of the elements that beg you become involved in such a profound illustration of cinematic perfection. The glorious editing is taken to the notch and runs smoothly alongside the film; the beautiful cinematography is natural art that contrasts with the gritty and bitter lifestyles of the main protagonists. The use of music helps give the added pop-culture element to the film and the light-hearted ""Everybody's Talking'"" helps represent the youthful surroundings turned to lost innocence. Midnight Cowboy studies the idea of identity. The homosexual theme that runs through the film is hinted on, yet it never really gets forced towards you and it's up for you to decide if it was just a bond of friendship between the two characters.Enhanced with the stunning array of film-making glory, tremendous story-telling techniques, punched through a flawless script and some of the most tremendous acting you're ever going to see. Midnight Cowboy remains perfection in art and one of truly great American pictures. It has to be seen to be believed, a film of true force.",Midnight Cowboy

The first viewing I was sort of hypnotized by the characters and their plight, and of course the bittersweet ending. The second viewing was just as spell-binding but in a different way. The second time around I could better take it in without being surprised by all that came by me on the screen. It is one of my favorite movies of all time.The ending is very sad and very sweet. The cinematic journey to get to that ending is what makes the film a gem. The performances of both Voight and Hoffman are outstanding. I challenge anyone to find a film that contains two performances any better, any richer in the same movie. There were several ground-breaking films in the late 60s; 2001: A Space Odyssey and Easy Rider to name two. Midnight Cowboy is one more.",Midnight Cowboy

I did expect it to be classy piece of cinema but found it a more raw and freelance film in the style of say 'Easy Rider' so it took a while to get used to the strange cutting, shots and flashbacks. Jon Voight is Joe Buck who gets the Greyhound bus to New York where he intends to make lots of money becoming rich womens play thing. Joe Buck is good looking, a cowboy stallion and a hard spirit to crush, he is full of freedom and enthusiasm but what he finds in New York is not what he expected. It is sad to watch this guys pride and spirit wither away and as he begins to lose money, he drifts into the seedy underworld of the New York streets to make ends meet. This is where he finds Dustin Hoffmans character Rizzo. Together they find a strange friendship dependent on each other to get by and start to look out for each other. I found it quite a sad film, strange and it stayed with me for a few days after. I like films that do this. What did it mean? I don't really know but I have watched it again since and found it equally enthralling. I can't put my finger on what makes this a great film, it just is - Voight and Hoffman are great in their roles and its hard to find many films like it. I wouldn't recommend it to everyone but anyone who is a film lover its a must see.",Midnight Cowboy

Not a rich and beautiful socialite but a bible thumper, JOhn McGiver, who wants to save the young Texan's soul. no more give-aways.sounds interesting...but let's get real....if Hoffman is that hip to the streets he would know how to ""work the system"" to live a lot better than in an abandoned building. if Voight is that tall and good looking and strong, why can't he get a job n a warehouse? is he that freaking dumb? the economy was ghood in 1969. all right, whatever.buy this DVD as a period piece and a very compelling but totally implausible drama. you know the soundtrack music.",Midnight Cowboy

It is mentioned in so many reviews I read as well as in interviews with directors and actors. It was released with an ""X"" rating which is laughable by our standards today. I think you see one female breast in about three short, clothed sex scenes. It later received an R rating.This film is old, it came out the same year I was born.Oldies are often goodies though and ""Midnight Cowboy,"" while gritty, is a drama treat with award winning actors that make the story come alive.I love movies that show us the naked city. From the playbills stapled and frayed on side streets to the honking of taxicabs. People are trying to survive and we get to travel with the camera, taking it all in. Of course, we can pause at any time or come back to revisit another time. People in the real city can't. Maybe that's why we like watching what they will do, often out of desperation.Just seeing John Voight and Dustin Hoffman in their prime is very entertaining.These guys were showing us acting like university drama instructors here in their mid twenties. John Voight has always struck me as one dimensional and stupid. That actually works for his character here. Hoffman is a con man, a sick one at that. We get a slice of 1969 in this very well made and incredibly acted film.

158,gbrumburgh,"Bleak, bruising, brilliant character study -- with New York City never more dark or depressing.",10,23 April 2001,"The vivid dreams of a naive but ambitious country boy are quickly dashed by the cold, cruel realities of big city living in ""Midnight Cowboy,"" director John Schlesinger's gritty, lacerating study of two disparate creatures who initially clash, then inexorably bond out of necessity.Strapping, fair-haired Joe Buck is a simple, sensitive, extremely handsome Texas hick going nowhere fast in a nowhere town.  Reduced to dishwashing jobs and with no viable goals or training that will likely steer him away from the pots and pans any time soon, the plucky dude finds himself swayed enough by magazines and posters to leave his hell hole of an existence and shoot for much bigger dreams.  The narcissistic Joe actually fancies himself a ladies' man and aims to pleasure the rich city women with very costly stud services that will take him to the top of his trade, eventually retiring to his dream spot -- Florida.Within a very short time of arriving in NYC, things go woefully wrong.  The con man becomes the conned as he quickly falls prey to other more streetwise characters, duped even by his own tricks.   As money and hope run low and fear and despair fear set in, Joe crosses paths with a slimy little street mole named Ratso Rizzo, an ailing, crippled loser who also scammed him at one point.  Dire circumstances eventually draw the two misfits together as they begin to rely on one another for companionship and survival. Eventually, the homeless, destitute pair are forced into petty thievery, pimping, and even worse.Soulful-eyed Jon Voight became a star with this picture, and Joe Buck remains THE role of his enviable career despite a number of sensational performances that followed.  His subtle but startling transition from  cocky upstart to grim, terrified street hustler is piteous and achingly real. And it all registers so beautifully on that angelic, good-looking mug of his. In fact, the moment Joe gets off the bus in the middle of hustling, bustling New York, decked out in his absurd ""stud"" gear, you find yourself begging him to get back on the bus, go back home, pick up the dishrag, and think again.  Joe's wild, garish-looking western outfit, complete with Stetson, spit-polished boots and Texas drawl, looks about as out of place as a polar bear in the Sahara Desert.Dustin Hoffman, one of Hollywood's greatest character stars, immerses himself completely into the pathetic role of Ratso, almost unrecognizable both in appearance and mannerisms.  The relationship the two are destined to forge becomes one of the oddest, most fascinating  pairings since George and Lenny in ""Of Mice and Men.""  Hoffman and Voight are both so superb they probably knocked the Oscar trophy right out of each other's hands, allowing a sentimental win for John Wayne.Surrounding this powerhouse duo are a number of smaller but highly potent cameos that underscore NYC's seamy underbelly, including Brenda Vaccaro as a casual but promising encounter, Sylvia Miles as a gaudy matron who knows how to turn the tables on her tricks, and Bob Balaban and Bernard Hughes as last resort ""customers"".  Ruth White and Jennifer Salt add some effective moments in flashback as Joe's mother and girlfriend, allowing the audience insight into our protagonist's background and stability.      1969's ""Midnight Cowboy"" was the first ""X""-rated picture ever to land an Oscar.  It may seem tame now by today's rating scale, but, all that aside, this movie will hold its own as one of Hollywood's most compelling character studies for decades to come.You owe it to yourself to see what brilliant film-making is all about.",Midnight Cowboy
159,varundelpiero,Effectively solid...,8,26 January 2009,"John Schlesinger's Best Picture winner is where great acting by two (then) up-and-coming actors meets a solid and ultimately emotional script with great cinematography and a decent soundtrack. Perhaps not the best film to pick up the Best Picture, Best Director and Best Screenplay treble, but it is effective and solid.It is difficult to summarise MIDNIGHT COWBOY's implications in a single short review/comment as it touches on a vast array of emotions, thanks in part to excellent use of flashback scenes and daydream scenes, which reveal unspoken elements of the main characters.Best Actor nods for Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight were well-deserved, as was the nod for Sylvia Miles for Best Supporting Actress.MIDNIGHT COWBOY may not be described as a superbly great movie, and is perhaps not one for the ages, nor is it an epic. But as mentioned, it is solid and effective. 3.5 stars (out of 4). 8/10. Will enter my Top 250 at 244. Highly recommended, even if it's just because it is a Best Picture.",Midnight Cowboy
160,dj_xand325,113 minutes of deeply excellent cinema,8,13 July 2008,"Midnight Cowboy - First X rated film to win a Best Picture OscarMidnight Cowboy follows the rocky story of Joe Buck (Jon Voight) trying to live a life in the dark and gloomy New York of the late 60's. On the way he finds a friend ratzo (Dustin Hoffman) who takes him into his severely grotty apartment where they act as a team to survive.An underlying theme i noticed in the film is naivety. Joe comes to New York from the rural area of Texas where you can talk to anyone and the atmosphere is less hustle and bustle!. When he arrives at New York he becomes dislocated and lost, this contributes mostly to the vastly depressing nature of the film. It also present a small message in the difference between rural and urban areas.The film was rated X and i can see why!. This is mostly due to the predominant theme of male prostitution and constant sexual situations. Of course any hint towards these controversial themes would be an automatic X rating, similar to Kubrick's Lolita made 7 years earlier that was rated X due to the theme of paedophilia. However, at present day the film gets away with a comfortable 18 rating.Technically this was an exceptional film. The cinematography and editing were undoubtedly brilliant. There are numerous psychedelic sequences which are executed perfectly. These sequences also added to the originality of this already very original movie. Surprisingly it lost out on the best editing Oscar.As for the performances, Hoffman was as always perfect as his role of the sleazy character that is Ratzo. Voight was also brilliant but in my eyes wasn't as great as Hoffman. Despite this, they were a great pair on screen that carried the film. I feel that that either one of them had a big chance to win the best actor Oscar but it went to John Wayne in 'True Grit', I haven't seen the film so i cant comment.This film is both controversial and excellent, a great combination.9/10",Midnight Cowboy

Yes, it got an X rating (which just goes to show that even back in the early days, the MPAA Ratings Board was out of touch) but it's relatively tame by todays standards of sex, violence and profanity. It probably got such a rating from it's dark, somber tone which gets under your skin and sticks with you. If so, that's quite a tribute. And yet, the film is not without it's heartwarming moments.

He shines in a role that he made his own. In the mix is Jon Voight (also on top form) as Joe Buck a Texas stud going to New York to appease the sexual frustrations of all the New York women. Obviously his plan is a little weak, and he gets there to find out he has no idea how to live in such a chaotic place. With the help of Ratso though, he might just survive. Although at first he neglects and insults Ratso tenfold. It seems that their brooding friendship may be the only thing keeping them alive in the harsh city. But as winter comes, Ratso gets ill, and with Joe almost finding his business as gigolo up and running, it's time to make a statement of what he finds more important. His friendship, or his livelihood. The ending is heartbreaking... But I won't spoil any more. This film is a brilliant accompaniment of harrowing themes, and supreme direction. Maybe a little underrated, but it is sure that this film is a living testimony to how important friendship is.",Midnight Cowboy

165,paul_johnr,The cowboy without a horse,9,10 July 2006,"Acidic, unremitting, and beautiful, John Schlesinger's masterpiece is no less effective today than 35 years ago, when American life was even more disorienting. The film probably could not have been made at any other time in history, because so many upheavals were taking place in the late 1960s: final dissolution of the Great American West, the intensification of war in Vietnam, and the clash of social ideals that were bewildering in variety.'Midnight Cowboy' is widely known as the only Academy Award-winning film to garner an 'X' rating, but there is much more behind its fame; it also exceeds the norm as a work of art. While this film (from the novel by James Leo Herlihy) has much to say about the erosion of American life, it transcends '60s politics by looking into the hidden bonds of friendship and dealing with themes familiar to man in all eras. The two main characters, in fact, are standard antiheroes - men who have nothing grand to offer but plenty to vent about our world.The initial focus of 'Midnight Cowboy' is on 28-year-old Joe Buck, a physically imposing Texas native played by Jon Voight. In the opening scenes, we follow Joe's bus trip to New York City, where he plans on using one of his few genuine talents - the ability to pleasure women - and earn his fortune as a hustler. We learn upon his arrival that Joe is laughably naïve in the sex trade. Garbed in cowboy duds and proclaiming himself as 'one hell of a stud,' the young Texan flounders through his early tricks before partnering with Enrico 'Ratso' Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman), a sickly con man and petty thief from the Bronx. Ratso, who is short, thin, and with a limp, proves of little monetary help to Joe. They quickly run out of cash and as life grows severe in the winter months, Joe and Ratso shiver in a condemned Manhattan apartment building with hardly a dollar or square meal to their names. It is over this period that a strong friendship develops between them, the two men relying on each other to battle tremendous odds.Throughout the film, Joe hearkens back to earlier years in Texas, including life with his grandmother Sally (Ruth White), who served as guardian; his harried relationship with 'Crazy' Annie (Jennifer Salt), a notorious local girl; and a traumatic event in which Joe and Annie were assaulted by town folk who wanted to break up the love affair. Very much of its time, 'Midnight Cowboy' strings together a wild array of flashbacks, dream sequences, and psychedelic imagery that shed light on the main characters while also distorting their backgrounds. For every moment of understanding we gain from Joe and Ratso, more questions about their lives are generated. Both men are no doubt in tatters; they have no clear sense of direction until Ratso falls into the throes of illness and Joe finally senses a purpose for being alive. This revelation pushes 'Midnight Cowboy' to its conclusion, a rather hopeful one in a very grim story.While Joe and Ratso badly need some luck, the direction of John Schlesinger is clearly outlined and uses the gritty atmosphere of Waldo Salt's screenplay in allowing Voight and Hoffman to thrive. Their interactions look extremely natural and the supporting cast, which features Sylvia Miles, Brenda Vaccaro, and members of the Andy Warhol clique, offers itself as an essential part of the storyline. The flashback sequences involving Voight, Ruth White, and Jennifer Salt are particularly impressive in dealing with the heartbreak of time lost.Any young person wondering about the psychedelic era is advised to watch this film, thanks to the excellent cinematography of Adam Holender ('The Boy Who Could Fly,' 'Smoke') and editing by Hugh Robertson ('Shaft'). The visuals of 'Midnight Cowboy' work with its soundtrack (assembled by John Barry) as a cohesive unit, sometimes foreseeing music videos of the past two decades. The lead song Everybody's Talking is sung by Nilsson, which was actually used as a temporary track during the editing phase. The memorable harmonica theme is played by Jean 'Toots' Thielemans.'Midnight Cowboy' has been released in a two-disc collector's edition by MGM/UA, which contains expanded features and commentary. Also available is a 1998 DVD release (used for this review), which offers dual widescreen and standard format with 5.1 Dolby Digital sound enhancement; three-language subtitles and closed captioning; French 'dubbing'; a theatrical re-release trailer (not the 'original' as advertised); and an eight-page production booklet. Both DVD editions contain a 25th anniversary restored version of the film, showing its original brilliance. Well-deserving of its three Oscars (best picture, Schlesinger, Waldo Salt) and additional nominations (Voight, Hoffman, Sylvia Miles, Hugh Robertson), 'Midnight Cowboy' will be sure to hold its place on the list of immortal classics.*** ½ out of 4",Midnight Cowboy

This is unlike anything: flashbacks, flash-forwards, fantasies, reality, psychodelia, and underneath all of it is a very sentimental unpretentious touching tale of people needing each other. This is not an easy one to describe and even tougher to recommend. If you prefer movies that don't do all the work for you, this is the one. You can't watch Midnight Cowboy casually.

I popped the tape in the VCR and proceeded to waste 2+ hours of my time on this piece of crap. Yes, Hoffman and Voight give good performances, but there's one thing sadly lacking: we really don't care for these people, much less what happens to them. Even Pulp Fiction, which dealt with the same sort of scumballs and lowlifes, succeeded in making you care, and thanks to the Gump machine, It couldn't win Best Picture!

But understanding that this was the 1960s and ""everyone was doing it"" does go part way to offsetting the sometimes excessive, gratuitous nudity and many graphic sex scenes.A significant part of the appeal of this movie HAS to be dedicated to the sound track. Absolutely expertly chosen, it is not only timeless, but many years after its release, it transports you back to a time - in my case - long before I was even born; quite remarkable.Worth watching at least 2 or 3 times to soak up all the many, many details you'll miss in the first viewing!",Midnight Cowboy

Two lonely souls in a cold city among with hookers, criminals, homeless and undeliverable dreams of being someone and grab the one and only chance to make money.

176,garage5inc,Excellent,9,12 January 2003,"Midnight Cowboy was a very well made movie, however I couldn't help but to feel at the end a little let down. The ending had little impact, and this is a bad thing because it was supose to be one of the most dramatic endings a movie can get. Some people can easily relate to Ratso Rizzo or Joe Buck. Take the worst sickness you've ever caught, multiply it by five, and make it a chronic disorder with a crippled muscle or broken bone, and you've got Rizzo.

Joe Buck is the ambitious guy who shows up at a party, but doesn't know anybody, and has a hard time striking up something.
This movie was a good film about friendship at the lowest level of society, you can learn a great deal from this movie. It also reminds us of how hopeless life can get, and just when you think you're back on track, you get U-Turned right back where you don't want to be. 9/10",Midnight Cowboy
177,sixtwentysix,Shattered Dreams and Survival in the City,10,24 April 2004,"`You know what you've got to do cowboy' -JoeA sad but very captivating snapshot of misguided broken dreams and survival in a big city. The happy-go-lucky Joe Buck comes to the city in hopes of becoming an easy money stud for hire. The past of Joe is hazy and jaded shown through flashbacks, thus adding to his bizarre mystique. Friendly and trusting he soon learns the hard way that life in New York is a rough existence without real income or friends.After befriending survivor Rico Rizzo a gimp conman with dreams of going somewhere warm and sunny, they struggle simply to stay alive one day at a time. Dustin Hoffman gives one of the performances that built his career, one I'm sure I'll never forget as long as I live. John Voight provides a rock solid performance as the 'cowboy'. His character Buck exudes a sleazy naive charm that is captivating from the opening scene.Easy to understand but never dumbed down this film rides the razors edge of perfection and pretension. It's a heartbreaking tale of friendship, survival and shattered dreams of two lost souls struggling desperately to keep their heads above water. While things are implied that are at times extremely dark, this film allows you to identify with the characters and for a short time and even live and die with their smalltime hopes.
The only film to date that was originally rated X to win the Academy award this film (and I cannot stress this enough) needs to be watched unedited and not on television. Strange, sleazy, heartbreaking and even at times heartwarming this film is an achievement not to be missed.",Midnight Cowboy
178,connorbbalboa,"""Not bad, not bad...for a cowboy.""",10,3 March 2016,"One of the most touching films ever made and a perfect example of 70s style film-making. But this is not just a film for the 60s or 70s. It is filled with themes such as lower-class vs upper-class people, struggles in getting a job, genuine friendship, and ultimate pessimism. Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are both excellent as the male hooker and his eventual best friend. Voight's Joe Buck (classic name) starts off not liking Hoffman's Enrico ""Ratso"" Rizzo, but they ultimately are the only people that they each can count on in a city where the rich people don't give a damn about the people below their ""level"" and without the proper skills and know-how, it's hard to get a job that doesn't involve anything illegal. Probably the most heart- breaking story on film that could involve a hustler who wants to do the dirty deed for money and a sickly conman who double-crosses the hustler first, only to love that same hustler as a friend.",Midnight Cowboy
179,FrankNSteinSinatra,Want more? - read the book,10,28 November 2019,"In the film we are told mainly about Joe Buck's struggles in New York, except the short farewell scene from the Texan little town and the bus ride to Manhattan in the beginning. On the other hand, the book is divided in two: the cowboy´s childhood and his growing up to be a hustler. In the movie the first part is shown only in flashbacks, that are however well agglomerated to the cinematographic needs.
After reading the book some questions raised: how the writer James Leo Herlihy invented and composed the whole story? Are there biographical elements, because the writer was a kind of drifter and gay himself?",Midnight Cowboy
180,vhilden,We go through our lives dreaming,8,20 September 2000,"We are old when we feel our dreams won't turn real. For Joe Buck, raised in Texas, the dream was New York. For Rizzo/Rico/Ratso, raised in New York, the dream was Florida. I don't know, because I've never been in the gutter like this film's main characters, but perhaps life is like that -- you can never truly reach what you fight for. Depressing. One curious thing, our society hasn't changed very much in the last 30 years. Cars evolved from ashtrays to salad bowls, and we don't see women wearing pink dresses anymore, but the social situations in Midnight Cowboy aren't much different now from 1969. And Alanis Morrissette could have sung all the songs. Brenda Vaccaro was a cute, 30 years old woman, and she is now a respectable 60 years old lady. Jon Voight played the part of a young stud, today he plays the part of president Franklin Roosevelt. His daughter, Angelina Jolie, was born six years after ""Midnight Cowboy"" was made, etc, but the film doesn't ""feel"" old.Surely, the difference between 1969 and 2000 is much less than the difference between 1899 and 1930, for instance. We have computers that are a million times more powerful, but they could create credible ""psychedelic"" images in the 1960's by simply projecting images through a bubbling liquid. Compare the party scenes in ""Midnight Cowboy"" to those in the 1998 film ""Blade"", with Wesley Snipes. Am I cheating, comparing a ""true classic"" with a horror film? Well, the technique is the same, flashing scenes used to conjure feelings, the same as deejays' strobo lights. I've been waiting all my life for a music style that will surpass Rock'n'Roll, but there's nothing new in the social scene since the mid 1960's.""Midnight Cowboy"" may not be so revolutionary anymore, but it's still a great film.",Midnight Cowboy
181,Diego_rjc,The first and only X-rated movie ever to win an Oscar,9,2 March 2010,"The MPAA (Motion picture Association of America) was created in 1922 in order to regulate movie making in the United States by all the six major studios. In 1930, they created the Hayes Code, used to tell what could and couldn't be in a movie. The Code was used for 38 years, until 1968, when it was replaced by the rating system used even today by the MPAA. And when the rating system started, the worst rate a movie could get was and still is the X rating, used in most cases only for Adult movies. But even with a X rating, the 1969 John Schlesinger's movie 'Midnight Cowboy' was able to win 3 Oscars, including best picture, being the only X-rated movie ever to win an Oscar with such a rating. This proves how good and powerful this movie is, and how it shocked the late-1960's society.'Midnight Cowboy' tells the story of Joe Buck (John Voight), a Texas greenhorn that, bored with his life in the countryside, decides to move to New York and work as a hustler. But he finds out that life in New York isn't as easy as he thought, until he teams up with a city bum, named Ratzo Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman). Together, they struggle to survive in the city's hard life, while they become even more good friends. The movie's screenplay is based on a novel by James Leo Herlihy. I haven't read the book in which the movie is based on, but I can say Waldo Salt did a incredible job adapting the Oscar-winning movie's screenplay. There isn't one bit missing, and the movie flows in a incredible way. It doesn't lose its pace in one single moment, and the story here couldn't be better. Throughout these two iconic and unforgettable characters, the movie develops themes like homosexuality, drugs, the life in the city for those who have nothing, prejudice, etc. These themes are all incredibly presented, in a subtle but very ferocious way, reaching out for the very soul of the American society.The acting here couldn't be any better and this movie couldn't be more well-casted. I dare to say it's one of the best overall acting ever, along with movies like 'Kramer vs. Kramer' or 'A Streetcar Named Desire'. The whole cast does a perfect job, even with small parts. The Oscar-nominated performance by Sylvia Miles as Cass, one of Joe's clients is excellent. The rest of the supporting cast do an equally incredible job, especially Brenda Vaccaro as Shirley, other Joe's client. Aside from the not so-famous but excellent supporting cast, we have in the main roles two major stars, in probably the best performances of both's career - John Voight and Dustin Hoffman. They were both Oscar-nominated for their roles as Joe Buck and Ratso Rizzo respectively, and they both lost to John Wayne for his role in 'True Grit'. John Wayne was good, indeed, but his performance wasn't even the half of the job Hoffman and Voight did. This is certainly one of the biggest injustices in Oscar's history, but more for Dustin Hoffman. Of course Voight was also incredible, doing a naive but at the same time wild interpretation, which is perfect for the character, but Hoffman did what is probably one of the best performances by a male actor in movie's history. There isn't anything I can say to describe his work. Brilliant, absolutely brilliant.And even with this incredibly good screenplay, and one of the best overall acting ever, this movie wouldn't be the same without the Oscar- winning John Schlesinger's directing work. His direction is very experimental, but who wasn't in 1969? Now that the Hayes Code went down, anything was possible, and Schlesinger utilizes this in a incredible manner. He uses a few long, gentle shots, and others more vivid, with a fast editing when the character was stoned or in his dreams, for example. The use of flashbacks here is also great, as we follow the past events only in Joe's mind, so we don't really find out what happened in Texas with his ex-girlfriend, a quite important subject for the movie's story. Throughout the film, we hear a lot of the original song made for the movie by Fred Neil, called ""Everybody's Talking'"". While the music is great, in a very nice folk style, its constant use bothers you after a while. The cinematography here also bothered me a little bit, the movie could have a darker treatment.Overral, 'Midnight Cowboy' is an almost perfect piece of cinema. The winner of the best picture Oscar in 1969, and the only X-rated movie to accomplish this, has a perfect screenplay, with unforgettable characters and dialogs, excellent lines, and a very nice pace. It also features one of the best acting work ever, specially with Dustin Hoffman, in the best work of his career. John Schlesinger is equally great, making this movie a must-see for anyone.9/10",Midnight Cowboy
182,bock_g,Simply told in the most radical form of art.,9,18 September 2012,"""Midnight Cowboy"" is a simple American film like no other, it's a coming of age story as well as the disillusionment of the reoccurring American Dream. Despite the seemingly generic plot, this is also visual collage of a much more dark and grim New York in the late 1960's filmed from the perspective of an English filmmaker, John Schlesinger. The film's charm comes from the two main characters Joe Buck and ""Ratzo"" Rizzo (portrayed by Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman respectively). Joe Buck is a wannabe gigolo from Texas who comes to New York to satisfy rich women for a permanent living. Being the really naive and ""square"" guy, Joe's attempts fail as he ends up losing all his fortune and hooking up with male customers at 42nd street out of desperation. In the middle of those events, Joe meets Ratzo Rizzo, a third-rate con man with a gimpy leg. Ratzo initially cons Joe but the two eventually strike a close relationship that lasts until the end of the film. These characters are so real and well-portrayed by Voight and Hoffman. Their chemistry and exchange of dialogue is just so fun to watch. I hear people debating over whether the relationship between these two characters are Homosexual, but I really think that's beside the point. Intimate relationships are not necessarily sexual, which is what Schlesinger is trying to point out. The film also makes brilliant use of fast-cutting flashbacks which became somewhat of a trademark in the early era of New- Hollywood. The Warhol-esque party sequence is also one of the few sequences in the film that uses radical visuals of the late 1960's. Aside from the technological trademarks that make this film good, it as also the first and only X-rated film to win the Best Picture Oscar. However, I see the film as something more important which is the motif of an intimate relationship that definitely withstands the test of time.",Midnight Cowboy
183,Adrian-32,An American Masterpiece,10,1 April 1999,"""Midnight Cowboy"" is absolutely brilliant. A brutally honest look into the lives of a naive hustler and an ailing con-man while they wander through the corrupt streets of New York City, holding bright dreams but facing harsh realities.

184,Adrian-32,A brilliant film,10,7 April 1999,"Is it possible to thoroughly enjoy and love a film, even though its story is so disturbing and tragic and the the main characters don`t achieve any happiness but only heartbreak? Of course. ""Midnight Cowboy"" is perfect film to fit that description. It is no ordinary film, instead it is a unforgettable journey through the eyes of two drifters who slowly witness their lives plummeting deeper into a decadent world of drugs, sex and hopelessness. It is such a rarity for a film to provoke such intense emotions and thoughts like this film does, it leaves a sharp impact. ""Midnight Cowboy"" explores the bleaker side of life, and how cruel the world can be to people just trying to achieve their dreams. Jon Voight gives a remarkable performances as one of drifters, Joe Buck, a naive Texan native who dreams of becoming a hustler. Dustin Hoffman is equally as brilliant portraying the sleazy but dying con man, Ratso Rizzo. ""Midnight Cowboy"" is not a film that shies away from the brutal reality, instead, it displays the corrupt urban jungle at its grimmest, as it robs the two lead characters of money, dignity and ultimately hope. But amidst the depressing tale lies a unusual but profound coming-of-age story between Joe and Ratso. ""Midnight Cowboy"" shows the signifigance of a shared bond, especially through such painful cirumstances. You can call it the American Dream gone sadly wrong, Joe and Ratso`s journey comes to a tragic halt at the end of the film. ""Midnight Cowboy""`s final scene is the most heart-breaking moment I`ve ever seen in a film. It will surely leave an impact on you forever.",Midnight Cowboy
185,amanbirsingh,Midnight Cowboy,9,18 September 2021,"Midnight Cowboy brings the country dream and modern solitude together into a tragic tale of friendship. It introduces an eligible hand in the form of a young and vicious Jon Voight who plays Lou, someone who does not over-react to New York when he meets it and does not present a self-righteous front moreover. His counterpart is a half-beat Puerto Rican named Rico/Rizzo played by Dustin Hoffman who hates being called Ratso by the locals for the most obvious of reasons.The film starts the protagonist off and drives forward energetically and crudely. It has a serious script and the cheap dialogue is effective. There are scenes of intensity in plenty and helped by the simplest of music. The screenplay is able to produce spontaneity between the characters when they are shown to be deficient. The special form of lighting used mainly for the purpose of focus is new and welcome. There are numerous zoom-in sequences and difficult shot angles captured as experiments. Overall it shows signs of maturity and experience by the team when employing such a wide range of methods.The film works to settle the characters in and capture the culture of a menial existence as the city defeats itself every day. It makes a small world in a big place. All Rizzo has to say when invited to a party is 'I ain't dressed for the party', as he mumbles his reply.Hoffmann delivers a personal show and Voight gives it his every ounce as both actors go about constructing their painful relationship.

186,dimitrisalomao,Great.,8,11 March 2010,"""Midnight Cowboy"" is a movie that is not all good, but when it ends you feel like it really touched you, because the movie basically builds up to its ending, but the problem is that it looks like it don't care that much about it's middle.Although Voight's performance sometimes may seem a little bit too dumb, it's charismatic, and yes, good. But what really stands out is Hoffman's one, he makes his character so interesting, sometimes strong, and sometimes very emotional (look at the cemetery scene for example), and you never know if he really likes that dumb cowboy, or if he is trying to use him to get ""mony"".There was some scenes in the movie that I really thought were boring, like the scene of wild sex between Cass and Buck, but there are also very powerful scenes, like the one with Buck and the gay teenager, that shows how desperate Buck is to get money, and you see how uncomfortable he is for doing that.Some scenes really disturbs you, like the scenes of the cooking with those dirty pots, you see how decadently some people live, and sometimes you feel bad for having so much. The last (and most powerful scenes) really touches you, the image of that tall dumb cowboy hugging his dead friend and controlling his tears although we can see in his eyes that he's suffering, is one of the most powerful scenes you'll ever see.Verdict: Although sometimes it may seem boring, it's totally worth seeing for it's great performances, and touching ending, don't miss this one!.",Midnight Cowboy

By today's standards, it would be hard pressed to pull an R rating. Jon Voight, who has been better, is competent in his role as Joe Buck, an out of town hick wanting to make it big with the ladies in New York City. He meets a seedy street hustler named Ratso Rizzo, who tries to befriend Buck for his own purposes. The two eventually forge a bond that is both touching and pathetic. As Ratso, Dustin Hoffman simply shines. Hoffman has often been brilliant, but never more so than in this portrayal. He is so into character that all else around him pales in comparison. Losing the Academy Award to John Wayne is one of the most ridiculous decisions ever made by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences.

Hoffman and Voight make the most of dream roles, while the cinematography is a standout, this time with a Pole behind the New Wave camera not the ubiquitous Hungarians. Small on action but big on emotion, it never falls into sentimentality, its bold exploration of social themes in strong contrast to the limp conservatism of modern American cinema.Can you imagine what Hollywood would do to this today? ""We love your work John, but we're going to have to reshoot the ending. It didn't rate with the test audience. Too depressing, and can we throw in some action, liven it up a bit.""Midnight Cowboy was made for $3m, around $20m today, still a fraction of modern budgets, which goes to show that more doesn't mean better.

I was born in 1969 when Midnight Cowboy was made. It contains a timeless quality, as if the movie could have been made today. I always consider this to be the hallmark of a great movie. I enjoyed watching Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman in one of their earliest works. Most of this movie took me to down deep into a depressed state. Then at the end it brings me back up. I rooted for Voight's character to finally make a choice good for him. The constant flashbacks to his childhood were effective. The little boy reminded me of my five year old son for some strange reason. Maybe this is why I rooted for Voight. I could not stand Hoffman's character Ratzo Rizzo when I first see him but then a strange thing happened, as I got to know him better I fell in love with the character. His facial expressions when he suffered, again a weird personal twist for me, reminded me of my eight-year-old daughter. At the end I teared up when Rizzo died. I enjoyed the performances by Brenda Vaccarro and the blonde, married woman. I forgot her name. Both were sexually appealing and fun.

I wish such original work were still attempted today.Voight (as Joe Buck) and Hoffman (as Rizzo) rightly received Oscar Nominations for outstanding performances in their lead roles, while Schlesinger, Hellman and Salt scooped Oscars for direction, production and screenplay.Here, writer and director have decided to take a good, long look at the underbelly of American urban-life, the gritty realities of surviving in a tough city, and the flawed nature of the characters that inhabit it. This is the jaded world of the late 60s. The party was almost over...A ""faux"" cowboy fresh in from Hicksville and streetwise hustler form an unlikely, but powerful symbiotic relationship, that develops and strengthens as the film unfolds. Both men mirror each other in subtle ways. Both have flawed, dysfunctional backgrounds beautifully observed and narrated by Schlesinger.New York's Underground, especially it's Art-house Film Movement, is debunked here, as Schlesinger makes a jarring contrast between self-indulgent New Yorkers and the two central players. Rizzo and Joe, of course, cannot hold the same values, due to their bitter daily struggles.Joe is haunted by his abused past, while Rizzo has lived so long in drafty tenements, he's dying of pneumonia. The only way they can escape these brutal realities, is by holding onto remote dreams of traveling to warmer climes.Since Rizzo never quite makes it, in the end this wonderful film seems to reinforce a worthwhile idea.

If they could just get one lucky break, they would stop doing all the rotten things that they do just to survive.One scene I found that went on way too long was the crazy 60's party scene, although it established the tone for the time and NYC life (although some would probably argue that it's STILL this way).Fantastic movie overall.",Midnight Cowboy

It's arrangement - and indeed the melody itself - are reminiscent of early Bond movies. Which makes sense, as it was composed by John Barry. But what makes it into such a heartbreakingly beautiful song is the inimitable style of harmonica virtuoso Toots Thielemans.There have been greater movie scores, but never a theme song which captured a movie's atmosphere better than this one. Midnight Cowboy tells the story of a country boy who sets out to conquer the big city, only to discover he is no match for his opponent. A theme that has been told before and since, but never as well as in this movie. Sad and funny moments are mixed with just the right amount of irony and realism.

To name some aspects, the cast was done perfectly. Jon Voight owned the role as hustler Joe Buck and there was no one more scuzzier for the role of Enrico ""Ratzo"" Rizzo than Dustin Hoffman. Another superb aspect was the sound mixing, with Harry Nilsson's rendition of ""Everybody's Talking'"" dispersed evenly throughout the opening sequences of the film. The transitions in the film were inventive and clever, directed by John Schlesinger. Midnight Cowboy is an emotional pitfall, leaving the viewer with few, if any, missed points. The missed happiness of the film was drown out by the moral and heartbreaking touch Midnight Cowboy depicts on screen. This film includes a deep complexity, which is unfortunately surpassed by other thoughts about the film (such as its pornographic nature, just as American Psycho, that dampens the genius of the film). Cowboy needs no introduction, nor does it need explanation- it's 1969's ""Cream of the Crop"" and clearly aspires not to be western-based material (1969 already had way too much of that from such releases as True Grit, The Wild Bunch and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid).

203,NineFelines,Very Good Depiction of Memories & Dreams,8,30 April 2012,"The most striking thing about this movie, for me, was the realistic way in which Joe Buck's memories and dreams were conveyed. Small, micro flashbacks interspersed in current events, such as when he was bored on the bus trip to New York and thinking about what he was leaving behind. That is exactly how memories are experienced in everyday life – little snippets of the past spliced and overlaid onto the constant flow of our present time data stream. The movie also was quite realistic with its handling of dreams – choppy and somehow frantic even when not all negative.The way the story was told also was impressive. Joe Buck never talked about the past we saw in his memories and dreams, yet it was depicted clearly enough to grasp not only his reason for leaving Texas, but also his psychological state. The representation of New York City as a crumbling den of all flavors of iniquitous behavior, from the penthouse down to the homeless was possibly a bit heavy handed, but perhaps appropriate for the time. Dustin Hoffman was also excellent as Ratso. The ending, as seen from outside the bus with the reflection of Miami's architecture sliding by provided a poignancy that nudged the movie up to the next level of excellence.",Midnight Cowboy

I suppose the creator of this story was going for offensive, to which they definitely achieved with me. I don't want to give out any details of the film, but it just dealt with different themes that just utterly repulsed me. I'm not even quite sure what I can write about it, because I just disliked it so much. It was too mysterious. Too obscure and non- descriptive. Too cryptic. It just focused on the real, scum of the earth types of people. At least to my standards. The only nice thing was the relationship between the characters Joe and Rizzo. That was kind of sweet in some sort of awful way.I'll give the movie enough credit in that it kept my attention. I was fixated on it, even though I wasn't pleased with it. It was very strange.",Midnight Cowboy
205,gcappadona,Midnight Cowboy Review,8,23 November 2014,"This film was great in its overall meaning. This film was about the growth of these two guy's friendship from the start in New York City all the way till Florida when Ratso (a.k.a Rico). I think it was very ironic that at the very end of the movie when Joe Buck finally is willing to start over when they arrive in Florida and call Ratso Rico he turns to look at Rico and he has passed away. Rico in a way served as a guide for Joe Buck throughout the movie. He attempted to help him get jobs in the city but then it just turned into a learning experience for him when he got to Florida when he said ""There has got to be an easier way to do it, I'm not a hustler, we should just get jobs"".I loved the editing in this movie when it is going back and forth from Joe Bucks current life to his life back when in Texas with that girl. It gives you the back story in a flashback all while telling you the present story. This was great.",Midnight Cowboy
206,a-ferrera,"Excellent movie, and pushing the boundaries.",9,13 December 2011,"This is a great movie, it is extremely raw and disturbing, especially for the time that it was made in. There was no other movie made in this era of film that could compare to the disturbing qualities that are shown in this movie. Jon Voight is so good in his role as a doughy eye handsome airhead who doesn't know much and thinks life as a hustler is an easy one in New York City. It's crazy to see him deal with the harshness of homelessness and poverty on the dirty streets of the city. Then there is Ratso Rizzo, played by Dustin Hoffman who is a scumbag veteran of the harsh streets of New York City and a con artist. His character is so good and believable. It is great to see these two characters interact and both take care of each other throughout the film. I also enjoy that this movie does not end on a happy note like most movies that came out in this era.",Midnight Cowboy
207,uziesuzie,"""Im looking for the statue of liberty""",8,13 April 2013,"Im not a big fan of Jon Voight, but his acting in this film was really good. I don't know if Voight currently picks poor character roles or has lost his touch, cause ""Anaconda"" wasn't cutting it. Dustin Hoffman was Excellent as usual. His nasally voice didn't work for me a first, but i got used to it once i connected it more to his character. It was funny to read that this move was considered X rated at one point in time and then compare that to the excepted violence and nudity in movies today. It was great to see a late 60's movie that dove into realistic aspect of life that where not allowed during the Hays code. There was no tip toeing around touchy issues in this movie.",Midnight Cowboy
208,westersnows,"""The two basic items necessary to sustain life, are sunshine and coconut milk... didya know that?""",9,22 April 2014,"I don't even know what to say about this film. I didn't know what I was expecting when I started watching because of all the hype and I laughed out loud when I found out it was rated X. It seems people categorize this film as one of two things: either a pretentious movie that's only good for its shock value (at the time, New Hollywood etc.) OR an incredibly sad ""realistic"" fact- of- life type of drama. Naturally, I disagree with both. I think the people that are interpreting it as some moralistic, deep and depressing film are missing the point. Now this may be insensitive (I know you're supposed to care about the characters and put yourself in their position etc.) but I honestly think this film is comedic. Twisted, pessimistic, yes, but comedy nonetheless. Don't get me wrong; I'm not saying that I sat there and laughed at the characters predicaments, but it definitely feels as though the filmmakers were intentionally creating a satirical mood, and subtly throwing shade at the audience. Call me crazy, but I thought it was funny. Technically speaking, I loved the editing and photography. It had that perfect gritty/grungy feel that I love so much about movies from this time period, and the portrayal of NYC was great (especially the underground art scene—these bits reminded me a little of parts from ""Slaves of New York"" for some reason). The flashback sequences and the party scenes were done VERY well —felt a bit like video art.",Midnight Cowboy
209,john-hogan23,"""I only get carsick on boats.""",8,7 December 2014,"The American Dad parody definitely did not prepare me for thisWhat a wonderfully sad movie. I'm not sure why I love tragic films, but they certainly hold a special place in my heart. I guess it's because of the way you have to contemplate the events of the film before you can really form an opinion on it. One of my favorite parts about watching movies is how they stick with you. This film will definitely stick with me. I really appreciated how much I had to think about what I had seen before I could decide what I really thought about it.The film's not perfect. Like with most adaptations of a novel there are sections where you can tell a lot of valuable content had to be left out. Where it does succeed, though, is maintaining the substance of the tragic melancholy that had been created by the novel. This film has plenty of weight behind it. If you're a person with too much empathy like me you'll probably become nauseous when you watch some of the things the duo have to go through. I'm the kind of person that was amused by the Saw series, gore doesn't affect me at all anymore, but the things in this film made me feel the way gore did before I became a numb, jaded huskperson.The high point of this film, the aspect that really makes it a success, is Dustin Hoffman's transformative performance. This is the guy that played Ben Braddock in The Graduate. I couldn't believe it when I read it. Hoffman is so convincing in this role he earned the type of pity from me I've only ever given to Javier Bardem's character in Biutiful, and that movie is relentlessly tragic. It conjured up enough depression for three films. When Ratso has to frantically limp to keep up with Joe on the street it broke my heart. When he was freezing practically to death on the decaying furniture in their condemned building I felt my shredded up heart sink into my gut then jump into my throat. When he fell down the stairs and couldn't stand on his own anymore I died and came back as a ghost because my unfinished business was trying to understand how a single scene could be so sad. Man, this movie is going to be with me for a long, long time. Despite the pain, though, I really love knowing that about a film.",Midnight Cowboy
210,nbbaiyuchen,HVCC Student Yuchen Bai Review,7,16 April 2016,"This film is as gritty and unpleasant as they come in its portrayal of the sleazy underbelly of New York City, and American society in general, at the conclusion of the 60s and the peak of the Sexual Revolution. Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight both deliver solid performances as unlikely companions whose dashed dreams and hopes provide an incredibly strong bond, a bond that is depended on for survival. ""Midnight Cowboy"" is uncomfortable, it is painful and it evokes emotion in ways never before seen on film. This experience deserves at least one viewing, as one may be all that can be handled. Overall, this is a wonderful performances from both of the leading men. An interesting, honest story. Hoffman's character really snuck up on me, all of a sudden I found myself deeply caring about him.",Midnight Cowboy

It's a film that deals with loneliness, forgiveness, acceptance...and ultimately, love. Hoffman and Voight are both wonderful and give top-notch performances. This film also has a great script, great camera work, and a wonderful musical score.  It's easy to see why it made the AFI top 100 films of all time.

213,Amym-24,A Great Film to Watch,10,5 December 2009,"Living the American Dream in today's society is very important to everybody. It is important for people to find a way to work themselves up to earn money in a career that'll make them happy and ready to enjoy life as it comes to them in great or consequential results. Finding yourself in life and helping friends and family out in times of need is the best way to establish yourself as a great, caring person, despite the obstacles that the individual had to face in life.The overall theme of the film was very compelling and heart felt. The screenplay for this film was written well. The acting from Voight and Hoffman throughout the film was excellent and very convincing through the mise-en-scene. These round characters were life-like, believable, and unpredictable through their actions as two men that are attempting to make a living in New York City as controversial con artists and prostitutes that use people for their wealth and pleasure in order to survive. The use of artificial light shone on Voigt's face during a night scene was used well. The use of back light on Ratzo's boss was really nice. The use of the color and black and white flashbacks and flash forewords in the montages were excellent and used well to show Joe's disturbing past and present future. The subjective editing through the video camera capturing the reaction of the party guests was used well.Overall, it was a great film. If you're interested in watching the incredible story of two friends from different backgrounds live together, help each other out in times of need, and struggle to live their American dreams and reach their dream in success, then watch this film.",Midnight Cowboy
214,Clockwork_Orange55,"""..a stellar pair of acting performances.""",8,5 August 2014,"""Midnight Cowboy"" really knows on how to build characters that would linger on for quite some time. ""Midnight"" introduces Joe Buck (Jon Voight) and his partner, 'Ratso' Rizzi (Dustin Hoffman). But how did thay' could possibly have scored distinction? The term 'distinction' I used was me referring to the ability of scoring being different; not to be perfect or marvelous. Buck stays with his appalled cowboy-texan outfit, while Ratso always sleeps with his black, gelled hair and seductive American-Italian accent. They do stay consistent with their characters' elements, and hence it made them unforgettable. Joe Buck? He is that cowboy. Ratso? The thick black haired guy with the accent.Joe Buck, a Texan dishwasher, makes his way to New York City to seek a fortune by becoming a male prostitute for women, some kind of a 'hustler', but instead, he only gets an uncomfortable friendship with a cripple con-man named Ratso. Instead of winning success in the city like how he first though he would get, he only wins a rotten apartment in a condemned building that Ratso offered after aimlessly living in the city for some time. The words that a friend of Buck used during its one of the opening sequences already quite have summed up the film: ""Oh, I bet you it's a mess back there (New York City)"".Joe Buck is naïve, why? Surely he had only spent his life in a small town of Texas and rarely engaged to the outside world and he is probably the most charming lad in Texas which led to an idea that he is that 'most-goodlooking-man' in the world, but undoubtedly he is not. His biggest flaw would be his ability to not notice that his beliefs are completely as a whole, is a mistake; only the public sees, and 'Ratso' Rizzi sees. Self-esteem being misplaced perhaps? Maybe. The worst fact about being naive is that you wouldn't be able to notice it for yourself, and ""Midnight"" able to show that thoroughly. The film's study on naivety is spot on.The plot's structure is simple and incredibly easy to follow, but the little details are the ones that are very difficult to adhere. The smaller stories will be thrown around throughout the film, and I have to help myself to fix the details that are being scattered. Upon my first viewing, through its flashback moments, I am only able to notice that Joe Buck was very lonely as a child; but Joe Buck goes for far more than that. Joe Buck is a character with depth and complexity, and ""Midnight"" rewards repeat viewings.The friendship between Joe Buck and 'Ratso' Rizzi is a pure breeze. The tie stays as a fun entertainment and a backbone of the picture; a miss will prove that the film will be less successful. The praise is supported by perfect performances and a suave screenplay written for the characters. Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are absolutely superb; the chemistry between the two talented stars stays in transcendence in modern cinema.Jon Voight flawlessly captured the sheer innocence of the character. His voice, and the intelligent navigation of facial expressions did help the character to appear natural or genuine. Hoffman on the other hand, succeed in becoming a crippled but yet charismatic loser. Oscar nominations for the two leads speak volumes.If you are a lazy movie audience, then it would be tough for you to enjoy the ""Midnight"" trip. I mentioned that the movie suggests enjoying throwing its stories around and having an expectation to fix them. ""Midnight"" never tells, but shows, and with that idea, you have to slightly be hard on yourself. But nonetheless, even if the movie is difficult, it is very easy to accept that the film features a stellar pair of acting performances.Score: 3/4(Cinematicmadness.blogspot.com)",Midnight Cowboy
215,smcguirk-88356,Depressing and Gritty,9,17 April 2016,I thoroughly enjoyed Midnight Cowboy and understand why it is understood as a great movie from the 1960's. The acting by Jon Voight (Joe Buck) and Dustin Hoffman (Ratso). Joe Buck is a stud from Texas moving to New York to make it big he then ends up meeting Ratso and befriending him even after he scammed him when he first met him. Their duo is very fascinating because they are living together in a condemned apartment and are fighting to survive. Their friendship is very unusual but they truly care for each other. The movie itself is very dark and depressing but groundbreaking because it was the only X rated film to win an Academy award for best picture which is amazing for the time just after the Hays Code.,Midnight Cowboy
216,zthaleb,Bored,3,10 May 2013,"I was really bored through out this movie, I did not really like the story at all. I thought it was really weird and unappealing. I think that the acting was way over the top and really annoying to watch. I just really wanted to stop watching the movie after 20 minutes but I powered through and watched it anyway. I honestly wish that I could have just fast forwarded it. To make it even worse it was predictable, there was no shocking twist. I guess I could say that the camera work was well done, but that is about the only good thing I could say about this. I do not think anyone should watch this movie.....ever.",Midnight Cowboy

However it isn't easy and he soon finds he has nowhere to stay and he looses all his belongings. He becomes friends with 'Ratso' (Dustin Hoffman) and together they earn and acquire enough money to stay alive.Due to the storyline and some of the other themes, I can see why this was a controversial and ground breaking movie in its time.

Even though it's from 1969, it's main themes (starting a new life, finding your way in a new environment) are still current. Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffmann do a magnificent job in playing two of society's misfits; people the world doesn't really want.Something I found rather surprising was that Midnight Cowboy deals with homosexuality quite a bit. It shows a number of gay people, all of whom have their own problems and views of life. The director does this in a way that we see the different issues someone, even today, might have with being gay. This unexpected subplot increased my enjoyment tremendously.Midnight Cowboy has won an Oscar for Best Picture. And it deserved it.",Midnight Cowboy
222,tinyredspoons,Interesting filming style,8,13 May 2011,"Garnering an X-rating when it was first released, Midnight Cowboy (19969) was one of those ""new Hollywood"" films that broke the rules. Not only did the film contain controversial story matter but, the film's style was also ahead of its time. At points in the movie when we as an audience see what a particular character is feeling the cinematographer portrays those feelings (or it seems that way) through special filming techniques. For example, the screen turns to black and white when Voight imagines catching Hoffman and when Hoffman dreams of Florida the screen turns almost too bright and lurid, and then there is the faded focus of Voight's Texas. Additionally, the scene where the two attend the party has color filters making the party seem even more ""trippy"". All of these serve to enhance the film's ability to make us as an audience connect to and understand the characters on screen better than a more straight-forward approach stylistically.",Midnight Cowboy

It is an excellent character study of men and what they will do to survive.Although I enjoyed the film, it certainly had some faults. The main theme song set a pleasant tone in the beginning, but wore thin as it was played incessantly throughout the film.

After reading reviews here on IMDb beforehand I was expecting a good film...and that is exactly what I got.the film really captures the era and how close the social boundaries were geographically. John Voight really did exude the naivety of his character without going over the line and becoming stupid or simple and yet still managed to command a presence in the relationship with Rizzo. Dustin Hoffman was pure magic in this film, you could almost taste the squalid stench of him and where he lived but although trying to survive was just as lonely as Joe and equally as vulnerable. The flashback scenes may have been a bit tacky (as stated by another reviewer) but still had a place showing that they dreamed of a better life away from the hardship they faced every day. In the end they escaped perhaps one day to late and what could have seen the lead characters better their lives it left us, the viewer feeling the loss of someone who just needed love.Give peas a chance",Midnight Cowboy

227,notevenwordshere,The story of a male prostitute with a heart of gold,9,22 November 2008,"Midnight Cowboy is the kind of film that's alternately hilarious and terribly creepy. If you can stand such a dichotomy, then you might enjoy this.It begins as a tale of Joe Buck (played perfectly by Jon Voight), a naive but charming Texas kid who travels to New York City with one goal in mind: seducing older women into sex and earning money while doing it. Plans, of course, do not go well -- he is humiliated and frightened more than once. Rico Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) is ostensibly Joe's only friend, teaching him how to live in a cold (both metaphorically and literally) city.As a tale of an unlikely friendship (devoid of clichés, mind you), Midnight Cowboy is a frantic success. John Schlesinger's direction is wired and trippy -- Stanley Kubrick seems to have utilized the wild-eyed flashbacks and drug-induced hazes of the camera-work here as the basis of the cinematography of A Clockwork Orange -- it's a hyper-realist depiction of the world. It can be off-putting and distracting, but it rarely is such a terrible thing: these moments of intense energy are often inner revelations of the characters; thus what we see is meant to reflect their present mental or emotional state.The movie's only flaw is that it runs too long. Some might complain about the ending, too, but I disagree: Midnight Cowboy can be a lot of fun, but it is mostly meant as a slice of existential dread. Its ending, as well as the murky pretense of the flashbacks, enhance this feeling quite well.Personally, while I liked Hoffman's character more, I felt that Voight's performance was better. Neither man won Best Actor, though both were nominated. To this day, Midnight Cowboy is the only film with a rating stronger than R (it was rated X when it came out in 1969) to win Best Picture. It is a daring and, even today, a subversively shocking movie -- it's far too visceral to appeal to most people. But if you're feeling like a cowboy....",Midnight Cowboy

I cannot say either was better than the other, Voight's portrayal of the naive Joe Buck and Hoffman's street savvy cripple are both screen gems. It's a particularly touching end as well as to be honest you don't really expect to feel much sympathy. I've not read the biogs fully of each actor but were they both nominated for Oscars for their roles? I haven't seen Dustin Hoffman in any better role since that of Ratzo, and Voight is back on our screens again lately quite deservedly.

Some were shocked by the sexuality of the movie. But that was never the point. The loneliness really was what shocked more, IMHO. Sexuality was only a means to assuage loneliness. the friendship, a means to end the loneliness which is the truest theme. I cried when I saw it for that theme alone. Sexuality is cheap...companionship is a far more precious thing. Gather your friends and family round in your heart after viewing this. you will appreciate them more.Very much like A Clockwork Orange, people were shocked by the violence in A Clockwork Orange and the sexuality in here. In both cases, the real point was missed. ACO had the main point of the loss of free will being a robbing of morality. and here....I think I said enough up there on it :)",Midnight Cowboy

The biggest weakness in this movie is we knew everything about Voight's character Joe Buck, but new nothing about Hoffman's character, ""Ratso"" Rizzo. Jon Voight plays an uneducated and clueless dishwasher from Texas who thinks he's going to get rich being a gigolo in New York. He meets a transient with a limp ,Rizzo, in a bar, and the two quickly depend on each other for survival, sharing a cockroach infested rat hole in NYC. This movie originally received an ""X"" rating, though I really don't see how, other than the ""flashbacks"" of his life had some perverted content in them. Obviously he was molested as a child by his pedophile granny.

When Ratso dies and you put his Florida dream scene together it is really sad because he is derelict who didn't get what he wanted. It was rated X in 1969 and changed to R in 1971.It was rated X because of the realistic sex scenes which isn't good for the film at all but the film itself is fascinating. It gets better and better.

234,wlandolfi-1,Classic Movie that was shocking on it's release.,9,1 March 2006,"I love MIDNIGHT COWBOY and have it in my video collection as it is a favorite of mine. What is interesting to me is how when MIDNIGHT COWBOY came out in 1969, it was so shocking to viewers that it was rated X. Of course, at that time X meant Maturity. Since I was only two years old at the time of the movie's release, it is hard for me to imagine just how shocked viewers were back then. However, when I try to take into account that many of the topics covered in the film, which included prostitution (the title itself was slang for a male prostitute); homosexuality; loneliness; physical (and to some extent emotional as well) abuse and drugs are hard for many people to talk about to this day, I can begin to get a sense of what viewers of this movie thought back on its release. It is worth noting that in the 1970's, MIDNIGHT COWBOY was downgraded to an R rating and even though it is still rated R, some of the scenes could almost be rated PG-13 by today's standards.I want to briefly give a synopsis of the plot although it is probably known to almost anyone who has heard of the movie. Jon Voight plays a young man named Joe Buck from Texas who decides that he can make it big as a male hustler in New York City escorting rich women. He emulates cowboy actors like Roy Rogers by wearing a cowboy outfit thinking that that will impress women. After being rejected by all the women he has come across, he meets a sleazy con-man named Enrico ""Ratso"" Rizzo who is played by Dustin Hoffman. Ratso convinces Joe that he can make all kinds of money if he has a manager. Once again, Joe is conned and before long is homeless. However, Joe comes across Ratso and is invited to stay in a dilapidated apartment. Without giving away much more of the plot, I want to say that the remainder of the movie deals with Joe and Ratso as they try to help one another in an attempt to fulfill their dreams. I.E. Joe making it as a gigolo and Ratso going down to Florida where he thinks he can regain his health.I want to make some comments about the movie itself. First of all, the acting is excellent, especially the leads. Although the movie is really very sad from the beginning to the end, there are some classic scenes. In fact, there are some scenes that while they are not intended to be funny, I find them amusing. For example, there is the classic scene where Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight are walking down a city street and a cab practically runs them over. Dustin Hoffman bangs on the cab and says ""Hey, I'm walkin' here! I'm walkin' here!"" I get a kick out of that scene because it is so typical of New York City where so many people are in a hurry. Another scene that comes to mind is the scene where Ratso (Dustin Hoffman) sends Joe (Jon Voight) to a guy named O'Daniel. What is amusing is that at first, we think O'Daniel is there to recruit gigolos and can see why Joe is getting so excited but then we begin to realize that O'Daniel is nothing but a religious nut. In addition to the two scenes I mentioned, I love the scene where Ratso and Joe are arguing in their apartment when Ratso says to Joe that his cowboy outfit only attracts homosexuals and Joe says in self-defense ""John Wayne! You gonna tell me he's a fag!"" What I like is the delivery in that scene.I would say that even though MIDNIGHT COWBOY was set in the late '60's, much of it rings true today. That's because although the area around 42nd Street in New York has been cleaned up in the form of Disneyfication in the last several years, homelessness is still just as prevalent there now as it was 40 years ago. Also, many people have unrealistic dreams of how they are going to strike it big only to have their dreams smashed as was the case with the Jon Voight character. One thing that impresses me about Jon Voight's character is how he is a survivor and I felt that at the end of the movie, he had matured a great deal and that Ratso (Dustin Hoffman's character) was a good influence on him.In conclusion, I want to say that I suggest that when watching this movie, one should watch it at least a couple of times because there are so many things that go on. For example, there are a bunch of flashback and dream sequences that made more sense to me after a couple of viewings. Also, what I find interesting is that there is a lot in this movie that is left to interpretation such as what really happened with Joe Buck (Jon Voight's character) and the people who were in his life in Texas. Even the ending, while I don't want to give it away for those who have not seen the movie, is rather open-ended.",Midnight Cowboy
235,katrowellpa,Dark Spirituality Gets a Voice,10,4 September 2012,"Simply put, a masterpiece. Jon Voight is superb as the enthusiastic Joe Buck, who is through a series of jarring flashbacks, shown to be haunted by events from his childhood, particularly regarding his grandmother. At the beginning of the movie, Joe Buck quits his job and hops on a bus to New York City, where he becomes a very unsuccessful hustler. His hustling leads him to Ratso Rizzo, played by Dustin Hoffman. The unlikely pair develop a great friendship and some of my favorite parts of the movie are the scenes where the 2 of them are walking the busy streets of New York City together, with Joe Buck and his cowboy hat towering about a foot over Ratso. It is a visual that will stay in your mind long after the movie is over.There are many big themes going on in this movie, including death, Americana and spirituality, albeit a very dark spirituality. This movie would probably never get made today, and that is just a shame. The acting and cinematography are both excellent.",Midnight Cowboy
236,herbert_heart,An unexpectedly moving and lovable experience,10,4 April 2009,"There are plenty of movies about losers, ""Trainspotting"" is a more recent and memorable one. In my opinion ""Midnight Cowboy"" is the best movie about losers and a great movie about friendship.I admit that I feel that this movie is packed with metaphors - but I only understood a fraction of them. There are also a notable number of flashbacks that never quiet resolve. But that does not matter since this movie is able to produce strange, unforeseen and intense emotions.I see Joe Buck's and Ratzo Rizzo's likable relationship in the center of those emotions. Voight's and Hoffman's play is outrageous, I never saw a better Hoffman, not even in ""The Godfather"". I have not seen much of Voight at all but he, too, acts just great.""Marathon Man"" is another superb Schlesinger film, of course. I recommend both for a DVD night. They really go together well, ""Marathon Man"" is a solid and intelligent Thriller and ""Midnight Cowboy"" is ... hard to say what but very strong.",Midnight Cowboy
237,inemjaso,A Classic to be remembered,10,6 May 2017,"An X-rated film at the time of its release, Midnight Cowboy is the definition of the Hayes Code ending and New Hollywood beginning. The film centers around Joe Buck, a young Texan dishwasher played by Jon Voight, whose confidence in his looks and southern charisma lead him to pack for New York with the intention of becoming a male prostitute. The irony being, his first ""taker' ends up being a working woman herself and Buck ends up giving her money instead. In New York, Buck meets Ratso, a street smart New Yorker with a limp whose blunt nature and smart mouth are a perfect compliment to Buck's dry Texan humor. In addition to exploring sexuality and the boundaries of sexual explicitness which with the American public was comfortable in the late 1960s, the film does a fine job touching upon mental illness, with the local girl Annie, drug use and experimentation, as observed in the party scene, and also the alienation many felt during this period. Alienated characters were a staple in film noir and loneliness and finding one's purpose are themes most people can identify with. However, something about the loneliness of the two main characters in this film whose bond with one another is the only thing preventing the other from emotionally crumbling is too real and strikingly well executed in the film's end. A must watch for any fan of classic New Hollywood movies.",Midnight Cowboy
238,j-maloney13,great performances by Hoffman and Voight,8,11 May 2017,"It's easy to see why this film won so many awards, even with all of the controversy surrounding it's nudity and explicit images for the time. The camera work was done really well, and many different types of shots were used such as close ups, tracking, medium and medium- long, long, and high and low angle shots. There were several great, establishing shots of the city as well. Tilt shots were used often too. Aside from this, the non-diegetic soundtrack was very good even though there wasn't a whole lot of music in this film. Some interesting things I found while watching were the ""montage"" type shot of Joe Buck in bed with a woman. While they were in bed, the television in the room was fully displayed, and the channel was changing rapidly. Every once in a while the two in bed would be displayed as if they were on the TV as well. Another thing I enjoyed in this film was how close we could get to Buck's character. There were several shots of him imagining something happening, which helps us get into the mind of his character. Lastly, I liked the costume choice, and how Buck was wearing a cowboy outfit while in New York City, making him appear out of place. Overall, I really thought Hoffman and Voight did a tremendous job in this film, as they obviously won awards for their roles.",Midnight Cowboy
239,themullofkintyre,A depressing classic,9,8 December 2017,The great thing about this film is that it was originally X Rated which is fascinating because everything in it is like and R rated film but obviously that wasn't a thing at the time.

You get to see a man try and follow his heart and meet a man in the EXACT same situation only to see a slow and sad downfall.,Midnight Cowboy
240,Shishi17,New York is like no other,9,24 April 2019,"Hustling in Texas and hustling in New York is not the same. New Yorkers are on another level, they hustle harder and faster. This is what Joe Buck learned when he came to New York. This movie was a little disturbing, Joe Bucks flash backs alone showed that he was a disturbed individual. Typically one would not aspire to become a male prostitute in the big city. Joe Buck had issues with his parents, women and people in general. Ratso also had issues with his father. I think that this is where the connection began with the two. Overall I thought Midnight Cowboy was a good movie, I think it went a little overboard with the use of offensive language but the Code was gone and full advantage was taken. Even though this movie was disturbing I still thought the whole plot was great. The acting, the characters everything. We get inside the mind of Joe Buck and then boom.... another tragedy happens. I didn't really see any good that happened once he got to New York. I thought the movie was sad.",Midnight Cowboy

242,Monigan,an ever-relevant classic,10,3 April 2000,"I am not a sentimental person.  Midnight Cowboy is the first movie that has ever made me cry, and it made me SOB.  It is such an accurate prtrayal of two of the most poignant things in the human world: platonic friendship and failed dreams.  I think the comparisons to Easy Rider are inaccurate; Easy Rider's psychedelic tone relied heavily on cheesy camera effects and overbearing music; the graveyard acid sequence seems overwhelmingly dated. Although Midnight Cowboy employs its fair share of hallucinogenuc camerawork, the fundamental cinematography is still quite strong.  (I will never forget the final shot of palm trees reflected against Rizzo's face.) Also, unlike the hipsters of Easy Rider, Buck and Rizzo are fundamentally outsiders.  They are not icons of the 70s scene; they are looking in on it helplessly. I think this film will last. Monigan",Midnight Cowboy
243,heero_yuy2,Too modern for a 1969 movie,8,27 March 2005,"Normally hearing about this Oscar winner for Best Picture, I might as well try it out.Jon Voight is a feel-cowboy stud with a gleam past life trying to raise money in the Big Apple, until he met a small-time crook croak-legged homeless Dustin Hoffman, a seemingly mutual friendship amidst the non-reliability of raising money in the hardness of city life.After watching this movie...I thought it was an 80's movie. It feels like an 80's movie. I might say that Dustin Hoffman has been this versatile in acting and it shows from watching a bunch of his movies with different roles. The story was simple, not like Godfather or Platoon or Clockwork Orange...but I think the thing that makes it for the Best Picture Award is for feeling this film when you're watching it in 1969. It really feels too modern for a 1969 simple story movie. Recommended for movie collectors.",Midnight Cowboy
244,ruwimalpathiraja,A poignant drama with a tinge of the surreal,9,1 May 2020,"Joe Buck is a strapping young fella heading off to ""the east"" to make his fortune hustling. Little does he know of the vices of the Big Apple, and a shady Dustin Hoffman as the aptly named ""Ratso"" (Rizzo) is only too delighted to show young Joe the ropes. Their parasitic relationship morphs gently into a wary companionship as the duo evolve into partners in crime, fending off the cold and the cruel cynicism of the city.The beautifully constructed narrative is mostly linear, with a few intriguing flashbacks interspersed with the occasional day dream; a refreshing combination that keeps the viewer interested. The opening sequence of the movie is wickedly misleading, as the initially upbeat tone of the story takes on increasingly darker hues before concluding with a truly moving ending.The three Oscar wins come as no surprise; Schlesinger's direction is indeed masterful, although it is peculiar that neither Jon Voight nor Hoffman won Oscars for their amazingly soulful acting. The cinematography of the film deserves much credit; the surreal events of the party and the flashbacks into Joe's past have a distorted yet vivid feel to them.This movie is a slice of the 60's and 70's; like a long forgotten tome it rests among shelves of classic cinema, echoing in the minds of anyone lucky enough to chance upon it.

246,John0711,Analysis of Midnight Cowboy,4,5 December 2019,"Opening of movie is very different then any of the other movies I have watched for my American Cinema Class:
1. It's fully color
2. And it doesn't start with the opening credits.
3. The opening credits appear over the scene that is going on in the movie.
Joe has a lot of flashbacks but the flashbacks seem kind of haunting. Flashbacks of something that he might be trying to get away from or something he is trying to get back to.
One shot that I like in movie is when you can tell the camera is being held by hand. In the scene where Joe is on the bus and there is a short clip of the city; it almost feels like a video that I would of taken off of my phone.
A more clever way of not showing a sexual encounter, the shots go back and forth from TV stations as Joe and the women roll over the remote.",Midnight Cowboy

248,Trimac20,Unique,8,23 December 2004,"The only reason I knew of Midnight Cowboy was because it was in the AFI Critic's Top 100. For a top 100 it is not a very well known movie; indeed, I had to look hard to find a copy, I got the DVD version for about half-price. Surprisingly it was only rated M15+ (the uncut version).I doubt many will take notice of this review (more like comment) so I'll make it brief.This is perhaps one of the strangest movies I've seen, partly because of the use of montages, artistic filming (very art-house) and the unusual theme. There are many things in the film I still don't understand (I've seen it twice), and it makes for an emotionally confusing film.The filming and acting were very good, and it is the larger than life characters which make this film memorable. The main character is Joe Buck, a 'cowboy' from Texas who moves to New York to become a male prostitute. He meets the crippled conman Enrico 'Ratso' Rizzo and, of course they become friends going through the usual escapades. What makes the film interesting is the two characters are so different.I felt the film didn't really develop the relationship between Buck and Enrico Rizzo for the audience to have any real emotional connection, although the ending is certainly quite sad and tragic. You probably already know what happens by reading the reviews, but its pretty obvious from the start.I personally think the film beautifully and poignantly explores its main themes. The deprivation of humanity (shown by the darkness of the city streets, the breaking-down tenements). Most of the characters in the film exist beyond the law (a conman, giggolo.etc) yet you can't help liking them. Joe Buck is endearing because he is so naive and optimistic, while we begin to feel pity for Ratso later in the film.I think the film was rated so high because it was certainly very ground-breaking for its period. At the time (And even now) it was definitely not a typical movie (quite art-house). At a time when the cinema was dominated by tired westerns, musicals and dramas a film with such an unusual theme as Midnight Cowboy pops up.On a personal level, I must say I quite liked the film. The imagery conveyed a dream-like quality. I particularly liked the scene at the party, the music, images etc stay in your mind for a long time after watching. However, as a movie for entertainment's sake it was a bit lacking (not really my style of movie) in thrills. This is a film to be savoured and appreciated, rather than a cheap thrills action flick.Although I would hardly consider myself qualified to analyse this film, the characters and their motives were quite interesting. From what I understand from the flashbacks, Joe Buck was sexually abused as a child by his grandmother, although it still doesn't seem to be relevant to the story. He is a happy-go-lucky young stud, who suppresses his darker memories. The religious connotations in the film are also puzzling. Some have suggested a homosexual connection between Buck and Ratso, although I fail to see where they have got the idea from. The theme of homo-sexuality in general is more than touched upon in their conversation, and later in Joe Buck's encounter with a lonely old man, but it has little to do with the main story.Certainly from a technical point of view one of the finest films of the decade (it has more of a 70s feel to it than a 60s feel) and revolutionary for its time touching on subjects few other films dared to do. While it has a simple, sentimental story to it (disguised by a hard edge) the beauty of the film is in the strange, often psychedelic sequences.",Midnight Cowboy

It's also a melodrama, operatic but hidden in a reality that can't possibly be real. Dustin Hoffman is as bold as Bette Davis in a Warner Brothers melodrama. Amazing. And Jon Voight? - He wasn't the first choice, Michael Sarrazin was. Jon Voight plays his whore with a heart of gold with the decency of a Mary Astor in another melodrama from the the 40's. I've seen Midnight Cowboy 5 times, the first time in a theater, three other times in VHS or DVD - Last night I saw it in a huge screen in the house of a friend. HD I believe and, Oh my God. I wept. I was taken over completely by this two devastating, truly devastating characters. John Schlesiger the director, a genius.

250,jolieschu,A really great example of how to write effective characters,9,6 December 2017,"I did not expect to get as attached to Rizo and Joe as i did. The movie takes you through the whole evolution of their friendship, and leaves on a hopeful note at the end. The redemption of Joe is very much tied to his bond with Rizo-and both end up in a better place than they were at the start of the movie; and probably their lives. This movie deserves all the praise I've heard about it. It's a much watch for writers or anyone who deals in characters. Dustin Hoffman; who plays Rizzo, is in a kind of role I never would have expected to see him play. But it's an impactful one, for sure. I actually really love the music they chose for this as well. The lyrics and pacing of the music really fit well into this world that has been depicted for us. Though keep in mind it is rated R for some content.",Midnight Cowboy
251,dlaferriere,summary,3,9 February 2006,"This movie was about the coming together of opposites to achieve the same goal. Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) and Joe Buck (Jon Voigt) are complete opposites but they come together and work together to achieve their goal. Joe Buck comes from a little town in Texas where he doesn't fit in. So Joe moves to New York to make it big, like everyone that moves to the Big Apple wants to do. The only thing that is different about Joe is that he plans to make his money by selling himself for sexual favors. This is where Rizzo comes in.Rizzo is from New York City, and is a true city man. He lives in a run down apartment and he has barely anything. He is ignorant and he lives off other people, and that is how he met Joe. Joe is naïve and has no place to go so when he runs into Rizzo he moves in with him even though he doesn't really want to. They are both complete opposites at the time, the only thing they have is that Joe needs a place to live and Rizzo has that place. Rizzo helps Joe out in his male prostitution because Joe isn't very good at it. Over time Rizzo becomes Joe's pimp, and they work together to help Joe sell his body and make them some money.By the end of the movie these two friends have molded together into the same man. Joe has rubbed off on Rizzo a little making him not as ignorant, and Rizzo has rubbed off on Joe by making him a hard, tough city man. So at the beginning of the movie these two were complete opposites from completely different backgrounds. By the end they were friends and they were working together to support themselves. By working together and living together they became similar men both after the American Dream. They went about the Dream differently then most people do, but they were still going after it none the less. So that is how two men that were complete opposites can come together to accomplish the same goal of living the American Dream.",Midnight Cowboy
252,kwalsh2-1,Loneliness,7,10 February 2006,"Katie Walsh Midnight Cowboy ReviewMidnight Cowboy follows the story of a man, Joe Buck, played by Jon Voight, caught between two worlds. He leaves his small Texas town, with no future for him, to travel to New York City, where his inexperience leads him through many humiliating adventures. He befriends Rico ""Ratzo"" Rizzo, played by Dustin Hoffman, who is a sleazy cripples who originally steals money from him. The two men are both lost within this fast-paced world, stuck in a condemned building with the only money for food coming from Joe's pathetic attempts at hustling. The film goes through a series of vignettes that piece together his past as objects trigger his memory. For instance, when Joe looks into the beauty salon window he pictures himself giving his grandmother a massage. Through these images we piece together a past full of sorrows such as, a relationship with a girl that led to a gang-bang, and a mother who abandoned him at his grandmother's doorstep. The girl from his past is the dominant voice inside his head throughout the movie. The fact that he becomes a hustler seems to be explained by the rape associated with her, degrading him into a job where he no longer needs to respect himself, but still earns a lot of money. This failure from before premeditates his failure later on in life. As he looks into the window in New York City, he sees himself as a dishwasher again, stuck in a low-paying job with little meaning. The relationship between Hoffman and Voight on screen displays homosexual tendencies that are never fully played out. These subtle motions are shown through the scene where Rizzo hugs Joe, and at the end, when Joe puts his arm around him. The sex scene with the girls from the party becomes interesting. She suggests that he is gay with Hoffman's character, but instead of denying it, he merely proves himself in the bedroom to her. There are also two other gay scenes, where a teenager seduces him in a movie theatre, and an old man brings him back to his place. In both cases, Voight becomes extremely violent as he throws the kid up against the wall, but the old man is knocked unconscious. We see the development of Voight's character since the teenager was let off without giving him anything because Joe was still naïve to the ways of the city. However, his heart had been hardened by the time the old man tried to offer him ten dollars for merely coming up to the room. He shows almost no sympathy as he knocks the man to and fro in an attempt to reach the money needed to bring Rizzo to safety. That fact alone shows the extremely close ties between Rizzo and Joe.A prevailing theme of loneliness jumps off the screen as viewers watch Joe go through a series of disappointments in his life. He is abandoned by everyone so that by the end, he remains completely alone. For this reason alone, I would rate the movie a 7 out of 10. The loneliness engulfed me as I walked back to my room, which shows great direction, but I prefer to be happy.",Midnight Cowboy
253,gleebs75,Loss of a dream,5,9 February 2006,"Midnight Cowboy is a film about a fake cowboy from Texas named Joe and a crippled bum from the Bronx named Rico and their struggle to make it out of the dredges of society. Throughout the entire film there is the hope of a better tomorrowan unrealized hope, in the end.The concept of the unattainable American dream is very prevalent in this film. It begins with Joe's flight from Texaslooking to leave his sordid past behind him and move on to greener pastures. What he gets are the hard, cold streets of New York City, which are not as promising as he'd hoped for. He continuously is reminded of his past, no matter how he may try to escape it, and is not able to make his dream of becoming a rich man a reality. He wants to be a hustler but he is too ignorant of city life to be able to figure it out and too sexually confused (it would seem) to be able to do it well.Enter Rico Rizzo, a crippled, dirty, lowlife bum who would do anything to make a dime so that he could move to Floridathe focus of the two men's American dream for the rest of the film. Rico (nicknamed ""Ratso"" due to his scheming nature) tries to help Joe out with his hustler dreams, but to no avail. Joe often has to resort to male customers, which perhaps says something about his sexuality.Right before Joe is about to go home with his first paying woman customer, Rico has a bad fall down the stairs. Joe (who had just unknowingly experimented with marijuana) was worried but forced by the necessity of money to go back to the woman's place with her. There, he is unable to sustain an erection for long enough to successfully finish having sex with her at first. To me, this crippling feature in Joe parallels Rico's crippled state, and the fall that had occurred directly before. Also, it seems further evidence that Joe's preferences lie in menwhen is finally able to perform, it's only because the woman accused him of being gay and he was trying to prove her wrong. He is continuously defensive of his sexuality, which is characteristic of someone who is trying to overcompensate or hide their true preferences.The relationship between Joe and Rico is quite the peculiar one. They argue, they share intimate moments (Joe often nurses Rico's sicknesses throughout the film), and they share the same dream of success and wealth. They head off to Florida at the end of the filmRico in a worse and worse state. Just as they're entering Miami, Rico dies with Joe contemplating the way their life could be once they arrive. With Rico dies the dream Joe had for the two of thembuilding themselves up the old fashioned way and being able to live together happily. The dream had to die because it could never really be alive to begin with. There was no way in the 1960s that two men could live together happily (whether as friends or lovers, and it's not entirely clear which Rico and Joe were) and successfully when they started off in the state they were in. The film leaves the audience wondering how Joe will try to move on to escape yet another painful chapter of his past behind.",Midnight Cowboy

The movie appears to be normal, until the party scene at the house of the brother and sister Hansel and Gretel.  This wild, acid trip of a party really brings out the character of the sixties.  Some scenes may seem funny (Ratso stealing food, Ratso falling down) but really aren't.  These scenes actually show the reality of life.  Somethings aren't as easy as they appear.  Along with Schindler's List, I think that this is one of the hardest films to watch.  This is mainly in part to the scene where Joe attacks Towny, a man who invites Joe up to his room for mysterious reasons, and steals his money.  Another upsetting part is the end when Ratso dies. Just as Joe says he's giving up being a hustler and about 5 minutes before arriving in Miami, Ratso dies on the bus, as every passenger stares with wonder as Joe embraces the dead body of his only friend in the world.

This movie is extremely dark and covers very adult subject matter, and the script does a fantastic job of giving these heavy topics the weight they deserve. The structure of the story lends itself well to the plot as well, with important information being revealed through flashbacks as the story in the present day progresses. The performances by both Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are extremely good, and their interactions in key scenes can get very emotional. The film is also very well paced, with editing that knows when to let things breathe, lending a very grounded and natural feel to the movie.

259,jcoolum,"""I'm walking here! I'm walking here!""",7,9 February 2006,"Midnight Cowboy is one of the most unique films I have ever seen. The film starts by introducing Joe Buck (Jon Voight) to us. We see him getting dressed in his cowboy suit and packing his suitcase. His suit is loud, with his bright shirt and cowboy hat, in an era that most people did not dress that way. He seems somewhat surreal and over the top. He goes to what seems to be his job and quits because he intends to travel to New York City from Texas. We are not quite sure what his intentions are. He mentions, to a friend, that he wants to become a male hustler when he arrives in New York. He meets many different people on the bus to New York. During this time, we see that Joe is essentially a nice person. There is a scene where he makes friendly gestures towards a kid. This scene is ironic because we get the impression that Joe is also a child. He seems very naive in almost every way. His naiveté is shown in the way he dresses, thinking himself to be a cowboy, in the way he acts, in the way he feels it is going to be easy to be a male hustler, and in the way he feels living in New York is going to be so much easier than living in Texas.When Joe arrives in New York, he realizes that it was not going to as easy as he thought. He tries to get women to notice him and realize that he is a male hustler but to no avail. One woman does notice him and they have sex. Then she asks him for money for a cab before he asks for money for the sex. When he does, she breaks down and cries. Joe, being a genuinely nice person, offers her money for the cab and she eventually receives twenty dollars. This scene shows how naive Joe really is. Eventually Joe meets the other protagonist in the film, Rico Salvatore Rizzo a.k.a. ""Ratso"" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman). Ratso seems to know the ropes and how the city works. He has one limp leg and he does not look like a very trustworthy person at first glance. Eventually, the two create a friendship after Joe needs a place to live and Ratso lets Joe live with him. Together, they meet hard times, without money and they live through a winter without heat.Each main character has a plan or a dream. Joe wants to become a successful male hustler in order to become rich while Ratso wants to go to Florida and live there. It seems, while watching the film, that neither character will achieve his dream. It is sad, but realistic because, for most people, things do not work out the way they plan. In America, we have been taught that anyone can do anything; that is the American dream. This film shows quite the opposite. Joe never becomes a successful hustler and Ratso dies at the end of the film. Midnight Cowboy film mirrors Peter Fonda and Dennis Hopper's Easy Rider. Both films deal with journeys and the destruction of the American dream. Both films have sad endings and do not leave the audience with any good feelings. At the end of the film, Joe's naiveté leaves him at the end of the film. When Joe and Ratso arrive in Florida, Joe has to be one in charge because Ratso is unable to walk. Joe buys new clothes and dumps his cowboy outfit. This is the first time we see him without it. After Ratso dies, we know that Joe has to fend for himself and grow up.As I said before, this was a unique film. It had great performances by Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman. It was superbly directed by John Schlesinger. The film still seems to be odd to me but a likable film nonetheless. It will go down as one of the best modern classics out there. I recommend the film. Even though I am not sure everyone will like it, it is still a film everyone should see.",Midnight Cowboy
260,alexadaniels-25648,Midnight Cowboy,7,29 April 2019,"I enjoyed watching the film Midnight Cowboy. I thought the coloring, lighting and acting was all very good. One thing I found interesting was sexuality displayed in the movie. Although the censorship code had ended years before, it was just interesting to me to compare this film to one from the 1930s. For example, before, movies could not show married couples sleeping in the same bed. Within the first twenty minutes of this film they show a man kissing all over a women, her taking off her clothes in front of him, and sexual talk. This is just an interesting change and shift in film content that caught my attention.",Midnight Cowboy
261,chrislivings,Worth 50p in a charity shop.,6,2 August 2020,Lots of clever editing and imaginary direction here. Very little story in fact after we meet Dustin for the second time nothing much happens. Loads of 60s 70s films were turned out with there subject matter purely decided contary to what was and could be shown on TV thus loads of sex violence and weird stuff. Trust me even with the touching relationship between the two friends you'll be praying for the damn thing to finish.,Midnight Cowboy
262,grotchly,An incredible movie about friendship (NO spoilers!),10,9 July 2004,"I won't go on about the incredible acting and directing in this film. It is. What I don't see anyone mentioning in their comments is what I mainly get out of this film - the development of a great friendship. Without spoiling it for you, what happens is Joe Buck leaves his rural hometown with dreams of striking it rich in New York City. What he encounters is a life he never expected. He struggles to get by any way he can (a disturbing part of the film for most). In the meantime, he meets Ratzo Rizzo and develops the deepest of friendships. (In that respect it is similar to The Shawshank Redemption.) This is what I find beautiful about this film. Joe Buck goes in search of superficial things (money and fame) only to instead find many of the true things one needs in life - love, trust, and friendship.Now that I've completely cornified this movie, go watch it!",Midnight Cowboy
263,DSearch1,"The most overrated ""masterpiece"" ever?",1,3 June 2006,"In the words of another ""classic"" of the period, where do I begin? Finally saw this Academy Award winner on DVD (I was 14 when it made its X-rated theater debut) and was appalled at how bad it was.Hoffman and Voight do credible jobs in the lead roles. And the soundtrack is enjoyable. But the plot is threadbare, and the two main characters so endlessly stupid as to be implausible.(SPOILER example: In a scene which could have come straight from Jim Carrey's ""Dumb and Dumber,"" Buck and Ratso hang outside a male escort agency to pickpocket a lead from a departing gigolo. The agency is RIGHT THERE  why doesn't Buck simply apply for a job?) One gets the feeling if the two passed a display on Park Avenue offering free money, they'd conspire to steal the sign instead.A party scene later in the film is straight out of the Late '60s Psychedelic Party filmmaker's manual. The main reason the predictability of the conclusion wasn't overly disappointing was because I stopped caring about these two clowns an hour into the film. Sad to say this Midnight Emperor is as unclothed as its Oscar statuettes.",Midnight Cowboy
264,HedonisticActor,It was...interesting at least,7,1 July 2006,"Midnight Cowboy differs freshly from the movies of 60s. The story is about Joe Buck (Jon Voight) a male hustler from Texas who moves to New York for money. There he meets Enrico ""Ratso"" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) who helps him in money earning. Both of those actors are charismatics and express their role greatly. For example when Joe Buck is going to New York in bus and he tries to talk with people around him his feeling from being an outsider can be felt in any audience.The story is quite unique and handles finely human emotions There are however couple of problems. First some parts of the movie have little too long scenes for example when Joe Buck is walking along the streets of New York or mysterious party of 60s where Joe and Rizzo are invited. Second is Joe Buck's flashbacks from his past. Although they try to show Joe's past they don't serve any clear function. In some of his flashbacks is a guy who looks like Rizzo (or is it him really?) and he seems to be quite hostile but it now underlines too much the fact that Joe doesn't trust at first some helping stranger. The whole movie would have survive without those flashbacks too.In summary Midnight Cowboy is a good movie but not a great movie. The chaotic script survives mostly due of its excellent actors. You can also live without watching this but it is...at least interesting to watch.",Midnight Cowboy
265,epppie,Dustin Hoffman's best performance.,9,8 October 2006,"Jon Voight is brilliant in Midnight Cowboy, but Hoffman's performance, though reminiscent of his later turn in Rainman, is the kind of performance that keeps me watching movies. As a portrayal of a New York character, only Daniel Day Lewis' portrayal of Bill Butcher in Gangs of New York comes to mind as comparable, and Day doesn't give his character the emotional depth that Hoffman gives Ratso. It's typical of Hoffman's way of acting that the actor we tend to identify most with Midnight Cowboy is Voight. I think Hoffman is one of the 4 or 5 best actors in the history of film at playing off the people around him in such a way that he raises their performances far above their normal levels. Voight's Buck is so naive that he would float out of the film altogether, except that Ratso pulls him down - pulls him down, but also teaches him, a lot about how to survive and, more importantly, how to live.Midnight Cowboy is a movie about escape that turns into a movie about finding yourself. I think that, as gritty a movie as it is, it has a very beautiful message, that no matter how much a loser you might be (Ratso clearly defines ""loser""), if you can find a way to be true to yourself, you are in possession of the secret of life, and you might even be able to share that insight with someone else. I can't help but compare Midnight Cowboy to Klute, from a few years later, which I think is more like a movie about finding yourself that turns into a movie about escape.",Midnight Cowboy
266,rhall-14,Nicht,7,10 February 2006,"This film, directed by John Schlesinger, was certainly deserving of its Best Picture Oscar in 1969. A hugely American movie, taking place in Texas, New York City, Florida, and places in between, Midnight Cowboy tells the story of two startlingly different people who end up relying on one another to survive because of their similar situations. Joe Buck, played by a young Jon Voight, is a cocky, innocent, and totally unprepared young Texan who moves to New York to become a male hustler. During his time there he meets up with Enrico Salvatore Rizzo (Ratso), played by Dustin Hoffman. Ratso has an appearance that is similar to his nickname, but despite his gross exterior, he is an experienced New Yorker who knows how to survive on the streets.The film opens in Texas, following young Joe as he begins his journey from his tiny rural town to the metropolitan area of the Northeast. The naïve, gum chewing Joe is in high spirits as he moves slowly (in a cramped Greyhound bus) toward his intended future as a hustler. In these scenes on the bus, the director gives us various shots of people on the bus and around it that seem to symbolize something to Joe. The old man who he offers the cigarette to seems to show him what he would have become if he wasn't leaving Texas. The old woman who takes the old man's seat further in the trip spurs a transition to a flashback of his grandmother. Outside the bus the camera focuses in on signs like ""Jesus Saves"" and other obvious aspects of Texas life, creating a great comparison for when Joe reaches New York.When he finally arrives in New York, Joe's attempts at becoming a male hustler are not successful. Then finally he does have sex with an older married woman, but when he asks her for money she cries, making a scene and forcing him to pay her. In a state of slight desperation and complete failure, Joe allows himself to be played over by Ratso. Here, Joe's New York life goes to hell. As his situation worsens and he is forced into doing unwanted things (such as homosexual acts in movie theaters) the makers of the film give the viewers more quick flashbacks, and we begin to understand why Joe has come to New York, and what he is running away from.Eventually, through an interesting turn of events, Joe and Ratso begin living together in an abandoned apartment complex that Ratso has been squatting in. Things begin with Ratso using his fiendish ways to help Joe clean his clothes, steal food and start to get back into the hustling business. But later, when winter sets in on the city and Ratso gets a fever and stops walking well, Joe is forced to take care of this scumbag turned best friend. This occurs when Joe has just had sex with a woman for money he met at a tripped out drug party, and his hustling business seems to be gaining steam again. Instead, he is forced to resort to his homosexual ways again in order to get money. He even steals from a man, beating him and perhaps killing him in the process in order to get money to bring Ratso to Florida, the warm place of his dreams.In general, Midnight Cowboy is a film about desperation, avoiding one's past and mainly the failure to fulfill ones dreams. We see this through both main characters. We see through Ratso's daydreams that he wishes to live in Florida and be the manager of a resort for older people. This daydream is shattered at first by Joe's failure to pick up the woman in the hotel, and ultimately destroyed when Ratso dies on the bus upon entering Florida, his dream place. His true life is the complete opposite of his dream. Joe, on the other hand, realizes that his dream of becoming a male hustler can lead to nothing. He is trying to escape a troubled past where his girlfriend (and probably Joe as well) was raped, and where he had a strange and perhaps sexually abusive relationship with his grandmother. Joe fails in New York, and then fails to get Ratso to Florida alive, and is left on his own. This film ends in a depressing way, and although Joe is alive, with fresh clothes on his back, we get the sense that without Ratso to help guide him, he will be lost in this new location like he was in New York.",Midnight Cowboy

This was one of Jon Voight's early movies, one of his best, not to mention the Odessa Files, and my favorite film of his ""The Runaway Train"" with Eric Roberts and Rebecca DeMornay. No one hardly ever sees movies like this anymore because of Censorship. This movie depicts the dark underground and shady characters, and the low life elements of New York City where a newcomer can easily fall prey to their greed and use him to the last of drop of humanity he had left.

Well, first of all, it was played on UK TV last night, but it wasn't the comments that made me want to watch the film, it was the Harry Nielsen theme tune that made me want to watch it. I downloaded the mp3 a couple of years back, but it was pleasant to now match the song to the right picture...Midnight Cowboy is indeed a great adventure of a film. To describe Joe Buck here is to spoil it for you to let your imagination paint his character, because thats what the first 10 mins of the film does.Try doing what he did - to traverse from the big country to a big city, where Joe isn't contaminated by the dark traits of city life, where no one says hello to each other on the streets, where people fear of being robbed, where people walk with heads down. No, no... Joe Buck treats everyone equal, with a nice massive ""Howdy to y'all from Texas"".I couldn't lose concentration while watching the film: you actually do become involved.

A fun fast paced movie with a heart felt climax. NYC is a character in this film, which is always fun in the 60s and 70s movies. Again another very real film, gritty and true to the times. Hoffman and Voight draw the viewer into an intense NYC atmosphere of the 60s. It's no wonder this film won many awards. Only the best in the field could put together a masterpiece like this beauty. The soundtrack isn't the best of the classic movies but it is OK some songs are fantastic and really fit the movie perfectly.

I can't think about anything in it I would change.The casting and performances by Voight, the naive but charming hustler, and the at first unlikeable crook Hoffman are flawless. We watch what is essentially a love story as their friendship develops. Their chemistry is what makes this sizzle. Any other casting and this would not have worked so well. Hoffman understands the depth and subtleties needed to play his part and Voight's innocent charm makes the country boy believable and likeable so we root for him.The film's stylish. The genius French New Wave inspired direction works brilliantly for the film and does not seem a pretentious distraction. I liked the whole Warhol thing too. Although the film explores sexual themes and the seedy side of life, the script has the right balance to not have this overshadow the main thing - the relationship between two men.

We follow the misadventures of Joe Buck, a kid dropped off at his Granny's when he's no more than 6.  After she dies and his ""girlfriend?"" is carted away to the loony bin he decides to go to the Big Apple.  Thinking that all the 70's NY rich women will go crazy for a cowboy stud, he tries to be a hustler to NY's women.Soon the reality sets in and Joe Buck is tricked/befriended by Ratso Rizzo, a what appears to be, lifetime street person, survivor.  This is where the movie really does its magic in my view.  Building the relationship between these unlikely allies. Joe Buck, the ignorant, (stupid), red-necked, good-old-boy & Ratso the low, debased, sickly, dirty, survivor.

I only just saw it recently and never really cared to see it (because I am just not much of a fan of older movies such as this one) but was glad that I watched it. The main thing I want to say about it is just to say that the performances are wonderful. Dustin Hoffman and the other lead actor and both amazing in their roles as their characters-totally believable.The story is sort of sad about this guy who goes to New York from Texas (or another small town in a state like Texas) to be successful but he has to become a gay prostitute and act like a ""cowboy stripper"" to get gay customers interested. He had hopes of being with beautiful women but his customers are these gay guys and older women. He even ends up giving money to an old woman so she can get a cab.

278,Patsandsoxfan,Dustin Hoffman's real coming out party,8,9 February 2006,"This film is quite remarkable in that it makes a couple of practically homeless New York City delinquents into a pair of the best friends the movies have ever seen. Dustin Hoffman is hauntingly real as Ratso Rizzo, and Jon Voight is a true good 'ol southern boy. The film is really the story of how this friendship is built through a lot of bad times. When Joe Buck arrives in New York with a plan to be a hustler, and not much else, one of the first people he meets is Ratso. Ratso convinces the naïve Texan to seek out a mysterious ""manager"" and gives his advice for the mere price of $20. When the manager turns out to be a Christian zealot, not exactly what a new hustler is looking for, Buck sets out to find Ratso to, at the very least, get his money back.Eventually the two reunite and share a room in an abandoned apartment complex. They have no heat, hardly any money, and are forced to steal to get things like milk and bread. As their first winter together turns harsher and harsher in their cold apartment, Ratso's cough turns into a full-blown sickness. His only hope of survival, given that he and Joe Buck do not attempt to seek medical help, is to get to Florida. After a few breaks fall their way, they mount a bus and make it within 20 minutes of their Miami destination when Rizzo finally succumbs to whatever un-named illness he suffered from. Joe Buck is left, once again, alone in a new place. A telling sign of the strength of their friendship occurs at this time when Buck is off the bus in Miami and someone asks him where he's from. So, using his obvious southern drawl, Joe replies, ""New York."" Buck and Rizzo set out to bring their New York world to Florida, and Buck finishes it.The fascinating thing in this film, though, is the flashbacks that Joe Buck has of his previous life in Texas. The viewer is subject to many episodes of glimpses into Joe's past. We see, among other things, his childhood and his demanding mother, his old lover, and his over-bearing old boss at the diner. Joe is clearly pained by his flashbacks, and it soon becomes obvious that he's in New York to escape from this past. We're led to believe that for some reason Joe's old lover is no longer in his life. As far as I recall, we do not find out why or what happened, but the pain and longing in Buck's eyes following these flashbacks is particularly telling.The overall message of this film is that sometimes life sucks, then you find a friend, then the friend dies, and life becomes good with a newfound perspective. Joe and Ratso are not good people in this film. In fact, there aren't any good moral people in this film. Yet we see an incredible bonding of two people practically without hope. It is a story of friendship, it is a story of survival, but it's also a story of a male prostitute and a ""retard"" (Ratso's word). In the end, I did not particularly enjoy the film. My lasting impression is off how well acted this film is. Dustin Hoffman especially, because less than two years earlier he was Ben Braddock. Never have I seen an actor be able to make a shift in character this severe, and be 100% believable in both roles. The best thing I can say about it is that not once while watching Midnight Cowboy did I think to myself, ""That's Benjamin Braddock!"" So, what will I take away from this film? Mainly that Dustin Hoffman is an incredible actor. I doubt that a year from now I'll remember much else than that from this film.",Midnight Cowboy
279,danduda1,An enduring portrait of an unlikely friendship,9,24 June 2013,"Joe Buck (Jon Voight) and Rico ""Ratso"" Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman) seem unlikely chums. Maybe that's part of what makes them so memorable.Buck is a tall young man, healthy, ruggedly handsome, optimistic, naive. Rizzo is older, short, crippled, sick, usually oily, cynical. What brings them together is their struggle to survive, but also something more - their refusal to let the world beat them down no matter how hard it punches.Buck, a Texan who's a cowboy in wardrobe only, decides to shuck his small-town, dead-end existence and head for New York City. He dreams of earning fabulous riches as a male hustler to older wealthy women; he soon finds himself being hustled by almost everyone he encounters, including Rizzo.Rizzo is an embattled character fighting even for the right to cross the street (his famous line - ""I'm walkin' here!""). His ""apartment"" and scavenger lifestyle take us, as viewers, into the depths of despair. The friendship he finds with Buck brings us to the opposite end of the spectrum. The humanity Hoffman is able to bring to this role is a real tribute to the art of acting.The gritty, searing look at New York city street life this movie gives us feels too real to be entirely fictional.It's also very much emblematic of its times, 1969. There's a party that seems a cross between Andy Warhol's scene and Ken Kesey's. Rizzo and Buck's sincerity make these glitterati seem like pretentious posers.Another aspect very 1960's is the way director John Schlesinger and his team use sound and image to tell this story in ways that feel exciting and daring, especially from our modern vantage point, where, sadly, many of these techniques - such as crosscutting, montage - seem to have worked their way out of movie makers' vocabulary.Some of the ways the lead characters' realism is built are quite subtle. For instance, Rizzo's visit to his father's grave. The dialogue robs even this occasion of the dignity it should have. Buck's nightmares about a past encounter with a girl named Annie, and flashbacks about being raised by his grandmother, offer some clues as to how he winds up with this 'career choice,' while still allowing room for some mystery that feels like real life.By the movie's end Joe Buck has learned hard lessons from youthful mistakes, and suffered the pain of loss. But he has found something more valuable than the riches he dreamed of, something we feel will endure.The city becomes a 3rd lead character, determined to take everything these two have - especially their dignity. That they hang on to it may be why these characters are so enduringly popular.",Midnight Cowboy

Even Jon Voight (as a person) was depressed or not very well doing at the time of filming. (truly sorry, it is just my opinion and what I can read from his eyes). It is a masterpiece. All the details. Even the lady and her (I guess her daughter) companion siting on street bench and drinking Cola. Or the elder man in bus, O'Daniel character etc. Simply everything. That definite loneliness even though people all around. That contrast scene where the bus was full of soldiers returning to their families, all happy and Joe Buck all by himself with futile and uncertain future, nobody to hug him welcome.

282,ahab19,Only in New York,10,27 April 2014,"The heart of Midnight Cowboy is the friendship between the two main characters, Joe Buck (Jon Voight) and Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman). At the start of the film, Joe is naive young man who dreams of earning a living as a hustle in New York City in the late 1960s. His dreams of living the high life a quickly shattered and finds himself broke and destitute.Although he is swindled early on by Ratso, a hustler, the two develop a friendship that allows them to survive against the city's harsh environment. Although the late 1960s period makes this film seem dated it is beautifully acted by both leads and the conclusion is heartbreaking.Although tame by todays standards when this film came out it was very shocking and groundbreaking regarding certain scenes involving sex and drugs. However, the grittiness and the harshness that occurs on the screen is to show the viewers how difficult surviving in the city will be and that the main characters do things that they never dreamed of in order to survive.This is film is one of the all time greats.

It is a story of starting a whole new life in a strange new world, thinking that you really know what you're after, and yet finding that the life you thought you wanted doesn't want you. Joe Buck is a young ""stud"" that is trying to pursue a career in hustling the rich middle aged women of New York City. He soon finds himself homeless, broke, and beat up by urban society. He becomes a lonely ""midnight cowboy"" roaming the streets, with his manager Enrico Salvatore 'Ratso' Rizzo (played by Dustin Hoffman), searching for whatever trick he can find.Joe leaves Texas as an innocent young man with visions of the illustrious urban life. We come to find out that his emigration from Texas to New York City isn't just driven by dreams, but also by the yearning to cover up a past of abandonment and bad memories. This would become a reoccurring theme in the film, one of being left by the people who are closest to you, with most incidences being revealed in flashback form. Joe is first dumped on his grandmother by his mother and aunt (or two mothers) at a young age, and she soon became his mother figure. Joe then acquired a girlfriend as a teenager/young adult and is left by her due to some sexual assault altercations that are revealed to the viewer in graphic reoccurring nightmares and daydreams. The last flashback memory of feeling alone is a scene of Joe returning to his home after serving in the army. He is shown sitting on the steps of his grandmother's dilapidated house, and we come to find that he is just as abandoned as the house.Once Joe reaches New York City he is soon hit with the reality of his situation. Many up-scale women are not into being hustled, cowboys have come to be seen as having a homosexual connotation, and the only place he can find work as a cowboy is in a modern art exposition that is actually an abstract art trip fest. It is here he solidifies the only real work he gets as a hustler, other than beating up a gay preacher who is ""sorry for his sins"".In dealing with living in a condemned house, not knowing where your next meal is coming from, and taking care of his dying manager Rico, Joe realizes that maybe hustling and living in the city isn't for him. He is forced to discard the life he thought he was made for and travel south to Florida for Rico's sake. Once the two make it to Florida, and obtain dapper beach-life attire, Rico takes a turn for the worst and passes away, sealing the theme of abandonment in the film. Joe is left alone, and must roll with the punches of life once again.I believe this film is about the trials a traditionalist goes through while trying to assimilate themselves in a modern culture. Joe knows what New York City symbolizes, wealth and a new way of life, but he doesn't understand how it functions because he hasn't the experience to know better. This film probably played a big role in opening the countries eyes up to the new down and outers of society, and what life has come to for them. The majority of the tricks Joe found were homosexuals in the late 60s who were then only lurking in the shadows and trying to stay unnoticed by the radar of society. The explicit nature of the film brought to light the underbellies of the late 60s culture, and did it so well that even though it created and uproar with its release it still has been the only X (NC-17) rated film to ever win Best Picture by the Academy.",Midnight Cowboy
284,jrl0726,Still a magnificent film,10,27 March 2014,"Even after all these years of cultural change, this character study masterwork has lost none of it's bite and is still riveting. Perhaps the most ""complete"" film ever in terms of just about every facet of the picture is top notch. The greatest double lead performances ever by Hoffman and Voight (if the 3rd uncredited star is not considered and that is New York City). Great direction from Schlesinger and the best editing I've ever seen. Camera work and sets were superb. All the supporting roles were excellent and the music by Nilsson and Barry was perfect. Brilliant screenplay by Salt and producer Hellman deserves a lot of credit for the whole thing. The fact that this film began rated X and then R has a lot to do with any rejection received by the public or media and prevents it from being universally renowned as one of the hand full of best films ever made.

It doesn't have much of a plot, and it is quite depressing.I thought maybe it was the bleakness of the film: you can almost smell the characters and touch the grit around them, but that's not it either.I think what is so evocative about this movie and what resonates with everyone who sees it, is that it is merely about friendship and the connections that all us, even the most lowly and desperate, make in this life.It is truly a landmark in Cinema History.",Midnight Cowboy

Greater even, in my opinion, than the Rain Man. Dustin Hoffman commented that he will be remembered for 3 roles: Ratso Rizzo, Tootsie and Rain Man. Jon Voight, who played the starring role of Joe Buck, also gives an excellent performance for which he won the Academy Award for Best Actor. How ironic!The story is about Joe Buck, a male prostitute from Texas, who tries to make his way in New York City during the late 1960s. He meets Ratso Rizzo who at first, tries to take advantage of him. Later on though, they develop a strong friendship in their struggle to survive in New York. The movie contains incredible gems such as the scene when Ratso steps in front of a New York taxi cab and shouts: ""I'm walking here.""I saw the movie again in 2005, and I regret to say that it did not age well.",Midnight Cowboy

Dustin Hoffman gives the best performance so far as Ratso Rizzo. The pitch of his voice thee mannerisms everything is convincing as a New York low life who's heart is really in the right place if it was dug to past all the cynicism. Jon Voigt is perfectly cast and has a character development arc rarely seen.Director John Schelsinger's New York is accurately represented in all its grime and corruption.

I really had to pay attention, otherwise I would miss something important. It's so easy to miss the flashes of images that appear for sometimes not even a second. But despite all this madness, I've gotta say that I absolutely loved this movie. Maybe it was the complex characters that I really cared about, or just the innovative way in which the movie was shot. Or the desires of the characters that were seemingly impossible that caused a constant sense of dread to wash over me. I was crushed that Ratso never made it alive to Florida, but I was also happy that Joe had decided to live an honest live. It was the touching relationship between Joe and Ratso that I loved most - how they depended on each other, how much they learned from each other. It was heartbreaking to watch them be torn apart by tragedy, but also uplifting to know that Joe was finally living his life.",Midnight Cowboy
289,baruchandbenedict,ehhhh,5,16 January 2008,"I don't see what the big fuss is about. The acting was very good, but I felt like the characters were undeveloped and the story went nowhere. It shows glimpses of Joe Buck's past just enough to get the point across that it was troubled, but it never connects it back to his current problems, so it's really irrelevant. Similarly, I was incredibly sympathetic to Rizzo's character, but thought his ambitions of escaping to Florida were kind of arbitrary and unexplained, and drew nothing from the story when he failed to make it. The whole film was just a story with no lesson, no message, no cultural significance. TOTALLY BLUE BALLED.",Midnight Cowboy
290,idanwillenchik,Brilliant,9,19 February 2006,"Truly one of the finest American films of its era. Although somewhat dated it is still powerful and heartbreaking. Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman are simply magnetic in their honest and brave performances. A film so raw and emotionally shattering would probably not be made today unless diluted by Political Correctness. A Must See! I have seen it recently again after not having seen it for quite some time. It has been a favorite of mine for many years. I am also a great admirer of Sylvia Miles's work in this film,she gives a short but distinct performance. A well deserved winner of a Best Picture Oscar and John Schlesinger's crowning career achievement. Classic Harry Nillson song Everybody's Talking' has surprisingly not been nominated for an Academy Award.",Midnight Cowboy
291,Everton_Paul,A TRUE classic. Brilliant.,10,9 May 2006,"I find it truly depressing that this movie is not even in the top #250 of the IMDb (at the time of writing). Mind you, I wonder what the average age of the IMDb voters is! This film is one of the finest of Hollywood, although it was directed by British genius John Schlesinger - who also directed one of my favourite ever films - Marathon Man.I think in a way, this movie opened the way for the tirade of classic, daring, gritty, realistic and superbly acted/crafted movies that followed in the 1970s - an era where the frequency of truly brilliant films from Hollywood has never been higher.I won't delve into the plot (the movie is more a character study than a plot driven film anyhow), but I will say that the acting by Hoffman and Voight is incredible, the direction and photography superb, and the music wonderful ('Florida Keys' is an unforgettable melody, by genius John Barry).Too many great moments and scenes - and great dialogue! The scene where Joe Buck (Voight) meets 'Father' O'Daniel is absolutely hilarious.If you think 'Independence Day' and 'Armageddon' are cinematic masterpieces, then do yourself a favour and don't watch this movie - and moreover, don't vote on a movie you obviously are not equipped to appreciate! If on the other hand you enjoy intelligent and daring (for the time) cinema, with sensational acting performances you must watch this film.Finally, I can't believe this film was X-rated - but then again, a sign of the times it was made perhaps. It is an extremely powerful film, but I would be happy to let a 15 year old see it. Any 'sexual' scenes are always put in the context of an emotional response, you always see the effect/impact of any sexual situations on the characters involved. I view the Oscars with some suspicion, but they definitely got it right by awarding Midnight Cowboy the best movie award.Best quote .. ""I ain't a for real cowboy, but I sure am one hell of a lover!!""",Midnight Cowboy
292,puncastle,I fail to see what's so good about this film,4,15 June 2021,"Sure, the two lead actors are very good. No denying that. I also admit that the film starts off promising - a man trying to hit the big time by working as a gigolo in the Big Apple while he tries to run from his traumatic past. The friendship he develops with a man who conned him and their adventures, and mis-adventures, together is engaging and succeeds in garnering your sympathy for them. But, when the segment of the druggie's orgy came about, that's when the film really faltered. Plus, on top of that, they make the protagonist act totally out of character by killing a closeted homosexual for money to fulfill his ailing friend's wish to reach Florida. They try to further garner sympathy for the protagonist in killing the innocent (gay) man but I think it backfired terribly because now, I've just about lost all my sympathy for the protagonist. To top it all off, the protagonist's friend ends up dying before they even reach Florida, anyway. What was it all for, then?Maybe the people who really liked this are the somber, pessimistic, even nihilistic types. This is not to say movies with tragic endings are not good; I like a lot of tragic and somber films. I just like them to have a good reason for being tragic, instead of simply being ""I now face the consequences of making bad choices, please pity me.""",Midnight Cowboy
293,Jumping_Elephant,"Very Depressing, But Well Done",8,19 August 2008,"Death is always near in this film and nothing makes it seems more frightening/depressing than Dustin Hoffman's flawless acting. From the moment you are introduced to the seemingly scummy character, ""Ratso,"" to Hoffman's infamous im prompt tu line: ""I'm walkin' he'e!"" right up until his last moments, there is an ominous cloud of despair hanging over the heads of our two main characters.The second main character is Joe Buck, played by an adorable Jon Voight. (How can you NOT think he's adorable when Ratso accuses him of being a ""fag""? Joe's dumbfounded, hesitant response was: "". . . Uh. John Wayne! You think he's a faggot?"") Voight plays his character almost perfectly, too, capturing from the get-go the naivety Buck has towards ""the real world"" (something that was perhaps exacerbated by his tumultuous upbringing, shown in sporadic, nightmarish flashes throughout the movie).But as an audience, we don't just love Joe Buck because of his boyish Texan charm. He also has compassion. He manifests this feeling in awkward, confusing, and often harmful ways, but nevertheless Joe is constantly thinking of his only friend. To give examples, each time Joe pays a special visit to 42nd St., he does so to gather ""mony"" for both himself and Ratso. He could take the money and run (though where to remains a matter of speculation), but instead he buys medicine, soup, etc. for his friend (and not himself).Our sympathies are manipulated more in our main characters' favor at the end of the film, on the bus ride. Joe, being the post-adolescent that he is, finally gets ""Rico's"" name right, while monologuing in the middle of a fixed camera shot. At this point the ominous cloud hanging overhead has turned black, and we all of a sudden know that Rico will be dead by the time the camera moves over to him, despite our deepest hopes that the fixed camera angle is some sort of cruel joke; the film DOES seem peppered with pitch black humor, after all, we try to rationalize.But our rationalizing is vain. Ratso's unmoving eyes, and still sweat on his brow say it all. Then we look at his tropical shirt, and we try to feel happy for him. We say to ourselves: ""At least he made it back to Miami,"" but even this does no good. The blow is simply too great. There is an unnecessarily long black screen, and then the credits roll. Nothing relieves the terrible feeling that everything we're doing is pointless and despondent.Nonetheless, this film showcases superb acting/directing, and at least we can use that little boost to appease that depressing feeling. This is definitely a must for any cinephile.8/10",Midnight Cowboy
294,feet_15,Real and surreal,10,4 September 2003,"Dark, Gritty and unapologetic. Human nature at its most human. The brilliance of this movie is only surpassed by its unpretentious look at the frailties of our own human nature, a dark deep thrust into the realities of humanity at its most brittle and weakened state.

I can tell you that the title characters and many others in this fabulous movie were right on the money. There were very few ""normal"" folks who were regulars to Times Square at that time. Most visitors and tourists looked right through them but they were all there. Sexual perverts aka chickenhawks, Pimps, and of course the young kids coming off the buses from the heartland by the hundreds, ready to be savaged. The music, drug culture, attitudes of too many parents, and excitement of being a young, all combined to make people think they could ""make it"" in an area like TS. So very many never made it to adulthood because of the lifestyle: drugs, beatings and assaults were so common. Those who survived were damaged psychologically as well as physically. Personally, I never felt so overwhelmed in my life. While handling one case, you just knew there were dozens more happening at the same moment in time. Midnight Cowboy was just one little slice of life on 42nd Street. An excellent movie.",Midnight Cowboy
296,Flamebo07,A disturbing labyrinth that is the city,10,5 May 2002,"It a simple plot. A young Texan tries to make it as a male prostitute in New York, during the 70's. Simple. But you not only get a movie that teaches us about people, life, and what people go though to survive it, we see one of the most memorable friendships in the history of cinema. If you sit down and watch this movie shot by shot, you see more than a friendship between Ratso and Joe Buck.I'd like to mention scene in the movie. After he has the disturbing experience with O'Daniel, he starts to run after Ratso. You always see Ratso very close to Joe in that scene, but always impossible to get. It is also interesting when you see Joe tying to get to Ratso in the subway, while there are a lot of people there. But when he finally gets through everyone, no one is one the subway except Ratso, who is, again, far away from him. While he is trying to run after him, and Ratso keeps on getting farther away, who see quick shots of Joe's past, which I will mention next paragraph. And you also see some shots of Joe choking Ratso, which shows that Joe will do anything to Ratso just to hurt him. And there is an interesting music to this scene, which adds to its greatness. The music adds a sort of nauseating churning effect of an impossible labyrinth that is the city and hate is it's wall. There is no escapeI'd like to mention another scene in this movie. Where you see Joe's past experience that haunted his life, he gets so mixed up with past and present. As an example, when they take away Joe's girlfriend, first you see him running for when she is in a car in Texas. Then you see her in NYC with him running after her shirtless. When the police come to find Joe's girlfriend raped, you can see Ratso in the crowd, like he has been following him, or is an evil that he should fear. Also in that scene, you see a wrecking ball hit a building. And right after you see that, you see Joe getting hit into a fence. Again, there is something strange in that scene. You see a shot of Ratso with a broken glass bottle trying to hurt him. He has to wake. And it is so great and confusing.Joe Buck and Enrico Salvador Rizzo may as well take their place with other famous friendships as Humphrey Bogart and Claude Rains, Jack Lemmon and Tony Curtis, and Will Sampson (""Chief"" from One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest) and Jack Nicholson. But there is a difference to their friendship. Joe's is not really sure whether Ratso is person who can help him, or a person who wants to hurt him like everyone else.",Midnight Cowboy
297,Paxviri,Film bonds characters,9,4 September 2006,"What makes Midnight Cowboy into a successful movie is the way in which Joe Buck becomes bonded to Ratso Rizzo through a series of hardships that affect them both. There really aren't many glimpses of hope in this film for either character, but the hard realities that beset them both give the film its own type of optimism that these men can at least find humanity within each other.This film features Jon Voight's finest performance and probably Dustin Hoffman's as well. The rest of the cast is made up of unknowns, though it is rounded out by a fine series of character actors, including the cowpoke on the bus at the start of the film. Also, for those interested, Andy Warhol's apprentice Paul Morrissey shows up briefly during the party scene.If you haven't seen this movie, it is essential. Check it out.",Midnight Cowboy
298,djvcbd,At the top of the list,4,18 September 2011,"I saw Midnight Cowboy when it was originally released in 1969. I was 19 at the time. From the time I saw it to the present day, it has been my all time favorite movie. I've often wondered why. As an amateur film critic, I readily acknowledge that The Godfather I and II (let's forget about III) are the greatest movies I have ever seen ... and yet, Cowboy is my favorite. Why? Surely the spectacular acting by Voight and Hoffman is part of it but Brando and Pacino are equally as great (as are De Niro and Duvall) in GF I and II. The plot? What plot? Midnight Cowboy is a character study but let's review the plot anyway: wannabe cowboy moves from Texas to New York City to hustle women; fails; gravitates to the underbelly of NYC; befriends crippled homeless guy; they ultimately leave New York for Miami via bus and the homeless guy (who apparently has pneumonia) dies in transit. Compare this to the Godfather story lines and it's obviously no contest. So what is it? Why do I love this movie so much? I've come to the conclusion that it's all about its poignant presentation of the human condition and how we're drawn into it. You watch Midnight Cowboy and you feel like you're right there with Joe and Ratso, like you're living what they're living. When I watch the Godfather movies, I know I'm watching a movie ... a great movie, but a movie nonetheless. When Ratso dies on the bus, it rips Joe's heart out but it also rips the heart out of everyone watching the movie. His grief becomes our grief. It's this bonding with the characters that sets Midnight Cowboy apart from other movies ... and makes it my favorite of all time.",Midnight Cowboy

Joe Buck soon finds out that being a cowboy hustler in the Big Apple is not as easy as he had anticipated. He gets ripped off by a few people including a hygienically impaired small time con man named Ratso Rizzo (Dustin Hoffman). Ratso dreams of going to Florida where he feels that he will be respected and loved unlike his current condition in New York where he is treated like trash and has to steal whatever he can get just to get by. These two outcasts become friends and together struggle through the hardships that face them everyday.Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman deliver absolutely phenomenal performances. They were born to play these characters. They make you feel like your right beside them walking down the streets of New York. Director John Schlesinger uses amazing images to show Joe's past and what is going on inside Joe's head.

At that moment I realised what a truly great actor Hoffman is. His portrayal of Ratzo is stunning.No less stunning is Jon Voights portrayal of Jo Buck, the cowboy dreamer. Eventually, the harsh realities of life on the streets of New York kill his alter ego, and we later see Jo throwing his cowboy clobber into the trash.The film is loaded with symbolism. For example, before Jo Buck beats one of his tricks and stuffs a telephone in his mouth we witness him in the penny arcade shooting cowboy targets with a rifle.What is the film about?

So, when I saw it again now in '07, I knew what to expect & the sobs were ready & primed as their required moment approached. Thankfully this time I was at home.What I hadn't remembered from my youthful viewing- or perhaps hadn't noticed because of it, was the technical brilliance of this movie. The use of flashbacks which tell so much story without resorting to dialogue. The camera work which seemed to place the viewer, together with the characters in the scene. Think of the opening when Joe is crossing the street to the diner, the camera pans behind the woman & child sitting on a bench in the foreground, framing the street scene. The story itself, & the characters - seedy, sad & brutally real. It is very touching to be drawn so closely into a human drama such as this with people most of us would likely spurn. Then again, Joe & Ratso could be any of us. Must have been '70 when I saw it. I recall that upon leaving the theatre I was impelled to find the company of friends.

Actors cast out of type, Hollywood blacklisted writer, non-studio driven, x rated Oscar winner with (at that time) extremely tabu subject matters are just some of the reasons why the status of Midnight Cowboy should be elevated prior to watching. Essentially a buddy film, its true genre is disguised in the dark and seedy reality of New York in the late 60's where 2 men down on their luck, form a symbiotic friendship. Joe Buck is a naive dishwasher who travels to New York to seek his fortune as a hustler, but soon finds the streets are not paved with gold. Conned out of $20 by street crook Enrico 'Ratso' Rizzo, Joe becomes homeless as he is unable to pay his hotel bill, until he finally catches up with 'Ratso' the next day. Joe accepts the offer of help and the two form a business relationship. The events of their past unfold while Joe and 'Ratso' decide to work towards a brighter future in Miami. During this time, 'Ratso' is becoming increasingly sick, so Joe takes drastic measures to secure the money needed for their bus tickets. In a touching and tragic end we see them both make it out of New York although 'Ratso' passes away before his dream of paradise is realised.

However I found myself wondering how Joe Buck could be so naive as to get himself in the position he got in. His character was rather goofy too.I did like this movie overall though. I think I had certain expectation going in and it turned out to be a little different than I expected.The plot is amusing at first then starts down a dark alley and ends... well it ends. I suppose Joe Buck's naivety are part of his character and help make the movie what it is. Ratso is definitely a different type that is worn down by being sick and poor in the big city life.**Slight Spoiler***The interplay between these two characters is rather interesting. The two most unlikely people to be friends. Yet they make great friends toward the end you wonder how they ever lived without each other.I really felt for both characters. I was hoping Joe Buck would wise up a little and that Ratso would get some medical attention. Despite both characters having qualities that annoyed me I wanted them to prevail. The way that their humanity was shown was rather compelling.**End Slight Spoiler**The movie progresses at a nice pace. The climatic ending was not what I thought it's be. However it rather tied up the movie nicely and left me with a feeling of completion.The historical fact that this was rated X in the 60s was interesting to me. Just to note how nowadays it isn't a racy as it was then, a reflection on society's standards.I would recommend this movie.

307,n1cl0las,Subjectively : One of my favourite films of all time; Objectively : one of the best films of all time,10,21 October 2008,"If you're on its IMDb page you've probably heard a lot about ""Midnight Cowboy"", and I hope to say a bit more about it than its re-release tag line that ""everything you've heard about Midnight Cowboy is true"".Firstly, the driving force of the film comes from its two protagonists, their wonderful characters astonishingly acted by Voight and Hoffman. If you're an actor who appreciates fine performances and perhaps wants to learn from some of the masters of the profession look no further than Midnight Cowboy -- this is not to say that Voight and Hoffman's performances are THE best of all time, but perhaps no other film has showcased such quality performances in such a saturated way.Joe Buck (Voight) is the charming, good looking blue eyed 'cowboy' from Texas. He is confident, charismatic and charming but helplessly naive. Enrico 'Ratso' Rizzo is in many ways opposite to Joe, he is sickly, crippled and has none of the sexual confidence of Joe, yet these two men share a friendship that will follow you the rest of your life.Roger Ebert said of Midnight Cowboy that people we've forgotten the the off-filming style, and remembered the purity of the central characters and the Voight and Hoffman performances, which brings me onto the only criticism of the film, the filming style. The film frequently uses very dated (though fashionable at the time) flash backs and bizarre dream sequences that seem to break the general bleak atmosphere of the film, however these are soon forgotten and does not warrant deducting a star from the overall score as compared to the fine narrative, setting and performances it is trivial.Also on the topic of it being dated, the film is about a time when New York was a completely different to the rich man's playground it has now become. In this sense yes the film has dated but that phrase seems to always imply a negative connotation, a more fitting way to describe it is to call it a time capsule, and it really, truly is.But the themes : loneliness, friendship, camaraderie and the false hope of the horizon will ring true for eternity.",Midnight Cowboy

This film is about a cowboy who wants to get ""some"" and get money for it, quite sick but acceptable. The unacceptable is that when that guys' times get hard, he starts to sell himself to boys, it's like he'll do everything for money. And it's very disturbing to see him do that, 'cause the guy is so positive and happy all the time, you can really relate to him, but hard to think he really is a disgusting fellow. It is also implied that he was raped once.
A really confusing thing is that the music in the film is so happy, but movie itself is not- really confusing. Mabye it wanted to show the point of view of the cowboy, happy all the time.
The warmest part is the friendship between the main characters, Cowboy and Ratso. Although they both didn't get along well in the beginning, but they ended up only having each other, quite emotional.
The directing, editing and acting in this film is amazing, really influencal.
This movie deserves R rating, if you can you should see it. It's very eye opening and very well made. It was quite disgusting, but overall a good movie.",Midnight Cowboy
310,camadon,Brilliant counter-culture film,8,18 February 2006,"Midnight Cowboy opens with a run down Drive In theater with the voice-over of the main character Joe Buck (Jon Voight) singing in the shower. He is singing a cowboy song, the very thing he strives to be. Joe picks up his humdrum life living in Texas and moves it to New York City with the dream of lots of women, and even more money. He dresses as the epitome of the cowboy, but in a cartoonish fashion, not even his friends take him seriously. He begins his journey on the bus to NYC and we can quickly see how diluted Joe is through his interactions with the other passengers. This is primarily a story of Joe's realization of the harsh realities of the real world.He starts off as a very naïve southerner thinking he can make it in NYC just on his good looks. He has no other reason to think otherwise, as they proved helpful in the past; we learn this from the many flashbacks he has. In the beginning the flashbacks are filmed in a way that portrays them as being somewhat whimsical. They are hazy and the voices sound as if they are coming from a great distance, as they are, they are coming out of his past. However, as Joe delves deeper and deeper into the reality of the harsh atmosphere of NYC we see more of his past, which is no longer whimsical but gritty, filmed in black and white with rapid editing to portray the cruel nature of the past events. This is especially seen in the flashback of him and his girlfriend being assaulted, and her being raped. In one of these flashbacks we see a building being torn down brick by brick. This mirrors the way in which Joe himself is falling apart; the naiveté that he once carried is falling off of him. He and Ratso (Dustin Hoffman) are living in squalor, and barely able to get food to eat; Joe is realizing he cannot live off of his looks, that there is a gritty underbelly of New York that he didn't envision. His subconscious mirrors the way in which his real life is panning out.Ratso is also serves as a kind of mirror to Joe, but in an opposite way; Ratso is Joe's foil. Joe is a handsome, strong man who, for the most part, has a good outward appearance. Ratso, on the other hand, from the very first time we see him sitting next to Joe in the bar we can tell he is the opposite. He is short, dark, and always coated with a sheen of sweat. He understands how the world works, that it is unforgiving, and sometimes no matter how hard you try you will fail; just as his father did. They are living in the same world, the same apartment even, but they understand things on a completely different level.The theme of alienation, one that is common of this era, is very apparent in this film. Neither Joe nor Ratso fit into the culture surrounding them. Joe feels trapped in Texas and moves to NYC where he is still very much an outsider. Ratso, living in the cold of NYC, wishes to move to sunny Florida where he thinks he will be able to find a good life. Even though this is his ideal, in the fantasy we get from Ratso's perspective, it is apparent that he knows he will never really fit into society. In said fantasy he is turned on by the people living around him, he is yet again an outsider, alienated from society.It is not until the end that the gap between Joe and Ratso begins to narrow. Joe resorts to violence; he takes on the mentality of this city in order to get money to fund a means of escape for Florida for himself and Ratso. On the journey we see Joe coming out of a store not wearing the cowboy clothes that he is never without in the rest of the film. He is dressed as someone who looks like they are headed to Florida for vacation. He dresses Ratso the same way; he tires to make them fit into the new society they are entering, but it is to no avail. Upon Ratso's death on the bus, their fellow passengers once again look them upon as outsiders. Even in this new culture they have entered, they cannot escape the alienation they have met at every turn in this film. Despite the Ratso's death, and Joe's continued alienation, the film ends with the hope that Joe can take his new knowledge of how the world works and create a better life than he would have had as a hustler in NYC. Midnight Cowboy is an excellent film portraying the harsh reality of society, and alienation, with stellar performances by both Voight and Hoffman.",Midnight Cowboy
311,jkyller,Don't Mess with Texas,9,17 February 2006,"Midnight Cowboy is the story of a naive lad from Texas who is out of touch with reality and believes that he is more qualified for the task at hand than he really is. Apparently the Lone Star State has this effect on many of its young studs. The comment by Joe Buck at the beginning of the film, ""I only get car sick on boats,"" sounds like it is right out of the logic structure of our present day famous cowboy. I am being facetious, but a comparison between King George and Joe Buck can be very interesting ideologically. The film does a great job of showing the exuberant Texan creating a self image and confidence that breaks down when taken out of the dream world and put into the reality we all inhabit. The use of mirrors in the film, especially when Joe makes the quick turns at his reflection, hammers home the self indulgent fixation he has. The footage in Texas also support this character trait because they show how isolated the small town he comes from is. It is not necessarily saying anything bad about small town life, but it does show the danger of disillusionment that easily manifests itself in the desert. The only contact that Joe apparently has with society outside of his home town is from a small transistor radio. When his bus is finally within close enough range to pick up stations from New York City, he tunes into a station that tells him exactly what he wants to hear: that all the girls are just waiting for this cowboy to show them what a real man is. This is an interesting comment on mass media in its own right, but Joe is not merely corrupted by false promises coming across the air ways. He has already created some perversion of reality within which he will be able self-actualize according to his created persona. This is the ideological characteristic of the far right in today's political discourse. Everything that was ever needed to be known about the real world is embodied in the microcosm of small town Texas and New York City is full of queers.The other cinematic technique that plays on the discord between ideal dream world and reality are the flashbacks and flash forwards, so to speak. The flashbacks that are the most interesting are the ones where Joe is with his old girlfriend. At the beginning of the film, we see ""Crazy Anne Loves Joe Buck"" on a water tower at the edge of town from the bus window that is exporting Joe. All of the flashbacks at the beginning of the film suggest that this relationship had a positive effect on Joe. However, as the film progresses and the optimism of Joe disintegrates, the true nature of his memory shows itself. There was an incident that was really traumatic, where Joe's girlfriend was raped and she was forced to believe that Joe did it. (i.e., ""He was the only one!"") The incident is not very clear, but it gives you the idea of how that memory is and has been affecting Joe. The fact that his memory is changing over time suggest the malleability of memory. When Joe has self-confidence, he is able to shape his memory to support his idea of self. This is a concept as American as apple pie; allowing history to tell us what we want to hear.",Midnight Cowboy

313,layne-d-hansen,Pleasantly Surprised,9,7 December 2006,"I was going through a list of Oscar winners and was surprised to see that this film beat Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid for best picture in 1969. After actually seeing it, however, I'm not surprised anymore. It was way ahead of its time in regards to its style, cinematography, and use of flashback to help develop Joe Buck's character.The most amazing thing to me is the depth of Joe Buck's character in such a short movie. I think Voight captured the naivete and the viciousness-when-provoked. The two scenes that really caught me were after he gets the blowjob in the theater and when the older man solicits him. I think when he looks in the mirror he's trying to see if it's really him that has done- or is about to do- something terrible.I think it was a brilliant decision by Hoffman to take this role. Otherwise he may have been typecast after the Graduate. Anyway, this considered an all-time great for a reason.",Midnight Cowboy

315,nobdvd,This is the best movie ever made,10,11 January 2006,"I remember being disappointed at not being old enough to see this movie when it was first released. I would have to wait another 11 years to see it on video,but it was worth the wait.No movie I have seen since has captured the loneliness and dependence of two souls in an cold city. Shot in New York it could have easily have been Toronto or even Minneapolis anyplace the temperature dips below freezing. I felt cold when Ratso and Joe Buck were cold. When they were hungry I felt the pangs as well. Dustin Hoffman & Jon Voight inhabited the characters and at once made we want to help and ""walk faster"". The movie perfectly snaps a shot of the late sixties and preserves the psychedelia and pace. This is a must see for anyone who claims to love movies",Midnight Cowboy
316,colvinis,a masterpiece of cinema,10,16 May 2006,"First I would like to say how great this. It is astounding and sometimes shocking. And to say the least I'm 11 years old and this is my favorite movie, I can definitely stand a boring film, but this is anything but boring. It is like a trip through humanity. Its stark realism shows through this monumental masterpiece. It is a heart wrenching tale of two down and outers (VOIGHT AND Hoffman) who build a mutual friendship. Joe Buck (VOIGHT) a naive Texan stud comes to New York to make it rich by entertaining women. Soon he meets Rico 'RATSO' Rizzo (HOFFMAN), who is a poor man barely being able to pay rent. Ratso becomes Joe's 'manager' but soon both men can't find Joe a job which results in stealing food. As they try and survive on the streets of New York we realize how tough it is. They can't get Joe a girl until they meet a lady at a party. Joe makes some money and soon Joe takes Ratso on a Ratso's dream spot, Florida. The final five minutes are heart breaking yet some of the greatest moments in the film. From MIDNIGHT COWBOY we get a stark and sometimes disturbing urban view on life.",Midnight Cowboy
317,neilrob1,loneliness and friendship in the big bad world,10,13 February 2006,"I never get tired of seeing the film, and even though I haven't seen if for a while, it remains burnt into my memory like no other. It easily remains Voight's finest hour and Hoffman never got into character as deep as this one. If you've ever gone to the city from a small town and been amazed at how much there is to take in and understand and be confused by, then you will relate to this film. Themes of starting a better life, running away from your past, putting all your dreams into one plan, hoping that a change of scene means a change of mind, the need for human contact no matter how hard you think you can do without it, the basic need to communicate with people. Of course if you have no heart or are as emotional as a dry mushroom, you will remain untouched, but maybe you will be able to appreciate it on a more cinematic level. Like everything to do with any kind of ""art"", if there is no emotional content and communication and telling of people's lives, no feeling, no real people, then I have no interest in it (e.g. the Coens' time pieces). That's why I love this film. Whoever you relate to - Voight ? Hoffman ? The old man who longs for company ? - if you have a beating heart, this will get you. By the way, doesn't the theme tune leave a lump in your throat?",Midnight Cowboy
318,jampot,a moving story...,9,4 June 1999,"Is this a bio-pic of two minor characters surrounding the warholian crowd at Max's Kansas Bar in NY at the end of the 1970's? If so then it definitely adds to the note-worthiness of this excellent film. For a predecessor to Scorsese's Mean Streets it definitely shows the meanness of the streets where two drop-outs with dreams live. If you want romance then Joe Buck is a romantic; if you want a character who deserving of luck, who could be more unlucky than Ratso Rizzo. This film engages the emotions of the viewer and yet doesn't allow itself to become a victim to them: when the two reach for their dream and come so close, the honesty of the final scene is truly moving.",Midnight Cowboy

322,caleb_bohen604,"Finest of New Hollywood, Schlesinger's Masterpiece Hoffman at his best",10,3 September 2013,"This film effectively ignited my spark of passion for film and the New Hollywood cinematic era in general, the plot revolves around a small time texan man striving for more fulfillment than his mediocre life cleaning dishes in the local diner offers. He decides to head for New york in search of sexual and financial satisfaction but his ambitions don't quite flourish as he expects.Hoffmans Fastidious approach to landing this role is echoed throughout every scene, his plausibility as Enrico Rizzo Salvatore the New york Hustler with ailing health is impossible to deny and his improvisational skills lead to one of the most iconic scenes and most famous lines of dialogue in Hollywood's history, ""Im walking here!, ya son ova bitch!"" as an actual New York cabby unknowingly enters an improvised on location NY city film set nearly knocking both Jon Voight and Hoffman over.This really is the one of the ultimate buddy films, the plot and depth of character really allows the audience to connect with both characters, their desperation and ultimately their growing dependence on each other in such inhospitable surroundings as echoed with Joe Buck's entrance to New York as he witnesses the drunk/dying man led on the pavement, ignored as if another piece of gum on the sidewalk.Many of the edits in it such as Bucks dream sequences in particular his theoretical Ratso chase scene is especially captivating echoing the experimental edits of Antonini's earlier classics of the 1950's.The plot doesn't fall to fowl of the James Leo Herlithy's Book with a brilliant reworking by veteran ex blacklisted screenwriter Waldo Salt, one of the finest most innovative screenwriters of his time, reworking the gangster genre to a comedy hybrid, a good 30 years before the Sopranos or Analyse this/that to very comic effect starring a very young De Niro in a Bupkipesque role of inexplicable comic scenes. Further working on Coming Home a brilliant early anti Vietnam film by Hippy of Hollywood Hal Ashby, (fantastic soundtrack too as all of Ashbys films)Serpico which speaks for itself with Lumet ( king of NY directors in my eyes) and Schlenslingers later more condemning film, Day Of the Locust, 1975.....

323,joeblooso,"Terrible - Another ""classic"" that may have been good at one time - like using clay tablets for writing.",1,15 December 2006,"I logged on to IMDb and created this account for the sole purpose of reviewing this movie.Awful. Horrible. What a waste of time.I have now seen 4 or 5 movies from the 10 year time period around this movie. They are all described as ""classics"". Like the French Connection (which was bad, but not horrible).This movie bored me to anger. Don't let the claims that this was ""fine acting"" or ""exploring a poignant issue"" fool you.The story stunk and the acting was hammy and overboard. Hoffman was his usual overacting, nasal annoying self. I think he'll be remembered as an overrated actor some day, who always took a character and made it into a caricature.Voight ""acted great"" if by that we mean he played the role of an annoying, too dumb to be believable guy.POTENTIAL SPOILER STARTS HERE.Perhaps this movie was considered Oscar worthy at the time because it had gay scenes in it. Perhaps it was considered Oscar worthy because it jumped all over the place, had no story, and involved generally ignored or disregarded topics. Look! How novel! There's no discernible story, just two guys randomly doing stupid stuff. Look! There're a bunch of flashbacks! Wow! Images of old girlfriend, sodomy, rape, grandma giving him an enema, grandma catching him having sex with a girl, girl saying ""you're the only one"" 100 times. Wow! That probably has some deep meaning - I'm just too stupid to understand it. Maybe if I watch the movie 4 or 5 times then the incoherent garbage will make some more sense.This movie was annoying. The story was nonexistent, the acting was bad, the scenes were so stupid so as to be unbelievable, and the ending so predictable so as to be an anti-climax.I wasted almost 2 hours of my life on this garbage, but I solidified two lessons in my head about this . . .1) The next time I am 1 hour into a movie that is considered ""great"" and it's been garbage to that point, I am turning it off. There have been so many that I have watched to see if the last 1/2 reveals something that caused the high rating or Oscar or whatever. But! But it never does! It always gets worse. And the really really bad movies run out to 2.5 hours or more, as if length can compensate for lack of quality.2) I am done watching ""classics"" that were made after the Humprey Bogart, Place in the Sun era of movies and before I started watching movies in the late 70s.3) If you watch this crap, don't be baited in. Don't review it as if you were watching it in 1969. That's like reviewing the game ""pong"" that came out on telestar in the late 70s, you know, with the two paddles and the ball, and giving it an 8 because it was great for its time. Pong stunk at the time, just like Midnight Cowboy.",Midnight Cowboy
324,BostonFlash,One of my all-time favorites,10,11 October 2015,"This is one of the half-dozen films that left me shaken upon leaving the theater where I saw it in 1969 (at the age of 19). It has all the bizarreness and griminess that was New York in the late '60s, which was pretty frightening to a sheltered Brooklyn teenager. The direction and cinematography were highly unusual for that time, and the use of montages and cuts (and the trippy shots of the Warholesque party) made the film even more disorienting. The film never sags and holds your attention throughout, and the through line of the plot -- the friendship between Rizzo and Joe Buck -- has about as much emotional impact as anything else I've ever seen. Equally of interest is the psychological content of the flashbacks that show how Joe became the way he is. The star performances are outstanding -- hard to see how either of them could lose to John Wayne -- and the sheer variety of supporting actor performances is incredible. A fully realized, three-dimensional film that probably couldn't find backers today.",Midnight Cowboy
325,DilettanteMom,This is the least-enjoyable film-watching experience I have ever had.,1,16 January 2015,"If Midnight Cowboy hadn't beaten Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid for the Best Picture Oscar, I'd probably just hate it a lot, and forget about it. But it did, and it keeps showing up on people's lists of great ""not-to-be-missed"" movies. I know there must have been worse movies made, but I haven't seen them. I usually enjoy movies, even ones that other people find fault with. I think it's possible for a film to have many flaws and still be worth my time. It is certainly possible for a movie to have disturbing images, or leave me unsettled, and still be worth my time. Midnight Cowboy made me feel bad about being a member of the human race. It made me want to ask for my money back, even though I watched it for free when my boyfriend worked at a video store. Midnight Cowboy is what will be playing on every screen in Hell, in the unlikely event that I have been wrong all along about the loving nature of God.",Midnight Cowboy
326,murdersherote,"Well done film, but very depressing!!",8,31 October 2009,"The film The Midnight Cowboy stars Dustin Hoffman who plays Ratso a crippled, homeless man trying to survive on the streets of NY City and Jon Voight , a young stud Joe Buck who moves from Texas to NY with hopes of becoming a successful prostitute. The two men cross paths and begin forming a strange relationship. The pair end up desperate to survive on the dreary and dark streets of NY.This film is a love story and the story is focused on the complex relationship between Ratso and Joe Buck. The relationship starts off rocky when Ratso betrays Joe Bucks trust but somehow they meet again and end up living together. Their main goal is to become wealthy and move to Florida. They make several attempts at getting Joe Buck some ""jobs"" but none of them are ever really successful and they struggle quite hard in the city.This film reminded me a lot of another film where Dustin Hoffman plays a man with Autism, Rainman. Not just because it has Dustin Hoffman in the film but because it is much like another love story between two men, they struggle in their differences but in the end they do fall in love with each other. They start out on the rocks these relationships. In the end of the films you can see their love over powers the disability of the crippled man. The films are quite similar in those aspects.Midnight Cowboy's director John Schelsinger does a great job of using different effects in the film to make it look very dingy, dark, mysterious and even in some scenes pretty trippy. He uses several flash backs, uses some black and white in the film and very good lighting techniques. There are several scenes in an abandoned building they lived in that used just candle light for lighting as they of course didn't have electricity. The director did a great job of making this film look so real, you felt as if this was really happening and like you were there with them. There is a scene where the characters go to a party that uses several special effects to make you feel like you are in the characters head while they are on drugs.Throughout my viewing of the film I wasn't quite sure what the theme of this film was. I thought maybe it was a coming of age story focusing on the character Joe Buck, and then I thought maybe it was a film focusing on the struggle for human dignity yet again focusing on the character Joe Buck. But as the relationship between Ratso and Joe Buck grew and as I saw Joe Buck become obsessed with getting Ratso to Florida in order to heal him from his sickness, I realized this was a love story and a tragic one at that.",Midnight Cowboy
327,genevivalang,Midnight's meaning to me,10,6 February 2010,"This superb and sad movie expresses the disconnected soul of modern man culminating in the 1960s. ""God is dead"" and the soul is left to wander the depraved streets of NYC looking for a way to survive. But men still have their dreams, even if those dreams are no greater than to be successful Miami pimps or hustlers, and come in from the cold. In a world where there is no morality and no one can be trusted, imperfect human beings still find each other and struggle to survive. Somewhere along this dark, lonely, unglamorous path, a thing called love happens. Not the amorous love of heterosexuals or homosexuals but the love of one human being for another. The Texas hustler displays something sorely lacking in many people's lives: loyalty, and compassion, even though he is capable of violence and great force in order to keep his friend alive. The old expression (probably coined by the old themselves) is very apt: ""Life is the thing that happens when you are on your way to something entirely different,"" or ""Life is what happens while you are thinking about doing something else entirely."" Will Dustin Hoffman's character, Ratso die on his way to Miami in the same way that every man dies on his way to the corner drug store, the bath room, his next big project, or to some other place entirely? Or will he find a reprieve? We know the answer to these kinds of things innately whether we think about them or not, and that is why the culminating and moving scenes of this film still take your breath away. In a ""soul-less universe"" the world still goes its merry way, whether we are sick or well, rich or poor... but somehow we still have soul. There is a shot during the film that hints at Ratso's future or perhaps his past. A shot of a Times Square symbol of the sun with dazzling lights is followed by the X in the window of the tenement apartment. The sun has been or will be X'ed out, the man has not made it to his place in the sun and we wonder if he will make it to the sun in Miami; he has already been crossed out, rejected, X'ed out of the sunny life by poverty,physical handicap, disfranchisement. Historically and cosmically, the sun has been used as the symbol of one's vitality and life. The X tells us that this man has lost his vitality and will lose his life. But will he? Is it a way of preparing us for a blow in the same way that a dream or premonition prepares us for a dramatic turn of events, or has the blow already been made? Dustin Hoffman and Jon Voight did a magnificent job. I first saw this film at the age of 13, over forty years ago, and all I had remembered about it was the ending and the theme of loneliness, and that it had made me cry. (But how on earth did I get into that film if it was rated X? That is now a mystery to me.) Now, after 40 years, I have just watched this film again and been even more moved the second time round, knowing much more about life, about illness and death, poverty of both the soul and the wallet, and about roads taken to dreams that never manifest. Love is more important than the dreams. That's what our young hearts finally find out before we die. Or at least that's what we hope, for ""dreams are as fleeting as the northern midnight wind.""",Midnight Cowboy

It does not take Buck long too realize the cold harsh reality of the big city and things are not only as easy as they initially appear, it is here that he happens upon a street smart con man Ricco (Ratso) Rizzo (played by Dustin Hoffman) who offers to take Buck under his wing and help manage his one man endeavor of getting the entire female (or possibly male) population of New York to pay for his unique and well endowed services.The backdrop for this John Schlesinger film is New York City during the late sixties; a period when Times Square was at it worst and the seedy under life was most prevalent. It is here that the basic theme of the story evolves as Buck and Ratso begin to develop a co-dependent relationship as Buck receives tutelage and guidance from Ratso while continuing to only find disappointment after disappointment. Schlesinger does a wonderful job of creating a compelling story about companionship utilizing unique cinema graphic and sound editing techniques (like changing color shots to black and white) including reflective camera angles, montages and flashback scenes.As there relationship continues develop and their feeling for one another evolve viewers may begin to question how deep that affection for one another goes. Though this is never actually witnessed on film (unlike the film Brokeback Mountain) a case could be made that the relational ship comparisons' do exist. While their internal and external conflicts continue Ratso and Buck come to terms with the fact that success can not be had in New York City (and that a change of climate would do wonders for Ratso failing health) they decide that their venture is much better off in Florida.Despite the harsh cinematic qualities and graphic nature of the film both main actors deliver award winning performances that allow the underlying theme to be driven home, a message of caring and compassion between two individuals so different from the other but yet in need of the same thing, Love.",Midnight Cowboy

I was too young to watch it when it was originally released, and only saw it for the first time a couple of years ago, but it has absolutely stood the test of time, and I have watched it several times since. Everything about this film is brilliant, from the poignant performances from Voight and Hoffman (even though I know this movie well, I still find myself welling up every time Voight flashes one of his innocently pained looks, or Hoffman coughs in his sickly and ominous way) to the stunning cinematography and superbly edited dream sequences.

""joe buck"" is an amazingly stable character once the viewer realizes his past was plagued by sexual abuse. as for Rizzo's past, one can only wonder.i'm usually one who cries at the drop of a hat, but amazingly, i found myself so consumed by the artistry of this film that i forgot to shed a tear. a raw film, without question, but i'm not sure i'd call it depressing. maybe because i live in NYC? the integration of black & white sequences along with drug-like dream flashbacks are true genius and add to the dramatic & realistic portrait of the life Voight & Hoffman are forced to lead. there's a somewhat ""B"" quality to the film & by today's standards, it seems unlikely that it would have won an Oscar but the acting is of the highest standards. even that of Sylvia Myles - albeit only 5 minutes in duration. i find her scene to be the most disturbing portion of the film.i read another user's comment about the Warhol-esquire party scene being dragged out & somewhat irrelevant but i strongly disagree. it's highly relevant to the time period and sets the stage for Jon Voight's encounter with Brenda Vaquero - the most ""sane"" character that we meet in this film. also, for you underground buffs, there are cameos here by Viva & Paul Morrissey, both of Warhol fame.on a completely irrelevant note, Angelina Jolie is the perfect picture of her father as a young man.i hesitate to say more since i may spoil it for you so let's summarize by saying ""just go rent it.""",Midnight Cowboy
333,Jacksterboy,Friendship at its best,10,6 April 2006,"Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman play their hearts out as individuals who became outcasts and find an everlasting friendship in the slums of New York. This movie deserved the Oscar for Best Picture in 1969. It is the first and only ""X"" rated movie to get the prize. This movie has changed the way we feel about friendship and the many twists and turns that can occur in a friendship. Voight's performance as the naive Joe Buck makes you believe he can go anywhere. But Hoffman's performance as Ratzo Rizzo is one for the ages. Hoffman transforms into a character that is entirely believable. He makes you feel pity for him. The ending will show you that everybody has a dream. It just might not be in your reach. A+",Midnight Cowboy
334,pianoronni37,Never have I loved a movie more...,10,16 September 2005,"I am a 23 year old female college student, studying American Literature. This movie broke my heart the very first time I saw it, and every time since. I cry every time I see it- I weep for Rizzo, I weep for Joe Buck, I weep for the people that are the slum of society, that no one notices, but they are a part of this world too. This movie from 1969 has stood the test of time beautifully, portraying the world as it is seen through a young man's eyes- desolate and trying. For every young person who has never seen this movie- I eagerly suggest you watch it. Be prepared- this is the most disturbing movie I've ever seen, yet it is the most moving movie I've ever witnessed. The youth of America needs to experience this movie, to experience what life is like for 30% of the population, and to notice and understand the trials that the poor men and women of this country go through. Thank you Dustin Hoffman, Jon Voigt, and John Schlesinger. Your work has forever moved me.",Midnight Cowboy

336,radbid1972,Depressing,5,8 September 2014,"I saw Midnight Cowboy in 1969 when I was 21. I liked it a lot then and thought it was insightful and meaningful. I saw it today for the first time since then, uncut and without commercials. Now it's a depressing film about losers to me. I had to FF thru the scene with Barnard Hughes, just too ugly for me now. Still had some humor and seeing Brenda Vaccaro in her prime was nice. And of course it would barely be rated R now as opposed to the X rating it had. NYC was a real cesspool then and I just didn't need to be reminded of it. Always thought my kids (now in their 30s) might enjoy it, but I now know they wouldn't. Anyway, kinda glad I did see it again, just to get it out of my system.",Midnight Cowboy
337,bradleyluke-90798,Everybody's Talkin' About It,10,16 January 2018,"Midnight Cowboy is no easy pill to swallow. On the surface it is a brutal and unforgiving portrait of what happens to those who dare to follow their dreams and wind up fruitless. But what lies underneath is a beautiful tale of an unlikely friendship.Jon Voight plays Joe Buck, an ambitious young Texan who decides to quit his menial job as a dishwasher to pursue fortune in New York City. However upon arrival he quickly discovers that the Big Apple isn't the land of opportunity he thought it was. All is not lost for Joe however as he finds companionship and a home in the form of a seedy conman named Enrico ""Ratso"" Rizzo who is played by Dustin Hoffman.The movie details Buck's odyssey from Texas to New York and we as the audience are with him every step of the way. Voight manages to embody lost youth in his haunting portrayal of Buck. Hoffman's performance is incredible and one of his very best. His transformation from playing Benjamin Braddock in The Graduate to playing Rizzo is nothing short of miraculous. The development of the friendship which the movie revolves around is subtle and completely natural. Hoffman and Voight have an on screen chemistry which-nearly 50 years later-has yet to be replicated.In the backdrop of this dynamic lie very interesting themes. One of which is the theme of idealistic dreams. While Buck thinks New York is the answer to his problems, Rizzo thinks Florida is the answer to his. In this way the screenwriter Waldo Salt cleverly taps into a subject that still lingers today; the idea that the answer to our problems lies in exotic places. Midnight Cowboy is-in its own peculiar and understated manner-leading an attack on 1960s consumerism and the superficial mindsets that formed with it.Midnight Cowboy is my favourite movie of all time and I've often wondered why that is the case. After much contemplation I have come to the conclusion that it is because it deals with a subject matter I hold dear in a harsh and most importantly; very *real* way. Friendship is a concept that I and I think most people hold in high esteem and this movie explores that concept like no other. Make no mistake about it, I don't think the featured characters were good people. However after watching their trials and tribulations and seeing them at their most vulnerable and most humane, it's difficult not to care for them.I knew this movie was special when I smiled at the characters. But not because they did something amusing; because they were smiling too.",Midnight Cowboy
338,hanazdad2,One of the Best of all Time,9,15 June 2007,"I loved the movie ""Midnight Cowboy"" from the first time I saw it which was about a half dozen years after it was released. I was too young for an X rated movie when it came out. I have not seen this movie in many years but its visual stimulation has burned in my mind for a decade or more. The movie made both Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman both stars in my mind . And stars they were in this film, I never saw a more realistic sorry excuse for a New York rat street bum then Hoffman. You could feel the charisma of his character, you would feel dirty just watching his street wise persona. He was amazing. He played so well opposite Jon Voight. The out of place rural cowboy Joe Buck. He just reeked of out of his atmosphere first time in a big city hick. I have never ever seen Jon Voight in a film where I enjoyed his role as much as I did in this movie. The seedy sets of the streets of New York were so realistic just as I described with Hoffman they would make you feel like trying to brush off the filth that came off the screen. In the winter cold the characters affected you so much that you would actually button your coat as if you were there on the screen freezing with them. The climatic ending scenes were so well acted if Hoffman never made another film, I would say he was still one of the best actors ever in the business. Beautifully filmed, acted, directed and edited, absolutely beautiful. This is definitely one of the best movies of that decade and really one of the best movies I have ever seen. Heart breaking at times, often not the easiest movie to see, but one of the best movies ever made.",Midnight Cowboy
339,poisedrocks,Bar Scene,6,5 August 2018,"Where was the bar scene filmed at? Wondering if the place is still there? In the screenplay the bar is called Everett's and on another review site someone said it was called Club 45 but didn't state an address. The bar scene was right before the ""i'm walkin here"" scene.",Midnight Cowboy
340,bigsteve-21844,Rated X,10,18 August 2018,This movie was rated X when it came out in 1969. I double-dated with a friend and we took our girlfriends to see this movie. Since it was an X rated movie my girlfriend had to tell her parents we were going to see a Disney movie. I don't know how long this movie stayed with an X rating but to this day almost 50 years later my girlfriend never told her parents the truth about seeing this movie.,Midnight Cowboy
