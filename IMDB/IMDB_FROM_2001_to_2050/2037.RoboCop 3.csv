0,Leofwine_draca,An abominable way to close the trilogy,2,3 November 2016,"This lame sequel to the brilliant original masterpiece is yet another example of the law of diminishing returns. Also, unbelievably, it's aimed at CHLDREN, astonishing when you consider the level of mindless violence which filled the first two films. There's not a lot of originality this time around, and film is mainly a rehash of the first, with a plot about punk gangs and soldiers and rebels thrown in.Nancy Allen dies in the first half hour, probably because she didn't want to appear in this garbage. In the first film, when someone died, it meant something. Now we just don't care anymore. To add insult to injury, the lead actor has been changed, as Peter Weller was wise to decline his invitation to return. Robert Burke simply doesn't have the power of Weller, a much under-rated actor in my opinion. Burke's as wooden as a plank. The rest of the cast simply go through their clichéd, uninspired motions.The main disappoint for me was the lack of violence in this film. Let's face it, it was the violence that made the first film what it was. Now, a few people get shot and that's about it. Instead, there are lots of 'comic' scenes which fall flat and show that the material was wearing thin. Robocop was never designed to be a protector of children or a kindly saviour. He was a mean, vengeful cyborg cop who shot the baddies repeatedly and threw people through glass windows and stuff. To see him flying around in the sky in a jet pack is just a travesty, it really is. Degrading stuff.The special effects aren't that bad, apart from the aforementioned hugely unrealistic jet pack scenes, but there's nothing remarkable on offer here, little stop motion animation. The only good thing the film has to offer in the way of effects are the cyborg samurai, Japanese guys who are robots underneath. When their faces smash and stuff it's pretty interesting. Otherwise, it's time for this Robo-outing to visit the scrap heap. Or the realms of television, which is where in fact he went after this abomination.",RoboCop 3
1,SnoopyStyle,Good story but still need better production design,5,14 February 2014,"Omni Consumer Products has been taken over by a Japanese corporation. They are now trying to clear out the city of Detroit with a private army of Urban Rehabilitation officers to make way for the construction of Delta City. Now the inhabitants have taken arms against both the law and the criminals. RoboCop (Robert John Burke) is reprogrammed to take out the inhabitants but he has a change of heart with the help of Officer Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen). Then they send in the samurai robot Otomo.The Urban Rehabilitation officers look stupid. They need to look scary. And the criminal gangs look like bad campy 70s stereotypes. There is a general problem with the production design. All of it looks cheesy. And I don't know what a samurai robot is suppose to look like, but this is as bland of a samurai robot as there is. I do like the story more than RoboCop 2. It's a lot clearer and less messy. However the B-movie production design continues. The franchise needs a darker cooler reboot.",RoboCop 3
2,Prismark10,A bad robot production,2,15 May 2018,"Peter Weller bailed out from RoboCop 3 and in this film, Nancy Allen soon follows.What is worse you have to wait for ages for Robert John Burke to show up as RoboCop. He sides with the down and outs of Detroit City who are being moved on by the Urban Rehabilitation Officers hired by the evil corporation, Omni who want to clear the slums and build new skyscrapers.Angry at RoboCop's actions, the villain McDaggett (John Castle) hires robot ninjas to take him out and Omni smear RoboCop as having gone rogue.The original Robocop directed by Paul Verhoeven was an ultraviolent satirical classic with black humour and an anti corporate stance.This is a poor film lacking any subtext of the original but just cashing in on its success. The effects look cheap and the script is third rate.",RoboCop 3
3,jboothmillard,RoboCop 3,3,28 June 2005,"I liked the first two films, the first the most, but this third instalment is just a waist of time. Why did they have to change a really well cast Peter Weller as the cybernetic cop, to a rubbish Robert John Burke. I can't remember any of the story apart from RoboCop going into some kind of sewer or something to live for a while. That's about it. It's obviously Robert John Burke that makes this film the most stupid of the three. I can't remember seeing any good fight or gun scenes, and no good special effects like Paul Verhoeven's film. You remember the guy melting! Also starring Men in Black's Rip Torn somewhere. Adequate!",RoboCop 3
4,BA_Harrison,"They sold us out, those capitalist pigs.",4,14 December 2010,"It's ironic that corporate greed, a topic satirised throughout the RoboCop series, was ultimately responsible for the death of the franchise. Seeing a potential fortune to be made from lucrative movie tie-ins (video games, toys, cartoons, fast food promotions, comics, t-shirts, bubble bath etc.), unscrupulous studio execs at Orion targeted the third chapter in the RoboCop series at a wider (ie., younger) audience, diluting its impact and selling out fans of the original film in the process.Directed by Fred Dekker (of kiddie horror hit The Monster Squad fame), working from a script by comic writer Frank Miller (whose earlier script for RoboCop 2 hardly did the franchise any favours), the last in the trilogy abandons the grit, gore and satirical content of the first film: rather than the cynical vision of down-town Detroit as an urban hellhole inhabited by lawless scum, we now discover that Robo's stomping ground is actually loved by the honest folk who live there, so much so that they are willing to take up arms and fight OCP, the evil corporation that wishes to relocate them in brand spanking new accommodation (the rotters!). With one of RoboCop's prime directives being to protect the innocent, it's not long before the chrome-headed cop joins the fight for freedom, and the poor people of Detroit get to stay in their slums. Hooray for RoboCop!Since every good action figure should have plenty of evil adversaries and cool accessories (kerching!), the dumb script also introduces a Nazi-style head villain, robot ninjas, a gang of punks, plus a cool snap-on flame/thrower and jet pack for Murphy; these supremely daft elements, combined with the cartoonish action, cloying over-sentimentality, awful dialogue, and stereotypical good guys (one of whom is a lovable child from the ghetto able to hack into high-tech computers—gack!) all go to make RoboCop 3 an unmitigated disaster.3.5 out 10, rounded up to 4 for the bit where the ninja's jaw gets dislocated—that bit was actually pretty freaky!",RoboCop 3
5,BandSAboutMovies,RoboACAB,6,18 April 2021,"RoboCop 3 presents an astounding and completely science fiction conceit: a robot police officer built by a corporation decides to stop serving the interests of law, order and the establishment and throws in with a bunch of homeless multicultural people. Read this line and get it: RoboCop gets shot by a bunch of white supremacist cops, realizes ACAB and gets woke. Then he gets a jetpack and fights robot ninjas.Obviously, this movie is amazing.Director Fred Dekker has an interesting career, writing House and House 2, as well as writing and directing The Monster Squad and Night of the Creeps. The original script was written by comic book writer and artist Frank Miller*, who also did the previous film in this series. He was so upset by the way his screenplay was treated - comparing it to dogs urinating on a fire hydrant - that he left Hollywood until Sin City.The biggest change is that Peter Weller decided to make Naked Lunch** and the lead role was played by Robert John Burke, who was the Dust Devil in the movie of the same name, as well as the lead in Thinner. Dan O'Herlihy also didn't return to lead Omni Consumer Products. And spoiler warning, but Nancy Allen's Officer Lewis gets killed minutes into the film.OCP is calling in the bill on Detroit, using Paul McDaggett and his team of Urban Rehabilitators to forcibly move out the residents of Cadillac City, killing anyone who disagrees. The Kanemitsu Corporation also works to move this plan forward, replacing the police with their violent Otomo robots.When RoboCop and Officer Lewis try to stop the Rehabs from killing civilians, they are gunned down and our hero's fourth directive forces him to stop defending himself. He's rescued by the very people he wanted to save, including Nikko, a young robotics genius who has somehow turned ED-209 into a good guy.As RoboCop is rebuilt, he joins with the underground, led by Dr. Marie Lazarus (Jill Hennessy) and Bertha (CCH Pounder). Seriously, this movie is cast so well, with Rip Torn as the OCP CEO, Mako as the leader of Kanemitsu, Stephen Root and more.Look, I get it. RoboCop is the best of this series and this one really cuts down on the violence. Dekker admits that the hero's journey of Officer Murphy/RoboCop was complete by the end of the first movie, but you know, I kind of like the idea that a human in a robot shell who has only been a cop can see the errors of his mindset. He's no longer acting like Judge Dredd shooting everything in his path. Instead, he has to connect with people beyond his fellow officers.It also looks pretty good, thanks to director of photography Gary B. Kibbe, who Dekker chose after seeing his work on They Live, which this movie is very similar to, and Prince of Darkness. Dekker called John Carpenter to ask for his blessing to use Kibbe and after telling him the premise, Carpenter joked, ""Homeless people taking up arms. That's real left wing.""This is way better than it should be and when seen in 2021, it's an even better film. If Dekker could have gotten to do the things he wanted to do - adding in more Hong Kong style martial arts, an extended jetpack sequence and an ending where Officer Lewis becomes a cyborg, it would have been something people other than me remember.*Otomo is similar to Miller's comic Ronin and CCH Pounder's Bertha Washington is a reference to his character Martha Washington.**To his credit, Weller met with Dekker and explained why he wasn't doing the movie in person, which is a pretty stand up way to act.",RoboCop 3
6,Coventry,Destroy Robocop III. Or there will be. Trouble!,3,5 September 2018,"There are two principal reasons to dislike, might even say despise, ""Robocop 3""! First, what's the matter with the rating? No installment in this glorious franchise should be allowed to have a PG-13 rating! PG-13 ratings are for Disney movies and ""Police Academy"" sequels! I grew up loving the downright brilliant Paul Verhoeven original and the underrated Irvin Keschner sequel just because they are so excessively and gratuitously violent as well as sadistically humorous! In their desperate attempt to reach wider audiences and softer ratings, the producers neutralized Robocop a lot more than ED-209 or RoboCain ever could! And yes, I do mean the producers, because I refuse to believe that director Fred Dekker or writer Frank Miller voluntarily wanted to cut back on violence. It's so ironic, in fact, since corporate greed and treason is an important main theme in all ""Robocop"" films! Perhaps OCP is just short for Orion Corporate Pictures instead of Omni Consumer Products? The saddest thing about all this is that ""Robocop 3"" most definitely has the potential to be a full-worthy and 200% violent sequel. The script is filled with interestingly absurd ideas, like battles with Japanese samurai-cyborgs, ""The Warriors""-style punker street-gangs,police retaliations and aerial equipment for Alex 'Robocop' Murphy. None of these masterful gimmicks are elaborated and illustrated the way they should (= with a lot more bloodletting and cynical sneers) and the attempts to maintain the insanely over-the-top TV commercials or news broadcasts are pitiable. I also don't like that Peter Weller doesn't return as Murphy/Robocop, and his substitute Robert John Burke has the charisma of a textile cloth, but he isn't the reason by this film fails. A few years after the events of ""Robocop 2"", corporate holding OCP has been taken over by Japanese tycoons, but the plans of the management remain in place: build the new and hi-tech Delta City on the remnants of Detroit. The residents of the pauperized suburbs continue to resist, however, and thus OCP put together a special squad to aggressively evict people from their homes and kill whoever obstructs the process. Since this squad, led by the megalomaniac McDaggett, is so beastly, more and more traditional Detroit police officers, including Robocop, begin to turn against OCP and join forces with the rebels. There, I nevertheless insisted on summarizing the plot, just to demonstrate that Frank Miller's story holds the potential of being a fantastic ""Robocop"" film installment! Oh yeah, I wrote at the beginning that there are TWO reasons! This might be merely personal and not based on any reliable sources, but I'm pretty sure that ""Robocop 3"" killed the career of Fred Dekker. Things looked quite promising for Dekker in the late 80s, when he made the child-friendly horror gem ""The Monster Squad"" and the absolutely fantastic ""Night of the Creeps"", but after the failure of ""Robocop 3"", he never directed another film. Thanks a lot, OCP!",RoboCop 3
7,bevo-13678,Best one yet,10,16 May 2020,I didn't see it but I'll take a punt and say it's as good or better than the first two. Or maybe worse,RoboCop 3
8,Theo Robertson,""" Mind Your Languge . There's Children Present """,4,6 January 2011,"Paul Verhoeven,s ROBOCOP is quite rightly considered an 80s genre classic that successfully coupled violent visuals with a human story and biting satire . Audiences weren't bowled over by Irvin Kershner's 1990 sequel but is nowhere as bad as is often made out . Likewise ROBOCOP 3 has a very poor reputation but didn't deserve to spend several years in the IMDb bottom 100 Movies list. It's by far the least of the trilogy but its reputation lies not in the fact that it's a terrible film from a production point of view but more that the way the studio seem hell bent on making the franchise family friendly The bottom line is if you enjoyed the comic book graphic violence of Verhoeven's classic then you'll find this version totally lacking what made the original so enjoyable . Everything here seems to be produced to cause as much inoffence as possible . In fact if the producers had cut out several infrequent uses of the "" S "" word then you could actually class this as a family film . When people saw the original ROBOCOP did they envisage that a short time later they'd be watching a family friendly film franchise ? From the opening shot of a sweet innocent child who looks like she waltzed in from a Disney film down to the way it's only bad guys who get killed in a laughably bloodless way you realise you're watching something that jars with the other previous two movies . It's almost like watching an inversion of a STAR WARS sequel where Hans Solo snorts cocaine from Princess Leila's naked breasts before engaging in unnatural sex acts with her The story itself is very simplistic and plot wise it's no different from what you've seen in countless , forgettable B Western where cattle barons drive out the homesteaders from the territory . Substitute cattle barons for OCP and homesteaders for Detroit citizens , set it in the Mid West in the 19th century and you'd hardly have to change a word of dialogue . Even the climax of Murphy having to take on an android ninja seems culled from these corny movies of men in stetsons doing what a man has got to do . The fact that the protagonists are metal men doesn't make it less obvious I don't want to sound like I'm saying this is a great film - it's not - but neither is it one of the worst films ever made . It certainly deserves the tag of "" Worst film featuring ROBOCOP in the title "" . It probably wouldn't have such a poor reputation if it wasn't part of a franchise , one of which is considered a classic genre piece . I've certainly seen worse films featured on the SyFy channel this week",RoboCop 3
9,poolandrews,The Robocop series took a huge nosedive with this rubbish...,3,23 January 2008,"Robocop 3 is again set in Detroit in the near future where OCP are in partnership with a large Japanese corporation to build Delta City, unfortunately OCP & this Japenses lot want to build it on a rundown ghetto called Cadillac Heights but the residents of Cadillac Heights have other ideas & refuse to move. OCP decides to play dirty & hire a team of mercenaries lead by Paul McDaggert (John Castle), the future of law enforcement the cyborg Robocop (Robert Burke) becomes caught up in the conflict when he protects an innocent group of people against McDaggerts men. Robocop decides to join the Cadillac Heights resistance & protect the innocent residents & their homes against OCP & the demolition crews...Co-written & directed by Fred Dekker one has to say that the original Robocop (1987) is one of the greatest sci-fi action films ever, Robocop 2 (1990) is right behind it as another great film which brings us on to Robocop 3 which in my humble opinion is simply terrible. The script by Dekker & graphic novel artist Frank Miller (Sin City, 300, Daredevil) is absolutely awful, everything which made the original Robocop so brilliant is gone, everything that made Robocop 2 such an entertaining sci-fi romp is gone & we are left with some kids film without any intelligence or trace of a meaningful plot. The biting satire, the cold hearted cynicism of big business, a really evil bad guy, the convincing portrayal of a future time & all the conviction from the original two Robocop films is sadly lacking. What we end up with in Robocop 3 is that the makers have tried to turn Robocop into some comic book character with the embarrassing climax where he gets rocket powered jets so he can fly, they give him some awful one-liners & have him team up with some annoying 'cute' kid to save the day & avenge the death of his partner. Which neatly brings me onto the clichés, the often used scenario of a cops partner being killed who then seeks revenge is here, the freedom fighters who live in sewers, the big business bosses who don't care about the 'liitle people' & a horribly sentimental ending in which Robocop saves everyone, he gets his revenge & the residents of Cadillack Heights get to stay in their homes. Did I mention it was very predictable as well, I didn't? Well, I guess I just did.Director Dekker ruins what was a great series of films & Robocop 3 undoubtedly killed the franchise off. I have no idea why but the violence is toned down to such a level Robocop 3 is pretty much PG stuff all the way, there are a few minor swear words but nothing to offend & not a single drop of blood. This just isn't a Robocop film as far as I'm concerned. The special effects are terrible too, the sequence at the end when Robocop flies is truly embarrassing to watch these days it really is. There are several continuities between this & the previous Robocop films, the company OCP, Johnson the executive, the 'I'd Buy that for a Dollar' advert, the SUX car, ED209 gets a small cameo & Sgt Reed is back as well. But while there are elements from the other Robocop films the tone is all wrong & it just comes across like a kids comic book superhero film. There are a couple of OK action scenes including a silly car chase when Robocop commandeers a pimps pink car & a few alright explosions. Certainly nothing to get that excited about.With a supposed budget of about $22,000,000 Robocop 3 opened with a disastrous weekend box-office take of less than four & a half million dollars, I guess the plan to get more people to watch it by toning down the violence & language didn't work. I wonder if Robocop 3 would have done better if it has been 'R' rated & featured lots of violence? I doubt it could have done any worse. Filmed in Atlanta, Georgia. The acting is awful from all concerned.Robocop 3 is an awful film, a film which I like to blank out & consider it not as part of the Robocop franchise which for me stopped after Robocop 2. Followed by the TV series Robocop (1994 - 1995) which ran for twenty three episodes & then the Canadian TV mini series Robocop: Prime Derectives (2000) which has a running time of almost 400 minutes.",RoboCop 3
10,utgard14,RoboCop Becomes GizmoDuck,4,27 June 2014,"RoboCop fights to help homeless people, or something like that, in this lackluster third entry in the series. The first movie was amazing. The second was a huge step down but not unenjoyable. This one is mostly crap. Peter Weller is gone. The production is low budget. RoboCop doesn't even show up until 20 minutes into the movie! They soup up RoboCop in silly ways that reminded me of GizmoDuck from the DuckTales cartoon series. He gets to fly and everything. Oh and it's watered down to the point that it has a PG-13 rating. I suppose it's still watchable if you are a big fan of the series or maybe B movies in general. But most people will likely find themselves struggling to finish it. Try to stick with it long enough to see RoboCop fly, though. It's not impressive but it's one of those craptacular cinematic moments you will want to tell your grandkids about.",RoboCop 3
11,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"The slow, agonizing death of the series",1,26 November 2008,"More British people will be villains... less subtlety will be in symbolism... and no clichés will be left untouched. Our hero faces the greatest threat this time around: A family film. Since when was RoboCop anything resembling child-safe? The humor almost invariably(the ""rocket scientist"" bit is arguably a notch above the rest) takes such a dive, it goes right through the bottom in a mess of few jokes and gags, and an even smaller amount that anyone could actually find remotely funny. The dark comedy in this comes off as extremely misplaced. They continue the tradition, started by the prior entry, of making fun of what we earlier took seriously. Honestly, there should be severe penalties for the ""puppy"" line. The attempts at recreating or mimicking elements of the first get increasingly desperate, and the ""satire"" is worse than nonexistent, it's plain *ugly*. Some of what Frank Miller wrote for the sequel before this one that wasn't used in that, made its way into this, utterly devoid of the fun and imagination of how he thought it up, of course(do read that comic book instead of viewing either of these, if you're a fan of his). Evidently, between the previous picture and this, Johnson turned into... well, his name. In fact, all the old characters seem messed up, several are parodies of their old selves, and the new ones aren't that interesting. Credibility is an issue, too. It can be debated how adequate a choice Burke was... he certainly doesn't bring a lot of emotion to the part... but CCH Pounder, Rip Torn and Mako do impressive work. How do you manage to render their efforts forgettable? I suppose this script was what it took. And Stephen Root... for crying out loud, they wasted *Milton*! The ""flight gear"" and Otomo... let's just say, I'm with Rod Hilton in regards to those. A cute, spunky kid hacker(and of course, computers can do whatever is convenient for them to do) is one of the leads. Who thought this would be worthwhile? Who in their right, or even wrong or twisted mind, would take a look at the description of those ingredients, and sincerely feel that it would come to be anything other than Pure Crap Stew? The pacing is lackluster. The acting is underdone or overplayed. This has not got a single memorable scene to it, and you'd be hard pressed to find any redeeming qualities. The action is dull and uninspired(I would like to point out that more than one of the sequences consist of one fighter *nudging* their enemy every so often). Whatever thematic material or message there is in this is a poorly stated, micro-wave re-heated puddle of whatever was left of one of the points the original movie made expertly, that the second also tried for. In the end, this one isn't even good for a laugh, or to see how low they sank. There is quite frankly nothing here. I recommend this to no one but those who have an abundance of time and an unquenchable thirst for watching train wrecks. Everyone else... you're probably better off pretending this doesn't exist. 1/10",RoboCop 3
12,view_and_review,Why???,1,3 January 2005,"Its been a while since I've seen this movie... I think it was 1993 that I saw it. But I do remember this.... it SUCKED! The first Robocop was good, kinda gory, but still good. Robocop 2 was an improvement even, I thoroughly liked it and even watch it to this day. It was going to be hard to follow up Robocop 2 and the epic battle between Robocop and Cain. But they tried to follow it up anyway, or can we really say that they tried?? Because when you watch this drivel it would only lead to the conclusion that they let their kids write, produce, & direct. It was a gimmick, a parody, a joke.Firstly, they should never have strayed from the ""R"" rating because some of that is what made parts one and two. Then they make it all gimmicky with the samurai droids, him able to fly and other useless garbage. THEN they went to a different actor for the role of Robocop!! The special effects were sub-par and the story was even worse. This was a total flop!!",RoboCop 3
13,gridoon2021,Domesticated Robocop,5,22 May 2020,"The weakest of the Robocop trilogy, but still a watchable movie. There are moments where it gets the mixture of spectacular, slam-bang action and campy, deadpan comedy which characterizes this series just right (the OCP employee suicide). And the special effects are still first-rate. It's just that the concept of a socially-conscious Robocop is SO corny, and with the toning-down of the violence to an almost laughable degree plus the inclusion of a precocious good little girl (as opposed to ""Robocop 2""'s precocious bad little boy) it is clear that this entry is designed to be as family-friendly as possible (the PG-13 rating can attest to that). The change of actors in the title role has little effect (Robert Burke's jaw is adequately square); John Castle plays the oily villain and does a pretty good Laurence Olivier impression. ** out of 4.",RoboCop 3
14,Uriah43,Seemed Rather Contrived and Artificial,4,29 October 2017,"Having allowed greed to get the better part of them over a long period of time, the corporation known as OCP now faces bankruptcy and this greatly complicates their pet project aimed at renovating the entire city of Detroit--for a huge profit. So to help them with their diabolical scheme they merge with a Japanese corporation who shares their desire to build a new city named Delta City over the ruins of Detroit. Needless to say, to do that they have to remove the residents currently residing there. With that in mind they hire a firm known as the Urban Rehabilitators led by a ruthless man named ""Paul McDaggett"" (John Castle) who then issues instructions to physically evict all residents within the proposed Delta City radius. However, their heavy-handed methods soon draws concern from ""Robocop"" (in this film played by Robert Berke) who joins the rebel faction fighting for their rights. Angered by this the Japanese corporation sends a robotic ninja named ""Otomo"" (Bruce Locke) to handle the problem. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this film lacked the depth of both of its predecessors and seemed both contrived and artificial as well. That said, while I don't consider it to be a terrible movie by any means, it wasn't exactly that good either and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Slightly below average.",RoboCop 3
15,AaronCapenBanner,"Better Than The Second, But Still Weak.",4,28 August 2013,"Vast improvement over the dreadful Part II, this still suffers from feeling watered-down, and overly kid-friendly, as Robocop returns to fight his own company again, who are ruthlessly trying to evict the citizens of Detroit to make a profit, and are trying to merge with a Japanese conglomerate, while at the same time stave off bankruptcy.Though there are some good action scenes, and its heart is in the right place, this feels tired, as if there was no sense of urgency or purpose behind it other than completing the story. A shame, because with a bit more story preparation, this could have been good, but feels rushed, though it sat on the shelf for two years! Does have a satisfying ending though.",RoboCop 3
16,Mr-Fusion,Welp. This is what a kid-friendly RoboCop movie looks like.,5,21 January 2016,"At this point, there's been enough vitriol leveled at ""RoboCop 3"", that to throw some more on the pile seems kinda mean-spirited. Make no mistake, it's not great, and a far cry from the original. Pretty much everything you'd expect from a RoboCop movie aimed at the family market. Murphy sprays bullets like the A-Team, and he's pretty hapless (mostly just stands around, waiting to let the bad guys take the first hit). And the killing-off of a major character didn't account for much of anything (what a waste).And ugh, the pimpmobile.But I'd be lying if I said it was torture. The OCP exec's plummeting to the pavement actually made me laugh (c'mon, it was funny). It's bad, but not egregious. At least until Murphy dons the rocket pack and takes to the sky. That's when the headache sets in.5/10",RoboCop 3
17,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Oh, my God (insert uncontrollable laughter here)",3,27 January 2007,"I just had to see this sequel, like I explained in my other Robocop 2 comment, my friend lent me the Robocop Trilogy and so my excuse is... well, I had no choice? Lol, OK, I know, I had a choice, but I was curious and wanted to see what the third Robocop was like because I have heard horrible reviews and you know when you hear so many bad things about something that you simply have to see for yourself? Well, I guess this was the case, I think we could all relate. But yeah, this movie was very over the top and very silly along with the dramatic time change.I'm guessing it must be the future due to the ""futuristic"" equipment, even though everything is very dated. So now another part of OCP is on the case of destroying Detroit by making people homeless and jobless, but don't worry! Robocop is on the case! He looses his faithful partner to the evil corporation and tries to save the homeless while trying to stay together for the evil robocops that Japan has sent over. Can Robocop defeat OCP once again? And by the way, you'd think after all the evil talk from the first and second Robocop movies, OCP would have gone out of business by now.Robocop 3 is very over the top again, like the line stated in the movie ""Just follow the explosions"" to see where Robocop was. But I think there must be someone out there who is absolutely in love with this movie or the trilogy itself, as for me? I think I am just going to stick with Terminator, please I recommend that you do the same, otherwise you might go crazy with all the strange coincidences that is the Robocop series.3/10",RoboCop 3
18,MovieAddict2016,Undoubtedly the worst of the series,2,21 November 2003,"RoboCop (1987) was a hard action picture with brains, heart, social satire, and wit - mostly thanks to Paul Verhoeven, the eccentric filmmaker responsible for Total Recall and Basic Instinct.RoboCop 2 (1990) lost the heart but still had the violent edge. It seemed somewhat geared towards children, the plot was tired and recycled, the violence still packed a punch but lacked the seriousness and dramatic flair of the first film. In a sense, all humanity shining through the RoboCop character from the first film was gone.RoboCop 3 (1993) has none of the above. It has no heart, it has no brains, it has no sly social puns, and it has no hard violence. It's goofy and stupid. Over-the-top and obnoxious. Some qualities are redeemable. Most are not. It's undoubtedly the worst of the series.Filmed in 1991 and delayed for two years due to film company Orion's pending bankruptcy, RoboCop 3 centers around Murphy, a.k.a. RoboCop (Robert John Burke), joining forces with evicted squatters who are opposing Omni Consumer Products, the new conglomerate company running Detroit, which is kindly referred to by the homeless citizens as Opposing Capitalist Pigs. (Oh, how clever!) OCP is no longer run by The Old Man (Daniel O'Herlihy), but rather The CEO (Rip Torn), a character played over-the-top for laughs that never come; he is an annoying miscalculation and, in fact, almost a characterized representation of the flaws of the entire movie. He is in cahoots with the Japanese to throw citizens of futuristic Detroit out of their homes and onto the street so that he can level their homes and build big money-making skyscrapers.RoboCop doesn't like this one bit, and after seeing a lone child named Nikko (Remy Ryan) run across a street and into the arms of squatters, he decides it's time to protect the innocent and delete his fourth directive, which instructs him to not oppose a member of OCP. After Lewis (Nancy Allen) is killed my a corrupt OCP employee, he swears to take vengeance and uphold the law.What a digression the RoboCop series made! It started as a biting social satire and a hard action film with heart; watching RoboCop 3 is like trying to focus on a Saturday morning cartoon serial with an invincible hero defeating uncountable foes amidst a very, very unfocused backdrop. It's hard to do. Co-characters extended in this film were made clearer in the first installment when they were given less time on screen. Johnson (Felton Perry), the black man who gave Robo the thumbs up at the end of the first film, is now partly a bad guy. He was supposed to be a fairly good guy in the first two. What's happened to him in between the first and third film that would cause him to cross over to the dark side? His evolution is as understandable as O'Herlihy's change from being a good guy in RoboCop to the villain in RoboCop 2.Peter Weller, who said making the first two films in this trilogy was the worst experience of his acting career (the suit was heavy and hot, shedding some number of pounds off his body on a daily basis), has left the series for more attractive projects, leaving John Robert Burke to fill in his shoes. Burke is okay in the suit, but his voice sounds too robotic when he speaks, lacking the monotone calmness that Weller possessed without any type of digital alteration. Burke just sounds like a robot, leaving all sense of humanity at the door. And with the mask off, his facial features look splattered with too much makeup and plastic, probably an ill-fated effort to cover up Weller's disappearance. It's not a biggie, as RoboCop himself is barely in this film at all.Yes, that's right, RoboCop is not really the subject of this movie at all. Perhaps because Weller left they decided to keep RoboCop off frame for as long as possible. He is introduced some fifteen minutes into the film during a heated (and ridiculous) car chase, he gets injured and disappears throughout most the film, comes back for a bit, then saves the day. It's like when they tried to cover up Crispin Glover's absence in Back to the Future Part II--only Zemeckis knew how to do it right. Fred Zekker, the director of RoboCop 3, does not.Paul Verhoeven was a great director at one point in time. He got away with over-the-top action because he had a way of making it brutal, gleeful and downright excellent, while managing to insert levels of humanity (remember Quaid's background in Total Recall? The flashback sequences in RoboCop?). Zekker's over-the-top style is different. It's obvious that he knows how to blow stuff up in between long passages of cheesy dialogue, but not much else.",RoboCop 3

20,KineticSeoul,"Disgrace to the ""Robocop"" franchise",3,18 May 2011,"This 3rd installment is most definitely the weakest movie in the ""Robocop"" trilogy. In fact it's inferior in every way compared to the previous 2 movie, despite the fact that the 2nd installment wasn't all that great but much better than this. At least in the 2nd installment Peter Weller still played Robocop, but in this it's portrayed by a different actor. I dislike it when the original cast get replaced in sequels and such. Watching this was like watching a cheap episode of a ""Robocop"" TV show than a actual movie. The plot is just terrible, I don't know if it's because it tries to be kid friendly but it just doesn't work. The special effects look really cheap in this and seems like the most low budget out of the 3 movies in this franchise. In fact this one is just not worthy to be in this franchise, this movie really does ruin this franchise from being a good trilogy. In fact it does a lot of damage to this franchise, for being the 3rd installment everything is super lame and stupid. There just doesn't seem like any effort has been made for this one, maybe the creators just thought it's ""Robocop"" so there doesn't need to be much effort made as long as they make their money. Which is sort of ironic because of the plot in this movie. I am giving this movie a 3.5 because I seen worse.3.5/10",RoboCop 3
21,Robert_duder,A TV Movie quality follow up that borders on ridiculous...just didn't go right,6,17 June 2008,"Now I won't say that Robocop 3 is the mega disaster that a lot of reviewers call it. I mean Robocop 3 lost the benefit of being an eighties action film so granted the violence and foul language would be toned down because suddenly the political correctness of the 90's was in full swing. So that meant making Robocop more family friendly. They also lost Peter Weller from the lead which I didn't realize how great he was as Robocop until he wasn't him anymore. I have to wonder if screenplay writer Frank Miller was angry at the creators of Robocop so he spun this tale as a cruel prank because Miller is no slouch at writing, he is a legendary comic writer (300, Sin City, X-Men, etc.) and the story for Robocop 3 borders on ridiculous. All of the dark gritty atmosphere is pretty much gone from the original film, the tongue in cheek political humor is gone as well despite some off attempts to do exactly that. And it is true what reviewers have said that Robocop has suddenly become a complete weakling. He spends so much of the film repeatedly falling on his robo butt and trying to get back up. He's lost all of his cool factor, all of his heavy hitting super hero instincts.Robert John Burke takes over the robo suit as Robocop and Alex Murphy. He just doesn't seem to have a handle on the character and doesn't give as much effort as Peter Weller did. Maybe it's because the first two films were so much better but Burke just isn't cut out for Robocop and spends most of his time trying to get back up on his feet. Rip Torn takes the helm away from ""The Old Man"" as head of OCP. Torn is a decent actor but he doesn't seem to have near the screen presence that Dan O'Herlihy had in the original films. They do mention The Old Man several times so to close his portion of the story. John Castle is one of the villains in the story as McDaggett, yet another corrupt OCP Officer working to rid the city of Robocop. He's okay, a little strung out and insane but decent enough. He doesn't hold a candle to previous villains in the series. Nancy Allen returns thankfully as Robocop's partner Lewis and the film does give her character something of closure so I give them kudos for that. Robert DoQui also returns for his third go around as Sergeant Reed and for the first time in the three films he really gets into the action which is terrific. Jill Hennessy joins the cast as Dr. Marie Lazarus who personally takes care of Robocop. Her performance is a little bland as she often is in her roles. It's a big cast with some decently memorable faces but I can't cover them all here.So here is why Robocop 3 is NOT the disastrously horrendous film that some make it out to be. First of all it ends the trilogy with a final big battle between OCP and the Detroit Police Department which essentially brings OCP down. It also brings back some of the familiar faces from the series and gives closure to the story on Lewis although her and Burke just don't have the chemistry that her and Weller had as partners. The story is decent enough and simple enough to follow but it just doesn't hold up to the previous two films. The entire aspect of Robocop flying is so ridiculous and they surely had to know that it was ridiculous. If it ain't broke don't fix it and they do fix the unbroken recipe which essentially ruins the series. It is true that Robocop 3 was a fall from grace and this film felt like the quality of a TV Movie which is maybe why all future Robocop installments hit Television. A rather bland disappointment. 6/10",RoboCop 3
22,ericstevenson,Film isn't THAT bad,5,11 May 2018,"For Sequel Month, we're unfortunately looking at what is regarded as one of the worst sequels ever made. I confess to not watching ""Robocop 2"", but I really have no interest in that, given how the original's a classic. The basic plot is that Robocop joins a resistance against an organization of corrupt cops trying to take over Detroit. The premise is too basic and pretty flimsy. The effects look pretty off sometimes too. It expands little on the mythos of the franchise and mostly just reprises stuff from the original.As bad as this can get, I didn't think it was terrible. It doesn't really ruin anything about the character or the setting. I didn't find the characters to be too stupid or anything. It's just nothing special at all. It didn't make me mad or make me feel insulted or anything. It's just another one of the many pointless sequels out there trying to cash in on the success of the original. **",RoboCop 3

24,CuriosityKilledShawn,The death of great potential,1,5 April 2001,"I've got a great idea? Let's take one of the best movie franchises there is, make a crap sequel starring a new actor in the lead role, take away all the ultra-violence, dramatic irony and tone it down to make it appeal to kids. Oh and chuck in some pathetic SFX for good measure.This movie should not have been made. Plain and simple. Robocop 2 was unfairly panned on its first release but this junk deserves every bad comment it gets. The direction is terrible, the budget appears to have been about $5.63 and the story has NO redeeming qualities. It's not even entertaining accidentally. I'm not kidding, it is so bad you can't even laugh AT it.The attempts at turning Robocop (more like Hobocop) into some kind of comic book superhero fail horribly. Just what the hell was the deal with the jetpack? It also looked embarrassingly fake. John Castle made a very poor villain. He was hammy instead of scary and campy instead of evil. Man, even ED-209 was tame. This is a film that you should ignore, no doubt. Robocop: Prime Directives went on to become even worse. Poor Murphy.",RoboCop 3
25,callanvass,A P.G rating and Robocop is a terrible combination,4,22 March 2014,"OCP employs a bunch of sadistic mercenaries to take the people of Detroit out of their homes, out on the street. When Nikko is evicted and forced away from her parents, she joins up with a bunch of rebels led by Bertha (CCH Pounder) to make a stand about losing their homes. Meanwhile, Murphy (Robocop) loses his best friend Anne Lewis. He promises her he'll get revenge on the people who killed her just before she died. Robocop is a classic movie that was ahead of its time. The second sequel was a major disappointment, but this movie is even worse. This isn't the train-wreck people say it is, but it's pretty mediocre. When Peter Weller refuses to return as Robocop, Nancy Allen only agreeing to return if her character is killed off, you know things are in dire straits. A P.G Robocop isn't very effective, you just don't do it. I realize the remake of Robocop is P.G, I don't agree with that either. Robocop should be loaded with violence and bloodshed, just the way it is. The violence is so toned down because of the PG rating that it hampers the movie in a huge way. Nancy Allen was a fixture in this series, this is how you repay her? Not only that, but Robocop's revenge was so anti-climatic. I wanted to see something gritty vengeance, not the stuff we got. Flying Robcop with a jetpack? It's like the writers wanted to purposely crap all over the legacy of Robocop. The set-up is actually filled with potential, but it fails to maximize on it. It should have been much more intense than it was. It's filled with droll humor that seems so out-of- place. Wait until you see the scene where a bank robber walks into a diner with a machine gun, only for a bunch of cops with guns to be there. The acting is OK. Robert John Burke resembles Peter Weller in looks, but not in talent. He has some lame one-liners and I didn't get the emotional feeling like I did with Weller. It's not entirely his fault, he has nothing to work with. Nancy Allen is a trooper for agreeing to a small role. CCH Pounder gives the best performance in the film. Remy Ryan is tolerable as the kid. Thankfully, she didn't overdo it. Jill Hennessy is gorgeous to look at, average performance wise. They didn't explore her character enough. People like Mako, Rip Torn & Bradley Whitford are wasted in their roles. This isn't the atrocity people say it is, but it's a lifeless sequel that killed the franchise. The PG rating really makes this a mundane experience, along with some stupid writing. Robocop enthusiasts may wanna see it out of sheer curiosity, others beware4/10",RoboCop 3
26,ironhorse_iv,"I know a lot of people hate this movie, but honestly I would buy Robocop 3 for a dollar even with its flaws!",4,16 January 2020,"All I need is 20 seconds to comply. This American cyberpunk action superhero film written by Frank Miller of comic book fame & directed by Fred Dekker is a guilty pleasure of mine! Set in the dystopian future of Detroit, Michigan, the plot centers around RoboCop (Robert John Burke) trying to save the city from falling into the hands of a corrupt armed force created by his creator company OCP called the Urban Rehabilitators under the command of Paul McDaggett (John Castle). Without this 1993 film too much, this third movie in the 'RoboCop' franchise was a tepid attempt to make future installments in the series more family oriented by aiming for a PG-13 rating. While, I know a lot of people hate that Orion Pictures did that. They need to understand why they did it. The majority of the fan base were primarily children who readt the comics. So it make sense to market it to them as Orion was having financial problems. Plus there was a TV Show in the works so they needed all the eyes that they can get. Although the move seem likely to succeed. Sadly the movie bomb at the box office as it face tough competition from other children target movies like 'The Nightmare before Christmas' that debut one week earlier. To make it worst, Miller upon finding out that his script was yet again heavily altered from what he originally wrote; abandoned the film & swore off Hollywood for a very long time until 2005 'Sin City' was in production. Despite that the motion picture still maintain many of the comic book writer's dark ideas such as corporation funded militarizing of the cops forcibly relocate residents into camps without the ridiculously trashy, bleak and mean spirited nature. However the gritty foul language of the piece was cut down to cheesy insults that doesn't sound like it should be coming out of the mouths of criminals. Regardless of that, I was glad that some of Miller's edgy satire Meta humor toward the media & commercialism is still there and uphold the same style from the first two films without the overused of gratuitous T&A. Women are lot more respected here even if female characters like police officer Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen) isn't given much of anything to do besides being the key that drives Murphy to seek revenge. At least they made diversity female characters like Bertha (CCH Pounder) into a somewhat of a badass and made Dr. Marie Lazarus (Jill Hennessy) into somewhat of a heroine. As for Remy Ryan as Nikko Halloran. She does seem like annoying John Conner Terminator 2 unrealistic hacker rip off and perhaps the most extreme example of a studio trying to get children to see the movie. Nothing against the actress, but I found her character to be shallow and stereotypical. The villains were a mixed bag as well. Rip Torn replacing the old man played by Dan O'Herlihy in the last two movies didn't really add anything nor was his absence explained. Plus the whole stereotypical Japanese company meager felt too cartoony for my taste. To add onto that, I really hate the snail paced duel with the Japanese robot Otomo (Bruce Locke). It was awkwardly done. That action scene could had been done better like 'Ghost in the Shell' style. If anything John Castle was perhaps the best one of them all. I love that lowrider car chase with his character. As for Robo Cop, it's kinda sad that Peter Weller didn't return to play the titular protagonist. Robert John Burke played him pretty robotic bland despite the character gaining most of his past personality from the last two movies. Did I miss something here? Did he get his memories erased yet again before this film started because direction 4 is also back? It's never explained much like how the residents can't hear the giant wrecking ball about to hit their houses in the opening. Despite that the majority of the action scene with him were alright. This include the street battles between the police and the Rehabs. It was somewhat cool to watch even the jetpack flying climax was a bit disappointing because how fake looking the green screen flying was. I love the ridiculous funny moments as well like RoboCop's car breaking through and jumping from concrete parking lot. Follow up with him shooting the roof of his car to get out and got roasted by Molotov cocktails. It's so over the top. I was laughing my head off, much in the same way he plow through the broken elevator door later on or get a pimp car totaled. It's has that it's so bad, it's good vibe. Despite me liking the movie, I do have to agree with Miller that the film was a fire hydrant and a row of dogs did urine on it. Regardless we can all agree that the music is always great to listen to. I'm so glad to see original composer Basil Poledouris returned to do this film. He brought back many of the recurring music that were missing from the second flick. Overall: While 'RoboCop 3' is indeed the most terrible movies from the franchise even worse than the 2014 remake. It's far from being totally forgettable. There is plenty of things in the film worth watching. In short while I can't recommended viewing for all viewers.

In how many kid (disney) movies, you see America becoming Amerikka ? Here, the poor Americans are arrested and deported by fellow Americans who look like SS and for business interests; if they resist, they are labeled terrorists... In how many kid (or also parents) movies, do you hear that firms can become abusive, that they are money obsessed, ready to exploit the feeble one ! In how many kid (or also parents) movies, do you see that globalization is bad and that work can destroy life ? In how many kid (or also parents) movies, you see cops refusing to take unjust orders, medias objecting to give subjective news ? So Robocop leaves his boss, his firm, his directives to join rebels, to fight against the order but for social justice ? Finally, for sure, this isn't the usual, expected political correctness that we are constantly brainwashed so this time I thank Miller for a really acid and mean story !

Does the third film in the RoboCop franchise have what it takes to stand side by side with its predecessors?Well no, not really. They main problem here, once again, is the story. The original film was a brutal, gore-filled satire. It was aimed for adults and for what it was, it took itself surprisingly seriously. It questioned the meaning of humanity, the morality of stripping away free will for efficiency's sake, what it meant to uphold law and order to the best of your abilities. Whereas this movie simply thinks it's cool that there's this robot dude that has all these gadgets, shoots really good and beats up bad guys. It's merely a cheap superhero storyline given a paint of RoboCop. A thin paint, because even the character doesn't feel authentic, siding with rebels and actively going against the law and order.And this is a shame, because on the technical side of things, it still feels like a genuine thing. It has the feel of a RoboCop film, for the most part. Sure the main actor has changed, but I really couldn't tell most of the time. Sure the monotone helps hide the differences, but still, good job Robert John Burke. Furthermore, the set designs, the music, the feel of the action and so on, it all works. But it's hard to remain invested when you're expecting an adult science fiction story and the movie is trying to treat you like a fifteen-year-old.This is a heavily flawed film. It cannot be recommended to any hardcore RoboCop fan, because it betrays its source material so badly. Yet as a standalone film it does deliver some good action scenes and interesting visuals. It'll keep you entertained, if you just let it. So, not for everyone, but personally I don't begrudge seeing it.",RoboCop 3

The movie was so unwanted that Peter Weller didn't want to reprise his role of Officer Murphy for a third time.

Robocop 3 follows on from Robocop 2 left off, with OCP being brought out by a Japanese company and must start construction of Delta City or else go bankrupt. They need to force the eviction of a poor district and OCP are met with armed resistance and when Robocop's (Robert John Burke) partner, Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen) is killed by OCP's lead thug he ends up joining rebels.Robocop 3 is a very poor film, suffering from a number of problems. There were major casting changes and whilst Burke does a decent job replacing Paul Weller, but he is surrounded by an atrocious acting, such as Remy Ryan as a genius child hacker. The action was very weak, especially compared to the first two, the violence was toned down and had horrible special effects when the first two have very strong effects for their time. It looked cheap: in the first film Robocop had ED-209 as a threat, Robocop 2 had RoboCain, Robocop 3's big threat was a robot ninja and only played by a regular man.Lewis was killed off in this film, a major character in the series and she wasn't even given a proper send off, just killed so the film could showcase their bland British badguy is evil, enjoying pain, suffering and power.Robocop 2 was a film with major problems, but at least director Irvin Kershner and his writers were trying to honour and recreate Paul Verhoeven's look and style and try and keep the satirical elements of the first film. Robocop 3's director Fred Dekker disregarded the legacy, making a less serious yet less funny film. It took 20 minutes before we got to see Robocop (I think by the third film people don't need to wait to see him). They was no effort on the satirical edge or being interesting.Bradley Whitford from The West Wing was a refreshing presence in the film, being a bright spot as the Jackass extraordinaire and Julie Hennessy as Dr. Lazarus was one of the better performers.As a finale to the Robocop trilogy Robocop is a wasted opportunity, dumbing down and toning a very adult series and serves as the Batman and Robin of the Robocop series.",RoboCop 3

Everything is now the property of OCP including the private residence of an individual, and if you resist eviction, police will come in with a wrecking ball, and full military assault weapons. Humans are reduced to property as well, and anyone who fall out of the system, and resist the tyranny of OCP and the police is labeled ""Terrorists"".This is extremely close to the current situation of our country in that over half a million foreign troops are in United States because the US military has refused to shoot at American citizens. One executive order from the president can declare martial law, suspend constitution and privatize communication, transportation including cars, and property. It's amazing that this movie accurately predicted the future of the country 20 to 30 years before its time, and excites me to watch the take the producers had at the time the movie was made. The movie is well made, and contains irony as well as humor in the mix.For these reasons, this Robocop movie is the best of the three that's made for me.",RoboCop 3

That said, if you were to take RC3 out of that context and simply judge it as a standalone film... it's still pretty bad. But not awful.

However, some of the citizens form a rebel alliance and fight back against OCP and the mercenaries.Ahhh here we have Robocop 3 which is kindly referred to as the turkey of the franchise. Although this third film is far from perfect I do think that it's unfairly maligned and I will attempt to explain why I'm prepared to defend it...First of all if we begin with the story; here we basically have the entire focus of OCP and their greed which is pretty much what the first film explored. I think that's what gives it the edge over the second film as I found the story stupid in the second film whereas it was better in this film. Think about it you're more likely to get on side with a bunch of rebel fighters who are trying to protect their homes as opposed to a bunch of violent drug-pushers. Given the fact that Peter Weller was responsible for making Robocop something of an icon it was a brave move for Burke to accept the role in this third film. To his credit, Burke does a very good job and was every bit as good as Weller in my opinion. Granted it was a risk re-casting the role, but I personally felt that it paid off here. Another strong aspect of this film is that the writers made it more of a human story and explored Robocop's emotional psyche more; examples of this are Robocop's decision to disobey an order to go and rescue Lewis OR Robocop's decision not to tell Niko that her parents were dead. Robocop 3 is notably less violent than the first two films which may disappoint those with a lust for blood. I myself have no problem with blood and violence, but I think it was toned down here to create a more human story. I also suspect that the writers perhaps didn't want to create too much of a copycat sequel. This film also has so much camp value that's almost impossible not to like this film; Robocop is given a lot of dry dialogue here and some of the lines that he delivers are cheesy, but very funny as well (this camp humour was present in the first two films, but there seemed to be more of it here). The final line in this film was probable one of the most memorable that I've come across and was also very funny. Are there any problems here? Well as Churchill the dog would say 'Oh Yes'...... The first half of the film is dull and lifeless and was a bit of a slog to get through. Thankfully though the second half is much stronger so this isn't a major criticism. I thought the inclusion of a flight pack for Robocop was a ridiculous idea. I also thought the inclusion of the Splatter Punks was a bit pointless and unnecessary. Some of the performances were woeful(particularly from Rip Torn who I felt was miscast here as he lacked the menace that the original old man had in the first 2 films). I also found it hard to take him serious as he reminded me of Terry Thomas with that stupid moustache. Aside from Burke, the only other performance that I rated in this film was that of Paul McDaggett who did give the film some of the menace that we saw in Robocop and Robocop 2. The robot ninja character could have been developed better and the fight scenes between him and Robocop were ridiculous, anti-climatic and the resolution was rather predictable. Overall then this is a mixed bag of a film, but for me the human story and the camp value combined together made this to be a fairly enjoyable film or possibly even a guilty pleasure. Yeah it has its problems, but I don't believe that it is deserved of its terrible reputation. I actually thought it was a slight improvement on Robocop 2, but it doesn't come close to the greatness of the original Robocop.",RoboCop 3
38,rooprect,Bizarre... like watching a cutesy 80s TV show with blood & guts,5,20 September 2012,"Although this final installment of Robocop doesn't measure up to the original 1987 masterpiece, or even the 1990 sequel, I've got a special place for it in my heart. That would be the ""wtf did I just watch"" chamber.If you remember the old 80s TV action shows... like ""The A-Team"", ""Spenser: For Hire"", ""MacGyver"", etc... you're halfway there. These were shows that didn't have a lot of substance but were fun to watch anyway. The plots were mostly predictable and the execution was corny, but that's precisely why we watch them.Robocop 3 is an unusual return to that style (whether by design or not). Plot is linear, scenes are bright, dialogue is snippy but not particularly witty, and dramatic/disturbing scenes are glossed over, almost as if it's made for a PG-13 audience (WHOA, I just realized this IS PG-13... while the first 2 films were rated R).Yet the film also injects spots of extreme violence and creepy dark humor... like the 2 or 3 ""comedic"" scenes of people committing suicide, which did make me laugh out loud, I admit. Those were the scenes I liked best because they remained true to the original dark satire of the original Robocop.I still don't view the Robocop trilogy as an action story but rather a brilliant dark comedy. Robocop 3 has the same bizarre news briefs and hilarious commercials peppered throughout, and although it's not as thick as in the original, the vibe is still there. But the overall feeling is one of campy 80s. Check out the hilarious 80s hairstyles & clothes (denim jackets... dear lord I thought we burned all of them!). Really bizarre. If the director intended it to be deliberately ironic, he's a freakin genius.",RoboCop 3
39,guisreis,Against the conventional wisdom: it's the best film of the trilogy,8,21 May 2014,"It is really bizarre that so many people consider this sequel an awful movie. It is by far the best film of the franchise. It has all the qualities of the two previous movies, without their flaws. Indeed, I consider the first ""Robocop"" overrated, the worst of the three, as it lacks the interesting sociological and political elements brought by its two sequels.It is very impressive that a film about a super-policeman have the courage of showing that when the State goes against the citizens, they have the right to defend themselves. The important critique of the privatization of public services, present in the previous movies, remains strong too.Besides that, ""Robocop 3"" doesn't have problems of the first two films of the trilogy, like bad casting (really awful actors for the smaller roles and extras) or ridiculous scenes.",RoboCop 3
40,davidmvining,"You know, for the kids!",3,8 November 2021,"The third entry in the RoboCop franchise is a great example of what was going wrong with a lot of franchises in the 90s. Toned down to appeal more to kids while only retaining the barest amount of talent from the original films no matter how unimportant to the actual story, Fred Dekker's RoboCop 3 is the Saturday morning cartoon version of a hard R-rated satirical action movie. Where the second movie went wrong by trying to be too much and satisfying nothing altogether, the third firmly sets its sights on the most dumbed down version of the same idea.Poor Nancy Allen. Her character of Anne Lewis was never a huge part of the first movie. She was a supporting character with no real life of her own, and the second movie had little idea of what to do with her. The third kills her off in a Death Wish attempt to give our titular hero some motivation, literally any motivation, that the audience can latch onto. In reality, he has a couple of different reasons why he decides to back the homeless people of Old Detroit against OCP's new relocation forces headed by Paul McDaggett (John Castle), but it all feels like weak justification to keep RoboCop involved, especially since he disappears from the film for large swaths of time.OCP has been purchased by a Japanese conglomerate. Why? So we can get a Japanese robotic samurai, Otomo (Bruce Locke), to fight RoboCop in the finale. Does it make any sense? Not really. Does it affect anything? Nope. Is it at least cool to watch? Not at all.Anyway, I'm getting ahead of myself. The efforts to build Delta City are about to go into overdrive, and OCP needs the residents out. They're pushing everyone out with the relocation forces, and the brilliant eight year old hacker (oh, dear lord in heaven...) Nikko (Remy Ryan) gets separated from her parents and ends up with Bertha Washington (CCH Pounder) and her terrorist crew that are trying to do...something about OCP's efforts. It's really unclear what their end goal is, though they do mention holding out for three days when OCP won't be able to do anything anymore because...I don't know. They, along with Nikko, break into a police armory complete with Nikko, ugh, hacking an ED-209 and making it, ugh, loyal as a puppy (I don't think this part was in Frank Miller's original script). With these weapons (and not the ED-209 which would be great to have, you know?) they flee.Then, Officer Lewis gets called to give chase, crashing and being attacked by splatterpunks, Mad Max inspired gang members in Old Detroit (why are people trying to save this place?). Who are the splatterpunks? Doesn't matter. Do they matter? No. Are they eventually good for one of the movie's few good jokes? Surprisingly, yes! We have that to look forward to, a throwaway moment an hour later that made me giggle. Does this scene matter? Well, it gets the OCP executive Jeffrey Fleck (Bradley Whitford) to yell at Dr. Marie Lazarus (Jill Hennessy) about killing RoboCop's emotions because he gave up chase of the homeless van to save his partner (the emotional connection between RoboCop and Murphy was never that strong). She, of course, doesn't follow through, and...it doesn't matter all that much. Are we sensing a pattern yet?Now, the movie's hard edges have been sanded far down, but there is one sequence that does have a hint of the original's satirical joy. After RoboCop decides to protect the homeless and Officer Lewis gets shot dead, news runs rampant that OCP's mechanical police officer has gone rogue, and OCP's offices have descended into chaos. One executive, with his wife on the phone, walks out onto the ledge of his office dozens of floors up, and jumps out. The timing of the editing between his jump and his fall to the left side of frame as another car pulls up in front of the building is hilarious. And, moments later, Fleck gets fired after having showed off his gun, saying that he'd go out with a bullet to the head if it ever came to that. He walks out of the office, and again, the timing is perfect as we keep with the scene he leaves behind, eventually hearing the single gunshot.That's almost the extent of the joys of the film, though. RoboCop ends up sidelined for pretty much the rest of the movie until halfway through the action finale as nothing of any real importance happens around him. Otomo eventually tracks him down, but Otomo and RoboCop don't have any kind of connection, so it's just empty spectacle. It'd be one thing if the fight between the two was well filmed, but it's pedestrian at best. The police all quit the force in protest of OCP's plan to wipe out Old Detroit, and they set up barricades to fight. The removal teams decide to bring in the splatterpunks as extra guns (why? It doesn't matter), and we get the one moment where a punk with huge green spikes for hair, in the background of a tracking shot, tries to fit on a tactical helmet without messing up his hair. What can I say? After 90 minutes of almost universal drudgery, I laughed.Is this movie remotely good? Not in the least? Is it a fun time anyway? No. Does it have brief moments of levity? Yes. Are those worth the investment of time? Not at all. The film is mostly kind of boring, though it's perfectly competently made. The script is a disaster. Whatever ideas Frank Miller had wanted to put into this were gone by the time this came to theaters. It's just bad.",RoboCop 3
41,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,It still has its problems but they are much more forgivable,8,8 June 2012,"After watching the first RoboCop, I was really looking forward to the sequel. And once I saw the sequel, I could not believe how derivatively messy it had become. When it came to this film, I wasn't sure what to expect. Peter Weller had moved on and Robert Burke had taken over as the ironclad police officer. According to the majority of viewers, RoboCop 3 was garbage. Turns out though, I liked it. Maybe not as much as the first for various reasons but at least this movie carried forward with the story of Alex Murphy. Unlike the first sequel that drove us in circles.RoboCop is back one more time to save the city of old Detroit. But this time, it is on a much bigger scale. It is not mentioned to how the ""old man"" of OCP disappeared, but it's assumed that he finally died. Now in charge of OCP is the CEO, played by actor Rip Torn, and it's up to him to make sure a place called Cadillac Heights is ready for deconstruction within a certain date. So to remove the people from this area requires a group of officers called ""The Rehabs"". But as the audience will discover early in the intro, that these officials aren't very helpful nor do they care.The head of the rehabs is Paul McDaggett, played by John Castle. John Castle is good as a selfless official but that's all he is. He's not a Boddicker and not a Cain. Burke as RoboCop isn't a bad fit either. Yes, it would have been better to still have Weller in the suit but hey, you do with what you have. And yes, Burke makes Robo sound funny but it's really not that annoying. As long as the voice isn't high or super low pitched, it shouldn't be that big a deal. Even when Robo's helmet is off, the make-up department did a swell job having him look like he did in the last 2 films.Co-starring Burke are some of the last remaining characters from the cast of the first film. Felton Perry is still playing Johnson, only this time, he seems like he's having a hard time picking sides. He's been apart of OCP for a long time but soon realizes how corrupt the company has become along with its massive dept. Of course I don't understand how he didn't see that with half his fellow co-workers biting bullets and attempting to fly out windows. Nancy Allen is still around as Anne Lewis, Murphy's first and only partner. Even sergeant Reed (Robert DoQui from the last 2 films) is still there. He too realizes the corruption of OCP and decides to take a stand. It's nice to see OCP finally lose its foundation.One thing in particular I did not find enjoyable is the lack of bloodshed during this film. The director of this sequel is Fred Dekker and it surprised me that he allowed this film to be rated PG-13. Why Dekker? You made Night of the Creeps (1986) and that was rated R? I mean at least you still could have had the screenplay release some four- letter words to get it an R rating. And it's not productive to make a sequel and have its rating changed from all the others that came before it. I understand that the reason is to have a broader audience of ages but how does it help when the kids don't even know who RoboCop is or what his background was? It's a plan of failure and Dekker should have seen that.Not to mention that RoboCop has a machine gun that he can now attach to his body. God that would have been cool to see if this film was rated R! Plus, he can fly now too. Yeah big deal to some of you skeptics but it really is a nice addition. Basil Poledouris is back as well, to do the his noted music again for this franchise. So that's a plus. And the best part is by the end of this film, Alex Murphy at least finds a group of people who don't treat him like an investment but more like a human. Isn't that what we wanted from the past two films? I did.Having the last installment being rated PG-13 was a wrong move but it can be seen that Dekker's team tried hard to bring back the other elements that made the first film a hit. And for most, it should please its fans for at least making that attempt.",RoboCop 3
42,eric262003,They Should Have Pulled The Plug After The Sequel,3,6 August 2013,"The OCP has now a powerful grip-lock on the city of Detroit. Along with their Japanese shareholders, even the Detroit Police Force is now under their jurisdiction as they are now working for them. With the Japanese shareholders they are in the process of destroying the already crumbling Detroit and transforming it into a more enhanced ""Delta City"". However liberal sewer dwellers who not going sit down and let this happen; they will revolt to any means necessary even if it means through violence and carnage.However, the OCP hires some ""Rehab Teams"" which are military police led by a menacing cyborg named McDaggett whose plan is to bring those who oppose the OCP and make them part of their justice. But the opposing liberals find a robot that will side with them. After the death of Officer Lewis (Nancy Allen), Robocop (Robert Burke) has become the defender of the rebels in their quest to win back their city and to take down the OCP of its own foundations.I'm sorry to say that this was the most unpleasant way to end the series. In fact they should have pulled the plug after the second instalment. Granted, the story had a lot of good things going for it, the script was the definitive Achilles Heel that really made the movie appalling, which also made the performances mediocre at best.The tone of violence was watered down badly as it went from an R rating in the first two instalments to a dismal PG-13 rating. Even the swearing was toned down gregariously as well. My guess was that the producers were trying to promote this film to a more broader audience. They went far as to have an animated version of ""Robocop"" as a way of making merchandise and if that's not enough to hurt a franchise, remember a few years ago Robocop invaded WCW wrestling and came to the aid of Sting (Steve Borden), that was pure ludicrous (Who remembers ""Capitol Combat 90: The Return of Robocop"") This is the worst thing since Rick Steiner having a verbal spat with Chucky from ""Child's Play"".Another factor that hurt the series was its frugal budget. The first movie you could not go wrong with the special effects. And the violence was gritty and effective as the bullets were aimed to perfection.The acting overall was a letdown too as the only character with spark (pun intended) was Robert Burke who filled in for Peter Weller as the heroic Police bot. With the new characters, the development was absent in this instalment. If you are curious and would like to see it I'm not stopping you. It's still enjoyable, but not very memorable.",RoboCop 3
43,Sandcooler,"The original on crack, a must-see",6,23 March 2012,"Fred ""Night Of The Creeps"" Dekker directing a ""RoboCop""-movie, on paper it's really not that bad of an idea. If you can direct 90 minutes of snails shooting out of people's heads, you can probably direct a decent action flick as well. And you know what: in practice it sorta holds up too. Everyone who loves ""RoboCop"" is supposed to hate this movie with a fiery passion, but Dekker's complete insanity is just so irresistible. I don't think the guy ever even wrote actual scripts, literally everything about his movies seems to be thrown in at the last minute. Screw it, we'll work in some ninja androids, why the hell not. It's not an ideal way of filmmaking, but it's undeniably entertaining. The only thing that really bothers me about this movie is our group of heroes, which is just completely unlikeable. Rooting for the villains is not an uncommon thing in this genre, but these protagonists are just disturbingly bland. The contrast with the awesome villains just couldn't be bigger, which is sort of a bad thing because villains rarely win in this genre. ""RoboCop 3"" probably ruins the complex mythology of RoboCop or whatever but come on, chill out. It's a lot of fun.",RoboCop 3
44,mjw2305,About what you would expect for a second sequel,3,29 January 2005,"Firstly if you don't like Robocop at all, then obviously leave this alone, if you've never seen Robocop, watch the first film, then come back and read the rest of this.Robocop started out as a hard ass cyborg, you simply wouldn't mess with (He even helped spawn a video game, in which he fought the Terminator, you've got to be Tough to be mentioned in the same breath as a Terminator - you get the point, he was hard) and, he was portrayed by Peter Weller, who did a good job.In number 2, Peter Weller was still there and Robocop was still fun and still tough, even if it wasn't a great movie.However, now on to the third film, take my advice and miss it, even for Robocop fans, there little here to enjoy, and this is why.Robert Burke, has replaced Peter Weller as Robocop, and i not knocking him as an actor (I Don't know much of his work), but he isn't Robocop, Period. Also Robocop is now as weak as a kitten, and Oh yes, and he can fly now too, Yawn! This movie simply insults the Robocop name, in every way, i can't think of a single reason to watch this film, it's another case of no sequels necessary (although Robocop 2 - wasn't all bad)3/10",RoboCop 3
45,oneguyrambling,An ignominious end to an obsolete technology.,4,27 December 2011,"Same old, same old but with two wrinkles.One; this film is decidedly PG, no real violence, blood, or profanity, and the black comedy in the fake ads is toned down accordingly too.The second is the introduction of what should have been a cool nemesis for the slow and ineffectual automated upholder of the law: a Robo-ninja. But they f*cked that up too – more on that later.Detroit must've gotten tired of being the scungy future city, in this film most of the action takes place in the fictional Delta City. This time OCP, the company that runs the police force has been taken over by a Japanese company, meaning everything is more efficient and profitable – even the Robo-Ninja.I won't spend much time on this one because this is where a mediocre franchise really hit the downslope and got desperate. Roby 3 has a genius tech savvy 6 year old working alongside the resistance and performing elaborate hacking and programmes with her rudimentary laptop that is bigger than her. It also introduces Lewis with such drama and seriousness that you would think it was a De Niro reveal. Nope, just the same untalented actress still hanging around dining off the same one shift association with an automated cop.A typically seedy and punkish looking gang serves as the resident minions, and it is 20 minutes before we even see Roby this time out. Peter Weller has gone, but that was never a big factor anyway, consider this just another set of lips spouting the same banal dialogue and cheesy catchphrases.Everyone is still surprised again when he thinks for himself, again he is gunned down and left for dead, and again once he realises just who is behind everything he comes up against a purpose built Robo-Cop-Killer, the altogether too built up Robo-Ninja.Look I hoped like hell that the battle of the Robos would rock, which made the awkward pacing and two or three moves before a crappy killing stroke battle that followed so disappointing, I can't stress enough how dodgy the two confrontations between the Robo's are.In fact the 'massive' finale is full of tacky sub-Troma-esque touches. In a street battle with hundreds of enemies face to face on both sides and thousands of rounds fired no-one dies until Robo-Cop shows up, and after he wins the day in 15 seconds flat everyone jumps around like drunk idiots after the superbowl.Final Rating – 4.5 / 10. The first two films weren't much to write home about, but RoboCop 3 is lamentable, consigning the future's most unnecessary and ineffectual robotic hero to the scrapheap.

46,mentalcritic,Insulting... just plain insulting...,1,27 February 2001,"""RoboCop 3 is aimed at children"" say some. These people want to tell you to ease up on RoboCop 3, obviously compensating for the fact that they are simply too insipid to get the tone of the unequaled original. I was but a nine year old boy when I saw the first RoboCop, which has taught me valuable lessons about the difference between what people say and what they mean, along with the consequences of violence. Granted, I enjoy RoboCop even more as a young adult because I understand more what Neumeier and Verhoeven were saying about Christian America, but the point is not that RoboCop was aimed specifically at adults, but rather that it was aimed at people with a brain in their head.By comparison, RoboCop 3 has obviously been aimed at special education classes. Is there some kind of requirement for ""commercially viable"" screenwriters that they confuse the word ""underage"" with ""retarded""? There must be, given the commercial success of garbage like Barney et al! I would not have been surprised to have seen a scene from this mess in which RoboCop tells a behind-the-camera ally that they are not good if they don't have good feelings.I won't even go into how the ultra-violent, ultra-sarcastic feel of the original has died in favour of a He-Man like marketing style. Some people claim that the problem with RoboCop 3 is that the story is underwritten. That is a significant part of the problem, but compared to others, it is minor. The real problem with this film is that the dialogue and special effects are utterly dreadful. Anne Lewis' final words to Murphy were so pathetic that I honestly wanted to take a hatchet to the cassette I was viewing the film with. For such a wonderful and fulfilling character to go out like this was truly heartbreaking to watch, for all the wrong reasons.Peter Weller was the sensible actor, turning down the chance to reprise his most famous role a second time. He made the right choice, although his career has never so much as eyed the mild peak that the original RoboCop brought. Regular cast members such as Robert DoQui really made me wonder why they were in this piece of crap. Their characters have little to do, and their dialogue is so abysmal it makes one long for the subtleties of a Police Academy tour-de-force. After the way in which inflection turned three simple words into a bolt from the heavens during the original RoboCop, calling the dialogue here a disappointment is being overly polite.Then there was the main villain of the story. In the original, RoboCop battles a gang of hardened criminals, a poorly-designed battle droid, and his memories. In RoboCop 2, he battles with a drug lord who is used to create a new and improved cyborg. In RoboCop 3, he is battling a faceless bunch of wimps from the corporation that created him, and a Japanese cyborg called Otomo. The one ingredient that made RoboCop's enemies as compelling as they were was their personalities. Clarence Boddicker was an angry, hate-filled killer whose manner of behaviour and relating to others made one wonder if he was abused as a child. He was a match for RoboCop because one could feel an equal amount of fury coming from him whenever he was on-screen. In RoboCop 2, the main opponent for most of the film was a drug lord called Cain. This was a slight falter because Cain had all the personality of a squashed gnat, but the error was reversed when he was turned into RoboCop 2, a cyborg that took the Iron Man syndrome (listen to the Black Sabbath song of that name while watching parts of the original and you'll get what I mean by that) to new heights. Otomo had about ten minutes of screen time at most, and would have been ripped limb from limb by the RoboCop of the first film.RoboCop was one of the films that made my early life worth living, and I credit it with making me want to write scripts for films and television among other things. RoboCop 3 is basically one studio's effort to take everything that I hold near and dear, then basically insult and rape it for a few bucks. I utterly loathe and despise all who were involved with its production without being involved in either of the other two films. To those who did take part in the other two films, and then signed on for this pile of crap, all I have to say is ""why?""...",RoboCop 3
47,fmarkland32,Breakdown...,2,4 April 2007,"This time Robocop joins a rebellion to his creator's Delta City plan which throws poor people out on the streets and locks them up in horrid camps (not unlike the concentration camps, which the movie implies) so they can build a new city, also Robocop is out to avenge his partner. The problem with Robocop 3 is that it's so clichéd and wooden that the simplistic approach kills any potential such a story has. Also another thing is that Robocop is hardly in any of the action sequences and when he is, he comes off as tragically wimpy. I mean Robocop beat ED 209 and Robocop 2 two worthy challenges and his adversary this time are ninja androids and an army? Also the grenade he takes to the chest is extremely ridiculous because he had to have been blasted twice by the machine in the second one by rockets and so this Robocop is positively not the killing machine he was in the first two. Also the tone of the film has changed into a more kid friendly action flick and because the first two felt like graphic novels this disappoints anyone over the age of 9. Still no matter how one slices it, this movie is a surefire franchise killer and with Robocop turning into a cartoon show and a lame TV show, this is the movie that started Robocop's downward spiral.* out of 4-(Bad)",RoboCop 3
48,one9eighty,I am now authorized to... be loyal as a puppy,2,25 August 2020,"The third instalment of Robocop sees director Fred Dekker take the director's chair, working on a story that he wrote with Frank Miller. Paul Weller is gone so Robert Burke comes into to play the titular character. Nancy Allen kind of returns, as Robocop's partner, Officer Anne Lewis. Rip Torn joins the cast as 'The CEO', basically replacing Dan O'Herlihy's ""Old Man"" character. This film cost $22 million to make but was a massive box office flop, only taking $10 million, that despite some of the technological advancements used - such as the digital morphing techniques used. Basil Poledouris who did the music on the first Robocop film returns after not working on the second instalment of the franchise. At 104 minutes, this 1993 came in for really mixed reviews, predominantly negative - but there were some people who enjoyed it still.Detroit is on the verge of bankruptcy, OCP are on the verge of gaining control as Detroit is close to default on their debts. OCP speeds the decline up by creating the Urban Rehabilitators, nicknamed ""Rehabs"" - working under the command of Paul McDaggett. On the surface the ""Rehabs"" have been created to help fight the crime issue in the city, in reality they have another purpose, which is forcing residents of Cadillac Heights out of the area. During one of their regular manouvers they all but kill a Japanese-American family, leaving a sole orphaned computer whizzkid called Nikko. OCP's dream of creating Delta City has slipped further away from them over the last two films, they are hopeful that a partnership with Japanese Corporation 'Kanemitsu' will prove profitable as 'Kanemitsu' own a major stake in OCP. The Japanese Corporation has its own robotic enforcers, ninja androids it calls ""Otomo"". The ""Otomo"" work with McDaggett to remove the Cadillac Heights residents. One night while defending Cadillac Heights residents from the ""Rehabs"", Office Lewis is wounded and killed, Robocop is wounded. He is eventually repaired by Dr Lazarus who is brought to the resistance base, and he upgraded too. His hidden ""4th Directive"" is removed, and he is given a jetpack that resistance stole (which was actually intended for Robocop anyway). Further fighting occurs, even to the point where a wounded Robocop has to face off against an ""Otomo"". The Resistance is eventually able to uncover damning information about OCP, they are able to put this out to the populous as a video message which prompts OCP share value to plummet. This turns the tide and the police working with McDaggett no longer support the cause, he has to turn to criminal elements to support him. Robocop goes after him but has to fight some more ""Otomo"" units in order to get to him. Thankfully he has support from Nikko and Dr Lazarus.Orion pictures recognised that the Robocop fan base seemed to be kids, so they made dramatic changes from the first two outings and cut a lot of the violence out, a move which alienated fans of the first two movies. Similarly the dark humour which was apparent before, particularly under the first director Paul Verhoeven was practically none-existent this time around. Another absentee was the man who had embodied Robocop for two movies, Peter Weller. While Peter Weller was not in the film it's not because he was unhappy, he was double booked for David Cronenberg's ""Naked Lunch"" (1991). This film went straight into production after ""Robocop 2"" was complete in 1990, but it was shelved for a year so didn't get a release until 1993 (The reason for the delay was because, like the fiction dystopian version of Detroit, Orion pictures went bankrupt). In hindsight, his absence was a blessing in disguise as I doubt that one man alone could save the franchise from what it had become. Although Frank Miller was attached as a writer, this was a move he later came to dislike. Similarly to the second Robocop film, a lot of his ideas and concepts weren't used. These two films made him feel disdain towards Hollywood stating ""Don't be a writer. The director's got the power. The screenplay is a fire hydrant, and there's a row of dos around the block waiting for it"". He didn't return to Hollywood until 2005 with ""Sin City"".I am not a fan of this film, as sequels go this is one of the worst, which is a pity as the first two films were really good. Going from an R-rated movie to a PG13 the way that this did removed a lot of raw and dirtiness from the film, which was part of the construct of the first two films. Robocop was the shining exception in the river of filth that was Detroit, and he was going to clean it up. This film just feels like a poor man's attempt to milk a cash cow, resulting in a film which is barely fit for late night cable channels. The villain's remain the corporations but their henchmen are so weak in this one that it's laughable. Going from ED-209 units to Cain-Robocop worked, but then going to a samurai robot that was just a guy pretending - that was a poor move. The plot was poor in this film too, the last two films were rich and complex with layers making up the story - this was just dumb, it had holes in it, it didn't make much sense at times, and it was, well silly at times too. I often wondered if it was intentionally made less intelligent to pander to kids that like the imagery of Robocop, having seen it in comics, cartoons, and video games. This was a big mistake - you should never dumb things down for kids as quite often they tend to be the more intelligent part of the audience, willing to challenge and subvert concepts. I actually watched this as a 13 year old, I thought this was stupid. When I rewatched this in my early 40's I still think that. Doing for the kids is apparent with some of the things you see in the film; ""ninja are cool aren't they - kids love ninjas"" .... ""The rocket pack, that can be marketed with the toy, let's add that in the film"".... ""the flamethrower, why not, it was in the video games, we can make a toy, get it in the film too"".As I have mentioned, I am not a fan of this film. I think this was a wasted opportunity to really make what could have been a stand out film. When you compare this to other films of the era you realise how much of a turkey this, and to be fair I'll give you 2 movies from 1991-1993 because remember, this was started in '91 but shelved till '93, so it's only fair to give a range of films that it could have been up against... In '91 - ""Terminator 2: Judgement Day"", ""Silence of the Lambs"". In '92 - ""Batman Returns"", ""Basic Instinct"". In '93 - ""Jurassic Park"", ""The Fugitive"". So was ""Robocop 3"" close to being as good as any of those - I'm afraid, not in a million years!Maybe ED-209 was talking for the film when he said ""I am now authorized to... be loyal as a puppy"" :(",RoboCop 3
49,phubbs,Robocop 3,5,19 January 2014,"With the imminent release of the new Robocop film I thought a rewatch of the notorious trilogy bookend was in order. Directed by Fred 'The Monster Squad' Dekker and written by graphic novel icon Frank Miller how could it go wrong? Well in all fairness I don't think they did go that far wrong abeit a few obvious changes.First of all as we all know the overall violence had been watered down hugely. Of course there are some that will argue that blood n bullets don't equal a good film, and they'd be right, but in the case of this franchise I personally think you need it. Like various other classic adult franchises ('Alien', 'Predator', 'The Crow' etc...) they simply work better without restrictions on who will be watching them, free reign...because they are for adults. So straight off the bat all the dark satirical graphic novel type violence and blood has almost been taken out. I say almost because the film does have some good moments. You can tell its an old 90's film because it does still manage to squeeze in some violence and edgy bleakness. A small scene where an OCP suit leaps out of their tall skyscraper due to their stock crash. Next scene we see a 'blink and you'll miss it' shot of him hitting the ground, well you don't actually see that. Plus during some actions scenes where bad/good guys are gunned down you do get some good old fashioned bloody squib hits just like the first two films. Most don't have any squibs but they are in there so the film isn't all PG-13, pretty sure you get that these days.The actual plot isn't too bad in all honesty, its not too unfamiliar but it works for this franchise. OCP control the cops and now have this special unit specialising in clearing out this specific urban region in Detroit to make way for Delta City, yep the're STILL trying to make Delta City. Naturally OCP are trying to make out this is a positive thing for Detroit and they're actually helping people relocate, but of course in reality they are acting like Nazi's and stormtrooping everybody off in buses without a care for families, property, well being etc... The concept works but its a forced one, most of these OCP guys are dressed like Nazi SS officers with long trench coats in militaristic fashion. They round everyone up just like the Jews were in WWII, many end up getting shot but all that is covered up by news propaganda. Their leader played by Brit John Castle is a decent Euro villain who snarls perfectly. So you throw Robo into the mix and at first, like the cops, he's following OCP rules but eventually he sees how wrong it is, as do the cops, and they all change sides. Its all very predictable, there are a few predictable sequences where the drama is suppose to be heightened to rouse your emotions, like when the cops turn up to help the civvies or when Robo goes after the bad guy who kills Lewis, but the film never really manages to charge you up as it should. It tries hard to do so but just feels flat. There are some nice visual moments (Robo's intro sequence) but nothing as iconic as the first film, hell even 'Robocop 2' couldn't quite give us anything that visually iconic.I think the worst part of the film was the inclusion of the Japanese company working with OCP. This really didn't need to be in there and I don't think you would of missed it if it wasn't. The most heinous crime for the film had to be the Japanese samurai assassin cyborg which was like something out of a trashy low budget ripoff flick. The daft part being this cyborg looked infinitely more advanced and sophisticated than Robo, more like a Terminator, and could have easily kicked his ass all over. Well he could of if he didn't just do martial arts flying kicks on him. He does manage to slice Robo's forearm off but somehow Robo is able to just stick that gun enhancement back on, despite his arm being half sliced off by a katana.The killing of Officer Lewis definitely meant the end of the road for this franchise though. I was still quite impressed they got quite a few cast members back for classic characters, OCP suit Johnson, Casey Wong, Bixby Snyder and Sgt. Reed are all back, as is a nice well done cameo from ED 209 (unaltered too). I was also impressed with the makeup on Robo's face when his visor is off. They managed to get Burke looking exactly like Weller! no dilution anywhere, the effects are spot on and look great as does the rest of the suit. I also think Burke did a good job as Robo, he accentuates his walking and mouth movements a bit too much if you ask me but apart from that he was good. All sound effects on Robo's movement, his gun, ED 209 and visual graphics for Robo's vision are all perfectly recreated, good continuity.Yeah so jet pack Robo felt a bit too much like a merchandising ploy but...damn I'll admit it I quite liked the idea. Its not too incredible an idea and it did look quite cool. I think the limitations on budget and effects hampered what could of been something pretty neat. All in all this film isn't as bad as I recall to be honest, it carries on nicely from the previous films, story is OK, effects all look as good as previous films...had Weller been involved who knows. Bottom line for me is the lack of graphic violence, grimy seediness and dark satire, a must in a Robocop film.5.5/10",RoboCop 3

53,ivo-cobra8,RoboCrap 3 a horrible asshole STINKER sequel ever,1,9 April 2017,"*SPOILERS* RoboCop 3 is the worst unnecessary terribly sequel ever made in the 90's and it is the biggest dog pile of sh**t ever! It is rated PG-13 a family film so why? This movie has so much problems I can't even begin to count.The first RoboCop was a classic best action rated Hard-R film, the second one was amazing underrated science fiction action film that stays true to the original film. This movie is abomination. A young girl reprograms ED-209 so that he stays a loyal as a puppy! I don't want to see a droid been loyal as a puppy that is horrible wooden and awful lame stinker of a movie.You have two samurais and RoboCop get's his ass kicked by one of the samurais and he doesn't do anything. A little girl safes RoboCop from 2 samurai cyborgs so that they destroy each other with their swords. Awful.There is no Peter Weller in this movie I am glad that he pass this movie to do other projects. Nancy Allen returns she is hot in this movie but by the first hour she is killed off! Why? What happened why did Nancy Allen insist to be in this movie only to get her character killed off? So that she could get a paycheck? What is wrong with her.What happened? Why did Frank Miller and Fred Dekker made such a terrible script? The screenplay is terrible the dialogues in here are terrible not memorable and pretty dull. Was it because ORION had a finical problems and in a desperate attempt they try to make a family action PG-13 movie to get more audiences? sadly this movie failed! Peter Weller, Dan O'Herlihy and Belinda Bauer did not return, the movie it self doesn't have an adrenaline or rush excitement or anything. This movie sucks ass. Robert John Burke makes terrible type of RoboCop he is awful and another STINKER cop again.His suit is awful I hate that RoboCop has a Gun Arm and he replaces his awesome gun from the first two movies with a machine gun on his left arm wow stupid. Why RoboCop has a prototype flight-pack and he flies after he was ass kicked by a samurai. Gosh the effects for this movie were horrible and really poor.This movie is poor and really a shame it could have been a good movie but it turned in to a lack of pile of sh**t. I hate this movie I hate it, why couldn't have been a good movie why?Fred Dekker really make a terrible horrible direction and I don't really like it a lot. This time they used music from Basil Poledouris in which audience complained about the music in the second movie but even the music score does not help and make this movie unique like the first one was it doesn't. This Robocop in here is awful and this movie stinks Frank Miller you make a lousy sequel that no one wants.I do have this movie on Blu-ray disc and I am not going to broke it or throw it away like mostly people do I am going to keep it in my collection but I am not going to watch it anymore because I HATE this movie to death!I am giving this movie F 1/10 doesn't deserve to be called RoboCop 3 by the way the acting from everyone is wooden and terrible in here and RoboCrap is a wooden bitch in here. This and RoboCock (2014) are both stinkers and they both suck a dick. They both can kiss my ass!",RoboCop 3
54,Maziun,"So bad , you can't even laugh at it",1,10 October 2015,"""Robocop"" is a classic science fiction movie that didn't had too much luck with the sequels. ""Robocop 2"" was a flawed , but decent sequel that was almost universally hated by the audiences and the critics. Too bad , because it stayed true to the original. It didn't had the freshness , depth or heart of the first one , yet the violent action and dark satire was still there. The franchise still had potential and I believe that with some effort there was still a chance for interesting next installments. Unfortunately the Orion studio had financial problems . They decided to make ""Robocop 3"" as a family friendly action movie rated PG-13 in desperate attempt to gain as wide audience as it is possible. ""Robocop 3"" was filmed in 1991, but was not released until end of 1993 due to production company Orion going bankrupt. The result ? A movie that is one of the worst movies EVER and a final nail to the franchise coffin.Making a ""Robocop 3"" movie with PG-13 rating makes just as much sense as making a porn movie with no sex at all ( maybe with some brief nudity here and there). IT""S TOTALLY MISSING THE POINT of the original movie ! It has no heart, no brains, sly social commentary and no hard violence. ""Robocop 3"" became the very thing that first two movies were often laughing at – a politically correct hero in a gutless , soulless and brainless Hollywood movie.To be honest a PG-13 ""Robocop 3"" movie COULD work. The story has some potential and you can make a exciting and deep PG-13 action movie (""The Dark knight""). Unfortunately the whole movie seems to be aimed at kids and has a cartoon approach to it that just doesn't works. I'm amazed that this even is rated PG-13 , not PG.Peter Weller made a wise decision not returning to the role of Robo and choosing ""Naked lunch"" to do instead. I recommend to watch that movie instead of ""Robocop 3"" . It may not be for everyone , but at least it's entertaining. Orion tried to hire Michael Dudikoff (""American ninja"") , but ended with Robert Burke . I can't say anything else about him except that he was in this movie. And that for some reason the studio modified his voice so it sounds annoying. Dan O'Herlihy, the old man from the first two films, does not appear in this film. The rest of the regular cast is back , unfortunately they don't have too much to do.Robocop here is basically a zombie with no personality. He also disappears for a large part of the movie. The regular cast has very little screen time and awful dialogue to work with. The new characters are annoying , especially Nico – kid genius hacker. The main villain is not one bit interesting or menacing. The acting here is awful with people either underplaying or overplaying their parts.The story here takes some elements from what comic book writer Frank Miller prepared for ""Robocop 2"" . Mind that both ""Robocop 2"" and ""Robocop 3"" were heavily rewritten and have only few elements from Miller's original script. The story here could work. Unfortunately the screenplay is filled with cheap humor , predictability and stupidity. I found a site on internet which points out that ""Robocop 3"" has faults in every scene ! The direction by Fred Dekker is apathetic. The pacing is lackluster. The action scenes are pathetic. The special effects are embarrassing , especially when you consider that ""Jurassic Park"" was in theaters that same year.This movie deserves every bad comment it gets. There are no redeeming qualities to this junk. After this movie there were two lame TV shows and cartoon. The franchise was slaughtered. I give it 1/10.",RoboCop 3

56,DarthVoorhees,Hey kids!,3,9 March 2013,"'Robocop 3' is a real turkey that for the most part deserves it's putrid reputation as one of the worst sequels of all time. It's a movie that offends me really more for the thought process behind it and for the aftermath it had on the career of director Fred Dekker. The film suffers because it has a violent tonal difference from it's far superior predecessors and any fan of those films is bound to be offended here. 'Robocop 3' is made solely for children because Orion thought they could sell toys. It's a kind of offensively ironic thought really because 'Robocop' is a movie that blatantly is about commercialism stealing the soul. I think as it's own piece 'Robocop 3' is merely a forgettable action film but as a sequel it is a slap in the face to the mythology and the fans. 'Robocop 3' feels as though you can feel Orion breath down the neck of the film. It is a children's film and it's a children's film in the worst possible way. It plays as if it thinks kids are stupid. This is a quintessential flaw, children are intelligent especially with adventure films. Why are films like 'Star Wars' or 'Superman' so brilliant at capturing the imagination of children and adults alike? Because they take time to develop a mythology and characters that are engrossing and spark the imagination. 'Robocop 3' is a sequel to two very adult films that have a mythology that deals with very adult themes that are beyond children's capacities. Gone completely in 'Robocop 3' is the violent anti-capitalist satire but even more important is the themes of losing one's humanity. Alex Murphy does not want to be Robocop. Robocop is a perversion of the laws of life and death and the first film is an exploration of what it is to be human. Sure Robocop looks cool but the aesthetics hide a troubled soul seeking to reclaim it's self. 'Robocop 3' is all about celebrating the cool looking aesthetics because they sell toys and not caring about what lie underneath. There is some aspects of the Alex Murphy resurrection story trying to fight their way to the surface here but they are ruined by the fact that this film can't play with them because they might scare children and so instead we get rock'em sock 'em jetpacks. 'Robocop 3' probably shouldn't have been made. There really wasn't anything left to tell in the story. That being said I think Dekker and crew had the foundations upon which to build something had they not been told to make a children's films. I like the idea of an armed resistance finally fighting OCP because it is very much a natural endpoint to what Verhoven set up in the original. The problem is that in order to do this story right you have to go into some radical leftist territory that doesn't sell tickets or toys. Fred Dekker takes a great deal of criticism for the film's failure and I don't think that is particularly fair. If anything this film is above a bomb rating because Dekker can effectively stage really brilliant action sequences. I think 'Robocop 3' could have been a lot of fun had they given Dekker complete creative control. 'Night of the Creeps' is a very funny and visually fun gory horror film and a 'Robocop 3' made in those lines would have been an effective fun end to the trilogy. I like the action scenes provided that some of the stupid dialogue is taken away.The film is just a mess and a missed opportunity. I like to think that somehow this film could have been good and Fred Dekker would get the respect he deserves and that this great series would have had a proper ending. The problem is you can see a film company perverting something profound in order to make money. Orion was kind of like OCP in that regard...",RoboCop 3
57,tomimt,Don't bother to watch this one if you liked the original,2,18 September 2005,"The biggest flaw of RoboCop 3 is, that it was actually made. It lacks everything that made the first RoboCop and even the second one great action movies: Good action and likable hero. And actually it does lack good acting and even a good storyline. Or actually the story in it might be good, but it's just told so wrong in the film.Second mistake is, that RoboCop is played by a different actor, Robert John Burke, who just doesn't fit in the part. He's even shorter than original Robo Peter Weller. Or at least Weller was little thinner. Or less bulkier. Or better actor. Speaking of actors, Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen) is one of the few original actors who did actually return into this third installment of the series, and even she had the wisdom to die in this. Good for her.And then there is this feeling in the film, that someone had a bright idea of making a kid friendly RoboCop film without brutal action.And if that isn't enough there are these pretty poorly executed special effects, like the flying jet pack RoboCop.As for sequels go, this isn't probably as bad as Conan the Destroyer, but it's pretty close.",RoboCop 3
58,Darkside-Reviewer,Can ya fly Robo?,5,28 May 2019,"I first saw Robocop 3 as a kid and loved it because it had a Robocop flying in it and his best friend was a little kid what 9 year old could hate that.I recently watched it again as an adult and well it's not the awesome movie I remember it being I still think it doesn't deserve the 1 star reviews and ratings people give it while it's nowhere near as good as the first 2 movies it's a fun 90s action movie that is just fun to watch and laugh at how bad the effects are it really takes you back to the bad over the top movies of the 90s while you may not give it 10 star ratings you will laugh and have some good old nostalgic moments.
My personal experience watching Robocop 3.One thing I will give this movie credit for is its story which is about people being kicked out of there homes and neighbourhoods by OCP who are knocking down Old Detroit to build Delta City a New Detroit the regular people in these neighbourhoods form a rebel group made up of the homeless the jobless people who have had everything taken from them by a greedy corporation band together and help each other by helping families have a safe place to sleep and eat there are scenes in the movie where families are forced to make homes huddled together in an abandoned factory where they help take care of each other even having lessons for children these scenes stayed with me since I was a kid and I remember thinking to myself that's how people should treat each other with respect and kindness even when in the worst of situations.

60,Min111,Surprised with the criticism,6,20 July 2017,"I'm shocked with the amount of criticism this movie has received. Just because the violence was toned down, doesn't necessarily make this movie, RoboCop 3, a bad one. Okay, the plot may have been a bit silly, but it was still a good movie nonetheless. I certainly enjoyed it. I use to own RoboCop 3 on video, and use to watch it all the time. My favourite part started right at the beginning. Really enjoyed the first and final thirty minutes of this movie. It had everything you would've hoped for in a RoboCop movie. I don't know why, but I gotten the impression that the movie was targeted towards a more younger audience since the first two movies were clearly adult films, and if that was their original goal then they've succeeded. I actually think the third instalment was much better than the second instalment of this RoboCop franchise series. I was actually disappointed with the death of Lois in this movie, and that wasn't required. A lot of people liked her character. She and Murphy made a great team. What makes RoboCop 3 unique compared to the other RoboCop movies is the fact that what this movie contains can't be found in these other movies (RoboCop and RoboCop 2). In this movie, for example, RoboCop is able to fly. How cool is that? You need to see it to believe it. RoboCop 3 had just as much action as RoboCop and RoboCop 2.",RoboCop 3
61,LebowskiT1000,My least favorite of the three so far...but not that bad.,8,6 January 2003,"I'm not really going to defend this film.  I can see why a lot of people wouldn't like this film, but there are some cool things to be seen in this film.  ...And it was much better than I expected.  This could have been an excellent film if a few things had been changed.SPOILERS AHEAD!!!The first thing that didn't sit very well with me was that they killed off Officer Lewis.  Granted, it was a noble death and was pretty well done, but I didn't want to see Lewis get gunned down so haphazardly.Secondly, there needed to be some better (and longer) fights between RoboCop and Otomo (The Japanese Android)!  All of the fights between the two were way too short and were anti-climatic.  Although, I must say I liked Otomo during the fight scenes, he had some good moves.  It just seemed to me that RoboCop was a bit of a wimp against Otomo.  And, in the finale of the film, our hero doesn't even get the ""kill"", the little computer hacker girl turns the Otomos against each other.  Quite a bit far-fetched if you ask me.Lastly, there were a number of cheesy things throughout the film that could have easily been avoided or better done.  For instance, the scene where the little computer hacker girl hacks into ED-209 and makes him obey her.  Kind of a cool idea, but could have easily been done better.  Oh, and why did they always refer to the CEO as ""The CEO"", just give the guy a name!!! Also, some of the comedy in the film was either too dark or misplaced.  I would tend to want to leave the comedy out of a film like this.END OF SPOILERSThe cast in the film was decent, I wouldn't say excellent, but they got the job done.  I thought Robert John Burke was a good replacement for Peter Weller, Peter will definitely always be the true Robocop/Murphy in my eyes, but Burke pulled it off and looks quite a bit like Weller at times.  Nancy Allen returns to the role of Anne Lewis and does a fine job, as was expected.  Remy Ryan (as Nikko) was ok, sometimes really good, sometimes terrible, nothing spectacular there.  Rip Torn (as the CEO) was a bit unexpected in the film, but did an ok job.  I don't blame Rip, I blame the writer of the character, there was just something off about him.  Mako (as Kanemitsu) did a fine job as usual, he played the perfect head-honcho Japanese business man.  Something about CCH Pounder (as Bertha) really bugs me, I'm not really sure what it is, but there was something I didn't like about the character...or maybe it's the actor...I'm not sure.  Stephen Root was another unexpected cast member, although at the time of this film he was somewhat unknown, now it's hard to see him as anyone other than Jimmy James of ""News Radio"".  Nonetheless, he did a fine job with is role in this film. Daniel von Bargen (as Moreno) did a great job with his role as well, there is something about this actor that I've always liked.  Jill Hennessy (as Dr. Marie Lazarus) was a nice touch, she did a fine job in the film and looked quite good.  Bradley Whitford did a pretty good job, a few bad lines here and there, but overall, pretty good.  He seems to be very good at playing a smug jerk.  All in all, the cast was pretty good, a few things I would have changed here and there, but the fault in this film lies more with the writing and the direction, not the cast.The plot in the film was nothing to write home about, but it was decent, it had it's moments.  I did think it was interesting that RoboCop was forced to choose between defending the public and serving his creators (OCP).  The film had an interesting idea, what happens when two of RoboCop's prime directives contradict each other?  Good idea, not perfectly executed, but a good idea.I was somewhat impressed with the special effects in this film, sure they weren't perfect, but there is some good stuff to see.  The scenes involving RoboCop and Otomo looked pretty nice.  Personally, I thought the flying RoboCop was pretty well done as well (could be that my expectations were quite low)...granted, they could have been better, but I'm sure the budget was somewhat low for the film.  There were also a number of really great stunts in the film.No, the film isn't spectacular, and it isn't as good as either of it's predecessors, but it's worth a watch.  If you are a fan of the previous RoboCop films, give this one a shot, just don't get your expectations too high.  Personally, I enjoyed the film, and I hope you will too, thanks for reading.-Chris",RoboCop 3
62,departed07,"Not good, not bad, but it's not right.",6,28 June 2008,"""Robocop 3"" is called the worst sequel in history along with fans calling it the worst Robocop movie ever made where they compared the two first films as classics. I grew up with all three films as a kid where only I'd admire the first two because they had Peter Weller playing the cyborg hero where I was used to him and not anybody else donning the outfit.It's not a good film, but some parts aren't bad at all.The film itself is like the first sequel where the city of Detroit is nothing but a big pile of crap with crime on the horizon, but this time around the cops are back on their feet. In the sequel, developers want to kick the people out of the city to make a better Detroit (gee, wasn't this like Robocop 2?) while at the same time killing a bunch of freedom fighters stopping them from the idea. Yet, it's up to Robocop (Robert John Burke) to do what he can with innovated weapons to save the city.The Good: Only certain action sequences make you want to see the film before changing the station. Trust me, there aren't any good performances nor is there a villain to cheer for. Plus the background music is worth hearing.The OK: It was nice to see Nancy Allen as Anne Lewis, Robert De'Qui as Sgt. Reed, Mario Machado as the male reporter from the two previous films and Felton Perry as the kiss ass Johnson while seeing a surprise list of celebrity guests from Rip Torn, CCH Pounder, Eve La Rue, Mako, Daniel Von Bargan, Bradley Whitford, Stephen Root, Jeff Garlin and others. I also like the freedom fighter characters. Robert John Burke wasn't that bad as the robot; it was a good thing he was in the suit the entire time without having to see his face, but I was embarrassed by the lines they fed him unlike Peter Weller.The Bad: Where do I begin? First of all, why did the film had to be PG-13 compared to the R-Rated films? Just because Robocop was liked by both kids and adults, doesn't mean you have to tone down the violence since it was the heart and soul of the franchise with all media, including kids shows making reference to it. I hated the little kid as well since the producers wanted to make it more ""family friendly"" where her character saved more people than any one else. The villain McDagget was a worthless P.O.S. compared to Cain and Boddicker where their crew would've wiped him out. The Japanese robots were funny and hideous while not being scary.Overall Review: Music is good, love seeing the cameo appearances, some action sequences were good, but it's not good enough. I prefer the first two movies.Sorry.",RoboCop 3
63,danielcereto,Pretty weak,3,1 April 2021,"Just watched all the original RoboCop movies and this one is by far the weakest one from the three. First, the script is bad and poor executed. Second, the Fx's are pretty cheap. Looks pretty bad. Last, acting is mostly amateurish and unbelievable. So, overall a pretty weak ending for the RoboCop movies.",RoboCop 3
64,Al_The_Strange,RoboCop 3 review,6,3 February 2014,"The part-man-part-machine-all-cop hero is back! Unfortunately, he's not the same. The third film in the franchise swaps out Peter Weller for Robert Burke, and director Fred Dekker doesn't have nearly as much guts his predecessors.The good news is that the film is still pretty fun. There is plenty of action to be had, with lots of shoot-outs, chases, and explosive scenes of all-out revolution. RoboCop continues to beat the snot out of bad guys (including samurai robots), and in one daring scene, he even straps on a jetpack and flies! However, the experience of this film is substantially fluffier and more lightweight than the last two films. As a PG-13 film, all the pulp and gore is stripped away, setting a totally different tone and style. This also leaves the door wide open for a plethora of scenes that are silly and cheesy. Even though the film maintains a decent pacing, and it can be serious when it wants to, most of it is ridiculous to the point of being unamusing and daft.The story has a few bright spots: it is pretty interesting to see how OCP becomes so Nazi-esque that they incur RoboCop's wrath. However, the film takes a few liberties that might be upsetting for fans (especially concerning one of the series' most beloved characters). Aside from that, the story plays out in a pretty standard fashion, and little is added to the established characters. Despite a few interesting ideas, there's little satire or thematic depth to be found.This film uses good, but rarely great, photography and editing. Acting is pretty silly and over-the-top from the whole cast; it worked great under Paul Verhoeven, but with Dekker's direction, this level of excess is not nearly as effective. Writing is average at best. This production has some okay-looking sets, props, costumes, and special effects. The music score brings back the classic theme of the first film, but doesn't really much variation on it.RoboCop 3 is the film where RoboCop commandeers a pimpmobile, catches a bullet with his bare hands, and where ED-209 becomes loyal as a puppy. This is pretty much on the same level as 1995's Judge Dredd; both films have the potential for some serious edge, but it is dulled pretty heavily by simply being too cheesy and lightweight. It's easily the worst of the original series, but still entertaining as a guilty pleasure.Recommended only to the most die-hard of RoboCop fans.3/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Average | Film: Marginal)",RoboCop 3
65,Rautus,Not as good as RoboCop and RoboCop 2,7,6 February 2007,"RoboCop is a classic and RoboCop 2 is a more darker sequel but it seems when making Robocop 3 they wanted a more tame film (Hint the PG-13 rating) but there's only one problem. You can't turn a violent and gory film into a film for the family, it doesn't work.Another problem with this film is RoboCop is too polite and comes out with the most embarrassing one liners ""You may want to call the fire department"" ""Go home young lady, you're in violation of curfew."" RoboCop 3 does have it's good points. It was great to see ED-209 and some of the action in the film was good also the jet pack was neat. The arm weapon that RoboCop had was a nice touch.RoboCop 3 is an okay sequel that's definitely cheesy, the only main problem is that the whole PG-13 idea doesn't work. They should have stuck to an R-Rating.",RoboCop 3

68,DigitalRevenantX7,Worst RoboCop ever.,3,10 August 2015,"Detroit has become a war zone as the OCP Corporation, taken over by a Japanese corporation, is violently kicking people out from their homes in order to start construction on Delta City. If they don't clear the entire suburb of Cadillac Heights within four days, OCP's stocks will fall & the company will be ruined. Amidst this, RoboCop has been trying to defeat the Splatterpunks, a violent gang of thugs who have been attacking the police. When he disregards a direct order to chase a group of resistance fighters who have stolen weapons from a police armoury in order to rescue his partner Anne Lewis from the Splatterpunks, the head of OCP's Security Concepts division orders RoboCop's head technician Dr. Marie Lazarus to erase his memories in order to make him less prone to violating orders. But Lazarus refuses to do so & is fired. When Lewis is killed by the mercenaries OCP has hired to kick people out of their homes, RoboCop joins forces with the resistance in order to stop the mercs & the Splatterpunks, who have joined forces to complete their mission.The original ROBOCOP was a science fiction masterpiece of the late 1980s, a film that has become legendary for its biting satire of what was considered to a future where corporations run amok & take over the running of whole cities, one such corporation trying to defeat crime by resurrecting a dead cop into an unstoppable cyborg who then goes after corrupt members of the very company that built him. The film became a blockbuster & a cult classic & spawned a whole franchise as well as matching the likes of THE TERMINATOR for sci-fi influence on the genre ever since.After the underrated ROBOCOP 2, the franchise practically blew its foot off with the likes of RoboCop 3. This sequel was universally panned by just about everyone & most die-hard Robo fans consider it to be utterly worthless. I personally don't entirely agree – the film has some game attempt to up the stakes on the story, with the cyborg taking on violent punks, corporate mercenaries & even a number of android ninjas in a story that should have been regarded as top-notch. But what looked on paper as excellent only ended up as significantly flawed in execution. Director Fred Dekker handles the action scenes well enough, even if he fails to match the legendary ultraviolence that the first two films were renowned for, but in his quest to make the film more 'family friendly', makes several attempts at putting childish humour into the mix. The scene where the young computer genius manages to reprogram an ED-209 robot was kind of cute but the rest of the gags just plain clunked.As for RoboCop himself, Dekker has made several critical mistakes that cause the film to crash & burn. Robert Burke does a pretty passable job of playing the cyborg but he is not Peter Weller in the slightest. Plus he has a really big chin that is distracting whenever he's not wearing his visor & chinguard. The first two films pitted RoboCop against some formidable machines – the ED-209 in the original & the replacement cyborg in the second but here the Japanese android ninjas are just plain mediocre – able to be defeated very easily & only have superior speed to make up for their weaknesses. RoboCop is also severely weakened in terms of toughness that is really annoying – he managed to survive severe punishment in the first two films but here is so weak that a mere rifle grenade can knock his power systems down significantly.The acting is okay for the most part. The only person I found to be subpar was Rip Torn, whose buffoonish portrayal of a cowardly & incompetent CEO was really grating on the nerves. Nancy Allen does a good job as usual but is criminally underutilised to the point that Dekker felt that killing the character off would help in balancing the film, something that didn't entirely work. Also underused were the Splatterpunks themselves, an interestingly wacked-out band of psychos who only appear in two scenes yet are built up into a major menace, something that fails badly. If you've got young children you want to introduce to the RoboCop franchise, this would be a pretty safe bet but there are some animated spinoffs that would do the job even better.",RoboCop 3
69,TheMarwood,A movie to pity,3,21 June 2014,"Poor RoboCop 3. Hating this film would be wrong, like picking on a shortbus full of mentally challenged children. It's a terrible picture, no doubting that, it's just a bit pathetic not contemptible. With Orion Pictures on the brink of bankruptcy and the RoboCop franchise one of the only properties that might get them cash to pay off some debts, they decided to ditch the extreme violence that RoboCop films are synonymous with and make a sequel the kiddies could enjoy. Orion couldn't even get this thing into theaters with their financial situation and after two years on the shelf, this family friendly RoboCop tanked at the box office. The lack of gore is not the problem here, it's a shoddy looking film stuffed with cheese and a plot about RoboCop fighting for the people is about the least interesting adventure they could throw this character into. Robocop 3 was a death blow to the career of director Fred Dekker and an example of trying to play it safe with horrifying consequences.",RoboCop 3
70,Coffee_in_the_Clink,"Dorothy, take this tin-man to Oz with you, please.",2,31 January 2020,"What an absolute shambles. ""Robocop 3"" is down there with the worst sequels. A total insult to the first film, and the main culprit was the studio, Orion Pictures. They wanted ""Robocop 3"" to be family-friendly and not to be given an R-Rating. So what we get is a Disney-version of Robocop; gone is the violence, the dark humour and the cynicism that made the first film - and to a lesser degree, the second one - what it was. Also, there's a child running around calling the shots and telling the adults in the gang what to do - a gimmick from the second film that I hated, but it is even worse here. Peter Weller didn't reprise his role as Robocop due to scheduling conflicts, and I'd say he was glad of it. But his absence in the suit is noticeable, the new guy just didn't cut it.
This is what Frank Miller had to say about his experiences working on the two sequels: ""Don't be the writer. The director's got the power. The screenplay is a fire hydrant, and there's a row of dogs around the block waiting for it."" I don't think I need to say anymore.",RoboCop 3

72,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,Death of the franchise - RoboGarbage,1,28 August 2019,"This is my raging rant why I hate this film to death why I think it is RoboCrap, RoboGarbage. Originally I wasn't planing to review this film but I am reviewing this film anyway. I love RoboCop (1987) the original classic masterpiece movie to death. I love RoboCop 2 I am huge, huge fan of RoboCop 2 and that movie is underrated. RoboCop 2 get's so much hate and crap but this movie is better? I don't think so. I re watch both of the movies so why not review the third garbage movie and finish the trilogy off.Yes I do have the film on Blu-ray disc I am not going to watch it ever again, I think I watch it in 2015 but I don't remember. I hate this film, it is so god damn awful and I don't want to break the disc or rip off the cover so I refuse to watch it. I can't stand this movie, I hate it so much. It is painfull to watch it so bad and this movie sucks. Fred Dekker destroyed the franchise with a god damn awful movie like this.My problems: This movie is PG-13 it is family film, it is not violent it is not a true sequel to RoboCop 2. It is not futuristic film, it is not Rated - R it is not bloody, it has lame action. So much that I am laughing my ass off. Some guy on here wrote ""I get why gets the hate but I like action"" and he gave 7 out of 10 what action? This movie has really lame action I will never say this movie is good or better than 2 never this is pile of dog sh**t. RoboCop 2 is a bad-ass ultra-violent sci-fi action film RoboCop 3 is lame garbage. RoboCock (2014) is a disrespectful awful movie worse than this.The story: it is garbage and makes no sense, The cast: Peter Weller, Daniel O'Herlihy and Belinda Bauer are missing and they are not in here, they do not return. The script is terrible RoboCop is slow in this movie. They replace his gun and he has mini machine gun on his hand I don't know why. This little girl comes and she reprograms ED-209 and making him into loyal little puppy. I don't want ED-209 been a man's best friend and loyal as a puppy. ED-209 is a bad-ass robot not a puppy. There are 2 samurai ninjas in here and RoboCop get his ass kicked. Yes RoboCop did do nothing in here. In RoboCop 2 Robocop jumps on a back of a monsters addicted robot RoboCain rips his brain out, smashes into the ground to the pulp. In here he did do nothing.The little girl had to save RoboCock from 2 samurai ninjas in which they both kicked RoboCop's ass and they destroy them selfs. RoboCop dosen't kill anyone he fly's with a fly jet pack I am like why? This movie is so bad, why some people gave this movie 10 out of 10? I don't get it. If you love the film fine just I ask my self how can someone love this film? Robert John Burke is not a RoboCop. Peter Weller Is RoboCop not Robert John Burke This movie gets better treatment than RoboCop 2.They killed of Nancy Allen our favorite character Anne Lewis. The only reason Nancy Allen agreed to appear in this movie was because she wanted her character been killed off. Really dickless move Nancy. She shouldn't do that, but she did not care about us fans. Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles III and this movie come out the same year and they both bombed thank god. Robert Jon Burke is so terrible, they guned down his partner and he just stand there not doing anything.

73,ReelCheese,Robocrap!,2,11 June 2006,"This highly-disappointing sequel finds our hero going against law and order by siding with a group of down-and-outers who stand to lose their neighborhood because of evil corporate interests. Along the way Robo crashes cars, battles robot ninjas and flies through the air like a six-ton Superman. Alas, none of it can save ROBOCOP 3, a film into which very little real effort seems to have gone.When watching ROBOCOP 3, one can't help but think the producers lazily expected the well-established Robocop brand would simply sell itself this time around. Making matters worse, they tried to move away from a more adult-style of action and sci-fi and deliver something you might watch with older kiddies. I mean, robot ninjas??? What is this, Mighty Morphin Power Rangers? This thing even attempts to deliver a do-the-right-thing message, but the whole effort is so muddled and ridiculous it can't succeed (nor should a movie like this even try).I am willing to cut movies a lot of slack, but this one's a stinker.

75,geminiredblue,What... No Peter Weller?!,2,25 February 2014,"What a brilliant and exciting film ROBOCOP was! It was followed by the ho-hum sequel ROBOCOP 2. Three years later, desperate to cash in on the cyborg craze started by TERMINATOR 2, the studios decided make a third ROBOCOP movie. If you were a kid during the early 90s, the commercials gave you the impression that it was gonna be really cool. Especially when they showed Robocop using a jetpack. When I finally did get around to seeing it, well let's just say it was a big letdown. Maybe we should've taken it as a bad sign when Peter Weller refused to return for the third one. Okay, here's the story: The head honchos at OCP are still hellbent on turning Detroit into Delta City. Unfortunately, there's a large group of homeless people who are none-too-happy about having their hiding spaces destroyed. Robocop eventually comes to their aid and joins their resistance movement. OCP has joined forces with a Japanese Cybernetic Company, which includes cyborg assassins. It all culminates in an epic battle between cyborgs. There's very little, if anything, to recommend this one, unless you include an ED-209 being turned into a good guy. This film runs out of steam too too early and can't even live up to the lowered standards of ROBOCOP 2. Take my advice, just stick to the first ROBOCOP and pretend like the sequels never existed.",RoboCop 3
76,stormhawk2021,RoboCop saves the Care Bears,1,21 February 2018,"You know how the first two RoboCop films were ultra-violent affairs of varying quality? They both had funny moments, and they both had blood and bullets flying everywhere? Say goodbye to those with RoboCop 3, a film that went for a PG-13 rating. The filmmakers removed any sort of comedy -- whether that was done to keep it family friendly or not is up for debate -- and all of the action has been significantly toned down. So, yes, the kids can see this, but anyone who saw the first film, and the second one, too, I suppose, will want to give it a miss.Detroit is still a war zone, although the drug from the second film is not to blame. OCP, the evil corporation from both earlier films, is driving people from their homes with their ""Rehabilitators"" (people who force people into quarantine zones) so that the company can flatten houses and build apartment buildings. It's cleaning up the city in its own way, although it seems immoral to anyone who is actually watching it.RoboCop (now played by Robert John Burke instead of Peter Weller, not that it matters considering you rarely get to see his whole face), is also cleaning up the streets in the way that cops normally try to. His partner, Anne Lewis (Nancy Allen reprises her role, for a brief time), is also there, although they're more sympathetic to the rebel forces that are forming. Eventually, and soon enough into the film for it not to be a major spoiler, Anne is killed and RoboCop joins the ""good"" guys in order to take down the corporation that has caused everyone just so much grief.From here, you can pretty much see where the film is going to go. The only new element is that OCP has been taken over by a Japanese company, so the villain that will actually challenge RoboCop -- considering bullets and ordinary weapons are grossly inefficient in dealing with him -- is a ninja played by Bruce Locke. Yes, we're at the point in the series when we're having the barely mobile robot getting involved in hand-to-hand combat scenes with a ninja. What is this, the Power Rangers?How did nobody not think that this would be a bad idea? The first two films had guns, guns and more guns because they at least understood that the hero couldn't participate well in close combat situations. He can't even run; how is he supposed to have a fist fight? You've got to give the film credit for at least trying something different -- and it was no doubt done in an attempt to remove some of the bloody violence to acquire that PG-13 -- but this was simply the wrong way to go about it.It didn't have to be this way, either. RoboCop actually gets a couple of upgrades this time around -- which I won't spoil -- and it would have been easy to make up a way to make him more mobile. This would have allowed for him to at least hold his own the fight scenes. Instead, we just watch the ninja run around, occasionally hit, do a flip every now and then, while RoboCop does nothing back. It's a stupid, stupid decision to have this as the final major action scene in the movie, and it makes the one from last film look genius in comparison.The first movies had a sense of humor. While the first was far more enjoyable, the second almost matched it in terms of being funny. I can't remember one scene or line from RoboCop 3. The only somewhat dark moment came when a businessman, while talking to his wife, decides to jump out of a building, killing himself. The first or second film might have played it for a laugh; this one does it for shock -- except it's not shocking and it's quickly forgotten by everyone.I'd like to find a positive in the movie but I just can't. Perhaps saying that Robert Burke reminded me a lot of Peter Weller is a positive? Can we use that? Once the mask is on, it doesn't matter who is behind it. In fact, I'm almost surprised they took it off at all, as it wouldn't have been hard to leave it on for the entirety of the movie. If anything, Peter Weller was smart for not deciding to return for this installment, and I have to wonder if he tried to get his co-stars out as well. Most of them return, so if you like series continuity, at least there's that!RoboCop continues to be a boring character, although at least we go back to how he ended the first film and have him at least able to emote a little bit. He's decidedly more human than robot in this film, which at least makes him a little likable. But he's wooden, has difficulty being harmed -- although he does get hurt by this one in a way that didn't hurt him in a previous installment, which was weird -- and is just a less mobile, less powerful version of, say, Superman.All of the freshness that was in the series is gone by this point. RoboCop 3, like a lot of third installments, is the worst in the bunch, and has very few, if any redeeming features. It made me hate the lead character more than I thought I could, even though it returned him to the way he ended the first film. The action and humor have both been toned down, removing exactly what made the first film -- and to a lesser extent, the second, too -- special. Don't give this movie even a second of consideration; it's an all-around dud.That there are people who say that RoboCop 3 is almost as good as the first one is to HALLUCINATE and lets see the film knowledge that these people have. And that there are people who already say that it is better than the first ones, it is simply to give them a medal of ignorance.P.S.: Answering to a reviewer who posted these two last messages that this sequel is a equal to their predecessors, yeah sure, is a equal for you because you like the robot ninjas...if you are a girl and like ninjas, go watch a Japanese TV show named ""Ninja Sentai Kakuranger"" (a.k.a.

In an attempt to bridge a wider audience, the signature violence and gritty nature of the previous RoboCop films is diluted down, however it's hard to imagine anyone post Terminator 2 feeling the faintest of thrills from what is a clumsy looking, badly written exercise in endurance against tedium. Surprisingly, a few supporting players from previous 'Robo's' clock back in for another shift, although one presumes it's purely for the money and their presence does little much other than to remind of just how far the apple has fallen from the tree. To it's minor credit, RoboCop 3 tries hard not to take itself too seriously and while there's a few gags that raise a smile, these moments are thinly spread and mostly serve as distant echo's of Paul Verhoeven's vastly superior original. As the end draws near and your brain has had enough, Robo turns 'Superman' as we witness him donning a jet-pack while dishing out justice to the bad guys from the skies.

83,refinedsugar,They saved the worst for last.,2,14 March 2001,"I think all can agree this was the finale to Robocop's theatrical tour of duty. First the company that distributed these films Orion Pictures is now bankrupt and defunct. That doesn't help matters any. Secondly this is a bad film. No let me rephrase that. Robocop 3 is a really bad film. Too much change has killed Robocop.Peter Weller as Murphy/Robocop has now departed and Robert John Burke has taken his place. They've tried their best to make him look the same - I'm talking specifically about those scenes with Robo's face plate removed and might I add what a good makeup job they did - but it's still not Weller. I think they choose Burke because of his lips. They look good and that's about the only thing you see with the whole getup on.Since we're on the topic of departures, where's the Old Man? You know the guy who ran OCP. We're given this little morsel, ""You remember what they did to the old man?"" by his replacement Rip Torn who deserves better. As for Robocop himself, well, he's been ""upgraded"". I can only assume because these upgrades were needed to mask the seriously weak story and perhaps to sell a new line of action figures. Was Robocop with only his pistol no good anymore? Did he really need a machine gun hand or a high flying jet pack? Come on. What else is there to say? We went from a R-rated franchise with dark humor and violence to downright boring PG-13 formula.The third time out finds Robocop trying to defend the poor, sick and beaten masses who are being driven out of the way by OCP forces who naturally want their land. Wait until you see the robot ninja nemesis too. Desperate or what? I guess it gets harder and harder to find adequate story lines for a metal law enforcement butt kicking machine and that's the breaks. Because for all intense purposes Robocop is done, finito.

84,robotbling,Contains one of the worst fight scenes ever put on film,1,28 December 2011,"(www.plasticpals.com) I knew it was a bad sign when Peter Weller passed on the role of RoboCop in the third film. Having finally watched this train wreck for the first time, I don't blame him. It's almost hard to believe how many bad ideas and clichés are woven into this turd. Beyond all of that is the more troubling realization that, as far as protagonists go, RoboCop is a dead end with no room to grow. Although he is capable of making decisions based on emotions, he is basically a zombie with no personality – not exactly someone you want to spend a whole lot of time with.OCP (the fascist corporation that has been trying to take over Detroit) still hasn't gotten anywhere. You'd think by the third film OCP would be in the midst of building their dystopian Delta City. It certainly would have made for a more interesting setting than boring old downtown Detroit. They've formed a Nazi-like regime (led by a snooty Englishman) to forcibly evict people.We're soon introduced to Nico, one of the film's more annoying characters. Of course, she's a kid genius who can hack into robots and computers using her laptop computer. After being separated from her parents, she befriends a group of libertarian revolutionaries that are trying to resist OCP by hiding in the sewers. When RoboCop sees the plight of the people he decides to join their cause. The audience, on the other hand, will find it hard to identify with the rebels. Why are they willing to give up their lives for such deplorable living conditions? In a lame reference to Detroit's failing auto industry, OCP has been taken over by a Japanese rival. To make matters even more stupid, the Japanese company sends over a Terminator-like ninja robot to fight RoboCop, even though RoboCop and the police force are owned and operated by OCP. Don't get excited; the inevitable duel between RoboCop and the ninja is (and I say this without hyperbole) one of the worst fight scenes ever put on film.The story is also painfully predictable. In one scene, a nameless officer approaches Murphy's old partner and asks, ""Hey, want this body armor?"" which she declines because she's ""off-duty"". You guessed it, she gets shot and killed in the next scene. When the rebels steal a futuristic jetpack from the police armory, you know that somewhere down the line RoboCop's going to be flying around like a jackass, which he does in the ""grand"" finale. The visual effects are even more embarrassing when you consider that Jurassic Park was in theaters that same year.The RoboCop series started out OK, but it quickly degenerated into a creatively-bankrupt mess once director Paul Verhoeven left and Frank Miller started writing them. While RoboCop 2 was pretty awful, the third film is almost unwatchable. The characters are annoying, the action is boring, the special effects are terrible, and the plot makes no sense. It's a prime example of how not to make a sequel, and I implore you not to waste your time watching it. I decided to review it and it was on Netflix instant stream, so that's my excuse. I shudder to think that this franchise is slated for a reboot.",RoboCop 3

The first movie is great and having seen it again recently still holds up well, and even the sequel is not as bad as I once thought it was, but this however is tripe. Peter Weller is wisely gone to be replaces by the non-descript Robert John Burke (who has never been seen near a movie since). And Nancy does not stick around for that long either. Leaving us with a directionless movie which has no good characters stirring up the same kind of stories we have already seen. This time a news Asian corporation has taken over OCP with the same corporate ruthlessness, along the way the only good thing is Robo going anarchist.

This is the kind of crusade best left to J.J. and the rest of the cast of Good Times.Having Robocop go renegade to stop the inconveniencing of others is beneath contempt and stupid.

The director must have realised that this was a bad move half way through making the movie so he added a few more of these unmemorable villains to make up for the fact he didn't have a big impressive killer robot in it and failed miserably.Sorry but that sums it all up for me. There is of course a load of other faults that i won't go in to but that was the main fault when i watched it.A few little cool bits in this movie but the bad far outweighs the good.

Just a few things really. plot, acting, good special effects, direction, directing, writing, a reason to be made, someone to set it on fire. Isn't it kinda sad when the original of a series that is somewhat known for its special effects is better than a sequel that actually made it to the big screen?

You are presented with a family living in an apartment with a young girl working on a monochrome screen child's toy of a laptop computer. Shortly after the girl asks if they will be all right in their apartment a wrecking ball is put through it with them there. They are then forced to go to ""resettlement"" buses where she is separated from her parents.The small girl runs into a resistance group. They are breaking into an OCP police weapons depot. Where an ED-209 is stationed. She some how evades the detection of the ED-209 and she crawls under it between ED's legs. This young girl somehow knows the inter-workings of the ED-209 and magically knows they access point is on his lower right leg. She also carries wires, not the D pin connections that are present there, but 2 wires. By using these ""jump"" wires she has with her she can magically access ED-209s programming. The script is bad, she tells the resistance group he will be ""as loyal as a puppy"" and by merely typing this in ED-209 is under her control. She then directs ED-209 to fire on the weapons depot garage door, which is made out of wood which is an odd choice.I could not watch it after this point I turned it off.

I can make my peace with the flying RoboCop but the robot ninjas were ridiculous. Especially at the end where the little girl and RoboCop's designer reprogram them under 10 seconds using some sort of a wireless interface without having any access code. That is simply undignified, even Microsoft Windows has better security measures.I'm gonna watch the Prime Directives next and I sincerely hope this family/action/sci-fi style RoboCop 3 has will not be continued.

In this movie there is a lot of action, fight between robots, car chases and a lot of jokes and it is really enjoyable. Robo himself is very cool and his human friends are likable.

98,The Terminator,Pretty Much What Everyone Expected...,4,24 September 2000,"Robocop was a fantastsic movie - great special effects and characters but at the same time a believable and powerful plot. The aftermath of this film was somewhat tragic though - a superb futuristic cop opened so many doors for producers, be it for cartoons, tv series or motion pictures. Trouble is, Robocop was used to death. The fact that he had been turned into a cartoon for kids completely took the edge off the violent and well thought out character Paul Verhoven had created for the original movie, which is why its first sequel sucked. Robocop 2 was, well, torture to watch. It was absolute garbage. Robocop 3 however, brought new life to the franchise - the loss of Peter Weller as Murphy was a blow but Robert Burke's portrayal almost lived up to that of Weller's. The plot is fairly decent and the fact that many of the original cast were present makes it a true sequel. Although much of what we see is expected, it is nevertheless a good action movie and deserves more credit than it has received. Worth watching, but don't expect miracles.",RoboCop 3
99,CinemaCocoa,EMBARRASSING for the iconic character!,3,13 July 2014,"Firstly, look at that poster. That face in the background... could he pucker those lips anymore?? CavemanCop more like.I think the hardest pill to swallow with the deplorable RoboCop 3 is that Frank Miller was the screenwriter...This film's backstory is so poorly executed I have trouble reciting it now... OCP turns on its own people and merges with a Japanese corporation, implementing a ""rehab"" military force to evict Detroit citizens so they can take over the city. RoboCop, really doesn't do very much.So for starters, Peter Weller doesn't reprise the lead role, and while this doesn't affect it greatly; the mask is pretty well enclosing, but you do notice it. RoboCop has more lines, and it is really surprising how badly acted Robert John Burke's mouth is... he juts his chin out as if to fit the costume! It looks idiotic.The character of Alex Murphy continues to be mistreated, RoboCop 3 feels like a cash in worse than the second film; they have so little idea what to do with his character, they bench him for most of the film! Enter Nikko, a ten year old girl who can hack into and reprogram ED-209 units (for example), and a host of other characters who form a resistance force against OCP. Nancy Allen returns as Murphy's partner Anne, but is criminally underused.The villains are hopeless. They just are. We have the most stock British bad guys I have seen in a long time, allied with shadowy Japanese businessmen who send ninjas (yes, actual ninjas) to defeat RoboCop. Okay, so RoboCop taking on ninjas, as cumbersome as he is... could be exciting right? Well, the film builds it up all right. Massive, massive disappointment.The tone of the film is completely off. I said RoboCop 2 was lacking Paul Verhoeven's satire? Well this film proved me wrong! The humour here just... dies. It literally dies. Its deader than Elvis. My god. You'd have to be drunk or high to appreciate it. A man who is in the police station shouts at the sergeant: ""RoboCop?? You got an AlienCop too? How about a GhostCop??"" What... what does that even mean? How's the violence, you ask, it has a 15 certificate after all? I actually don't know why it has a 15, this is easily a 12A by today's standards. Sure there's a few bloody gunshots and splats of red on people, but otherwise this is virtually kid friendly. ""Crime"" in Detroit is initially shown with a lady pushing a trolley of empty cans, only for her trolley to be hit by a car and for someone to mug her. Oh. My. God. Someone call RoboCop, quick! He'll save her, diving a pink cadillac, that cartoonishly falls apart. That also happens...This is the Terminator: Rise of the Machines of the RoboCop series, and I feel bad for Alex Murphy. I feel bad that his story was never told, that screenwriters just got lazy and wrote a shoddy shooter script with no heart at all. This was the first time I watched this film, I'd seen the other two, and honestly I wish I hadn't; it is embarrassing for the character.",RoboCop 3
100,Jakethemuss,What went wrong?,2,27 October 2007,"Robocop, the visionary sci-fi film, was and is a masterpiece. Ultra-violent, stylish and visually brilliant, it is one of the best films of the 80's. It was followed by a lesser sequel, Robocop 2, which was inferior to the original but at least kept its head high enough to be a countable sequel.Then comes Robocop 3, an abysmal third outing to the series. Having seen all 3 within a fairly small time scale, I can say that this film has a totally different tone to the first, and none of its appeal. It seems to be aimed at easily impressed 14 year olds (or younger) in a similar way Joel Schumacher's 2 Batman outings were. The strong violence of the first one is replaced with cheesy, watered down action scenes you would expect to see on a second rate Saturday night TV series. As for Robocop, he has lost any character or gravitas he had in the previous films, and is now just a dumb machine played by a different actor (Peter Weller made a good choice to avoid this one).Add a cutesy little girl in one of the lead roles, robotic Japanese ninja's (one of whom is introduced in a meditating position, despite being a robot) Robocop zooming around on a jet-pack and hammy acting galore, hey presto, a recipe for disaster.",RoboCop 3
101,chrisow,Mass marketing failure,5,31 July 2002,"----Possible Spoilers----O.C.P have been bought over by a Japanese corporation, and intend on beginning construction for Delta City, the 'perfect city'. To do this, certain places need cleared. Cadillac Heights is one such place. Hiring a group of mercenaries from the Amazon Nuclear War, O.C.P have six days to clear it for demolition, or O.C.P's stock plummet and they're ruined. A small band of residents do not take kindly to this and are determined that the destruction of their homes does not go ahead. Officer Alex Murphy (Robocop) sides with them, since the mercenaries (called the 'Rehab Unit') killed Officer Lewis and nearly put Murphy off line.    Once again, it appears Frank Miller's vision has been taken over by a director, intent on aiming this for a kiddie market. The story is very interesting (due to Miller, I suspect) but Fred Dekker reduces the blood letting, the language is cleaned up, and there's a cute little girl who befriends Murphy. Aggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhh. Hell, there's even new attachments for Murphy (jetpack, removable hand, machine gun) and he's lost the inner turmoil that made him someone to root for and care for.
    A note to M.G.M: the best way to look at Robocop is as Batman. Both are similar characters, and both were destroyed by eager production companies intent on making a few bucks from eager kids, and then sell them as action figures.    The action scenes, although pretty short, are quite enjoyable, in that Saturday night 'nothing on T.V, so we'll go and get out a film' sort of way. The whole film has a cheap look about it. This doesn't suit, since you need big action scenes and gunplay and a futuristic look in Robocop. The ninjas, Otomo, are interesting villans. They are like Japanese Terminators, and would have been great in a few more scenes.    Admiringly, it tries to go back to the tone of the original and even borrows certain elements from Verhoeven's direction, but it just doesn't work.I give Robocop 3 a 4 out of 10.(Watch Robocop: Prime Directives (2000) for the true sequel.)",RoboCop 3

Robocop 3 is a fine sequel - it certainly fails to be equal to the all-time classic original, but it works well enough on its own terms. The story is interesting (about a privatized police force), there is a strong orchestral sound-track (one of the key success factors of the original), and the way-out weaponry and awesome destruction is all present and correct.Where it falls down is with the unnecessary insertion of action film cliches: the cute kid, the sexy female scientist etc. Worst of all is a pointless showdown between Robocop and an oriental kung-fu android, which is completely irrelevant to the plot at hand.The negative reaction is greatly undeserved: its no masterpiece, but it does its job. The main point is that Verhoeven's vision of a capitalist society gone mad is retained: this is such an inherently interesting concept, setting anything in this milieu is still fascinating viewing.",RoboCop 3

(Yes, I just mentioned that film)Honestly just reading the plot in one go, you'll think this must have been attempted as some sort of parody.At least, that's what most of the cast felt it was gonna be as nearly everyone is running around playing the frantic game we all know and love called ""Who Can Overact The Most?"" and everyone would have probably won the grand prize of a dream holiday as there is tons and I mean TONS of overacting from everyone across the board.Robert John Burke is quite embarrassing as Robocop himself, hell even that bootleg Robert Cop toy could have given a better performance.It's not the rubbish acting from everyone that killed the film though...It's the fact some idiot at Orion thought ""You know what could make this film even better? Let's cater it to the younger audience, we don't give a crap about the older fans.

Quite simply you've got Japanese ninja cyborgs making funny faces, RoboCop allowing himself to get attacked like a rag doll and a kid that has a super computer that can hack into all sorts of high tech stuff, jeez. I do vaguely remember seeing this film years ago back when the film was new to rent on VHS but back then I didn't know the film was this bad, don't get me wrong the only thing this film got right was the story but one other sad thing about this film is that the violence in the film was drastically toned down and with the such elements I've previously mentioned, all of it made the film look silly and it is no wonder they never made another RoboCop film after that until the 2014 remake but I don't consider that one a real RoboCop film. Had the film been in better hands and retained itself as an R rated property then this could have been a great film but it just wasn't, instead it's quite possibly one of the worst movie sequels ever.

105,phobicsq,Was Once the Low Bar of the Series,2,29 September 2021,"During the 90's there was a big push to make R rated films into pg-13 to get more money at the box office. It usually didn't work and it certainly dialed down the excitement among fans of the films, Robocop 3 is such a tale. I remember being excited about the film early on but once plans were dropped about doing a proper sequel, the story changed as did the actor/director and the rating.Obviously Peter Weller was not impressed with the changes so he left and it was a good idea because the final product is horrible that is until the remake of Robocop occurred which was even worse than Robocop 3.Why is this film so bad, well it's not entirely the rating although it does take you away from the core of the franchise but it's also the horrible acting and story. I'm not saying Robocop or its sequel was amazing storytelling but it had a decent foundation and decent actors/acting. Robocop 3 takes all of the good things from the first one and its sequel by ignoring them.

106,Eightiesjunkie,RoboCop 3: The franchise killer!,1,13 June 2014,"It seems that every movie franchise has one, a movie so bad that it kills the series. RoboCop 3 sadly, is no exception. OCP has begun to move forward in their master plan to create a better Detroit, this plan is known as ""Delta City"". Unfortunately for the citizens of Detroit, this means destroying their homes. There is strong opposition to this, so OCP deploys armed mercenaries known as ""Rehabs"". Their job is remove people from their homes by force. One of these people, is a computer whiz kid named Nikko. After her parents are arrested by the rehabs, she is found and taken in by the leader of the resistance movement. Meanwhile, it is revealed that OCP has been bought out by a Japanese corporation. (This comes into play later) So a short time later, RoboCop and Lewis track Nikko down at an old church. Unfortunately so have the rehabs and their leader, McDaggett. He and the rest of the rehabs have orders to kill all the people in the church, but RoboCop and Lewis refuse to stand down. RoboCop can't fire on the rehabs because of ""Directive 4"" (I'll explain what this is later.) McDaggett and the rest of the rehabs open fire on them and thus, Officer Anne Lewis is killed. I'm sure many of you can guess why this infuriates me on multiple levels! Not only does RoboCop do absolutely NOTHING to save the life of his friend and partner, but the biggest problem, is that her death has zero meaning or purpose! This is one of my favorite things to complain about in a bad movie or sequel. If you're going to have a main character die, IT MUST HAVE A PURPOSE!!! For example: in Star Trek II, Spock dies to save the lives of The Enterprise's crew. In Aliens, Gorman dies to atone for his mistake. In Cruel Intentions, Sebastian dies to save the woman he loves. In RoboCop 3 however, Lewis dies only to get her out of the film, and to add a cheap revenge motive for RoboCop to get the bad guy. So...anyway, RoboCop takes a bazooka to the chest, McDaggett and the rest of the rehabs leave him for dead, He joins the resistance and decides to fight for their cause, the Japanese corporation dispatches a robot samurai to deal with RoboCop and the resistance, the cops all quit when they're forced to work with the rehabs, RoboCop takes out McDaggett and the rest of the rehabs, and of course, saves the day. Now let me explain what that ""Directive Four"" crap was, and why it makes no sense here. In the original film, Directive four was a fail-safe put in by OCP's corrupt vice president. Which meant that RoboCop could not apprehend, or act against any member of OCP. Here's why it makes no sense: First of all you would think, that after the events of the first film, that RoboCop's designers would've taken that out, so something like that wouldn't happen again. Second, after being left for dead by the rehabs, RoboCop simply deletes the directive. If he could do that at any time, why didn't he just do that earlier, and why couldn't he do that in one of the previous films? To sum it all up, RoboCop 3 pretty much sucks all around. The climax was halfway decent, but the rest just sucked. The lead actor doesn't even come remotely close to filling Peter Weller's shoes, the humor isn't funny, Anne Lewis dies for no reason, the main villain isn't even the least bit threatening, and 90% of the time RoboCop is always getting his a$$ kicked! I don't blame Frank Miller for the movie being bad, everyone knows that the studio determines how a movie is made, and how it will turn out. In fact, If you're a fan of RoboCop, and want to see ""What could've been."" I recommend you pick up one of Frank Miller's RoboCop graphic novels. I've read one of them myself, and it was excellent! You'll get much more entertainment from reading one of them, than you'll get out of this cinematic pile of crap! Like most poorly done sequels, RoboCop 3 could've been great, but all it turned out to be was a last-ditch effort to squeeze out more money for the studio. If you haven't seen it, skip it. If you have, do yourself a favor and pretend it never existed!",RoboCop 3
107,crazychap,"not as bad as some want you to believe, but still far from satisfying",4,17 July 2009,"This review is written assuming you've already seen Robocop (1987) and Robocop 2 (1990). If not, don't proceed until you see those first:Robocop 3 (1992) picks an unknown number of years after the events of part 2, Cain's gang and his Nuke Drug has been obliterated and Robocain has been defeated by our hero. The Old Man from the previous two films is gone (either died or resigned after the events of Robocop 2; the movie doesn't say) and is replaced by the ""CEO"" (Rip Torn). The Delta City Project inaugurated in the previous film is falling behind schedule and OCP incurs in debt, leading to its takeover by the Japanese corp. of Kanemitsu. Meanwhile, they adopt increasingly forceful methods to get back on track by hiring mercenaries called ""the Rehabs"" led by Robert McDagget (John Castle) to evacuate areas for demolition and send the locals to ""correctional facilities"". A band of freedom fighters spring up, Robocop and Anne Lewis track them down after seeing a little girl joining them in an abandoned church. Unbeknowst to them, the Rehabs have tracked them down, and orders them to leave the building to them. Robocop and Anne Lewis refuse, but when Anne gets seriously injured (and dies a few minutes later), he quits the force and joins the rebellion, while undergoing structural repairs in his programme.Robocop 2 may have shocked some viewers for its excessive violence, but it is better than this one. The storyline is more coherent than the last film in the sense that all main ideas make it to the end but it's too simplistic. While Part 2 was ultra-violent and gloomy, this one went into the opposite direction. Sure the absence of the first two films' graphic violence would make it more appealing for kids, but this movie just has little to make up for it; it starts off very promising but it gets sillier as the it progresses, culminating in a ridiculous fight between Robocop and the Samurai, which is a far cry from the excellent finale between Robocop and Robocain in the the second movie, giving the impression that the filmmakers have run out of money by that point.However, Robocop 3 still has some worthwhile moments to spare it from becoming a candidate for MST3K. Most of the action sequences save the aforementioned fight are well-staged and creative, and the film has some creative use of CGI. Robocop's new gadgets-- the jet-pack and his cannon-- are worthy additions, and our hero still knows how to make an entrance (diving from the highest level of a parking lot and dropping down 10 storeys below).Peter Weller, however, did not reprise the role, most likely because he has grown tired of having to walk into that baggy costume for hours and hours on end and sweating buckets in the process, and he's replaced by Robert John Burke. Burke is a worthy successor to Weller, mimicking his movements down to the smallest details, but it just doesn't feel the same without him.Bottom line: Robocop 3 is the worst of the series, but it's not as terrible as some people tend to exaggerate.Trivia: the beautiful Jill Hennessy appears here as Robocop's leading programmer just before becoming famous as Kincaid in ""Law and Order"" and later in ""Crossing Jordan"".",RoboCop 3

And I find it really poetic. Beautiful rise and fall. .

109,sublimital_death,9 out of 10 stars,9,17 May 2002,"First I feel I should start by saying that rh_backup should be smacked, several times.. As a child Robocop was one of my all time favorite super hero's.. I was just a kid when I saw the first movie (my parents let me watch anything) Lots of Blood, great fight scenes, shoot outs, action packed! Dam what a movie.. Part Two, same thing, exactly the same thing, only this time he had to stop another robocop, who was the leader and maker of a drug called Nuke!! Same characters were in it, same look to everything, Robo was perfect!! To say 2 was bad is like saying one was bad, and once you say that, you have no place here!! 3? 3 was good, I liked this movie a lot..Robert John Burke did a good job as Robo, because Peter Weller refused, as it was believed he didn't like the suit, because it was made from real Metal, It weighed a ton, and he told Orion, that he was not doing part 2 even, but they got him to do it.. This is rumor, so I don't know how much it true.. Robert John Burke was almost perfect, even when the helmet was on or off, but the voice needed work.. I still liked it, and I have great Respect for the man.. But the movie was made cheaply, and it shows, it was not even rated R, Why? cause more kids liked the movies than first thought, so this movie was made for them.. He fought a android, Samaria warrior.. And had such screw ups as 4 men I believe picked him up and carried him.. In 2 it took the entire police squad that was picketing, and they still said he was heavy!! Also he had Prime Directives, but in 2 he fried then out of his system, so he couldn't have had directives at all.. Oh well,,.. Little more blood, and we would have had a contender with the other two.. I give this movie 9 out of 10 stars, because loss of blood...",RoboCop 3
110,mikeferguson,"The best of the two sequels, and why...",10,17 February 2021,"Robocop 1 is a classic of the genre (the Robot Movies genre), but it is borderline soulless. Robocop 2 actually IS soulless, while still containing some cool robot effects that make it watchable. Robocop 3, however, with its holdover of the most likeable characters from the previous films, plus the welcome addition of some top-notch character actors and a script that finally infuses some real heart into the proceedings, is in my opinion, the best of the lot. Some of you will wisely agree with my analysis, while others of you who disagree clearly will need your micro-neural barriers removed, so your emotional balance can be restored.

Well now I've seen it and yes, it honestly stank all the way thru.While the original 'Robocop'-flick had some idea, this 3rd one (and hopefully the last one!) entertained me as much as seeing a real bad mime act. Really, I thought I had seen all the thrash there is. Well... Obviously I had missed this one.Not quite dumb enough (altho very, very close to that) to be funny, just embarrassing really. But then again, I'm pretty sure that most 6 to 9 year-old males will find this movie to be ""way cool!"". So, if you don't fit in that criteria, I suggest passing this film. ""Dead or alive...""

I liked it more then most people i know but the fact that they entered more comedy into the film to replace the overkill dont make sense at all how does comedy replace overkill.  It has a good story though. It is somewhat disappointing but not half as disappointing as aliens 3 now that was a bad third film.,RoboCop 3
113,donahue-1,Redefines the definition of a truly awful movie,1,27 November 2013,Robocop I was truly amazing - I enjoy watching it - even to this day. However - Robocop 3 fails at ALL levels; writing - directing - acting. Whereas Robocop I was a love story - (yes) - Robocop III elicited zero emotion. Although some basic plot elements were sound - folks being evicted from their homes by a mega-corporation - others - youngster who would have embarrassed even David Levinson (Jeff Goldblum) in Independence Day - with - her computer skills - filed miserably. One does not truly appreciate the acting skills - (to include supporting actors) - and - directing - until a wonderful script - (minus a child prodigy) - falls into the hands of others much less capable. In all - a terrible film - which - only helps me to better appreciate the original.,RoboCop 3

Its bad, its worse than bad. I mean there are so many missed opportunities here its hard to count them all. And so many boring tired clichés that it boggles the mind.Its almost like the director was hired at the last minute and had no love for the project or material, to say he phoned it in is a huge understatement.Just one example out of potentially thousands, why have Robocop chase the van with his hand out the window hole? Why wouldn't he just smash the windows out totally so he could aim and shoot at will? Was the windshield of the car giving him protection? Did he need it there to keep the bugs out of his teeth? Its like nothing was thought through in this film, they all seemed to show up, get their paychecks, smile, and go home, and nothing else.A sad, painful and pitiful death for what could have been a great series.",RoboCop 3

First of all, the character of Robocop is played by someone else and the result is just plain embarrassing. The film is very soft on violence, which was a poor decision on the director's part because the original film is notorious for its excessiveness and loved by fans. A PG-RATED Robocop is just a desperate attempt to cash in on the wider audience, which proves that the film was made by profiteers, rather than film-makers. This film is so bad, it's literally dripping with cheese. Robocop flying is an unintentional funny moment in the film and the part where Robocop drives a car off a bridge and lands on all four wheels, is just plain ridiculous. This film was the nail in the Robocop franchise's coffin. I honestly wish that it had never been made.",RoboCop 3
116,gothamite27,I don't care what people say...,7,3 December 2004,"I don't care what people say. I think this film is cool. It is flawed, but it is still far cooler than RoboCop 2 (or RoboCrap as I like to call it). The drama in this film makes it unique amongst its predecessors, and it is much better than the likes of 'Batman: Forever' (another film unique in its own franchise). **SPOILERS**The plot sees OCP going ahead with Delta City. They hire a mercenary group called 'Rehab' to 'escort' the people from their homes and into rehabilitation camps. The police hate this idea and once a stray bullet hits officer Ann Lewis, RoboCop is seriously p***ed off. The plot is simple, but it is superior in its simplicity. It is the campy one-liners and gags that let this film down on more than one occasion. Things like RoboCop commandeering a pimp-mobile and Sergeant Reid having to deal with a drag queen prostitute are just a few of the things that had me fuming at the television screen. I'd say it is for this reason that a lot of people hate this film with such a passion. Another reason that this repelled Robo-fans was because it had very little political satire other than the fact that the main characters were trying to beat the system for the good of the people. There is very little 'MediaBreak Advertisement' sequences, and even the ones that are shown have strong relevance to the story. This is probably because this film is aimed squarely at children so that more action figures can be sold. However, I quite enjoyed the drama of the people rebelling against the corporate monster OCP for the rights to their own homes. I especially loved the part where even the Detroit Police Department thought that OCP had gone out of line, throwing their badges at an OCP executive, and leaving the building to go and help the civilians reclaim their homes. This is something you don't usually get in a superhero film (if you want to call any of the RoboCop films 'superhero' films). **MAJOR SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!!**It is pretty obvious that they gave RoboCop a removable gun/flamethrower attachment (it attached to his hand) to sell action figures. The same applies with the jet pack seen at the end of the film. However, I felt that they were incorporated into the film quite nicely, and the flying scene, however fake, is pretty cool if you take it with a pinch of salt. Especially with Basil Poledouris' theme music booming in the background.**END SPOILERS** Overall, RoboCop 3 does not deserve to be in the 'Bottom One-Hundred Films' list. I believe it should be in 'The Best Sequels' list. If you enjoy RoboCop because he's a superhero and not because the films he appears in (usually) have strong political satire in them, then this is the film for you. 6/10.",RoboCop 3

They spent a lot of money making everything pretty, but they forgot to write a script, hire talented actors, and install a director who can tell when everything's going into the toilet and make some changes.For the premiere they had a stuntman in a Robocop suit fly in on a jet pack (actually a wire and some bad pyrotechnics). I should have known from there that it would be awful. The smell of desperation was in the air.If you liked the first two Robocop movies, do not see this movie.

119,teppo-2,Downtrodding the franchise,2,27 July 2009,"RoboCop 3 is one of the best attempts I've seen at laying waste to a good franchise - only bested in that regard by the infamous Batman & Robin and Batman Forever. It lacks pretty much everything that made the first two films good (and yes, I considered RoboCop 2 to be a good movie).Firstly, the ""new guy"" just isn't RoboCop. Sure, he does the movement part quite well, but the face, the voice... it just isn't the same. This shouldn't reflect badly on his ability though, but it's just the way it is.Second, I could spot many, many parts where to movie tried to be funny. Where the original and the first sequel managed to mix humor into the mix, this installment just fails to be funny no matter how much it tries. It ends up being simply embarrassing.Then there's the whole deal with Lewis. I'm surprised Allen took any part in this. Her character is effectively thrown aside in the middle of the movie like a used... erm, well, you get the point. Since she apparently insisted her character has to die ""early"", I guess she wasn't too happy about the whole project either ;)The new head of OCP is also just plain bad. He also attempts to be funny I guess, but he's just pathetic and annoying.The theme of the story has potential to be decent, but it is just simply very poorly executed. Overall the characters are boring (and RoboCop much weaker than in the previous movies), which doesn't help the story at all.Oh, and don't even get me started on Otomo. Good grief. Not only does he change his facial appearance to something completely retarded every times his face is damaged, but he's in general a pathetic thing in every way. On first seeing him you expect him to be a badass, but boy, how wrong that assessment is.Long story short: this movie is just one long anti-climax that never should have seen the light of day.",RoboCop 3

This third installment has nothing it holds back on everything that made it what it was no scenes that shocked you apart from the bad ones like the script lines some of them are really bad. Just avoid this it is that bad. Robocop changed a genre and a blockbuster was formed from a low budget movie but with this installment all that is broken and we are left with something that dose not deserve to be part of the robocop series. There are scenes that you wont forget only because they are that awful. If you like your hero destroyed and get though the boring unentertaining parts there are some fun to be had such as a flying robocop which can also been seen on the trailer for the movie. Robocop 3 just ruins a good movie its no wonder Peter Weller decided not to do this but he still will be Robocop in my eyes i hope he has a camero in the remake and i hope the remake can make up for this horrible mistake that is Robocop 3.,RoboCop 3

Loving the first film of the series, one wonders how much of that film was influenced by the work done by Miller just one year before in the acclaimed The dark knight returns graphic novel (this novel is from 1986, whereas Verhoven's classic was from 1987). And I believe that by the use of the T.V screens as a technique for the story to progress and also by the concept of a future city, where the criminal run amock. So as the sequels are written by Miller himself, this technique even accentuates further. This second sequel is perhaps better than the first one, due to a much tight script and story. Plus, the return of Basil Poledouris to the scoring duties makes a nice touch to recover the spirit of the original. All in all, an entertaining comic-book translated to the screen.

I've always loved that robot. I thought it was so bad-ass when I first saw it.But the BS starts right after we see the ED-209, when that kid takes control of the droid with her computer toy made out of plastic. I mean is that computer toy something or what? It can hack into security cameras and broadcast videos all over the TV channels, it can hack into ED-209's memory, and the list goes on.There are so many things that don't add up in this movie. But the thing that most bothered me was robo's mouth. It looked like he was trying to take a number 2 throughout the whole movie. He looked horrible. Couldn't they have piked somebody else for the job? Everything about this movie is horrible. I didn't like anything I saw in it, the story is horrible and it stinks so bad it makes me wanna puke.Bottom line is... I won't even count it as one of the robocop movies because it doesn't deserve it. It's nothing but a pile of crap and it shouldn't belong on this planet.",RoboCop 3

I'm surprised that they didn't bother putting a new cyborg called the Robocop 3 like they did in Robocop 2. Even Peter Weller was smart enough not to star in this movie after what happened in the last sequel! And interestingly enough, Robocop wasn't the first name to appear in the cast in the end credits. Even the makers of this movie knew that Robocop 3 was awful! And even worse was the Robocop TV Series that aired a year later! It didn't do good as well.

But if your introduction to Robocop was this nightmare of a movie, then it goes about a thousand times more.Robocop isn't Robocop anymore in this movie. Oh, he looks like him, but all his attitude is gone, sacrificed to the god of TV and PG-13 political correctness. And that means that with it has gone the ruthlessness of the world he was within. In Robocop, cops are killed frequently, crime is rampant and the world is falling apart - a ruthless, tireless policeman who can shoot with computer-aided accuracy to kill is a solution to the problems of the world, and he meets a brutal world with the brutality needed to break it.

Basil Poledouris returns to score the proceedings and his music is even better than what he composed in the original. The action isn't as gory as in the original movie, but it still packs a punch. RoboCop 3 is a very diverse movie. The females are brainy, strong-willed and not afraid to get into the thick of things. The villains are also different and intriguing. As a fan of martial arts movies, I can say that I like the idea of Cyborg Ninjas hunting down RoboCop. The fight scenes are a little clunky, but at least they're not as tasteless as the battles in the vile ""RoboCop 2."" The Christmas setting and the people vs big corporations plot make RoboCop 3 a joy for the whole family. Teens will no doubt love the action set pieces, while kids will relate to the character of Nikko. Adults can take much enjoyment from John Castle's excellent performance as the baddie and also the satirical humor. RoboCop 3 is a 3.9 on IMDb and I think that's a damn shame.

However, if that movie had so much violence it does not mean that the next should have the same amount or more violence.OMG he is flying, how could they. I do not see what is wrong with Robocop having a jetpack, i thought it was pretty awesome. Also he has gotten another upgrade. Instead of only that gun he now has watched Scarface and said hello to the little friend. So to compensate for the lack of violence he uses this weapon. Also, there were ninjas. RoboCop vs Ninjas. Yes they could have been better and have more equipment. However I do not agree with people who say the first ninja was overpowered and RoboCop should have no trouble with him. RoboCop is slow and the ninja is fast and can cut through steel. Also Robocop just met him and did not know him and his moves. And yes the ninja is also a robot. What I really liked is what there was less of. Prime directive 4 is gone. You know, that thing that kept him from arresting that Dick in the first movie. Now I am not saying it is the best movie, but it is not that bad. I actually really liked it, except when officer Lewis died because she was stupid enough not to wear her armor.

Most disappointingly of all, Robocop 3's PG-13 rating also fails to deliver heart-pounding extravagant action that was always present in the first two films.The movie moves slow - it doesn't bother to excite the viewer by providing fast paced story telling or explosive action. Severely lacking in this department, you shouldn't expect any exciting firefights or boss battles. In fact, the Kanemitsu cyborg which is sent to destroy Murphy in what we expect to be an exciting and action-packed finale ends with no cathartic explosive climax, but rather a whimpering premature ejaculation of listless fighting scenes. Murphy spends half the movie disabled from a fusillade of gunshots that have never left a scratch on him in the past. No fake commercials or newscasts that touch upon our cultures corrosive mentality makes you nostalgically pine for what you remembered to be a whacky, funny and ridiculously over-the-top movie franchise.The terrible story, the boring unfolding of the events, the lack of action and violence, and the missing element of subtle humor and comedy makes Robocop 3 an epic failure in all departments.",RoboCop 3

But there are both plot holes in the realization (where do the directives in the third film come from that were filmed in the second?) and the stupidity of those very power corporations.

I enjoy watching changes in the robocop movies such as Lewis's ever changing hair, from short in the first film to somewhat longer in the second, to a perm in the 3rd. Another funny moment is near the end where robo kills two OCP officers for flirting with some teenage skank. I'm really sorry it had to turn out this way, you know, like a Disney movie or something.",RoboCop 3

The reason why it is awful because of the plot is very slow and bad acting.I would only recommend this if you are totally bored. The first one was an original idea and not so boring as the sequels. Probably it is only good to watch these sequels at least once but never more than once just to let you see what I am talking about.

142,rvnj729,"Not the Worst, but obviously and easily not the best",7,30 May 2010,"I don't think Robocop 3 is by any standard, a bad movie. I just think it has earned a bad rep. So to start off, I'm going to assume that 95% of the people that watched Robocop 3 saw and enjoyed Robocop 1 or 2. So let's actually see what 3 has in common and not with 1 and 2.-3 does have the absence of Weller, which made all fans upset. -It is PG-13, and one of the things that made Robocop so fun was the dark violence. -This one has random ninjas and Asian children named Nikko. -This one does have an unrealistic plot, but not entirely. (I'll touch upon that later). -Characters, at least for me, weren't so likable and you definitely didn't care about Robo as much as you did in the last 2 films.-3 does try and somewhat succeed in being like Robocop with the news reports and the opening scene that doesn't pertain to the plot. -The quips Weller delivered that Burke does fairly well. -Although PG-13, still a fairly gritty movie. -Brings back some of the humor and wit that was noticeably absent in Robo 2. -Has DECENT CGI, but if you want to argue about bad CGI, take a look at the scene in Robo 1 when Dick falls from the OCP building.So, when people complain about the unrealistic plot about OCP breaking down people's apartments and sending people to camps, its a lot like Sin City (another Miller movie). The government and all courts and stuff are most likely corrupt and could care less about what happened here.So all in all, definitely not a good Robocop movie, but you won't suffer from watching this. Hell, you might even enjoy it.",RoboCop 3

As soon as I found out that Peter Weller was not going to be Robocop, I knew the movie was in trouble. When it was released, I did see it in the theaters. I wasn't too pleased with the movie..........period. Peter Weller not being in it was a big factor for me. Nancy Allen's character dying early in the film was another. Really, the entire movie seemed to be off for some reason. Perhaps the PG-13 rating had something to do with that, I'm not sure. I was hoping that would be the end of this franchise. Sure, I watched the TV series for a short time, wasn't too impressed. Then, in 2014, the ""new and improved"" Robocop would be released and everything would be back to normal in the Robocop universe!!!!! Right? Wrong!!!! What a major disappointment!! I did not see the movie in the theater (Thank God) but did rent it. What a waste of time. One of the most boring, action movies I have seen in many years. I would prefer to watch Robocop 3 any day, instead of this weak imitation of a Robocop movie. Again, some of my negative review of ""Robocop 2014"" could be because it was rated ""PG-13"". Maybe if it was R rated it could have been a better movie????? Then, again, I may be wrong.",RoboCop 3

147,nydrydoc,Murphy goes from cop to kiddie super-hero,3,11 November 2000,"Robocop was a smash hit because there was more to the character Robocop than `Robot Cop.' ED-209 and Robocop looked and sounded cool, eye (and ear) candy.  But this did not assure success. Murphy the man, finding his humanity even after being sentenced to the iron suit, made the audience care about him, and gave Robocop a loyal fan base.  That was what made Robocop more than your average sci-fi shoot-em up. Robocop 2 was received with less enthusiasm, but most Robocop fans and the general movie going public liked it.  It was violent and dark, like the first, and the effects while somewhat dated today were unbelievable then. Then came Robocop 3.  First Orion rushed the film into production before Robocop 2 was out of the theaters, then was forced to delay the release by two years after being bought out by MGM. When it was released in 1993, Robocop 3 was a spectacular disappointment. The dark violence from the first two films was dropped in favor of a more kid friendly version, infuriating fans.  But worse, Robocop was no longer Robocop, police officer, he was Robocop: Super Hero. The idea of giving Robocop a gun arm is an obvious toy marketing ploy, as was the ridiculous jet pack.  The goal of these things was to make Robocop a super hero, but when you do that you lose Murphy the man, the most important element to the movie.  Trying to make Robocop into a whole new character but make up for it by having him sympathize with a little annoying kid, have overdone memories, experience sexual attraction (?!?), and make him highly talkative (Robocop is the strong silent type, but in Robocop 3 he says things like `I am fine, thank you.' and, `I don't have many... friends.') was the final straw.  Robocop fans were stabbed in the back, and Orion forced a real piece of kiddy friendly trash on us. Robocop also started destroying OCP police equipment, for no reason.  He destroyed the police car, something Robocop from the first two movies would never do. His partner (Nancy Allen) hardly gives her best performance, and at what should have been her best, most moving scene, was just overdone and stupid. The show made all the same mistakes, and I hope the new Robocop Prime Directives will make up for this.",RoboCop 3
148,pstevensondyolfknip,Shows Potential,6,27 September 2007,"Robocop was a brilliant movie. Action packed, satirical and with strong characters.Robocop 2 was evidence that less is more. Not very good at all.Robocop 3 is stuck in the middle. Whilst it's not up to scratch when compared to the first film it's a vast improvement on the second offering.OCP taking their Delta City plans to almost Nazi like extremes makes for a strong emotional point and Burke makes a solid replacement for Weller in the lead role.It's well directed and Basil Poledouris makes a more than welcome return to the musical score (after the camp effort that we were treated to in the second film).Murphy shows some signs of the humanity he'd regained by the end of the first film and seemed to have completely lost throughout the second film. And McDaggart is a great foil for him to do battle with (he's still no Clarence Boddiker but a mile better than Caine) Perhaps the film gets a little too carried away with toys for Robocop such as the jet-pack (Clearly designed to be action figure merchandise) and the computer genius kid soon gets on the nerves.But had the studio been aiming for yet another adult action movie and increased the gore and bad language this wouldn't be far from the heights reached by the original.Even as ""family"" entertainment it's decent and has a strong storyline above all else.",RoboCop 3

While I enjoyed Peter Weller's role of RoboCop in 1 & 2, Robert Burke in this one, doesn't seem to have any clue what he's doing.  Also I don't like the story in it, turning RoboCop into a 'nice' guy, it don't work, we prefer watching RoboCop the way he was in the first one, we're not used to Robo acting 'Mr. Nice Guy'.

The acting was decidedly wooden in places although the actor who played Robocop wasn't to bad (could have been worse and could have been better).The whole movie is aimed at kids with all the gimmicky attachments for Robocop (flight pack and arm attachment) being nothing more than product placement for the tied in merchandising.Im giving this a 3 out of 10 because the only decent thing about the movie was the soundtrack.,RoboCop 3

In reality, the film is a pure ""cult classic"" if there ever was one. There are so many moral issues that flow subtly and neatly throughout the film, the violence is graphic and extreme-yet somewhat believable. The underlying comedic elements such as the TV commercials and newscasters are hilarious. The 2nd Robocop was good as well, although it fell more into the Hollywood tradition of trying too hard to do a sequel to match the first. A lot of the things I loved about 1 weren't in 2, but it was still good. Now we have 3. In every way it is the COMPLETE OPPOSITE of the original and what Paul veerhoven set out to achieve with it. First off, PG-13? Cmon. The plot is filled with more bullet holes than the people that got shot up, Peter Weller isn't back and it shows, the acting is terrible, the action is terrible, not only is it by far the worst Robocop film ever, it is one THE worst films ever, period.

And Robocop 3 was just awful.But it could have worked, because the plot isn't that bad. I think that the movie could have been okay, if they: 1. Didn't replace Peter Weller in the leading role. Robert John Burke's performance was awful.2. Didn't have the ninja robots in the film. A robot ninja just didn't worked in Robocop. It just was lame.3. Didn't put Robocop in the air. Suddenly Robocop can fly, it was just stupid.4. Could have the last moment of Bertha in some other way. I mean, after she is been shot, she is leaning forward and holding her thump up, and acting like there is nothing wrong with her, and then suddenly she just jump backward and she is death. A bad performance for that scene.5. Didn't remove almost all of the action, violence and spirit form the others movies. It went from rated R to PG 13, Com on Robocop wasn't meant to be a children's movie.That's my opinion, if they didn't do all the stuff that I have mention, and some other stuff that I didn't mention, I think that the film could have worked.I give it 2/10.",RoboCop 3

I can't bear myself to go into the gory details of the film or I might have to return to therapy (my last stint was after my original viewing of this film) but the only element which saves this from a 1/10 (I gave a it 2) is Basil Poledouris's fantastic 'Robocop march' but that features prominently in Robocop 1, so why bother with this??My answer: AVOID AT ALL COSTS",RoboCop 3

160,Robo_1,"So, lets just ignore the plot then?",10,30 August 2003,"Robocop 3, is far and away a better film than most people give it credit for. The very fact that it's the third in the series, that it had the violence toned down, and it's not Peter Weller seems to have really put peoples backs up. It shouldn't, and those people who seem to be on some vitriolic campaign to slate this film are ignoring it's most important merit. It's plot. The plot carries on the established Robocop saga, in a far better way than it predecessor did so, and I think it's about time a little light was shone on this fact. Mc Daggett is a strong and believable villain and Robert Burke did an excellent job in replacing Weller. The plot is extremely well structured and paced, and tells a genuinely interesting story of corporate greed stampeding over peoples rights. Now I'm not saying Robocop 3 had any big social message, but the rebels were entirely believable, Robocop's side switching was handled very well, and the whole story just gelled naturally. It wasn't exempt from problems of course. Niko was maybe a bit to much for most Robocop fans to accept, the SFX and action scenes were well wanting of a couple more mill being spent on them, and the end fight between Robo and the Otomos just flat out sucked. However, what should matter to most people is the story and acting. On both of these levels Robocop 3 scores and I genuinely wish people could see past the number 3 at the end of the title and give this film more of a chance.

164,optic14,Good attempt at extending the plot line. Some flaws do prevent it from scoring more...,6,26 June 2006,"Robocop 3 is clearly aimed at a younger audience with the addition of a child, as well as the weapon attachments for Robocop. Such weapon enhancements include a repeating submachine gun, a smart bomb and flamethrower. Though impressive at first it fails to make an entirely good impression as they aren't used very often. For instance when Robocop raided the OCP office at the Detroit Police Station he used his flamethrower against the map and various other bits but doesn't actually kill any of the Rehab soldiers.Which brings me to another point, the violence in this film has severely been toned down compared to previous movies. Even Robocop: Prime Directives has more violence than this. To a certain degree there is a theme of darkness in Robocop 3. OCP wants to finish Delta City but the residents refuse to move out so instead they are forced out through heavier and tactical means. As others have mentioned before Robocop has become extremely weak. I thought Robocop was impervious to bombs and bullets? When he suffers a direct impact from a M203 grenade his system efficiency drops substantially, around 53%. The typical theme of avenging a downed officer (Lewis) almost works well, until the end.The animation used when Robocop flies around is extremely... crude. I suspect that getting Robocop to fly would've cost less than him being on foot to actually help the Detroit Police against the Rehab army. Such a battle would've been far more impressive. Come to think of it, I don't recall Robocop actually killing any Rehab soldiers at all except until the end. Compared to Robocop where the kill count was extremely high with blood everywhere... well... you know.On a more positive note, the excellent soundtrack from the first Robocop movie is back. It's used quite well. 6/10 because of the soundtrack and a good attempt at extending the plot line. Some flaws do prevent it from scoring more, such as some of the things he do. E.g. him shooting the top of his Police Car in a circle in order to break through it and say ""Police officer, no loitering."" That's just cheesy. The same silly shooting tactic appears when he breaks down a door by shooting a rough outline for him to break through.

167,krisramzie,This film is amazing,10,14 January 2008,"Robocop 1 and 2 were great, and this movie was not at all far from that.Sure Weller wasn't in it, but Robert Burke was a brilliant Robocop, he had great delivery on a lot of lines and he played a very kind character, and he kept very faithful to the characteristics Weller gave to the Character, but added his own stuff. But through the majority of the film it feels like Robocop, luckily they knew not to show flashbacks before he was Robo, for the different appearance would become more obvious, but they kept the mask on him a lot and he looks no different then Weller with it on, and even when not wearing it he still really suits the part. His voice is different but suits a cyborg.and Anne Lewis, despite lack of wanting to be in this since losing interest while doing sequels, she still plays her part emphusiastically and dramatically, (SPOILERS:) and her agreement of being killed off added a very touching and artistic death scene.the acting in general is Amazing, CCH Punder in particular plays a very touching role, John Castle is a brilliant bad guy, the rest are all good. The Special Effects are the best of the robocops (though it is the newest). and the Directing is very nice, i feel similar elements to the original, but with action genre conventions.and its been complained that this is a more innocent film (PG-13), but a good film doesn't need violence. Yes its always nice, but this film compensates through other things. It's got to be the most 'goose-pimply' of all of them, (SPOILER:)especially in the scene where the Police warn the people of OCP and assist them in battle, its a nice start to a climax.This is the most epic one of the 3, though maybe not the best, definitely the most actionable and funnest to watch.",RoboCop 3

171,linkz1,"Easily the worst of the franchise, but a boatload of fun none the less!",4,14 April 2007,"Before I begin, let me get this out in the open: Robocop 3 is easily the worst movie of the trilogy.OK, now the rest of the review.Though this is the worst movie of the series, Robocop 3 manages to find a way to redeem itself (be it intentionally or unintentionally) by being incredibly cheesy, and ultimately a load of fun! The film doesn't even really seem to be a direct continuation of the series, though it does reference the first movie several times via flashbacks. The story is just about as dull as it could get, and the acting leaves much to be desired. Not to mention, the one saving grace this film could have had (special effects) does nothing to help save the movie from falling to ""B-Movie"" status.I'm not sure why Peter Weller was not brought back for this one, but I think he was wise to avoid it. Robocop has been reduced to cheesy one-liners, and badly choreographed fight scenes. However, I think this adds to the movie's charm. The film seems to take a very tongue-in-cheek look into the world of Robo, and this saves it from being a complete failure. Also, it seems as if the writers or director were watching a lot of Japanese anime, one of the main villains in the film is a ninja who is seemingly unstoppable; many of his scenes are so stylized you'd swear you're watching an anime. Rip Torn also adds to the film's silliness as the head of the corrupt corporation, OCP. He makes the main conflict in the film not even seem threatening due to the fact that he isn't menacing at all.Overall I'd say this film is more of a comedy than a sci-fi flick. It contains so many cheesy moments that it's best enjoyed with a small group of friends (my close friend opined once ""This is what Mystery Science Theater 3000 was made for,"" how right he was). If you are a fan of the series because of the grittiness and realism displayed in the first, avoid this entry. However, if you're looking for a good cheesy popcorn style sci-fi film, by all means, get some friends together and have fun! This film was made to be laughed at!",RoboCop 3

In robocop 3 OCP was at it again by throwing people out of their house and then what was really stupid is that these killing ninja guys. What was worse is that they soften up and rated the movie PG-13, it became more for younger people than older adults. I really think they screwed up somewere and thats to bad. Sometimes these people just can't get the 2nd or 3rd movie right maybe because they are just greedy.

173,JoeDraven,Money back not enough,1,25 January 2011,"I wish I could rate this movie lower than 1 star. A waste of a few hours and the money spent to see it. Many people walked out yelling abuse at the screen and throwing the odd item. Everyone involved in this movie should hang their heads in shame and never work on another movie again.... Lost for words to express the complete and utter disappointment with what I sat through on that dark dark day.I loved the first two movies, a big fan, great concept and freedom to do what hadn't been done before. I guess the PG-13 rating allowed the movie makes to cash in on lunch boxes and drink bottles and a toy Robocop that had interchangeable arms. I mean, isn't that more important than making a good movie? Please don't associate the word ""Good"" used in my last comment as related to this movie. For this movie I would use the terms, dung, but then I don't want to offend any dung beatles, how about the dung of the bugs that eat the dung of the bugs that eta dung beatles dung....",RoboCop 3
174,fender_bronco,One of the worst science-fiction movies ever,1,23 January 2005,"When I was very little, I became a fan of the first 2 Robocop films. So when I heard they were going to release a third movie, I couldn't wait. Then I saw the movie, and couldn't believe what I had just saw. I was terrible. The story was actually good and could have worked. But they had to do what ruins a lot of other movies:add a little kid character. It also featured a very horribly written character of a robot ninja. And without Peter Weller from the first two movies, this movie just wasn't the same. And a PG-13 rating? The whole point of the Robocop movies was to make some of the most violent and swear-filled movies you'll ever see. So my advice to you would be to watch the first two Robocop films, and pretend this one was never made.",RoboCop 3
175,nickpaul-johnson,I've seen worse!,7,27 November 2015,"I honestly don't understand the all-negative reviews regarding this movie. I thought it was quite decent. Let's discuss the reasoning via Pros and cons.Pros: the movie itself fits right in the time-line with the first two RoboCop movies. We know that OCP is the big villain in all three of them because of their idea of wanting to take over Detroit with their Delta City design which would involve taking out old neighborhoods (as the character Mayor Cuzak pointed out in RoboCop 2). In the this installment, it seems that OCP tries to actually GO THROUGH with the Delta City redesign by means of brute force through a group know as the ""Rehabs"" who forcefully drive individuals and families out of their homes and on buses just so they can build their Delta City. Robocop with his new gadgets and tools made by Dr Lazarus take the side of the citizens as any good police officer would and finally deal a final blow to OCP towards the end. Plus we get to see a better character development out of RoboCop and Alex Murphy.I actually thought it was rather action packed and the plot line was pretty clear. You want a horrible movie? Watch From Justin to Kelly or 50 Shades of Grey!!! Robocop 3 is way better than those two.Cons: The plot line seemed a BIT predictable and Peter Weller was not there to reprise his role as RoboCop. Also sucked that Officer Lewis gets killed by OCP. I kind of zoned out at the non-action parts, but nonetheless, the whole movie was watchable.Give it the benefit of the doubt and try watching it before knocking it.",RoboCop 3
176,r0cket13,"Masterpiece isn't the right word, but it's the first that comes to mind",10,7 November 2005,"What can one say about perfection? How can you critique Leonardo di Vinci? How is it possible to to describe the taste of the most extravagant fine wine? I've seen many movies in my life, many great movies, but none as spectacular as RoboCop 3.Robert Burke gives a tour de force performance as RoboCop that rivals the works of a young Marlon Brando in The Godfather and Streetcar Named Desire.What is it called when all the right pieces fall into places and perfection takes place? I don't know, but RoboCop 3 can best describe that. 1993 was a great year for movies, but sadly RoboCop 3 was not recognized at the Academy Awards. What an absolute shame!",RoboCop 3
177,BradBarritt,No. Just no.,3,14 October 2015,"The first Robocop was amazing, Robocop 2 was a worthy sequel. I use to sit and watch these movies with my father. It was something he and I bonded over. This movie just ruined a good Saturday night. how do you go from solid R rated flicks to a PG 13? People loved it for the action and violence. Why ruin a perfectly good formula? Along the way Robo crashes cars, battles robot ninjas and flies through the air like a six-ton Superman. Alas, none of it can save ROBOCOP 3, a film into which very little real effort seems to have gone. It's obvious someone just sat back and expected this movie to sell itself. It didn't. Not one bit. Save your money. Save your time. Run far far away from this movie.",RoboCop 3
178,burr1aj,"Still bad, but not as bad as your friends have told you.",5,6 June 2008,"Okay, when I first viewed this movie, I was expecting a B-movie performance from the many comments I have read. I was not whole heartedly let down by this movie. It does include a lot of the things you have most likely read or heard about: a Campy Story, Cheesy Acting and delivers that ""Made for TV"" feeling. However, this movie also delivers viewers a fitting closing, with that right Robocop feeling.This movie achieves what Robocop 2 tried to do but failed for numerous reasons, but still leaves me wanting more. More from the actors, more from the special effects, more from the story. I am just left with the feeling that had everyone from the first Robocop been involved in it. The Robocop feeling is here, but its really lacking in a lot of facets.Overall, just watch this movie. Its classically ""bad"", but it isn't BAAAAAAD, if you know what I am saying.",RoboCop 3
179,theshadowsega,A terrible sequel that ultimately destroyed Orion Pictures,1,19 November 2016,"I love Robocop 1 as it's my favorite Sci Fi movie with an R rating because Peter Weller is best Robocop. Robocop 2 was good not as great as the first one where Robocop acted stupid but at least he kicked Cain's ass. Robocop 3 is awful. The villains were stupid and lame one of them wears a muscle vest,McDagget look like an evil twin of Steve Martin,Coonz is a dweeb,Robocop is is an idiot who gets his butt kicked by robot ninjas as OCP is brought by a Japanese multinational corporation known as Kanemitsu. The only good thing was killing off Officer Anne Lewis as Nancy Allen apparently agree to it if they wanted to write her character off as she hated the script. This movie not only destroyed Orion Pictures until MGM revived it in 2013 but it destroyed Fred Dekker's career. It should have stayed on the shelf or never been green lit at all.",RoboCop 3
180,imdb-12483,Easy now,5,10 December 2008,"I think you guys are all being a little too harsh, Robocop 3 was way better than Robocop 2. Now, i'm not saying it was a GREAT movie, but it was far more captivating than Robocop 2. Robocop 2 was filled with a bunch of no name, terrible actors lacking any shred of talent, Peter Weller and Nancy Allen aside, and an absolutely horrid script. In robo 2, it's as if they blew the whole budget on ""Cain-bot"", and casting Peter Weller and Nancy Allen. On the contrary, Robocop 3 was filled with a bunch of, what I consider, great TV actors (I emphasize 'TV'), whom were able to hold it together. I thought Robert Burke did an outstanding job playing Murphy. I could slam Robocop 2 in so many ways, but with Robocop 3, I really can't find as many things wrong other than being the third movie in a trilogy that should have not continued past Robocop 1, unless of course the film company followed these prime directives:1) Obtain a big enough budget to avoid it looking like a ""made for TV movie"" 2) Only use classic villain actors of the era (Ronny Cox, Miguel Ferrer, and Kurtwood Smith rocked!) 3) Make no attempts at political correctness 4) Have a captivating boss fight at the end 5) Have Paul Verhoeven directing",RoboCop 3
