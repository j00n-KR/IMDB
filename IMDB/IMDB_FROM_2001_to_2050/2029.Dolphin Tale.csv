0,SnoopyStyle,"Cheesy, hokey, corny, love it",7,3 March 2014,"Sawyer Nelson (Nathan Gamble) is stuck in summer school and his belove cousin Kyle, who is a champion swimmer, is going to war. One day, he helps rescue a dolphin entangled by a crab trap. The dolphin named Winter loses her tale and she needs her rescuer. Dr. Haskett (Harry Connick Jr.) reluctantly agrees to let him help. Kyle loses his leg in the war. Dr. McCarthy (Morgan Freeman) working on Kyle's prosthetic leg is recruited to develop a prosthetic tail for Winter.It's a very lovely family movie. Sure it's pulling on all the heart strings. It's got a pelican sidekick, the adorable kid leads, war heroes, disabled kids, and the dolphin. It may be cheesy. It may be hokey. It may be corny. But I love it all. If you have a heart, you'll love it too.",Dolphin Tale
1,kosmasp,So it's a word play?,7,29 March 2012,"I'm not sure if Dolphins like cheese, but I sure hope you do, if you are going to watch this movie. Seriously though: The movie has quite a few moments that might flip other movies over into complete kitsch. I don't know how they managed, but they stayed on the right side of kitsch if you wanna call it that.And it is a kids movie after all. While I don't cut them too much slack (remember even if you're a kid watching, in 10-20 years you might wanna re-watch your ""favorite"" movies again and be bitterly surprised), this one just gets by it. There are a few story points that really are too much, but overall the movie is just too confident. Plus you've got to love Dolphins anyway (well at least I do) and their ""tales"" ...",Dolphin Tale
2,tavm,Dolphin Tale is an inspirational story of the handicapped Winter,7,24 September 2011,"All right, I just watched this movie and I just found that some characters were either made up or embellished into one person but despite that, I found this tale of the handicapped dolphin Winter quite inspirational. Certainly having to use a prosthetic tail in order to swim properly is worth showing for anyone who wonders if such a thing was possible and also being told by the characters why that tail is important is worthy info. I also found out the character who invented it looked nothing like Morgan Freeman but since he's not someone really famous, I'm guessing it won't be too much of a big deal for anyone who knows how ""true stories"" are always exaggerated for dramatic purposes. I mean, while there might not have been a withdrawn boy that helped this Winter come out of her shell, seeing him in the person of Sawyer, played by Nathan Gamble, does provide someone to empathize with when comparing attitudes that progress for the better. And seeing him befriending a similar-aged girl named Hazel (Cozi Zuehlsdorff) and her father, a veterinarian played by Harry Connick, Jr., also is wonderfully touching to see. There are some scenes, like Hazel and Sawyer's playing with a flying model helicopter, that seem meant for laughs (which I thought was only slightly amusing), but overall, Dolphin Tale is a good family drama that doesn't get too sugary-sweet in the extreme. Oh, and I'm soooo glad that Connick's widowed dad didn't suddenly fall for Sawyer's abandoned mom (Ashley Judd). That would definitely have been too much! And the 3-D images were fine but weren't really necessary.",Dolphin Tale
3,michaelRokeefe,Heartwarming family fare.,7,14 August 2012,"This is a ""fuzzy feel good"" movie about the love between a lonely boy and an injured dolphin. Sawyer(Nathan Gamble)on his way to summer school finds a trapped dolphin on the beach tangled in a crab trap. The injured dolphin is taken to an animal hospital ran by Dr. Clay Haskett(Harry Connick Jr), who is forced to remove the dolphin's tale to save its life. Haskett's young daughter Hazel(Cozi Zuehisdorff)agrees with Sawyer that if only the dolphin could feel and swim normal it would survive. By the help of Dr. Cameron McCarthy(Morgan Freeman)hope comes to reality when a prosthetic tail is successfully accepted by the dolphin. Connick Jr is faultless in this role. The cast is rounded out by Ashley Judd, Kris Kristofferson and Francis Sternhagen. An uplifting movie for the entire family.",Dolphin Tale
4,utgard14,Very Nice,7,5 June 2014,"Heartwarming family movie that's very sweet and inspirational. If this movie doesn't make you smile, I feel sorry for you. Yes, it's predictable if you're an older viewer but that's not always a bad thing. It's based on a true story about this dolphin who loses her tail and the efforts to give her a prosthetic tail that might enable her to swim normally. They add some fictional elements to the movie for dramatic effect but nothing too corny. It's got a good cast and a good story with a lot of heart. The little girl Cozi Zuehlsdorff is especially adorable. It's a really nice movie with a hopeful message. It's a dolphin movie, people. Who doesn't like dolphins?",Dolphin Tale
5,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: Dolphin Tale,8,9 October 2011,"Top of my mind was how Winter the dolphin, which this film is inspired by and telling the story of its remarkable rehabilitation at the Clearwater Marine Aquarium, had to act as herself and go through what would be a traumatic incident involving a crab net being entangled around her body, which caused the lack of blood circulation at its tail and its eventual amputation. It's no fun for a human actor to go through that especially if to tell his own story involving the loss of a limb, and I suppose for an animal it's no fun as well. Which is why there's a growing concern about the welfare of dolphins that's gaining momentum post The Cove, and seriously with the animal's natural smile you may think that everything's A-OK.But I digress. If anything, Dolphin Tale serves up a counter point for aquariums to exist, if not for human intervention to rescue the dolphin when it was being beached, then to rehabilitate and the pooling of available resources to think out of the box and provide a solution to what would be life threatening since it involves the using of existing body structures to adapt for the absence of the crucial tail, but in doing so will result in permanent damage leading to death due to its unnatural movement. Enough scenes like these to tug at your heartstrings, especially since Winter the dolphin, like any other dolphin, comes across as intelligent, playful, and blessed with that adorable look that will delight any kid who's here to watch this film, which ironically will translate to increased demands for dolphin aquariums.Directed by Charles Martin Smith who has experience in directing another animal-kid buddy show in Air Bud, Dolphin Tale is extremely family friendly with its themes of courage and family ties, with nary a swear word uttered and plenty of feel good moments inserted. In some ways it is the true life story about Winter the Dolphin that inspires and gives strength to those who are at the crossroads of denial and acceptance, especially with a limb loss. To say it's not easy to cope is an understatement, but as far as rehabilitation goes, it's no wonder how the dolphin was able to show others that life still goes on, and allowed a little bit of advanced research to go into prosthetics making.As much as we learn from animals, they learn from us humans too, and for the fortunate few who could get into close proximity to rub off some of the positive aspects and optimism into life. It's a story here about the Haskett and the Nelson family, with each side facing a loss of a family member, and how through Winter they bond in most unexpected ways. Nathan Gamble plays Sawyer, an introverted boy who would grow to get out of his shell thanks to his finding of Winter and the zeal to want to make her better, now under the care of Dr Clay Haskett (Harry Connick Jr) and his young daughter Hazel (Cozi Zuehlsdorff). And the cast of Ashley Judd who plays Nathan's mom, Kris Kristofferson as Hazel's granddad, and Morgan Freeman as Dr Cameron McCarthy who got roped in by Sawyer to assist pro-bono in applying his expertise in prosthetics to design something for the dolphin, all add in the star factor of the film, although it is the kid actors who adequately carry the weight of this film on their shoulders.While the film doesn't throw up any surprises since the trailer would have shown the outcome, and if you were to do research you would chance upon the website of Winter the Dolphin and of Clearwater Marine Aquarium, it still worked plenty of wonders in knowing just where to reach out within you and amplify some heartwarming emotions. Stay tuned during the end credits to witness the actual video footage of the amazing rescue and rehabilitation of Winter.",Dolphin Tale
6,sddavis63,Decent Animal Story; Sort Of Flipper In Real Life,6,18 August 2012,"My suggestion if you're going to watch this is to think of Flipper in real life and fighting against much bigger odds. Really - there are a lot of similarities, especially the bond between Winter (the dolphin whose tail had to be amputated after being caught in a fishing line) and young Sawyer (Nathan Gamble) - a troubled kid involved in her rescue.As all animal stories tend to be, this one is heartwarming. After being taken to the Clearwater Marine Hospital, it's feared that Winter will die because without a tail she can't swim. But she teaches herself to swim like a fish (moving her backside side to side) only then to have it discovered that the motion itself will kill her by damaging her spine. The trick then is to develop a prosthesis to save her life.It's a good story, humorous at times, sad at times. Obviously it revolves around Winter's struggle to survive, but there's a lot of human drama going on in this as well, which perhaps gives it a bit of adult ""gravitas."" There are some fairly well known faces in this - Harry Connick, Jr. as the head of the Marine Hospital, Kris Kristofferson as his father and Morgan Freeman as the doctor who finally develops the prosthesis. It's better than ""Flipper"" mostly because it's based on a true story. It takes a few liberties but tells the basics pretty well. (6/10)",Dolphin Tale
7,MLDinTN,excellent uplifting story,10,30 June 2012,"I haven't given many of my reviews a 10, but this one I will because I loved this story. First, it's about one of the most incredible animals, a dolphin, and I love dolphins. They are so smart and friendly and this was a wonderful tale about a dolphin rescue. The dolphin, Winter, loses its tale after being rescued. The way she learns to swim is damaging her spine so they must come up with a prosthetic tale so that she uses the muscles in her spine correctly.The movie is also about Sawyer, a kid that helps with the rescue and needs something in his life to motivate him. Introduce Winter, and he sees helping her as something to look forward too. Sawyer and Hazel, a kid that works at the aquarium, make it their mission to help Winter. I also loved how Winter would just perk up when Sawyer was around, she would whistle and start eating.It was just a very touching movie, FINAL VERDICT: I highly recommend this.",Dolphin Tale
8,g-bodyl,"Sweet, Inspiring Family Film!",9,22 April 2013,"Dolphin Tale is another film about animals which has seem to be the craze these days but it is better than what I expected. It's sweet, charming, and emotional. I never thought I'd do this in a film like this, but there were moments when I choked up especially in the scenes involving the main character's injured cousin and the end credits. Apparently, the dolphin used in this film is actually the same dolphin whose true story this movie was inspired by.Charles Martin Smith's film is based on a true story about a dolphin who is rescued by a kid who always keep to himself. When the dolphin is transferred to an animal hospital, he and the owners who he became close with realize the dolphin may not live without his tail. They hire an orthopedist to set the dolphin right but will it work? Surprisingly, the acting is very good. I didn't expect much from the cast but Ashley Judd, Nathan Gamble, Harry Connick Jr, and of course Morgan Freeman all did a great job. I never thought a cast like this would be good but I was proved wrong.Overall, this is an inspirational story that will lift up the hearts of any animal-lover or any movie-lover for that matter. I didn't know at first if I could make it through the film but in the end, I never glanced at my watch. There should be more animal tales like this being made. In reality, people who do these kind things to animals proves there are still nice people in the world. I rate this film 9/10.",Dolphin Tale
9,lesleyharris30,"A Sweet, Heartwarming and Charming Family Film,",8,7 November 2015,"Dolphin Tale is a terrific movie with a very well developed storyline and a very impressive cast. It's a film that the entire family can enjoy, we all love sea creatures in general, so I believe it will touch your heart to see all these people coming together to save the life of one dolphin, the characters and the relationship that develops between them over the course of the movie is beautifully written and it's just as pleasing to know this is a true story. There was a lot of character arch that was very underused and that would be my only real issue with this film, there seemed to be a relationship developing between Harry Connick Jr. and Ashley Judd's character, and then they don't speak for the rest of the movie, plus we were given a little bit of information about both Sawyer's dad and Hazel's mom and we are expecting to learn more, but we never do, these are things they could have improved on to make the characters more three dimensional. The performances are simple, they're real, they seem comfortable in their roles and the chemistry between everyone is outstanding, they all feel like a family, even though they don't all play family members in the movie, there is a bond between them that we feel growing over the course of the movie, it makes what could have been another cheesy Free Willy-type film in to its own original movie that had me in tears with joy, it make you realise that there really are real heroes in the world, fighting for good and trying to make a change. A very sweet and emotional two hours, Dolphin Tale is a delightful movie for the whole family to enjoy. A group of animal lovers work together to save the life of a dolphin who has lost his tail.

10,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,19 December 2011,"Dolphin TaleThe only time dolphin tails make the news is when one ends up in a tuna sandwich.Fortunately, the detached appendage in this family movie steered clear of the deli counter.When a shy, young boy (Nathan Gamble) discovers an injured dolphin in a crab trap, he uses his genial nature to calm the beast and free it from its confines.The marred mammal is later taken to a refuge, where a doctor (Harry Connick Jr.) removes the damaged extremity.To get the despondent dolphin to eat after the surgery, the doctor coaxes the coy kid from the beach to help. Later, the same boy convinces the doctor to allow a prosthetics expert (Morgan Freeman) to construct an artificial tail.Utilizing science and compassion to overcome loss, this true story tugs the heartstrings while sating medical curiosity. Now, if only every amputee could be outfitted with a synthetic dolphin tale. (Yellow Light)vidiotreviews.blogspot.com",Dolphin Tale
11,digitalbeachbum,I support wildlife conservation but not this movie,1,8 March 2019,"I dislike over acting. I dislike scripts that are too wordy even more. This movie is nothing but that, over acting and too many words. Sure they did it for the kids, but this is ridiculously stupid. And BTW I have been to the CMA and donated to their cause.The script sucks. The casting is terrible. Direction terrible. The cinematographer is a genius because they make the CMA look really big. If you ever visit the place, you'll find that it is about the size of a 7-11. No, that's not true. It's actually the size of two 7-11s. No kidding. It's really, really small.I thought this would have been better if they would have had a better script. The script is the foundation of the whole production and with a weak foundation the entire movie crumbles.",Dolphin Tale
12,lisafordeay,Very good,8,28 July 2016,I owned the sequel to this so I picked up this film a week ago at a reasonable price. The original Dolphin Tale tells the tale of a young boy named Sawyer(played by Nathan Gamble)who comes across a pretty battered dolphin tangled up in a net as the dolphin's tail is damaged and he meets up with a Doctor named Dr Clay(played by former Jazz singer Harry Connick Jr)who looks after the dolphin at his aquarium and calls the dolphin Winter. Since Winter's tail is pretty bad they decided to amputate it and since Sawyer's cousin was injured in an accident Sawyer asks his cousin's prosthetic doctor(played by Morgan Freeman)to make a tail for Winter? But will it succeed?Overall I loved the film and the story is based on a true story. If you love animals particularity dolphins then check it out. Also stars Ashley Judd as Nathan Gamble's mother.,Dolphin Tale
13,juneebuggy,While not without clichés and redundant subplots still a pretty great family movie,8,18 October 2014,"This is a pretty great family movie about a young boy who befriends an injured dolphin after finding it caught in a crap trap. The dolphin ultimately loses its tail and the boy goes about convincing the locals at the marine hospital to help build it a prosthetic one.While Dolphin Tale is not without its moments of clichés and redundant subplots it's still beautifully filmed, inspiring and just one of those feel-good movies we all need from time to time. There's a great cast attached here with Harry Connick Jr & Ashley Judd, who supply enough romance and drama to keep the adults happy as well. I always enjoy Kris Kristofferson and Morgan Freeman plays a small role as well. 4/10/14",Dolphin Tale
14,davispittman,Ohhhh my gosh! Inconceivably boring!,1,9 April 2017,"This family oriented film starring Morgan Freeman, Ashley Judd, and Harry Connick Jr. is very tedious and BORINGGGG. Oh my goodness this movie had me close to full on napping. The pace is like a slow motion snail pace lol. I like the actors involved. Freeman, Judd, and Connick Jr. are all good actors and I admire their body of work, but this movie is so hopelessly dull that I just couldn't enjoy it for the life of me. The acting gets pretty cheesy at times and it almost seems like hallmark movie. I don't know I guess I wasn't the right kind of audience member for this film but I hated it from beginning to end. There was not a single time in the entire duration of the movie where I was honestly enjoying what I was watching. The script was too cheesy and hallmarky for me to take too seriously. The movie is very family friendly and it's suitable for family viewing but I would in no way shape or form recommend it for family or any viewing simply because of the incredible boredom I experienced while watching. There wasn't anything the filmmakers did to keep my attention at any point. 1/10 for Dolphin Tale. I have zero interest in seeing the sequel.",Dolphin Tale
15,3xHCCH,A positive message of hope and redemption in the face of adversity,7,28 October 2011,"This is a nice little inspirational movie that had a relentlessly positive message, and an exuberant talented cast (led by Morgan Freeman, Ashley Judd, and Harry Connick, Jr.) to boot. While the title and the poster already tells you what to expect, the movie actually had a multi- layered plot, all of these sub-stories drive home the same positive message of hope and redemption in the face of adversity.The main story of course is that of Winter, a young dolphin whose tail got caught and seriously injured in a crab trap. Sawyer, a young boy with school and father issues, grows very attached to this dolphin that he saved. When Winter's tail was eventually amputated, Sawyer sought the help of the prosthetics expert at the veteran's hospital to come up with a prosthetic tail so the dolphin could swim normally again.To thicken this simple and straightforward main plot, the script gave us several supporting stories. We get the story of Sawyer's older cousin Kyle, a swimmer who tragically lost his leg in the war. The very marine hospital itself where Winter was confined was in trouble with its sponsors and was threatened with closure. The very community of Clearwater, Florida where the story happened also had to face the wrath of a calamitous cyclone. We get to witness how these ""broken"" people had the will to rise above their difficulties and move on with their lives.There was of course no surprises anymore how this will end. However, the story telling was engaging without being too pushy or cheesy with its message. The kid actors were very natural and not annoying, especially the young man who played Sawyer, Nathan Gamble. I think it is a very good family film where important lessons about life can be learned by all. Once in a while it is quite refreshing to watch a happy positive film so reinforce the belief that not all hope is lost in this seemingly sad and cruel world of ours.",Dolphin Tale
16,jfgibson73,True Life Family Film,7,3 May 2021,"This is a nice family film. The details aren't exactly true to what happened to the real dolphin, but it will get kids interested. There is some overacting, but the story makes up for it. Well filmed.",Dolphin Tale
17,AudioFileZ,The Winter of Our Content!,9,16 December 2011,"The only way mankind can ever reach a level of contentment is when we humbly submit to our humanity. One certainly doesn't have to look far to see the polar opposite of that. Our world, as it is today, is rife with infirmity, suffering, war, and a general greediness that pulls mankind far away from what we can be. Sometimes we need a wake-up call, something to rally the good that is in us all. That is what ""Dolphin Tale"" excels at in my humble opinion. This piece of celluloid magically captures the true story of one of nature's most beautiful, loving, and social creatures that in its infirmity has brought out some of our best qualities as humans. That it is based on truth catapults it to being greater than entertainmentIt's truly inspirational.Winter, a dolphin, succumbs to injuries associated with a crab trap and is rescued. As Winter recuperates it becomes necessary for a large portion of her tail, as well as several of her vertebrae, to be removed. In the movie she is found by a young boy who has retreated from much of the world around him after his father abandoned his mother and him. Winter's struggle to live becomes the boy's bridge to his own healing. As Winter heals at the Clearwater Rescue Hospital and Aquarium it becomes apparent the financial state of the hospital is in worse shape than she is. The land the aquarium sits on is of such value that the only way a mountain of red ink can be erased is by relocating all of the animals and selling out. Greed wasn't even good on Wall Street (I think we universally agree on this), and when it comes to humanitarian causes its worse! It looks as if an infirm dolphin who no other aquarium will take is down for the count. Then something I liken to God's hand intervenes. Winter's story hits the internet and the news media sparking what can only be called the best in humanity. Not only that, but for scores of people, particularly children, who suffer from devastating physical injuries Winter becomes an inspiration to overcome their infirmities. I can't help but feel reasons such as this is why we are here and when we rise to the occasion of loving and caring for one another then the ugly stuff can't get a foothold.I'm 52 years old, far from being a youngster, and I say this movie is great. It celebrates what we can do when we are humble, putting even poor creatures above our own needs. Charles Martin Smith has created one of the purest family movies that both entertains and sends a message I have ever seen. I applaud his screen writing, direction, and braveness in bringing together a good cast to tell this uplifting story.",Dolphin Tale

19,p-stepien,Not just the dolphins...,7,28 September 2012,"Lonely and lacking a social crowd to hand out with Sawyer Nelson (Nathan Gamble) wanders aimlessly across the beaches. Per chance he comes across an injured and web-entangled dolphin, who with the help of an animal hospital is saved, but only after necessitating a tail fin amputation. Falling in love with the new ocean friend named Winter he quickly becomes part of the facility, where he is taken care of. Nonetheless without a tail fin Winter is bound to die, despite the crews best intention...Based on the true life animal ""The Dolpin Tale"" delivers a heart-warming and educational story about a victory of life and humanity (or maybe 'animality' given the strong input by Winter himself). Featuring a stellar cast of Ashley Judd, Kris Kristofferson and Morgan Freeman, each suitably fitting their given roles, comes a surprisingly brisk and informative family flick, albeit not devoid of overly sugar-coated endings and several corny scenes. Nonetheless even those are unable to derail an otherwise endearing feature, above all thanks to the wider message of tolerance and acceptance, which helps teach lessons to the children of today. Such an inspirational story, far from any artistic credibility, is above all a very welcome type of fare for the overemphasis of fast and furious nowadays even directed to our youth.",Dolphin Tale
20,bob-rutzel-1,Good Family Movie,7,16 January 2012,"This movie was inspired by the true story of Winter.Sawyer (Gamble) helps a wounded dolphin (Winter) on the beach. A call to 911 puts Winter at the Clearwater Marine Hospital. Sawyer keeps checking on Winter as they share a bond. So there I was rushing to see another Ashley Judd movie (hold on Bob, this was not an Ashley Judd movie) Yeah, I found out. She had a small role as Lorraine, Sawyer's mother, and did good. And, with a possible romantic angle with Dr. Clay Haskett (Connick, Jr),in charge of the hospital, you would expect a romantic thing between them. But, this is a kids' story (Winter's too) and the two young actors Nathan Gamble and Cozi Zuehisdorff as Hazel carried this movie all the way to the end. Very good. Most of the movie centered on fixing Winter who severely injured her tail in a fisherman's cage and netting. The tail needed fixing as Winter needed to swim with the tail going up and down, and not sideways. If the tail was not fixed, Winter would die in time. Dr. McCarthy (Freeman) is brought in to see if he could help with some kind of prosthetic to help Winter swim properly. And, with that voice you just believe things will be all right in time. Morgan Freeman has that affect. Rufus, a pesky pelican, makes some unexpected appearances and acts like comic relief quite often. A very nice movie the whole family can enjoy, but bring a box of Kleenex with you anyway. You might need it in places.

The tale of Winter, the dolphin, and her struggle is told with heart and, this is one the whole family can watch and should be encouraged to watch.With a great cast, a good script, and nice filming this is a well-made production that not only hits the right note but does so in a way that genuinely moved us - I know this worked as the kids were transfixed the whole time.Just wish they were a ton more family films like this out there - no guns, or action, no CGI, but rather just a great watch.",Dolphin Tale
22,krocheav,Winter Steals The Show,8,15 December 2016,"What a surprise this turned out to be. Being based on a factual event makes it even more appealing - it's also perhaps the first tale about a prosthetic fitted real-life Dolphin!. Adding to the fascination is the fact Winter the Dolphin actually plays herself - quite a feat (err tale). Multi-skilled director Charles Martin Smith mostly keeps the pace and the story on track. OK, I found a couple of small scenes unnecessary (maybe only for the 3D effects - or perhaps a bit coy?) and young Cozi Zuehisdorff's character may have been a tiny bit over the top but, young Nathan Gamble (The Dark Knight '08) is a natural. He shines in all his scenes and his character has some heavy 'things' to deal with.German cinematographer Karl Walter Lindenlaub (Rob Roy '95) gives us glowing images and Mark Isham provides the interesting music score. An ideal family film that tackles many important real life issues. It not only supplies employment to a variety of interesting and carefully picked mainstream cast members but gives them some decent characters to bring to life. Very good of its genre.",Dolphin Tale
23,SusieSalmonLikeTheFish,Kind of corny but okay for kids,6,25 September 2014,"I'm sure you've heard of Flipper, Beethoven, Homeward Bound, Shiloh, etc. These types of films are rarely very good, and are often the story of a lonely child (multiple children on occasion) who find an animal they have adventures with. These films are popular with the ""my dog is my fur-child"" nonsense people, and with little kids. Dolphin Tale isn't much different, but it strays from the norm enough to excite kids.Sawyer is an 11-year-old boy who is lonely and sad that his beloved cousin Kyle is enrolling in the military. One day he meets a concerned fisherman who has found a bottlenose dolphin with an injured tail (caught in a crab trap), and the two call a rescue team and although Sawyer continues skipping classes to visit the dolphin, his mother notices his bad moods improving and permits him to continue visiting ""Winter"". Winter's tail has to be amputated but a prosthetic tail is built so Winter can properly swim. Sawyer also takes up volunteering at the local hospital. Meanwhile Kyle becomes depressed, and during a hurricane Winter may have to be euthanized. Can Sawyer save the dolphin from this fate? Dolphin Tale had some of those ""so-fake-sweet-I'm-gonna-puke"" moments, along with incredibly dorky moments, but it can hold an audience with its strange originality. The soundtrack wasn't very good but the acting was half-decent and the bottlenose dolphin was pretty cute. What some people may find interesting is that it was based on a true story. It also came out the same year as Soul Surfer, a film about a teenage girl who loses her arm to a shark attack. Most adults wouldn't be able to take this film seriously because it's so cheesy at times, but for kids and animal-lovers it could have quite a large audience.",Dolphin Tale
24,blott2319-1,Totally by-the-numbers family drama,6,11 May 2020,"Dolphin Tale is about as obvious and by-the-numbers as you could possibly imagine from any inspirational animal film. If you saw a trailer, read the synopsis, or even made a rough guess based on the title, I'm betting you could come pretty close to guessing what this movie delivers. It's the kind of script that I could see a screenwriter inventing even if an actual tail-less dolphin didn't exist as the basis for their story. The most interesting element of Dolphin Tale is definitely the fact that Winter is a real dolphin and has actually dealt with the problems dramatized in this movie. Of course, the movie wants to focus on a character who can talk, so instead the plot is more about a young boy who wants to help save this injured dolphin. It's the ""Free Willy"" formula, and apparently it works for most people because this was a box office success. But the sad truth is that basically every detail of this film is a fabrication used to make a Hollywood story out of a unique animal that could be inspiring on her own.Once I forced myself to ignore the discrepancy between reality and Dolphin Tale, I was able to get some enjoyment from it. It's hard not to be affected by the tug on your heartstrings when a movie is about a struggling boy who finally finds passion in his life. And, of course, that impact is increased by the fact that a crippled dolphin is part of that story. While most of this movie was overflowing with cliché, I did appreciate that it avoided going straight down every obvious pathway. There was one particular event that I expected from early on in the film, and I was surprised the movie never went there. Probably the most annoying aspect of Dolphin Tale is the trope of the aquarium running low on funds and needing to find a way to stay open. It was one additional layer of conflict that the movie didn't require. I can appreciate Dolphin Tale for what it is, and could even recommend it for family entertainment, but I also wish I could just watch a documentary about how Winter was truly saved.",Dolphin Tale

However this truly was the perfect family film and had everything required to keep those of all ages involved.

Kids-bonding-with-cute-animals movies are as old as time immemorial, and commonly stick to a rigid formula... and this entry is no exception. Let me outline the central conflicts, to give you a general idea:1. A loner schoolboy, who's only friend seems to be his champion swimmer cousin, finds an injured dolphin on the coast. Will he befriend it, swim with it at his local aquarium, help it's rehabilitation and in turn, overcome his natural shyness?2. The kid is at summer school. Will his mother, after an impromptu visit to the sea life centre, agree to withdraw him from all his classes so he can play with the fishes all season long? 3. Oh I forget to mention earlier... the cousin is also a soldier, and is partially paralysed while on duty. Will the script draw parallels between his injury and subsequent depression, and that of the dolphin losing it's tail fin and refusing to eat? 4. The cousin's physio is played by none other than Morgan Freeman (You know, that guy from the insurance ads). Do you reckon, that he'll be able to help the cousin get over his funk with an 'Inspiring Speech' (One of MANY in the film)?5. That Morgan Freeman is a talented guy... he can also design prosthetics. But... can he do one for a dolphin to help it swim, and will there be many failures before he FINALLY get it right near the end (Thanks to the kid noticing a flaw in his plans, of course)? 6. The aquarium is in danger of closing due to lack of funds, a problem which is exacerbated by a random storm which destroys half the building. Will they be able to raise the cash by exploiting the dolphins disability to hold a big Open Day, or are they going to have to sell their assets to the sushi and tuna factories? If you answered NO to any of these, then you're a big dummy... so leave the room. Everything you could want from an uncomplicated heartwarmer is here, including a orchestral soundtrack which swells whenever something 'touching' happens, and a full ending montage of the schoolboy getting rather, um... 'close and personal' with the dolphin. So... it's an efficient piece of manipulative drama, with the added bonus of no swearing or toilet jokes. But not for me. Thank you, and goodnight. 5/10",Dolphin Tale

29,talisencrw,Decent family film for non-cinematic reasons--I would have preferred the documentary instead!,7,16 September 2016,"This was a decent watch, not for cinematic reasons per se but for making the world a better place. I watched this with my son, Julian, and I was pleased with how they took the true story, including the actual dolphin from it, and, especially for kids, promoted environmentalism, caring for animals, etc.--really solid and important aspects that need to be, more than ever, emphasized in the youth of today.My only qualms is that I have very mixed emotions about the casting. I know that to get an important environmental message heard, and thus the film watched, you have to incorporate Hollywood megastars. I simply wish this didn't have to be the case. The story would have come across better with unknown actors--or simply as a sincere documentary without the Hollywood B.S.",Dolphin Tale
30,drpakmanrains,Unusually Fine Family Friendly Film,10,15 February 2013,"Not since ""The Blind Side"" have I seen a film suitable and interesting for all ages that was as good as ""Dolphin Tale"". From the moment Nathan Gamble discovers ""Winter"" on the beach, I found myself tearing up on and off. This is the kind of general audience movie that deals with serious issues in an entertaining fashion. All the performances are at least adequate, and many are excellent, especially the two kids. There are some moments that pander to those looking for cuteness, such as the repeated shenanigans of the pelican, ""Roofus"", or the out of control toy helicopter, but most of the film deals with the story itself, and I, at 72, truly enjoyed it thoroughly. When I read some of the negative reviews here, I felt sorry for those who so lack empathy that anything which is very sentimental is automatically discarded as corny or tearjerking. Well, in 1953, when I first saw ""Shane"", I realized how a film could move me powerfully to the point of tears at age 12. And from then to today, my favorite films are almost always those that can truly move me and are not afraid to be unabashedly sentimental. Dolphin Tale is definitely in that category.If your idea of a great movie is ""Ted"", or ""Stepbrothers"", or ""The Fast and the Furious"", stay away.",Dolphin Tale
31,omkar1984,Loveable!!!,8,11 April 2019,"A tale of compassion and perseverance. One of the movies that has happy endings but doesn't compromise much on the facts. Nathan Gamble as Sawyer deserves a pat on the back for his depiction of a, first reclusive and depressed lad, later a changed boy fighting for a cause, energetically ! Sawyer bringing his toys and Winter enjoying those steals heart and the movie has aplenty such scenes. A bubbly Hazel, her emotional father Clay, the supportive and encouraging grandpa, the optimistic and humorous Dr. McCarthy - all make a mark ! The mischievous pelican, too, can't be forgotten. Winter is , well, ADORABLE(only word I can think of). The hope the challenged kids get from Winter is touching. Such movies do depress me in another way - why isn't the world always as good as it's shown in the movie, a heartthrob.",Dolphin Tale
32,TroyeEvans,"Brief Review on ""Dolphin Tale""",5,14 October 2011,"""Dolphin Tale"" is definitely a good movie for the whole family. Both children and adults will enjoy this. It may not have much depth but it is the sort of movie that can entertain people at all ages. The story is linear and simple. Basically it is about a boy who develops a bond with a dolphin named Winter and is dedicated to helping the dolphin with a lost tail to swim again. The story does build on simplicity but it still manages to be touching at certain moments. The story develops at a moderate pace. There are some underwater scenes in the film and the effects are nicely done. This film also does not disappoint people who have paid for 3D tickets.All in all, ""Dolphin Tale"" is a good family film for the weekend.",Dolphin Tale
33,MosHr,Simple story told with great skill,9,20 September 2011,"From what I've seen, the trailer on TV and previews have everyone expecting a sappy and cloying family drama; all the elements for it are there - war tragedy, absent parents, incredibly cute animals, confused adults, children - but somehow it manages to transcend the trappings of the family drama genre. There is absolutely nothing more to the story than what's on the trailer but nevertheless, the way it gets to the inevitable points in the story are done with great skill and nuance. The performances coaxed out of all the actors are great, even the dolphin Winter and the pelican.""Dolphin Tale"" aims to tell a very simple story and never over-complicates it. The movie aims to offer an atmosphere and glimpses of lives rather than something story driven. Though the movie boasts of big names, they are never above or beyond the story and all are pieces of the story rather than big actors. The movie does veer a bit into the boy and his beloved pet territory that might get parent cringing that their kids are going to want dolphins for Christmas or dolphin rides or whatever the amusement park version of it is. But, as a whole the movie does manage to be about the dolphin Winter as the title promises and not overly about the characters.For a movie to take your kids too and for you to enjoy as well, I highly recommend the movie.",Dolphin Tale
34,sagei,Imperfect.,10,2 January 2012,"Uneven pacing. Comic relief that often falls flat. Yada, yada...The movie is far from perfect, just like the dolphin. Yet just like the dolphin it still works. Really well. The cast and crew have put their hearts into it and it shows. The music, camera-work etc were all good.But there is only one star and that is Winter.Beautiful, intelligent and inspirational.A heroine you can fall in love with.Go see her.Her magic will enrich your life, even if it be for just a moment.Wish them well.Thank you.",Dolphin Tale
35,facebook-124-955845,An Inspiration to us all,10,10 September 2011,"Inspirational films are often difficult to review. The movie is inspirational for a reason; therefore, it's usually telling a story of someone making the best out of a bad situation. The problem is that no one wants to be the person to say the movie isn't worth watching. Thankfully, Dolphin Tale isn't one of those movies. Dolphin Tale tells the true story of Winter, a dolphin who due to a very unfortunate accident loses her tail and the group of people who help her to survive despite her handicap. Director Charles Martin Smith, best known for his roles in The Untouchables and Never Cry Wolf, takes a heartfelt story and presents it just as is. The movie's lead is a young actor named Nathan Gamble, who plays Sawyer Nelson. . Gamble is surrounded by high level talent, which you usually don't find in movies of this type; Ashley Judd, plays Lorraine Nelson, Sawyer's mom; Morgan Freeman, working alongside of Judd for the third time, plays Dr. McCarthy, a VA doctor tasked with trying to create a working prosthetic to replace Winter's tail; and Harry Connick Jr. is doctor Clay Haskett, who runs the Clearwater Marine Aquarium and along with his team is mostly responsible for saving Winter's life. Judd provides an endearing charm as Lorraine, and her enthusiasm shines through. There couldn't have been anyone better to play Dr. McCarthy than the great Morgan Freeman. Freeman gives credence to Dr. McCarthy and, thanks to him not being in the right frame of mind, his dedication to creating a new tail for Winter. The charismatic Harry Connick Jr. gives a stellar performance, providing Sawyer with a role model. Cozi Zuehlsdorf makes her acting debut as Hazel Haskett, Sawyer's best friend. Along with Sawyer, the two of them work together to make some magical happen. Zuehlsdorf's shining personality and adorable smile, along with her chattiness, reminded me of what makes my own daughter so special. Not to be overlooked or forgotten, Winter the Dolphin plays herself and is a wonder to watch. Dolphin Tale teaches and inspires in so many ways. It teaches us to not judge anyone that may be different; it teaches us that family is forever; it inspires us to be role models; it inspires single parents to keep up the great work; and most importantly it inspires those that have set back to never give up. Winter's story is an incredible miracle. As I sat between my son, who's almost 8, and my daughter who is 5, I couldn't help but well up with tears at the determination of these extraordinary people as they all went above and beyond in the hopes of saving a fish; yes, I know that dolphins are mammals and are not really fish. At the end of the movie, I asked my kids how they liked it and they both said that they loved it. They then asked me how I liked it, and my response to them was ""I think that may have been my favorite movie so far this summer."" I no longer have to think about it, it IS my favorite movie so far this year.Grade: A+Be sure to check out Winter at www.seewinter.com; and then check out our website at www.twodudereview.com",Dolphin Tale
36,Andreapworth,Loved it,9,25 October 2012,"I had NO IDEA what to expect, other than it was about a hurt dolphin. As I am nuts about dolphins, I had hopes that it would be good. But I was GREAT. I had tears in my eyes at the end. The cast was all solid and good. And you couldn't see what solution they would find for the financial difficulties and when they did find a solution, you will be so happy and relieved.And maybe, like me, you will want to shout at the screen that dolphins aren't animals, but of the fish/aquatic family. OK, they have to breathe air. Does that make them animals? I don't think so. Whales also have to surface for air, but nobody calls THEM animals.Lovely, wonderful movie with an excellent cast. If you are like me, and grew up with Flipper, etc., you will enjoy it tremendously.",Dolphin Tale
37,ryokan_wc,Inspirational is the word,9,15 July 2012,"If there is one word to describe this movie, it's inspirational! The characters display great emotional depth with well developed story line. The link between Winter, the real life dolphin who suffers a damage and eventually removes the tail, and Sawyer's cousin, Kyle, who is injured during his time in the marines, is touching and uplifting simultaneously. The bond shared by Winter and Sawyer (who is, at the beginning of the movie, a reserved and almost friendless boy) is what every kid would want; the close bonding between Sawyer and Kyle shows that 'Family is Forever', and the friendship developed by Sawyer and Hazel is one to adore.Struggling to keep up with the financial of the aquarium, at the same time helping Winter to swim normally again, sold this movie like none other, apart from the nicely done effects. Scenes that leave lasting impacts include when another handicapped child travels for hours just to visit Winter (how Winter inspires the many lives of human beings), and Sawyer and later Dr McCarthy's comments on Kyle's selfishness. Of course, great job to the cast for delivering an honest, believable and true performance. If the entire length of the movie is heart-warming enough, wait until the video clips of Winter at the end of the show- you will smile because you cannot cry.I may be biased in this review, in such that i am passionate about the marine life- definitely, to swim with the dolphin, or Winter herself, is a reward. But putting that aside, this movie is one to watch, worth watching and worth remembering. I believe the rich values of this movie will propagate with great length- never give up! I felt uplifted after the movie, and i'm sure you will too.",Dolphin Tale
38,doctorjagger,Best Movie of 2011,10,25 September 2011,"This was the best movie of 2011. It is dramatic, comedic, fun, emotional all at the same time, and does it all very well. It is very family friendly, appeals to kids very easily, also it appeals to adults very easily. It also has a strong pull for veterans and disabled people. People can relate to a dolphin with a prosthetic tale and the main character's cousin who comes home from war with a disability. The acting is top notch. I have to say the young lead, Nathan Gamble, really stuck out as the best of the bunch. He acted every scene and every line, and every expression to the 't'. He has a bright future as an actor and will have no problem become as well known as star as his co-stars are now. Morgan Freeman was his usual fun and endearing self with a whimsical twist. Ashley Judd was very good as usual. The other young co-star, Cozi Zuelsdorf, made a very good start with her debut role, and should succeed should she choose to go on acting. Harry Connick Jr. was a fun character and made his usual top notch performance, he even got to flex his musician muscles for a scene. Winter the Dolphin who plays herself will even captivate your attention with her own unique personality. This movie is a hear-felt, fun, dramatic and inspiring movie. People may compare it to other aquatic-themed movies, but once they've seen it, they will agree it stands apart as unique and wonderful. I would give this movie a 20 out of 10 but this site won't let me. So 10/10 all around, especially for young Nathan Gamble!",Dolphin Tale
39,katy-247-158113,Exactly as advertised,5,18 January 2012,"Just watching the advertisements on television about the movie pretty much sums it all up. It is more of a goodie goodie movie suited for teens, kids and animal lovers. Sure it was OK but that is as far as it goes. After all I knew in advance that it was a movie about a dolphins tail and to be honest with you, so what a dolphin got a fake tail. Low interest for me. I do like family movies probably more than any other type, but I need a better subject matter than a dolphin getting a tail and an odd kid coming out of his shell because of it. The acting was certainly alright, but the subject matter needed help in my opinion. I watched it because I thought others may like it. We all drew the same conclusion, it was OK.",Dolphin Tale
40,debruin1975,Putting the D back into dolphins...,10,22 January 2012,"OMG... this movie is just super excellent and so beautiful, I can't hardly describe the feeling. For what comes to animal movies, this must be the cherry on the cake. But let's start at the beginning. I was browsing thru my movie collection and I heard about this movie, Dolphin Tale. I thought that it was just like Free Willy... boy, was I wrong. No soggy stories here, only uplifting stuff. OK, there are bad parts in the movie, like in the beginning when poor Winter is stranded. You can actually feel her pain burning off the screen. You KNOW she's in danger and that she NEEDS help. Later on, they amputate the tail off the dolphin (you don't get to see how it's done luckily) but then instead of downhill, it's going uphill with this movie. I will spoil no more.Dolphinlovers, animal-lovers: this is your kind of movie right here, and even I enjoyed every second of it. Dang, Hollywood: make more movies like this!! please!! On the other hand, Hollywood knowing, there will be a part 2 -- let's all hope that this is not going to happen!!!!",Dolphin Tale

I am just impressed that I actually enjoyed the movie, it's rare of me to enjoy a family/kids movie, it's a feel good movie and it brought up many emotions within me. I'm writing this on Christmas day, and have already recommended this to the family, as I think it is the perfect Christmas movie, a very inspirational movie.

42,tubeindustriesbroadcastingco,"Bland, uninspired, bland, sappy, and bland",2,18 December 2016,"If you like feel good that have cute animals and adorable moments, this one is for you.HOWEVER, if you want to see a movie with a well built up plot and real tension and passion, this is not for you.There is one word that comes to my mind when I think of this movie: Bland.It just screams it, our story starts off in some suburb in Florida presumably, where are main character (whos name I cannot seem to recall, probably something generic like Chris) is fiddling with junk in his garage while everyone outside is throwing some going away party for his older brother who is going off to fight in the United States Armed Forces in some unfortunate Mid-East conflict. Apparently our main character is sad because he has to go to summer school for some reason. His brother says some cliché inspirational words and then is off to honorably serve his country. Anyways, he is off to summer school or whatever when he is riding next to the beach where he sees a dolphin in distress, an old man helps him contact animal rescue services where they save the dolphin and bring it to the Generic Aquatic Animal Facility that's name isn't important enough to remember. Our character is curious and skips school to see the dolphin the dolphin he shouldn't really have an emotional connection to but does for plot reasons.The boy actually BREAKS INTO the Aquatic Animal Rescue Whatever Facility to see the Dolphin only to advance the plot. Why would a minor break into an Aquarium I know not. He then meets a geeky marine animal loving girl who doesn't immediately report the intruder for some reason and lets him see the rescued dolphin. They then get caught by the dad uncle what ever figure who is OK that a minor broke into his Aquarium. Blah Blah Blah the boy has more of an emotional connection to the Dolphin blah blah. Apparently the dolphins name is ""Winter"" or something that will make you ""AWWWWW That's SO CUTE"" like the movie tries to do the entire time but Winter has a terrible tail injury and it needs to be amputated because reasons.Meanwhile our main characters brother has had a terribly injury with a munitions bunker or something and has paralysis in his legs. This is the part of the movie that's supposed to be emotional because the Brothers injury represents the Dolphins injury or something that barley has a remote connection until THE ENDING CREDITS but whatever. Apparently our main Characters Brother is ashamed of himself because joining the military was the only way his family could pay for the main characters supposed Olympic swimming future or something. The rest of the movie has Morgan Freeman and our main character trying to make a prosthetic tail for Winter and more fabricated drama and a vomit worthy overly sappy music number.Also a few scenes in the movie are about when the Mother finally discovers that her son has been skipping summer school to see the Dolphin. This is where it gets stupid. The bratty main character whines and cries about how she will never understand the """"MAGIC"""" of Winter and the Mom changes her mind because her kid cried a little and then goes to the summer school teacher and says that her son is having a more """"enriching"""" experience with a dolphin that he is at school learning about Mathematics, History, and Science that isn't marine biology. The teacher is consumed by the sappy narrative and caves in and lets our Character go to the Aquarium INSTEAD OF going to summer school which was probably a district order but whatever, when you have an overly emotional dolphin movie why need reality right? The Dolphin doesn't wear the tale properly and throws it off. This causes the Generic Marine Aquatic Life Rescue Center and Aquarium Learning Marine School or whatever the heck its called to predict Winter will die. Then they make a new prosthetic tale that the Dolphin learns to swim with and doesn't have to die.But oh no, the Aquatic Marine Life Rescue Learning Center Extravaganza Animal Hospital is having Financial issues but Winter is so adorable people everywhere want to see it and the admission revenue saves the Facility.In the end, the Dolphin lives, the kid gets to skip school, and the Magic Animal Hospital And Aquatic Display Learning Aquarium Facility doesn't go out of business.YAY.The only memorable part of the movie is AT THE VERY END which shows WHAT REALLY HAPPENED, its a lot less dramatic I can assure you. It shows how people with prosthetics relate to the animal in a therapeutic relation sort of way which relates to the munition incident back in the film.Honestly, this film was made about a little known Dolphin that receives a prosthetic tale. I am pretty sure the thing about the kids relationship with the Dolphin is completely fabricated sappy garbage made to make a quick buck off unsuspecting parents and pre-teens.",Dolphin Tale
43,Apollocandybar,"Uplifting movie, but not the best execution",7,29 December 2011,"Our family (mom, dad, 8 year old, 5 year old, 4 year old) saw this movie in a theater. We homeschool our children, and had heard it had a pro- homeschooling message. Also our kids loved Soul Surfer earlier in the year, and this seemed like it'd be similar to that.Overall, it was a cute movie and good uplifting message. There is definitely a pro-homeschooling message. The boy is failing in traditional public school, and the lessons the summer school teacher is giving him are obviously pointless and not applicable to anything he might do in real life. The dolphin doctor's daughter is homeschooled and seems to be a happy, well-adjusted child. In general however, the movie is slow and boring. There are only a few exciting parts, and otherwise it drags. Even the scenes with Morgan Freeman were lackluster. And Harry Connick Jr should really stick to singing or Will & Grace. His acting is flat and his character was not at all believable.I would rate it less than 7/10 if not for the fact that we need more uplifting, wholesome movies like this! The execution just fell short in this case, but the story and the way it was put together to be appealing to both adults and children, was a great idea. I also appreciated that the adults were not made to be villains, as is often the case in movies where children are the main protagonists.",Dolphin Tale

However, this movie was superb. Winter being hurt was not overly graphic and the scene was relatively short. This movie is a powerful reminder that, even though the world is very messed up, there is great reason for hope. There is still goodness in the world, and people that will stand up for what's right. The staff of the rescue facility only saw Winter, and only wanted to help her, but she has been an inspiration to thousands, if not millions.

But then again, this is not ""just a movie"", it is a film based on real story and it resembles it pretty close. The dolphin in this film is not just some kind of ""actor dolphin"" combined with computer animated graphics in order to cover the tail...no, this dolphin is the real Winter who actually had this accident. I was blown away by this film. When watching this with the right frame of mind, it can have such a deep, profound and touching influence,it is simply amazing. This film really warms your heart and can give so much positivity. When I found out that this is actually based on a real story I was blown away and I came to this conclusion: As long as these things are happening on our planet we still have hope. For some moments, I thought I could sense the awareness and gratefulness in the dolphin's eyes...seconds later I was thinking my emotions are just driving me mad.However, this is a magnificent story, and the real beauty of this is: It's a real story.

I think it is as close to a true story as you can get in Hollywood and it's these little stories that children look to for inspiration to do good -which we so desperately need more of as a positive influence on their lives! This was done on a very tight budget with very big star power. This will help the aquarium grow by visitors of the movie also visiting Winter the dolphin in real life.

49,edac681,"Emotional, entertaining, and captivating!",10,13 September 2011,"The story of Dolphin Tale is very inspirational and uplifting. It teaches us not to give up when all seems hopeless. Winter lost her tail and the aquarium was poised to close down due to financial issues. After the aquarium exhausted all possible options, they had to sell the aquarium, but no other centres are willing to accept Winter. The last option they have was to put her down peacefully. Despite the hopelessness, young Sawyer Nelson (played by Nathan Gamble) refuses to give up. After witnessing a mother and her little girl who has only one leg were willing to drive hours up from out of town just to see Winter, Sawyer came up with a brilliant plan that can save this handicapped dolphin. Although Sawyer failed many of his school subjects, he is indeed brilliant. His mom was surprised by his knowledge, commitment and intelligence, brought forth by what he was interested in.There are many lessons that we can take from Dolphin Tale. One of the many lessons is that children who may not seem bright at first, just needs to find a subject of interest to them in order to display their intelligence. Moreover, miracles do happen, but sometimes we need to persevere long enough and never give up before we are able to see it happen. Dolphin Tale teaches us that there is hope even when all seems hopeless.Dolphin Tale neither has a typical villain nor a big climax. It is simply an inspirational movie that I find to be emotional, entertaining and captivating. It is children friendly and excellent for the whole family to watch. I was astounded by this movie and I highly encourage everyone to watch it. The actors and actresses truly deliver. Moreover, I am once again dazzled by Gamble's acting as he brilliantly portrays the character of Sawyer Nelson. I look forward to his future projects and I believe he will continue to rise in the film industry.",Dolphin Tale
50,tunnercarjake,Go get a Pixar film instead.,3,27 April 2012,"BOTTOM LINE: With Pixar cranking out regular magic with charm and beautifully crafted stories, this kind of crappy family movie should be put to death immediately. This movie was poor. It was low, and stank of hidden messages and tired cliché. If you look at the cover, you will know exactly what you are getting. Its that old annoying preachy movie, and it spews out world issues so fast and frequent that the plot devolves to laughable. The acting is inconstant, and sometimes so lifeless and poor that the entire scene will be sabotaged, though I don't think that even a De Niro in his prime could have saved the terrible writing. The effects for the dolphins are usually terrible when not the real dolphin, as they look like a video game from about eight years ago. The plot is paper thin, full of holes and problems.Expect to see the loner kid, who tinkers with toys in his basement, dreaming of fitting in, and who's parents have split. His cousin (I think) is sent to Iraq, he saves a dolphin, and yells at ""evil"" fishermen. Half the time you expect him to run away and join a mischievous band of thieves in London, or some other tired cliché. This is the kind of movie that makes me sick. Made to wring out even more money on the ""Free Willy"" concept, built for shoving more messages in your face.",Dolphin Tale
51,iankodai,You've got to be kidding me...,5,20 July 2015,"SPOILER WARNING:I had to stop watching this Lifetime level trash when I saw how PAINFULLY slow the dolphin's actual rescue was. It was literally laughable! Had I been freaking 8 years old I could and WOULD have had that dolphin free in a matter of a minute or less. The fact that the kid was AFRAID of a dolphin is ridiculous. The movie sets it up like you should fear them at first or something, not to mention the douche old man fisher who tells the kid to get away from it like he knows what he is doing. Kids, if you are reading this, anytime you see an animal in distress you help it, unless it's a predator, then do your best to help it safely or call animal control, police, or coast guard ASAP. Don't listen to dumb old people who simply want to control outcomes of all situations because they think they ""know"" better. The stupid timid act makes me sick. The kid lives his entire life in slow motion. T,t,today junior! It's pathetic attempt at the overused Hollywood trope of awkward teen who has zero social senses finds animal who opens him up to the world. Cute, but so predictable and OVER-ACTED! I'm literally a teacher of young kids and in all my years, I've never seen a kid that reserved or timid or slow to act or answer a question. I've seen many simply refuse, but none take that long. It's all for show people. Is there a heartwarming tale woven through all this crap? Of course, but if that kid really wanted to make a difference he would have ran over to that dolphin and cut it loose WITHOUT hesitation and complete disregard for the idiot fisherman. The story, although based on a true story, is not believable at all.",Dolphin Tale
52,JS57Bar,A lovely wholesome family film...,8,27 April 2019,"This is a sweet film, enjoyable for the whole family! Nicely done film. Well worth the watch!My review was short and sweet above but after seeing some negative comments/reviews I wanted to add this... is it sappy? Yes!... is the acting a tad not super great? Yes! Is it a Hallmark type movie? Yes!
But at the end of the day this film is a nice feel good time based especially due to the fact it's based on a true story. So if your family, young and old enjoy these types of movies then watch it and enjoy! God only knows we need positive vibes in the times we live in nowadays.",Dolphin Tale
53,polrky76,Excellent movie!,10,24 September 2011,"I highly recommend this movie. Such a feel good movie and I love that it's a true story. Winter totally won over my heart. Such a sweet dolphin! I just can't get over how much I loved this movie! My 7 year old also loved it. This movie showed an amazing story of triumph and not giving up. Really relates to those with handicaps. Winter has an amazing, thriving nature to her and shows us how to be compassionate, loving, and caring. I cried tears of joy seeing her overcome her disability and showing others that it can be done. This movie was very well made and focused on her rehab instead of her injury. If you have a love for dolphins this is a must see!",Dolphin Tale
54,smcgough1019,Great for the family,10,31 August 2011,"This movie is a fun, feel good movie the whole family can enjoy. Don't let the PG rating scare off the little ones. The only reason I can figure they gave it a PG rating is because of the talk of prosthetics and because Winter loses her tail. It is based on the story of Winter the dolphin. A lot of it is true although they have ""hollywooded"" it up. I saw it in 3D. I think the cinematography was beautiful. The colors were very vibrant. Winter is an inspiration to us all. She shows kids that anyone can overcome obstacles.",Dolphin Tale
55,woodysmcshop,what a great movie in all,10,6 October 2011,well from clearwater Florida myself where this is filmed its great to see all locations and be like oh there's honeymoon island there's the tarpon sponge docks there's clearwater beach and oh there's where i work the sandpearl resort where many of the crew and actors stayed. as a cook for the sandpearl i got to meet many of the actors. but the clearwater marine aquarium has always been a place dear to my heart it has such a great cause and is so heavily underfunded. this movie is so inspiring too. i took my girlfriend there who suffers from CP (cerebal palsy) and it brings tears in my eyes to show the will power of a dolphin to survive just like a human does no matter life's bringing to our plate this movie is not just about a dolphin but its about finding friends in the least expected places. and about family and what is family really about... everyone should go and see... also take a chance to goto the clearwater aquarium,Dolphin Tale
56,mozu517,Great for Kids & Adults Together,8,23 June 2012,"I have several thoughts about this movie: First of all, I find it VERY difficult to find movies that both kids & adults can enjoy together, and this is definitely one! Second, I was hesitant to watch this myself, because it disturbs me to see animals hurt (like the animal-cop reality shows). Luckily, that part was downplayed. Third, as an amputee myself I'm hyper-aware of the way in which people (or animals!) with disabilities are portrayed. This movie is very positive, not sappy or condescending at all. Finally, it offered a ""teachable moment"" for me & the 10-yr-old I was sitting for. Very touching, though--made me cry several times.",Dolphin Tale
57,llaws,Inspiring,10,18 October 2011,"This is one of the best movies I have ever seen. Great for the whole family. The story behind Winter is inspiring to many, even those without handicapping conditions. A great cast of actors adds to the movie's appeal. Judd, Connick, Freeman and the whole cast is excellent. The movie adds some things to the background story for dramatic effect. Even with this the movie still portrays Winter's story and the ultimate goal of the Clearwater Marine Aquarium very well. For those who are able I would highly recommend both seeing the movie and then taking a trip to the Clearwater Marine Aquarium in Clearwater, FL to see Winter in person and learn more behind her amazing story.",Dolphin Tale
58,huntclan-148-10669,Everything to love!,10,31 August 2011,"I brought my 8 year old daughter with me to preview Dolphin Tale and we both LOVED it! This is a perfect family movie and I couldn't recommend it enough. The message was positive and although there were some heavy topics addressed - it wasn't over the top... you leave feeling good with lots to think about. This isn't just a movie that encourages you to never give up. It did a great job bringing up real issues like self-image, pride, acceptance of those who are different, self-worth, homeschooling, importance of family, the power of a good family, the value of family. It addresses family relationships, friendship with those who are different, public school issues... oh, and so much more! This movie opens opportunity for discussion with your kids OR you can just go and enjoy the story. Can't wait to see it again in September!",Dolphin Tale
59,septhdr-156-627329,What a great film!,10,10 September 2011,"Congrat's Charlie Smith, you've done it again. Congrat's Andrew Kosove and Broderick Johnson...and Bob Engelman. I've been a part of a lot of films in our industry, as an actress, a choreographer, a director...and there are only a handful of great films you can point too, that you can watch over and over and over, and it never gets old. Dolphin Tale will be added to that list. From Morgan Freeman to Ashley Judd, all of the actors were phenomenal. The child actor Nathan Gamble pours his little heart into this one, and will become the new it young actor. Harry Connick Jr. is the dad of all dads, and the young actress Cozi Zuehlsdorff will will eventually become a wonderful little actress if she stays away from troublemakers in the industry. There were also a lot of successful actors in the supporting cast that helped make this film one for the ages. like, Frances Sternhagen, Kris Kristofferson, Ray McKinnon, Jim Fitzpatrick, Marc Macauly and Richard Libertini. And last but not least Winter. If you love animals and/or Dolphins..you too will love Dolphin Tale!",Dolphin Tale
60,septhdr-163-372499,"OMG, totally loved this film.",10,18 September 2011,"Without going into a dissertation of my life and background I went to the Warner Brother's Premiere last night at the village theater in Westwood and my eyes were watery almost the entire movie. Being an animal lover and activist I would equate this film in it's quality to several other extremely successful animal feature films, which I love and watch, over and over again.Dolphin Tale reminded me of some of the greatest animal films I've ever seen, such as 'My Dog Skip' 'Born Free' 'Babe' 'Old Yeller' 'Marley and Me' Benji' 'Free Willy' 'Lassie' and 'Flipper' but better! The family relationships between Ashley Judd and Nathan Gamble (mother & son) and then Gamble and Austin Stowell (1st cousins) and then Stowell and his parents Kim Ostrenko (Judd's sister) and Jim Fitzpatrick (Judd's brother in law & Stowell's father) and then Gamble and Winter the Dolphin and then Winter and Gamble and Cozi Zuehlsdorff (Gamble's new best friend) and her dad Harry Connick Jr (Marine Biologist) and then Connick and his dad Kris Kristofferson...was priceless.The story of Winter obviously is what drives this film, but it the relationships is what makes this movie so emotional and visceral. Everyone will be able to associate themselves with these relationships.Not to mention that the film is beautifully shot and it appears as though the town of Clearwater beach is a a cozy little beautiful place.This may be THEE BEST animal movies EVER made...EVER!",Dolphin Tale
61,kerryjonewton,Excellent Family Movie!,10,24 September 2011,"This film was enjoyed by everyone in my family yesterday. My husband, 10 year old daughter and 12 year old son all fell in love with the characters in this movie. Not only does it have great actors, but it is chalk full of great messages; lots of lessons to be learned here. You will not be disappointed! Take your family, knowing you won't have to cringe due to, even a hint of, profanity or pornography. You can sit back, relax, laugh and learn while you enjoy a story that is not just about a dolphin, but about families who realize that nothing is impossible,even when faced with adversities that seem hopeless. Never give up!",Dolphin Tale
62,momofjoeysamnate,"Wonderful, family-friendly movie!",10,24 September 2011,"I took my two older boys (and many other families from our home-school group) to see the movie yesterday, and we all LOVED it! Very family- friendly (don't see any reason for the PG rating?!) It was uplifting and encouraging for all of us, especially friends who have loved ones in the military who have suffered loss of limb (and more!) and still find hope, in part due to motivational films like this one!! There is a strong message of courage, perseverance, and hope throughout!! We also enjoyed the child actors (Nathan Gamble and Cozi Zuehlsdorff) - both were excellent and it is encouraging to see home-schooled children make a ""splash"" in Hollywood without stooping to bad-words and disrespectful attitudes as the catch for drawing viewers! Although the young boy character, Sawyer, begins the movie with a troubled attitude and dislike for school, we watch his interest and passions evolve throughout the movie, which leads to an attitude improvement toward his Mom, as well. Also enjoyed Morgan Freeman's performance, as the compassionate and caring Dr. McCarthy. Really, every actor performance was top-notch, in my opinion! We recommend this film for everyone!!",Dolphin Tale
63,fernrichardson,"Sweet, Heartwarming Story",8,24 September 2011,"This is the true story of the people who helped save a dolphin whose tail was caught in a crab trap and a dolphin who, in return, was able to lift the spirits of all the people who have crossed her path. I challenge anyone to see the movie and not feel that the world is just a little better when humans show compassion for animals and allow the animal kingdom to return the favor.***SPOILER WARNING***Just a heads up so you can make an informed decision about whether it is OK for young children: one character serves in the Army and comes back from the Middle East with an injury to his spine and leg. I thought the issue was dealt with compassionately and in an age-appropriate manner considering the movie is PG, but I could see how that character might generate some angst for an especially sensitive kid. The movie does end happily and is overwhelmingly positive throughout.",Dolphin Tale
64,soccerstar9486,amazing,10,26 December 2011,"I would have to say this is my favorite movie. If my grandmother was alive today she would have loved it also. Every year when she went to Florida she took pictures after pictures of dolphins for me. This movie was amazing. It showed how fishing boats are cruel to animal life and how they harm such innocent animals. It always shows how children and adults with disabilities are the same as you and I and how they can be hero's as well. This movie does not stereotype people or judge people for what they look like or their race. It is amazing, there is no other words to describe how much I enjoyed this movie. A child with disabilities will find comfort in knowing they are not alone in this world and that there are many people who look or feel like they do.. It truly supports the military and how they feel when they return from the war torn countries overseas. The men and women who are traumatized or disabled due to war can participate and produce such amazing events such as Save Winter Day.. The men and women in uniform represent you and I and if it wasn't for them we wouldn't be watching such amazing videos such as Dolphin Tale.",Dolphin Tale
65,zachthebeast123,Dolphin tail is garbage!,1,17 January 2012,"This movie is garbage! My family rented it because they though it would be good. It ended up being complete garbage. The first problem was the actors. The kid was awful, and even Morgan freeman delivered an uninspired performance. I'm surprised that it didn't ruin their godforsaken careers. The second problem was the graphics. You could clearly tell the dolphins were computer generated. The fake ""non-tail"" was completely unconvincing, and the overall look of the film was horrible. The final problem was the predictability of the film.it was clear what would happen by watching the preview. I highly recommend not renting this film, and especially not buying it. It was truly garbage. If you watch it, you will be truly disappointed.",Dolphin Tale
66,hrishi-bardhan,An Incredibly Bad Film,1,28 February 2012,"This film, or should be called movie, does not check off any of the following: Good Acting, Good Story, Good Cinematography, Good Screenplay, Good Direction, and Good Visual Effects. For me, this movie was not an enjoyment. Dolphin Tale did not even reach the standard for many child movies, which are already categorized as ""Bad"". I have no respect at all for this movie. Not one bit. Everything was overly acted, which did not allow the viewer to understand the movie. The way the screenplay was written was another reason why the acting was off. There was no emotion or realism in the dialog, which made it sound very plain. I am very unimpressed with the writers. This movie will not be remembered at all in the future. In my opinion this is not a well made movie. I hope that next time the writers, director, and actors will be better in their next movie, hopefully becoming known as a film.",Dolphin Tale
67,devosmaxime,Great MOVIE,10,4 June 2012,"Really great movie, Nice popular cast, and based on a true stroy makes it everythung wurth of seeing the movie. Its one of the best movies with animals that i like the best.The story of Dolphin Tale is very inspirational and uplifting. It teaches us not to give up when all seems hopeless. Winter lost her tail and the aquarium was poised to close down due to financial issues. After the aquarium exhausted all possible options, they had to sell the aquarium, but no other centres are willing to accept Winter. The last option they have was to put her down peacefully. Despite the hopelessness, young Sawyer Nelson (played by Nathan Gamble) refuses to give up. After witnessing a mother and her little girl who has only one leg were willing to drive hours up from out of town just to see Winter, Sawyer came up with a brilliant plan that can save this handicapped dolphin. Although Sawyer failed many of his school subjects, he is indeed brilliant. His mom was surprised by his knowledge, commitment and intelligence, brought forth by what he was interested in.",Dolphin Tale
68,betternow,Really a boy's tale,4,2 April 2016,Seems like I'm in a minority here. I wanted to see a dolphin but the dolphin is a minor part. It's really more about the humans. AND why does Hollywood always have to make every movie a romance? They even give little kids a girlfriend or boyfriend and it takes up a lot of time. In every movie there is romance and often sex that if you fast forward you miss nothing but reduces a 90 minute movie to an hour. This is not a dolphin's tale (even though the title is a play on words tail/tale) but a boy's tale. The first hour is about humans. Children will enjoy it but may be bored in the scenes where the dolphin isn't on screen which is most of the time.,Dolphin Tale
69,ljthomasljt,What a treat!,10,24 September 2011,"What a treat! I attended an Advance Screening of DOLPHIN TALE in RealD 3D in Ottawa on Saturday, September 17 at 10:00am at Empire 7 Theatre. This is a movie for ""Everyone of All Ages"", not just kids. I would dare to suggest that Parents should not drop off the kids to see this film but share this movie with your children. It is a very enjoyable, uplifting and heartwarming film that you will definitely enjoy seeing with your children. Grandparents will also enjoy seeing this film with their grandchildren. It is also a factual and enlightening film based upon a true story and is not ""a fantasy film"", such a the ""Free Willy"" type of films. I highly recommend that you put this on your ""Must See"" list and if you cannot make it to the theatre it will make a great Christmas gift or stocking stuffer. Thank you so very much, Warner Bros. Pictures Canada and Empire Theatres!",Dolphin Tale
