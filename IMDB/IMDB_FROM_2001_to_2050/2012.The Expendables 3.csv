0,Leofwine_draca,A step down...but still fun,6,4 January 2015,"I think THE EXPENDABLES franchise peaked with number two in the series - a great, rip-roaring action flick of yesterday, complete with a crazed Van Damme and one-liners aplenty. This third outing is a step down from that, and it's actually worse than the original as well, although not without its moments.The main issue with THE EXPENDABLES 3 is that the script gives over much of the screen time to a young, inexperienced bunch of 'new' expendables, played by no-name actors. I don't know about you, but I want to see Arnie, Jet Li & Dolph Lundgren kicking it up on-screen, not a group of people I don't know and have no interest in. Other than that, it's business as usual, although there are fewer one-liners here...which is a shame, as the ones that are present work very nicely.Other decent elements of the film include a couple of new, appropriate faces in the form of Antonio Banderas and (in particular) Wesley Snipes, who bags a wicked tax evasion joke early on. As in MACHETE KILLS, Mel Gibson makes for a fine villain, and the film really picks up in the last half hour with one of those all-out-action climaxes that reminded me of the likes of COMMANDO. I enjoyed it overall, even while noting that it's not quite of the calibre of previous entries.",The Expendables 3
1,SnoopyStyle,lots of stuff gets blown up,6,28 May 2015,"Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) leads Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), Gunner Jensen (Dolph Lundgren) and Toll Road (Randy Couture) to rescue old-time Expendable Doc (Wesley Snipes) from foreign prison. Ross is shocked that old nemesis arms dealer Conrad Stonebanks (Mel Gibson) is still alive after assuming to have killed him. Ross ends the Expandables and recruits newbies to take down Stonebanks.It starts with overwhelming explosive mayhem. The mistake in this one is to sideline the regular team to introduce a bunch of newbies. The middle section is missing the old team comradery. It's missing the light humor from Statham. Harrison Ford not understanding Statham is funny. Arnold's chopper is fine but it needs a punchline from somebody else to make fun of it. Antonio Banderas is nowhere as funny as the movie thinks he is. The body count in the final section gets ridiculous but I don't necessarily mind that. That's what everybody is known for. Mel Gibson is pretty good as a bad guy. This is not a particularly good movie but a lot of stuff gets blown up.",The Expendables 3
2,Prismark10,Creaking near you,5,16 August 2014,"Th Expendables continue by getting more action stars young and old. Barney (Sylvester Stallone) and other Expendables rescue Doc (Wesley Snipes) in prison for tax evasion!Doc re-joins Barney and the rest of the crew to stop an arms dealer only to find its a former expendable who is running the show, Conrad Stonebanks (Mel Gibson.)Harrison Ford is the CIA officer that wants the The Expendables to kill Stonebanks and Barney decides to get new, younger blood which includes a kick ass lady. The new Expendables go to Bucharest but their mission fails. The old team re-unite to rescue the new team.The Expendables 3 which leaked online has now been officially released but with a PG 13 rating to go for a younger audience which means less visceral and bloody violence. There are laughs, lots of action at the beginning but it tails off in the middle of the film.The film is entertaining, brainless fun, plenty of wisecracks, an all star ensemble but it also feels a little soggy as well.",The Expendables 3
3,claudio_carvalho,"Shutdown Your Brain, Don't Think, Enjoy It and Have Fun!",7,2 August 2014,"Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) and The Expendables rescue Doc (Wesley Snipes), who has been imprisoned for eight years, from a train that is transporting him to a maximum security prison. Doc joins Barney, Lee Christmas (Jason Statham ), Gunner (Dolph Lundgren), Toll Road (Randy Couture) and Hale Caesar (Terry Crews) in the assignment of stopping the dealer Victor Mins during a transaction of bombs. However they discover that the dealer is actually the former Expendable Conrad Stonebanks (Mel Gibson) that shots Hale Caesar badly. The Expendables take their friend to the hospital and Barney meets Trench (Arnold Schwarzenegger) in the waiting room that tells that they are old. Then he has a meeting with the operating officer Max Drummer (Harrison Ford) that had hired The Expendable to kill Victor and he gives one last chance to Barney to fix the problem. Barney concludes that his crew is old and decides to recruit a new and faster team with the support of his friend Bonaparte (Kelsey Grammar). Barney hires Thorn (Glen Powell), Luna (Ronda Rousey), Mars (Victor Ortiz) and the rebel John Smilee (Kellan Lutz) and .refuses the cooperation of his old team. They head to Bucharest but their mission fails and only Barnes escapes from Stonebanks. Now Barney intends to return to rescue his team with the outcast Galgo (Antonio Banderas). However his old team is like a family and they will never leave Barney fighting alone because family fights together to protect a member.""The Expendables 3"" is another entertaining adventure of this group of action actors that does not stop to grow. The team lost Bruce Wilis, but now Wealey Snipes, Mel Gibson, Harrison Ford, Antonio Banderas and Ronda Rousey has joined the cast. The plot is the usual, lots of action, shootings, deaths and fun, but entertains a lot. Shut down your brain, do not think and you will certainly have a good-time. My vote is seven.Title (Brazil): ""Os Mercenários 3"" (""The Mercenaries 3"")",The Expendables 3
4,nogodnomasters,WOULD YOU LIKE TO HOLD MY GUN?,9,17 April 2018,"The film opens with the usual impossible rescue scene. This time it is to rescue Wesley Snipes who will be known as Dr. Death. To his dismay they did so because they needed a fifth for a mission, one that fails. Stallone must go after Mel Gibson, who is not dead, really, but decides to retire his team because he fears for their life. Kelsey Grammer helps him recruit a new team, one that is more akin to an MIB force which includes Kellen Lutz, Ronda Rousey, and Victor Ortiz. Things go their formulaic way and the old guys plus the very talkative Antonio Banderas join the picture...again.Harrison Ford flew a helicopter like Hans Solo, Jet Li had a minor role that we can see expanding, and of course Arnold is back.The film is lengthy and spends time to quickly develop all the new players. The banter was not as good as the previous films, but was still acceptable. Banderas' character has ""Peter Sellers"" potential as a screw up who seems to luck into things.What best came out of this film was the potential for the next one.Parental Guide: 1-2 F-bombs. No sex or nudity.",The Expendables 3
5,kosmasp,Actually Expendable,6,27 October 2014,"The movie actually tries to show that our main actors are Expendable. To the main character that is (portrayed by Mr. Stallone as you will know by now). While the story is progressing (sort of), it still can be watched by anyone who hasn't seen the other movies. You may ask yourself how some people get cast in this movie (especially the younger recruits), but it's supposed to be a fresh start.Doesn't work as well as Stallone hoped, but the addition of Ford, but especially Wesley Snipes and Antonio Banderas helps elevate the movie further than it might have gone. The PG-13 stigma probably didn't help the cinema version (only one I have seen so far), but at least the action at the end was really good too. So while there is a lot of bad stuff that we could've done without (not talking about Mel Gibson, also one of the Highlights of the movie), the movie is not half as bad, as some have written ...",The Expendables 3
6,classicsoncall,"""""Come on, we're late for a war.""",7,13 October 2018,"I don't think it was a good idea to bring in a 'B' team to replace the original Expendables, even if some of the members delivered a different skill set. Thorn (Glen Powell) provided some electronics expertise and Antonio Banderas was a blast as Galgo, but after that, I'd rather have seen the mission handled by all the original players. If you think about it, Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) caved pretty easily on keeping his old buddies on board after all that fuss about going it alone with a new team. I didn't expect him to be wishy washy on that point, but if he hadn't, things might have gotten a little tiresome with all the new faces. Mel Gibson made for a pretty effective villain, but the attempts to out-scowl Stallone got pretty tedious after a while. I like the idea of big names like Harrison Ford and Kelsey Grammer showing up in the rotation to keep things interesting, which is part of the reason the newcomers didn't turn me on so much; I'd never heard of any of them except for Ronda Rousey, and only because of her martial arts background. Not to belabor the point, the gunfire and explosions are still part of the formula in this third installment of the Expendables series, but at this point, the franchise might actually be living up to it's name.",The Expendables 3
7,jboothmillard,The Expendables 3,5,28 August 2014,"The first film was okay, but the second film was much better and exciting, so I had just as high expectations that the third would deliver as much kick as the previous instalment, especially with more great action stars of the 80s and 90s in the cast. Basically Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) and his crack team The Expendables, Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), Gunner Jensen (Dolph Lundgren) and Toll Road (Randy Couture), work together to break out a former member from a military prison, imprisoned for eight years for tax evasion, knives specialist and team medic Doctor Death aka 'Doc' (Wesley Snipes). They recruit him to assist them in intercepting a shipment of bombs that will be delivered to be a warlord in Somalia, also reuniting with the team is Hale Caesar (Terry Crews), but during the operation Ross recognises the arms dealer providing the bombs, former co-founder of The Expendables, Conrad Stonebanks (Mel Gibson), who was thought to be dead following his betrayal for illegal weapons dealing. A firefight ensues and the team are forced to retreat, as Stonebanks and his men have advanced weapons, in the process Caesar is severely injured and put in hospital, Ross blames himself and tells the rest of the team that it is over between them, and he leaves for Las Vegas. There Ross recruits retired mercenary Bonaparte (Kelsey Grammar) to help him find younger mercenaries to join a new Expendables team, they find and recruit ex-Marine John Smilee (Twilight's Kellan Lutz), nightclub bouncer Luna (Ronda Rousey), computer expert Thorn (Glen Powell) and weapons expert Mars (Victor Ortiz), only turning down Spanish skilled sharpshooter Galgo (Antonio Banderas) who was keen to join. CIA operative and missions manager for The Expendables, Max Drummer (Harrison Ford), who has replaced Mr. Church, and Ross's rival Trench Mauser (Arnold Schwarzenegger), have traced Stonebanks who is heading for Romania to make another arms deal with trader Goran Vata (Licence to Kill's Robert Davi), but they ordered to bring him back alive to face punishment for his crimes. Ross and the new recruits are successful in infiltrating Stonebanks's office building and capture him for delivery, in the van he taunts until his men catch up to them, fire a missile at the van and let him loose, while Ross is thrown into the ravine, Smilee, Luna, Thorn and Mars are captured. Ross is sent a video from Stonebanks challenging him to come for him, preparing to leave Galgo finds Ross wanting to help him in the mission, he is given a chance, soon enough Christmas, Jensen, Road and Doc also turn up to reunite as The Expendables and take on Stonebanks in the abandoned building he is holding the recruits. They raid the building, but find that the place is rigged by explosives, but using a battery- powered device Thorn is able to delay the explosion countdown, they are also joined in their mission by Drummer, Mauser and retired member Yin Yang (Jet Li) who are attacking in a helicopter, they all work together to kill the hundreds of men and destroy all weaponry. Ross and Stonebanks brutally fight each other hand to hand until Ross finally kills him, just as the explosives countdown delay runs out and the building starts to collapse, the team and Ross hanging make it onto the helicopter and fly away to safety, in the end Caesar recovers, Ross welcomes Galgo and the new recruits to the complete team and they all celebrate in a bar. Stallone is still a suitable leader, Gibson is a good choice for the snarling villain, Banderas is amusing as the eager Spaniard, Ford as usual is chiselled but a welcome addition, Snipes makes a good comeback, and the other supporting action stars still do well also. I heard many stories about this film before and during its production, including Bruce Willis dropping out after Stallone refused his demand of $1 million a day, and then of course the attention with casting Gibson, Ford and Snipes, so I was very much hoping the actual finished product would be as interesting as the publicity surrounding it. The story is pretty straight forward, it is a little annoying when the film slows down a bit with chatty moments and the perhaps too long recruitment bits, but the explosions, gun fire and chase sequences stop it from being boring, maybe not as exciting as the second instalment, but still a fun action adventure. Worth watching!",The Expendables 3
8,Tweekums,Plenty of action from start to finish,7,1 September 2016,"This, the third film in the series, opens with Barney Ross, Lee Christmas and the team rescuing former team member Doc from a heavily armoured train that was taking him to high security prison. They then head to Mogadishu to prevent an arms shipment. The mission goes wrong and Barney identifies the reason as Conrad Stonebanks; a former comrade gone bad who Barney thought he'd killed some time ago. He is determined to get him this time but doesn't want to risk his team. The CIA want Stonebanks alive so Barney and a team of new, young Expendables set off to capture him. It appears that the mission has been a success but then the tables are turned and the new team is captured while Barney escapes. Stonebanks challenges Barney to come and rescue his new team and to do that he will inevitably need the old team, as well as some old friends and an enthusiastic Spaniard named Galgo. This all leads to an explosive finale and an inevitable fight between Barney and Stonebanks.Those who enjoyed the first two films in the series will know what to expect; an ensemble of action stars getting together to cause mayhem. The plot is a bit cliché but that doesn't really matter as there is plenty of over the top action. The cast do a solid enough job although some are distinctly underused, or in Jet Li's case hardly used at all. Wesley Snipes and Antonio Banderas are welcome additions to the team but it is Mel Gibson who stands out thanks to his performance as Stonebanks. There is a very high body count but somehow the violence feels a bit toned down; I guess that is why it got a '12' certificate in the UK rather than a '15' like the previous outings. Overall a decent enough film if you want some brain-in-neutral action and plenty of familiar faces.",The Expendables 3
9,paul_haakonsen,Hard-pounding action and tons of gunfights,8,16 August 2014,"The third installment of ""The Expendables"" is right up there alongside with the previous two movies. Not only in adrenaline, action and impressive action stars on the cast list.Without going too deep into the storyline here, then Barney has a conflict of morales and have a falling out with his team, and he has to recruit a team of new blood in order to go after a former team member who went rogue and was left for dead.The movie is a little bit slow at the start, but it quickly picks up pace and then it just steamrolls continuously on towards the very end.Wesley Snipes was really a welcomed addition to the movie, because he played his role so well. I can't really say the same for Antonio Banderas, well for his character that is, because the character was just a royal pain in the... Well, you get the drift. Antonio Banderas himself did a good job portraying this annoying character though. Kelsey Grammar was a bit out of his usual playing field, but all in all, then he also did bring something new to the movie, despite having a supporting role only. Mel Gibson did a good job with the role as the villain. And finally Harrison Ford also popped in for an exciting visit.Having grown up with the action movies of Stallone, Statham, Schwarzenegger, Lundgren and Li, then ""The Expendables"" (all three of them) are like everything you wished for in a movie as a child. All of your action heroes coming together for the ultimate action blast.If you enjoyed the previous two movies, then you will also enjoy ""The Expendables 3"". No doubt about it.",The Expendables 3
10,sunwarrior13,Time To End The Franchise,9,26 December 2014,"The Expendables 3 is the third ensemble action film of The Expendable Franchise.It stars Sylvester Stallone together with Jason Statham,Antonio Banderas,Jet Li,Wesley Snipes,Dolph Lundgren,Kelsey Grammar,Randy Couture,Terry Crews,Kellan Lutz,Ronda Rousey,Glen Powell,Victor Ortiz,Robert Davi,Mel Gibson,Harrison Ford and Arnold Schwarzenegger.The third film is about a group of elite mercenaries called The Expendables that come into conflict with ruthless arms dealer Conrad Stonebanks, the co-founder of the team, who is determined to destroy and dismantle the group into pieces.This was written by Sylvester Stallone together with Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt and it was directed by Patrick Hughes.The Expendables come face-to-face with Conrad Stonebanks,who co- founded The Expendables with Barney.Subsequently,Stonebanks became a ruthless arms trader and someone the team is after.Now,the arms trader intend to dismantle the group before it gets to him but Barney has other plans and makes it a mission to bring him down with the help of new team members that who are younger, faster and more tech-savvy. At this point,it is probably time to end the movie franchise as it has become a repeat of the first and second movie in terms explosive action scenes and over-the-top dialogues as well as formulaic plot elements expected from it.Despite of having new,engaging and entertaining characters particularly Expendable recruits and villains,it still manages to be enjoyable and entertaining but not at the level of the first and second film.Also,it has reached a point that it no longer deserves another sequel.",The Expendables 3
11,Theo Robertson,Botox,6,10 December 2014,"I had relatively high hopes for this since I found the second film in the series relatively enjoyable . You know what you're going to get in advance , lots of mindless action and snappy one liners and here there's an added bonus - meta-fiction . Snipes character states he had a little bit of a problem with tax evasion . And if the IRS aren't after one of the expendables then the CIA are after a bad guy played by Mel Gibson ! What's he wanted for you ask ? Arms dealing on the black market I think , but since he's played by Gibson one of the most deeply unpleasant individuals working in Hollywood it could be a number of any organisations you want to name . Such as Mossad , or the English Defence League , or the feminist lobby or African American groups , or the American draft board evangelical Protestants or ...hold on it seems like the only people who don't want to throw Gibson in jail are the CIA . Gibson must have found his role a challenge As you expect this is the type of film featuring lots of stunts and explosions and editing by someone who has taken a near fatal overdose of cocaine so what sets it apart from its peers ? One word: Botox That's right - botox . You can see the results a mile away and certain persons in this film look like they've been the result of a genetic experiment where mad scientists have created a hybrid of a human being with a fish . That't probably explains why the same people have trouble saying their lines because there faces are a bit too stretched out . "" If God wanted us to fly he would have given us feathers "" spouts one cast member who probably has never been near a botox clinic . Maybe the meta-fiction in this film is either appropriate or ironic . Make up your own mind",The Expendables 3
12,LeonLouisRicci,Ultimately Undone by the Bloat and the PG-13 Rating,5,9 February 2015,"In a Movie that has So Many (albeit aging) Stars there has to be Someone or Something that is Worth Seeing or Commenting. Here's One. Those Aging, Bloated, Wrinkling ""Actors"" have a Screen Presence that Command when Compared to the ""Young Turks"" that are brought On Screen to Share in the Glory. Those Fresh (and unwrinkled) Faces are So Bland and Lacking of Charisma that it is Testament (and testosterone) to the ""Old School's"" Power. These Youngsters are Bush League in Comparison.Speaking of Baseball. Watching these Fogies being Restrained and Substituted with Stunt Doubles is Akin to Attending and Old Timers Day. It's Like Watching a Former Fire Ball Pitcher Lob the Ball to the Plate and Former Sluggers Swing for the Fences and Only Manage to Hit a Blooper Over Second Base.Or Another Analogy Might be Viewing a Former Kick-Ass Rock Band, Now in Their 50's, Rock the House with Lame Versions of Previous Killer Riffs. So it is with the Expendables Franchise and to Make Matters Worse, Here Comes the Dreaded PG-13 Rating and that's the Nail in the Coffin. Mel Gibson Makes the Best Impression with Harrison Ford On Board Trying Not to Look Bored. Antonio Banderas and Wesley Snipes Sign On and are a Welcomed Relief from the Same Old, but a Few Inspired Scenes are Not Worth the Price of Admission. It's Like One of those Old Disaster Movies that have a Multitude of ""Names"" Filling the Poster to Attract Audiences. Speaking of Disasters...",The Expendables 3
13,zardoz-13,One of the Best!!!,10,3 September 2014,"More bang for your buck is what you get with ""The Expendables 3."" Sylvester Stallone reprises his role as good guy mercenary-for-hire Barney Ross, with Lee Christmas (Jason Statham), Gunner Jensen (Dolph Lundgren), Toll Road (Randy Couture), and Caesar (Terry Crews) at his side. Unlike ""The Expendables 2"" (which I enjoyed thoroughly), ""Expendables 3"" shuns most of the clever one-liners from earlier films that the hard-knuckled screen icons appeared in during their prime. Nevertheless, co-star Arnold Schwarzenegger gets to recycle his ""Predator"" line ""Get to the chopper,"" and his ""Commando"" line ""I lied."" ""Red Hill"" director Patrick Hughes and original ""Expendables"" scenarist Sylvester Stallone along with ""Olympus Has Fallen"" co-scribes Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt struggle but succeed to infuse enough spontaneity into this predictable but entertaining nonsense that foregoes the blood & gore of the two earlier R-rated entries. The worst thing about the third ""Expendables"" epic is that you know what will happen even though it is gratifying when it occurs. Unfortunately, neither martial arts sensation Jet Li nor multiple welterweight boxing champion Victor Ortiz has a chance to display their respective skills. Unless we're given a chance to catch the three-and-a-half-hour rough cut of the film, we'll never know if they did show-off their skills. Those who've seen the first two ""Expendables"" will enjoy the allusions to those actioneers. Barney Ross had to hump it in ""The Expendables"" when he scrambled hell-bent-for-leather down a dock toward his seaplane as hundreds of bullets perforated the planks at his heels. ""Expendables 3"" gives Stallone another chance to hump it under conditions far worse than anything that he faced in the first film. While the action has a delightful, dog-eared quality to it, the spectacle of star power compensates for the déjà vu familiarity. Fresh out of real-life prison for tax evasion, ""Blade"" star Wesley Snipes, who went toe-to-toe with Stallone in the 1993 thriller ""Demolition Man,"" is still an action star to respect. Mel Gibson makes an awesome adversary who we are told co-founded the mercenary force with Barney. The ""Lethal Weapon"" star qualifies as a first-rate dastard with treachery to spare. The biggest surprise is ""Zorro"" star Antonio Banderas, who is cast as a loquacious Hispanic suffering from survivor's guilt. ""Indiana Jones"" star Harrison Ford replaces Bruce Willis as Stallone's new CIA contact. Clocking in at a rather lengthy 127 minutes, ""Expendables 3"" pits our heroes against an army of evil antagonists equipped with tanks and helicopters galore. From its adrenaline-laced opening sequence involving a slam-bang aerial rescue from a prison train to its war-as-hell finale, this polished Lionsgate release should assuage the appetites of action fans until the rumored fourth installment comes out.""Expendables 3"" opens with an explosive, rip-snorting, action set-piece as Barney flies a helicopter with Lee Christmas, Gunnar, and Toll Road riding shotgun with automatic weapons. They are out to rescue one of their old comrades, Doctor Death (Wesley Snipes) who is locked up like a serial killer on a heavily-fortified train bound for a maximum security prison. Naturally, bullets fly by the billions, and the villains cannot hit the side of an invisible barn, while the bodies pile up with little in the way of blood & gore. Interestingly, ""Expendables 3"" is the first in the franchise to obtain a PG-13 rating. Once aboard Barney's chopper heading home, Doctor Death borrows Gunnar's enormous, pig-sticker of a knife and shaves himself. I haven't any action hero shave himself with a knife since Lee Van Cleef did in the 1968 Spaghetti western ""Death Rides A Horse."" Anyway, Barney needs Doctor Death for a job in Somalia, and everything appears to be going splendidly for our aged but agile mercenaries until Barney gets the shock of his life. A villain shows up who turns out to be one of the Expendables' founding fathers, Conrad Stonebanks (Mel Gibson of ""Lethal Weapon""), and he shows Barney that Barney's best days may be behind him. Stonebanks has Barney in his gun sights, but he decides to blast away at Caesar before he blows the rest of them to kingdom come. Naturally, Barney and his pals survive this trial by combat, but our rugged, Spartan protagonist believes he needs new blood to nab the elusive Stonebanks. Several well-dressed CIA goons approach Barney outside the New Orleans hospital where Caesar's life hangs by a thread. Drummer (Harrison Ford of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"") isn't happy about the turn of events. Nevertheless, he wants to use Barney again to capture Stonebanks. The inevitable catch is that Barney must deliver the sadistic Stonebanks to The Hague, where Stonebanks will be put on trial as a war criminal. You see, Stonebanks has been selling weapons of every description for twenty years to anybody who can afford them. Originally, Barney thought he had killed Stonebanks, but the latter's body armor enabled him to survive the ordeal. Now, Stonebanks surrounds himself with an army of hired guns.After Barney delivers the bad news to his brothers-in-arms, he contacts a scruffy character, Bonaparte (Kelsey Grammar of ""Down Periscope""), to help him assemble a new team. The action slows down a mite during this phrase of the story so these two guys can audition replacements. Anybody who's seen any of ""The Magnificent Seven"" westerns knows what to expect during this interim. Barney enlists four youngsters who qualify as the toughest of the tough. Mars (Victor Ortiz), Smilee (Kellam Lutz of ""Twilight""), Thorn (Glen Powell of ""The Dark Knight Rises""), and a gal named Luna (MMA fighter Ronda Rousey) comprise his new team. This robust quartet can do virtually anything that Barney's old team did but with greater tech savvy. The catch here is that Mel Gibson's roguish Stonebanks is no slouch and has more than a few tricks hidden up his sleeve. Although all the usual clichés appear intact throughout ""Expendables 3,"" this testosterone-laden release packs more blood, sweat, and sneers than most entire action franchises.",The Expendables 3
14,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,The worst one yet,5,15 August 2014,"Arms dealer Stonebanks(Gibson, awesomely evil, and starts the trend of the aging icons who join this being the best part, especially from how they relate to the returning members, which is with tension and core conflict, often with Sly we miss them and their energy and talent whenever they aren't on screen) turns out to still be alive, and is determined to kill his former team, The Expendables. So group leader Barney(Stallone, enjoyable; and his fun facing off with CIA spook portrayed by Ford puts the latter's gruff authority to good use) he fires the people we paid to go see, immediately after freeing Doctor Death(Snipes, yes, that's what he's called here, and his rivalry with Statham, both of them knife-wielding long-time colleagues and close friends with Ross) and hiring Galgo(Banderas, who never shuts up, and is easily the most fun albeit it is a love-him-or-hate-him kind of thing), both of whom struggle to fit in with the established team. For a third or so, this is hijacked by the pilot for a spin-off series, or possibly the audition tapes for the next Mission Impossible movie... a modern spy thriller, at least. The young mercs are fine, even good at points, but they don't belong in this. And ultimately, the old guys are brought back in.Three films in, and we've abandoned the 80's throwback ""let's get these guys together"" concept. The original had a huge(albeit exhausting) climax, the second a massive opening, this has neither. All we do get are epic shots, and this straight-up steals the setup for the last 45 minutes from what I'm told is a far better picture. Did I mention this is an overlong two hours? The excessive number of characters reaches a new high or low, rather, and no one has much to do, even if the young blood actually have identities and roles in the missions. The PG-13 is felt, with bloody, gory violence completely trimmed(and the strong language toned down; people are still gunned down and blown up, you merely don't see any wounds or the like) to remove the edge, but it's the least of the problems here. In general, the ""over the top"" quality is just about gone. Every cool gag was in the trailer. In spite of the quality that aspect of the last sequel, the action here lacks variety, each sequence ends too soon, it's stealth-heavy and every mêlée fight is done in close-ups and edited to be too fast, eliminating the showcase of the martial arts of the youths that was part of the pitch here they certainly weren't hired for their acting chops.I recommend this solely to the most patient and forgiving fans. While never a good franchise, this is where it throws in the towel. 5/10",The Expendables 3

So Barney retires all his old friends and colleagues to avoid them being harmed, and recruits a new bunch.The first and second Expendables movie traded on the goodwill inherent in bringing together a batch of big-name action movie stars (albeit mostly well past their sell-by date). This one does the same, adding Antonio Banderas, Mel Gibson, Wesley Snipes. and Harrison Ford to the mix. But, for me, the law of diminishing returns is beginning to set in, and I found myself wanting a bit more plot. The action sequences are well-staged, but interminable and with a complete absence of credibility, being characterised by selective ammunition - every bullet fired by the Expendables finds its mark, and the thousands of spear-carriers fielded by the villains couldn't hit a barn door with a bazooka. There is never the slightest sense that any of the goodies - even the anonymous batch of young players recruited as the ""new bunch"" - is at risk. As a result, you never feel anything of importance is at stake during the action sequences, which means that you don't really care.If this series is to continue, it needs somebody on board on the script side who can introduce a degree of emotional investment.Antonio Banderas is quite funny.",The Expendables 3

The filmmakers' attempt to attract a younger audience by adding a ""new"" crew and dropping to a PG-13 rating backfires, and will not provide the legs this franchise needed for more installments.The regular old geezers are back: Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews, Randy Couture, Jet Li (briefly), and Arnold Schwarzenneger. In addition, we get new ""old"" blood in the form of Antonio Banderas, Kelsey Grammar, Wesley Snipes, Harrison Ford, and the dominating presence of Mel Gibson as the bad guy. The young blood comes in the form of Kellan Lutz, Glen Powell, boxer Victor Ortiz, and MMA superstar Ronda Rousey. The blandness of the newbies simply steals valuable screen time for the old folks, and the movie suffers because of it.The film's biggest flaw, however, comes with the biggest screen hog of all-time: Mr. Stallone. We understand that this is franchise is his baby, but why field an all-star team if you won't let them play? Snipes gets some time early in the film, replete with a reference to his real life prison sentence for tax evasion, and Ford and Arnold get in a few shots, but the only savior here is Mel Gibson. It's a reminder of just how good he can be on screen ... if we could just forget what a horrible person he can be off screen.There is no need to go into detail on the plot or describe any of the characters. You know what you are getting if you buy a ticket. It's just a shame the film's direction and script aren't at the level deserving of a cast that includes: Rambo, Mad Max, Blade, Conan, Han Solo, Hercules, Zorro, The Transporter, He-Man, and even ... Sideshow Bob!",The Expendables 3
18,morrison-dylan-fan,The Expendables:part 3.,4,14 August 2014,"Despite having greatly enjoyed watching the first 2 titles in the series,I originally decided to stay away from viewing the third Expendables movie,due to having discovered that the violence had been toned down,in order to make the series more family friendly.With a friend's birthday coming up,I decided to ask if there was any film that he wanted to see at the cinema,which led to me getting the rather surprising reply of ""Expendables 3"".Putting my doubts on the film to the side,I got set to go with my friend to find out how expendable the movie could be.The plot:Locating former team mate Doctor Death in a military prison, Barney Ross leads his gang into breaking Death out of prison,so that he can help them find the location on an arms shipment.Freed from prison,Death soon finds out that the arms are heading for a major war lord based in SomaliaArriving to Somalia,Ross and the rest of the gang are horrified to discover that the mysterious arms dealer is a man called Conrad Stonebanks,who along with being a co-founder of Ross's gang,is someone who Ross has for years believed to be dead. Believing that he and his team do not have all of the required skills to beat Stonebanks,Ross decides that it is time for him to allow outsiders to enter his gang.View on the film:Kicking things off with a blistering action scene,director Patrick Hughes disappointingly allows any sense of excitement to burn out right away,thanks to Hughes openly pulling his punches during the films set pieces.Hughes approach sadly leads to each of the action moments failing to land a knock out blow.Matching the restrained directing of Hughes,the terrible screenplay by Sylvester Stallone, Creighton Rothenberger, Katrin Benedikt and Dave Callaham attempts to ruin everything which has been built up in the first 2 movies.Throwing away any chance of the exciting openings impact on the rest of the title within the first 30 minutes,the writers use the appearance of ""The new expendables"" to make all of the lead characters look useless and completely out of step with the times.Originally starting the series off as he set off on his come back trail,Sylvester Stallone gives a shocking performance,which completely lacks any sparks of excitement that he had shown in the past.Following Stallone's performance,each of his fellow gang members give worn out, tied performances,which show a real lack of interest towards the title.Entering the film with an almighty kick, Wesley Snipes gives a joyful performance in the far too short role of Doctor Death,whilst Mel Gibson gives the film some desperately needed energy,as the wild & crazy baddie,which leads to Gibson and Snipes being the only 2 cast members who are far from expandable.",The Expendables 3
19,FlashCallahan,Christmas is coming.......,8,1 August 2014,"The team comes to loggerheads with Conrad Stonebanks, who co-founded The Expendables with Barney. Stonebanks became a ruthless arms trader and someone who Barney was forced to kill... or so he thought.Stonebanks, who cheated death once before, now is making it his mission to destroy The Expendables, but Barney has other plans.Barney brings in a new era of Expendables team members, recruiting individuals who are younger, faster and more tech-savvy.The latest mission becomes a clash of old-school versus high-tech expertise......it's third time lucky for Stallones' massive nostalgia project, and once again, you had to be a huge fan of eighties, and early nineties action to really enjoy the absurdity of it all.bar van Damme, The cast is the best yet, and kudos to Willis for being so greedy, as we are treated to Ford in his best supporting role in years, and even channeling Solo in the films action packed finale.Other great additions are Snipes, who really plays it down as the newly rescued from prison (tax evasion perhaps?) member, banderas, who does overdo it a little as the comic relief, but is so full of energy, and Gibson, who hasn't been this brilliant since Payback. seriously, dismiss all of his bad press, and you realise what a phenomenal actor the guy is. Not to mention a memorable villain.The downsides though are a pretty big deal. The idea of the young crew, isn't very well thought out, and wastes a huge chunk of the movie with recruiting, Stallones ridiculous outfits, and some very poor acting. And with this, we get very little screen time in the second act with the regulars, and it feels like they are more of a support, than the primary members.And Li is in it for a little over five minutes, and didn't really need to be in it.But if you put a lot into a film, you have to take a little out, and the gamble does pay off, but only just.The action is wonderful, and the chemistry between all the characters is still evident, and there are sparks of genius from series regulars, Lundgren, Schwarzeneggar, and Coutre, who is looking more like Gary Barlow everyday.It's a nostalgia trip, plain and simple, and I can understand why the film will be trashed by the critics, but then, Commando, Cobra, Red Scorpion, and Tango and Cash did back them, and they are now cult classics.And any film that warms the heart when Arnie shouts 'Get To The Chopppaaaaahhhh!', has to have the right intentions, doesn't it?Better than the first, as good as the second.",The Expendables 3
20,Aaron1375,"Lots of explosions like the other two movies, but they are weaker here",6,25 August 2014,"This is the third film in the Expendables series and by far the weakest and its box office showing probably should give Stallone and the filmmakers the definitive proof they need that this series did not ever need to be PG-13. The first movie was R and it is the only one to have grossed 100 plus million at the box office. The second one flirted with a PG-13 rating, but they added computer blood and stuff and probably salvaged that one. This one is PG-13 all the way and it just is not up to the other two films at all. Of course, it is not simply the rating that made this film a step down from the other two films, but also its focus. The whole point of the Expendable films was to showcase older action stars and tough guys. To bring us back to the past! Here, they almost do a passing of the torch bringing in like three or four young people who I've never seen before and add nothing to the film. I say three or four cause the only one that stands out in the new kids on the block is the female. The guys may have well been clones. So in the middle of the film the guys we want to see are hanging around their hotels while Stallone leads the new kids up against Mel Gibson, which is the other problem. Do not get me wrong, Gibson was great as the main villain, but there is no one else that stands out on the villain's side. However, it had its moments and had some good action, just not violent and curse laden as I would have liked and many others.The story has the Expendables breaking out a former member of the group who had been captured. Then they are on to stop a weapons dealer who ends up also being a former member. He takes injures one of the guys so Stallone now forcefully retires the rest of them because he does not want these old guys who know nothing else to get hurt and takes on younger people with their whole lives ahead of them to try and take out the weapons dealer. Makes sense...not! Well the old team will soon get back together and go on yet another mission together.The newcomers here are Harrison Ford who takes Willis' place. Wesley Snipes as the former member and Antonio Banderos as an aged military mercenary who talks a lot. Kelsey Grammar also is in the film playing a guy who is apparently Stallone's supplier or man on the street. All these guys do good, just would have been more awesome had they been in the first film when they allowed bad language and violence! Stallone is also in this one too much while the rest of his team not so much. The first film had Stallone get beaten bad by Stone Cold, but now he is the one who defeats the bad guy who is an over matched Mel Gibson. By over matched I mean he has no one awesome to assist him which means none of the other Expendables really get to showcase anything here. If they make another film, all newcomers should be on the bad guys side suffice to say.So, while it had its moments, it was by far the weakest of the Expendable films. They for some reason forgot the reason people flocked to the first film and just had to cater to that 13 to 16 age group who cannot go to a R film without being accompanied by a guardian. Why movie makers and all other advertising companies and such cater to such a very small size of the population is beyond me, I spend money too and I am more likely to go to a film while most youngsters will just watch it on the internet. So this film is for them and once again the new youth of America drags something that was fun and exciting and turns it to something that has lost its edge and luster. Take note Stallone, you finally decided to not listen to the people who said keep it R and now you have the poorest performing Expendables by far.",The Expendables 3
21,Wuchakk,"Least of the three, but still a fun action flick full of veterans from the 80s & 90s",5,17 November 2015,"Released in 2014, ""The Expendables 3"" stars Sylvester Stallone as Barney Ross, the leader of a group of mercenary veterans who are hired by the CIA to do their dirty work. On a mission the team encounters Conrad Stonebanks (Mel Gibson), who years ago co-founded The Expendables with Barney and was thought to be dead. Stonebanks has crossed over to the dark side and severely wounds one of The Expendables. Barney decides to fight old blood with new blood by enlisting several new team members after retiring the others (because he couldn't bear to see any of them die). Their mission is to capture Stonebanks to be tried for war crimes, which leads them to Romania where Stonebanks is set to make an arms deal.The Expendables franchise is a great way to get all those action stars from the 80s & 90s together for a fun action flick that balances quasi-seriousness with amusing moments and over-the-top action scenes. The new twist with this installment, of course, is the introduction of younger team members, not to mention the ousting of the old. Curvy Ronda Rousey easily stands out as one of the younger members, but not enough is done with her. The additions of Wesley Snipes and Antonio Banderas are a welcome change; both are equally effective in their own ways. However, except for the scenes with these two and the enlisting of the young guns, most of the rest of the movie just flashes by with lots of noise and ""exciting"" things going on. So it's the least of the three IMHO, but I'm sure it's a better film if you haven't seen the first two.The film runs 126 minutes and was shot in Romania and Bulgaria.GRADE: C+ or B-",The Expendables 3
22,mm-39,The Expendables gets better with each installment.,8,17 August 2014,"Expendables 1 the makers winged it and had a lot of fun. Expendable 2 they had way too many characters and had a lot of fun and got better. Expendable 3 just the right mix and got better. Expendables 3 action sequences where executed perfectly with relentless non stop action, which interchanged from one fight scene with another! I believe Expendables 3 action scenes will be copied by other movies. Memorable characters, Antonio Banderas comical character, surprisingly, stands out the most. There is not too much time spent on any one character, but just the right mix of many minor characters! Barney Ross (Sly) character drives the character driven story, which is about friendship, loyalty, what creates a group and group dynamics. Ross betrays some team mates for good reasons, and creates animosity with others underlines the story. One sees how new and old clash with ideas, how a group is forged. Well written, and directed, with a over the top climax. I believe the audience will be wanting more. Eight out of ten. I wonder if four could be better?",The Expendables 3
23,siderite,Best one yet,8,9 August 2014,"There is no doubt in my mind that this is the best Expendables yet. I was sourly disappointed by the first and thought the second was worse, but still I watched this one and I am pleased to say that it actually felt like a movie.OK, action scenes are either over the top, ridiculous or ridiculously over the top, while the story... who needs it anyhow? But the quality of the characters, the acting, the dialogues, all way better than in any previous installment, while the humor went to a higher level, more subtle, more funny.It was nice to see Snipes in an action movie. To get an action actor and put him in jail for years was probably horrific, and for what? Tax evasion. He played in this film and made fun of it. Respect. Not a lot of activity from the old crew, but also no random scenes that made no sense like before. The new people... well, they are young and lack a lot of the charisma that they needed, but perhaps that is going to change, if any more Expendables are to come. Harrison Ford was fine, Banderas was hilarious, but I think his role could have gone more towards his character's sadness and underlying insanity and less towards comic relief.Bottom line: Clearly done a lot better than the previous Expendables movies. Not in the sense that it made any sense, but production and people values. As for Bruce Willis, well... he's out of the picture.",The Expendables 3

This action extravaganza which completes the trilogy, is indeed Good Fun! And its such a pleasure to watch Hollywood Legend Mel Gibson stealing the show, by enacting the baddie to perfection!

And it does that well. Sylvester Stallone's Story & Screenplay is meant for the masses, as it delivers enough scope of human tension & explosive action. Although I'd like to point out, that, the first-hour of the film, is slightly slow-paced & dull. Its the second-hour which is arresting & the climax is simply brilliant.Patrick Hughes's Direction is satisfactory. Cinematography is dusky. Editing could've been more sharper. Costume Design is perfect. Action-Sequences are the mainstay of the film. Performance-Wise: After Mel Gibson, its Stallone who delivers a performance of substance. He leads the pack with toughness. Its also nice to see Harrison Ford, Wesley Snipes & Antonio Banderas joining in. They all play to the gallery well, as do the rest.On the whole, 'The Expendables 3' is a winner!",The Expendables 3
25,MovieAddict2016,"Poorly edited and, most importantly, lacking fun!",4,18 August 2014,"I was really excited for EX3 for some reason. I didn't care much about the PG-13 rating -- based on the trailer and the inclusion of fresh talent behind the lens, I thought Stallone was trying to take the franchise toward a Fast&Furious action film route, and I didn't necessarily have a problem with that if it turned out well enough. Plus, I miss Mel Gibson (if we judged actors on their personal lives there wouldn't be many fanclubs left) so the idea of seeing him chew up scenery as a villain sounded fun.But the movie...just sucks. The editing is bad. Patrick Hughes perhaps was overwhelmed with the $100 mil budget and didn't know how to handle the action sequences, or perhaps they were just toned down for the PG-13 rating, but they're often so quickly and chaotically chopped up that you can't even tell what's going on. The stunts have become self-parody (just witness Terry Crews flying through the air like he can fly during that car chase early on), and the movie lacks a fun narrative. It also lacks suspense.The introductions of the actors are so poorly handled. Arnold appears just randomly standing around in the back of a shot in a hospital. Huh? His appearance in EX2 was great. The sense of build-up is similarly lacking when Mel Gibson just stumbles into frame along with a bunch of other bad guys, or when Harrison Ford just shows up to grumble some Bruce Willis disses and then disappears for the rest of the movie... or when Jet Li just randomly appears next to Arnie for a single scene before peacing out.Wesley Snipes fares the best but that's not saying much. Gibson does the villain routine well enough but the role and the story background for his character just isn't fresh or deep enough to care too much about, so the big showdown between he and Stallone lacks even the dramatic weight of the surprisingly effective and dramatic Jean Claude Van Damme fight in EX2.Look, ultimately none of these movies have been great. Expendables 1 looked like a straight-to-DVD movie with horrible, bleak cinematography and lighting, but it scored a couple cool moments, like the church scene and that otherwise out-of-place epic Mickey Rourke monologue. (Speaking of which, Rourke is sorely missed.)EX2 went more for the comedy route which worked well enough, and it was a fun one-time viewing. Neither movies were particularly memorable, but they had memorable moments.EX3 had the opportunity to take the franchise in a new direction, but instead, it comes across as totally cold, cynical and calculated. It's also just not any fun. When Kelsey Grammar shows up to start bringing in the younger 'tech-savvy' recruits, I found myself surprised by how utterly bored I was. Guys like Kellen Lutz are black holes of charisma with little acting talent, so for them to take up a good portion of the movie's runtime is a crying shame.Ultimately, the PG-13 rating has nothing to do with the movie's faults, apart perhaps from the choppy action scene editing. Where the movie truly fails is that it is a giant moot point. The entire point of the Expendables is bringing back '80s action icons and having them go to war. By relegating them to supporting characters and bringing in younger recruits? That undermines the entire point of the franchise, and makes it seem like a very cynical attempt at moving forward with a younger cast to take over the reigns in the future. But that's not why people are paying to see these movies, as evidenced by its dwindling box office returns.",The Expendables 3
26,KineticSeoul,"New mission, new recruits...No blood.",3,11 August 2014,"I thought this franchise was suppose to a homage to the 80's and 90's action movies, because it tries to go with some of the cheesy current action movies. I think too much time was given with the new recruits, which I wouldn't have any complaint about if they were at least equally as entertaining or likable compared to the veterans. This seemed like a rehash of the second installment, except with a new villain, new recruits, one of the team member that goes down thus motivating Barney Ross. It's unfortunate that this movie got leaked and millions downloaded it. Mainly because I like some of the action stars in this, minus the new recruits. But I thought it was at least somewhat watchable to a certain degree. It's not a flick I would see again, but it's watchable for one sit through. The action sequences didn't bring anything new or eye popping either. Maybe it was time for the veterans to call it quits after this last ride.3.9/10",The Expendables 3
27,OllieSuave-007,They are indispensable!,8,18 August 2014,"The Expendables 3 continues the crazy action, a story where Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) and his Expendables team, now join by some newbies, go on a mission to defeat renegade Expendables co-founder Conrad Stonebanks (Mel Gibson) and his arms-trading scheme. It's a movie with an adrenaline-rush and a no-nonsense plot, mixing in with a good dose of drama and laugh-out-loud humor. Like its prequels, this movie is not meant to be a masterpiece, but is a great film to see the many action legends together (Stallone, Statham, Ford, Lundgren, Scharzenegger, Snipes, Gibson, Banderas and Li), which gives the notion that these old time stars still have what it takes to make an action-packed and thrilling adventure movie. There are plenty of weaponry and martial-arts action, wild special/visual effects and a fast-paced plot that keep this film an edge-of-your seat experience. The humor is out-of-this world, especially that of the blabbering Banderas and Snipes poking fun at his own real-life arrest when on screen. A few downsides to this film, I think, are that the ultimate battle came as a little rushed and Jet Li's appearances were scarce and his martial arts moves were absent. I also don't think this film is as suspenseful as the previous movie but, overall, it's still an entertaining flick that sent the audience in the movie theater roaring with laughter.

28,Hellmant,A lot more subtle and less ridiculous.,9,20 August 2014,"'THE EXPENDABLES 3': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five) The third entry in the all-star action series about a team of mercenaries hired to do the CIA's dirty work. This time the Expendables must take on a dangerous arms dealer, who also co-founded their team. The film once again stars Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture, Terry Crews, Jet Li and Arnold Schwarzenegger. They're joined, in this sequel, by Mel Gibson, Wesley Snipes, Antonio Banderas, Kellan Lutz, Ronda Rousey, Glen Powell, Victor Ortiz, Kelsey Grammar and Harrison Ford (replacing Bruce Willis, who wanted more money). It was once again written by Stallone, as well as Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt (Rothenberger and Benedikt previously wrote the 2013 action flick 'OLYMPUS HAS FALLEN'). This chapter was directed by rookie filmmaker Patrick Hughes (who previously directed the 2010 thriller 'RED HILL'). I found it to be a definite improvement over it's 2012 predecessor but still not as classic as the original.The movie opens with Barney Ross (Stallone), and his team, breaking a former Expendables member, Doctor Death (Snipes), out of a military prison. They then enlist the doctor's help in stopping a dangerous arms deal, to a Somalian warlord. Ross is shocked to learn that the arms dealer they're intercepting is his former partner, and co-founder of the Expendables, Conrad Stonebanks (Gibson); who Barney thought he had killed years earlier. Stonebanks gets away, after severely wounding one of Barney's men (Crews), and Ross then makes it his mission to stop him. Instead of endangering even more of his aging team Barney decides to enlist new and younger recruits. He also now takes orders from a new CIA boss, Max Drummer (Ford), who replaced Church (Bruce Willis in the previous two films).The movie is the first film in the series to be released with a PG-13 rating, which was severely disappointing news to fans of the franchise. For me the tamer rating kind of makes it like watching an 80's action flick edited for TV. It would have been better bloodier, with a more fitting R rating, but this didn't ruin the movie for me; it's still a heck of a lot of fun (although I'm still looking forward to an R rated version on Blu-ray). There's also been a lot of publicity about the film leaking to torrent sites (in DVD quality) nearly 3 weeks before it's domestic theatrical release date. This is sad because it definitely hurt the film's box office; 2.2 million people downloaded the movie in the first week (that's a potential $16 to $22 million loss). So of course the film underperformed in theaters; which could mean less money invested in future installments (and therefore lesser quality movies as a result) but I'll still go see them (supposedly Pierce Brosnan, Hulk Hogan and Jackie Chan are already in negotiations for the next installment). I love these films; they're some of my favorite action movies and this chapter didn't disappoint (despite it's PG-13 rating). Some of the younger cast is pretty bad (Lutz and Rousey definitely can't act) and it's sad to see some former regulars (like Li and Crews) reduced to extended cameos. The addition of new veteran action stars (like Snipes, Ford and Banderas) is definitely a bonus though and Gibson steals the show (he's a little too talented for a film like this, which makes it even more fun to watch). It's nice to see Lundgren as a silent but deadly badass again (as opposed to the goofy comic relief character he became in the second film) and of course action Gods like Stallone and Schwarzenegger are once again amazingly awesome to watch too. I think the first movie was the best; because it was a fresh novelty idea, at the time, and Stallone directed it (he's a much better director than Simon West or Patrick Hughes are). The second movie was a little too campy and more tongue-in-cheek; so it wasn't quite as an effective action thrill ride. Despite the lack of gore this third movie is a slight return to form for the franchise. The jokes are still there but they're a lot more subtle and less ridiculous. You'll also never see another American franchise with more celebrities that can't pronounce so many common, everyday, English words (despite the fact that English is the native language for most of them). Fans definitely shouldn't be disappointed.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/Ie33IbZzmi0",The Expendables 3
29,thesar-2,Expendables 13,3,16 August 2014,"Spoiler alert! The Scooby Gang, or as they refer to themselves as: the ""Expendables,"" spend what feels like twenty meaningless minutes inside a pub towards the end. It was irrelevant, boring, dragging and made me comment to my movie buddy that I was expecting the end credits to show the inevitable After-Bar-Denny's trip and extend out the overly long movie even further.Yeah, I'm starting at the end of The Expendables 3, but that should give you a taste for what you are in for. The first two films were R-Rated and here, they the cut back the MPAA to PG-13 and yet, increased the running time 23 minutes more than both the first two. Even without that additional time, the movie was clearly 40 minutes too long.Please, someone fire that editor. Scenes were overly long – including many that just show the reaction shot of a character for at least 10-15 seconds when it was neither funny nor normal, additional plot points were introduced and neither explored or returned to and despite the franchise norm of adding as many iconic action/adventure heroes from past and present, there were far too many characters and actors that were completely irrelevant and mostly obnoxious. Antonio Banderas played the most annoying character in the series history and could've easily been cut.Basically, it's the same old ""I'm getting too old for this sh|t"" storyline – which, oddly, is never spoken in a movie featuring Mel Gibson and after the last movie full of Action Hero catchphrases. Sylvester Stallone plays leader Barney of a D-Team of mercenaries and spends most of the movie running around in circles while trying to protect his friends from death and leading young, able bodies into certain death. His loyalty is admirable until his questionable actions for the up and coming HUMAN BEINGS he cares little about isnever explored.Barney repeatedly ditches the best men for the job of eliminating the one bright spot of the film: Gibson's Stonebanks, and repeats the Ocean's Trilogy search for a (truly) Expendable crew and for an obscene amount of footage with Kelsey Grammar. How he's labeled as an ""Action Hero from Days Past"" is beyond me. My suggestion half-way through this was: Where's Danny Glover? I understand Jackie Chan refuses to be in the film series, but why not pair up Glover with the returning (and sadly, disgraced) Mel Gibson? Especially when the, again, ""Getting too old for this sh|t"" plot is relevant.Admittedly, some of the action works with the exception of the never- ending clichés of bad guys who are easily disposed of while the good guys are rarely scratched. In addition, SOME one-liners work and I'm being very generous there. (85% ARE NOT humorous and most fall flat.) And the countless cameos and appearances – an Expendables staple – are okay, but if this movie is any indication, Episode VII's Han Solo is gonna look as old as Yoda did when he passed in Episode VI.Sure, the humor, action, guns and kick-ass-action are supposed to be an homage to 80s Giants, but some of it gets a little more silly than I remembered it. For example, Good-Guy has chance to kill Bad-Guy (he's in a helicopter above the Expendables) and yet after the 1,516 rounds of ammo they fired off, they ceased fire on him – THEIR TARGET. Also, Good- Guy lets Bad-Guy explain whole plot to the freshmen Expendables and even lets him live in an obvious rip-off of the Mission: Impossible series. Further, a ton of time is spend on a third-rate character we barely even know, who was shot, hospitalized and we are supposed to care. I had to ask my friend, repeatedly, which one was he again? And finally, Bad-Guy not only can hear all of what that the Good-Guys are planning, he literally gives them 45 seconds to survive when he could've killed them on second one. He even complains and kills another later because he's so mad that, I guess, he dropped the ball?I didn't like the aimless and choppy first installment. That said, I gave the second one a chance, and loved it almost 10x more. It had more direction, plot, straightforwardness and perfectly aligned camp to make it passable. Kinda like what Piranha 3D was going for and was successful at. True, I didn't have high expectations for part 3, but I didn't expect a ton of wasted time on screen and so much talent dismissed. I mean, Jason Statham is one of my all-time favorites and he's just reduced to almost nothing on screen. And don't get me started on what they did to Jet Li. They didn't just waste him; they shortened his role to, ah-hem, ""short jokes.""Nope. This movie gets no recommendation even though it's definitely not the worst movie or action movie I've seen recently. It just doesn't work and is the overkill most Part 3s are.* * *Final thoughts: At very least, my movie-buddy and I had a blast while mocking this movie in the theatre. We kept air high-fiving each other because the characters – the, um, BIG, BUFF, BUTCH, ACTION HEROES – were acting like children when a tense situation was resolved. You'll hear them cheer their teammates on like they were on a Saved by the Bell episode. Despite the many curse words, I understand they were trying to tone it down to a PG-13, but in a ton of scenes – mostly in the last act – they all-but made it G-Rated. Finally, some entertainment: I couldn't help but laugh hard at the movie in the finale.",The Expendables 3
30,Robert_duder,The boys are back...well sort of,7,23 August 2014,"If you are a fan of my reviews (first of all thanks) and second of all you know I have some sort of bizarre fascination with Sylvester Stallone. When I first became a film buff, I fell in love with the insane action films of the 80's and 90's and that mean my heroes were and always have been Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Harrison Ford, Bruce Willis, Clint Eastwood to name a few. So when The Expendables first came out I felt like it was a dream come true and for me The Expendables 1 and 2 were exactly that...a dream come true. So by the time The Expendables 3 rolled around it was instantly one of my most anticipated films of the year. So it had a lot to live up to. But even with my expectations aside they weren't ready to make this. They lost sight of what fans like me loved about this series. We liked the old school feel, the excessive violent mind-numbing action and the cheeky and ridiculous fan service one liners and watching the more senior members of the cast blow things up and interact for the first time. The Expendables 3 is a completely different film in a number of ways. It has a darker tone, far less ""in jokes"" and comedy in general and nearly the entire Expendables crew take a back seat for one reason or another and they try to bring in this new hot young cast that for all purposes are terrible.Its true that it takes a lot for me to say something bad about Sylvester Stallone and I won't start now. If you're a fan of his then you know what to expect (though I really do think he's more talented than what he's given credit for.) He knows what his fans love and you'll see plenty of it in The Expendables 3. He runs, he guns, he cries out, he mumbles and shows authority and emotion. He's the Barney Ross we've all come to know and love. Our old favourites Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture and Terry Crews take a back seat and are reduced to a handful of scenes as almost supporting characters. Crews is nearly immediately removed from the team and is hardly even a cameo much like Jet Li in the second film and again in this one. I was never a huge fan of Couture and Crews as part of the team and yet I missed them both in this one and really missed Statham and Lundgren and the chemistry between them all. Wesley Snipes was a great addition to the cast finally but I felt like his character was left very underdeveloped and lacking real depth that was just barely there. Its always great seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger and Sly Stallone together but Schwarzenegger is reduced to a very small role again but still has some solid scenes that made me excited. Kelsey Grammar surprised me by being an excellent addition to the cast and I really wanted to know more about his character but we don't spend a lot of time on him. He was still really good and him and Stallone were great together. Harrison Ford couldn't possibly be a bad addition. The man is a legend. I was practically giddy seeing him in scenes with Schwarzenegger and then Stallone. His character is really the exact same as Bruce Willis' Church but he throws out a ton of really awful and cheesy one-liners so he was sort of forced into the story but he's still a welcomed addition. The young blood that Stallone brings on board consists of Glen Powell, Victor Ortiz, Ronda Rousey and Kellan Lutz and I'm sorry to them but they are god awful. They literally ruin the scenes they are in and they are completely unnecessary to this film. Rousey is excruciating watching her ""act."" Last but not least I thought Antonio Banderas was awesome in the film. It was great seeing him and Stallone together again (Assassins was their first film) and he is funny and quick witted and just easily the most fun character in the movie. And then we have the monstrous Stonebanks played perfectly by Mel Gibson. What an amazingly wicked villain and he really does it just by stature, voice, and presence. I missed him on screen!! His battle with Stallone at the end was achingly short...a definite negative BUT the battle itself was amazing to watch.The cast has some ups and downs but if Stallone couldn't put together the main cast then they should have waited or skipped this entirely. You will miss the original cast especially when the new young cast is so bad. The plot feels rushed at times and like they had to make numerous changes in order to accommodate cast changes. I think their biggest faux pas was that they changed who their demographic is. They are deliberately trying to appeal to the young generation instead of their old faithful fans like me. The absolutely awful looking green screen scenes (Ford's Chopper scenes and other action moments) really hurt the quality of the film. Now that I've trashed it, please know that I didn't hate the movie. I could never. There were a handful of really good scenes that made this fun, watchable and one I will watch again and again. The climactic scene in the abandoned building was excellent as was the opening prison break scene. Despite many critics trashing the line, I loved hearing Arnold yell ""Get to the chopppahhh"" at least twice. Sadly, this is likely the end for The Expendables but if you're a die hard fan like myself you will enjoy it but be prepared for a big step down from the previous two films. 7.5/10",The Expendables 3
31,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Plodding, sanitized third instalment",4,21 August 2014,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningBarney and his team are back, and this time they have been assigned to take care of the villainous Stonebanks (Mel Gibson), despicable arms dealer and former co founder of Barney's elite unit. The gang track him down to Somalia, where one of Barney's team suffers some serious injuries. Discontented with this turn of events, he assesses that he and his team are ready for the knackers yard and sets out trying to recruit some young blood to form a new team. Meanwhile, Stonebanks is plotting his most diabolical scheme yet.Possessing more intelligence than his grizilled, one note delivery might suggest, Sly Stallone must know when he's on to a good thing and has spotted a winning formula in these Expendables films, where he re-unites all his action cohorts from their 80's heyday and thrown in some more contemporary names for good measure, and put them all together to deliver a massive bout of the no brainer, shoot em up action feasts that the fans know and love. Sly's self assured approach must have spread to his regulars and those who've heard from word of mouth by now, as everyone could see from the poster side of the publicity campaign, with the big, grinning faces on everyone involved, giving off the impression of everyone being a bit too pleased with themselves.This time, the boat has really been pushed up, with inevitability Wesley Snipes making his first appearance amongst the regulars, as well as really big name guys like Harrison Ford and Gibson, of course, as the villain. There's no reason Chuck Norris couldn't have made a re- appearance, though his poorly written role in the last instalment didn't maybe set the right pedestal. However, with a cast list that barely fits on the poster, you're left with the feeling Sly set his sights that bit too high, and as such the cast is equally topped up with a selection of up-coming, little heard of stars. Herein lies the problem, that he spends too much time rounding these up and travelling about to find them and not enough time on the explosive action, two really big things that will put the main target audience off.Other than that, it's business as usual, with mindless stunts, explosions and action galore, only for the film to fall victim to it's own success again, with a more sanitized, family friendly 12A rating, hoping to draw in the younger crowd now that the series has attained a cult following and has a big established fan base. The big problem here, from the cast to the writing, is that the success of the franchise has made it lazy and too pleased with itself, relying too much on a big fancy cast list and what went before, without really giving us a film that has much meat and bones on itself. If the first one only got two stars, this certainly isn't getting any more than that. **",The Expendables 3
32,bowmanblue,Fun... mostly,7,9 December 2014,"If you're thinking of watching 'The Expendables 3,' then 'part 3' is a kind of odd place to start any franchise. Therefore, I would generally recommend starting with part 1 and going from there. However, in case you're in any wonder as to what it's all about, it's basically an ensemble cast (led by Sly Stallone) of all the biggest (and best?) action stars of the eighties (plus Jason Statham thrown in for good measure).What you have is a bunch of old men who really should be playing golf and yet we suspend our disbelief long enough to believe that they can really run, jump, punch and generally take on wave after wave of insignificant bad guys without so much as getting shot. So, if you generally like (or can at least remember) some of these faces from yesteryear and the epic on-screen battles they fought then you'll probably enjoy the nostalgia trip which this film basically is. It never takes itself seriously, so don't expect anything dark and moody, just fun.The first Expendables outing was definitely fun. And, for the record, I enjoyed part 2 even more. Therefore, I was really expecting to LOVE the third instalment. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it, but there was one thing I didn't approve of. Namely the fact to interject some 'fresh blood' into Sly's team. Basically, it wasn't necessary. Sly chooses youngsters over the established faces who we actually care about. Therefore, we don't really know them as well as the older action stars and these youngsters take up a reasonable proportion of the first third of the film. Then they end up getting captured and the old team has to be assembled to get them back. Basically, they could have left out the whole 'youngsters subplot' and got on with our aging heroes hunting down rogue expendable baddie, played by Mel Gibson.I think if I was going to watch this again (and I probably will!), I'll skip the first third with the 'kids' and go straight on to the rescue mission. Plus I thought there was too much CGI explosions for my liking – but I'm no fan of computer added trickery, unless it's really seamlessly intertwined with the film. Half the time you could tell the explosions were added post production.Anyway, if you like the first two films, or any of the stars, you should get something out of this. Just don't be too misled by the advertising posters – not all the stars featured play a major part. Some are only in the film for literally a few minutes.",The Expendables 3
33,ThomasDrufke,"""I can do that"" - Well Evidently This Franchise Cant",5,28 December 2014,"Sometimes a franchise never truly needs a refreshing way to tell a story. Look at the Bond films. They are still spy action films just with a different actor every once in awhile. But then there are franchises such as Fast and Furious that were growing tiresome for fans. They desperately needed a solid film or the franchise would have likely fell apart. They completely revamped the way the movies are told and now it's one of the most profitable series of films out today. The Expendables tried to reach a wider audience by making this film PG-13 and recruiting young ""talent"" to join the crew. But boy did that ever fail.The reason why these movies are so fun is because of the near washed up actors all joining forces to create a wild and ridiculous throwback 80's action style film. But when you take away some of the language and violence and mix it with young so called actors who nobody really cares for, it tends to fall apart. First of all I don't think the rating is why the film failed. In fact I think they get their fair share of swears in. The body count is still incredibly high but the blood is definitely limited. I still really enjoy watching all of these action legends on screen together. Arnold's one liners can be a bit too much at times, especially when you directly quote one of his most famous Predator lines, but the bickering between the group is still so entertaining that I cant help but want more of these films.With that being said this film is pretty much a train wreck. It tries to pull on our heart strings one too many times in a film that is supposed to be goofy and nonsensical. I also don't understand the logic of trying to recruit these inexperienced young crew into a job that is probably harder than anything the previous crew had done. Gibson is a great villain, but even he couldn't save some of the stupid moments this film had to offer. It's also a good 25 minutes longer than the previous films. There's only so many ridiculous action stunts I can accept. It's not a good film at all but I have to admit I want to see another film in the series in a few years.+Love the old crew all together +Snipes and Banderas are solid additions -New young faces fall flat -Too long -Tried to reach a wider audience 5.3/10",The Expendables 3

Even the action sequences are too drawn-out and too choppy. But Gibson makes a fantastic villain and he was grossly underutilized so they could make more time for Sylvester Stallone's mumbling monologuing.

It's not as enjoyable as the first two Expendables and I think that is mainly because of the age rating,this being 12A while the other two were 15A and 16. It simply wasn't as fun when they gave it a rating so younger kids could watch it, because we didn't get to see these huge action stars use some intense violence and vulgar language, which is the main reason the first two are so much fun, and it definitely made for an underwhelming experience. There is no denying that this cast is stellar, with huge action stars such as Sylvester Stallone, Arnold Schawarzenegger, Harrison Ford and Mel Gibson, who steals the show as the main villain, I really hope they can get a cast as good as this back for a fourth movie, with an R rating this time to keep the movies usual age group happy. It's not as good as the first two and it is certainly disappointing, but I would still recommend Expendables 3 to anyone looking for a good action or adventure if you ever see it on television.

I don't know what. Could be a studio guy whispered in Sly's ear, you know, Big Guy, with Cruise's MI franchise still wobbly, and his Jack Reacher franchise DOA, and the FF franchise gone mainstream, there is really no one doing ""caper"" movies any more... make a few changes and you could pull in some serious numbers.No one ever said that Sly is a one-trick pony.

I remember I saw them but don't really remember too much about them. I sat down to watch this expecting more of the same. While I can't tell you this is anything other than what you are expecting, I did think this was the best and most fun of the three. This one was non-stop action like the others but seemed to have more comedy. There were a ton of ""in"" jokes in this which made the comedy work that much more. Harrison Ford talking about why Bruce Willis isn't there, Arnold saying ""Get to the Choppa"" were just a few of the great ones. All that said the movie is pretty much review proof. If you have seen the others no matter what someone says you will watch this one as well. If you haven't seen the others then you probably won't have a desire to watch this one either. I did have a little problem with the effects in this though. For a movie this big with a budget this high I really thought they could afford practical explosions rather than the cheesy CGI that was used. I'm not sure if that was a conscious choice to fit with the cheesiness of the movie or if that was what they chose stylistically. Either way it didn't work.

42,tabuno,An Entertaining Shoot-Em Up Movie,8,16 January 2019,"16 August 2014. Sylvester Stallone has matured over the years and this movie offers up both a more nuanced performance combining both a lot of action along with some drama as well as the attempt at the transitioning from old to new and back to old again. It's sort of a redemption movie for the senior citizen (those over 50). I don't believe that this movie will be a great sell for those under 25 or if they do, that they will recommend it to their friends. This movie is somewhat like Sean Connery's performance in his last return as James Bond in Never Say Never Again (1983).Expendables 3 has some great wry references to getting old, and a surprise Spanish actor's comic performance against type that actually works. What doesn't quite gel is the interaction and balanced portrayal of old and new team members and there seems to be two too many characters on the good team to offer the more exciting details and character development to allow each actor their due. However, overall, this movie was very entertaining, with good pacing, and a nicely developed script that continues on and the movie does a decent attempt to offer the older actors some screen time rather than embarrassing cameos. The climax however wasn't the most original nor convincing nor do I expect another sequel unless this movie makes millions and millions.I did get my money's worth and a pleasant experience with many of our well known aging male action stars - that was this movies delightful sweet moments.",The Expendables 3
43,Platypuschow,"The Expendables 3: I stand corrected, a bit",6,22 May 2018,"Okay fine The Expendables franchise isn't a complete failure in my eyes, this is by far the best one and three movies in shows potential.First of all I want to address a point. I've long since complained about the state of a world where it's highest paid people are actors, singers and sports people. Though I'm a movie obsessive I'll never deny that they are offensively overpaid and Expendables 3 demonstrates that with the absence of Bruce Willis. They tried to get him back in a small capacity, just 4 days work and offered him 3 million. 3 million dollars for 4 days work! In response, he demanded 4 million and they decided to cut him loose. So think about this, a man being paid more for a days work than a minimum wage worker is likely to make in their entire life! That ladies and gentlemen is the world we live in.Anyway I digress.I wouldn't go as far as to say that The Expendables 3 entertained me but it certainly had its moments. The action was marginally better than the previous two films but it's saving grace was the cast. No I'm not talking about the same guys who have been phoning it in for the past two movies, I mean the newbies.
Antonio Banderas stole the movie, he was brilliant. Snipes delivered like I haven't seen him do so in years and despite all the criticism I think Rousey did a great job as well.So fine, it's not the big action blockbuster to end all action blockbusters but it blows the previous two movies out of the water. With a great villian, the new cast and a good lengthy finale it's passable stuff.The Good:As much as it pains me to say, Mel GibsonAntonio Banderas & Ronda RouseyThe Bad:Robert Davi was wastedStill mindless cliched stuffThings I Learnt From This Movie:Every person on the planet without any formal training can wield any type of firearm like a professionalThe moment Gibson was outed as a bigot, he started doing bad guy roles and nailed it every timeI genuinely want to know if it's possible to attain/maintain a physique like Stallones without steroidsCountless explosive shells fired from tanks at a building rigged with explosives won't set them offDisguising yourself as a bad guy complete with helmet without your allies knowing you're doing it in a full assault situation makes perfect sense",The Expendables 3
44,slightlymad22,"Needs to be seen on the big screen, but the bluray release will be a better movie",6,14 August 2014,"Continuing my plan to watch every Sly movie in order, I come to Expendables 3.Plot In A Paragraph: Barney Ross (Sly) disbands The Expendables and signs up some new blood to take down arms dealer Conrad Stonebanks (Mel Gibson) Expendables 3 is certainly action packed and while there is plenty hand to hand knockabout and a lot of people die, but they either quickly fall bloodlessly, or it's all off screen (a lot of quick cut aways) with a PG13 rating there is no viewing of the actual carnage. For me Snipes owned the beginning of the movie, (but then seemed to have been forgotten about the rest of the movie) Grammar kept things moving a long nicely during the recruiting section. Then Banderas walks away with the movie in the final third. If the character of Doc (Snipes) had been more carefully scripted, and given more screen time in the second half of the pic, he would have easily stolen the picture.Sly has shown before he can be a fine dramatic actor when allowed to escape his action hero confines, however here Gibson steals the scenes he shared with him. His hairline is distracting again (especially when he meets Ford for the first time) at times, as is his wardrobe. He seems to change clothes every scene. In fact he actually looks younger in this movie, than he did in the first.A big problem for me with this one is, Sly's Barney Ross is suddenly invincible!! the old man who ""just got my ass kicked"" in the first movie is long gone. No longer are The Expendables a team, who are there for each other (the first movie is the most ensemble of the three) it's a Barney Ross led gang. And he is fine with doing things on his own. For his brief time on screen Ford brings style to the proceedings and simply radiates presence. Gibson is under used (in the first half) But he owns the scene with Sly in a Van midway through. It is the stand out scene of the movie (the only one with any intensity, and an example of how good an expendables movie can be) and a reminder of how good Gibson is. He is easily the best villain to grace the franchise. That scene in the van is possibly the best acted scene in the franchise.Jason Statham has less to do in this movie than the other movies, but he gives his usual fine performance as Christmas. Jet Li once again is sadly nothing more than a cameo. Lundgren's Gunner seemed to be slipping back to the unbalanced guy from the first movie, and Couture just seems happy to be there!!Of the young guns, Ortiz and Powell are bland and uninteresting, Kellan Lutz is at least annoying with his lack of respect for Barney, whilst Rhonda Rousey (My god is she hot) is OKThere is an Expendables movie so of course there is a fiery climax, which unfortunately involves some Awful CGI explosions. If Superman IV should have thought film makers anything, it is 'if you have bad special effects, don't reuse them over and over again!!' There are less jokey references to the stars previous roles than in Expendables 2, and it is much effective than the infinite amount in Ex2. It is longer than other two movies, so it gives a bit more time to know the characters, Sadly it wasted on the likes of Ortiz and Lutz, who are both a waste of screen time. The fight between Sly & Gibson is too short (About same as Sly and JCVD in Ex2) and is predictable. The climax is also more than slightly ridiculous. As I said earlier, Gibson is the best villain to grace an Expendables movie, one you felt could hurt the Expendables, and it is was saddening to see him dispatched so effortlessly and singlehandedly by Sly. I'd have rather Gibson got the better of Sly in a brutal fight, with both of them giving every ounce they had (as Rambo and Riggs would have done) before Sly won, or even better if Jet Li (ala Lethal Weapon 4) helped Sly fight him. The core audience of this franchise don't care about the new younger people that were added to the cast, and they also don't want to see a PG-13 movie with them in, whilst younger cinema goers don't care about an Expendables movie.I think if we got an R rated DVD, it may be a bit better thought of, but the lame new recruits would still be a waste of screen time, the fight would still be the same and again all of the Expendables would live. Another Expendables movie that continues the trend of the previous two movies, some good parts, some not so good parts, an overall feeling of a missed opportunity, but still OK.Hampered by the rating, which angered some/most fans, and the HD screener leak, Expendables 3 limped to $39 million at the domestic box office, and ended the year, the 80th Highest Grossing Movie of 2014.",The Expendables 3
45,tomgillespie2002,Bloated money-maker that isolates it's original target audience,3,10 August 2014,"The first two Expendables movies, though no-one would label them the next Citizen Kane, were enjoyable for what they were - daft, funny 80's throwbacks where grizzled and saggy has-been's re-lived their glory days, when a cold-blooded murder would always be rounded up by amusing quip. Sylvester Stallone put together a huge ensemble of recognisable faces; some veterans of action cinema, some relatively new to the game, and managed to wet the pants of many middle-aged action junkies by reuniting the founders of Planet Hollywood.But they were fun and nostalgic because they were aware of how silly they were, wise enough not to take itself too seriously. The third instalment of the surprisingly continuing franchise - The Expendables 4 is set for the green light - has made the decision that macho posturing and homoerotic banter is simply not enough, and we must now somehow care for these characters and take them seriously. The trouble is, no matter how lovable some of these actors are (or were), their characters are such one-dimensional meat-heads that, apart from physically, it's hard to even tell them apart, let alone give a damn for their safety.After the successful rescue of former Expendable Doctor Death (Wesley Snipes), the lug-head crew go straight onto their next mission to take down some warlord or other, only for the groups leader, Barney Ross (Stallone), to recognise the man as Expendable co-founder and long- thought-dead Conrad Stonebanks (Mel Gibson). Stonebanks seemingly went dark years ago, and after he seriously wounds Caesar (Terry Crews), Ross wants revenge. Not wanting to be responsible for the deaths of his friends, Ross turns his back on the Expendables and, with the help of assassin estate agent Bonaparte (Kelsey Grammar), rounds up an all-new (and young) gang of eager mercenaries to take down the man he once called a friend.The franchise has been growing ever more child-friendly since is started. In the UK, the first movie was an 18 certificate, the second was a 15, and this, a 12A. It's hard to figure out just who this movie is aimed at. Sure, kids with short attention spans will probably enjoy the wobbly-cammed action scenes, but the series' long-term fans, the middle-aged nostalgics, will be scratching their heads at the lack of blood and soft dialogue. It also spends far too much time focusing on Ross rounding up his new gang of indistinguishable and astonishingly dull youngsters. Only Galgo (Antonio Banderas) sticks out, and even his motor-mouthed comedy routine soon gets annoying.Of the old-hand newcomers, Harrison Ford - replacing Bruce Willis when the latter got greedy, leading to one of the films best lines - is suitably game, but Wesley Snipes' characters is lazily written and is no more than a carbon copy of Jason Statham's Christmas (he's 'good with knives'). However, Mel Gibson, who seems to operating under the idea that if the audience is going to hate him anyway, he may as well have fun with it, is the best thing in the entire film. For such little screen time and lack of complexity, he is undeniably creepy, and director Patrick Hughes has missed a trick spending so much time away from him.The Expendables 3 is crushingly bad. Even haters of the first, and best, film can surely appreciate it's pumped-up, old-school charm. Two films later, and the series is a bloated, confused money-maker, isolating it's original target audience and seems under the impression that as long as there's an explosion here and a cornball line there, that it can be forgiven for sheer bad writing and film student execution. Maybe it is time for Stallone, Lundgren, Schwarzenegger et al to hang up their boots and war paint and make way for the next generation. But if the charisma- free block-heads whom Stallone finds (it seems that if you can pummel a man's face in, then espionage and machine-gun operation comes naturally) are anything to go by, then maybe it's time for the entire straight-to- DVD genre to finally call it a day.",The Expendables 3
46,zkonedog,"You Have To ""Get It"" In Order To ""Get It""",7,1 March 2017,"When examining a movie like ""Expendables 3"", one would do well to establish the ""ground rules"" first, so to speak. This franchise is not meant to be 100% serious. It is a throwback to the action stars and action movies of the 1980s, to be sure, but the tongue is always firmly planted in cheek. That being said, creator Sylvester Stallone takes these films just as seriously (in terms of trying to make them quality undertakings) as anything he has ever done. But, as my title of this review states, you have to ""get it"" in order to ""get it""!For a basic plot summary, ""Expendables 3"" sees the ""old gang"" of Stallone, Statham, Lundgren, Couture, and Crews still wreaking havoc on bad guys...at least in the beginning. After a mission involving the new baddie (Mel Gibson) goes awry, Stallone's character decides it is time to put the others out to pasture, recruiting a new crew consisting of Ronda Rousey, Kellan Lutz, Victor Ortiz, and Antonio Banderas. Along the way, they also pick up some help from Harrison Ford, Kelsey Grammar, Wesley Snipes, and Arnold Schwarzenegger.There are two primary reasons to watch the films in this franchise: 1. For the action; 2. For the comedy/camaraderie. The first part was really heavy on the action, while EX2 was pretty much all wise-cracking comedy. EX3, however, is easily the best made film of the series, featuring the best mix of everything. Though my personal favorite may still be part two (because I love the wise-cracking comedy a bit more than the guns a-blazin'), the film-evaluator portion of me realizes that this is the best overall effort so far.Of course, any Expendables film after the first one is going to be judged on the ""new blood"", and in that aspect EX3 comes through with flying colors. There are a few characters (Lutz, Ortiz) who just kind of fall flat, but otherwise all the other new additions are great. Banderas' frantic comedy nearly steals the show, while Ford, Grammar, and Snipes are perfect for this franchise (old guys getting a chance to mix it up again!). And Ronda Rousey?! Hoo-boy!!All the reviews circulating about EX3 seem to be overwhelmingly negative, but I can understand why, to an extent: if you can't see this type of film-making for what it is, you won't like the movie...simple as that. To be honest, these action-heavy flicks aren't necessarily my cup of tea either, but I can appreciate the diverse cast and the intent of what is trying to be done.Simply put, I was very entertained by this film in the theater (something I can't say for many of the films I've seen recently). While each Expendables movie offers something a little different (and thus will have differing levels of ""favorite-ism"" among fans), it was clear to me that this was the best-made of the bunch with its ability to have a good mix of humor and action spread out through the film.",The Expendables 3
47,Floated2,Not as good as its predecessors,6,27 September 2015,"Full fill upon it's own course, the superabundance of muscle is the USP of the Expendables series, which centers on a veteran group of mercenaries employed to do the CIA's dirty work. Bruce Willis is missing from this outing but Arnold Schwarzenegger is hanging in there, while we also have Harrison Ford, Mel Gibson, plus a whole new generation of die-cast Expendables action figures to play with. The essential format is the same: spray a lot of Eighties-era weaponry around photogenic trouble spots, reflect on what a drag it is getting old and make out like what America needs right now is more guns, more explosives and more muscle.Open with semi-coherent Stallone, likable Statham, Dolph Lundgren and the entirely superfluous Randy Couture, an enjoyably volatile Snipes from a prison train in the former Soviet Union. Snipes shaves, with no foam or anything, using an enormous bowie knife. Typical predictable ending with unfortunately no surprises.",The Expendables 3
48,eddie_baggins,"Third time is not a charm, a dagger to the heart of the franchise",3,14 August 2014,"Like any joke that was once funny or warmly received but slowly became worn out and intrusive the more you heard/said it, the third entry into the Expendables franchise has now sadly become nothing more than a tired, tame and predictable action flick with not an ounce of charm or wit and becomes a quite arduous 2 hour experience thanks to its lacklustre performances and irksome direction by Australian Patrick Hughes. Without question everyone here looks bored and subsequently you will be bored as well.With the Expendables previous entries it's not like the first two films were standout examples of the action genre, but the first film had a real novelty value and a sense of humour to boot while the 2nd film actually became a hugely enjoyable guilty pleasure with a care free attitude. This 3rd film completely fails to justify a reason for being as its shown visibly by most involved that they couldn't care less if they tried. Boasting additions to the cast including recently freed from prison Wesley Snipes, crazed drunkard Mel Gibson, fast talking Puss in Boots himself Antonio Banderas and cash strapped from divorce proceedings Kelsey Grammar, not to mention a raft of other bit players that really didn't need to be there, The Expendables 3 tries to jam pack proceedings with novelty factors and overcome a bored looking returning cast but fails at what previous entries did which was remain entertaining.The story within this tale is so utterly pointless it's hard to see how it was stretched to 2 hours but somehow the setup of the Expendables going after ex member and now bad man Stonebanks played by the increasingly bland Gibson is not enough to warrant the running time. There are slight moments that work throughout here such as a few nice action set pieces staged sadly far too early then far too late and a few cheap one liners get a chuckle or two ""I'm the knife before Christmas"" but with a focus on too much Stallone and his new young recruits and not enough of the stars we are promised in the trailer, this seems like nothing more than a direct to DVD affair and whenever the focus turns to the screenplay things get hideously bad. It's a shame that director Hughes (director of the upcoming American Raid remake, have mercy on our poor souls!) who showed potential with his Australian debut Red Hill can't enliven proceedings more but it's unquestionable that the film lacks a huge sense of pizazz or sense of occasion from both behind the camera and in front of it.One thinks that after this effort this against all odds trilogy has lived it's last day and if by chance they make the rounds again, results may be well and truly beyond a joke as this one barely survives becoming an out and out fail thanks to its overall sense of complacency and ability to play to the rulebook at every given moment.

49,leonblackwood,Tetestorone pumped action! 5/10,5,13 December 2014,"Review: This movie didn't seem that much different than the other films in this franchise. OK, the team of Expendables are much bigger now that Sly has recruited some young blood, but I didn't think that the new team had much screen charisma or great skill, except for Antonio Banderas and Ronda Rousey who plays the woman in the team. The basic goodies vs. baddies concept, with Mel Gibson playing the baddie after he has become a arms dealer from previously being in the Expendables and Sly being the goodie, as usual, is quite played out now. Some of the script was a bit corny like when Arnie kept on saying ""Chopper"" in all of his lines and Wesley mentioning his tax problems but it did show a lighter side to these testosterone pumped action heroes. As usual, it's all about the action, which seemed a bit over exaggerated in places but it's what you have to expect from this franchise. I missed the banter between Jet Li and Dolph Lundgren and you don't really get to see an in depth side to any of the characters. Apart from that, there's enough action to entertain an audience but don't expect a clever storyline. Average!Round-Up: It's obvious that people are still interested in watching the Retirebles kick butt, judging by the box office takings, so I'm sure that people are wondering what new characters they can bring into a 4th movie. Banderas, who played an annoying Expendable because he wouldn't stop talking, was a weird choice for this type of role but he did add some wit to the group. I would have liked to see more from Terry Crews, who played Caesar, and I'm surprised that Sly didn't show Jet Li using his martial arts skills. It also seemed a bit unrealistic because the whole group came out of the big showdown, without a scratch and the helicopter scene at the end was way over the top. Although the elder stars are getting on a bit, they still are a joy to watch and it's good to see them all together in one film. After all of the bad press that Mel Gibson has been getting, he has proved that he is still a top actor but I doubt that this movie will bring him back into the spotlight. The same goes for Wesley Snipes and Dolph Lundgren whose movies go straight to DVD nowadays. Budget: $90million Worldwide Gross: $206millionI recommend this movie to people who are into this Expendable franchise about a group of army veterans, fighting against evil doers. 5/10",The Expendables 3
50,TheMovieDiorama,The Expendables 3 is the most expendable entry of the series.,4,31 March 2018,"The first was a trip down 80s nostalgic lane, the second was an improvement and an entertaining action film in its own right. This third instalment has lost its grip on classic action films that charged its predecessors, so much so that even aficionados struggle to find enjoyment in this mindless mess. Barney is up against an adversary from the past, in which he decides to abandon his current team and recruit younger members in order to eliminate the enemy uprising. Aside from the predictable old versus young sub-plot, does the story sound familiar? Is that a resounding yes? Well, you would be right. The exact same narrative structure where the Expendables must defeat the disposable enemy mercenaries from creating global terror which then concludes with a short fist fight with the antagonist before they all grab a pint at the local bar and wait for all this to blow over...! Now, we have horrendous visual effects which include but not limited to: false explosions, disastrous demolitions, helicopter dogfights, Stallone's still face and...wait, that's not visually altered? Oh...anyway, the point is the quality of the acting, action and storytelling has lowered drastically. So low, that it comes across as tired and generically uninspired. Introducing new fresher faces to the team was a good idea, but their chemistry is nowhere near as dynamic as Statham and Lundgren. The cheesy banter was non-existent, it's only when the experienced players come onboard that the entertainment value heightens. Snipes taking a dig at himself for tax evasion, Schwarzenegger shouting ""get to da choppa!!!"" and Gibson being his usual crazy self, that is when the dialogue and characterisation strives for fun. Banderas was a welcomed addition however, it just wasn't enough to save this generic boring sequel. Mindless fun sure, but the worst in the series by far. Did 80s action films utilise horrific visual effects like these? No. Stop saving money and remain authentic! Otherwise this whole franchise will be expendable.",The Expendables 3

53,Vartiainen,"Still a great idea, but the execution just doesn't work",3,9 March 2015,"I love The Expendables on a conceptual level. I absolutely want to see all my favourite action stars kicking ass together. I just wish that Sylvester Stallone would admit that he isn't that good of a writer and bring in someone who actually wrote one of those cheesy 80s action flicks these movies are trying to imitate. Because really, after three films of the exact same, it's pretty apparent what works and what doesn't. We knew those things after the first film, so why hasn't this been fixed already.Though, to be fair, these seem to be passion projects for Stallone and a lot of other actors, so if these are the kinds of movies they want to make, then more power to them. But I sort of get the impression that they want to reach that same level of enjoyment their movies had a couple decades ago. And that just hasn't happened yet. There are hints of it, here and there, but as a whole... sorry, guys.And here I repeat, for the third time, what the problem is: there just isn't enough cheese in these films. They have some of the cheesiest action stars in cinema history, yet when it comes to the tone of the films, they're imitating the modern action trends way too closely. They're dark, gritty, brutal, covered in soot and actually somewhat depressing as far as plots and story lines go. Where are the one-liners, the diabolical villains, the hordes of mobs that cannot shoot straight to save their lives - literally. Where are the damsels in distress, the explosions, the bazookas, the tropical islands and other exotic locations? Okay, there are some explosions and a couple bazookas, and the actors at least try to be witty, but the rest just isn't there. These films take themselves way too seriously, and that's a problem as far as I'm concerned. The charm isn't there.The Expendables 3 is not a bad film if you simply want to see your beloved action stars being badasses together. But we didn't love the 80s action films just because they were badass. They were also fun, memorable, completely over the top and they made us want to go pump some iron while guzzling beer and grilling meat. The Expendables films, do not.",The Expendables 3
54,BeneCumb,"Not a mocking parody, a serious action flick",7,22 August 2014,"In general, I am not much into kicking-butt-and-belly type of action movies, but if/when I watch them, I prefer fast launch and no irrelevant under-plots (twists always welcome, though). In my opinion, The Expendables 3 is a decent action movie, with ""mandatory"" clichés - characteristic to all movies with team vs. arms dealer - are upgraded by several distinguishing performances (particularly Antonio Banderas as Galgo, Wesley Snipes as Doctor Death, Mel Gibson as Conrad Stonebanks). The inclusion of ""younger"" actionists, including a woman, was probably for widening the audience and varying the plot, but there was no memorable performance for me, I can hardly recognize them in other movies. Dolph Lundgren and Jet Li could have bigger roles and more elaborated characters.Unlike previous Expendables, there is less space for mockery and irony, there are less overplayed scenes, so - unless you hate similar movies - you can watch it as a separate, another action thriller. And realize again, that the generation 60+ can be more interesting and versatile than 40-, without appearing ridiculous - such as Richard Gere still trying to perform attractive playboys...",The Expendables 3

As per usual our heroes are immune to bullets, have an unlimited supply of weapons and the plot is as predictable as what day it is tomorrow. But that's all part of the fun.

57,dfranzen70,More of the same,6,17 August 2014,"With The Expendables 3, you get exactly what you expect to get, as long as you're expecting a exponentially cheesy throwback to 80s action movies that supersedes not only its two immediate predecessors in terms of one-dimensionality but also those of the earlier era. This is no Die Hard or Rambo; it's more like an old Jeff Speakman or Wings Hauser movie, at least in terms of plot. There is that magnificent cast, however, so if you like seeing a lot of interesting actors in the same movie, this might be the one for you – even if most of the cast is pretty close to collecting Social Security. Well, if they needed to, anyway.Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) takes his team to snag a high-profile arms dealer at the behest of the CIA (in the person of a Mr. Drummer, played by Harrison Ford). On the way, they break an old pal of Barney's, Doc (Wesley Snipes), an original Expendable himself. But trouble awaits when they get to their destination and discover that – dun dun DUN – the mystery man is actually Barney's old partner Conrad Stonebanks (Mel Gibson), who Barney thought he'd killed years ago. Yeah, maybe he didn't do that after all. Anyway, Stonebanks fights back, and one of Barney's guys is wounded. They pull back, and Barney reassesses the situation. His solution – get rid of the current team (Jason Statham, Randy Couture, Terry Crews, Dolph Lundgren) in favor of a younger, hungrier squad (including Glen Powell, Victor Ortiz, Kellan Lutz, and Ronda Rousey) to avenge his wounded mate and take down his ex-partner. Because a third movie in a franchise full of old guys desperately needs a change in direction, you see.Predictably, the new guys are a little eclectic (one's a woman! one's a hacker!) for old-school Barney, and just as predictably the old guard resents being let go. Ah, what the hell, let's all go! So everyone goes to beat up Mel Gibson; even Trench (Arnold Schwarzenegger) shows up. Of course, Gibson being the super bad guy and all, he has an actual army awaiting them – I believe it was the Azerbaijan military. These guys, who apparently have nothing else to do but attack 10-15 in an abandoned hotel, have tanks, helicopters, RPGs, you name it. I don't want to spoil it for you, but the good guys sort of hold their own. I know, it's a twist.It's a violent movie, but it's rated PG-13. There are few curse words spoken. At least I think that was the case, because I was distracted by the family of four a row behind me, what with their toddler and four- year-old kid in tow who never shut up. Who takes little kids to The Expendables? These guys. Anyway. It's almost a shame that this wasn't R rated, because we could have had ourselves a relatively good movie. Blood and guts and veins in my teeth, that sort of movie. But no, this one got toned down so much that the writers had to rely on the actors, and come on. These guys aren't actors so much as positionable action figures. There isn't much witty repartee, either, although there are a few nods to earlier movies – catchphrases from Schwarzenegger and Stallone, for example. Or to Snipes' personal life.The Expendables 3 was not a terrible movie, and I appreciate that. Good job on the filmmakers for not stinking too much. But this probably is one that can wait for home video. That is, if parts 1 and 2 left you with so many unanswered questions.",The Expendables 3
58,PWNYCNY,Perhaps the worst major motion picture produced in the 21st century.,1,25 August 2014,"For those who enjoy wasting their money and time watching bad movies, this movie will be a joy. But for those who value artistic excellence and high quality entertainment, you are now warned: stay away! This movie is a cinematic disaster. One could attribute this tepid result to poor acting, but that would be charitable because there is no acting. The acting isn't even cheesy; it is non-existent. Except for Mel Gibson, every member of the cast is merely reciting lines. Some of the so-called performances are downright shocking in their shallowness. Perhaps the most egregious example is that of Antonio Banderas. His clownish performance in this movie has to be the nadir of his career. Arnold Schwarzenegger is a shadow of his former self. It could also be said that the movie lacks a compelling story. That too would be giving the movie too much credit. What is supposed to pass for a story is so unoriginal and so lacking in depth as to render it superfluous. The actors recite lines, but the lines do not form a story. No character is ever developed enough to warrant empathy or any other audience reaction. If only the cast were playing caricatures of their former roles, then maybe that would have generated some excitement or at least laughs. But sadly, they're not even caricatures. The movie does include several scenes with unintended humor, but this movie is not a spoof. It is a serious attempt to present an action and adventure motion picture, and the attempt fails. If this movie was played for laughs, then maybe there would be something positive to write about, but that would have required that the cast actually be comical and act and not just show up. There's no point in assigning blame for such a poorly produced production; it does not matter. Over-the-hill action actors may have a place in cinema, but this movie is not their venue. Give them a good story, solid direction, and interesting lines and maybe the result would be satisfactory. It happened with the Wild Bunch (1969); there's no reason why it can't happen again.",The Expendables 3

Sylvester is still leading his older action buddies into battle, but it's a smaller group this time, including Jason, Dolph, Terry and Randy.

In the opening scene Sylvester & team are breaking Wesley out of prison because they need him on their next job, being short handed and all. Mel is their next job and you learn that he was a co-founder of the Expendables, along with Sylvester, but they had a falling out and Mel was thought to be killed by Sylvester-That's why Mel goes over to the dark side. Things go wrong on the new mission and Mel puts one of the Expendables out of commission so Sylvester, not wanting anyone else to get hurt, goes to Kelsey Grammar-sort of an agent for mercenaries-to get a new, younger team, including Ronda Rousey-MMA fighter-, Kellan Lutz-the Twilight movies- and Victor Ortiz-boxer. The new team, being a little green, gets captured by Mel so Sylvester has to go back to his old team plus Antonio Banderas tags along as an eager, talkative and funny addition. Bruce Willis does not show up and is replaced by Harrison Ford as the man that gives the Expendables their missions-I read that in real life, Bruce wanted too much money so he was replaced-I guess you could say, he was expendable.

61,alindsay-al,a below average film that is the worst of the series,4,19 June 2015,"I enjoyed the first two expendables films and now I have seen the third film in the franchise and at least I can say there was two good expendables films. The premise of this film sees Barney ditch his team for a new younger team in an attempt to take down his ex ally turned bitter enemy. Sylvester Stallone is an action legend and he does a good job in these films because you can see that he cares about these films and how good that they actually are means allot to him. It feels like a more personal journey for his character in this film and it makes his character a bit more relatable. Jason Statham has a bit of a smaller role in this film but he has done a good job in this film like he has in the previous films as the character of Christmas. The new additions to the cast Harrison Ford, Wesley snipes and Antonio banderas all do a good job in their roles and really add something to this film. The best part of this film, however, is Mel Gibson as the villain and he is easily the best villain of this franchise. He looks like a top quality actor and he delivers a performance of the highest quality and with some of the best lines in the movie. Unfortunately the film adds a group of young actors to the mix and you don't care about any of them and the film focuses way too much on this new cast of people that have nothing to do with being in this film. The story really is the worst part of this film, the whole point of these films is to focus on 80s action stars being in the same film together. But this film focuses on the new young stars who are bad actors and don't add anything to the franchise and actually hinders it. There are some funny lines in this film and also some really well done dramatic lines especially by Gibson. But there are some parodies in these films and it just takes you out of the situation and makes these characters not interesting. There was the big controversy about the fact that this film is not rated R but I don't think it really takes anything away from the film and there are some really good action scene in this film. But you really have to suspend your disbelief to buy some of the things that happen in this film and it does take you out of the film.

62,estebangonzalez10,They just won't go away,5,17 August 2014,"""How hard can it be to kill ten men?""The third time is the charm, right? Wrong! By now we already know what we are going to get from an Expendables movie. We know it is going to have generic action scenes, very little going on plot wise, and a lack of character development. We've even learned not to expect much from the crowded 90's A-list cast because they are mostly all reduced to caricatures. But if you enjoyed the first two films in this franchise then you are guaranteed to enjoy this as well because it pretty much gives you what you expect. There are plenty of old school action scenes, lots of explosions, and several cheesy one-liners. The nostalgia factor is a key element to these movies, but the problem is that we have seen plenty from these actors recently with a few exceptions. The attracting thing about these films was being able to watch these guys together, but that kind of rubbed off us in the first film. There is no novelty left and only true fans of the genre will be satisfied. The thing that The Expendables has going for it is that it knows who its target audience is and they focus on them exclusively without even attempting to reach a more mainstream audience. They give fans exactly what they want. I even think this was an improvement from the second film, despite the fact that it was overlong and it became tedious at times. The final climactic scene was also a disappointment and it really doesn't get more generic than that. Plot wise I always forget what these films are about, I can honestly not remember what they were fighting for in the first two films and I imagine I will forget everything about this film in a few days. The main attraction is getting to see these guys working together and all I remember from the second film was the cameo from Chuck Norris and that Van Damme was a satisfying villain. This third film has some interesting cameos, but there is nothing much more to it.Expendables 3 was directed by Patrick Hughes, who directed the little known but warmly received Red Hill in 2010. The story is basically the same as the previous two films in the franchise with some new additions and a new villain. This time the Expendables have to face a former founder of the team, Stonebanks (Mel Gibson), who has turned into a dangerous arm dealer. We are first introduced to Barney (Stallone) and his crew as they are freeing a former partner named Doc (played by Wesley Snipes). Together they embark on a mission to try to stop Stonebanks and along the way Barney signs up a younger crew with the recruiting help of Bonaparte (Kelsey Grammar). Other than Mel Gibson and Wesley Snipes the other new faces in this film are Antonio Banderas who plays a comical Spanish character named Galgo and Harrison Ford who has replaced Bruce Willis' Church as one of the directors who hires Barney's team. So there is a lot of testosterone in this film with scenes of these buffed up guys carrying weapons on one hand and a beer on the other. It is the ultimate definition of macho men from the 90's. It is even comical at times so I found it hard to keep a straight face, especially with all the cheesy dialogue. I did enjoy Snipes performance as I hadn't seen him in over a decade. Antonio Banderas was a bit too comical and Mel Gibson really didn't present a real threat as the villain. The film really suffers from a poor screenplay and it wastes the talented cast perhaps because there are just too many characters and so little time for a decent and engaging story. We never really care for any of these characters and I'm surprised I even remembered some of their names despite having seen them in 3 films already.",The Expendables 3

This was pure mindless fun and super entertaining.So, Sylvester Stallone and his boys are back, this time with some tech savvy young recruits as they try to take down a former team member and Expendables co-founder who has crossed over to the dark side. (Mel Gibson) is now a notorious arms trader hell bent on wiping out Barney and his associates. Whatever, its good guys vs. bad guys.Arnold ""get in the chopper"" Schwarzenegger stole the show and was just hilarious, cracking me up in every scene he was in basically just by impersonating himself. I'm smiling now writing this. Antonio Banderas was also quite funny in a different sort of role than I've seen from him before.I also had a moment when I was like holy sh!t Stallone and Gibson are hand to hand fighting each other. It was very cool, especially as a child of 80's action movies. Gibson was truly excellent as the bad guy, playing his character low key until you notice his eyes. Crazy town. He may just have found his calling post breakdown shunning.Other faces included Dolph Lundgren, Harrison Ford, Jason Statham, Kelsey Grammar (yes really), Wesley Snipes,(nice to see him again)Jet Li, Terry Crews and little Kellen Lutz. 8/18/14",The Expendables 3
66,lukem-52760,GREAT ACTION PACKED FUN WITH AN AMAZING ENSEMBLE CAST,7,29 April 2020,"I love The Expendables films & part 3 is just as much fun as the other two in my opinion. I know we have a younger team that joins forces with our main team of old school action heroes & lots of people didn't like that but it didn't bother me as the younger team are pretty cool but obviously no where near as good as the proper team of aging action stars.
Now to be really honest i would say that the first Expendables film is the best made & has the best old school style story but each film is an exciting blast of old school action in their own way.
I felt there was more Heart in this film than the others & although a slightly lighter tone as in hardly any blood splatter but it doesn't ruin anything at all as the entertainment value is extremely high with 3rd act as one of the greatest big Action scenes ever & i would say that i personally like part 3 the best & with addition of Banderas, Ford, Snipes, Gibson & Grammer it's a blast of exciting entertainment.
I didn't like the silly pop music & this 3rd film is definitely the most ""Kid Friendly"" & the most ""Marvel"" feeling but it's still a big budget fun action packed popcorn Thriller.
Here we get some new additions & they are Awesome with the likes of the 90's action star Wesley Snipes, he has made some Amazing films back in his day with Passenger 57, Demolition Man (with Stallone), Money Train, Blade 1&2, Drop Zone, Murder At 1600, New Jack City & US Marshalls among others, Snipes is an action legend in his own right & is great here as one the Expendables old members that they break out of prison in the fantastic thrilling opening action sequence. Snipes plays Doc a man who is an expert with Knives & there's some funny banter between him & Statham's knife throwing Lee Christmas. Snipes fits into the rugged ageing old school action hero team perfectly & i said in part one that the team was missing Snipes. Also in this underrated Sequel we get the great Kelsey Grammar as Bonaparte another old member of the team & it's so Cool having ""Frasier"" in the group & he gives a good performance on screen with Stallone's Barney Ross. We also get the Hollywood legend Harrison Ford as Max Drummer, taking over from Bruce Willis & we get Antonio Banderas as Galgo a non-stop talking new member & we get a nice little role from the B-movie action legend Robert Davi as an arms dealer. Now the main villain here is the legendary Mel Gibson as an ex-member of the Expendables named Conrad Stonebanks & it's an Awesome performance from Gibson, the cast of legendary talent is on Fire here!!!
The standout star of the younger team is the sexy & deadly Ronda Rousy as Luna. We also get a bigger part for the King of Action himself Schwarzenegger!!! Back as Trench & all the old faces are back again.Part 3 is a very slick looking film & is probably the most fun of the Trilogy & has plenty of Awesome action scenes & funny banter & two Cinema greats going head to head with Stallone & Gibson.
A really entertaining piece of action cinema with a huge cast of greats",The Expendables 3
67,kluseba,Still cool and gripping but the weakest part of the franchise so far,7,17 August 2014,"The third part of The Expandables is another explosive action movie with interesting cameo appearances by cult actors such as Harrison Ford, Jet Li and Arnold Schwarzenegger and a bunch of old action heroes like Sylvester Stallone, Wesley Snipes and Mel Gibson as well as a younger generation of action stars such as Kellan Lutz, Victor Ortiz and Ronda Rousey. The most interesting actors in the movie are Antonio Banderas who plays the clown and comes around with a few amusing slapstick gags, Wesley Snipes who plays in a very emotional and almost schizophrenic manner where he quickly turns from being ridiculous to menacing and back again and Mel Gibson who portrays a clever, cold-hearted and unpredictable villain.Some other actors have less screen time than usual and can't always convince. I would have liked to see more of Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren and Jason Statham. Instead, the new movie introduces a younger team of Expandables but these new actors like Kelsey Grammar, Kellan Lutz, Victor Ortiz and Ronda Rousey simply don't have the charisma and talent of the old generation and feel rather exchangeable. The idea to reinvent the franchise and feature a younger cast was promising but the final result is below expectations. There are far more charismatic action stars like the younger John Cena, Tony Jaa, Li Bingbing and Iko Uwais or even the older Josh Brolin, Mark Dacascos, Liam Neeson and Keanu Reeves for example but these issues have already been discussed before. The story of this movie isn't as generic as the one of the first movie but not as diversified and dramatic as the plot of the second movie. I feel that the story is overall too similar to the second film who remains the best of the franchise to really come close to it. The Expandables 3 is still an entertaining action blockbuster but clearly the weakest of the three movies.On the positive side, the locations in the movie have become more exotic and beautiful and take place in different parts of the United States of America, Russia and Somalia among others. The setting, camera, sound and special effects are top notch. On the negative side, I'm aware of the fact that this movie isn't supposed to be realistic at all but some scenes felt so forced and unreal that it was unintentionally hilarious like the part when the motorboat in the port of Mogadishu managed to perfectly jump upon the back of a driving truck. This wasn't the case in the first two instalments in my opinion.In the end, this is a good movie if you feel like switching your brains off, getting a fast-paced entertainment and seeing many famous actors in the same movie. While the film is still solid, it's definitely the weakest release of the franchise and the seven out of ten points I'm giving here are maybe a little bit generous. Still, action movie fans can't obviously get around this movie as there are way too many gripping action sequences and cool actors around.",The Expendables 3
68,3xHCCH,Saved by the Villain!,4,16 August 2014,"All the stars this film is going to get is for the nostalgia factor. This installment of the Expendables franchise is not at par with the first two. The running time is 2 hours, but there was a lot of talking scenes. Fans of this series do not exactly want down time. They want adrenaline-pumping action from these senior old-school stars! From the first two films, we still get Barney (Stallone), Christmas (Statham), Gunner (Lundgren), and Toll Road (Couture). Caesar (Crews) was there too, but was out of commission after the first act. Trench (Arnold Schwarzenegger) still pops in and out of the scene. Yin Yang (Jet Li) is sadly relegated to a ""short joke"" cameo. For the new characters, we first see Doc (Wesley Snipes) in the first part of the film being rescued and he seemed to have a promising role, but too bad that he did not have much to do later in the film. Harrison Ford plays Drummer, covering for the role Bruce Willis used to have. I had never seen Ford act so hammy ever! Antonio Banderas is Galgo who was supposed to have been a motor-mouth comic relief, but he turned out more annoying than funny. In the second act of this film, Barney goes out to find new young recruits to replace the oldies in his group. Unfortunately, these young 'uns (Kellan Lutz, Randy Ortiz, Glen Powell and Ronda Rousey) do not have the screen charisma of the older guys, making their detour a most useless waste of time. This includes the cameo of Kelsey Grammar as the guy Bonaparte who recommends them to Barney.So far, most of the new things introduced in this third Expendables film fail to fly. However, their choice of villain is a smashing success. Mel Gibson makes a major comeback here as Stonebanks, Barney's old pal and co-founder of the Expendables who turned to the dark side as an arms dealer. He really chews up all his scenes gleefully, corny lines and all. It is just too bad that his climactic fight scene with Stallone is predictably short because of a time bomb that was about to explode. Of course, you know who has to get out of there pronto.Overall, the original Expendable team and their chemistry together still works. Too bad that they seem to have a hard time to get a better story to work with. They try to hard to inject new life, but it is either the idea is getting old, or they need to reboot the franchise completely.",The Expendables 3
69,TdSmth5,Bigger and better cast but not better movie,6,13 September 2014,"Sly and co. mount an operation to rescue someone from an armored train. It's Snipes, who is being held captive and isn't just happy for a chance to escape but wants to destroy his captor. And he does.Turns out the Snipes is part of the team and also a little whack. And his specialty is...knives? Just as Statham's. The next mission involves doing something during a drug deal in Somalia. Snipes shows his flexibility and crane operation skills... When they notice that Mel Gibson is one of the bad guys at the deal, they give up whatever their original mission there was and run, only to be chased by the bad guys. Mel manages to shoot Crews who'll be out for the rest of the movie.With Mel involved, Sly decides that the next mission to get Mel is too dangerous for his team so he...fires them. And with the help of Grammar goes searching around the world for new talent--some bunch of kids plus Banderas in a very embarrassing role. Of course the old timers aren't happy. The kids turn out to be somewhat competent and keep tabs on Mel's next deal and manage to capture him. We learn some surprising things about him. But he's indeed one dangerous guy and ends up turning the tables and kidnapping the kids.Sly's new boss, Ford, always wanted to get Mel alive to deliver him to a court in spite of Sly's objections. So Sly has to mount an operation to get the kids and confront Mel, but wouldn't you know, his old team won't let him do it alone. And everyone else also shows up for the ride- Arnold, Ford, etc. The final major battle takes place at what looks like some creepy abandoned Hotel complex in Eastern Europe.The Expendables 3 profits from some great casting additions--Wesley Snipes, Harrison Ford, Kelsey Grammar, and Mel Gibson. Unfortunately it doesn't know what to do with Snipes. Both Snipes and Statham have a unique, memorable, and cool fighting style. And yet someone decided that both are knife throwers instead? Very dumb choice. Lundgren still doesn't get enough to do either. The movie doesn't benefit from the addition of Banderas (or rather his silly character) and the kids. The whole story-line with the kids is unnecessary and exactly what the Expendables franchise isn't about. When are are they going to hire the lovely Gina Carano anyway? If they want to add some youngsters as main cast members, it's very easy, make them part of the villain's group. Speaking of which, if there is a revelation in this movie it's the mean-looking Thomas Canestraro. I sure hope to see him in more action movies.This installment also differs with the previous movies in that the script is almost devoid of humor. Sure, some of the humor in the past was childish and silly, but it was well-suited to the characters and actors. Here, they don't even bother trying to be funny. That or it's so bad that it didn't even seem funny.Then there's the issue of this movie being only PG-13-rated, which never makes for a compelling action movie. And it shows. It's not until the very final act that we get some serious action. The two initial action sequences are filmed in a cheesy, CGI, fuzzy way that isn't satisfying at all. About one hour and a half later they remembered that this was an action movie and go nuts. We get tanks, helicopters, the works. What we almost don't get at all is mano-a-mano fights, precisely Snipes and Statham's specialty. When we do get it it's at the hands of the girl...and a very skinny Banderas? My suggestions for part 4. Go back to an R-rating. Don't focus on kids, unless they on the villain's team and die. Drop Couture already, why is he in these movies anyway and why does he get more screen time than Lundgren? Forget the business about knives and let Snipes and Statham do some fighting. If you are going to get some newbie to direct get someone with an edge or a vision. Hughes direction here gets the job done barely, but it's not remarkable in any sense. Or better yet, just hire Walter Hill to direct. Don't add too many more big names. They've got plenty, so many that they don't know how to put them to good use. Finally, don't forget about the action.",The Expendables 3
70,pensman,Lot's of Boom and just fun,9,15 August 2015,"I should give the film a ten because it met my expectations and then some, I hate Stallion. At my age, he is still making films and looks great and I'm in a wheelchair and losing my hair. But if you want to see a great shoot em up/blow em up film then here it is. I will say I like a film with a solid plot, serious theme, and great actors but I also need opportunities just to watch something for escapism. This is it. The plot is silly, the theme is basic, and the actors, well, I get a chance to see the action heroes I loved when I was young and if anything, their acting has gotten better and do their stunt doubles take a beating. And I like the self-deprecating humor and irony of who is saying the lines. I gather a number 4 is in the planning stage and I for one will look forward to watching some good fun period. And the new kids were OK.",The Expendables 3
71,peterp-450-298716,A mindless movie that provides momentary amusement.,5,24 September 2014,"""I need a job! All I know what to do is kill! Goddammit!""The first Expendables movie was a hit. A collection of 80's action heroes whose expiration date already expired and look like a pile of shriveled potatoes that have lain too long in the sun. It was a tribute to those legendary years when Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Lundgren and consorts annually kicked some ass in one or other (sometimes cheap looking) action movie. A healthy dose of self-perspective and self-deprecation was abundant, with a wink to the past and using well known one-liners randomly. The second film continued on this momentum with some newbies in it, so that the entertainment value still remained at a reasonable level. And now there is the third part of this trilogy. This movie presents the same again with the established values Stallone, Schwarzenegger and Statham as figureheads, accompanied by a whole bunch of other action figures like Wesley Snipes, Antonio Banderas and Mel Gibson. Expect some overwhelming action scenes and a series of fist fights and deafening crossfires. They needed a massive amount of boxes with ammunition I guess, since there's quite a lot of shooting in this film.It's as clear as daylight that the first ""Expendables"" was a sort of parody. However, I get the impression that they do realize that the hype is over, since the seniors club is pushed aside and needs to make room for a bunch of young heroes. But wasn't that the whole idea to start up a parody with a club of senior action heroes ? Is this a symbolic gesture to say that it's time to pass it on to a younger generation? Looks like it. But if that's the case I think it would be a good idea to stop with this whole ""Expendables"" formula, because these youngsters don't impress me. Those ""Benidorm Bastards"" however still have an impressive appearance. As long as they don't move along the screen with a walking frame and need an infusion with some serum, they still look like dangerous fighters who can be very destructive.Although there isn't an intellectual story with shrewd devised twists, it sure is an episode full of action again. From the very beginning, where you'll see a fast moving train in which an ex-member of ""The Expendables"" is locked up, until the end, where Russian troops seem to crush the retirees, you won't have time to get bored. The gang of enormous muscles, who could use a mega pack Oil of Olay anyway, guarantee an explosive show. And I'm pretty sure they've broken the record of the longest action scene (almost 20 minutes) ever. If you are into that, this is surely a must see.Next to the old timers, it's Antonio Banderas and Mel Gibson who excel the most in this film. Banderas is a rattling chatterbox who takes care of the comic section. An irritating always-getting-in-the-way kind of guy who demonstrates in the end he's capable of defending himself. Mel Gibson is convincing as the deviated-from-the-straight-path former ""Expendable"" who decided that he would rather gather a fortune as a weapons supplier, instead of risking his life as a soldier of fortune. So in the end it becomes a personal matter between the two founders of ""The Expendables."" The only one who didn't fit in completely was Harrison Ford who looks very old and rather meager in between this gang of ""Duke Nukem"" caricatures. The biggest surprise was Kelsey Grammar as the intermediary who introduces Barney Ross to some candidates for a new team. A perfectly selected person who presents the candidates in a ""Frasier""-like way one by one with the necessary crystal clear analytical explanation.Ultimately this movie is a fun inbetweener that provides momentary amusement. A mindless movie with hard-hitting action and a story as a side issue. The expectations are met. Although the intention has its charms, it feels as if the ""Expendables"" formula has gotten pretty stale and lifeless. It's a combination of well-known clichéd attributes which have been used already a zillion times. It still irritates me how ridiculously dumb the opponents react. They are always standing in a queue like brainless chickens, so they can be butchered consecutively. Apparently they weren't trained in strategic attacks. It's no coincidence that the phrase ""franchise fatigue"" is used everywhere. I'm sure the list of old generation action heroes is exhausted and every known person in that segment had a guest appearance in this series. It's not just the action heroes whose expiration date expired, but also the whole concept suffers of this phenomenon.More reviews at http://opinion-as-a-moviefreak.blogspot.be",The Expendables 3
72,Enchorde,Another action-packed Expendable,7,30 September 2018,"As movies goes this might not be the most intellectual challenging one. Honestly, the story is really thin, just enough to get some kind of continuity between the action scenes. But then again, that what these movies is all about, isn't it? Full blown, over the top, incredibly implausible action. And it works, and it is fun. And as Barney (aka Sylvester Stallone) says; fun is important.Having grown up with all the action movies in the eighties and nineties, the Expendable movies is a nostalgia trip down memory lane. It is great that they have gotten all the old stars together - that they actually work together without anyone outshining anyone else. They might have gotten older, but they still know how to deliver those one-liners, to make the action work, and just keep the pace. And it is great fun (and I suspect they have great fun shooting these).Expendables 3 won't go down in history as one of those memorable films. But it delivers what it is supposed to. Two hours of solid action-packed fun.",The Expendables 3
73,questl-18592,The Expendables 3: The Expendaning,6,17 November 2020,"Just going to jump into this one. 3 is worse than 2 but the actors are better. The action, the lack of over the top violence, the awful CG, terrible one liners and what I feel to be mostly horrible use of Ford are offset by how unnervingly good Gibson is in this role. I suppose it's easy for him to play a violent psycho but it was fun to watch. The whole second team thing I could do without. Ford was poorly used except in the moments where he's tough on everyone and flexes his gravitas. Banderas and Snipes are fine but I wanted more, more Snipes especially.By the credits I knew this was a lesser movie and yet it was just as enjoyable as the predecessor so I'll give it a matching grade. By this point, you should know if these are for you and whether to watch it or not.",The Expendables 3
74,masonsaul,Good action movie,6,23 November 2019,"Unfortunately, the watered down and bloodless action sequences make this Expendables the weakest installment but The Expendables 3 is still a good action movie and the action scenes are still over the top and enjoyable. All the returning expandables once again give great performances. Newcomers Wesley Snipes, Harrison Ford, Antonio Banderas and Kelsey Grammer are all great and very funny.

I read an article about how the studio forced fans to remove videos related to the movie on Facebook and YouTube and because of that, I refused to give a dollar to the film. Such a shame because this film isn't half bad. In fact, it is almost as good as the first Expendables movie. Maybe even a little better? I'll tell you this, I liked it a lot better than the second movie. Maybe because I got to watch it at home? Who knows. But I hope they end the run of these series because thanks to the second movie, it is a bit played out. There is nothing they can do with it now.

76,Seraphion,Nice to see so many stars on one frame,7,13 August 2014,"After the last movie, Barney goes on freeing one of his old team members, Doc. And on their next assignment there's a surprise, the target of the op turns out to be Stonebanks, Barney's presumed dead old teammate, who is still alive and now is a big shot arms dealer. Stonebanks get a clean shot at Barney but instead shot Caesar to get to Barney's mind. Stonebans' trick worked, Barney feels that he's not into losing anyone else close anymore, and decides to break up the team that's been with him since the first movie. He then contacts Bonaparte, and together they recruit young guns to make a new team. With the new team, they take on Stonebanks again and succeeded. But Stonebanks apparently has a tracker with him and the team gets ambushed on a bridge. Barney was tossed into the river while the youngsters are captured. Barney then sets up to go alone for the rescue, having only Galgo, the talkative operative formerly denied entry to the team by Bonaparte, to go with him.But as the team's plane readies to taxi on the tarmac, the old team of Lee Christmas, Doc, Toll Road and Gunner Jensen joins him for the rescue. On the other side, Trench who delivered Barney's team to the location, gets in touch with Drummer, the CIA exec, and Yin Yang, who now works for Trench, to join the rescue. Barney's group get to the youngsters easily but then Stonebanks contacts them saying that the building they're in are already rigged with C4. Thorn, the tech youngster, manages to rig a signal jammer buying them time. Stonebanks then sends the army backing him. Drummer, Trench and Yin Yang come in with a helicopter, providing air cover. After all the hot action, Barney asks Drummer to pick the team up on the roof. When the team's up safe on the heli, Stonebanks catches up to Barney and they do the final battle. Barney wins the fight, just as the signal jammer runs its battery out and the building blows up. But Barney escapes by jumping to the fast rope on the heli.The story finally comes to the classic 'old dead teammate turns out to be not dead but has become an enemy' premise at this third movie. The story now strangely tries to be a touching one although the bigger part of heavy action and the hard aura by the action cast still gets the greater part of this movie. The small jokes here and there are now better and are more easily laughable. Yet there is a slightly odd situation where, besides Stallone's focus character, all the older characters like Christmas and Toll Road feels much less active due to this movie having to introduce strong new characters in Galgo and Doc.The action is as expected, explosive and brash. What's nice about the action this time is on some characters. Doc has a way to spice things up to be able to improvise on things whether it's a stealth run or a head on shoot out. Galgo is nicely a surprise because with his old looks and talkativeness, his action is not bad at all. The younger characters also brings in a great addition to the action sequences.The acting here is nicely worthy of some praise. The addition of Harrison Ford and Mel Gibson does make it better because they make their characters optimal by their acting. Ronda Rousey and Victor Ortiz gives a nice effort to act well, despite there's something missing on their facial expressions usage. Antonio Banderas makes his character worth waiting for because he can handle Galgo's eccentricity. Wesley Snipes make Doc's unpredictability nice to see.My final say is a solid 7 out of 10 score for this movie. I do recommend you to see the action this movie offer. It's a good old school fight and shoot action entertainment amidst all those superhero movies.",The Expendables 3
77,rgkarim,"Better than Number 2, but getting stale",8,16 August 2014,"Sylvester Stallone is considered by some to be one of the greatest action legends ever. With movies like Rambo and Rocky, who could blame them? Unlike other stars though, this actor hasn't stopped doing what he loves, and making sure he is the center of it all. Over the last few years, Stallone has brought back his iconic characters for one last run to close up the chapters, and some of them are done quite well. However, one series of his continues to build steam, with the promise that each installment has more action. That's right I'm talking about the Expendables, the film collection that gathers the greatest action stars together to do what elsebut bring more action. The last installment failed to thrill me, and when I saw yet another sequel I wondered how much more action Stallone could stuff into a two hour time period. Has time withered this series to a moot film, or does Stallone have some magic still left in him? To start Expendables 3 is much better than the second, despite stuffing more action stars into an already overcrowded film. While the opening fight lacked any real bite, a mere display of idealized gun accuracy and a few booms, the action started to pick up. Fans will be thrilled to watch the cast pull out some of the classic moves that we fell in love. Jason Statham and Wesley Snipes in particular had some of my favorite moves of the cast, mixing up the overzealous gunplay with some fancy knife work and mixed martial arts. Stallone also has a little balance, though he glorifies his ability to wield a pistol like a modern day Italian cowboy. Yet the action isn't just limited to the old cast, but has actually been spread out amongst the newcomers to the group. The young Expendable cadets open up with some decent CGI and choreographed stunts, and then have a mission that is a bit more strategy than gung ho rebellion. However, don't fret because action and explosion junkies will still get the fight they have been craving in the final fight, which has set the bar high for this reviewer on awesome action. Both old and new alike get their hands dirty with taking down the enemies at hand. Stunts, guns, fists, and other weapons all converge into an epic fight that, if this were to be the last installment, ends the series well. As for the story, well it's definitely not the worse thing I've seen, but it is a simple plot that is built around bringing the boom. It's a story of revenge and fighting old ghosts as Stallone tries to face his demons with the minimum number of casualties. Of course being a Stallone movie, something always has to go wrong, and as revealed in the trailers, all of the new cadets conveniently get captured. Stallone's character though does get to share some more backstory and the villain is much better than Van Dam. Mel Gibson is an iconic bad guy, whose qualities consist of strategy, shrewdness, training, and the all-important psychotic edge. All of these features have been honed from his previous roles, and his instability seems natural, and for once not overstretched in the film. He keeps his emotions in check and makes a good target to bind the group together. Even newcomers Kelsey Grammar and Antonio Banderas bring some drama to the works providing again a little more character to the war torn studs. As for the humor, this reviewer loved the comedy the writers wrote for us. The corny puns and one-liners have been replaced with well-timed comedy, either in the form of an insult or sarcasm. Banderas in particular had me cracking up, as his codependent nature and childlike obsessions had him spouting like a comedic fool. Other lines involve making fun of the hilarious quotes from some of the other stars. All of the humor is integrated into the movie well, keeping the action junkie edge going and the brotherhood as strong as ever. Stallone even has a few lines that make you laugh, but whether it's because of the writing or the fact that he still sounds like he has a mouth full of marbles. Despite the all the improvements in number three though, it is still not perfect. The balance of stars was better, but some of them get little screen time, involvement in this installment. Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture, and Terry Crews in particular got gipped the most, only bringing some humorous dialog and an occasional potshot here and there. They still fit in with the team, but this reviewer can't find much use for all these stars if you are not going to actually use them. Even veterans like Jet Li and Arnold Schwarzenegger are also robbed of their splendor, the latter getting decent screen time, but less action. Li's stunts and martial arts seem to be a thing in the past, as he's been reduced to firing a fake gun for his time in the film. Even the ending scene is a bit cheesy for me, though fans who have a similar brotherhood are going to be relating to it and raise their popcorn buckets in honor. Expendables 3 was much better than the middle installment and was a great popcorn- munching blockbuster for the summer. Fans of the series I encourage to go, despite the limitations, because it is a fitting ""end"" to the series. Even if you are a rookie to the series, the audio effects and explosions make it worth the trip for the action fan. My scores for Stallone's work are:Action/Adventure/Thriller: 8.0 Movie Overall: 6.5",The Expendables 3
78,burlesonjesse5,Views On Film review of The Expendables 3,5,21 August 2014,"Do you remember when the month of May rolled around and that meant another Star Wars movie, or when October came (falling leaves and all) and that meant another Saw movie, or when Thanksgiving was in our midst and that meant another Twilight monstrosity? Well here we are in the dog days of August and that means one thing: it's Expendables time! You know, the series of films where Sylvester Stallone hires a director, persuades a bunch of his action star buds to jump on board, gives the audience a chance to see tons of cardboard villains bite the dust, and revels in countless excuses to you know, blow stuff up. Yeah, that's the mindless, late summer ticket. Or is it? Whereas the first couple of Expendables flicks were gory and rated R, this new one holds back on the blood and guts department to garner a PG-13 rating. Was this a ploy to bring in a wider audience? I guess so. But I just saw ""3's"" box office take and it looks to bomb out in ticket receipts. A PG-13 marketing technique garnered to make money hasn't worked (in the past) and probably will never work (an example would be the debunked Terminator Salvation). The first two rated R installments of Sly's pet project grossed over $500 million worldwide. This new one might possibly just break even. What a shame.With a plot that is as thin skinned as a hairless cat, a soundtrack straight out of a Michael Bay vehicle (oh no!), camera angles that remind you of a bad B movie, and a cameo by Jet Li that registers so much as a gesundheit, The Expendables 3 basically involves a conflict between the protagonist (Sylvester ""droopy"" Stallone) and the antagonist (Mel ""darn I got phone tapped"" Gibson). Mel Gibson plays Conrad Stonebanks. He's a arms dealer and former founder of the Expendables team. Stallone plays the other founder (and current leader) of the Expendables in Barney Ross. On a job with his cohorts consisting of intercepting bombs that are going to Somalia, Ross spots Stonebanks who he supposedly killed a long time age. It turns out that Stonebanks is the conspirator behind this treacherous weapons deal. What ensues is a huge gunfight with one of Barney's men becoming severely wounded (Terry Crews playing Hale Caesar, guns specialist). To get revenge on Stonebanks by hunting him down, Ross drops his old Expendables team and quote unquote ""reloads"" with a new one.So what entices the average moviegoer to see these movies? Well it's the cast I tell you and it's comprised of Sly's peers, old school co-stars, and assorted UFC fighters (Wesley Snipes from Demolition Man, Antonio Banderus from Assassins, good old Dolph Lundgren from Rocky IV, fetching Ronda Rousey, and Kelsey Grammar). Harrison Ford, a newbie in the franchise playing CIA pilot Max Drummer, gives a substantial performance but his line readings seem a little too serious for the material. Then we have Mel Gibson who's less uptight as madman Conrad Stonebanks. His turn is the best of the bunch even though his role is a little neutered and underwritten. That leaves storyteller and screenwriter of ""3"" being Sylvester Stallone. Stallone's acting has definitely gotten worse over the years. As Barney Ross, he reluctantly picks up another lucrative paycheck. His current routine in every film is to be closed off or moody while virtually mumbling his lines off of cue cards. He's kind of like the Adam Sandler of action movies because he makes fun of or thinks he's above every other character around him.Now with a huge cavalcade of a cast consisting of macho, bullet-happy butt kickers, you have to ask yourself this question: Is this 3rd Expendables film action oriented? Sure it is. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that it's main purpose was to parody action films or just plain make fun of them. After the final credits rolled, I reverted back to my childhood when I found myself watching 1984's Missing In Action or episodes of The A-Team. The Expendables 3 copies off this in that the villains get shot up with virtual ease while the heroes (or hero) come(s) out of the whole debacle with not so much as a neosporin scratch. If ""Expendables 4"" is in the works (and it probably is), I was trying to figure out what action hero from the past (or present day) could join Stallone's relatively has-been posse. Liam Neeson perhaps? Gosh I hope not. If somehow Neeson gets contacted and gets the proverbial peer pressure from Sly, I'm praying that he does what was reiterated in the 80's and ""just says no!"".All in all, this 2 hour slop has PG-13 induced violence (lots of people die with machine guns and knives but you only see little smidgens of blood a la red food dye corn syrup), a minimal plot, mostly inane dialogue, and momentously phoned in performances. In layman's terms, The Expendables 3 is an action flick that is indeed uninspired and just plain empty. It's pretty much ""expendable"" unto itself.Of note: (spoiler alerts) The Expendables 3 concludes with a much anticipated, long awaited showdown between Gibson and Stallone. Basically it's a pedestrian fistfight that lasts about 1 minute (I'm not kidding). Oh and co-star Wesley Snipes states that his character just got out of prison for quote unquote ""tax evasion."" Way to state the obvious there Wes. Finally, at the end of the two hour running time, we see an elaborate bar moment where almost every cast member gets together to down some brewskies. Of course the Terry Crews character who was shot up earlier and looked like he was an inch away from death, somehow appears untouched and unscathed. He joins the crew for spirits and it's as if nothing ever happened to him. Sheer nonsense!",The Expendables 3
79,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,It's a nice addition but it doesn't play out like one would think,6,12 August 2014,"What made Sylvester Stallone's original entry The Expendables (2010) unique, was that it combined its cast with a number of actors that were from his time and on. According to Stallone, the first film was not blended well with its genres. He didn't know what he wanted it to be; more comedic, more dramatic - he was unsure. Then came the anticipated sequel The Expendables 2(2012) which pleased fans even more by garnering up even more veteran actors, bigger action and a more solid tone. Yet again, according to Stallone, he wasn't totally convinced of the genre it went into. After reading several updates about the movie, Stallone had stated that this entry had found the perfect balance between what he wanted in this franchise. The weird thing is, it's even less clear. But this is the least of the problems. There's a lot more here that needs to be addressed.After the events from the last film, Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) and his crew find themselves running low on manpower. With only Ceaser (Terry Crews), Toll Road (Randy Couture), Lee Christmas (Jason Statham) and Gunner (Dolph Lundgren) left, although the only one absent temporarily is Yin Yang (Jet Li), the team begins to feel a little worn. Luckily they break out an old friend named Doc (Wesley Snipes), someone from Ross' past. There they team up for a manhunt on an individual Ross & Co. never saw coming. The person they end up finding is Conrad Stonebanks (Mel Gibson), an ex-expendable. Then, with no foresight, Barney and his team are hit hard. This sends Barney into a mode where he wants to finish the job but without losing his team members. So he sets out to find a younger set of expendables. The idea is thoughtful for how it'll continue with new blood but unfortunately its execution has issues.The biggest problem is that the movie is over saturated with characters. There are too many additions for every character to be developed decently. There's nothing wrong with Mel Gibson playing a villain - the problem is showing its audience practically nothing about him. He's a villain, so of course he's going to be rude and heartless but other than that, all fans will understand is that he sells boring paintings to buyers,...or something like that. Even, Eric Roberts from the first film and Jean-Claude Van Damme from the second had clear motivations. Here, Gibson is just a black market dealer,..maybe an explanation isn't given other than his past. Gibson really doesn't even do that much until getting near the finale. However, this is nothing compared to Harrison Ford's, Arnold Schwarzenegger's or Jet Li's appearances. If you, the viewer, were expecting more time with these characters, I apologize but that isn't the case. Even Antonio Banderas is shortchanged for a good portion. There is just not enough time to fit in every single character properly. Most of their screen time is dedicated to the finale, which is nice but still will leave the audience feeling gipted. Don't get me wrong, seeing all these different actors come together on the same screen is awesome but it would've been better to introduce over a longer period that just being thrown in all at once. The old cast is able to maintain their usual charm along with the new veteran additions. This goes for the younger set or ""new blood"" as their called. They all perform nicely. The direction is what slows the movie down, almost to 2 hours. With this new young cast, the recruitment takes time, which makes the movie feel longer and bloated. When the action finally arrives, it does entertain to a point but even then there are mishaps. That being the special effects - you'd think with a less gruesome rating of PG-13, the effects would look better and perfected. When in fact, not only do some places look untouched, but also there are some action shots that are repeated,...REPEATED.Cinematography is nice at times but there were frequent changes in location so it's hard to tell and doesn't give its audience a solid ground to where the home plate is. Music is disappointing too. Brian Tyler, a composer who normally produces entertaining scores has gone into dormancy. There were only a couple times I heard a unique theme. One was when Barney worked with the younger crew, Tyler made the expendables theme sound more electronic as if to make it sound more up- to-date than as quoted by one of the new bloods ""from 1985"" - which would be the original theme, which is also maintained. The argument is that Tyler doesn't do much of anything else except recycle the same tracks from the past films. Tyler is a great composer, so why he had to be lazy, looks bad. Sigh, this is an entry that works but its stakes were raised too high this time.Stallone's third entry is fun because of how many faces in can jam into its running time, but this is also its biggest flaw. The action and music entertains to a point, but with so many characters, development takes a back seat. There are also other places that feel cheap, like its special effects and cast appearance time.",The Expendables 3
80,rannynm,We all need the movies that allow us to just sit back and let our mind melt,6,20 August 2014,"We all need the movies that allow us to just sit back and let our mind melt - the kind of movie you can watch without your brain. No thinking, no deciphering, no figuring things out. Just watch and enjoy the explosions. The Expendables 3 has plenty of that and more. There are enough bullets, deaths, explosions, weapons, punches, kicks and bruises to make any fan of action movies content. Usually in action film like this, the acting is good enough to believe the characters. Adding Mel Gibson and Antonio Banderas to this third sequel is the best thing this franchise has done. They easily give the finest performances in this film and in the whole trilogy. Antonio gives the film lots of humor and a remarkable monologue, showing his range impeccably. And then there's Mel Gibson, who works with the limitations of his script beautifully - not being too over-the-top, too psycho or too much of a cliché, he creates a villain that doesn't come off crazy or bombastic, but realistic. I appreciated their performances.As for other aspects of the movie, there isn't really much that struck me as outstanding. The sound is great, the special effects are nice, the script is an action movie script. You have typical character archetypes - tough girl, stubborn prodigy, attempts at humor, one liners and lots of explosions.To sum up this film, I would quote critic James Berardinelli's (Reelviews) review on The Expendables 2, ""Does exactly what it's supposed to do-no more, no less."" What does that mean? No deep thinking, more explosions. Taking into consideration its success and flaws, I give this film 3 out of 5 stars, meaning I recommend you see it. It's a nice film to see if you wish to get a few laughs and relax your brain. Because of the huge amount of violence and the profanity , I recommend this film for kids ages 16 to18. The MPAA seems to be getting more lenient with their ratings but KIDS FIRST! considers excessive profanity inappropriate for younger kids.Reviewed by Willie J, KIDS FIRST! Critic.",The Expendables 3
81,Rob_Taylor,Too Many Actors Spoil the Broth...,6,6 August 2014,"It's hard to get excited about the third installment of almost any franchise. In general, you should know what you are getting into by now and any criticism may seem churlish.That said, I'm not one to miss a good churl! So what's wrong with this one? Well, like the tagline says, there are just too many actors in this film. So many, in fact, that some, like Jet Li, literally get a couple of minutes of screen time and then they are gone.The new characters are just woefully miscast. Who are most of them anyway? Are they supposed to pave the way for an Expendables: The Next Generation sort of spin off? If not, then all they are there for is to be rescued by the old hands and, quite frankly, there are simpler and more enjoyable ways of accomplishing a rescue plot line.The plot, at least, is straight out of an 80's movie, which is the point of the whole franchise, of course. But that doesn't necessarily excuse it being weak and predictable.All in all, this feels like a movie too far. If you want my honest opinion, I think they shouldn't have tried to drag out this franchise to a third movie. It's all starting to look a little desperate on the part of all concerned.There is little tension, no surprises and precious little humour. When people like Arnie are forced to repeat quips from their heyday movies, you know something isn't right.SUMMARY: Action that somehow manages not to be exciting. Actors that should know better and a tiresome ""script"", all combine to make this outing a little dull and boring.",The Expendables 3
82,Sandcooler,"Competently made, but not a lot of fun",5,31 August 2015,"Particularly to this franchise's standards, ""The Expendables 3"" is a surprisingly joyless affair. I can't quite put my finger on why, but it just seems like everyone's bored with these movies now. It may look like that because the CGI effects get more abundant with every new entry. This thing has so many scenes that appear to be mostly computer-generated, I'm pretty sure they shot all of Arnold Schwarzenegger's scenes in his trailer. It also doesn't help that this movie is suddenly PG-13 (do 13-year-olds even know who Stallone is?), so it's mostly cartoon violence: these new villains don't even bleed when they get their throats cut, how would that work? The obligatory emotional scene is even lazier than usual, this time around it's Hail Caesar (Terry Crews) who's fighting for his life after the villain shoots him very early in the movie. Why does there always need to be a scene like that in these movies? The characters are cardboard cut-outs that are well...expendable, and you know he's going to make it because these guys survive massive explosions by slightly jumping. If it's actually time to kill an expendable, they just bring in a new cannon fodder character like Liam Hemsworth played in the second one. We all know this. Stop pretending this is suspenseful. The near-death (cough) of Caesar is used to set up the second act, which features Stallone fighting alongside newer, younger actors: but apart from MMA-fighter Ronda Rousey none of them make much of an impression, so particularly that part is a massive bore and in an already unimpressive movie.I guess the non-climax to this movie sums it all up. Van Damme lost his head in the last one, Mel Gibson is...shot in the chest? If they're not trying, why should I?",The Expendables 3
83,Matt_Layden,"Expendables 3 is a fun, yet flawed ride.",7,24 July 2014,"On yet another routine mission, the Expendables stumble upon an old friend, Stonebanks, one of the original members of the crew and now, a vicious war lord. Can Barney look past the revenge and get the job done, or will it consume him until it's too late?The Expendables 3 throws a lot at you and for the most part, it sticks. It follows the same formula as the previous films: open up with a big action set piece, introduce the problem, get the team together, suffer some form of defeat, band the team together again and shoot the hell out of everyone until the finish. What this film does better, is give the new members something to do and deliver on the action. The final sequence in this film alone warrants a watch in my books as it's the best action the series has delivered yet. Just like last time...this time it's personal. I know, they seem to be running out of ideas, but this series never cared for realism, story or plot. The sole purpose was to give the old stars of the 80's one last hurrah. Well, it caught on and they seem to have enough fuel left in their engines to keep up with the young kids these days. This entry balances both old and new. We have an even bigger Expendables team, with the introduction of Wesley Snipes's Doc, a knife wielding sarcastic medic and Antonio Banderas' Galgo, a guy who desperately needs to be in the action and never shuts up about it. Both are given ample amount of screen time to justify adding them, with Banderas stealing the show in every scene he's in. Without a doubt, he is the stand out character this time round. Harrison Ford basically replaces Bruce Willis, he literally says Willis is out of the picture. Just one of many...MANY winks and nods to the camera about the outside world (snipes has a great one in the beginning and Arnold closes it with a classic Predator line).But what about the original members who've been with the series since the beginning? Well, they do get left behind, literally at some point. Yet the film never feels like it abandons them. They still have some of the best scenes and make the third act what it is. Poor Terry Crews is giving the least amount to do though, I won't spoil why. Both Jet Li and Schwarzenegger have small cameos as well as Kelsey Grammar. Each have their comedic moments in a film with a lot of laughs. The new kids include Kellan Lutz (Twilight), Ronda Rousey (UFC Fighter), Victor Ortiz (Boxer) and Glen Powell (Small Roles). They all have their charm and ""abilities"" although I feel Ortiz got the short straw and is showcased very little. Finally we come to the man himself, Mel Gibson, as the villain. He has a few scene chewing sequences that he seems to have fun with, and is withoutadoubt the scariest villain in the series, but he needed a bit more to do. JCVD was showcased quiet a bit in the the second film, as was his right hand man Scott Adkins, but very little time is spent with Gibson. You never feel the emotional relevance of this character to the group. Maybe a flashback might have helped flesh out his significance better, but instead we are given just some dialogue and then we move on. The performance is there, the character is not. This leads up to a final fight between Stallone and Gibson, much like the second film and just like that one it falls a bit too short. All this build up and we get a lackluster final fight. The Expendables is a lot more fun than the series should have been. The second film and now this one, learned from the mistakes of the first. These films are suppose to be fun and thankfully this one is. The Expendables vs the Army at the end is some of the best action sequences of this year.The film does have some really bad CGI though, stuff you would expect out of a Roger Corman SYFY MEGASHARK film. With that aside, this film is a great addition and a nice send off....hopefully.",The Expendables 3
84,brando647,Abandons all the Elements I Want in an EXPENDABLES Movie,4,10 July 2015,"THE EXPENDABLES 3 is an endurance trial to sit through. I have so many issues with this movie I don't even know where to start. I will say I'm glad I didn't pay to see this in theaters but, then again, if I'd seen just how dull it was I wouldn't have spent the money to add it to my collection. I found enough to enjoy in the first two to keep me interested until this point but I think three's enough. This is the point where Sylvester Stallone has officially lost touch with what the fans want in this series. Everything the fans have been clamoring to see or proclaimed their love for in this series is ignored and we end up with a generic action film of mind-numbingly boring proportions. This time around the Expendables' mission is personal. The team is commissioned by the Agency (have they ever confirmed it's the CIA? I can't remember) to interfere with an arms deal where someone is selling off some thermobaric weapons. The mission falls apart when Barney Ross (Stallone) realizes the man selling the weapons is Conrad Stonebanks (Mel Gibson). Stonebanks is one of the founding members of the original Expendables and believed dead. When one of the team is injured in action, Barney begins to worry for their wellbeing and disbands his crew, opting to form a new team of younger blood that might stand a better chance in defeating Stonebanks. And then it's just a long blur of gunfire and explosions.The movie opens with one of the better sequences in the entire film (getting the good stuff out of the way, I guess) when the Expendables stage an attack on an armored train to free the prisoner it's transporting. That prisoner: Wesley Snipes as Doc or ""Doctor Death"" or the Surgeon because I've seen him referenced as all of them in different places and the screenwriters apparently couldn't agree on a name. Bringing Snipes in at the start is a smart move. These movies are all about bringing together the most popular action stars into one vehicle and Snipes has been missing from the first two due to his own personal legal issues. He feels right at home here, even if his performance is laughable as the spaced-out former Expendable with some of the film's corniest dialogue and line delivery. It's all downhill from there, unfortunately. It immediately moves into the arms deal sequence where the bullets and explosions don't mean a thing because Stallone refuses to let his Expendables live up to their name. His big dilemma in this movie is his concern that, as his team grows older and continues putting their lives in danger, they're at risk of dying in action and never getting to live out their lives to the fullest. So, rather than actually kill off an Expendable (which would serve to shock the audience into realizing that there are real stakes in this movie), he cops out and injures one, with the audience fully aware that it doesn't matter because he'll certainly be back later.And that illustrates my biggest issue with THE EXPENDABLES 3. It's totally toothless. The soft PG-13 rating, the lack of blood in any of the violence, the inability to actually kill off a team member to drive a point homeit all adds up to a movie with nothing on the line. Guns are nothing more than muzzle flashes. People grunt and fall down. It all feels annoyingly staged. Which it is, because this is a movie. But we don't need to be reminded of this while we're watching it. These men are responsible for some of the bloodiest, more awesome action films of their generation. The violence in those movies was brutal and you knew the guy on the receiving end wasn't walking away. Not anymore. Not here. It's toned down to reach the younger generation. You know, the people who are too young to have seen Stallone or Schwarzenegger or Snipes in their prime. The crowd that has no vested interest in the premise of this movie. It's just stupid and it feels like a betrayal from the filmmakers. But just in case they haven't alienated the target audience enough, they go so far as to take the actual Expendables out of the game for the middle of the film. Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, new addition Wesley Snipesset aside in favor of Victor Ortiz, Ronda Rousey, Glen Powell, and Kellan Lutz. I'm not going to spend much time on this rag-tag group of mostly non-actors but let's just say there's no chemistry.All of this couldI emphasize couldhave worked if the writing were better. If the movie was actually fun. But it's not. It all just sort of drones into a blur of fighting and noise that's occasionally interrupted with a quip from one of the stars hearkening back to their better movies (it took three movies to finally get Arnold's ""Get to the choppa!""?) but even these moments feel tagged on like a bandage to make us feel better about the fact that the movie features nothing that the fans have been vocal about wanting to see in this franchise. In the end, I can't call THE EXPENDABLES 3 utter garbage because it's not painfully bad (though my eyes were nearly strained from constant rolling) but it is dull. It has a few cool moments (Gibson's performance, minus the horrendous dialogue) but it's still just disappointing.",The Expendables 3
85,bob-rutzel-1,"Watch for the action stunts, CGI and Special Effects",5,27 November 2014,"After a failed mission, Barney Ross (Stallone) retires his old team and recruits a new one. His new mission is to go after Stonebanks (Mel Gibson) who is a vicious arms dealer, who wants to wipe out Barney and his team. The only reason to watch this movie is to see all the action stunts and special effects whether by CGI or real and they are spectacular. No doubt about it. Some may cite another reason: to see all the action hero stars in one place and most notable are: Jason Statham, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Wesley Snipes, Dolph Lundgren, Jet Li and Randy Couture. Harrison Ford, Antonio Banderas and Kelsey Grammar also appear. Newcomer Ronda Rousey as Luna, a former nightclub bouncer is actually quite good, beautiful too. Antonio Banderas's character as Gaigo was meant as comic relief, but he was annoying and not funny. The best performance was by Mel Gibson as Stonebanks as he put the much needed drama into this. A downside I saw was the forced banter whereby they all ragged on each other at times. The banter was lame, not funny and I expected better. The CGI and special effects win hands down. The editing was spot on. Kudos. Watch for the Action stunts via CGI or otherwise.Because Jet Li did not do any fighting in here I suspect he will be somewhat prominent in Expendables 4, if there is a 4. I'm just saying.

86,moviexclusive,"Still as action packed – without the blood – and still as humorous as before, but this burgeoning ensemble of old and new action stars has gotten too bloated for its own good",6,11 August 2014,"At first, it was fun. Then, it got familiar. And so to avoid the inevitable sequel fatigue that had set in among the franchise's core fanbase of baby boomers as well as to broaden its appeal to a younger audience, Sylvester Stallone has decided to expand the cast list from 80s and 90s action stars to young upshots like Kellan Lutz, Glen Powell, Victor Ortiz and Ronda Rousey. That is in addition to adding Wesley Snipes, Antonio Banderas, Mel Gibson and Harrison Ford to the 'Expendables' he had already recruited over the past two instalments.Does it bloat? Most definitely. The surest example of that is how Jet Li only appears on screen for a grand total of five minutes during the messy extended finale, confined to a helicopter firing a machine gun. It's hardly the best use of a talent like Li, but hey series regulars like Terry Crews, Randy Couture, Dolph Lundgren and even Jason Statham also get short shrift this time round. For that matter, so does Stallone, but that is also because Mel Gibson as the villain is hardly a substitute for Jean Claude Van Damme in the previous chapter even though Stallone lets himself and Gibson have the same mano-a-mano finish.It is therefore only logical to ask – has 'The Expendables' gone the way of its title? Yes and no. Let's begin with its flaws, the most obvious one being that there is just too many actors and too little of each actor. In order to introduce a younger, fitter, and more tech-savvy team, Stallone and his co-writers Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt force his old crew to sit out a good hour of the film. And yet that time-out hardly gives their newbies any much time to define themselves either individually or as a team, since their grouping is prefaced by a barely necessary recruitment drive where Stallone and a mercenary head-hunter played by Kelsey Grammar travel around the United States to pick them up.Don't get us wrong – we're not expecting more exposition to do the character development; after all, the Expendables have always been characterised by their unique s(killing)-sets where each plays a complementary role to the entire team. Sadly, even up to the finale, none of the actors get enough limelight to distinguish themselves from one another or to live up to the expectations of their fans; more significantly, their teamwork lacks the grease of a well-oiled machine, so much so that their collective presence is no different than a ragtag group of well-trained mercenaries whose common trait is that they just refuse to die. There are glimpses of the latter – like how Snipes and Statham cover each other's back during the climax – but such moments of chemistry are few and too far in between.Its cardinal sin however is even more fundamental. For none other than commercial reasons, Stallone and his director Patrick Hughes have intentionally toned down the violence, trading the grisly R-rated brutality of the last two movies for a virtually bloodless PG13 outing. That's an undeniable – and some may think unacceptable – cop-out when you consider the roots of the franchise back in the 80s, one that robs the film of a more visceral impact especially during the plentiful gun battles. It is also particularly alienating for fans of these old-school action stars which Stallone has assembled, who are understandably expecting the carnage to be much more brutal.Yet even though it is flawed, it isn't completely expendable. Save for a handful like Statham and Ford, none of the other stars can open a movie on their own, and Stallone here gives fans of Wesley Snipes and Mel Gibson a chance to see their icons on the big screen once more. In turn, Snipes proves that he has lost none of his brash charisma as the knife- wielding, probably psychotic Doctor Death; and Gibson chews up the scenery as the megalomaniac ex-Expendable Conrad Stonebanks, enjoying every minute of his screen time with swagger, pomp and chilly menace.There may not be as much humour as there was in 'The Expendables 2', but the zingers still pop. You'll find digs at Snipes' tax evasion, Stallone's stroke, Bruce Willis' absence from this one, Statham's accent and even Schwarzenegger's famous line from 'Predator'. Some of the most amusing moments are reserved for Banderas, who as the fast-talking eager-to-please desperado Galgo add some fleet-flooted verve to the middle stretch of the movie, which – with the absence of the old guard – comes quite close to feeling like a stretch.Hughes does some commendable work with the action, which compared to the earlier two 'Expendables', comes off sleeker and more polished. The opening sequence where Stallone's old team break out Snipes from an armoured prison locomotive is literally a bang, and from their next mission at a seaport in Mogadishu to the new team's maiden one breaking into a high-tech building, Hughes maximises his mid-sized budget for some skilfully executed mayhem. Even the obligatory overblown conclusion deserves grudging praise, maintaining some sense of coherence while giving each one of the sprawling cast something meaningful to do before the credits roll.It's the biggest assembly of action stars yet, even by the standard of ""The Expendables"", but like we've said, that comes at a cost to both the old and new cast as each character gets even less defined as before. Still, no other movie has ever come close to bringing together such an ensemble, and probably no one other than Stallone ever will be able to. If you're in the mood for nostalgia, then this throwback to the 80s and 90s will probably do just fine; but other than that, this third instalment is unlikely to win any new fans to either the stars or the franchise.",The Expendables 3

It was worth it a lot. All the old team is here, with Sly, Arnie, Randy, Dolph, Jet and others still being strong and great, and with several excellent additions - Mel Gibson is a huge success in this part, but then, there are absolutely awesome Wesley Snipes and Harrison Ford. All the actors do good job, and the young blood is of great merit here, too, with Lutz being very nice to see. The tempo is very fast, and the video effects deserve a big Thumb Up. Then, there are all those funny allusions to the old fame of past, and the jokes are very cool. The only part that some viewers may find a bit weird is that deliberate focus on long close-ups with all those wrinkled faces that do not betray traces of efforts to look younger or fresher.

88,quincytheodore,"Old and new, mostly old, meet at this worst of the Expendables series.",10,20 August 2014,"With more star power than ever the third installment is actually a regression instead of improvement. While some actors undeniably show their age, Wesley Snipe, Antonio Banderas and Mel Gibson as the new additions have acting and action quality. Yet the result is a dull movie made up by less appealing fights and more plodded pacing. There's barely any excitement, self-deprecating humor or grandiose action that's expected from Expendables. At this state it's just below average action flick and a waste of the star value.The cast consists of actors who had headlined their own successful movies, and possibly still could do so in present time. However, the high number of characters doesn't help much as the movie tries to divvy screen time to accommodate them. Each probably has one or two scenes on their belt, and even that is mostly shared with Stallone. Without sounding too rude, Stallone looks as if he still wears the residue of makeup from his fight in Rocky IV. It's honestly sad to see some of them age, Ford and Arnold also don't look very compelling.Story isn't told that well either, screenplay is fragmented and the editing is a bit choppy. The flow is erratic with scenes seemingly too short and dialogues are too campy and prolonged. It appears messy as though the movie wants to incorporate several sequences in a row but fails to deliver a polished pace. This translates into the fights, which unfortunately are less engaging than the previous two titles. The violence has been dumb down into vanilla fight, typical punches and shooting that are eclipsed by more brutal and fast paced action of late. It has its moments, Wesley Snipes and Ronda Rousey look more convincing, but overall tone of the action is definitely softer.What worse is it uses more CG this time. Preceded by horde of summer blockbusters before it, that also have emphasis on CG, the movie's looks artificial and apparent. If audience wants to see obviously fake explosion or stunt, they would but the ticket to mutated turtles show. The Expendables 3 simply doesn't offer any that hasn't been done better by recent movies. Despite the flaws, Mel Gibson produces a good acting, better than the rest at least. Antonio Banderas also brings his usual fiery performance, although the material could be better for him.It's a hard case to recommend The Expendables 3, what separates it from some Cinemax retro movie is the name line-up, and it's even more disappointing that a movie with these names turns up to be so mediocre.",The Expendables 3
89,Abdulxoxo,One last time,7,5 December 2020,"The last installment in the Adrenaline-filled Expendable series. Sylvester Stallone is amazing as ever, as the leader of the Expendables, Weasley Snipe is funny with his real references jokes, Harrison Ford is a good replacement of Bruce Willis, Mel Gibson is menacing as the villian, it's obvious that he's having fun with his character. Statham, Ludgren, Crews, & Rourke are all good in their roles, tho they're mostly sidelined in favor of the Newbies, speaking of which, I think their inclusion in the story kinda takes away the fun, this franchise is about the old school dudes having fun, telling jokes and one-liners, taking on bad guys and revisiting the good old days. But it's still cool, that they tried something new, Ronda Rousey is pretty cool.The action sequences are quite entertaining and fun; the gun shootouts and the explosions are well staged, but it's bit tone down 'cause of PG rating. The cinematography is good, and the score does it best and complements the scenes.
Overall, The last installment in the Expendables saga might've lose the wow factor, but has enough humor, guns and explosions to keep one entertained and engaged throughout.",The Expendables 3
90,MR_Heraclius,I enjoyed this movie,7,23 February 2020,"After the mediocre first and insultingly stupid second part this one finally delivers what the series always set out to do: elderly action stars in ironic, fun action scenes. The humor works much better here and doesn't feel as forced as before and the new additions are great. Especially Gibson obviously had fun with his villain role. Sure, this still isn't one of the smartest films ever made and it certainly wouldnt have needed the young additions. But at least the film is fun and thoroughly entertaining, unlike the stupid second part.",The Expendables 3
91,Troy_Campbell,Tired and often cringe worthy.,5,20 August 2014,"The degree of enjoyment you get from a movie like this comes down to one thing: how far does your nostalgia go in forgiving the horrendous acting (Stallone in particular), the lousy dialogue and the cringe worthy attempts at humour? For me, alas, not quite far enough. This threequel is essentially the geri-actioner equivalent to the Transformers series. Both have become louder, bigger and more explosion-y, whilst also being stupider, unnecessarily longer and featuring Kelsey Grammar looking tired and disinterested. Grammar's not the only fresh big name addition to the already chockers cast, with Mel Gibson and Antonio Banderas (both good) adding some much needed spark whilst Harrison Ford and Wesley Snipes (both not so good) ham it up to eye-rolling levels. There's also a clan of new youngsters on board (including UFC's Ronda Rousey), but they are so one dimensional and lacking in charisma they're hardly worth mentioning. The bombastic set pieces are relatively exciting mind you, and when they're not augmented with distractingly bad CGI (thankfully infrequent) they manage to get the heart racing. In fact, if it just focused on capturing the hard-hitting action of its stars' crowning achievements from the 80s and 90s, instead of pumping out crummy self-referential gags with a permanent smirk, this film – along with the whole underwhelming franchise – could have been a far superior old-school blockbuster.",The Expendables 3

93,baumer,A letter to Sly,8,12 August 2014,"Dear Sly,You are a terrific writer. You have made and written some of the best screenplays of my youth and of my adult life. You wrote Rocky, did the screenplays for First Blood, Rambo, Cliffhanger, The Expendables and Homefront. All fantastic films.When you made The Expendables, you thought to bring some of the best action guys around, and put them in one film. You called on your friends and because of this you were able to get Dolph, Mickey, Eric and of course Bruce and Arnold. But more than that, you had an ideal. You let each actor do his thing. Jet and Dolph had terrific battle and then you had Jet and Jason fight it out in an epic battle against Gary Daniels. Then you had Randy fight it out with Austin, after you had one awesome go with him. Then, in perhaps one of the most unselfish moves in the film, you got Terry to toss the bomb when you couldn't. The whole point to this is you let everyone shine. The first film was bad ass because of this.The second film got away from this. You still let Statham do his thing but your battle with Van Damme was poorly executed. And in my opinion, the last battle should not have been with you and him, it should have been with Dolph and Van Damme, for obvious reasons ( I know you know this but to spell it out for you...they were in Universal Soldier together and both are world class martial artists).Then comes the third. You get a dream cast. All your friends are in it and you even manage to get Harrison Ford, Wesley Snipes and Mel Gibson. It's never been done before and it certainly got me interested in the film. But once again, you messed it up. You forgot what made the first so special. It wasn't because all these guys could fire guns, it was because they could kick some serious ass. Dolph and Jet are world class martial artists, Statham and Gibson have played ones in films. You have MMA guys and of course Snipes who is also a real life ass kicker. Then you get Banderas to come in, talk the whole film about how good a killer he is, and then what do you do with all these guys? NOTHING. They just come along for the ride, shoot a few guns and then you fight Gibson for about 15 seconds. WTF! The story line with the young kids was interesting but again, you did nothing with it. Why not let Roussey show her stuff? Why not let Lutz fight someone? And how about killing a few people? You did none of this, you just had a bunch of actors fire guns. You have so many story lines here. You even set it up by saying that you were all getting too old for this stuff. But you just let it go. You should have done what you did in the first. Here is how the end of the third film should have went.The bomb is defused. You find Stonebanks. You guys start to fight. But just like Grammar told you, you can't win this thing. Stonebanks is too good. As you are holding your own, but clearly losing, out of the smoke, in a slow motion shot, comes Jet Li, who as we all know was in Lethal Weapon 4 with Mel. The two of you stop fighting. Mel looks at Jet, makes some kind of comment about how short he is. Jet stops, takes his jacket and weapons off. He squares off to fight Gibson and the two of them put on on a martial arts display while you stand aside. Jet eventually destroys him, because, you know, he's a true life bad ass. With Gibson dead, Jet picks you up and helps you to the chopper. As he does, he tells you that now you should pay him more money. The two of you laugh and then you live happily ever after.The Expendables was never all about you. It was about a team. But with the sequels, you took the focus away from the team and made it all about you. Shame on you, Sly. You let me down, big time.And you let your fans down.6/10",The Expendables 3
94,blott2319-1,Mind-numbing and moronic,2,31 August 2020,"The Expendables 3 (aka Toxic Masculinity 3) is about as dumb as you'd expect. Plot takes a back seat most of the way through so that we can just watch an endless parade of lunkheads blowing crap up. They bring back all your favorites from the first two films, and even waste 20 minutes of our time in the middle introducing a new cast of younger people. I always thought the point of these stupid movies was to give washed up action movie stars one last hurrah before they have to hang it up, but now we have to meet a series of no-name youngsters who will be prominently featured through the rest of the film. Not that I care all that much since every character in these movies feels like the same guy with a slightly different look. They all are basically indestructible, and simultaneously perfect at everything they do. It's kind of mind-numbing when you see everyone playing the same tough, hard-edged dude with zero charisma, and a complete unwillingness to admit any flaws. And, no, adding one token female to the mix doesn't help in any way. Frankly, they couldn't have made Ronda Rousey act more like a guy if they tried.I will give one small caveat to my complaints about The Expendables 3, and that is Antonio Banderas. While everyone else is running around trying to compensate for what the steroids have done to their penises, he is actually trying something different. He's got a quirky, silly personality that genuinely made me laugh. It's like they actually allowed one of the heroes to be insecure and less than perfect, and it was delightful. Otherwise, this movie was just as bad or worse than the two that came before it. This joins a select group of movies I've watched that are overflowing with action, and yet I manage to get bored with them. To be lumped in with a Transformers movie is not a good thing. In fact, in the final big battle, I lost all concept of space and location in the film. People were everywhere and it was impossible to track where the heroes were in relation to one another, which was made worse by the fact that we have like 27 heroes at this point. The Expendables 3 is for the crowd who like something less thought-provoking than a shut-your-brain-off movie, this is a remove-part-of-your-brain movie.",The Expendables 3
95,brchthethird,Action-packed but neutered - the least of the franchise,6,14 November 2014,"By now, you're either on-board with the Expendables franchise or you think it's one of the many examples of what's wrong with action films today. I quite like the action films of the 80's and 90's, even the lower-quality ones starring Michael Dudikoff and other C-grade ""actors."" For me, this dose of nostalgia is quite refreshing in a way, although by now it seems to have run its course. THE EXPENDABLES 3 is watchable, but there are a lot of flaws and artistic choices which make it considerably less entertaining than it could have been. For one, the PG-13 rating should be a red flag. Yes, Hollywood is a business but it should know who its core audience is and tried to please them rather than pander to younger moviegoers. Despite diminishing returns stateside, the second film actually grossed more overseas than the first one indicating that there is a market for this type of mindless action film. My biggest complaint with the PG-13 is that it necessitates bloodless violence, which is this series' stock-in-trade. Its biggest draws are gratuitous violence, well-crafted action sequences and witty repartee. However, the PG-13 neuters this by delivering bloodless gun battles with little to no visible repercussions. Bullets make impact without blood spatter and knives puncture flesh only with a sound effect. Not only is the violence dampened, but it is obscured by shoddy camera-work and editing. Generally, the action sequences are comprehensible but a lot of the fun was lost in the editing room. There's also the issue of the newer, younger Expendables. They could have been a fun addition/substitution, but literally none of them could act worth a damn and they were really only given one scene (or two) a piece to show off their skills. Beyond that, they were reduced to being a plot device. Still, despite some major negative aspects there is some redeeming elements. The core cast from the previous two is just as enjoyable as ever, even if they aren't given as much to do given the cast expansion (save Stallone). Jet Li was probably the worst example of being given little to do. He literally shows up in three scenes, says a couple of hard-to-understand lines and shoots a gun. That's it. No martial arts? That was a crime! Terry Crews is also given short shrift (could have used this for Jet Li, but chose not to), being taken out of the action early on in the game. Of the new cast members, the best (of the good guys) was probably Wesley Snipes. It's been a long time coming for his return to cinemas, and it looks like he had a lot of fun joking about his real-life troubles and delivering some choice one-liners. He also gets a couple extended action sequences to show off early on. Also new to the cast were Harrison Ford, Antonio Banderas and Mel Gibson. Harrison Ford is basically Bruce Willis' replacement, and also looked like he was having a blast. Antonio Banderas plays a motor-mouth assassin who brings some comedic energy to the film, and Mel Gibson again plays a great villain like he did in MACHETE KILLS. In general, these particular cast additions worked well with the material they were given. Another thing that this film does right is add a little more character depth than in the previous entries. Granted, it wasn't much, but at least they tried. It is also worth noting that this film is the longest in the series, clocking in at over two hours. This isn't really too much of an issue, but there is a bit of a lull in the action during the middle part.Overall, I got most of what I wanted out of this movie, even if it didn't really compare favorably with the other two. Action junkies and fans of the Expendables series should enjoy this, although some may be better off checking out the first two films. Or better yet, those truly nostalgic for balls-out action would be best served by going to the films that made these aging action stars great in the first place.",The Expendables 3
96,Joxerlives,Should definitely finish it here,6,17 August 2014,"I thought this was a passable way to spend a couple of hours but really I think Sly Stallone has very much run out of ideas at this point. The new team was a good concept but was so poorly fleshed out that they were practically indistinguishable from one another except for the Lady Jaye character who is undeniably hot (and remains refreshingly unraped or even threatened with it by the end of the story which must be unique for an attractive female character captured in an action film). Harrison Ford is good in his role, what Jack Ryan would look like today if he'd stuck to the part. Mel Gibson was also surprisingly fun as the bad guy although you'd think that people as tech-savvy as the new team would have thought to check him for a GPS tracker? The sequence in the back of the van was actually very well done and quite affecting, the realpolitik behind the mercenary business. Also finishing him off by simply shooting him seemed a bit anti-climatic. Very, very disappointing that Robert Davi, one of my favourite character actors was given so little screen time, even less than Jet Li. A few nice refs to other films, Schwarzeneger yelling 'Get to the chopper', his iconic line from Predator and 'I lied' from Commando. Wesley Snipes genuinely appealing and funny with his tax evasion line. You wonder that Jason Statham's character would mind retiring if it meant being able to play house with Charisma Carpenter (who is sorely missed here)? Would it have killed them to have some actual memorable bad guys and not just endless waves for indistinguishable cannon fodder? But somehow we've just seen it all before (especially the endless shootouts in grey and crumbling former Soviet bloc buildings) and it doesn't hang together. Sly should definitely end it here although I wouldn't mind seeing his proposed all female version 'The Expendabelles' with action stars like Sigourney Weaver, Linda Hamilton, Sarah Michelle Gellar and Eliza Dushku.",The Expendables 3
97,fmarkland32,The Last Stand...,5,30 August 2014,"This time, the greatest group of mercenaries (Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Wesley Snipes and Randy Couture) are retired by big boss Stallone in favor of a new group (of less charismatic) mercenaries (Lutz, Rousey, Oritz and etc) to go up against super villain Stonebanks (Mel Gibson!) however when the new group is captured, the old school is brought back in to save the day with the help of rival teams (Schwarzenegger, Ford and Li.) The Expendables 3 is the weakest of the series for but one reason it sidetracks the stars we want to see. All of us 80s action fans who watched Stallone flicks (let alone the Lundgren, Snipes, Jet Li and so on) want to see the stars in question share the big screen. Indeed for two movies in a row, Stallone has showed that he got what fans wanted and his formula, as meatheaded as it is delivered what we wanted, but in this sequel we are only given glimpses of what could have been. For instance Mel Gibson is a great villain, but is given no henchmen to up his stakes. Snipes, Lundgren and Li are all great in their roles, but are completely wasted by a movie that sidetracks in favor of humorless heroics from Stallone and his younger crew. Indeed this sequel actively finds away to resist all good ideas, for instance the rivalry between the old school guys and the new people, it sucks because there is a build up and then there is no pay off at all. The Expendables 3 then is a fun action move and is never boring, but after the last two entries, this is somewhat of a letdown. Here's hoping Stallone gets back to the basics and remembers why we liked the 80s action guys in the first place. ** out of 4-(Fair)",The Expendables 3
98,phubbs,The Expendables 3,4,26 August 2014,"The boys are back in town...again! and this time its PG-13 baby (sigh). All the Expendable team are back after yet another successful mission where they all had their invincibility cheats on...accept for Crews who forgot to enter his cheat code and gets nailed. But don't go getting too excited because low and behold he survives, they must have found an energy health power-up for him.So the lads are getting on a bit these days, Arnie and Sly are pushing 70 years of age and the rest of the team aren't that far behind...well some of them. Anyway despite that Sly thinks its time to hang up everybody's boots because they are now officially (according to him) too old, yet Sly still carries on with the next mission even though he's the oldest and clearly looks the worst for wear. So off he goes to hire some young blood with the help of...Kelsey Grammar? really?? what action movies has he starr...never mind. So bottom line the tough old guns are out, the new young guns are in...aaaand there goes the entire premise of the franchise.The whole plot is basically a play on how these guys are too old for this sh*t, yet in reality they're all genuinely too old for this sh*t (some of them) but they're still doing it!...badly. The plot is not worth discussing really, its the usual good guys vs the bad guys this time led by Mel Gibson...the end. As you would/should expect its pretty much exactly the same spiel as the fist two films but with new team members. There are little remarks throughout from various characters that touch on the fact the movie is a complete parody of itself which didn't really make me smile. Instead they just got me thinking how stupid this whole exercise was and how sharp and accurate those little quips are...but not in a funny way, a serious way, like stop this ridiculous charade and lets get back to old school for Gods sake. What's more the little quips merely pinpoint what is actually wrong with this entire franchise...'so what our plan is to kick down the door and start spraying bullets?', 'that's a great plan...if its 1985'. Yes that's what we want! Oh Lord! if only this film was the caliber of a 1985 adult action flick! if only!So as we know all the old school action men we wanna see have been left behind accept for Sly's ego. We are now left with some young guys I've never heard of accept for Lutz and a female MMA fighter who cannot act TO SAVE HER LIFE. Seriously I've haven't seen such bad acting in a major movie for some time, it was embarrassing to watch her try and be butch and tough. Her first sequence as the bouncer in that nightclub literately made me laugh out loud, absolutely terrible. The entire montage thing was so flippin' clichéd, would have been OK if it was actually good.Everybody is covered in thick tan makeup its cringeworthy. Sly's face looks like a beaten slab of meat, Arnie has dyed hair, Ford looks dreadfully old (why he agreed to act in this I'll never know) and for some reason they turn Banderas into a bitch. The action isn't as bad as I thought it would be in places I'll admit. There is a solid punch to it at times but it really needs some claret to fly, it yearns for it, some nice fat exploding bloody squibs. Overall its choppy (no pun intended), the thrills can be decent but without warning all of a sudden it drops into pure crapola, awful CGI choppers and a dirt bike stunt sequence? really?? you could clearly see the course and dirt covered ramps! As we plod slowly towards the predictable ending of the old school Expendables having to save the young newbies things just become more and more...annoying. All the team members are like explosive Gods raining down pain on all the faceless useless military that are swarming all over them. Not even tanks can stop them, how can a countries military be so utterly useless? Arnie throws out not one but two choppa quips that date back to his famous lines in 'Predator', Gibson's dialog is hilariously bad as is his over acting when he finally gets killed off by super Sly and as with before no one gets killed or even injured. I've said it before and I'll say it again, these films would be so much cooler if some of the good guys got killed off.Yeah its a parody of sorts and not to be taken seriously even though Sly is clearly taking it all very seriously. Sly if you wanna be a serious badass then make these adult rated action movies. I have not taken to this franchise from day one after it became apparent they weren't gonna be proper action movies like I remember. I grew up watching these guys in real hardcore adult flicks where the blood flowed, limbs flew and the f-bombs detonated in every other line. This franchise does not give me what I remember, and I'm not even wearing my rose tinted specs. These guys need to remember their roots, the roots that made them famous, they didn't become famous for childish PG family fun films. Alas now I fear time has passed many of them by and unfortunately this was not a good final curtain.4/10",The Expendables 3
99,adamscastlevania2,"So kill me I had fun, but don't show any blood",7,27 August 2014,"(62%) Despite the fact that I've waited about 2 years for this, the poor reviews and the lowered age rating meant that I had low expectations, which actually resulted in me enjoying this more than I probably should. Yes, the action is over edited and choppy, the younger characters have nothing over the older guys (Gibson and Banderas are a main highlight), and the many people featured who get shot or stabbed and not a single drop of blood is visible is of course a questionable mistake (yet weirdly there's some when a fist fight breaks out), but I still found this a fun film mainly because I couldn't help laughing both with it and at it. This really should be regarded as an action comedy and not to be taken seriously at all. The characters belong in cartoons, the plot is see-through and the action doesn't really ever stop, so for a movie over 2 hours long this went by like a mere 90 mins because you just sit back, turn your brain off, and let it do its thing. If you're expecting a better or equal movie than the other two, or maybe with an added harder edge, then you'll probably dislike this. But if you can take the rough with the smooth and just accept it for what it is then it might just simply entertain, which is all this set out to do from the very start.",The Expendables 3
100,ivo-cobra8,A terrible sequel! One of the worst Expendables movie so far!,1,6 November 2015,"*SPOILERS*The Expendables 3 (2014) is one of the worst sequels of ""The Expendables"" franchise I have just seen. What just happened? This movie really suck it is a Stupid movie! It is boring, dull, lame and over hyped too long!! The film is rated PG-13 not R! I did not want to see the new generation! That is not what the title ""The Expendables"" stands for! It is about respect to an old school action heroes not the new generation! The problems I have with this film, which they are a lot!!! Sylvester Stallone dumps his old team and replace them with a new young people, who are now ""The New Generation!"" What can I say about that? Sylvester Stallone you blew it!!!! You shouldn't dumped your old team of old school action heroes and recruit through whole film a new young generation of people we don't know!!!! Ronda Rousey made me angry the most of all the new generation: Her' 'men'' line was horrible and I feel disrespected by that. I think Ronda Rousey disrespect all men including me with this line! She wasn't the only problem with this film I had.The CGI are a pure crap with the helicopter scene with Harrison Ford in it! Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jet Li are gay!!! Yes you heard me! They are both homosexuals gay a love couple on the end of the film!!! What happened Arnold? Why are you with the beard now?! Arnold is with a beard now! I hate his new reboot film Terminator: Genisys (2015) and I hate this film!!! I just can't believe how Arnold disrespect Terminator 1 & 2 and The Expendables 1 & 2 with making those two new movies ! I am truly disappointed with this action film and with Arnold Schwarzenegger for been a long time fan of him!! I am sorry it is just not good! The battle scene on the end of the film every famous actor that I knew or action hero star is a good guy and only Mel Gibson is the bad guy. Jesus people! Where did we come from? Geesh! In Expendables 1 there was Steve Austin and Gary Daniels including Dolph Lundgren as the villains! In 2 was Jean-Claude Van Damme and Scott Adkins! This film has nothing! The film is confusing, I don't know what Mel Gibson's character is doing during whole movie. Robert Davi shows in one scene but that is it. He is not even a second villain in this like the first two films had!They should have end the franchise with The Expendables 2. Btw Nan Yu as Maggie was so much better actress than Ronda Rousey ever was! Nan Yu had more of heart, than cold heartless Ronda Rousey ever had! No wonder Ronda Rousey was insulting actress Gal Gadot for been a choose of playing Wonder Woman! What's the problem Ronda? ""If you can't stand the heat , stay out of kitchen!"" I think Gal Gadot was a perfect choice to play Gisele Harabo in Fast & Furious, Fast Five and Fast & Furious 6, it was really a shame they killed her character off and she didn't come back for Furious 7. I think she will do just fine as Wonder Woman! Charisma Carpenter isn't in this film either, she did had a small cameo scene in The Expendables 2 movie, in this film she isn't even at all. Is like she was cut off entirely from the franchise. This sequel was a massive letdown and its the worst of the year for damn sure. Stallone is going crazy! The only two actors I liked in the film, the rest of the actors sucks, the dialogs, the script and the story failed. I like Harrison Ford in here! In my opinion I think Harrison Ford did a better job than Bruce Willis ever did and a wonderful acting performance! I think he was good! Don't say he wasn't! I saw his acting performance they were convincing! Mel Gibson as villain was awesome. He performed a bad guy villain in this film perfectly and awesome, I couldn't asked for a better performance from him! Those were two actors in the movie that I love. The rest I don't. The plot: This explosive, action-packed thrill-ride stars Sylvester Stallone and all The Expendables plus some exciting new recruits. Barney (Stallone) and The Expendables come face-to-face with Stonebanks (Gibson), one of the original team members who became a ruthless arms dealer that Barney was forced to killor so he thought. When Stonebanks returns to destroy The Expendables, the latest mission becomes a clash of old-school style versus high-tech expertise in The Expendables' most personal battle yet.I am giving this film a 2/10 rating because of Harrison Ford and Mel Gibson. Otherwise I would have gave 1/10. Btw I do own this film in my Blu-ray collection but I don't like it. The first two films I can enjoy this one I can't!

101,The_Movie_Cat,"""You don't have to worry about Church any more. He's ahh he's out of the picture.""",5,7 September 2014,"An obvious dig at Bruce Willis, who was famously blasted on Twitter by Sylvester Stallone for his involvement in this series. Perhaps sadly, it's one of the few in-jokes we get in this third instalment, with no references to Wesley Snipes' prior movie with Stallone or, perhaps more understandably, Mel Gibson not sending up his personal phone calls.It's maybe something of a relief, as the second Expendables movie almost sank beneath the weight of its own chronically unfunny indulgence. This third edition sees it back on more reliable ground, even though only the very credulous would get a single surprise from any plot development that takes place over the entire two hours.With the old Expendables fired to make way for a new, younger group, what follows is completely predictable. However, it's not helped that we never really get to know the new Expendables beyond the most basic, sketch-like ciphers. You know, what with the regular cast having such three-dimensional, nuanced characterisations and all.In the first half of the new decade, Expendables has dominated Stallone's work. It's understandable, as these generic, lowest-common-denominator movies are not only kind of fun if you're really in the mood, but were also doing good business. Stallone used to have genuine ambition, but is now content in his late 60s to phone it in so much he's acted off the screen by Jason Statham. Though as his second collaboration with Robert DeNiro was the so-so but uninspired Grudge Match, it's clear that Stallone isn't the only one just churning out product.None of these films are as appallingly bad as Stallone's lowest work in the 80s and 90s. Films like Bullet to the Head and Escape Plan contain, like Expendables, zero surprises for the viewer, but they're watchable, passable indulgences. Even generic, virtually unwatchable films where he voices a talking lion aren't black marks on his resume like Judge Dredd was.Overall, though, if the best you can say about a movie is that it's ""watchable"", then it's damning with faint praise. What shines through these movies is disdain for the audience. Do the people involved in the Expendables really believe that anyone would find the ""humour"" therein to be genuinely amusing? It's insipid and patronising, and for a series that pays homage to the violent action movies of the 80s, then its lacks real teeth, particularly under its new PG-13 rating. Much had been made of the fact that this third Expendables movie was leaked before release, and that it possibly affected the box office, which currently sees it only just scraping past breaking even. However, even on its first week of illegal ""release"" it wasn't being stolen as much as older films, so maybe the answer is more simple... maybe people finally caught on to the fact that the movies just aren't very good?",The Expendables 3
102,fernandoschiavi,"The film has good moments, excellent additions to the cast and a great villain, the production wastes a lot of time trying to develop characters that nobody cares about",6,19 September 2020,"After a second film that surpassed the original in several aspects, this third part manages to further develop the characters and further elevate the action. The first chapters of the series captivated the audience, not because of the brilliance of the plot (not least because the proposal wasn't even that), but because it reminded the old action movies of the 80s a lot. Now, that same audience wanted other stars in the cast, feeding rumors after rumors. The second part, especially, had a more interesting plot than the first, but he did not lose his good acid mood and increased the number of punch lines, the phrases of films that are famous.Since The Expandables 2 there is a clear option for self-debauchery, whether playing with the age of the protagonists or with facts related to some of them. Mercenaries 3 follows this same line. Soon, the expectation for the third film in the franchise was huge, as was the cast. Sly seemed to have taken down each of the suggestions that appeared on the internet and added to the already existing group of mercenaries a few major actors like Harrison Ford, Antonio Banderas, Wesley Snipes and called Mel Gibson to play the villain. Ready. Another successful sale.A lot has changed between the initial proposal and this last film in the franchise. The first film was a tribute to the action films of the 80s, bringing everything that these films delivered to us: cartoon villains, plans revealed at the last minute, hero shooting everyone and saving the girl, and a lot of gore in between. The film worked well because it embraced that idea and gave in to it. The second, on the other hand, changed its course a little while trying to mix this original idea with the comedy created by the huge number of action stars, and the third film is the conclusion of this change in direction.Australian director Patrick Hughes in developing, in fact, a story involving the characters. There is a whole dramatic arc involving replacing battle veterans with a younger team, underscoring the need for new blood in Barney Ross (Stallone) 's team. With that, it is necessary to present the new characters and their respective skills, which takes a long time, as well as justifying the return of the old people (you didn't think they would be left out of the game, did you?). This whole stretch makes The Expandables 3 by far the series film with the best developed script, but it also reduces the number of action scenes, which are punctuated more at the beginning and at the end of the feature film. Another change easily noticed in this third film is in relation to violence. As much as The Expandables 3 continues to be very violent, there is care that there is no blood on the big screen. All aiming at a decrease in the age classification in the United States, in order to reach a wider audience. However, action fans need not fear: there are good doses of adrenaline, with the right to several impossible scenesStill, it is a film with fun moments. Starting with the rescue of the character of Wesley Snipes, right at the beginning, entitled to the unusual scene of a helicopter hiding from a cannon and the joke involving why he was arrested, regarding the life of the actor himself, who was serving time for evasion. Supervisor. Throughout the film, there are several dialogues in this sense, with the aim of referring to old successes or even problems faced by the film, such as the departure of Bruce Willis for not accepting the fee offered. It's The Expendables making fun of himself, demonstrating the good humor that guides the series. Between catchphrases and catchphrases, for example, fans of Predador (1987) may see Arnold Schwarzenegger this time shouting ""Get to the choppa!"", Instead of the classic ""I'll be back"".Despite the intense opening scene, typical of action films that sometimes mimic, sometimes pay homage, the first half of ""The Expandables 3"" is sleepy. The opening sequence is the one that stands out the most, especially in the pace in which Doc is rescued, where, in addition to the great scene under a moving train (ignore the horrific CGI effects), we are treated to sinister dialogues, racist jokes and puns personal details of Wesley Snipes himself (which is the big highlight). In the second stage, with the arrival of the new group (most of whom present poor performances or need charisma), they can no longer bear to hear explosions. In this respect, the regular filmmaker Patrick Hughes conceives good plans, but fails miserably in the total narrative construction. Ross's motivations for dropping old partners, for example, do not convince his friends or the public. The time-consuming recruitment of the new team follows. Kelsey Grammer plays the guy who helps Barney find his new warriors. As the cliché says, Barney runs into each of them at the providential moment when they are showing off their skills.In the cast, Mel Gibson demonstrates that there is still that actor inside that we know and admire, giving us memorable roles like William Wallace in Braveheart. There is no mistake in his performance and it is a pleasure to see him perform so diligently. His scenes with Stallone are exquisite. Two other actors who also stood out were Banderas and Snipes, both for making laughs with incredible scenes and dialogues, something worthy of the franchise. Snipes starts well, but soon sees his crazy persona take on a tertiary position. Banderas takes the comic bias of the film in his pocket and entertains. Harrison Ford, hired at the last minute after the Bruce Willis stampede, passes by. To close, Arnold Schwarzenegger further reduces his screen time.Compared to previous films, The Expendables 3 is a much more balanced film, that is, he does not overdo the jokes like the second film and does not take himself as seriously as the original. Regarding the story proposal, the clash between Barney and Conrad is the most interesting of the three films, without a doubt. However, the long slide - and ugly - in the most important aspect of all, which is fun. While the previous ones had R censorship and were totally aimed at the audience that grew up watching the films starring Stallone, Schwarzenegger and co, the third one tried to win the interest of the younger ones through two devices: the PG-13 censorship, allowing kids more nova could watch the movie in theaters; and the inclusion of younger actors in the cast, in order to create an identification with the younger ones.
With the formula of the series once again well applied, there is plenty of room for some ""newbies"" to stand out. Powell, Lutz, Rousey and Ortiz, worked very well and knew how to get along with the rest of the cast. Regarding fights, no one impresses more than Ronda Rousey - not by chance, she is a UFC fighter and specialist in solo techniques. Together, they make the beginning of ""The Expendables 3"" an extensive (and unnecessary) preview of what is already known: the return of the veterans in the final part. The new team only serves as a surrender to a spectrum of the action genre that the first two films in the series sought to distance themselves: that of technological paraphernalia, of intelligence on brute force. Formerly obscene, the shooting and fighting scenes become conservative and friendly, with quick cuts and a distance from the painting that show Australian director Patrick Hughes constantly fleeing blood.The film wastes a lot of time trying to do the impossible: getting us interested in the troupe of young mercenaries. They occupy precious space within the plot, do not convince anyone and look like a hindrance. As the story is badly linked, the action scenes end up seeming empty and repetitive, although well done. Better than the original, but inferior to The Expendables 2, this new sequel continues to bet firmly on the originality of the encounter on the screens of certain actors, as happens between Stallone and Harrison Ford or Mel Gibson, for example. For those who grew up watching and having fun with the films of these stars, there is an inherent symbolism in each of these moments. In the end, it is a film that entertains, even if it does not have a remarkable moment like the appearances of Chuck Norris in the previous episode of the series.Regarding the great action sequences, The Expendables 3 unfortunately does not live up to its predecessors, having scenes well below both in terms of quantity and quality. The only really exciting action sequences are the sequel in Somalia and the grand final battle between the old school mercenaries and the new generation against the army funded by Conrad Stonebanks. It is a pity to think that a director with such great potential as Patrick Hughes was unable to create action scenes as competent as his previous film, the great Red Hill (2010).With a literally explosive conclusion, this The Expandables 3 seems to be the closing of the franchise. Even because the wear is evident. The joke no longer works. In sum, the feeling is tired and repetitive. Unfortunately, The Expendables 3 is yet another film stricken by the fearsome curse of the third film. As much as it presents good moments, excellent additions to the cast and a great villain, the production wastes a lot of time in which it could deliver fun scenes to try to develop characters that nobody cares about. And if you intend to continue with the franchise, do something relatively new, don't just call big names for a reunion that has been absolutely sterile. Much is said about making a female version of the Mercenaries, it would be at least curious.",The Expendables 3
103,FilmMan47,Disbandables:This Franchise Is Officially Ruined,3,16 August 2014,"Let me make this clear once first i am the biggest Stallone fan in Pakistan ever i just love his style but sadly the man has aged and i never liked his direction but when expendables came in 2010 i liked it then a sequel came in 2012 with Jean Claude Van Damme as a villain why it failed not because the story was bad but because the director changed the same problem is with this installment a few weeks ago the film was leaked online but the thing is if you have seen the film in theater then there is a chance you might notice some minor edits i mean for once you cant help it and think that was leakage a publicity stunt by the makers it seems like it for sure because this film does not work at all.The thing about this series is you have all the old action heroes coming together old school style beating the bad guys down the fault is not in the script or characters but the execution no amount of seriousness shown here there is more focus on humor and comedy then action genre itself i had hopes but now gone if the next film is in works i am not interested i have many reasons for it.The Plot:barney is once again with his team adding some new members go after a arms dealer Stonebanks he makes a mistake by allowing a young new team go & capture him the plan is successful but Stonebanks turns the wheels and captures all of his men this leads to barney and his old team back in action for once final showdown with Stonebanks.The Cast:along with Sylvester Stallone all other previous actors returns also some of my few favorite actors are added here like Wesley Snipes he was looking young but doing some great comedy,Harrison Ford was a pleasure to watch but he is for few minutes only the thing most of us and personally i was mad at the makers making fun of Antonio Banderas he was given the most ridiculous joker type role,asking Stallone sir please i need a job to shoot some people he is running around and doing useless stunts like Jason Bourne,as for Mel Gibson he gets wasted here the weakest villain ever.This is not a action film it was like a parody of all the 90s flicks the climax is one of the funniest ever when tank comes and Stallone fights Mel Gibson it was like everyone was doing their scenes on their own the director just gave them a free roam pass do whatever you like without any input where is the balance is the question audience members will ask its about time Stallone need to stop hiring amateur directors for his films this was a serious mess.Overall Expendables 3 2014 is a film only if you like to see old guys cracking jokes at each other to put it simply this franchise is killed my rating is 3/10.",The Expendables 3
104,joebloggscity,Expend on this.....,4,23 August 2014,"Say what you like, but anyone who goes to watch this knows what they are paying for, and any high minded film criticism really should be parked on the side. So don't even bother trying to take the high ground as it's not worth the time.Watered down to achieve the 12A rating in the UK and equivalents elsewhere, we don't have as violent a movie but it's still action packed when it gets going. Problem is that after an explosive start there's a long dull period of introducing the new pups to the team, and you're bored. By the time the action restarts you really need to wake yourself up.This film is really just Sly and sidekicks. Everyone else is given such little time that it's almost just cameos for them, and there's a gargantuan cast. Antonio Banderas' character is one many will have hoped would be dumped quickly but sadly remained through the film to annoy the hell out of you. Mel Gibson is alright as the villain, an easy payday for him.It ain't the best of the series, and actually is really poor. However, if you just want brainless action then this will do (albeit a bit lighter than used to), but if you're after real old unforgiving style action then this is missing the blood and guts. A bit of a kickstart and return to its roots is needed I think else this definitely will mean this series will become expendable to even the most devoted 80s action fan.",The Expendables 3

Unfortunately, messing with the wrong people combined with the lack of experience will turn the whole operation upside down, leaving the ex-group to play the heroes and save the situation.It's a movie which brings together a huge group of celebrities, making every child's dream become true. To see together actors like Stallone, Ford or Gibson in the same picture is simply awesome, not to mention that there are much more very well-known figures. It's a movie which focuses its whole attention on the action part, the shooting, the explosions and the fast paced scenes, almost forgetting about everything else. Its story is mediocre at most, it's characters are simplistic and not very well outlined, sometimes even making questionable decisions, while its finale is highly predictable. Don't get me wrong, I didn't have high expectations regarding these but a bit more interest regarding them would have contributed a lot to the overall quality of the picture. It's great to see how a couple of people decimate a whole army but you can't create a truly great movie just with this kind of scenes.",The Expendables 3
106,bryank-04844,"'The Expendables 3' won't win any awards nor will it change the filmmaking game, but you'll definitely have loads of fun with this movie.",8,12 August 2015,"Say what you will about a cast of 80s action stars whose average age is over 55. They can all still pack a powerful punch and kick all sorts of ass. I'm here to say that 'The Expendables 3' is loads of fun with some good laughs, decent action scenes, and seven solid one-liners. With a movie like 'Expendables 3', you have to walk into theater knowing what to expect. If you go in expecting something with a lot of depth and meaning, you're going to be disappointed. But if you walk in expecting a fun thrill ride full of explosions, an impressive body count, and seeing your favorite action stars ham it up on the big screen, then you will feel like you won the lottery jackpot.It's good to see that Sylvester Stallone and his crew have finally realized what this 'Expendables' franchise can be. Instead of relying on trying to make a serious action movie, they have finally realized by poking fun at each other and having a ball with the cast, script, and action really goes a long way and makes for a much better viewing experience. For example, they break the ""fourth"" wall quite a bit here with this third sequel, whether it be newcomer to the franchise Wesley Snipes saying he has been imprisoned for tax evasion or Stallone scouting a new possible member of his Elite team, rock climbing and saying, ""I can do that."" (in reference to 'Cliffhanger'), it's all here for our enjoyment and pleasure.And producer Avi Lerner has no intention of slowing things down 'Expendable' wise, as a 4th and 5th installment have already been greenlit with former 007 Bond actor Pierce Brosnan and Hulk Hogan announcing their involvement in future sequels. This third film starts off very well, as we see our 'Expendables' (Stallone, Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews, and Randy Couture) fly in via helicopter armed with giant machine guns, and boarding a fast moving train, loaded with bad guys. Given the first PG-13 rating for an 'Expendables' movie, this first scene has about 30 deaths. Sure you won't see blood and guts too much, but the violence is there and it is brutal.Stallone and his team are there to rescue Wesley Snipes, who has been imprisoned for many years, who was a former original member of 'The Expendables' whose expertise were knives and being a medic. The next scene has the team plus Snipes head out on a job right away, which goes haywire when the big bad villain Conrad Stonebanks (Mel Gibson), a ruthless arms dealer shows up, leaving one of 'The Expendables' in bad shape. This prompts Stallone to get real angry, tell his team lead a good life and leave the Expendables, enlist the help of Arnold Schwarzenegger, and ask Harrison Ford to journey out again and take out Mel Gibson.When Stallone gets the okay, he realizes he needs more people than just himself, so he figures out that he is too old to do it alone and he scouts out with his friend Kelsey Grammar (a hilarious drunk jokester) to find new young recruits for his team including Kellan Lutz, Glen Powell, Victor Ortiz,Ronda Rousey, and the best character of the film Antonio Banderas. No matter what happens during the middle of the film, it all leads up to the small 'Expendables' team fighting Mel Gibson and his army of 500 bad guys in tanks, planes, and vehicles. And it does not disappoint. DirectorPatrick Hughes hasn't done much, only a couple of short films, but Stallone must have seen something in him an gave him this impressive job. Hughes knows his way around an action scene and instead of quick cutting every second and a half, he allows the camera to fully focus on each actor's ability to handle a gun or do their marital arts. This comes into play specifically with Snipes and Rousey, which is always good to see.I can now see why the studio wants Hughes to direct the American remake of 'The Raid'. Sure, some of the dialogue is cheesy and has no meaning, but there are some genuine moments and you can see they are all trying. But the scenes with Stallone and Grammar pack some great laughs as it seems Grammar was just messing with Stallone and trying to make him laugh the entire time. Their chemistry is spot on. And then there is the always impressive actor Antonio Banderas, whose character, Galgo is basically modeled after a 13 year old boy who gets his wish to star in a movie with all of his favorite action stars. It's too funny. Mel Gibson plays the bad guy perfectly and I wish he would take on darker roles in the future.'The Expendables 3' won't win any awards nor will it change the filmmaking game, but you'll definitely have loads of fun with this movie. And to hear Schwarzenegger yell ""Get to da Choppa"" again satisfied my 13-year old self so much that I nearly passed out. That all being said, Mr. Stallone – Please include Bruce Campbell in your next installment of 'The Expendables'. Thank you in advance.",The Expendables 3

All the characters struggle against a system that has perpetuated falsehoods. There are fisticuffs back and forth with those who claim to work for justice. The cinematography is stark and bare, with only the soundtrack adding some effect. From an artistic standpoint, there were some plot elements and character developments I didn't think were totally needed.

Visual effects were great and people working on it have to be congratulated.Casting was a dream team like. It seams that all of the actors which mean something in Hollywood showed up.And also issue of the Hague. I am glad they addressed inefficiency and slowness of the Hague tribunals, either ones for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, or the International Criminal Court (ICC). I would definitely give Stallone power to BE those courts. ;)All in all I can not make recommendation for this film. You might or might not watch it. Either way you are OK.",The Expendables 3
110,jdkraus,How can making a third Expendables movie be so bad?,4,28 December 2014,"The first ""Expendables"" movie is a good action flick despite its amateur production quality. ""Expendables 2"" is simply an awesome movie, through and through. ""Expendables 3"" is the one in the franchise that should not have been made. Predictable plot, cheesy one-liners, gratuitous action violence, unrealistic fun, badass villains, and macho good guys are the components that sell the action-packed genre. The watered down PG-13 rating has nothing to do with ruining the latest installment of ""The Expendables."" Where to begin could simply take too long of a time. So I'm just going to list some of the many problems that sink this feature into the depths of lowness.-Harrison Ford's appearance. He is too old. Plain and simple. He does not carry the energy or swagger that he has utilized for years as Han Solo, Indiana Jones, and Jack Ryan. He delivers as an old fossil that should not have been even dug up. (This is sad, because I am a huge Harrison Ford fan). Sometimes, retiring is the best thing an actor can do.-Mel Gibson as the bad guy. I will always regard him as a great actor with an intense acting style. Here as the new villain, he is given hardly any screen time and never delivers as a true badass. He does get the occasional moment of brilliance, like his line, ""How hard can it be to kill 10 people?"" But he can never be taken seriously in this role. I wanted to see him do something malicious, perhaps actually kill an expendable, or two, just to show that the good guys aren't invincible. That would have been something to see.-The editing. This has to be one of the worst edited films ever. Not only is it hard to tell which expendable is killing which henchman during the fights, but even during the low-key scenes, the lack of continuity in between shots is incredibly atrocious. Wesley Snipes is given a very good scene to act in, but the amount of times his body changes positions in between shots is so distracting that I had to turn my head away from watching the television monitor. -The plot and the film's pacing. Yes. I know. Why blame the plot? It's not supposed to be good anyway since it's a movie about good guys killing armies of bad guys. This Expendable's plot line is drug out much longer than necessary and the story is so obvious, that I could see what was going to happen an hour and a half into the movie. You might as well hit the skip button until you reach the big battle at the end. -The new faces. None of the newcomers to the expendables' team are any good. They have no element for us to like them, nor do they have any panache or significant attributes added to their characters. Ronda Rousey was particularly bad with her constant MMA skills against male baddies, and how she uttered word the, ""Men"" with disgusting contempt. Yes, we get you're a man hater. You don't need to say anything. You just broke that guy's neck and dislocated another one's arm! ""Expendables 3"" is not entirely a lost cause. There are some decent things about it that work. The appearances of Banderas and Snipes help bring life to the movie, in comparison to the pretty-faced zombies like Glenn Powell & Victor Ortiz. These actors have been in the business a long time and know how to charm audiences, especially Banderas. The final action sequence is pretty good in size and packs in some good moments of unexpected humor. The fight between Stallone and Gibson in the end is exactly how I imagined and what I had hoped for. No martial art moves. No aerobic skills or obvious stunt doubles. Just two, past their prime actors, going at it with their fists until one of them pulls a gun and shoots the other. Bloody marvelous I say!With combining new upcoming action stars and revitalizing old ones, a viewer would think that ""Expendables 3"" would do justice to its film predecessors. It does not. It fails miserably. Bad writing to an already corny, crowd-pleasing concept does not equate success. If the producers want to do right for a fourth Expendables, they need to go back to the drawing board and learn from the first two movies.",The Expendables 3

Fight scenes wee edited in a way that lacked style and impact, and the cast, well... this needs to be picked at.I get bringing in more oldies, like Snipes, Ford and Gibson, but who in gods name were those younger members of the team?I mean, they had about as much screen presence as the back of my scrotum and could act just as well as it. That girl, what was that? Was every other actress in the world unavailable at the time of casting or was she sleeping with every one of the producers to get that role? Terrible terrible terrible in every sense, and I can't understand why so many people where so excited about her role!Then there was the criminally underused Jet Li who sowed up for a wage and never got to throw a kick.

115,Min111,I knew a third movie would happen,5,3 October 2021,"I knew a third movie would happen after seeing the second movie. And I'm glad a third movie was made. Having three movies is perfect. I'm really surprised how soon the third movie came out. It came out a couple of years after the second movie. (The second movie also came out a couple of years after the first movie.) You get to see the actors and characters from the last movie such as Arnold Schwarzenegger (Trench), Dolph Lundgren (Gunner Jensen), Jason Statham (Lee Christmas), Jet Li (Yin Yang), Randy Couture (Toll Road), Sylvester Stallone (Barney Ross) and Terry Crews (Hale Caesar). Was there anyone missing? Yes! His name is Bruce Willis (Die Hard). I didn't really mind, and I don't think he was missed because he had a good replacement in Harrison Ford (Air Force One). He's one of the newest actors, and I'm glad Harrison Ford (Max Drummer) appeared in the third movie. Max Drummer can ride a helicopter. Some of the other newest actors are Antonio Banderas (Desperado) and Wesley Snipes (Passenger 57). There are many other new characters in the third movie, but the three I've mentioned are the most popular ones. I'm also glad Antonio Banderas (Galgo) and Wesley Snipes (Doc) appeared in the movie because they were missing in the other movies. The third movie is decent, but I didn't like it compared to the first and second movies respectively. The character named Hale Caesar gets injured in the third movie, but I'm glad he didn't die. I didn't want none of the main characters: dead. These good guys such as Barney, Lee and Yin Yang are like brothers. A team of mercenaries. I didn't like where Barney Ross disbands his current team of mercenaries, and he decides to recruit a new team of younger mercenaries. I didn't care about these newest members (there were four of them) because no one knows them like the people I mentioned above. No offence. I did like the woman though named Luna (Ronda Rousey). I think she's the first woman among the group of mercenaries. I know about Maggie Chan from the second movie, but I don't think she was actually a member just like Luna was. There were just too many people in the third movie I reckon, and some of the characters such as Yin Yang (Jet Li) didn't have nothing to do despite the third movie being the longest in the series. I didn't care whether these movies were short or something. I just wanted to be entertained. These are meant to be action movies. No! You don't get to see much of men such as Dolph Lundgren, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Randy Couture and Terry Crews in the third movie compared to the first and second movies because of these four new young mercenaries or recruits who took up a large part of the movie. This is the reason the third movie didn't went well with people I assume. I did like the main antagonist in the third movie named Conrad Stonebanks (Mel Gibson). He's the bad guy though. His background is interesting. Conrad Stonebanks was a former co-founder of the mercenary group. He's determined to destroy the team. I liked Barney Ross reaction when he first saw Conrad Stonebanks in the third movie. He thought the man was dead. In fact, he was presumed dead for over two decades. He now has his own team of advanced mercenaries. He's Barney Ross arch-nemesis, and these two men use to be friends. Just like with Jean-Claude Van Damme (Sudden Death) in the second movie, it was hard to see Mel Gibson (Lethal Weapon) being the bad guy in the third movie. I'm very surprised neither Clint Eastwood, Jackie Chan, Steven Seagal and even Vin Diesel appeared in these three movies. They will have made the series far far better I reckon. I missed them. I won't mind if a fourth movie is on the works, but I doubt the movie will ever happen. I'm glad I seen the three movies, and I think you should as well unless you hate action movies itself.",The Expendables 3

A high risk operation is well under way and a prestigious prisoner is rescued. Following the successful recovery, an old foe comes back to the scene and injures a team member seriously. This has to be reciprocated.Then, a big hole was dug in the stomach of this action film. Sly decides to axe his team out of concern they would not survive this revenge mission (as if they did not know that each mission could be their last) and begins a quest to replace them with newer. This resulted in watching an action film minus the action.The new team caries out a quickie mission gets captured and Sly tries to recover them. Then guess what? The original team which he dismissed before appeared on the runway and all of a sudden he had a change of heart.After a very long gap, action did resume and it was worthwhile although it arrived after we were worn out due to extended inactivity.You have a decent story with the added touch of the personal antagonism, an enviable cast list (Stallone, Statham, Snipes, Schwarzenegger, Banderas, Gibson, Ford, Li) and end up somehow making an action film with not so much action.Wish there was more ambition involved in the process.",The Expendables 3

These were the action gurus of my youth and was so excited to see more of the old school dudes kicking butt. Instead, this is a mess.

Willis was the wisest one to do it ONLY for the money (if rumors are correct).What I see now is also the ""next generation"" filtering into this franchise. I do hope they make another to get the bland taste of this one out of my mouth. But it's going to take some faces you from action movies of the 80's and 90's you thought would never sink this low.

His face seems to be getting even more interesting over the years. Arnie seemed like he was just taking up space. Stratham was good, as usual. Wesley Snipes was great. He really carried the film, with his charm, presence, and his moves. The film got off to a promising start. I had quite a few laughs, as it is quite funny. But, it just wore me down. After about 45 minutes I did not care about these characters, with no emotional depth, background, or substance. I admit, Movies like this one are hard for discerning adults to sit through. The writing was pretty mediocre, at best. The action scenes were completely over the top, but I guess that was the point. One of my personality defects is that I like to be able to make a leap of faith, without completely abandoning common sense, reason, plausibility, or science. Movies like this do not make that possible. So, see it if you love comic book characters. If you don't, avoid this bloated behemoth.",The Expendables 3

The team then must face an co-founder and ex-expendable turned rogue arms dealer.Get ready for Oscar season because Expendables 3 is going to sweep 'em. Just kidding. It seems like people are taking this movie way too seriously. It is just an action movie, right? Its sole purpose is to be a fun distraction while you're entertained in theaters. You're not there to think, you're there to see some old stars make fun of themselves while they blow sh*t up.Expendables 3 does just that, is pure delightful entertainment. Testosterone abounds, figurative gun barrel lengths are compared while the newbs show the veterans how it's done as explosions and machine guns go off around them. Story started off surprisingly strong and sometime after the new character introductions it started to lag while they were laying down the plot. This is a perfect time to go get that popcorn or some munchie candies and get ready for part II of the a$$ kicking.Expendables 3 is packed with star power and one new famous face definitely stole the show and was the source of most laughs, though I won't spoil the surprise. The Expendables 3 ups the action star ante just a bit by adding Wesley Snipes, Mel Gibson, and Harrison Ford with a few additional cameos but the franchise lost some celebrities along the way. Jason Statham, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone, Terry Crews, Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture and Jet Li are still along for the ride and paycheck. It did seem like there were an unnecessary number of new faces. Victor Ortiz was barely shown and they didn't really utilize his boxing skills so I don't quite understand his inclusion. Seems like all attention was paid to Ronda Rousey, but I digress.The ending is a free for all fight fest to smoosh some more action in the film. While lazy it was entertaining. The final scene was satisfying, gratifying and very worthy of the laughs it gets.

Stonebanks subsequently became a ruthless arms trader and someone who Barney was forced to kill... or so he thought. Stonebanks, who eluded death once before, now is making it his mission to end The Expendables -- but Barney has other plans. Barney decides that he has to fight old blood with new blood, and brings in a new era of Expendables team members, recruiting individuals who are younger, faster and more tech-savvy.

125,LloydBayer,"With watered down action and talky drama, The Expendables 3 can't keep up with the sheer weight of its iconic star cast.",4,13 August 2014,"As a sort of satirical homage to action films of the late '80s and '90s, The Expendables (2010) was more about crowd pleasing indulgence rather than critical appeal. Apart from over-the-top action, the film's biggest appeal was its ensemble cast of Hollywood action heroes. This is what made the 2012 sequel even better. With this third installment, that ensemble list is stretched even further but at an exponential risk of quantity over quality. And that isn't even the biggest problem in The Expendables 3.Reprising his lead role as Barney Ross, leader of the titular mercenaries, franchise creator and script writer Sylvester Stallone appears to have made a series of fatal errors starting with his intention of aiming for a younger and broader audience, thus downsizing the R-rated brutality from the first two films to a more juvenile friendly PG-13 (PG-15 in the UAE) in this third installment. As such, firefights and explosions are concentrated at sporadic intervals. And in doing so, the body count rises but with barely any of the blood splatter we have seen in the previous films. Joining the cast is Wesley Snipes as Doctor Death, a knife expert and former Expendable who is rescued by Barney and the crew from a black-site prison. Doc's rescue is followed by a failed covert mission in Somalia when they are outgunned by the very target they are sent to apprehend – Conrad Stonebanks (Mel Gibson), a ruthless international arms dealer thought to be dead. Turns out, Stonebanks was a co-founder of the expendables before going rogue. There's a clever backstory that reveals why Barney and Stonebanks are archrivals, but before you know it, we are dragged into the middle of a frustratingly long and talky period where Barney disbands the original crew, only to recruit younger Expendables. And all of a sudden, no one has that trigger-finger itch anymore.By displacing testosterone fuelled action with a huge chunk of drama, co-writers Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedict fill almost an hour with bar room small talk and the type of bromance found in buddy-cop films. Thankfully, humorous one-liners keep it going largely due to the inclusion of Antonio Banderas as an Expendable wanna-be with a motor-mouth to match. This is also the period where the original cast is sidelined by a new set of unknown actors – another scripting blunder that digresses from the whole point of cramming this installment with a plethora of action movie icons in the first place. Another misfire is allowing Mel Gibson to be Mel Gibson; in this case, a likable but conflicted antagonist who is just not fierce enough for a warlord wanted by the Hague Convention. Other key additions include Harrison Ford who replaces Bruce Willis as the new CIA boss, and Kelsey Grammar who plays a street smart but retired Expendable. Their inclusion adds some significance to the story even if this means using up their screen time over some of the original cast.Punctuating old-school action with dull dialogues, new director Patrick Hughes mixes it up with punchy lines from seasoned actors. As knife throwers, Statham and Snipes (as the self-proclaimed 'knife before Christmas') have plenty of lines to this effect. Meanwhile, returning cast members Dolph Lundgren, Jet Li, Randy Couture, and Arnold Schwarzenegger are in just for a few seconds. It's too bad that they have more face time on the movie poster than in the actual movie. In the end, all that The Expendables 3 manages is a mix and match pandering of old versus new. This couldn't be anymore literal in comparison to the film's biggest flaw, and that is allowing a motley crew of action icons to be guided by a director who was probably a toddler when said icons were at the height of their glory days. The train wreck in the opening act says it all.",The Expendables 3
126,p-jonsson,Good entertainment if you take it for what it is,7,27 December 2014,"This is good, actually really good, entertainment if you take it for what it is. This is a rather silly orgy in macho stereotypes, action, whacky comments, action, blowing things up, action, shooting people, did I mention action? As such a movie it fulfills its purpose admirably. Actually, if that would be the only criteria for what constitutes a good movie this would be a 10 out of 10 star movie.However, there is more to a really good movie than that and, as should be no surprise this movie falls short in most other aspects. It is the third movie in this series and as such the content of this movie should really be no surprise. The plot is nothing fantastic but it is not totally ludicrous either. I would say that it us good enough for the movie.The one thing that I would complain about is that there were really too many characters and none of them was really allowed to shine much. It really became too fragmented with this new team versus old team plot. The only one that really had a good part where his character was allowed to actually perform was Mel Gibson as the bad guy. The rest where more like guest stars. I guess this was the intention but it was really more obvious in this movie than in the previous ones. I have to say that, personally, I was not really very found of Antonio Banderas rather silly role either.As far as action and explosive special effects goes this movie does not disappoint. A few minutes of the final shootout would have blown the budget of most other movies and it went on and on seemingly forever. Sure, it was unrealistic and nonsensical for a lot of the time but it was still fun to watch. I also quite liked Harrison Ford when he made his appearance.Bottom line for me is that it was good entertainment and enjoyable two hours. It was pretty much what I expected. One thing that increased the enjoyment factor for me was that the Blu-ray disc had one of the better soundtracks that I have listened to in a long while. The track truly exercised my subwoofer without going overboard with silly low frequency rumbling and still dialogue and music came through very well. There were a lot of well positioned surround effects as well. Truly a delight to listen to.",The Expendables 3
127,James_De_Bello,4.5/10,4,26 September 2014,"4.5/10 It fails to achieve even the most elementary of its purposes, being it to provide some good old action fun with all of our favourite 80-90s action stars, but it still manages to pull off a decent flowing movie with some highlights and interesting set pieces.The movie soley relies on its cast which is no doubt top tier for what they are intended to do, but that is where they stop making a real effort. Nobody here is trying to do something special, something interesting nor surprising. They limit themselves to do nothing but what the paycheck requires. Expetions to this are soley Mel Gibson and Antonio Banderas who are the two founding pillars of the film and keep it away from total failure: their performances are both well played out and manage to make the best of their screen time, never failing to capture an opportunity to shine on screen and they both do that brilliantly when they intend to. All of their fellow cast members are simply decent and nothing more, not even Stallone is doing anything really interesting and the only two actors, other than Gibson and Banderas, who manage to have a moment are Ford and Schwarzenegger.On all of the other levels the film is very mediocre, never terrible or unwatchable, but very cheap and it surely doesn't understand tonally what it wants to or should do. It spends way too much time doing things we don't really care about and when it switches to the action it disappoints. The action is really, really sloppy and the CGI involved other than being a bit too much is totally underdeveloped. The oneliners fail nine times out of ten but thankfully that one time they actually manage to be very funny, yet they are mostly delivered by Banderas.To sum it up I did not have what I wanted from The Expendables in the portion I wanted it, but I kind of got a consolation prize in various occasions.",The Expendables 3
128,dvc5159,Old dogs learn new tricks,6,14 August 2014,"Patrick Hughes' ""The Expendables 3"" is an odd action film. Starring nearly the entire roster of '80s to '90s action heroes, coupled with a few unknown young faces desperate to be the next big action star, it bears the mark of a bloated mess. That its PG-13 restrictions not only abandons its core fanbase but also leads to rushed editing at times that leave slightly sour aftertastes after each kill, only adds to the negatives, apart from some truly dreadful CG effects. That it all boils down to another Stallone film, as he uses said action icons merely as back-up fodder to appease his egotistical lead character.And yet, despite all of that, I enjoyed it as much as the first two. How on Earth did that happen?Firstly, ""The Expendables"" franchises are what I like to describe as ""fanboy"" movies. There is no need for a plot, as long as it appeases the core fanbase, with every one liner, every weapon of choice, down to the costumes they wear. One might argue that the vastly overrated ""The Avengers"" as well as other Marvel films fall under that same category - it appeals to the fanbase.""The Expendables 3"" is an attempt to bridge the gap between the old and young generation of action, but Stallone and the ""Olympus Has Fallen"" co-writers Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt swerves back the direction back to ""you know what, we need the old band after all"". This isn't merely in the film's story, it's also outside - the blending of styles are uneven at first, but somehow come together well in the preposterously over-the-top stunt-filled finale, with both young and old getting caught into the frenzily-edited chaos. The absence of the old guards in the film's second third merely underlines the fact that we need these icons more than ever, because none of these modern day ""stars"" can carry a movie by themselves because their combined charisma is miles away compared to icons like Schwarzenegger, Gibson or Snipes alone. I don't mean this as an insult, I was amused that I managed to see what Stallone was trying to do (or perhaps I've seen way too many movies).I would strongly agree however that this film was not meant for PG-13, in many parts due to the annoying editing. No one can ever disguise R- rated tendencies as PG-13. Yes, there are a couple of sensational action sequences (particularly in the climax), but the level of violence is so clearly neutered down that one would just go ""If only"". Well, we'd have the Unrated blu-ray for that. Disappointing, because these action sequences truly have the potential to be among the best in the franchise, courtesy of Hughes and stunt coordinator Dan Bradley of the Bourne series. Ah well, Blu Ray shall await. I'm not going to mention the dreadful CGI (that thankfully weren't that abundant), but I've seen people complain of a lot of shaky-cam in the film. I didn't notice many, so kudos to that for making most of the action well-shot and framed.And yet, why did I still enjoy the film? It's because of Patrick Hughes. Only his second film (following the solid Aussie western ""Red Hill""), Hughes approaches the story with a dead-on seriousness that makes the action sequences more fun when they do come, and takes his time to invest in Barney's plight into replacing his old team with new ones, following the near-loss of one of his own, and in the hopes that the new team will subdue the villain Stonebanks with less complications. All of this is essentially a build up to a stunt-filled, sensational climax involving an abandoned hotel and an entire army against The Expendables. And also some shoddy CG helicopters.The 2nd act is a pale imitation of Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"", though Kelsey Grammar is surprisingly good in the role he's given. In fact, most of the actors seem to have a grand time in the film, especially Gibson and Banderas, the former delightfully and menacingly ravishing each second he's on the screen like a King Cobra, and the latter akin to a screw-loose monkey that borders on being the Jar-Jar Binks of the franchise (but not quite). Ford and Schwarzenegger seem to be game in the film, but the old gang comprised of Statham, Lundgren, Couture, and Crews look tired. Again, it's great to see Wesley Snipes back in action and having some funny moments on his own, but Jet Li is again underutilized, this time more so than the previous one (though it can't be helped that his disease is worsening at this stage).""The Expendables"" franchise is one which never quite satisfies its core audience and never reaches its full potential - it's too ironic for older fans to appreciate yet it's too old-school for the new generation to ""get it"". This presumably final one ambitiously attempts to fill the gap, and although it doesn't quite succeed, when all is said and done it does get the job done very well when all one is looking for is some good old-fashioned action and mayhem. Don't be surprised though when the extended cut does in fact arrive. It should be even more polished than it is now.",The Expendables 3
129,shawneofthedead,Passably mediocre; criminally lacking in fun and laughter.,4,13 August 2014,"It's not often that a franchise finds its footing in its second act - but that's precisely what happened with The Expendables. The first film, the apparent wet dream of a 1980s action movie buff, had a great cast and some good lines, but was ultimately a forgettable churn of action beats and mayhem. The Expendables 2, however, seemed to have finally tapped into what could make this group of gnarly, buffed-up old dudes really connect with a modern audience. Amidst the requisite gunplay and gore, the sequel packed itself full of oddball humour and a Chuck Norris cameo to beat all Chuck Norris cameos. Can anyone be blamed, then, for actually looking forward to The Expendables 3, especially with the addition of Mel Gibson, Harrison Ford and Wesley Snipes to the cast? Unfortunately, this third film is resolutely dour for far too much of its running time, forgetting to entertain as it attempts to mine depth from characters who should really be focused on blowing sh*t up instead.We actually get a plot this time, one that delves into the dark past of Barney (Sylvester Stallone) and his Expendables. Turns out he used to run with a different gang going by the same name and all bearing the same skeletal tattoo, including super-smooth traitor-turned-international-arms-dealer Conrad Stonebanks (Gibson). Refusing to drag his old (in all senses of the word) team into his quest for Stonebanks, Barney kicks best bro Lee Christmas (Jason Statham) et al to the curb. For back-up, he recruits a young, hot brood of mercenaries with tech skills and authority issues (Kellan Lutz, Ronda Rousey, etc). But their confrontation with Stonebanks inevitably goes south, and Barney finds out that he doesn't have the heart to treat them like collateral damage after all.The fact of the matter is that no Expendables movie needs this much depth or story. Easily the first half of the film, if not more, is devoted to Barney's wig-out over Stonebanks' miraculous resurrection (to be precise: he didn't die when Barney thought he did). In other words, this Expendables movie adds some intriguing new cast members to its roster, only to spend too much of its running time not focusing on the Expendables at all. Instead, we meet a group of gorgeous young people with lithe, toned bodies and shiny, smooth skin. If we wanted to see this, we would watch pretty much any other movie currently playing in cineplexes! The upshot of it all is that the leathery quartet of stalwarts left behind by Barney - including Lee, Gunner (Dolph Lundgren), Toll Road (Randy Couture) and the newly-busted-out-of-prison Doc (Snipes) - barely get a look-in.Other members of the cast also flit around on the periphery of Barney's angst: Trench (Arnold Schwarzenegger) turns up to work by Barney's side quite a few times, but in mostly inconsequential ways. Ford's Agent Drummer - replacing Bruce Willis and his enormous ego - is fun and acerbic, kind of, but feels like a waste of the actor's charm and talents. And the less said about Jet Li's remarkably brief return to the franchise, the better.To be fair, The Expendables 3 does benefit from a quite thrilling turn by Gibson as the villainous Stonebanks. Whatever is said about the man, there's no doubt this is an actor worth his salt - at least in comparison to former franchise baddies Steve Austin and Jean-Claude Van Damme. Gibson snarls his dialogue with a remarkable gentility and intelligence, lending the film the depth it so sorely craves. It's a shame that the script waltzes away from it after a while: in one scene, Stonebanks cannily points out to Barney's young recruits that the latter kills just as many people in his line of work, but his body-count is never questioned. It's a smart, dark seed of doubt to plant in a film that collects corpses so carelessly, but it's raised only to be forgotten in the mayhem that inevitably ensues.Ironically, the film only splutters properly to life in its final third, when its most amusing and annoying character shows up in the form of Galgo (Antonio Banderas), a kill-happy dude who just wants to find a team alongside whom he can fight again. At that point, the spark of comedy that made The Expendables 2 so enjoyable flares up, and the film gains a measure of cheeky self-awareness that it had hitherto been sorely missing.As for its action set-pieces: well, there are plenty of those. Some are quite well-executed, including parkour-heavy sequences set in and around a detonating building. But director Patrick Hughes loses track of the action beats fairly often, resulting in a murky mess of muscle and metal that never really gels into anything coherent on screen. He'll be directing the English remake of The Raid, by the way, so be afraid - be very afraid.Strictly speaking, The Expendables 3 isn't a dreadful film. Even though it's too plot-heavy for a shoot-'em-up action flick, particularly in this specific franchise, its plodding story is at least internally consistent (ish). But it also feels like a wasted opportunity: Hughes has managed to score a frankly unbelievably great cast, uniting action heroes from across the 1980s, but has flung them into a film in which they barely appear, and certainly hardly ever turn up in the same frame. That this is done with more misery than joy only contributes to a curiously cheerless final product.",The Expendables 3

Yes, I had a blast watching this film, I thought it was extremely fun and Antonio Banderas was hilarious, but there are things that could have been done better and certain flaws that could've been avoided.1. Like the choppy editing, I understand Stallone wanted the film to have a PG-13 rating in order to draw a broader audience, but that only resulted in the film looking amateurish at times and like it was rapidly jumping from scene to scene for no real reason. Plus, having made this film PG-13 doesn't make sense, it being a third installment it would've made more sense if Stallone wanted to draw a bigger audience to make the other two PG-13 as well.2. Stallone could've picked a way better set of actors in the roles of the kids, neither of the four made any kind of impression. They brought nothing to their characters. The film would've succeeded in getting it's audience if Stallone rewrote the characters and had picked actors who were already familiar with action roles, like Scarlet Johanssen, Jeremy Renner, Chris Evans, etc.Overall, the film as is is still loads of fun, despite the kids not making a notable impression and Jet Li not having a fight scene. Fans of the previous two can certainly check it out.",The Expendables 3

132,TheHonestCritic,"What was once a phenomenal action movie franchise, is now at an all-time low with the release of this ""film"".",4,21 July 2020,"""The Expendables"" (2014), as soon as I heard that it was going for a PG-13 rating, I knew right then and there that this ""film"" would be all wrong. Why make a major action film with all of these actors if you're going to just limit your boundaries by going with a PG-13 rating instead of an R rating? Keep in mind, there are several PG-13 movies that I love, but a big action film like this should go for an R rating. Never limit your boundaries! But, that's beside the point, ""The Expendables 3"" has an overlong and cliched storyline, standard to mediocre acting, and a dull cliched soundtrack. The first two films nailed the aspects of a perfect action film. When you make an action movie trilogy, or any kind of movie trilogy, the first one is typically for character development plus story and action, the second is where you take the concept and expand upon it. The third film is where it's time to try something different. But, at the same time following a resembling format to the first two films. As for the story, they were on the right track on making it a more personal plot. In which, one of their own team members, presumed dead, has returned to take revenge on the Expendables. That's a classic action movie plot, but sadly, it was not expanded upon and it was played too pedestrian as a result of lazy script writing. Film Making 101: most movies and TV shows are nothing but recycled plot lines. The key to a great movie is to take a previously used concept and add something fresh to it. That way, it would be unique to your film, thereby making it stand out. On a side note, this ""film"" is over two hours in length. That's way too long for a basic storyline like this. I don't mind a long film well executed, but it has to keep my interest all the way through. In the case of ""The Expendables 3"", a story like this one should have ranged from 90-110 minutes max. Right after the 110 minute mark, it just starts to drag on. The other big issue with this story is bringing in a group of younger characters. They really drag the story down, what little there is! Speaking of which, the acting in this ""movie"" is standard to mediocre. Granted, most of the acting is still passable, with the exception of the younger cast members. They gave the worst performances in this ""film"". Those actors are: Ronda Rousey, Kellan Lutz, Glen Powell and Victor Ortiz. None of them can act by any means necessary. That being said, maybe they'll improve as their career goes on. Now, I do understand where Sylvester Stallone, the writer of this ""movie"" was going. He was trying to use this ""film"" as a way to introduce the younger generations of acting. But sadly, their marred performances totally distracted from the minuscule cliched plot. The best performances come from the older action stars, such as: Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Wesley Snipes, Mel Gibson, Arnold Schwarzenegger, Antonio Banderas, Kelsey Grammer, Harrison Ford, Terry Crews, Dolph Lundgren and Robert Davi. Their performances are great! One of the better performances though is Mel Gibson as Conrad Stonebanks, the main villain. Once again, we have a bad ""film"" with a great villain! As for the soundtrack, it's hit and miss. It does work for the most part, but in some parts it just sounds like it's looped. Almost kind of like it was rushed together at the last second of editing in post-production! Editing in a movie is supposed to be seamless and unnoticeable. When you notice the edits, then you know that something is very wrong. This soundtrack is completely dull and forgettable. There are only two positives in this ""movie"", which are the sets/locations and the special effects. All of the sets/locations are nice and give the ""movie"" a decent atmosphere. The only other positive is the special effects. All of the special effects were well-done and still hold up today. ""The Expendables 3"" is a massive disappointment in the genre of action films. I give it 2 out of 5 stars on my personal scale, which equates to 4 out of 10 IMDB stars. Stay away from ""The Expendables 3""! There is an unrated version, but it's hardly any different from the theatrical PG-13 cut. I'm just thankful they learned their lesson, because ""The Expendables 4"" (if they ever decide to make it) will be R rated!",The Expendables 3

134,bluesman-20,For these men they are not Expendable they are family.,10,25 September 2014,"In the dedication to Fredrick Forsythe's excellent book about Mercs, The Dogs of War. He wrote To black Johnny and all the others in the unmarked graves at least we tried. Forsythe Wrote about the mercs as being a family unit. Cat Shannon lived with these men and trusted them and when they were free from the battlefield they went their separate ways until boredom or inaction drove them back to the battlefield for money or death. That dedication tells you volumes about how these men feel about each other for they are a band of brothers . The popular myth is that mercs will work with anyone as long as the price is right . While that is true to a certain extent. Most Mercs already have a group that is established and they trust no one but their own. That is what the Expendables III reminded me of. These men are a family they have no one else but them. Members come members die. But you are no matter what you will always be a member of that Merc army. The beginning to this film is a brilliant working of action of stunt work and special effects as the Expendables free Doc a original member of the Expenadables from a south American prison. The Reason is they need Doc's expertise in fulfilling their latest mission to take down a arms dealer. They have no idea who their target is until they see him. And Barney Ross knows who he is . Conrad Stonebanks the man he was once the closest to and the man with whom he formed the Expendables. Stonebanks played by Mel Gibson steals the show. In fact Gibson IS The show. When Stonebanks becomes a arms dealer and starts to sell arms to the wrong people Barney was hired to terminate Stonebanks and Barney did or so he thought. Now it's 30 years later and Barney's sins come back to haunt him. After a failed attempted to kill Stonebanks puts a Expendable in the hospital. Barney disbands the Expenadbles and forms a new group. When that group fails the Expendables reform to get stonebanks. The main part of this story is family. Arnie even has a few great moments here where he tells his friend Barney he is getting out and that Barney should too. He is getting too old for this. But Arnie's Trench doesn't take his own advice and helps out at the end. Harrison Ford's Drummer is a delight. And Antonio bandaras Well this man and this character deserve their own franchise. I enjoyed this film a lot . Like every other film in this series It gets better and better. And I can safely say this . The Expenadbles is for fans only. This is our series these men were our heroes back in the day. If you didn't know them . Take your time watch the films in which they were in their prime. Then watch this series of films. You won't regret it.",The Expendables 3
135,Meven_Stoffat,The Expendables trilogy now has its Godfather III,2,3 August 2014,"First off, nobody expects a film like The Expendables to be amazing. Even the cast and writers are aware of it, which is why the first two movies in the series succeeded. They were merely an excuse for our favourite childhood action stars to blast people's brains apart and utter cringe-worthy one-liners, and sold themselves as such, and that's why the series worked in the first place. The series was pure trash and it embraced it, and so did we. I mean, how can anyone expect a film with a scene where Chuck Norris makes a Chuck Norris joke to be anything deep? If we want Shakespeare, we'll watch Shakespeare, simple as that. And so it leads you to wonder exactly how on earth The Expendables 3 ended up the way it did. The first red flags were raised when it was announced earlier this year that the film would be rated PG-13, and that was just the startFirst off, the plot is pretty much the same as Expendables II, but with less action and more boring revenge BS. Then there's the moment where Sly Stallone (let's just say it's easier to remember the stars by their real names rather than their character names) disavows the team and brings in all these boring new people. The Spider-Man wannabe who can climb elevators- so what? The chick. There's no other reason for her to be in the film other than to be the chick. I can't remember any of the others right now because they're THAT forgettable. From there on, there's pretty much no reason for Stallone to continue with the mission. Other than revenge, etc. But of course, naturally, he continues, gets himself in trouble with his own stupid actions, blah, blubbety blip, and we get one of the most boring action sequences in history this side of Man of Steel, complete with dreadful editing and camera too close to the actionThere's also the fact that the film is PG-13, and it shows- the violence is not only toned down, but it also constrains the plot from being any more interesting in any way. We get boring gunfight after boring gunfight with some hand to hand here and there. Speaking of which, there's very little action here- there's a grand total of 4 action scenes in the film and the only one of which is interesting, being the end one- but even then, it's not as interesting as it should be. When Stallone and Gibson finally square off, the fight lasts for like a minute and then boom. Over.The one saving grace of the film is the addition of Snipes, Banderas, and Gibson. There's not much for them to work with in the first place, but they make the most of what they're given to work with, and they really do try. Banderas is an annoying loudmouth, but at least his endless talking in his scenes do liven up the pace. Snipes is always a pleasure to watch and his fight scenes are the best thing about the film, but he's under-used. Gibson always has even one of my favourite actors and his portrayal of a villain here is brilliant. I've always thought he's been the perfect guy to play a villain, and despite the cringe worthy dialogues he's given here he does what he can to brighten the atmosphere with his portrayalOtherwise there's really no reason to see this film. It's pretty much The Godfather 3 of the franchise- the sequel that was not needed and did nothing to advance any character or plot, was just recycled and had no reason to exist. And furthermore there's an Expendables 4 in production. This is despite the fact that the film leaked onto the web early two weeks before its release. To me, whoever did that must have realized just how awful the film is and leaked it as a warning, that or Lionsgate is doing this for more PR and is disguising it as an accidental leak just to cause more publicity. Either way, avoid this one like the plague.",The Expendables 3

You kind of go into a film sporting a cast like this with some trepidation. Is it going to be awkward watching a group of somewhat older actions heroes who have played some of the most iconic characters of our time, reliving their youth and trying to save the world......in a word NO. In some deep and bizarre way it works. Remember Stallone as Rocky and Rambo, Scwarzenegger as The Terminator, Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones and Han Solo, put an older head on their shoulders and give them a chance to have fun in a classic shoot em up movie with the good guys fighting the bad guys, and the fun spills out into the audience to make a highly watchable film. Stallone plays Barney, the leader of the Expendables, and when one of his own is seriously injured he makes the decision on behalf of the rest of his team that enough is enough and replaces them with younger more street savvy versions of themselves. However, all does not go to plan and the old team are brought together to fight the bad guy - Mel Gibson. When you remember the age of some of these actors, they didn't look too bad and let's face it nobody plays pain an anguish in their face quite as well as Sylvester Stallone. I reckon these guys could stand a fourth outing.",The Expendables 3

Feeling that the team might meet the same fate as Cesar, Barney decides to disband the team and recruit a younger generation of new expendables with assistance from Barney's old friend Bonaparte played by Kelsey grammar. I would say what makes the film great is the witty banter and one liners between the crew particularly Barney and lee Christmas. Harrison ford replaces Bruce Willis as the new leader max drummer. However I felt jet Li was rather underused in the film and same thing goes for Robert Davi who plays an Albanian mafia leader.

138,NightmareOnElmStreetFan,"Action icons blow stuff up, in an adrenaline action kick-ass testosterone flick!",8,31 October 2019,"The Expendables 3 is a hell improvment over messy Expendables 2. Action icons for 2014 still blows up stuff buildings with tanks. Stallone got back to the roots where Rambo III (1988) left off. I like thid film is not better than the first one but I have enjoy this movie much more than the second one. I like very much, I like this movie so damn much. The Expendables 2 is a boring terrible slow paced dull movie of a mess. Third installment of this franchis is a decent solid action kick-ass testosterone flick. There are many older stars in this film, it doesn't change the fact that they all kick ass. This movie made less money than the first two movies did. This is a prototypical ""good"" action movie -- intense, perfectly executed, original action, shown to the tune of a forgettable and occasionally insulting story.The movie is rated PG-13 but it works, Live Free or Die Hard is rated PG-13 and it worked. Sylvester Stallone did an excellent solid performance returning his old team back with a new one. I like this film, I enjoy it a lot more than garbage The Expendables 2. That is just me people hate film because it has new genartions but I don't care, that want change my likings and joy for this film. Barney Ross (Stallone) is back this time he faces off with his old enemy Conrad Stonebanks (Mel Gibson), who used to be one of his team mates. He betray Barney and his old team but Barney tought he put him down but he didn't. Now Barney dismisses his old team members and he brings a new area of EXpendables who are younger and faster. The lastest mission becomes a clash of classic - old school style versus high-tech expertise in The Expendables most personal battle yet.The Expendables 3 rounds out this throwback trilogy with Mel Gibson coming in as the baddie he is the best of this movie and a bad-ass. While Stallone, Statham headline this final (for now anyway) film in the series. Wesley Snipes and a group of 'newcomers' join in the shootout and explosive fun. Arnold is back in a few key scenes and Antonio Bandaras is off the chain in all of his. A nice tough is Harrison Ford stepping in for Bruce Willis the movie plays out as it should. EX-3 is pure balls to the walls fun. It lacks a feasible plot but bottom line to see this many aging action icons in one film is worth it in the end. I like this movie because we finally see Wesley Snipes in this movie finally Stallone / Snipes reunite and it is their second colloboration since Demolition Man (1993). Yes I love Demolition Man to death, it is one of the best sci-fi futuristic action film to grace to home video screen ever. Welcoming back in-joke to Wesley Snipes who had been sidelined by the Feds for tax evasion. His character Doctor Death was also in prison for tax evasion I am a huge Snipes fan that is Demolition Man is my movie my favorite action movie. Ronda Rousey as Luna is in this movie the only girl she was in the EX team. Ronda Rousey is a former UFC Women's Bantamweight Champion and former WWE RAW Women's champion and as Luna she was fantastic and excellent I love her performance. Antonio Banderas was crazy in this movie also he reunites with Stallone since 1995 Assassins. Kellan Lutzwas also good in this movie I like his performance.There is a lot of shootouts, tanks destroying the building explosions and really balls to the action. We have tanks in this movie the last time we waw tanks in action films were in Rambo III (1988) and GoldenEye (1995) James Bond - 007. Patrick Hughes did directed this movie well much better than Simon West. I love the soundtrack Come With Me Now - Kongos. My favorite scene is in which Barney Ross is almost captured by Stonebanks henchman, but Barney pulls out his Colt Single Action Army and shoots the bad guys one by one. Stallone did an excellent job making the final film in the trilogy.The Expendables 3 unrated version is actually better than tetarical version. I have Unrated Edition on the Blu-ray disc and I don't regret having this film. The third movie actually Works really well. At 131 min, this film should have been the second film. Everything about this movie works, good story, much better acting, better use of Arnie and believable compared with him in 2. Harrison Ford is decent in this little role, much better than Willis, Gibson is a great bad guy, unlike the mess of a JVC in 2 and I loved how Barney Ross tries to protect his crew and hiring a younger crew of nobodies. This really makes you appreciate the old guys, including Banderas, and Snipes. I think this film deserves more respect. I like this film I think this will be my favorite Expendables movie.

Well that was the first one. You had the cheesy one liners, the winks at all the films these old guys were famous for, we get it. We're in on the joke. The first one did OK money wise so they went and made a second one. More of the same, more cheesy oneliners, tons more winks, we get it, okay even though the joke was getting old. Now, 2014: another one! Do we really need this? OK, so we got more old 80s action stars, to be more precise I think they're all in the film - everyone. I saw the film, I'm sure it got a story but in one line: Mel Gibson is the bad guy, the expendables are sent to kill him and everyone else they encounter. And if you make a lighthearted film like this, keep it short. 126 is too long! 90 mins, 100 tops. Way to many slow scenes with idle banter that could have been cut. Pace should be faster for an action film! When I started watching this I turned it off after 48 mins because I was bored senseless. 3 days later I got myself to watch the rest. Sure there are some good jokes left and right but this is not great filmmaking. They are trying to milk this joke franchise for what it's worth but the audience is not that stupid coz the movie bombed at the box office so I'm pretty sure they will pull the plug after this one and it's all for the best.",The Expendables 3

This is a good example, failing in almost all aspects. For starters, direction is awful, SFX are far more better in some B (and also C movies), there's practically no acting (doesn't matter in an action movie of this type anyway) and writing is bad and somewhat amateurish. The story has potential, though, but fell into wrong hands this time. Everybody seems tired of repeating their roles all over again, lacking motivation and enthusiasm. Even an abundance of ""stars"" cannot save the movie in such circumstances. Compared to the first two ""parts"", this movie is simply weak. This old bunch should either retire completely, or wake up and make a good movie again. They could do it, but failed this time.

142,ghost_dog86,Retirement Party,4,21 August 2014,"No matter what you think of The Expendables franchise, it's common knowledge that its genre success is reliant on three things: Retro action heroes acting badass, corny one-liners and things exploding in rapid succession. Remove any one of these aspects and the movie is destined to fail. So, when a quarter of the way through ""Expendables 3"", the old guys (Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture, etc.) are scrapped and replaced by a new group of ""Expendables"" (Glen Powell, Victor Ortiz, Ronda Rousey and Kellan Lutz) it's impossible to think that this installment will not be perceived as some sort of bait and switch to audiences who paid to see old guys shoot guns. That is not to say the newbie's aren't entertaining to watch. In fact, not only were they entertaining to watch, but after the extremely lackluster opening 30 minutes, with one-liners and meandering the caliber of ""Grown Ups"", the rest of the script (co-written by Sylvester Stallone) helped these new faces by injecting some entertaining 2nd and 3rd Act plot developments (and characters) into what would have been an otherwise bland narrative. Why I gave this film a below average rating: The fact that ""Expendables 3"" has been relegated to a PG-13 format really has no bearing on this film's opening box-office failure, since this aspect had no correlation with how shockingly low budget this supposed big budget production looked. Seriously, every time characters were in a moving vehicle or simply standing outside, there was a noticeable black outline between the characters and the green screen background. Also, half of the dialogue looked to be sloppily dubbed in post-production and those ""things go boom"" moments everybody came to see looked as cheap as something out of a ""Sharknado"" movie! The fact is, the reason why ""The Expendables 3"" would be considered by most as a bad movie has nearly everything to do with the savagely underwhelming visuals.On top of the shocking cheapness of it all, director Patrick Hughes really does a horrific job with every action sequence. I don't think I'm being too harsh when I say that EVERY SINGLE action sequence was indecipherable; which is only made more disappointing when the buildup to these big moments had me leaning forward in my seat time and time again. Final Thought: The two things which save ""Expendables 3"" from being a total dud are: 1) Even throughout the bargain basement/crowdfunded feel of it all, where this film goes during the final hour is undeniably entertaining. 2) The supporting performances from the likes of Antonio Banderas, who steals the show as the rambling, out of work, comic relief, killer for hire, Harrison Ford, who is on-screen only a handful of times, but delivers the best lines of the film and Mel Gibson who properly camps it up, devouring the scenery whole as a the central baddie. That said, these positive aspects are eventually treated like the jungle in a ""Predator"" movie and simply obliterated by Hughes' blatant sloppiness and budgetary choices which may have him relegated to working for the Syfy Channel when all is said and done.",The Expendables 3

Of course it is. That is what made the franchise appealing to audiences. The action and the older action heroes doing what made them famous were the drawing points.There is only one negative about this film: Antonio Bandaras. His character is annoying from the first moment he hits the screen until the last moment. He is The Expendables version of Jar Jar Binks (or Olof from Frozen); annoying as can be.

145,herbqedi,Enjoyable antidote for hot summer afternoons,8,2 September 2014,"I enjoyed this movie quite a bit for what is. It provided humor in 3 forms: sight gags; repartee; and inside jokes. I just loved Robert Davi's cameo and Arnold's crack about marriage. The movie was two hours short - in that it flew by and I didn't look at my watch once. But I must admit, the movie may have gotten an extra half-star or more from me because my local movie multiplex gave me what I was looking for most: blissful air conditioning. Judging by the number of other seniors in the audience on a 90+ degree September day in its fourth week of release, I would say we weren't the only ones looking for heat relief with unchallenging popcorn action and humor. And that's what we got.One thing that made this movie one cut above most action films for me was the villain, (Mad) Max Stonebanks, played to the hilt by Mel Gibson - so convincingly mercenary and smug, I came close to rooting for him. OK, he's no Hans Gruber - but who is? After that, he's probably in my top 3 of action hero villains in the past 40 years. He chews up the scenery but always in the framework of who he is. A wonderful surprise for me was Harrison Ford playing the agency desk jockey in what I assumed was a cameo role. It turned out to be a major role and he provided a wonderful counterpoint for both Arnold and Sly. It almost goes without saying that Jason Statham continues to be one of my favorite action movie stars while Lundgren and Couture got to give their best performances in the series. Sly was Sly - not as good as he was in the first one, but a good straight man to Statham and Kelsey Grammar (speaking of wonderful mercenaries) and the young kids. I note other criticized the performances of the young actors. I thought the gal and the tech guy were highly engaging and well-suited for their roles. The other two provided beefcake and nothing's wrong with that. The one-joke that played on much too long was Antonio Banderas' character. This is a bit of a shame since Banderas' performance and swagger were dead-on and he still provides eye candy for those so inclined. His character was the supposed comic relief and had so much repetitive screen time for variations on the same joke that it ceased to be funny long before the screenplay continued to tell it. But this is the only irritating note in an otherwise wonderful afternoon.I came to have fun and I had fun - in blissful air conditioning. I'm happy!",The Expendables 3
146,Bruce722,Worst of the series.,5,25 February 2015,"The Expendables 3 is easily the worst of the franchise so far. Sure, it had plenty of historic action heroes and some great nostalgic one-liners (Arnie yelling ""get to the choppa"" is gold) and it even had a halfway decent plot, albeit not an entirely original one. The fight scenes were a step down from the previous films and the pacing and plot development wasn't as solid, though neither of the first two really delivered on that front to begin with. I suppose my biggest problems with the movie are two key things. The first is that the film's beginning effectively erases the characters that they established in the first two. Wesley Snipes character comes in and basically points out that Jason Statham and the rest of the expendables are newbies compared to him, even though he's only been locked up for 8 years. While this could be considered nitpicking, the first two films made the team out like a group of guys who have been battle tested for years and years together. Well, considering that the first film takes place four years prior to this one, that means the events of the first film take place with the team together for a maximum of four years, and likely less. I'm sorry but that continuity doesn't vibe. The other thing that I didn't care for was the actual newbies that were introduced to breathe new life into the cast. While I think they don't necessarily do a bad job individually, I just don't think they made sound casting decisions. This franchise has been built on action heroes of the past. If you're going to go young, you need to target the actions heroes of the present. Now certainly nobody expects Dwyane Johnson, Chris Pine, Vin Diesel, Mark Wahlberg, Chris Hemsworth, Sam Worthingston, Tom Hardy, Matt Damon, or any of the other megastars of today to sign on. For one, most of them are a little too old to act as ""young kids"" and simply put, they are stars and don't need this franchise. The money nor wouldn't be right and they likely wouldn't dare touch the films. However, there are other young up-and-comers they could've targeted that would've made better sense, in my opinion, and they could've gotten creative and tried to mirror the megastars of the past. How about using Jason Momoa to take the mantel of the large and physically impressive Arnold Schwarzenegger? He did star in the remake of Conan. They could've even included a joke where Arnie asks him something along the lines of, ""are you trying to replace me, or something?"" What about Tony Jaa? He is probably the next great Asian martial artist in the style of Jet Li or Jackie Chan. How about bring him in? I actually loved the idea of Ronda Rousey. Her acting chops are better than Gina Carano's and she represents a new age where women might have a chance at becoming legitimate action heroes. Who's the next Jason Statham or Wesley Snipes (action hero with more of a kickboxing flare)? Honestly, it might be Taylor Lautner. The dude is an absolutely insanely talented martial artist. Why not give him a go? As for the guy who effectively replaces Sly, I think Taylor Kitsch is twice the actor Kellen Lutz is, but Lutz did a decent job so I can't complain there. That being said, doesn't a line up of Kitsch, Momoa, Jaa, and Lautner sound better than Lutz, Victor Ortiz, and Glen Powell? I also must point out that I miss Mickey Rourke's character. He has been absent in these last two and I don't get why. Were there fun explosions and gun battles? Certainly. Was there any real substance beyond that though? Not really.",The Expendables 3
147,Spideyfan-963-246215,The Expendables 3,2,6 September 2016,"The Expendables 3(2014) Starring: Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews, Wesley Snipes, Antonio Banderas, Harrison Ford, Kelsey Grammar, Mel Gibson and Arnold Schwarzenegger. Directed By: Patrick Hughes Review I never thought that going boom, boom, boom and bang would be so boring with these guys. It's your standard action flick but not at all memorable or worth mentioning when saying the names of such great action stars. If you want to see a good action flick starring any of these great action stars watch one of their old action flicks you may have. You will be bored with this. It's the same the same thing as the last expendables movie good guys vs. bad guys, no plot what so ever but there was no fun to back that up. This time around they got Mel Gibson as the villain who was one of the expendables until presumed dead and I guess wants revenge. You should not waste your time with this boring video game gun fest. Half the time I felt like I was cinematic for a video game. They even make a new expendables team which could of worked had everyone done a lot more in the end then what I expected. I mean you get all ten heroic badasses and only six of them are doing cool stuff. What mostly disappoints is that they were some of my favorites like Arnold, Ford, and Li. Which sucks. Much like the first two has an awesome all star action cast, tons of explosions, but the problem is that it's two hours long and doesn't deliver the potential goods from everyone. I give The Expendables 3 a two out of five.",The Expendables 3
148,monkeysgalore,"Captures the Franchise's Spirt, and Has an Abundance of Blood-less, But Excessive, Violence",10,27 April 2020,"Yes, it's rated PG-13, and yes it's the least-liked of the three, but I for one, thought it was on par with the other two films in the series.Unlike many people, I don't need my action movies to be sadistic and bloody to enjoy them. I don't need people to be blown up, I don't need to see severed limbs and fountains of blood. I just don't need graphic violence. Sure it can be entertaining, in a morbid way, and sure it's an important ingredient in an action film. But action movies don't need that to still work and be fun. There are many great examples of PG-13 action films that excelled with little strong violence. Taken (2008), any of the post-The Living Daylights (1987) Bond films, the Bourne films, and Live Free or Die Hard (2007), to name a few. Granted, the old-school hardcore 80s and 90s violent action vibe was an attraction of this series, but it's still there. The set-pieces are just as big, the action is almost as brutal and just as entertaining, and the performances are still strong. A movie doesn't need to be a gritty hard R to be fun.Everyone is back from the first film, well, most everyone, with mostly solid performances from the regulars, and some ok performances from the young newcomers. Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Statham, Crews, Couture, and Lundgren are all good as usual. Jet Li has more screen time than he did in the previous film, but he doesn't have very much time to show off his martial arts skills. Schwarzenegger has almost as much to do as the previous film, and he still kills bad guys and makes fun of himself well, even saying ""get to da choppa"" at one point. Part of the novelty of the series are the new cast members every movie, and this one doesn't disappoint. We have Wesley Snipes and Antonio Banderas, who steal most of the scenes they're in, and it was really cool to see Snipes in action again, and Banderas too. Harrison Ford replaces Bruce Willis as the team's CIA liaison, and is brings a certain level of class to the film. Mel Gibson, though, totally steals the show as the psychotic and memorable villain, and he may be the best of the series' antagonists. The young new members are ok, though they're not nearly as interesting as the older guys, and Rhonda Rousey is actually the most memorable of the new recruits.Patrick Hughes, a no-name up-and-comer in the directorial department, actually proves his mettle, crafting some great action sequences. The opening train scene was entertaining, the Somali car chase/shootout was crazy, and the final battle is pretty much about 30 minutes of non-stop, crazy action, with lots of fighting, explosions, and gunfire, and a crazy motorcycle stunt. Seriously the final sequence is great. It's pretty much The Expendables vs. a small army, and there are even tanks here. The final fight is brutal and visceral, and very entertaining, though it probably could have gone on for longer. Hughes is definitely a keeper, going on to do The Hitman's Bodyguard (2017), another favorite of mine. He's the closest thing we have to the new Michael Bay.If you can appreciate a fun PG-13 action flick, than this is for you. The scale of the acton is still there, and the movie does manage to maintain a little of the franchise's grit. Star charisma and creative vision completely drive this thing, and it's quite a spectacle.Actors I'd like to see in the fourth film: Kurt Russell, Steven Seagal, Jackie Chan",The Expendables 3
149,varghesejunior,Mind blowing but mindless work,5,1 September 2014,"This is just not comparable to expendables 1 our 2. The makers have tried to put in top and talented actors in this flick which has just turned out to be something like many ingredients in a cake that had not even been mixed properly, without any sugar.Barney Ross goes on a mission to rescue old comrade Doc and soon finds that an ex expendable and war criminal stone is still in the prowl, and Barney takes it on himself to eliminate stone, even if it means excluding his old team and bringing in a new one.Main credit should go to Gibson and Stallone as their work is remarkable. Most actors have acted as though they're just doing what they're told to do. There's hardly any expression on their faces when they come in, especially Gibson. Arnold had a haggard role, completely off terminator. The film pays tribute to old time blockbusters like Rambo 3, and it seems to be heavily Bollywood inspired - gunfire, fist fight, explosions...see it and you'll know. Sometimes I think it's like a video game; eliminate, rescue, eliminate, bomb, gun, bang bang...LOLThe film does open with a promising start, with good music and action but then you see it's mostly all bullets and bombs. I found the intro of expendables 2 better than 1, and the outro of 1 better than 2. The one has immense action scenes throughout, but all Mindless...There were only 10 prior on the multiplex theatre of 500 capacity.Action fans may love this film",The Expendables 3
150,achyutaghosh,guts and glory made boring!,6,24 August 2014,"Expendables 2 should have been full stop but no- the literally and figurative never say die geriatric bunch is back again, continuing what they started in 2 ie- destroying, in fine style any semblance of respect and appreciation that folks might have had for their past, solo outings. The first Expendables might have been termed honest- a bid for yesteryear superstars to relive their past. The third effort is like the men in them- tired, haggard and bored.It starts pretty well though- Barney Ross and his team of ancient mercenaries bust former member of the team, Doctor Death (Wesley Snipes) from a moving train. You think this was the mission, but no, it is just a starting move. Ross requires Wesley's help in another operation, where he has to stop some arms being delivered to Somalian warlords. The ensuing combat results in a decisive retreat for the Expendables and potentially fatal injuries for Caesar (Terry Crews), as they come up against a founding member of the team- Conrad Stonebanks (Mel Gibson). Stallone shocked, Gibson rocked. At this point it is safe to assume every action star is, was or will be a member of the Expendables. Barney promptly leaves his team, blaming himself for Caesar's injury, and to take down Stonebanks, he assembles a new team of Expendables who he is not that attached to. Kind of strange given that these guys destroy armies for breakfast, so one of them getting injured should be acceptable. Anyways, Barney has been known to be the emotional one, and sadly so because Stallone is so bad at it. The team includes ex marine and maniac on a bike Smilee (Kellan Lutz), club bouncer and real life MMA star Luna (Ronda Rousey), tech expert Thorn (Glenn Powell) and weapons expert Mars (Victor Ortiz). Needless to say, the new team sucks, and the old guard must once again step up in a spectacularly long and over-drawn climax in an abandoned East European city.Expendables 2 was over emotional, they said. Solution- let us dial that back and put in even more action. Fair enough point, and well executed in 3. The action quality is pretty good, old school, but hurriedly shot. Expendables is all about old guys. Solution- let us put in some youngsters. Bad move. An even crowded character-scape means everybody getting approximately 5 minutes of screen-time. So it is all about an entry, a few wisecracks, shoot, stab, boom and then you are gone. Ortiz is a boxing champ who does not get to throw a single punch, Arnold has a hangdog role, Jet Li is relegated to a fleeting appearance, and my favorite in the gang- Dolph hardly gets a word in. Most of the names were a waste, and I think Stallone would have been better served with a plot where his team is getting exterminated one by one, instead of adding 10 more names to the roster.Antonio Banderas as Galgo is about the only good thing that is new in 3. Crazy, over the top, and a motormouth, he is different from the universally laconic character that the rest of the team exhibit. A good actor makes a great villain- Gibson real life antics have ensured that he is Hollywood's most favorite villain today, and he is milking it well enough. However come what may, one man can simply not stand against these aging but still weapons of mass destruction.Maybe I have high expectations, but as a movie though, Expendable 3 just does not pass muster. The earlier ones had R-rated violence at-least, but this one is just another PG-13 action flick. More guns, more action, more explosions and more stars, but no fun. 6/10",The Expendables 3
151,abouhelier-r,The expendables 3,6,21 August 2014,"The Expendables 3 Barney augments his team with new blood for a personal battle: to take down Conrad Stonebanks, the Expendables co-founder and notorious arms trader who is hell bent on wiping out Barney and every single one of his associates. I'm not what you can call a HUGE fan of action movies, but I've watched many of them and I loved watching Sly and Schwarzenegger kicking asses. I miss those movies back to the old days when all The Expendables stars were in the 80's and were all self delusional ego maniac who took everything seriously which sometimes overcame their ""crappy"" acting. Their god complexes gave us some great performances because they believed in themselves so much. However now, The Expendables 3 movie is all cheesy, with a bunch of big jokes. They have become the Scary Movie of action movies, parodying on themselves. At the beginning there are some kick ass action scenes which establish what the movie is going to be and then wipe out this bunch of old guys who prepared themselves to fight together like in the 80's. All gone. This time Stallone welcome new guys on board, a bigger cast with a far better story, all of this displaying us a more complete picture than the former films. The film does take a little more time with characters in order to build them up a bit. They managed to combined what they haven't done yet and what we wanted to see i-e comedy is there, the action is there and the big faces are there. In fact as usual, there are a lot of guns, actions and explosions all in one movie. The good thing is that all stars are different as they bring a different flavor to the movie which ad some valour to the final product. It makes it be more appealing. This movie is not perfect. Nevertheless it has so much potential. Some good things could have been done if they were handled correctly. Unfortunately in The Expendables 3 not so much. In this film they're all aware of their silliness and making fun of themselves, they have to play a character, not a parody. Plus, they could have take the easy way, getting a real bad guy, an iconic villain that we've already hated in movies. Yet they chose Mel Gibson who is obviously a good guy in the movie universe. This is a real challenge for him as he has to made the bad guy believable and at the same time sympathetic somehow. Mel Gibson really is pretty damn good in the movie. If we're being honest it's easy to compare talents when you take an actor of his level and put him in the middle of wrestlers, bodybuilders and Stallone. THAT'S ACTING! He has a truly great scene in which he explains why he is the way he is. I wanted the rest of the film to be like that. This is a hint of what The Expendables franchise could be if they try to be serious and not only a parody of their forms. Harrison Ford is replacing Bruce Willis as a CIA agent in lazy cameo. Antonio Banderas' character is 50/50; whether you like him and think he is hilarious or annoying as hell. I think that those younger guys go against the entire concept of The Expendables. One younger mind is OK. Bring that computer guy in. He brings some fresh new digital element which is fine. Not everyone on the poster need to be on the film. Finally if you take those people, focus on character who worth focusing on and make it interesting, don't just make a bunch of jokes from you former career, The Expendables would be 300% more entertaining that it already is. It's good, I'm not going for realistic action and logic, I'm not even going to this movie for believable characters. I'm going for bullet action, old bad asses and cheeky references to their old movies (eventually). You have to leave logic out the door for this film: helicopters don't move like that, people don't live through that, and they can't physically do that. Overall The Expendables 3 is an entertaining film but also boring film at time, with a very good villain and few good action sequences for the most part.",The Expendables 3
152,The_Phantom_Projectionist,"""Hard as it is to hear, we're not the future anymore""",6,22 September 2015,"The DVD cover of THE EXPENDABLES 3 – featuring the cast grinning jovially at the novelty of their being in the same movie – almost turned me off seeing this film, out of apprehension that the self-parody would be too overt. Rest assured, this is not the case and the movie takes itself no more or less seriously than its predecessors. Nevertheless, EXPENDABLES 3 not as good as either of them. THE EXPENDABLES had a good story and THE EXPENDABLES 2 featured superior action, but the third installment regresses back towards the average on both accounts. To be certain, it still manages to have fun with its cast and has some definite adrenaline moments, but whereas the first two are required viewing for mainstream action fans, this one is thoroughly in the take-it-or-leave-it camp.The story: When the Expendables are targeted by a returning enemy (Mel Gibson), Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) retires his old team so as to launch a revenge mission with the aid of some new recruits.The vast majority of the original cast members remain, and Stallone adds several ""new"" action seniors to his ensemble in addition to Gibson: Harrison Ford, Wesley Snipes, and Antonio Banderas can officially be checked off your private ""Who Should Be in the Next EXPENDABLES Movie"" list. All of them get a chance to shine, and perhaps the biggest triumph of the film is that all of these characters find time to put their addictive personalities forth. Disappointingly, I can't really say the same for the younger additions to the cast, which include MMA lord Ronda Rousey, world boxing champ Victor Ortiz, TWILIGHT series veteran Kellan Lutz, andsome fellow called Glenn Powell. Though they too have some moments and Rousey contributes strongly to the action content, their presence largely homogenizes what should have been a novel movie, with the scenes featuring only Stallone and his new team looking like any old generic action-thriller. Why the filmmakers made room for these guys instead of trying to convince Sigourney Weaver, Chow Yun-Fat, and Michelle Yeoh to be in the picture is something I might never know the answer to.The action scenes are big and bombastic – exactly what one would expect. There are a ton of large-scale shootouts, a couple cool chases, with more than a few eye-catching stunts. The film suffers from some weak CGI, but not so much that it ruins the helicopter dogfight or the car chase wherein Terry Crewes lands a boat on the back of Stallone's truck. Kellan Lutz's vertical motorcycle jump is audaciously cool. However, I was disappointed by the reduced hand-to-hand content, which is largely segregated to the film's final quarter. Some of this has to do with the marginalized role of Jet Li and the underutilization of Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture and Victor Ortiz (none of them fight at all). Wesley Snipes only has a couple of fleeting exchanges, and even Jason Statham demonstrates a lot less knife-slinging this time around. The eventual Stallone/Gibson slugfest is appealing enough, despite the obviousness of their stunt doubles. Ronda Rousey's fights are the most promising, leading me to hope that she lands some starring roles soon. What bothers me immensely is the almost complete dearth of ""versus"" situations between stars: Stallone versus Gibson is the best we get, and none of the other performers are placed directly at odds along the lines of Lundgren/Li and Statham/Adkins from the previous movies.My least favorite part of those preceding films – the nonstop banter and glad-handing between the stars – is back in full force, but it's balanced out by some decent organic humor and amusing characterizations (gotta love Banderas). This rounds off what amounts to an entertaining feature that will nevertheless struggle to be anyone's favorite of the series. It's cool that Stallone tried something a little different with this one, but honestly, it sometimes feels as though the filmmakers were trying to make an EXPENDABLES movie for people who aren't fans of the series. Make what you will of this, but don't expect it to blow your mind.",The Expendables 3

154,chappywatched,Chappy Watched: The Expendables Trilogy,5,10 May 2016,"First of all, if you go into this film expecting anything but a slapstick look at all the old action heroes, well you will severely disappointed.You have your core group of 6 characters that are the main group (Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Jet Li, Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews and Randy Couture) and then after that, every movie, is more like a game of spot the celebrity.The highlight of celebrity appearances would by far have to be Chuck Norris, complete with his own background music – all that was missing was the tumbleweed blowing across the street!All 3 films are full of puns, quotes and jokes about some of the past works of the actors.The first Expendables has too much story and drama and not a lot of action until the end of the film. Expendables 2 was the best out of the trilogy, starts the action straight away and Expendables 3 was probably the worst out of the three.The third film seemed more like a casting video, with Stallone travelling around and getting new, younger people for his team. I also found some of the scenes, especially with Mel Gibson, didn't need to be in the movie and wasn't necessary to the storyline including his character buying art and walking up the stairs to his house.All three films are worth at least a watch once; with #2 being the only one I would watch again.",The Expendables 3
155,priyantha-bandara,The worst of the sequel,3,1 November 2014,"It would be bold and OK to say that after two consecutively engaging and improving sequels, Expendables has screwed up bad this time. This movie looks like it's out of place and going nowhere and a huge potential of acting, bullets and explosives are flat out wasted.The tattooed bad ass underground private soldier gang Expendables is back and they are facing a known enemy from the past. Barney (Stallone) decides to recruit young blood for the last battle saying adios to his old gang and it turns out to be a bad idea. Facing Conrad Stonebanks (Gibson) is trickier and tougher than it seems and Expendables patience and talents tested to the brim.So why exactly this movie did went wrong? It is definitely not the cast and not the action because both of them have more than enough vibe to pull off some awesome movie. I think where it fails is the poor story line which has many connectivity issues and weak flow compared to the previous movies. It feels like some cast is not given a fair chance to perform and their presence is just a mere hallucination of the fact that Expendables is has many old school heroes in one place. This was common in pervious movies as well but the plot and direction was smooth enough for the fans to positively accept it. The only refreshing addition that worth witnessing is Mel Gibson where he brings in some true spark to the dull story line.Talking of the good Expendables 3 is a high octane action jump start right from the beginning. The action is almost 90% far-fetched but we all know the drill here. So there is nothing I can complain about it. Action sequences, cast and set creations are good. The whole movie sees no lush greens or hope of a blue planet but takes place entirely in dull, harsh environments except for the night club and city scenes. There are enough destructions and explosions corner to corner and some really good witty one liners. And Arnold finally wants everyone to GET TO THE CHOPPAH!",The Expendables 3

There are too many characters that are undeveloped, and so we don't care about most of them (the original members are sort of safe, as fans already have an attachment to them); the editing seems like it was done by a film student; it's rated PG-13 (so we get that corny, 1990s style James Bond violence); the action sequences are incoherent and so over the top that they can't be taken seriously, and therefore the audience has no emotional connection to them because you get the feeling that no Expendable will be killed off; and many characters doing things that make no sense. Oh, there is somewhat of a story here: The Expendables are hired to capture an arms dealer, things go bad, and many characters say lots of bad inside jokes that puts this movie into the comedy genre. Lots of wasted money and talent, and lots of disappointed 1980s/1990s action movie fans like me. My most memorable, movie moment of ""The Expendables 3"" is the scene when Mel Gibson (playing the lead bad guy) explains to Sylvester Stallone why Gibson became the way he is. It's the only well acted scene that gave this movie any real depth.Mannysmemorablemoviemoments",The Expendables 3
157,azanti0029,"When there is no element of risk or jeopardy in a movie, any action scene becomes pointless and that's this film - pointless.",1,14 August 2014,"I was not enamoured with the first Expendables film, being as it was somewhat mediocre but with action scenes that simply did not make sense, as I heard the second one was worse I didn't bother with it. The third looked promising, but was sadly a massive let down in every department. Stallone must take the blame for this total waste of time - Once we realise that apart from one character who is injured at the beginning that no one is actually going to die, all element of risk is eliminated from the action scenes therefore making them all entirely pointless. Stallone and his cohorts would do well to sit down and watch the original THE WILD GEESE, so see how real character, tension and drama can be created, but clearly they don't want to kill anyone off in case they get to make a fourth film and don't want the risk of not being able to bring anyone back for another round.The plot such as it is involves the group going on a mission during which one of their number gets badly injured by an old adversary (Mel Gibson, playing himself as far as one can tell) this scene is so staged that it feels completely unnatural and you can see it coming. Stallone decides he's going after him but doesn't want to put his old team at risk, so invites a group of newbies to join his squad, only Antonio Banderas redeems himself here as the mercenary no one wants to hire, everyone else is so forgettable. The mission goes wrong so the old guys come back to save the day. This flimsy plot wouldn't be so bad if it wasn't for the fact that its very clear that no one else is going to die, once you realise this the film loses all sense of drama. Yes its a comic book action fantasy but so is Indiana Jones, and in that you always sense Indy is actually in danger that he might not make it out. Here the whole end fight is just totally pointless. Lines like Arnies 'Get to da chopper' fall flat in badly edited scenes where as others have said the fx work is clearly below par. Seriously, pay a good script writer next time and actually have a set up that is believable where some people actually get killed, then the film might actually live up to its title.

158,craig-hopton,Impressive ensemble cast,6,9 December 2015,"The Expendables 3 is very similar to The Expendables 2. It's filled with plenty of full throttle ensemble action scenes that are completely unrealistic but quite wonderful.This could get a little boring, but the Expendables series' answer to that is simple - just throw more big names into the cast. This movie adds Harrison Ford, Antonio Banderas, Mel Gibson and Wesley Snipes into the fray. Which is on top of the usual Stallone/Statham/Schwarzenegger mix. Oh, and there's a heap of new up-and- coming young action stars that make up Stallone's 'new' team.With a cast like that, the only problem is finding enough dialogue to give all the characters a part to play. As a result, there is a tad less time for action than Expendables 2. This is not a serious movie by any stretch of the imagination but I liked it.",The Expendables 3

It has just about every actor who has ever done a major action flick in it. I thought it was OK. It has one of the longest fight scenes in any movie I've ever seen and the fight choreography is done well but I think the thing that mars it a bit is that the entire scenario is maybe a bit far fetched. I guess people don't go to see these types of movies for their documentary appeal anyway. I think we are living in an age where people are judged to be 'not really adults' based on liking movies like this. If someone likes to watch Fassbinder & Godard films they're judged 'adults.'

162,MUFCOK,Too many negatives,5,3 March 2015,"I feel that the Expendables films as a whole didn't meet their potential and with everything that they had at their disposal they could have made much better movies. The Expendables 3 is the worst of the lot, there is so much to dislike about it but it is not as bad as many of the reviews I have read.I have many gripes with this movie:1) What are the family friendly action scenes about? There is literally next to no blood throughout the entire film and the camera cuts away from the action every time there is any impact. Trying too hard to cater for a younger audience and ruining the movie in the process.2) The new 'young' cast. Why? Why? Why? You have one of the greatest action line ups imaginable and you cut the majority of their screen time for half the movie so Stallone can go gallivanting off on his own to scout new talent to join his team. Not only that but he picks some of the most irritating, pointless characters possible. I honestly do not understand this move at all. The woman alone should never have been included, she is simply awful.3) The Senior Cast. Stallone occupies around 99% of the screen time which is expectable and acceptable but the rest of the cast get pushed aside for the young lot. Jet Li must be laughing all the way to the bank after this. Probably no more than 90 seconds screen time and 2 lines of script and paid an extortionate amount of money. Why not involve him more? The rest of the senior cast are underused for no good reason at all.4) The CGI. Explosions galore, helicopters crashing, buildings collapsing etc. It's all here and it all looks horrific. Mid 90's style effects. Maybe if Stallone hadn't splashed his whole budget on actors that have minimal parts simply to plaster their names across the advertising boards and trailers, he may have had enough dosh to produce believable special effects. Honestly, Terminator looked better.5) Too long and serious. The middle hour or so in the movie dragged far too much. Too much unnecessary script and too much time attempting to build a story which didn't pay off. Nobody is interested in that, the plot is simple and it doesn't need overcomplicating or dragging out.6) The Final fight scene between Stallone and Gibson. I've had longer trips to the toilet, today in fact. It was literally over in an instant! It's as if they simply couldn't be bothered, a couple of lines of forced clichéd dialogue and a short fight. Done. Until about 80 minutes into this movie I was ready to give it a 3/10. The final 35-40 minutes however were very entertaining. The climax scene, the action finale was very fun and well made, it wasn't perfect as it still had the family friendly no blood, minimal swearing and dated special effects but it was a massive improvement on the first 80 minutes. The setting was good, an old abandoned tower block, there were plenty of guns, helicopters, tanks and stunt bikes with great pacing and camera work. Mel Gibson proves he can still act, Snipes was convincing in the first third of the movie and Antonio Banderes was a refreshing addition. Sadly these are the only good points I have to say about the movieIf the movie had been trimmed down 30 odd minutes, decided to not include the new young cast and just had fun with its self rather than be too serious then I would have given it a higher rating. Sadly, the final scenes indicate that there will be an Expendables 4 which will include all the young cast introduced in this movie. 5/10",The Expendables 3
163,tkarlmann,Great film for Action Film folks,9,5 September 2018,"Great effort by the Stellar cast, all! The Critics are sometimes a pain in the posterior. I saw this when it first came out, now again today. It's better the second time. It's nearly non-stop action. Everyone did well, and I had a fun time viewing -- what more do you want?",The Expendables 3
164,DanLives1980,An absolute beast of an action sequel!,7,10 March 2015,"Having followed The Expendables from the beginning, I wasn't surprised by some of the negative feedback despite being wary that the worst criticism most likely came from people who set out simply NOT to like this movie! As a trilogy they're not perfect, not even close, but thanks to Stallone's stubbornness and creative drive, this is a trilogy that ends perfectly, because Expendables 3 has everything 1 & 2 should have worked towards but without trying to outrun their failures as modern action movies.First, EX 3 injected a little more acting into the mix. All it ever took to override the ego was a little better writing and more conviction to our characters. Thanks to the addition of Snipes, Ford, Grammar, Gibson and Banderas, this movie benefits from much better pacing and a great mix of comedy, drama, sly satire and sheer badassery.The trilogy has had no shortage of enjoyable villains in the likes of Steve Austin and Jean-Claude Van Damme but where Van Damme and Stone Cold really tested Sly's physical endurance, Gibson brought out Sly's dramatic spark and brought sheer psychopathic villainy.Banderas was a brilliant addition for comedy effect and really added a lot of energy to the movie, also showing that he could still bring the stunts from classics like 'Desperado' and 'Assassins.' The addition of the new kids, notably Rhonda Rousey and Kellan Lutz at first seemed a bad idea (before I watched the movie) but Sly's strength was that he didn't mess around. He got to business and Rousey, Lutz, Ortiz and Powell followed suit, working on their likability factor as they went along.In terms of modern filmmaking, EX 3 pulls out all the tricks and then some. In non-action scenes it doesn't waste time and there's never a boring moment. There's always something happening or a reference to listen out for. Otherwise you have to listen fast and try not to blink and I enjoy that in an action movie. It's well-paced without cutting corners.As for the combat scenes and the myriad of stunts this movie pulls out of the bag. It's like a raffle where every number is a winner. This is what every Expendables movie should have aimed for, yet I'm now happy that I waited for it. If you think the others were nearing ten on the scale of violent to ridiculous, this one goes up to eleven.Yes, these movies have been ultra-violent from the outset, but this lacks the over-used CGI, most of the stunts are as old-school as the action stars, and the cherry on top...Every Expendable making it through to the final battle going up against an army of what must have consisted of at least half a thousand soldiers. Never mind that you'll never see another action movie like this, minus the gore, this makes 'Black Hawk Down' look like a cab ride across northwest London. Each and every character pulling out all the stops in their own signature combat fashion.The movie is full of free running/parkour, vehicular mayhem, motorcycle stunts, MMA, knife fighting, you name it. Put the Expendables in a building surrounded by tanks and teeming with battalions of the enemy and you have the US version of Battle Royale: Requiem, just without the infinite bullets. It tries its best to keep it real.It isn't ""The Raid 2"" levels of fighting, but this is one of the most insane action movies you're likely to see it. If you don't want that sort of thing, don't complain if you end up seeing it!",The Expendables 3

So it took me some talking into to watch the third film in this franchise and maybe because of my low expectations in addition to the film being rated PG-13, I thoroughly enjoyed it.The action is constant and a little ridiculous but that was expected. What surprised me the most was the comedic presence of all the actors involved. Little gimmicks and inside jokes made the film ten times better than it would've been without them. Antonio Banderas brings the most comedic performance and had me laughing quite a lot while on screen.This won't win any acting awards or special fx awards but it was entertaining and if you're a fan of the first 2 you will enjoy this one. Don't expect much hand to hand combat though, it was mostly shootouts with guns, etc. But it was 2 hours of fun and that's all you look for in a movie like this.",The Expendables 3

As the previous films, the technical result is nothing excellent: an hard rock action movie in 80s style, quite stereotypical but finally not so bad.I taught that after the second chapter there wasn't more to say. Instead this movie calls another question, that is the exchange between old and young characters (actors), revealing that the real plot of the film is meta-cinematographical and is focused on the reaction between characters and actors, how this two natures can juxtapose themself each other and coexist.In conclusion, a normal action movie full, mainstream and all explosions, but with some interesting technical questions that can exorcise the risk of a giant and chaotic group of Hollywood stars.

169,vistheindian,Get Fizzled Down!,6,17 August 2014,"Quickie Review:Conrad Stonebanks (Mel Gibson) co-founder of The Expendables and ex-partner of Barney (Sylvester Stallone) is found to be still alive after the supposed death years ago. Now Conrad is hell-bent on destroying what he created and seek revenge on The Expendables. Barney with his new recruits and old warrior brothers plans to take down Conrad once and for all. This movie is meant for the people who grew up loving the 80s action flicks, and want to see all their action heroes kick ass once more. While in some instances the movie does deliver on its promise, there are certainly times where it fails do so. Ultimately the movie doesn't reach its fullest potential on catering that nostalgia. As result it is at best a guilty pleasure that redeems itself slightly near the end.Full Review:Let's be real here. I know (as do you) that this franchise isn't going for the Oscars. So of course, I'm not expecting to be reveling in the acting talent or deep storytelling. All that I wanted from this was the feeling of watching the 80s action classics. Although that aspect is there, it is also missing for another large part of the movie.I should first mention that there are few redeeming qualities that I must note. One of the best things about this movie is Mel Gibson. He was a threatening villain and really made it look like our heroes were going up against a juggernaut. The cheesy one-liners are deliciously awesome and throw backs to their classics brought a smile to my face. The action was over the top and I didn't mind throwing my logic aside to enjoy the absurdity. The last showdown is also well shot and choreographed. Thankfully all of this helped me from not completely hating on the movie, but there are definitely things that irked me.If you look at the poster, it is filled with people. Some would say it's overcrowded, and that's exactly what the movie felt like for me. Most of the audience is there to watch our older action stars, likes of Rambo, Transporter, Terminator, Blade, Ivan Drago, etc. See they are so iconic that I don't even need to say the actor names and you know who I'm talking about. But then the filmmakers decided to add ""young blood"" with Ronda Rousey, Kellan Lutz, and Victor Ortiz, who take up more than third of the movie. We don't want to see that! Bring back the others, I want to see the older stars interact. Actually those are the moments where the movie shines. By overcrowding the cast that left less screen time for the actors we actually came to see.Another problem I had is with the decision to make the movie PG-13 rather than R-rated. For those who don't know, PG-13 means no blood can be shown in the movie. Now for some people that may seem like nit-picking but it really isn't and I'll explain why. An all-out action film without blood is like a burger without bacon. Sure the burger might be decent, but with bacon it's heavenly! The ultra-violence is part of the 80s action, so ridding it completely rids the movie of its character. A large part of the nostalgia (which this franchise is depending on) is just gone.So there are elements that you might find fun and entertainment. But I just can't shake this feeling that The Expendables 3 could have been much more epic. To sum up, I'm not mad, I'm just disappointed.Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/",The Expendables 3
170,CowherPowerForever,Snipes. Gibson. Ford. Banderas. Grammar. Davi.,7,15 August 2014,"Even more legends grace the screen one more time for The Expendables 3. Just like the two prior films, the action is fantastic, the one liners are fun, and its overall an amazing joyride. With new younger actors(and some non actors) taking bigger roles some may get upset. Need not worry, the attention is still on the characters we have come to love over the decades. This is my review of The Expendables 3.Not only does Sylvester Stallone take part once again in writing the script but, he adds newer stars of the action genre, Creighton Rothenberger and Katrin Benedikt. Rothenberger and Benedikt(actually married to each other by the way) both wrote the smash 2013 action film, Olympus Has Fallen. To be honest going into the film I knew there was going to be a lot of downtime because the runtime comes in at just over two hours. However, the entire franchise has lent itself to this problem, and of the three films so far, Expendables 3 takes the cake for biggest downtime. This can be a problem for some but, I thought the characters and the progression was nice. Having actors like Harrison Ford, Mel Gibson, and Antonio Banderas fill that time makes it worth sticking through. While the story takes a good bit to introduce the newer characters it leads to some fantastic action scenes and an overall fantastic time at the movie theater. The one liners are good in number and will leave big action fans laughing each time one comes out. Stallone, Rothenberger, and Benedikt deserve some good credit for writing a fantastic action movie for us 80s/90s action fans, and I give them a good grade.This time around the film is directed by Patrick Hughes, who recently directed Red Hill in 2010. While I have never seen this movie, it apparently is a nice action movie. While I cannot speak of his previous work, I can say he does a fantastic job. While not the best outing in terms of directing in this franchise, the action scenes are fluid and he really takes control when there is a lot going on in some of the more massive scenes. I personally love over the top action in films like this, and towards the beginning of the film something so over the top happens that you will be talking about it for some time after you left the theater. It was that amazing. To trim down on the budget, you could tell more CG was use. I am not a fan of a big CG fest in my action movies. Thankfully the CG only comes in spots here and there, nothing harmful. Now onto these amazing actors. New additions to the franchise are Harrison Ford, Mel Gibson, Kesley Grammar, Antonio Banderas, and of course the man himself, Wesley Snipes. After a few years off, he is finally back and better than ever. While I cannot say he dominates the film, there are some very nice action scenes with him. As a huge fan of his action films, I am just glad to see him back on the big screen. Mel Gibson plays the bad guy in this film, and frankly does an amazing job. While I would have rather seen him play a good guy, he easily is the most well rounded villain of the franchise. Younger actors who were added to the casting this time around are Glen Powell, Victor Ortiz, Kellan Lutz, and Ronda Rousey. While I cannot say I like the additions of all these younger actors, I cannot say they really hurt the film. Also keep an eye out for one of my favorite actors of all time, Robert Davi, who has an appearance in this film. Overall, in this department, Hughes does a fine job of directing some intense action scenes, and gives us fans something to watch over and over again down the road. He gets a big thumps up in my opinion.Brian Tyler is back for his third outing scoring these films. Just like the previous films, they are good but, nothing special or memorable that us hardcore action fans remember from those great 80s/90s action films. I'm not trying to bring him down at all, he is one of the better composers today, and he gets the job done in this film. He really shines in those high impact action scenes. Tyler gets a good grade from me in scoring of this film.In closing, these films are made for the action fans of the 80s/90s when stars like Stallone and Schwarzenegger were huge. For fans like me, we just get a joy of seeing some amazing action scenes with stars that were on top of the world in the genre just a couple decades ago. For those on the fence, starting out watching the first two films is what I recommend just so you get use to the feel of the franchise. Watching some classic action films as well wouldn't hurt. So, go out there and see this movie, it is well worth it in my opinion.8/10",The Expendables 3

172,The-Social-Introvert,Sums up what's wrong with modern action films,3,24 August 2014,"OK I'm going to try and make this short. I want to write a short review and never bring this movie up again unless it's in an argument of some kind involving PG-13 ratings and violence.Despite knowing what the critics would think little of the film and that mainstream audience were probably still laughing at these 60 year olds wielding M60s The Expendables 3 was actually my most anticipated film of 2014. After aflawed first film and self-parodying (although vastly improved) sequel I, along with Sylvester Stallone, thought that they would finally get it right with the third installment. After all, who needs three movies just to work on the tone of a film?But alas red flags were raised when it was announced that this third Expendables film would be given a PG-13 in America (that's 12a to us folk in the UK). Of course this so that kids would not have to sneak in to see the film in cinemas and they could enjoy watching their heroes tear up bad guys with CG muzzle flash. The action stars own it to the next generation, after all, and it OF COURSE had nothing to do with moneyright?Well, if that was the plan then it seems to have backfired. It's still early days but The Expendables 3's intake already has it labeled a flop. This is in spite of the fact that every decision made by the filmmakers (read: Stallone and Avi) was commercially driven and catered to watering down the movie's brutality in order to ensure a PG-13 rating as I touched on in my article on What the hell has happened to action movies?. And trust me, I've seen Marvel Superhero films more violent than The Expendables 3. And in their obsession in watering down the violence it seems they completely forgot every other aspect of the film. These movies were made so that fans of what is now ancient action cinema could bathe in our nostalgia – they were never going to make bucket loads of cash. The PG-13 announcement has alienated a lot of fans and kids aren't gonna watch it anyway so it looks like a huge blunder from the producers.On order to keep this short and painless for me, I've decided to summaries my points into pros and cons (cons first of course). Here goes.CONSThe young guns – The movie follows The Expendables who, on a mission, discover an old foe once though dead by the name of Stonebanks (Gibson) who shoots Caesar (Crewes) in the ***. Following this, Crewes spends the rest of the film in hospital. After all you can only have one black guy at a time. Despite the fact that we've seen the dog tags of previous expendables and the fact that THEY'RE CALL THE ******* EXPENDABLES Hail Caesar getting Shot in the ass prompts Barney (Stallone) to randomly and quite suddenly disband from his old team. He then spends the next half an hour of the movie drearily recruiting new younger, irritating, and idiotic kids. Here lies the main problem with the film. The Expendables themselves are side-lined for this younger annoying cast who you just want to punch in the ******* face. And they are so whiney and just plain boring. It'd be alright if they were background characters but no. Instead, the people we are paying to see get cameos and these moronic imbeciles (whose characters get themselves caught idiotically) are the main characters. If they brought in anybody with a decent credit in the last few years or had used them in a way so that they weren't spouting sexist remarks or ****** up the room every two minutes I might have warmed up to the. Take a look at how Liam Hemsworth was used in the second film. They were just so boring and irritating I ended up supporting the Mel Gibson's bad guy. At least he turned up to the film and decided he was going to act which is the least I can say for these new mongrel 'action stars'. This major issue ties in and ultimately causes the second problem:My Rating: 3/10Final Word:""What mean 'Expendable'?""""It's likewhen you're invited to a party and don't show upno-one cares.""I'm pretty sure cinema owners are knowing how this feels! This is one of the only times I actually want a film to flop, so that Stallone, Avi, Hollywood and whoever else is responsible don't try and con their loyal audience.Full Review: http://cineranter.wordpress.com/ 2014/08/19/movie-review- the-expendables-3/Also my rant on the decline of action cinema: http://cineranter.wordpress.com/ 2014/08/19/what-the-hell-has-happened- to-action-movies/",The Expendables 3
173,ahegde3149,The more the merrier?! Meh..,3,6 January 2015,"While the 1st Expendable film was very bad, the second one was a slight surprise and enjoyable at times. The sequels will keep on coming to make money until the audience themselves stop going to theaters expecting pure boredom. Which was the feeling I had for almost 90% of this 3rd installment.There is nothing great in the story of any Expendables film, if you are expecting the story to be real good then you are in the wrong zone. I knowthese films are to be enjoyed watching classic old- school action stars beat the hell out of baddies. Still there has to be at least some sense to be made by the script to relate with the cause of action. The film begins with half-an-hour of restless action- sequences filled with train heist, jeep chase, bullets and knives, and what not the regular expendables stuff. Most of the action felt like filler with no reason or intent to anything towards the plot. The thin plot I am talking about involves the character of Mel Gibson who was co-founder of Expendables who went bad and was assumed dead. And he his now back to break the bones of these Expendables. Okay now they need to develop this plot, so the action stops suddenly, and then for an hour we have some kind of no-action time. Wow, it was terrible effort to develop characters. Almost half an hour is spent introducing new recruits into expendables in whom we were not interested. I badly missed the kick-ass group of the previous films, whose screen time is ridiculously reduced. Big stars like Stallone and Statham were part of first 2, here we have more with likes of Harrison Ford joining the gang. But none of their characters were given focus. The biggest problem here, is the Expendables 3 introduces too many characters, which kind of breaks it apart. If they had stuck with same cast as the 2nd film it wouldn't have been that bad. Also it is the longest Expendable film with over 2hr run time which makes it more boring. Their strategy with PG-13 rating for box office success failed as the toning down of rawness really made the action have less impact. There were no fun dialogues as in previous films nor great action. The only thing I liked the most was Brian Taylor's outstanding theme which I will always enjoy no matter what is going on the screen. Overall this was worst film of the franchise so far. Only die-hard fans of the franchise can scrape something out of this one, others can stay away.RATING: [1.5/5]",The Expendables 3
174,clarkmick33,Another Tired Third Film - Just BoRING,3,27 March 2015,"Although I enjoyed the first Expendables film I think someone needs to take a bullet to the series before it starts to turn into SH*T. Someone needs to have the balls to tell S.S to just stop and do something different. The Expendables was done, it had all our favorite 89's heroes, it was cool now just move on to better things. This movie is just dumb even for an reincarnated 80's action flick. The acting just seems to be all about grunting and being angry at each other which is no different really to the other films. For me the ultimate let down was the action. It was just too much well place kicks and shots it all seemed to well planned like I was watching a circus performance rather than being absorbed into the story. There was no sacrifice, no personal struggle just bland action. The final action sequences seemed filmed at a disused mining facility and looked way to obvious that it was a film set.

175,tstudstrup,Bloodless and boring.,1,21 June 2018,"All the oh so grown up movie viewers, that say movies, dont need blood, to be good, are wrong. Especially, in the case of this, now, most likely dead franchise. It starts like the two first movies with a big actionscene. But there is no blood and it feels flat and boring. As does the rest of the movie. I saw the directors cut movie which is longer than the theatrical cut, but still no blood. This so called actionmovie has 50 minutes in the middle of the movie with no action. It has Kelsey Grammar, only known for playing Frasier. He has never been in an actionmovie before, so what the hell is he doing here?? Im guessing actual former actionheroes like Kurt Russell and Michael Biehn turned Sly down. So of course it makes ""perfect"" sense for Sly to turn to a tv actor who used to star in his own show that ended 14 years ago. Mel Gibson and Antonio Banderas are alot of fun. Hrrison Ford gives a solid performance, but like Wesley Snipes, he is wasted here. And the only laugh I had was Gunnar, saying that his mom, used to drive a tank back home in Sweden.All these extra stars, cant make up for a lackluster script and a a bloodless PG13 rating,And then there are the non-stars, The younger team, Barney assembles for no reason at all after firing his own team for no reason at all, One of them looks like a cgi character. I had to watch the opening scene of the second movie, just to remember what was fun about this franchise, It was the blood and guts and the energy among the cast when they still had fun making these movies.

176,YJLcool,A missable film,5,2 September 2014,"Oh my...Look how far it has fallen. The first time was fun. The second one was good. So third time's the charm? Not so much, really. It's gone worse. Before walking into the cinema, we all know that The Expendables franchise is just a bunch of action movies about a group of old action stars get back together to do some old-school action fun, for old time's sake. They're never meant to be taken seriously in the first place. Initially, it's actually quite fun and entertaining to see the each of the actors bringing something to the screen and show us what action is all about.The Expendables 3 has the biggest assembly of action stars in one film, and this time it's a huge mistake to do so. There's just too many of them and none of them are given enough screen time for them to shine. Harrison Ford, Jet Li or Arnold Schwarzenegger only get to appear on screen for a few minutes to do some shooting in the finale and that's it. Rather than adding more character depth to the old Expendables team, the film chooses to introduce a group of young and inexperienced Expendables to capture a dangerous war criminal who controls an army of soldiers, who's also a former highly experienced Expendable as well. As expected, they get easily taken down by the main villain and Barney needs the old team back again to save them. Why bother wasting so much screen time finding and recruiting them in the first place? Just because one of the Expendables got hurt and now they're scared? All of them are hardcore professionals...surely they would know what they have signed up for right?The film repeats the same mistake again by introducing characters to appear without giving them a proper background. The film has no character development at all. They're just there, appearing on screen, do some talking and action then voilà...you have a movie. Please...it's the third one now, don't just tell us about the characters, show us instead. How the original group of Expendables was formed? Why there's a rivalry between Barney and Conrad? How the existing Expendables know each other? There's an entire action scene dedicated to break Wesley Snipes' character out of prison. Why he is there in the first place and needs to be transported by train to another prison?It's actually a big mistake to get rid of the old team much too early in the film. Sure, Antonio Banderas do stand out as the noisy talker who keeps talking non-stop (although it's quite annoying later on); Mel Gibson is menacing enough as the main villain for the Expendables despite doing nothing much in the film (In my opinion, Van Damme is a better villain than Gibson); Wesley Snipes a welcome addition to the crew and his character was quite promising in the beginning of the film. It's rather unfortunate that he got sidelined in favour of the young newcomers. Other than them, all the young Expendables fail to make any strong lasting impression at all. They could have added some interesting, serious banter between the young and old Expendables team. Such a missed opportunity.There's also another problem...the finale. A group of 10 mercenaries trapped in an abandoned building that's filled with C-4 explosives (including 3 in a helicopter) still capable of resisting an entire army of soldiers with heavy artillery, tanks and helicopters without serious damage. Impressive, but not realistic at all.Just like the title of the movie says, most of members of The Expendables are truly expendable. This was shown clearly in the film when Stallone has decided to replace Bruce Willis' role in the franchise to Harrison Ford's Max Drummer due to a disagreement over money for the role.

178,Joejoesan,The best one of the trilogy!,7,7 August 2014,"Yeah, did I make you curious? Of course! The most IMDb reviews want to make you believe that this is the worst action movie ever. Well, I didn't think so. I even dare to say it's the best Expendables movie until now. Okay, the action scenes weren't that great. Once you see one man shooting or fighting, you have seen them all (although the motorcycle stunt was hilariously spectacular). But this time this Expendables outing has humor and a heart and that makes a big difference. Three actors make this movie worth seeing: Wesley Snipes, who gives the first part humor, Antonio Banderas, who does that in the second part, and Mel Gibson, who is actually a great villain. Oh, and before I watched this film I had doubts on the presence of Harrison Ford, whom I didn't see as a gung-ho member of Stallone's macho fight club. Well, actually he isn't. Ford - who's really old in this one - plays Stallone's CIA client that gives him the order to kill Gibson. In the finale he can't resist being part of the action, puts on his helicopter uniform and flies to the scene of the crime.What I very much liked about part III of The Expendables was the logical presence of the actors involved. I remember Chuck Norris suddenly popping up in part 2. That scene seemed pretty forced, only facilitating the idea that the producer had scored another 80s action star. With the exception of Jet Li, who can be seen at the end, all the actors get enough screen time. Even Dolph Lundgren gets his moment.I can imagine the actors having a lot of fun filming this movie. And let's be frank: subconsciously you wonder which actors you want to see in part 4 yourself. Pierce Brosnan has shown interest. Who follows?7/10",The Expendables 3
179,moviescoundrel,Not so Expendable,8,18 August 2014,"Not many surprises here. This one seemed to be a bit lengthier than the last with a bit more story for some reason. While not horrible, not sure if it was needed. The movie starts with a couple of different mission/action scenes. After a brush with mortality (surprise) Barney (Stallone) decides that he does not want to be responsible for the death of any of his Expendables, and does not allow them to continue on missions with him. Cue search scene for new group which turns up a bunch of young newbies and one slightly older assassin (Banderas) which is a very strangely placed part of the story. This 45 minute part of the movie could really have been taken out altogether. The new group gets captured and Barney has to go back with just him and crazy Galgo (Banderas) until the Expendables say, ""no really, we're not letting you leave without us""okayThe rest is pretty predictable. (Hint: the body count probably hits 100, but no more Expendables die) So while the plot and story are predictable and nothing special the part that really worked for me was the cast and the action. The action was the same as the past movies, pretty decent. The last ½ hour was finely orchestrated to weave in and out of hand to hand combat, tanks, helicopters, and motorcycle scenes. The only problem I had was that when you want to see a certain Expendable in action, you may have to wait awhile for the other 20 to get some first. The cast though worked well. The Expendables were made up of the same as before, but the pleasant additions were: Ford (nothing special, but a fine role) Gibson (plays a very appealing bad guy who is fun to watch) Snipes (an uncomplicated guy with some talents, it was nice to see him back on the screen, even if it was simple role) Banderas (a crazy, talkative, assassin with amazing ability). These characters helped make the movie better, and with returning supporting roles from Schwarzenegger, Li, etc., it was a good time had by all.",The Expendables 3
180,georgecoffeynewyorker,Great action flick,9,28 August 2014,"I popped along to see the film. It had come out quite awhile. I was threatening to see it. I eventually got the time to see it. Twas quite good and at time funny. The plot was kinda simple. The Original Expendables: Comprising of: Barney(Stallone), Christmas(Statham), Doc(Snipes), Gunner(Lundgren) etc., They went to get Doc out of prison for Tax AVasion. Then when Casear(Crews) was injured, Barney decided to up the sticks and ""sack"" the old ""Retirees"" as I like to call em. He did so this, as when the fighting was ensuing, Barney saw what he thought was a ghost like figure, Stonebanks(Gibson) of whom, Barney thought he was dead. So Barney went to Bonaparte(Grammar) and decided to have a look around. They encountered Thorn(Powell), Galgo(Banderas), Mars(Ortiz), Luna(Rousey), Smile(Lutz). Oh Smilee was defo a smileee, although he had trouble with Authoritative alrite. Another ""Retiree"" group joined them at the end to kill off Stonebanks. There was talk of that the Drummer character replaced Mr. Church(Willis). Drummer tells Barney that Stonebanks must NOT be killed and be handed over and trialed at the Hague(The Netherlands). So instead Barney at the end kills him. Just before Stonebanks asks him what about the Hague. As in shouldn't I be trialed or whatever. Barney's reply is class. ""I am the Hague"". I think that's fantastic. The Other retiree group consisted of Yin Yang(Li), Drummer(Ford), Trench(Schwarzenegger). So all in all, Great film. I wouldn't put it in for Oscar season let alone Summer's Blockbuster. I wasn't getting that vibe. But great film. I would recommend it. I actually forgot to mention that I was amazed as to how far my home coutnry has come of age. I was the Museum of Modern Art. ANd there's me reading it in Romanaina.

183,marcotiero,Expendables 3: The one with the Rookies.,6,17 June 2020,"The idea of the franchise in one phrase is ""retro-fun"" bring back all the action stars from the past and put the in a movie together, to shoot everything. The stories in these movies are always going to be placed behind the action, which is fine. You don't watch a movie like this for riveting writing, as long as it's passable and not cringe.With this 3rd entry, they kind of lost the way a bit. They decide to replace the main team with boring, 1 dimensional characters who nobody cares about, and for no reason. Take out all the young characters, you still get the same story over 90 minutes instead of 130 minutes with the same result. (Rhonda was the only decent youngster, the boys were all terrible and basically the same character).However, there are some good newcomers to the franchise too. As much as I love Willis, I think Ford is more believable as a CIA guy, and Willis could have been one of the Expendables (he's John Mclane!). Snipes is pretty good as an unhinged guy who has been in captivity for 8 years. Banderas' Galgo is basically like a Spanish Deadpool but is likeable for his enthusiasm, and you feel empathy for him when you find out what happened to his team.Finally, Mel Gibson as the villain is an excellent choice. His delivery in his lines has more conviction and menace than Roberts villain, and he's more charismatic than Van Damme's deadly but pretty dull Vilain (though why did they say he was Australian, only for him to refer to himself as American?). Too bad Robert Davi wasn't in the movie longer, could have maybe had him as Stonebanks partner for the duration.Special mention also to Kelsey Grammar for adding a touch of class as well. Always a pleasure to watch an actor like him who can make the corniest of dialogue sound well written.",The Expendables 3
184,ThatMonkey,Pack a Lunch!,7,15 August 2014,"This series started off with the promise of bring together the legends of action for a hell raising party like never before. Unfortunately poor scripts, bad direction and bad action left this series shorter than a midget on its knees.I applaud Stallone for continuing to find new and young talent for the series, but the Expendables was always plagues by poor execution.This time around, the gang is larger than ever and the stakes higher, but poor casting took the wind out of the sales here. Ronda Rousy has the kinda body that makes teenage boys lock the bathroom door so mommy doesn't know what Tommy is doing to himself in there. However, her body and sexiness is no substitution for acting skills, for which she has none. I would have much rather seen Steven Segal in the Kelsey Grammar role and Kurt Russell in the Harrison Ford role, but so be it, who knows if they were available or interested.In the right hands this could have been an IMDb 250 title, but the script and direction lacked the polish and shine necessary to elevate the film to it's potential. Jason Statham really has been the anchor of this series, but this time I am going to give top honors to Antonio Banderas.The movie is fun, mindless and rewarding, and the best of the series, but they assembled an B+ cast for a C- film.",The Expendables 3

186,j-madej,"""The Expendables"" movies might not be named in the same breath as ROCKY or RAMBO, but in someway represents a continuation of work Stallone for over 30 years now.",7,24 August 2014,"Let me start with a confession that I am a long time admirer of Sylvester Stallone due to the fact that he is a writer, director and an actor. In the world of compartmentation were you should define yourself by what you do, or should I say what you are making your living off, Stallone came in to the Hollywood with a bang and change it all with his big screen acting/screen writing debut ""ROCKY"". He was just a guy that came to Hollywood with a dream largely unknown as an actor and a writer, with hard work and dedication he scratched his way through Hollywood bureaucracy to become one of the most beloved actors of his generation. Now, not all of his movies where an instant classics but with time they added to his legacy. Through the system of building franchises he created many memorable characters like Rocky and Rambo. His new character lead Barney Ross of ""The Expendables"" movies might not be named in the same breath as the other two, but in some way represents a continuation of work Stallone has been chosen for over 30 years ago. ""Barney (Stallone) augments his team with new blood for a personal battle: to take down Conrad Stonebanks (Gibson), the Expendables co-founder and notorious arms trader who is hell bent on wiping out Barney and every SINGLE one of his associates.""After watching the new addition to this franchise ""The Expendables 3"" I must say I had a mixed feelings about it. From previous informations about accidental deaths of two stunt man as well as the fact that the DVD copy has licked to the public before the movie was released you might think that this film was doom to fail. This film represents what I call the class of old, still talented, someway washed up Hollywood, with the new not quite charismatic and special generation that in theory should take over the industry. The problem is that the old guys still kick some serious butt where the young one don't have enough charisma to rule the screen like guys like Stallone or Gibson. It is such a joy to see Mel Gibson on the big screen reminding us that at some point he was the king of the hill as an actor and director. The villain Mel Gibson plays Stonebanks is full of depth and dimension and when Stallone shares the screen with him, we remember the heyday of their careers by reminding us that age is nothing but the number. On the other hand ""The Expendables 3"" has scenes that do not quite work in terms of acting like the scene between Wesley Snipes, Jason Statham and Stallone on the plane were the timing and believability goes away and you see actor struggling to make something out of lines that feel forced and unnatural. The action scene are truly impressive and the scope of the military impute here is immense. Stallone always knew how to make a movie with those big action scenes and this one is no difference. Apart from occasional inconsistency in acting from the younger generation there is a lot of dual depth in the dialog which most viewers will not understand. But, trust me it's there. All in all I enjoyed this installment to this franchise and considering that ""The Expendables 4"" has been announced the fact that this part financially might not make a huge box office will not matter. Stallone will continue his legacy being one of the old school masculine Hollywood stars that must give away place to the more metrosexual generation of today that is less interested in depth of the knowledge but more interested in material possessions and technology. I am proud that I saw Stallone in his prime and I applaud him for opening up Hollywood to the notion that you don't have to be only one thing. You can be whatever you want to be if you put your mind, hard work together with dedication. This film is mostly recommended to those who like strong action cinema with sometimes graphic valiance.

187,jefflouvre-435-77367,The bad 'old' days,5,14 August 2014,"THE excitement of The Expendables series has always been about elderly and mostly white former action stars kicking the ass of dictatorial regimes across the world. The amount of violence and bodies in it provided a visceral thrill to audiences. The plot hardly mattered as there was always some regime in the world that needed to be beaten to pulp by angry Americans.Sylvester Stallone, the creator and the star of the series, plays a former US secret operations soldier who is quick to dispense justice, and to make his character appealing, he has a moral conscience. This theme is prevalent in many violent US films. It's as if the filmmakers are saying that it's okay for Americans to be violent and run roughshod over others, as long as they have a heart of gold.The Expendables 3 follows the path created by the first two films. A bunch of oldies, part of a former group of dark ops agents, is given the task of taking out baddies or saving the world from a crisis of unparalleled proportions.The third film, realising that this formula is wearing old, mixes it up by adding younger killers, and also giving it a much larger role to play in the film.However, the result is always the same: a cacophony of violence and destruction that will give the Transformers series a run for the money.As usual, the killers perform their job with aplomb and with nary a scratch.Read more at: www.jeffleemovies.com/the-expendables-3-old-hand-at-violence/",The Expendables 3

189,janus-20,Sly manages to force the 12A into puberty (probably at gun point).,10,17 August 2014,"I will start by saying this is my least favourite of the Expendables franchise. I thought it seemed a little obvious they'd trimmed the violence and it didn't have the immediacy of pacing the other ones had. Niggles aside, this is still fantastic, machine gun toting, head smashing, building demolishing entertainment. There's no getting away from the site of a helicopter gunship being piloted by Harrison Ford, whilst Arnie and Jet Li man the guns and lay waste to an army, transcends awesome and approaches hitherto undiscovered levels of gung ho nirvana.Mel Gibson makes a great villain, one of the best scenes is his conversation with Barney in the back of the van on the nature of their business. The new Expendables are perfectly good, as far as their involvement goes, but the task they have is to make us like them as much as we have Sly, Arnie, Harrison, Dolph etc over the last thirty years, only they've got two hours to do it in. Tall order.What saves the day here again, as with the other Expendables, is the same thing that elevates these movies above all the CGI, wire-fu, teenage fantasy movies we get every year, purporting to be ""action movies"", legitimacy !! All these guys look, act and have the undeniable pedigree of being real action heroes. They have a history through this type of film and they wear that history on their sleeves in these movies. That's why when they start vaporising the bad guys, it feels more.. legitimate. I hope there's a Expendables 4, as there are a few things they could improve on next time. But for now Expendables 3 is great fun, I mean where else are you going to see Rambo and Frasier drinking in a nightclub?",The Expendables 3

191,Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd,The Expendables 3 Review,6,14 August 2014,"My Thoughts:Where to begin with The Expendables? This franchise never really tries to be something that it is not. You go to this movie expecting over-the-top, high-octane action, and it does not disappoint in the least. Yes, there is the underlying story line, as mentioned in the summary, but who really pays attention to that?Feeling the pressure of time–or maybe age– Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) sacks his old team to spare them from going after Conrad Stonebanks (Mel Gibson). Ross contacts old teammate Bonaparte (Kelsey Grammar) to hire him a new, younger expendable team to help him take out Stonebanks. This, of course, gives us a slight old school/new school mash up. Ross tries schooling the kids in the way he does thing, but, in turn, they teach him how the modern age does it. One of the members also schools Ross in what the word ""family"" really means.Expendables is always a hard movie to review because if I go into it trying to apply the real world to it, this movie would fall apart and be a piece of crap. The story line sucks. There really isn't any character development. And with all of the bullets flying around, explosions going off, and shrapnel flying in the air, everyone in this movie should be dead a million times over. But we don't go into these types of movies and expect real world logic. We are going into these types of movies wanting the 1980s action flick that most of us have grown up on, and they deliver time and time again.It does seem like they are breaking format or at least setting it up so that way the Expendables Franchise can continue with a younger cast of up and coming action stars. This is not a bad thing, it is always good to see a franchise that is looking towards its future and keeping the brand going forward.My Recommendation:If you are a lover of over-the-top action, weak story line, or just loved the first two movies, then you will want to see this one in theaters.",The Expendables 3
192,CrisMovieCorner,Another enjoyable instalment in a fun franchise.,8,24 August 2014,"Let me just start off by saying all you people who are saying ""this film lacks substance"", ""no character development"" or ""just Action porn"". You people need smack upside the head, this film never advertised itself as anything but a pure Action ride popcorn flick. You wouldn't go into ""The Godfather"" and complain there isn't enough Spaceships, so don't go into a popcorn flick expecting an Oscar worthy performance or perfect script! Now that is out the way onto the review.We're back for a third instalment in easily one of my most enjoyable franchises for a long time, I love a full on over the top Action film and The Expendables franchise never fails to deliver in that department. However, this film does come with a 12A certificate which is obvious when you watch it with the lack of actual blood they use, that doesn't mean there is enough over the top violence to enjoy.The film starts off with the the Expendables rescuing a former member Doctor Death (Snipes) after a prolonged spell spent under the capture of some Russians, turns out there is no razors where he was kept because Snipes is rocking a hella beard! Within the first fifteen minutes of the film we get an armoured prison train, helicopters, boats, planes, tankers, jeeps, missiles, guns, knives and explosion that would make an everyday man wet his pants. However the Expendables escaped unscathed, well all but one Caeser (Crews) finds himself left in a critical way after Conrad Stonebankes (Gibson) leaves him that way in his escape.This latest close call has Barney (Stallone) disbanding his near perfect team due to the fear that they're all getting to old. Leaving Barney and his badass companion Bonaparte (Grammer) to race around America and Mexico gathering a new rag tag bunch of younger and possibly even dumber Expendables (Rousey, Ortiz and Powell) however there is one older addition to his crew Galgo (Banderas) and damn does Banderas deliver, his verbal diarrhoea is enough to drive any sane man to tears however some of the stuff he comes out with will leave you in tears of laughter.Overall the film delivers in all the areas you expect from such an Action flick, full of explosions, gunfire, destruction and hilarious one lines one that sticks out is Arnie dropping a ""Get to da choppa!"" retort that made me nearly keel over on the spot. Plus we get a solid performance from Harrison Ford, leaps and bounds better than Bruce Wills' ever gave us. Then we have Mr Mel Gibson who may have just made himself the go to guy for the big dog villain in the future. He is the most deranged, crazy, insane, is there any point? I will run out of superlatives, Mel is phenomenal I can't wait to see him again.I highly recommend this film and I always will, they're just pure Action porn, however what more can you ask for from a film that is purely built around recreating 80s Action nostalgia?

198,ActionFan-Reviews,A Complete Disappointment and Total Letdown,5,8 August 2014,"As someone who grew up on the great 80's/90's action movies and consider many of actor's and their films to be among my favourites, I was really looking forward to the third installment of the expendables series. Stallone, Statham, Snipes, Ford, Schwarzenegger, Gibson all in one movie and this is the best they can do! words can't describe the complete disappointment with the latest movie and it's sad to say but I feel the franchise needs to end.I was looking forward to this movie for all 2014 like I am sure many fans were, until I heard the shocking news that the movie would be PG- 13. Of course, just because a movie is rated R or PG 13 doesn't determine the quality of the movie (Die Hard IV vs V, We know which is better), the fans of this film know what they want and that's blood splattering action, exploding bodies, bone breaking fights and great stunts with no CGI which the first two films had and what made them good for what they were. Yet this has none of that! The action bloodless, sanitized and cut in a way where no blood/gore is shown.The action scenes themselves aren't very memorable in terms of anything that sticks out. It feels very much like you've seen it before but better like in Rambo IV. Other than the rating, the film is over bloated with many forgettable additions. Fans want to see more Li, Crews, Statham, Snipes and Mel Gibson not Frasier or some loser from twilight or some other no names (Excluding Rhonda Rousey because she is hot and kicks ass). I will give the movie points for the addition of Snipes, Ford, Banderas and Gibson. Their presence certainly added to it, including the humour and acting weight and of course seeing Indiana Jones, Blade and Mad Max in action in one movie is pretty awesome . I'm sure fans would of loved to have seen some bone breaking fights with Rhonda Rousey or a brutal, bloody climax between Stallone and Gibson but that was certainly missing that with the PG 13 rating.Overall, The movie could of and should of been a much better, balls to the wall and intense movie like how the previous installments were. I am not the only one I am sure sure to feel utter disappointment and disbelief at how terrible the film is. If you are a core fan who loved the first two films, go back and watch them again because this will leave a bitter taste in your mouth. I remember Stallone saying on his Twitter he will ""outraid The Raid"" and all I have to say is i'm sure for people who've seen both films is that this installment doesn't even come close to matching that movie or of some of other action films out their. In short watch something else!5/10",The Expendables 3

The final fight scene was long, yet there was more than punches. A little high tech gadgetry helped the team along the way.

The story sucks, acting performances are cheap, even the most important thing about this franchise, combat scenes, do not live up to the standard of previous 2 films.Plot is as usual. Mercenaries go to do some dirty business for CIA, end up making things personal. This type of movie doesn't need the actors to act, so they don't. Sound and score don't show any variation. Film editing is low. The only thing I liked is cinematography.The made a lot of changes from the last two movies. And almost all of them make the movie worse. There's no Chuck Norris this time. Bruce Willis is replaced by Harrison Ford (I like Harrison Ford but he is not Bruce Willis). This the first time the main villain is played by a big star (Mel Gibson), and is the only improvement from the previous films. But the change that has hurt most is the gun battles. The Expendables are now using silenced weapon, hacking techniques. There was also old school but not enough. The franchise's trademark is old school combat, big explosions, large guns & knives. Oh and they bring a new expendable team, some cute kids, pretending tough.Finally I'm gonna give some advice, get a better director. Michael Bay may be. And I am getting impatient with Mr. Stallone, where is the new Rambo movie? The name ""Rambo"" weigh more than the entire cast of The Expendable 3.

202,RustyShacklefordd,Third Time Is Not The Charm,4,5 August 2014,"Despite another opportunity, the franchise featuring quite possibly the best cast of action stars once again fails to live up to it's full potential. While most of the gang from the first two films is back, most of the charm is gone in this watered down and weakest installment in the Expendables franchise yet. Before the film was even released, there was a lot of backlash against the PG-13 rating the film revived despite the past two films being rated R. After seeing the film, the backlash is completely deserved. From the opening scene, it's evident that the rating has resulted in choppy edited and watered down action scenes. There is still loads of shootings and stabbings, but the blood is gone and most of the impact takes place off screen. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense when the movie is trying to be a homage to 80's action movies like Rambo and Terminator which were rated R and loaded with graphic violence. But, the biggest flaw of the film is that it's just plain dull. The novelty of seeing all these stars on screen together as worn off and it doesn't help that it feels more like a Mission Impossible film than what it's trying to pay tribute to. To make things even worse, the majority of the Expendables crew is absent for a good amount of the film. Instead, we have Stallone's character throughout the entire second act of the film recruiting a crew of members played by younger no-name actors. This defeats the entire purpose of the film considering it's whole appeal is based on a cast of legendary action stars. Not only do we not care about these characters since they aren't appalling, but they have no dimension or charisma. The only new addition to the team who is recognizable is Antonio Banderas who's only purpose is to serve as cringe-worthy comic relief.Now the film does have a few redeeming factors. First off, Mel Gibson is absolutely fantastic as the villain and steals every scene he is in. There are a few moments of interaction between the crew and are actually enjoyable to watch and the final action scene is pretty good. But, these aren't enough to save the film as a whole. The Expendables 3 is just another reminder that this franchise after three attempts, still has failed to live up to being the ultimate badass action movie we have all hoped for. There's currently a fourth film in development, but if they couldn't get right in three attempts, I highly doubt a fourth one would.",The Expendables 3
203,oldman007,Sometimes you have to take the good with the bad.,6,6 September 2014,"Within seconds from when this film starts, you know you are in for a good ride. Cool characters, witty/corny dialog, explosions and most important of all...A POPCORN FLICK. I will start this film off with the bad notes, because, like everything I do, I always love to leave on a good note! Bad Notes: Putting Jet Li in the movie was completely pointless. He was only in it for 2 mins, he shoots a few bad guys right at the end and that's it. Jet Li is a talented fighter, and he should always be givin' the opportunity to get every fight scene he can get his hands on. Second of all, Kelsey Grammar (mostly famous for Frasier), didn't even have the time to shine. He is setting up Stallone with all these new people Stallone wants to hire for the job, and Grammar just does not get the chance to even hold a gun or even bash a few people. It would have been very interesting to watch! The story doesn't really go anywhere special. You see where this film is going and you can predict the next scene within 5 minutes before it happens. Wesley Snipes needed more screen time, he only punched a few people and that was it, MORE, MORE MORE! Now...Mel Gibson...such a disappointment. He was great as the villain...and he only is given' about 20 minutes of screen time and a 57 second fight with Sylvester Stallone right at the end. Come on, it's Sylvester Stallone (Rocky) VS Mel Gibson (Mad Max), it is the best idea for a fight scene within the last 5 years and they end it in just under a minute? COME ON! Now, the good notes: It's great to see the whole cast together again. And for such a huge cast, they did really well at trying their best to make sure everybody got some screen time. Antonio Banderas was hilarious as the annoying gunman/fighter. He will kill you just by listening to his annoying voice! Most of the humor came from him. We even get to see is cool gun and fighting skills in the final showdown, just brilliant! Harrison Ford even gets to come into the firepower with a helicopter with guns and missiles! Now, the biggest good note of this is Mel Gibson! He was the best choice to play Mr. Stone! he has the most spookiest/most evil face, it would be enough to scare anybody, anywhere! He is definitely been the best villain so far in The Expendables series so far! I doubt we will see a villain this good ever again! And finally, the newcomers of the team. They were all great, considering the fact, for some of them, it was their first movie role.All in all, it is worth seeing, but there needed so much more work to be done! 6/10.",The Expendables 3

It's got one of the most intense combat scenes I've ever seen in a movie. Keep in mind, there's next to no CGI. THIS IS REALLY happening. When things blow up, there actually blown up. It's amazing. I was blown away as I have been with all of the Expendables movies and I wish people would just enjoy the action movie for what it is. A dazzling display of action.All actors performed amazingly and it was great to see Wesley Snipes back and in top form again. Sylvestor did a great job and I really loved how the story has seen a terrific build up. There's depth to the characters now. They have a history together of which we have all shared.If anyone is knocking this movie, they need to get there butts out of a chair and actually go and try to make even a budget action film. I think they will quickly appreciate the time and serious effort that has gone into this amazing film.One of the most legendary action films ever made period. This is only rivaled by it's prequels, The Expendables 1 and 2 which are also magnificent films.Take note, this is not for those who like 'Days Of Our Lives' and films that go on about the story for ever, this is about action and the story is told through the action. Deal with it or go and watch 'Gone With The Wind' or something but don't you dare put forward negative critique where it's definitely not due, because it isn't. This movie deserves high praise and nothing less.GO EXPENDABLES!!!",The Expendables 3
205,tmf084,Really decent action flick,8,17 August 2014,"Don't expect too much and take it for what it is - a high profile summer action flick that's out there to bring you some light entertainment and a bit of nostalgia. The story is simple and filled with tropes but makes sense to a degree where you can buy it and focus on the action sequences and one liners, which are pretty funny. I especially liked that they went for classic action sequences, still with lots of explosions and fight scenes but keeping it tidy enough to not overload the audience - unlike other movies where action scenes start to become just flickering images because they put so much in them and so many dynamic camera movements that you almost start to feel nauseous. Bottom line: If you like 2 hours of mindless entertainment to see the action heroes of the past perform one more time then this is for you - if you look for substance stay clear (but that should go without saying since it's the third installment)",The Expendables 3

Please don't bring your brain to the cinemas. Just enjoy the over-the-top action and almost-brainless plot (if you think there is any in the first place).Ridiculous Scenes There were many scenes which doesn't seem to make (common) sense to me! One will be the black-op mission when the team tried to apprehend some arms dealer. What made me burst out laughing was how they enter the area IN BROAD DAYLIGHT using a speedboat without anyone noticing, they even enter the heavily armed region, climbed on to the containers IN BROAD DAYLIGHT without raising any alarm! How is that even possible?When the ""younger"" expendables were hired, they kinda balance up the retro ""machine-gun shooting"" stunts by introducing some technology stuff. Too bad, the ""Expendables Lite"" wasn't able to pull off their tech-savvy roles well enough. Or should I say, the script seemed to be written by a non-tech person, so much that the ""techy"" part of the film were all briefly touched on.Galgo (Antonio Banderas) If I really have to give someone the credit for the score the Expendables 3 is getting from me, it will be the comical motor-mouthed Galgo. The wannabe mercenary was so irritatingly funny, making everyone else looked boring in contrast. OK fine, Wesley Snipes as Doctor Death was pretty cool (especially his tax evasion pun). Aside from that, Jet Li and Arnold Schwarzenegger are pretty dispensable.Well, I rated this without watching the first two installments, but with the big cast, you might want to catch it just to see them in action together once more.Credits: http://tiffanyyong.com/2014/08/09/expendables-3-movie-review/",The Expendables 3

It's simply bigger and bolder than the first two. The locations are more varied. So is the action. Even the score is better.If it hadn't been for Gibson's superb acting (notice his monologue in the van)and Banderas' hilarious approach to his role, I would probably have thought less of it, though.But enough is enough.

209,Marthian80,Forced PG-13 rating and adding young nobodies doesn't work,4,2 August 2017,"I didn't think much of the first two Expendable movies but I was curious how the next installment of this movie would turn out. The 'PG-13' rating worried me but the addition of Wesley Snipes, Antonio Banderas and Harrison Ford to the team might make up for it.. right? In the opening scene of The Expendables 3 we see the old team (Stallone -> Barney, Lundgren -> Gunner, Statham -> Christmass, Couture -> Road and Crews -> Caesar) on a missions to rescue Doc (Snipes) from a train. Doc is happy to go home but learns from Barney that they're underway to another mission and just needed one more man for the job. Doc agrees however, and the team goes to Somalia to stop an arms dealer unloading some bombs. While the mission goes more or less to plan, Barney is shocked to see that the arms dealer is none other then Stonebanks (Mel Gibson) who he believed was dead. He opens fire on him and jeopardize the mission, forcing the team to withdraw. Stonebanks escapes in a helicopter and has the ability to take the whole team out with a rifle, but decides to only wound Ceasar and then drop a bomb on them which does no damage because they all jump in a river. Back home, a man known as Drummer (Ford), who has taken over from Church, and Trench (Schwarzenegger) push Barney to go back and take Stonebanks out. Barney doesn't want more of his friends to get hurt so he leaves them to go and meet Frasi.., I mean Bonaparte (Grammer) to find fresh blood (and Antonio Banderas) to get killed instead of his old buddies. But will the youngsters be tough enough to take Stonebanks down?While I thought that the second installment was getting better, the third one is a let down again. I don't mind the ridiculous over the top action that this movie is filled with and I like Gibson here, he actually plays a decent villain. There is also no shaky cam which is an improvement in my book. But where it goes wrong is the forced editing to make it PG-13. With so many knife fights, explosions, people flying around and gunfights, it takes a gazillion amount of fast cutting and patching to keep the violence down. And the movie suffers heavily from it, some action scenes are so badly cut it makes my eyes hurt! The other major downside is the inclusion of some random selection of young actors (I have never heard from) who are going to be the ""new"" team? Who thought that was a good idea? And who wanted to see the 'drama' happening when the old guys meet the young guys? I assumed that everyone who watches these movies want to see the old action heroes kicking ass, not some random kids riding around on motorcycles and hacking into security systems... The 'new' old members are decent though, but I'm not sure if Banderas character was a bit to much. The parody part of the movies is getting old as well, hearing Arny saying 'choppa' so often is getting old fast..The Expendables 3 has some decent action scenes and a good villain character but overall it suffers from the forced PG-13 rating and the inclusion of some random young actors that nobody wants to see.",The Expendables 3

211,camille-05424,A very good and entertaining film,8,29 October 2018,"A review written in 2014 by slightly mad 22 highlighted some points this reviewer agrees with. I have now seen all 3 expendable films on DVD. I am an older fan of many if not all the older cast members starting with both Sylvester and Jason. With Expendables 3 the failing of staying with a R rating did lessen the turnout with the fans. Mr. Stallone has publicly made his apologies. If there is a 4th installment I'm sure it will be R rated. However, for me there was enough blood.
The time spent with all the talent in this film and the previous 1 & 2 must be limited due to the time viewers will spend in their seats to watch. Also, in my opinion if more time is spent with the outstanding talent the story would take many turns in the plot. There is just so much time and money for that development.
To point out the best villain I agree is Mr. Gibson. Mr. Banderas gave a great uplifting performance. All the many others of the old cast are great always in their performance in this film and in all their other films. It would be great for a new viewer to spend a weekend and watch all 3. I am sure you would have an entertaining weekend, and that is the business of film making is for viewers to be entertained. I was!

I feel like fans of the first films were tricked into watching this watered down poor excuse for an action movie. Frankly this is not really an action movie. It's a bad bad boring as heck of a movie. Why does Hollywood do this?! They take the things that make a movie series good and replace it with no name, no acting characters. No one cared about the 'new crew' they all could have been killed in the first few scenes and it would not make one iota of a difference to the plot. Throughout this movie, I kept saying What the hockey sticks! There us TOO much talking! Why the pg13 rating?! I am so glad that I did not go see this in a movie theater I would have been royally peed off. Old actions stars kicking ass, blowing things up...That's ALL we want see. This movie tries to take its self way too seriously. When Terry Crews character was shot, I felt something...I said 'Oh No'. When Mel Gibson captured the new crew, I didn't care what so ever about them, actually I was hoping they would all die. That would have been more interesting.",The Expendables 3
213,michael-sengwah,Old School Actions But With Galgo Style Plot,5,16 August 2014,"Learning from the mistakes in The Expendables 2, the cast has reunited in this sequel with a climax that really brings back or nearly close to the old school action thriller just as in the original first film. However, having the Galgo style of plot has dragged the entire film into an unnecessary overlong of 2 hours. While the old cast still brings a lot of fun and maintains the brother love across the trilogy, the introduction of the young Expendables might seems a fresh strategy to develop possible sequels but the poor performance, poor developed screenplay and moderate quality of visual effects have ruined part of the film. At least, it compensates audiences once again with amazing scores from Brian Tyler which enhances the actions scenes but overall, Barney's emotional feelings in this sequel seems to be similar to the boring emotional Iron Man in Iron Man 2.",The Expendables 3

Add to this some snarling, macho posing by a female member of the team and the end result is every bit as bad as you might expect. The female member gets captured, of course, and requires rescuing. Typical girl huh ?Things crawl along at an excruciatingly slow pace for an action movie, as we are introduced to all the new members of the team and their own peculiar skills.Stallones ability to do emotion seems to be matched now by his ability to move his face. At least he's in no danger of being out- acted by the likes of Statham (who has somehow blagged a career in films - despite an inability to vary the gruff whispering hard man character that he always plays).There's a lot of chat along the way with very little in the way of wit with the possible exception of Schwarzenegger who seems to have grasped the ludicrous concept of the whole enterprise. (I may be biased, as I loved his performance in the meerkat ads).Aside from that, it retains very little interest. There's something more than a little grotesque in these very-OAPs pretending to roll about and threaten and intimidate each other. But of course - there is nothing quite grotesque as the bad guy Mel Gibson. As we all know, he really is grotesque .... for real.Give it a miss.",The Expendables 3
215,SforSmile,Yawn!,3,26 August 2014,"Having seen the previous parts I didn't expect much of an intriguing story, just dirty, rough handmade, gun fire action in the style of the 80's blockbuster stunner like ""Rambo III"" and occasionally a cool one-liner here and there, however, this tired, uninspired, unoriginal, dull, undynamic rehash just made me yawn and anticipate the ending so that I could go home.Sylvester Stallone once wrote a good script for ""Rocky"" and now he thinks he can write worthwhile, interesting stories on and on, well, he obviously can't, repeating yourself is one thing but repeating yourself badly without the humor and thrill of the previous works is simply unworthy of the cast consisting of so many action movie legends like Arnold Schwarzenegger, Harrison Ford and the like, and it's certainly unworthy of the ticket price.The new ""younger"" backup for the Expandables-team of bloodless no-names like Viktor Ortiz or Kellan Lutz (who?) which Sly assembled in a boring interlude where he travels around America, which seems to serve no other purpose than stretching the runtime of the movie to unnecessary 127 min. the longest runtime of the series - nevertheless it felt like the movie had less action scenes than before just because of too much talking and standing around - this said new members are just redundant and pose in no way any competition to the original cast in terms of charisma and camera presence. it's ridiculous that half of the movie is about making us believe that this crew is actually supposed to replace the older ones. Ronda Rousey, the first female addition to the team, makes a face as if someone is constantly holding a stinky sock under her nose, at least she makes her stunts all by herself, right? Antonio Banderas is just laughable in his role as ""Galgo"", and I don't mean it in a positive, funny way. It's the kind of humor you will find predominantly in cartoons: childish and silly. It's embarrassing that he let himself pay off for this. Wesley Snipes is good for an entry joke, nothing special.The only redeeming factors are the explosive finale, although devoid of any logic, and surely Mel Gibson's kind of angry performance of the main villain; he clearly enjoys his assigned status of being Hollywood's lunatic number one.""Expandables 3"" is a bad movie, period.",The Expendables 3

This time around, Stallone introduces 4 younger members to his team as well the addition of Wesley Snipes (who paired up extremely well with Stallone and Sandra Bullock in ""Demolition Man""). Overall, I found it as action-packed and enjoyable as the first two but I found Mel Gibson to not be as convincing as the villain as Eric Roberts or Jean Claude Van Damm. Perhaps it's because we tend to associate him too much with the Martin Riggs character in ""Lethal Weapon' or William Wallace in ""Braveheart"". He just didn't seem to come across as the bad guy that well.

219,ZChrisJ1995,A surprisingly dull installment,5,14 August 2014,"Whilst the original ""Expendables"" and its first sequel were unashamedly brainless yet highly entertaining, ""The Expendables 3"" is unfortunately quite a boring and lifeless experience, due to its watered-down, heavily-edited and rarely-used action sequences, and its often uncompelling new characters. Series favorites such as Stallone, Schwarzenegger and Statham are placed too much to the side in order to make way for a number of new recruits to the mercenary team. Unfortunately, these new members simply don't have the on-screen charisma of their predecessors, thereby making any sort of character interactions quite mundane. There were only two cast members, both whom made their first appearance in this installment, who stood out for me: Antonio Banderas, who plays an overly-enthusiastic, overly-talkative sharpshooter; and Mel Gibson, who makes quite a solid villain, but really doesn't receive the screen time he deserves. The rest of the ensemble, such as Wesley Snipes and Kelsey Grammar, aren't granted enough space to grab the audience's attention or interest. Harrison Ford has a few good lines, but once again, is used too sparingly. In contrast to the first two films, ""The Expendables 3"" seemingly tries too hard to be more of a character-driven installment, sacrificing choreographed fight sequences for often poorly-written conversations, which makes the film quite a dull, plodding experience for the first 90 minutes. The final act, however, picks up the pace dramatically, with great chemistry between the film's headliners and stunning battle scenes.

222,cousbrojs,And You Thought It Gets Better,5,5 August 2014,"I was looking forward to this. I was expecting cheesy dialogue, awesome throwback one liners and references, back and forth banter, funny brotherly chemistry and over the top action. Instead, I got something a whole lot different. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed this movie, probably more than I should, but let's face it, films that start off as 'R' rated can't become ones rated PG-13. You just can't. And it shows in the film. I'm gonna start off with what I didn't like.The film is 2 hours long, so it's longer than the previous films, which meant there was some major pacing issues. There were a couple of times where I would fidget in my chair and check my watch for the time because the film was so focused on it's story that I got bored. That's another thing I didn't like, the story. It's basically a rehash of the previous two films, only difference is that the bad guy is someone from Barney's past that he betrayed. And now they confront each other and both want revenge. It's the same old generic action movie theme.Also the film has weird editing in the middle act, it gets a little mind numbing and confusing by it's constant location changes, but it's all part of the story because Barney needs a new team. Why does he need a new team? Well, that's the biggest issue I had with the film.The characters we've come to love from the previous two films just don't share the same amount of screen him. I was absolutely disappointed at the missed opportunity the director and writers had. If the entire cast were together throughout the film and had great back and forth tension before resolving it in the end, it would have been so much better. But enough of that, it's time for what I liked: The lack of blood spillage and high usage of CGI was made up for with fantastic action set pieces. The train sequence and the final battle were both memorable even if they were long and drawn out, but it was still an enjoyable watch.Mel Gibson did a fantastic job playing the protagonist, even if I think JCVD did a better job in EXP2, Gibson still shone through.The new younger cast were pretty impressive, especially Ronda Rousey, who wasn't just eye candy but a pretty badass femme fetale.But I think everyone can agree, that Antonio Banderas was the best thing about the film. He was funny, charming, really witty but a total badass.All in all, this is the weakest out of the three. I wouldn't watch it again.5/10",The Expendables 3

Anyways, ignore most of the reviews and go enjoy an action packed movie with a decent story (although they claim there is none). Even a good dose of humor though out. I saw it Friday evening and the theater was packed and laughing through a lot of it. The cast is a blend of the original old and some new old characters and a crew of new young Expendables including the first woman. There is even a bit of character development on the new members.

225,benaboo,Not as good as the second but better than the first. The best one in regards to acting and story.,7,30 August 2018,"This movie gets a pretty bad rap but I personally enjoy it. These movies are meant to be fun, not Oscar winners. I don't think this movie is as good as the second film, but it's better than the first. However, this one is the best in regards to story (which isn't saying too much) and acting. With the additions of Wesley Snipes, Harrison Ford, and most especially Mel Gibson the quality of the acting improves. Wesley Snipes is really entertaining but unfortunately after awhile he is pushed to the side. Harrison Ford puts a lot more effort into his performance than Bruce Willis did and it pays off. Mel Gibson easily gives the best performance in the entire movie and I want to see him play more villains. He is a phenomenal actor and people need to forgive him for the mistakes he's made as a human being. We all have flaws. Kelsey Grammer is okay but he feels miscast in this role. He's not an action star. This role would have made more sense if it was played by someone like Nicolas Cage, John Travolta, Dwayne Johnson, Samuel L. Jackson, Denzel Washington, or Tom Cruise. Antonio Banderas is trying to play a version of Leo Getz from the Lethal Weapon films and it does not work. Ronda Rousey needs some acting classes if she is serious about acting. She has potential but she is not very good at all in this movie. Terry Crews and Jet Li are very underused in this movie. I know people complain about how this movie is rated PG-13 instead of R. I do think the movie could have benefited from an R rating but the action is still really good. I love seeing Arnold Schwarzenegger shooting from a helicopter with sunglasses and facial hair. He looks awesome. I also love the ending to this movie because it's awesome to see all these people hanging out in bar and having a good time after saving the day. This movie is not without it's problems but it I find it fun and it's cool seeing all these people in a movie together.",The Expendables 3

227,tariq-hossenbux,The Blood Transfusion Failed,4,15 August 2015,"The first instalments of The Expendables were fun, kind of unrealistic clichés of action films with a good smattering of humorous one liners. If you got your bowl of popcorn and just enjoyed them for the plentiful action sequences and suspended your disbelief they could be enjoyable. This one is way too serious for that though, and bereft of the funny moments that peppered the other films. It tries at points, but the jokes just are not that good. As for the action sequences, the ones in the beginning were promisingly good, but got quite a bit less frequent in the later stages. These later action scenes are also quite a bit less exciting for the most part, and the shallow characters that may have fit in a pure non stop action film probably will not draw much interest from you. In between the tinny gun fights the most interesting thing to do is count the wrinkles and grey hairs on the old crew. Injecting new blood failed to inject life into this one.",The Expendables 3

With a busy lifestyle and so much to do everyday, every now and then you just need to watch an action movie that you do not need to think too much about, that simply washes over you and puts a nostalgic smile on your face.The plot might be thin, you know it will likely come good in the end and you know that the good guy is going to win. But that does not matter a jot. It is filled with quips, familiar faces, memories of the 80's and just good fun.There will be people that hate this film as just another example of mindless violence, but who cares.

230,ace_nair,Old rotten wine in a bottle of questionable vintage!,4,2 September 2014,"The Expendables worked because of the formula : Veteran action stars + old school action + cheesy one-liners = fun for the 30+ age group. Hurrah!The Expendables 2 worked partially because of the curiosity factor left behind by the first installment and the presence of Van Damme on the large screen. Although the finale fight sequence between Van Damme and Stallone is pretty laughable - no way Stallone can beat Van Damme in a fair fight, at any time of his career - the movie was watchable.The Expendables 3 does not work. No sir, it does not. Plain and Simple. The ingenuity of this caper was to bring the millennials in - new faces with the old and my, my... how it falls flat! I'm not getting to the plot because there is none. There is an opening boring action sequence ... yawn, followed by another one ... yawn, and then one hour of movie gyan (my foot fell asleep) followed by the finale action which is quite unbelievable (what the ... unbelievable).The new old faces include Mel Gibson as the villain (he pulls off the role excellently - Hollywood needs to forgive him and get him back in the game), Antonio Banderas as an irritating Expendable wannabe (my 6 year old kid called him the stupid man), Wesley Snipes as an old crony and Harrison Ford as a replacement for Bruce Willis with nothing much to offer in the movie. The new new faces included 4 actors I have absolutely no recollection of. (I should note their names and avoid any movie they are featured in.)Jet Li, Lundgren, Arnie, Crews and the rest had little to no lines in the movie and are as forgettable as Mrs Bachchan Jr's role in The Pink Panther 2. If this movie was a car then this is an absolute lemon. The only reason I am rating this a 4 is because it features Mel Gibson.",The Expendables 3

232,barryweir,A perfectly adequate entry to the series,7,10 September 2014,"I don't get that hate this movie has seemingly generated. It has been portrayed as falling outside the mold of it's predecessors. Much is made of the fact that it reduces the violence of other movies and therefore it's lost it's link to it's 80s inspiration. Well, for those of us who actually grew up in the eighties and remember many of the movies it's based on there were quite a few that were actioners but didn't feature grossly over the top blood and gore. How many remember pool after pool of blood in, say, Lethal Weapon or Commando? Hell, when you consider how absurd the latter is in terms of body count you'd think you'd be watching through a red lense, yet there is very little gore in Commando and it's the perfect template for these Expendables films. Hell, while on the subject of Arnie, take Terminator 2, another example of a film that gets a long just fine in the genre without piles of gore. So I take issue with the complaints leveled at this offering.This movie does what it says on the tin. It gives you Indiana Jones working with The Terminator to kick butt. It gives you Mad Max facing off against Rambo. It gives you guns and explosions and grand set pieces. It gives you one liners and crappy jokes. I see no great departure from the previous movies save for the reduction in gore. It is nostalgic, mindless fluff and provides a more than serviceable two hours of entertainment when you just want something light and fun to relax with after a long day of work.Check it out.",The Expendables 3

There are dozens of main characters, so none of them are motivated well enough that you would even care if they died. And the plot was gibberish, spewed out by the studio to beg a little more money from an aging audience.This movie is clearly aimed at old, white American men with serious revenge fantasies and a desperate lust for their youth. But I have to hope they underestimated the target audience.There are a lot of cameos from action movie heros from the 1980s and 1990s.

One liner dialog that is repeated, thats right- REPEATED through the movie as if to say- ""Idk, give another chopper line Arnold- maybe nobody will notice"".

From all three it's the lesser movie but i've seen a lot of part three's that where way worse and usually it is the third that messes up a trilogy.It is sort of explainable to because usually the surprises are gone and the main goal of the movie is to wrap things up which makes the ending more predictable leaving you with 2 options ...win or loose,live or die,good or bad.Gladly this never had that trilogy feel to it and some more parts will come and basically it could keep on going and going until we end up with a digital Sly, LOL.To me there where enough new elements to root for more of this franchise but for the next one drop the kiddies and give it some more Jet Li fuel.Let him 'F' around with Statham and Lundgrenand you'll have one hell of a movie.So let's go for....four.",The Expendables 3

Mel Gibson played a good bad guy. Wesley, needed more funny lines like in ""Demolition Man"" (the scene in the Museum). People like me (54) will enjoy watching the older actors of this movie. Though, I agree with a reviewer that said ""we enjoy watching the action men of the 80's. Why include young twenty year olds in this movie?"" In the Movie Theater Auditorium: almost all the audience were women. If I were Stallone, I would have casted Linda Hamilton, Sigourney Weaver, or Lucy Liu.

Yes, there are a couple of slow moments but overall it delivers. Character development well done within the action genre; especially liked the transition team idea and it was well done. Stallone, as Barney, pokes fun at his age as well as the other members of his team; nobody is safe from that problem! If you are aware of certain personal issues with certain of the actors, the double meaning in some of their lines is an added bonus (one hint: Ford's character in answering Barney's question). In addition to being a good action movie, the film ""resurrects"" some good old acting skills from Snipes, and especially Gibson and Banderas. Worth seeing for those characters alone.

The action scenes were quite good, with a lot of excellent stunt work and special effects. Mel Gibson did a good job in his role . Unfortunately, the writing and acting was not as good as the first 2 movies. This version did not have much humor and most of the movie stars seemed to be mailing it in, not really getting into their parts. The movie was too long with a run time of over 2 hours. I cannot believe it received a PG-13 rating! The language was fairly clean but there was a lot of violence, way more than warranted a PG-13 rating. Overall, it is not a bad movie, but not a very good one either. This one is not a must see in the theater movie, or at best at matinée prices.",The Expendables 3

That seems to be recipe here as well, but that does not make for a less entertaining ride.Action greats Snipes, Ford, Banderas and Gibson are very welcome additions, with the latter being bad guy 'Conrad Stonebanks', whom the team is sent to capture.The series has been criticised before for having too much testosterone in the mix. This is rife again in this sequel, MMA star Ronda Rousey providing some female relief as newbie 'Luna', but each of the cast add a little something and all gel well together.Action addicts will get a kick out of the numerous fight scenes. Which range from fists and guns to tanks and choppers in a matter of seconds, and explosions-galore, albeit a few very CGI-driven. Many one-liners can be expected as always - all rather cheesy, but providing a good tongue-in-cheek laugh - that will most likely fly over the heads of watchers who haven't seen the casts' earlier films, such as Arnie's ""we need to get to the chupperrrr!"" (said just as it's written), a nod to his Predator days. Antonio Banderas is also providing successful comic relief as talkative and desperate 'Galgo'.All in all, Expendables 3 provides us with an experience that isn't too taxing on the brain, will be enjoyed by those that have grown up with these action heroes, but won't be winning any Academy Awards this time round.",The Expendables 3

244,santiagonunez16,Disappointed in this one,5,7 August 2014,"I was a huge fan of the first two, in fact, I saw them a few times in theatres before buying their DVDs. The big stars, big explosions, over the top action, it's like Stallone was giving something back to the 80s and 90s kids who grew up watching his movies. This time around, it's more of a Lifetime movie of the week, complete with A-Team TV show violence, in a washed down PG-13 kiddie movie. Stallone has just gotten greedy. The explanation on the PG-13 rating is that he wants to expand the movie to a broader audience---in other words more money! While I wouldn't say this movie completely sucks, it just isn't that good. The first one was a complete action feast the fans have been missing from old school action stars, unlike the weak movies that midget Tom Cruise has been putting out. The second one, in my opinion is the best of the series. The inside jokes and cameos or past action stars were all having fun and the energy showed!! This time around the team adds Wesley Snipes, Harrison Ford, and Mel Gibson. Unfortunately none of them are given anything interesting to do. Harrison Ford looks like he's just here to pay some bills and collect a paycheck. Wesley Snipes spends his time trying to live up to Jason Statham as the second box office draw in the movie. Only Mel Gibson is the most interesting new character and the most fun to watch. His villain is compatible to Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight but he's wasted and not enough of him is shown. This sucks too because had he been given more screen time to channel his inner Mad Mel, this movie might have been saved. So what's the movie about? The movie opens with The Expendables breaking Wesley Snipes out of jail on a moving train. Turns out Wesley was one of the original Expendables along with Mel Gibson. There's a joke made about Snipes real life prison past and other than that no real fun. The action scenes are feeble and the overblown stunts are a time killer. Enter the new mission, an arms dealer who turns out to be Mel who Stallone thought he killed way back when. Turns out Mel co-founded The Expendables with Stallone. Mel then wounds Terry Crews but instead of finishing him off, he just shoots him a few times but lets him live. Of course this sets the tone for the rest of the movie. There's some jarring from new CIA liaison Harrison Ford, replacing Bruce Willis as the new CIA contact. A knife fighting show with Snipes and Statham, somewhere in all this Arnold shows up with Jet Li, Kelsey Grammar, Rhonda Rousey, and a bunch of those kids from that sissy vampire movie Twilight get dressed up to play action hero. The action goes beyond hokey, particularly from 50-something Antonio Banderas who's supposed to be some acrobatic super soldier. Some how for 5'9 160 Banderas, the thugs seem to drop at some of silliest fight choreography this side of Ralph Macchio in those dumb Karate Kid movies of the 80s. Anyway, as you can expect there's a final fight between Gibson and Stallone. The movie is hokey, feeble, and missing the fun of the first two. It actually comes across as sort of a kid friendly cartoon. This is one I wouldn't throw good money on and wait for DVD.",The Expendables 3

If you enter the movie the expectation created by the trailer would live up to the first action sequence. After that you could see the quality of this movie drops and boredom throughout the movie till the end. Mel Gibson as ""Conrad Stonebanks"" is a perfect choice for a Villain, but got wasted with the lame script. The script is predictable and does not have any twists or turns. None of the characters were utilized in this movie. All the action heroes are just present there like a reunion. As usual they use the weapons assigned to them with already seen stunt sequences. A 2 hours of complete waste of time. Don't waste your time with this one. I like Jason Statham and I want him out of this franchise for good and choose sensible scripts if he likes to survive little longer as a action hero as the rest of the heroes in this movie is outdated.

249,Cinobite17,Mediocre Film dumbed down for the MTV generation,6,12 November 2014,"I'll keep it short. At over 2 hours long you get the feeling that nothing really happens, there's little action, a lot of... nothing... and then a little more action.As you may have read already, this film was dumbed down to a PG13 rating so the violence is weak. They've introduced a load of new young characters to try and widen the audience and appeal to more kids - which pretty much goes against the whole ethos of the franchise.There are 2 MAJOR bugbears with this film. 1. The ridiculous amount of plot holes and, let's say ""technical errors"". These are supposed to be the best black ops soldiers around, Stallone doesn't know what DARPA is, they spend most of the time in black clothes running past white backgrounds, standing on balconies and walking across glass. When they move, they move in a big black huddle through the absolute middle of the street, hallway, scene. At one point they stumble up a, seemingly endless, river of giant boulders in broad daylight (wearing black) instead of using the flat ground on the banks with the trees for cover. The bigger the gun Stallone has, the closer to his hip he fires it - doesn't aim at all. It's VERY clear that there was no military consultant employed on this film. And then you have an injection of Fast and Furious 6. Jumping speed boats onto moving lorries, one guy drives a motorbike up the tail of a helicopter, jumps off some 150ft in the air grabbing a metal bar with his armpit before shooting people with his free hand. I mean, come on, what is this Die Hard 5?2. The second big issue is the CGI - it's awful. OK, for a college film, it would be pretty good, but this is on par with Syfy Channel films. Everything moves unnaturally, the smoke is very very poor and badly lit, everything looks like it has been super imposed and, at times, the scene appears to have been shot in a studio with a rolling background - reminiscent of the 1950's or budget TV sitcoms.Sorry no, there is a third issue; Shaky cam. I've heard people complain about this in films before but never had an issue with anything (maybe Stealth, that said), but here, Jesus, during the 2 big action scenes (one at the start one at the end) it's ridiculous. It's not that it mashes your brain or gives you a headache, it's just that you have no idea what's going on between the shake and the fast poor editing.The film would be an alright, entertaining piece, but the technical flaws and poor CGI just destroy it. 6/10 for me.",The Expendables 3

The crew going on another mission, but this time something goes terribly wrong. An easy operation suffers surprise and casualty to the group, as a former member named Stonebanks (Gibson as the, presumed to be dead, bad guy) shows up and causes Caesar (Crews) to make one dick joke, shooting a mini-gun and spending the rest of the movie at a hospital. Read: Shoots him.Ross (Stallone) feeling guilty about Caesar fires the entire crew and hires new and young people to take revenge. And everything seem to go according to plan until Stonebanks breaks free, capturing the new crew and sending Ross home, ashamed.But as you know, third time's the charm. Old crew comes back, bickers a bit and sets off to finish what they started so and so many years ago. Also they're joined by a imposing and excited Galgo (Banderas), no guitar cases though, too bad. Missed opportunity, Sly!What follows is a great action filled climax, full to the brim with references from other action films. No more spoilers from here on, go watch it to find out.Personally I've enjoyed the first two films and felt obligated to see the third one. And given the spirit of the previous films it is an entertaining film, no doubt there. But the whole thing about new members and not contributing to the cheesiness, I felt it took away some of the core. You had Chuck Norris make several ""Chuck Norris-jokes"" last time for crying out loud, it's been the cheesiness in these movies that's dragged me to the theaters before. Don't go full out and then retract. Other than that I think that Snipes was an entertaining part of the film, and even got to poke hole of his tax evasion. Also, Randy Couture, is an good fighter. But certainly no decent actor.Closing statement: If you've seen the last two, you might as well see this too. Have a fun time at the theater and bring lots of nachos... because, you know...

253,WinstonNoCGI,Loved it - with a few restrictions,8,27 October 2014,"After watching marvelous Expendables I and boring Expendables II I was very excited to see the latest result of Sylvester Stallone's brilliant heroes legend.To cut a long story short: To me Expendables III, this time again, was an absolutely fabulous flick.I loved seeing the crew splitting up and watching those different threads evolve separately, cumulating in the film's final. That added a touch of complexity to the movie which I liked very much.Giving the antagonist's part to Mel Gibson seems the perfect decision to me. He was vivid and excellent. (Same as all the other main characters, I'd like to add.) Antonio Banderas, who played the absolute reverse of his role in Assassins, was very funny to see. However, I would have loved to see him having some secret skill available, even just for a second.All in all I felt the actors and the story very convincing and well balanced.Yet, there was one central part in the story I absolutely disliked: Does it really need a clash of generations? Why is there a Young vs. Old conflict anyway? Why is it that only young people seem to be able to handle digital devices? And why is ""nerdiness"" and arrogance an essentially juvenile trait in the movie? And why is there an Expendables franchise anyway if the story wants the main characters to tell they're being too old for it? Well, back to the parts I enjoyed: ...* The (thankfully) only babe in the flick this time fitted the cast tremendously. Gee, Ronda Rousey is not one of these sticks usually being cast for cockamamie female fighters... Ronda Rousey had muscles and flesh on her bones. Great! ...* In contrast to Expendables II the actors didn't make fun of themselves being actors. It's so annoying when they do that. Breaking the fourth wall is something I really don't want to see in an action movie. - But I loved these sarcastic relieving humor punchlines in the flick *rofl* ... Great! ...* No CGI blood this time. Excellent! And I loved to see real tanks firing (you could see the dust falling from the stone mounds around) causing real explosions. - However, the helicopter was far too easy to identify as CGI. Bad.* Great camera this time. I loved those detail shots. Very thrilling.* Superb musical score. Great to hear a real orchestra playing this time again.* Excellent lighting.* There were exciting moments when no-one was talking. You could literally feel the tension. Great.* For the German dub: Great to hear Thomas Danneberg excellently dubbing Sylvester Stallone and Arnold Schwarzenegger using different tonal voices. I also relished to hear that all the well known actors were dubbed by their regular voice actors.Well, I can hardly wait to see Expendables IV !!! (Sorry, English is not my native tongue, so please forgive my ineloquence here.)",The Expendables 3
254,kowgirl_tina-1,Story is rather bland,7,15 August 2014,"I actually gave this movie a 7, because I am an action movie junkie, but as much as I enjoyed the explosions and such, I thought the storyline was rather bland.The basic outline is: Barney gets a job assignment. He doesn't want to risk his ""old"" crew, so he hires a younger, inexperienced crew. The inexperience causes them to get caught. The old crew goes to rescue the young crew. That's pretty much it! In the last Expendables, I really felt the camaraderie between Barney, Christmas, Gunner, Toll Road, Caesar, and Yin Yang. Not only do I NOT feel the camaraderie in this movie, there are so many ""hands"" in the pot (actors in the movie), that you see each actor for such a short time, it seems like a waste of talent!Next time Sly, don't spend so much time on getting all the ""name drops"" and concentrate more on the plot line! Oh, I will admit to enjoying Antonio Banderas in the movie. His role was completely opposite of what I expected from him :-)",The Expendables 3

I don't know why people take the time to add a review if it's not gonna get published? Having had time to reflect on my previous comments I still agree that this is indeed a monumental whizz bang take your peanut brain out of your ear and forget about what little you thought you knew about acting and physics production. Awfully uninspired not in just acting but plot which are both so weak it's an insult to the list of stars who somehow got involved in this romper room debacle loosely packaged under the auspice of entertainment.

The other is just boring interplay.As was already written, Banderas and Gibson are stealing their scenes. Arnie is fun to look at. The rest is really boring. All these legendary actors, appearing in this flick, had far better titles in their careers. Better spend your time on watching one of those. Young additions didn't delivered anything. Possibly for the lack of chance to deliver.I hope this is the end of series. Please, make a statement - don't pay a dime for this movie.

257,moorthyvlr,Much Better than Expendables -2,7,27 August 2014,"I gave 7 points only on basis of the Expendables movie series. Last time when I went to watch Expendables 2 it was disappointing. This movie was different...never expected by introducing new faces in the team could change things. By experience I know what to expect from these movies which are not for people who are interested in plot based action although they have done that to some extent. (Silly, Childish when you feel the Villains has always an invisible and invincible shield around him all the time. Also the Heroes are ridiculously careless.) These movies are for people who want their action kings to see their performance though it may not be same as they were before. 2014 not the same 1990s...but when EMPs( as in Godzilla) are fired it is the old way that works. The movie shows lot of fighting but though they are humans does not reveal their defense or tactics even when they are heavily outnumbered...guess that's why it is just entertainment. Even after 3 movies how is that they justify the title well may be that they can't get that actor for the next onemay be they could use it as a new twist in the future. Sometimes I do compare with the RED Series which is not correct as many are based on conspiracy. But it should have to be in par with the A-Team Military veterans who are also geniuses. There is lot work needed to be done if there is next movie but THIS MOVIE COMPARED TO EXPENDABLES-2 IT IS WORTH ITS TIME AND MONEY.",The Expendables 3

I know you need more money in order to get a bigger audience in desperation, unfortunately, you cannot lack too much safety along the way.There's such a serious situation that trying to earn money in desperation also results on not lacking safety along the way. so that means that this movie can still be rated ""R"", even if you need to earn money and get a bigger audience in desperation, but don't lack safety too much along the way at the same time!",The Expendables 3
259,EdWrite,Never mind the quality feel the width,8,1 August 2014,"If you are looking for intellectual enlightenment please stop reading. The Expendables 3 is not for the cerebral it is full of blazing action scenes, comfortable humour and a plot that is held together by duck tape but it delivers in spades. OK Harrison Ford is his usual gray self but Antonio Banderas shines in every scene he is in mixing pathos and humor in a heady mix of, ""why has he not been the lead in anything more than the cat in Shrek"", for so long. Also Wesley Snipes has his moment in the sun as a quipping killer whose knife prowess and capability makes Stratham's character step up to the plate.The character list is a who's who of action heroes and the in jokes keep on rolling. If you love tanks, guns, huge explosions and larger than life characters you'll not be short changed.Personally I think this is the best of the three and I say look past its flaws and just enjoy the ride.",The Expendables 3
260,davidsmith907,Why oh why ruin this franchise???,4,30 June 2015,"The first 2 had it all..THIS HAD IT ALL WRONG.First two films old school action and one liner comedy and then they sit in a room and think ''right how can we fuq it up..oh I know lets add a bunch of young members nobody wants''Utter madness.Just cant believe you can take something so basic and total ruin it. We don't need CGI here or young cast members or serious story.We want old school big name action stars doing lots of action and lots of banter between each other.EASY/SIMPLE.You look at the cast and you think 'how, how can they screw this up? how is it even possible? cant be' But they achieved it. The young cast are a total waste of space and screen time. I didn't enjoy any of they're contribution at all. In fact Ronda Rousey was okay, she is probably the only one that I do think could have been included but the other guys were just pointless, unnecessary to say the least.Mel Gibson stole the show and to be fair to the guy he didn't have a lot to work with, a few cut scenes of him buying a painting and then going in a house and that was it..his entire set up as the big guy was shockingly bad. He did a good job though, when he was give the chance he went with it and delivered so much so I wanted him to win.Whole time watching this film I keep thinking why didn't they give Mel Gibson more bad guy actors..with so many names on the sheet couldn't the young actors have been on his side then we would have had some great 1 v 1 with the older guys... Felt way too heavy on the good side and only Mel carrying the bad guys with loads of cannon fodder..hmm missed opportunity perhaps.Action scenes were poor too...the other films were way better done. Making action films soft so that you can make more money or as Hollywood like to say 'reach a broader audience' ruins a good action piece. I'm not a gore lover but realism is sometimes better.Good things in the films..hmmm Dolph Lundgren as always brilliant and should have been used more. Jason Statham and Slys banter again is good but should have been in more. Snipes was okay, was nice seeing him doing action scenes again.Please please Sly go back to the roots of this film if you decide to make a 4th and make more bad guys..10 good guys vs 1 bad guy sucks...even it up abit will ya",The Expendables 3
261,samukaresma,I don't get the hate?,8,30 July 2021,"This was definitely the best of the trilogy. Sure there were some issues and the new, younger members weren't as good, but it was still a solid action flick with some good laughs. This is meant to be a movie you watch with popcorn and your home theater boosted up to 11. Sit back and just enjoy-it's not even trying to be the next Shawshank Redemption. The actors were great! I loved to see Ford and Gibson on screen again and they do good performances here. The action is fun, well executed and thrilling. The plot is not too special, but overall the movie is a lot of fun and the one-liners work way better in this one.The first one had the problem that it didn't really know whether it was supposed to be a serious or a funny movie. There were some attempts for a serious scene, and there were attempts for a laugh, but both fell a bit short.The second movie was better: it knew it wanted to be a less serious one. There were a couple a-bit-more-serious scenes, but overall the action was entertaining and the plot points were stupidly funny-mostly in a good way.But the third one finally found the balance and turns out it was better when they dialed more to the serious side with some funny bits added. I know these movies are meant to be these throwbacks to the 80's, but in this movie they mixed it a bit and for the good; it didn't feel too cliché and still managed to put some those nostalgia bits.",The Expendables 3

Expendables 1 was okay in my opinion, Expendables 2 was great and then there's this coming in last place. There is simply no character development in this movie. The cg looks like adobe after effects, the camera work is shaky, and there is absolutely no blood and gore. I felt nothing through out the whole movie except boredom and being angry at the fact that I'm wasting my time. Some of my favorite stars like Jet Li had like 3 Min's of screen time and that's it. Mel Gibson was no good as the villain and the last boss fight was so very weak. Jean Claude was the best EX villain. Antonio's character did okay but I think they should used his Mariachi character, instead of being a loud mouth. So much cheesy dialog's here and there; it's really not fun at all. In conclusion this is a passionless excuse of a movie. My rating 2/10 Abysmal.",The Expendables 3
263,anghart,Seems the audience is Expendable,3,7 August 2014,"When the first Expendables was announced, it was supposed to be a throwback to the early years of action cinema - gratuitous violence, one liners and major carnage. The first two films lived up to this. The third is just awful.Instead of spending more time with the aging heroes we've come to love, we get stuck with a bunch of whiny youngsters who don't do anything and aren't very interesting. I seriously doubt the so called ""broader"" audience this film is aimed at are gonna care about it. And the people who were interested in the series are going to be bitterly disappointed. Nice one, Sly!!!Some of the new additions to the cast aren't that bad: Banderas, Snipes, Ford, Grammar, but Gibson completely owns the film - which dies whenever he is not around.How's the action? Instead of being focused and over-the-top like the other two films, we get bland MTV style kills, thanks mainly to the new PG-13 rating. Who thought giving the film this lame rating was a good idea? Hey, lets take a series that is aimed at adults, starring aging action heroes who only the older audience will remember, and turn it into a dumb teen movie where the target audience WILL NOT CARE who they are or what they have done. Surely one of the worst business decisions in recent memory.Newcomer director Patrick Hughes has not done anything with this film, but its really hard to tell if that was intentional or if the PG-13 hack job done to the film has made it bland.Overall, this film is just a waste. Too soft for its hardcore fans, and not ""hip"" enough for its intended young audience. No one will be happy. Sure, it might puts bums on seats for the first week, but it will quickly disappear after that...and with good cause.""What mean Expendable?""

The action is great as is the photography and especially the editing which most moviegoers don't even seem to realise is there. The distinct lack of blood if anything made the movie better because the rapid and kinetic editing is far more pleasurable than watching unrealistic fountains of fake blood and ripped apart limbs to be honest. Basically all 80's Action stars are assembled in this movie which also boasts much better effects than it's predecessors and also a much better written script. So please give this box-office bomb a chance, just because it's not the glorification of violence Rambo V - Last Blood sadly turned out to be it doesn't mean this film doesn't deliver what it is supposed to!",The Expendables 3

I don't remember the characters names i hope they get killed at the start of next film and just so Sly knows - nobody goes to watch the Expendables to watch 4 new people take up the screen time of the action legends they did go to see.Jet Li is billed but is in the film for maybe 30 seconds and doesn't fight.The end fight ended in about 20 seconds with no real climax.Apart from the first action sequence non of the original expendable team get any decent screen time i don't recall Dolph or Randy even getting a fight scene.Its a PG 13 so just imagine Rambo, Predator and Total recall with the blood taken out.There were so many members of the expendable team in the end they could have invaded Iraq; 11 or 12 if you count Arnie.This is not a bad film and worth a watch but not really an expendables film.

Example Jet Li calls Harson Ford an a$shole in apparent response to Harson didn't say anything to provoke it. It just appear to be a random line stuck in somewhere when the edit team got lazy.

There is like 1 hour for different Stallone pictures in the movie, outside action, he's everything, and inside it, 60%.Banderas starring and script is, personally, awesome, so crazy, mad, his way to show us a mad guy is astonishing, epic, and really funny.Obviously, is hard to put a Expendable dying, but this movie is closer to that.After all, they're practically in mortal, in a very exceeded way, but the thing is that the action filming is really great, interesting and exciting, all the fire and guns and bullets flying everywhere, that's great.""How hard can it be to kill ten men?""",The Expendables 3

271,JohnPaulG07,Star Studded Action Packed Thriller,8,24 August 2014,"The Expendables delivers on expectations as an action packed thriller with an all star cast and edge of your seat thrills. Coming into the movie it is easy to expect the loud booms and bangs of your average Arnold Schwarzenegger or Sylvester Stallone action film. The movie however, quickly plunges into an all out manhunt that reminisces of movies such as Silence of the Lambs and The Mask of Zorro. The plot quickly thickens into an emotional tying bind that carries until the closing credits. Mel Gibson does a spectacular job as an arms dealing madman with a score to settle with the ""good guys"" aka The Expendables. However there is more to this film than simply a few good puns and an entertaining yet concise ending. The truth is put simply the action never stops. The few moments of pausing for character and plot development are accompanied with action sequences that give further credibility to the films characters as more than simply super trained action heroes. These comrades of sorts have individual personalities and combat specialties that play into the films climax almost seamlessly. In other words folks there is no shortage of intense scenes of war-like violence that may disturb younger viewers or the faint of heart. However these scenes are not overtly disturbing as to take away the lighthearted nature of the film as a whole and as a superb blockbuster to end the summer season with.",The Expendables 3
272,cybopath,Mission Failed!,1,7 August 2014,"I'm a huge action fan. I loved the first two films so I'm not one of these people who didn't even like the premise in the first place. Expendables 3's biggest insult is it had so much potential. When I heard Mel Gibson, Wes Snipes, Antonio Banderas and Harrison Ford added to the cast I couldn't wait. Why does it fail? Most would attack to PG-13 rating the studio opted for (To reach a wider audience AKA try and make more money) but to be honest that's not this films worst crime. In fact if they had made the film a PG-13 from the ground up, spent money on locations and spectacular set pieces, it might just have worked. No the film is clearly been conceived as an R-Rating, that's why it feels like you're watching a airplane version half the time. What really mucks the film up is it is poorly paced. This is the longest of the trilogy, a shocking 2 hours, and focuses on a bunch of no-name, no talent 'youngsters'. People came to the Expendables for one reason only to see all their favourite action heroes on the screen together not watch some female MMA star frown and mumble 'men' repeatedly in a vain attempt to be Vasquez from Aliens.And just as it felt like it was about to re-deem itself at the final with a showdown between Stallone and Gibson, who plays his role to perfection, it flips fans another finger by giving us a fight so short you might blink and miss it. Seriously if you thought the Stallone-Van Damme fight from the 2nd film was short you ain't seen nothing yet.I'd advise everyone to skip this one in the cinema and pray for a better cut on DVD.",The Expendables 3

Kelsey Grammar's character was a hoot. I was afraid he wouldn't mesh well with all of the big action stars. He did great and held his own. His part was well written. I wish there would have been a little more back story on the new guys. It was good seeing Wesley Snipes back in action. Antonio Bandaras character was a mess but still fun to watch. Harrison Ford was fun to watch in this movie. Ronda Rousey got bad reviews from others but I thought she did fine especially when you consider it was her first big film. Mel Gibson did a great job as the bad guy. My only complaint was the fight scenes in the end were way too fast to see what was really happening. Over all I loved the movie.

A bunch of grumpy old men talking tough when they look like they should just be spending their days in a recliner watching TV. Hey guys when you get this decrepit it's time to hang up the camos. Some young unknown actors who couldn't act their way out of a paper bag and have two looks, mad and really mad.Stallone looks like someone ran over his face with a jeep. Or else the botox went terribly wrong. Harrison Ford is ancient, you can't understand a word he says. More botox problems I guess.Dolph Lungren - wow that was pitiful. His script must have been typed on a sheet of toilet paper. Mostly just a vacant grin.Lines are predictable usually something snarky when someone is shot, ""I bet that musta hurt."" Tons of CGI, to the point where it's no longer believable. Everything in sight is shot up or blown up or destroyed but out heroes don't even break a fingernail.

Everybody gets enough screen time - with the exception of Jet Lee.Mel Gibson and Antonio Banderas steal the show here. Banderas character is very funny and if they do a No4, they should bring him back. Whenever Gibson is around, the movie is giving you a Lethal Weapon vibe. I also thought that Harrison Ford would do a cameo, but he is in more than one scenes.Now as for the young expendables. OK we do not know them, we didn't care so much about them, but all in all it was a nice addition.

Then low and behold it gets a 12A rating and we have another film aimed at kids. These films are meant for adults and this is where it falls flat. Stallone should not have messed with a winning formula. Don't get me wrong I did enjoy the film, but it was so frustrating as it could have been so much better. Arnie is great, so is Snipes, Ford, Stallone and all the other older guys in the film. They are funny and the action is good. Mel Gibson is the star of the show though- he is brilliant as the bad guy; but again with the kiddies rating, this was dumbed down. If they are going to make a number 4, then please write it for adults again, otherwise I fear that you will lose all the people that the original film was intended for.",The Expendables 3
285,hanz12891,I had to force myself to finish,5,17 August 2014,"I was not a big fan of the Expendables 1. Expendables 2 was a bit better, thanks to Simon West's direction. Expendables 3 however, took a big step backwards. It had a lazy script and was painfully clichéd. I know its a throwback to the 80's, but thats no excuse for a movie to be downright lazy and not at least try to innovate. Also, it has a lot more down time. A lot more. Whereas expendables 2 was loaded to the brim with action, expendables 3 takes a lot of time for character development which is not interesting, expect for a handful of times. There were some good moments though. And most of them involved Mel Gibson. I can't remember the last time I saw him as a villain, but he should definitely do it more often. He plays a soldier turned bad. Kind of reminded me of Ed Harris in The Rock. He is a good mix of crazy, and professional. The film's final act was also good, but it was all ruined thanks to one thing. The showdown between Stallone and Gibson. We all knew it was coming but when it did, it was underwhelming as hell. Complete waste of potential.As for the other characters, they are basically divided into two groups; the old and young expendables. Almost NO ONE in the young expendables is likable. The old expendables are OK though. More of the same, with a cool addition of Wesley Snipes. Antonio Banderas however was annoying. Overall, I give this movie a 5/10. I was fresh off watching the Raid 2 and Winter Soldier which are far better action movies. Expendables 3 was just painfully average.",The Expendables 3
286,zafarbg,Should Have Been A Lot of Fun,7,14 September 2014,"After watching the trailers,I Simply thought it to be amazing with the induction of Wesley Snipes And Antonio Banderas.But, I Was Wrong.It Wasn't How i expected it to be.Lesser Violence,Lesser Blood and most of all Lesser Crews.To Be Fair,I was really looking forward to him but i got a 2 Hour Movie without him.Most of all,I was really excited with the cast but the new additions take a lot of screen time than the ones who should have more screen time. The plot was good,but i found it a bit inspired by clichés.Mel Gibson's character was like The Joker From the Dark Knight and also there's a scene including him which was also taken straight from The Dark Knight.I was also looking forward to Jet Li,But He appears for 5 minutes at the final showdown and does nothing but do a couple of already seen moves and uses a machine gun.I was also looking forward to Schwarzenegger and Ford.But Schwarzenegger was only satisfactory and Ford looked like a last-minute substitute(which i think maybe he is).Statham,Stallone,Couture and rest of the old cast got their equal screen time just like the previous movies.Grammar wasn't of much use but was perfectly utilized.But I would have preferred Nicholas Cage (Whom I Think Was The First Choice).Antonio Banderas was great comic relief and seemed a little bit annoying but you wont notice.If You were expecting Snipes doing Blade-sy Action,You're Wrong.But If You were expecting him to doing something you want him to do,You're right.But You can be a little bit disappointed but not much.Finally,The Young Cast.They were supposed to be supporting characters,but were focused heavily more than the old cast.But choosing them was not a mistake and they blended with the movie. Overall,Given All The Stars And Talent,It Should Have been a lot of fun. Still,I Wouldn't end this review as a negative one but i would still recommend it for a Saturday Night with friends and family when it comes out on Home Media.Grade=B+ Score=7.0",The Expendables 3
287,siru-tirronen,And Stallone goes again...,8,17 August 2014,"I'm not sure do this have any spoilers, but I put it on for safety. I have seen ""The Expendables"" and ""The Expendables 2"". I liked the first movie. The sequel was horrible. The third was nice surprise. All of you who will want to see a masterpiece of storytelling etc. - this movie is not for you. And those who want to have just fun- I recommend that you will see this movie. New actors like Wesley Snipe and Antonio Banderas AND Harrison Ford were really good. Mel Gibson in the main villain's role was awesome. I really enjoy when Mel acts. Unfortunately it happens very seldom nowadays. BUT! The plot is simple: the movie's theme was (surprise surprise) revenge to ex-expendable. To do that Barney(Sylvester Stallone) has to change his old crew to new and younger group. But we all know that it'll need more than that... the joking theme in this movie is aging and being replaced- they get few brilliant jokes from it. I liked this more than ""The Expendables 2"" because this has much better plot and well timed comic. Thanks to Harrison Ford, Wesley Snipe and Antonio Banderas who will share the comments. I found him hilarious. Someone could find him a pain in the ass. I don't like the younger group but I understand why they are in this movie. Harrison Ford surprised me in this because at the beginning he seemed to be a little stressed but he found his style later. I think this movie didn't need Jet Li but more Arnold. It's little sad why Arnold has so little screen time but I suppose it's what Stallone wants. He is the boss and if someone hasn't noticed he has the most screen time. SO- if you liked the two movies before this, go see this one. THIS is good sequel and if you want to see the best together, you know what to do.",The Expendables 3
288,jruffs,Does not deserve such a high rating.,4,24 July 2019,"As a fan of the first two films:
What a let down.
For some reason, unexplained, they ridiculously made a PG13 Expendables, then got rid of the main cast and replaced them with the talentless likes of Rhonda Rousey and some other unknowns.
People watch The Expendables for the amazing line up of action stars, big name badass's from our youth like Stallone, Schwarzenegger, Lundgren, and then there's Statham (England 🤘).
Jet Li was in the film for 3 minutes and doesn't even kick anyone!
I'm not really sure what they were thinking when they wrote the script other than (let's destroy this franchise)
Expendables was great.
Expendables 2 was better.
Expendables 3 was B-movie level writing and directing, oh yeah I forgot about the directing, all fight choreography became void when the director decided to shake the camera about and edit so only small snippets of action made it into the film, embarrassing, amateurish work.

What will they get? nothing but disappointment.I movie is, and supposed to be, a mindless explosive fun action blockbuster. It delivers all that you want from such a film, close combats, gun fights, explosions, etc.The humour is funny as was the case with the other two versions. The story is more interesting than the other two, and introduces some new characters (though somewhat shallow).Performances are fine for an action movie. I specially admire Statham's acting. Maybe the only one a little bit behind in this respect is Randy Couture, who is after all a UFC fighter.A drawback of this movie may be its CGI effects. They could do a better job on that.All in all, The Expendables 3 is a great action movie that will satisfy those who watch it for what it is.My score: 6/10",The Expendables 3

Now for the next part, a whole new cast is needed and a new perspective.First, throw away the newbies.At the begining of the movie Stallone must die in battle with an alien/demonic force.To combat this force a new team must be asembled.Christopher Lambert, master swordsman and demon hunter, Clancy Brown(The Kurgan, Horde Warchief-he is the one who kills Stallone, let's face it Stallone is no match for the Kurgan, Clancy is also an agent of a secret society working for an alien power, Justin Whalin- Christopher Lambert's apprentice, Jackie Chan-master racecar driver, Val Kilmer, master thief, Michael Dudikoff-ninjutsu master, Pierce Brosnan-retired secret agent investiganting the organisation, Mel Gibson and Dolph Lundgreen should also be in the cast.As sidekicks we should also have Bill Paxton-expert in unusual weather phonomenons and Matthew Broderick expert in mutated creatures! A womandshould also be helping the team, and get kidnapped at some pointI Scarlett Johansson would fit this role perfectly!
The leader of the new team should be none other that Snake Plissken! And it will be revealed that Stallone is not really dead, but turned into a cyborg, so the two titans can eventually clash at the end! Rambo vs Snake Plissken! The fight we all want to see for ages!

293,itclark64,Another Action Star Dream Team,6,29 August 2014,"Like the other two Expendables movies Expendables 3 isn't about story, concept, stylistic visuals, or character. It's about is action, action stars, and being manly. The characters aren't characters at all they are the persona's of every famous action star (and apparently sports star) that they can cram into one movie. The latest iteration has the most stars yet but it feels crowded and rushed because of that. The action scenes are good but if that's all your interested in there are better movies out there.The Expendables movie series is like like the superhero team up of the Avengers but its with action stars. It's less about characters and more about the persona based on each actors previous collective roles. This time most of the old favorites return (five major stars from the previous two films don't make an appearance) and there are several new stars joining the franchise. The fun in these movies is seeing all these great stars on screen together at the same time. Some of them are good actors and all of them have an incredible screen presence. The movie feels a little bloated with all the different stars and many actors don't get nearly enough screen time. With so many big stars and their characters so underdeveloped, I can't remember what the name of any of their characters are. I just think of them as their name in real life. Since the stars are the whole draw of the movie, it's no wonder they didn't bother spending time on character or plot development.Seeing all these stars on screen at the same time, I think its clear that of all the muscle bound action stars of the 80's, Stallone is probably the best actor. That is to say he's a better actor than Arnold Schwarzenegger. He is one of the only characters that had something even resembling a character arc. The themes of his story revolve around a sense of family, getting older, and protecting the ones closest to you. Sylvester Stallone breaks up his team because he is afraid of causing his friends deaths and recruits four new people to accomplish his mission. Two of the newbies Kellen Lutz and Glen Powell seem to be unknowns for the most part and certainly not worthy of sharing scenes with some of the genre's greats. They show up and get so little screen time they end up being completely forgettable. Even though I'm sure some people will get a kick out of seeing Victor Ortiz in an action movie there wasn't really anything memorable about his part in the film. Ronda Rousey has made a name for herself in the MMA world for being beautiful and tough. Of all the young newcomers her scenes were the most enjoyable to watch. She does well for not being a professional actress and her fights are definitely not forgettable. I wouldn't mind seeing her in more action films.Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture, and Terry Crews are in the movie...and that's really all there is to say about them. If you saw them in the other two movies you see them again in this one.Wesley Snipes appears early in the film and is introduced in an elaborate inside joke. If you know what Wesley Snipes has been up to for the past decade or so then you will find this pretty amusing. He quickly develops a rivalry with Jason Statham and its fun to watch these two compete against each other while they are supposed to be working together. Mel Gibson is also in the movie trying to make a career comeback. He hasn't been in many movies recently since he's a blatant racist and Hollywood frowns on such behavior. Even before all the media fallout I always said Mel Gibson plays crazy better than anyone else. Now I'm starting to think he might not have been acting. In this movie he plays(?) crazy again as the villain. He's a good bad guy but since he was never really known for his fight scenes, the final showdown felt a bit underwhelming.Kelsey Grammar is best known as Frasier Crane and I can't think of a single action movie he has ever been in. Every time Antonio Banderas was on screen I was laughing or at least chuckling a bit. His charisma just pops off the screen and works well as comic relief for the last third of the film. A few years ago I thought I would never see Harrison Ford in movies again. He's getting old and I don't think he needs the money. After it was announced he would be in the new Star Wars, I asked myself 'Does he still got it?' After I saw this move I got my answer. He has such a screen presence for the few scenes he's in. He could have easily phoned it in but he shows up and it's just like Han Solo showed up for a couple of scenes. That's what this movie is all about though. Big stars are all sharing screen time together. You may not get to see them for long and the action scenes might be a bit run of the mill but they are all there and that alone is pretty cool.",The Expendables 3

Does Sly think the audience he aimed the originals at has somehow gone back in time and are now teenagers, wondering who he is?Why would you get all these stars together and make this tripe?The special effects are seriously bad, the morals of it even worse - bad guy commits genocide > good guys commit genocide to get bad guy!I mean seriously, by the time they get the bad guy they've butchered about 400 people, but barely a drop of blood is seen.The acting is horrific, Jason Statham really shouldn't be doing this and Antonio Banderas should be ashamed for taking part in this.It's like they all just wanted a lads holiday and decided to make a movie while drunk at the bar and wrote the script on a bunch of napkins covered in Bourbon.Rumour has it they intend on making a film with an all female cast. I seriously hope they don't, if the lead female in this is anything to go by.What a waste of money, actors and my time, which is not expendable on watching rubbish films and Sly attempting to run like a midget grandad on steroids.2/10",The Expendables 3

The two positive parts are also quick explained, Gibson and Wesley Snipes stick out of the throughout very predictable and lame script and even lamer directing. Somehow everybody of the cast has to get his/her screen time I suppose....If the movie would have been better with different visuals and more realistic (in reference to the supposed people that are portrait) vocabulary is hypothetical, but the PG 13 stamp made it probably worse than it could have been. Who expects an ""80's"" action movie will be disappointed due to the lack of ""ketch up"" and who expects a 2014 Action movie will be disappointed due to the lack of popular stars for the crowd. Although some younger ""expendables"" were casted (probably for the younger crowd), they made the movie in the end really ""boooom""....(Who wants to have a hint of the probably best scene of the movie, please refer to the buying Art scene with Mel Gibson.

No suspense whatsoever; it's even worse than a Micheal Bay film. -The climax fight was just 3 minutes tops and was like Stallone wasn't even trying. -PG-13 violence; Christmas's knife stabs are now blood-less and bullets are now made of rubber since nobody bleeds or spurts blood after being fired upon by a minigun. Seriously? -The storyline is just a drag and dull; the worst in the series IMO. The ""young-bloods"" in this movie are just plain unlikeable, arrogant and disrespectful i.e. One of the young ones (I didn't even bother knowing his character name) screamed at Stallone to shut up. Are these kind of characters the ones we're supposed to like?-Banderas was just wasted and everyone hates his character. He was supposed to be comic-relief, but instead he's just annoying. -Talking about comic-relief, the jokes were just bad. I remembered laughing with tears watching EX2; I barely grinned at this.

298,ThankfulForJesus,liked the first two? you will enjoy this one,10,17 August 2014,"My 10/10 rating is a bit bloated ill admit, but this movie doesn't deserve the immense criticism its getting. Sure its cheesy at times, but a solid plot(as far as Expendables goes), phenomenal cast, and exciting action- the last half hour is extraordinary, just a really fun time. In addition to the classic bunch from the first two, Banderas and Grammar are hilarious and Gibson is great as Stonebanks. A rating of 8/10 would probably be more accurate but it is far more entertaining than its current 6.3 leads one to believe.Much like the first two, if you go in expecting an Acadamy Award winning film you will leave unhappy.

299,christianfheins,Not worth watching,2,22 June 2015,"Honestly one of the worst movies I've seen so far, and so one of the lowest scores i've given to a movie.The quality of the movie is just awful on every aspect; Visual effects, the scrip, the story, the acting and even the length. For a movie this awful, more than two hours is a huge challenge.... to the viewers! Is so hard to watch!. Just to give you an example; the helicopters on the movie (all of them) are computer made, and they look so fake, the major explosion, effects and so on are also computer made and they don't bring anything to the movie. Bollywood effects are better. Expendables 3 compares perhaps with Nigerian low budget visual effect movies.Indeed I felt exited on the first movie of the Expendables, just for the fact of having all the actors I grew up watching on TV, now on a single movie. However memory played a trick on me, and maybe for the 80's, the quality of acting of them was good, but not for today's standards, most of them have no proper training on acting and all of them deliver a quite bad overall experience. Antonio Banderas tried to make something cool, but again, the scrip, story and effect made no contribution to his acting.I really hope they don't come up with a 4th version of this awful set of movies.Let's be honest, they were stars in the 80's, but let the 80's be their time. This movies are just a joke, if I want to go back to the 80's I watch Commando or Rocky or something like that, and believe me, those movies are way better than the Expendables trilogy, at least they are classic movies.Sorry for the heroes of my childhood, but their time has passed.",The Expendables 3

301,Gerryt22,We have found our first expendable Expendables film,1,15 August 2014,"Here is another example of what people call the ""Godfather trilogy effect"". First film - good, second film - amazing, and third film - awful! Though I will say I did like Godfather Part 3 but I figure I'd use this example. I could have also used Sam Raimi's Spider-Man trilogy or even X-Men. But it seems like now we have found our newest culprit. The film tries to continue the same trend that the previous installments have accomplished: little plot, cheesy humor, and BIG action. When you seem to forget the two latter parts you know you have a problem. Not only did this film lack memorable action scenes but it also lacked humor. What made the second film so great was that it didn't take itself too serious and had fun and contained cheesy (and maybe even cringing) humor. But that's how those classic 80s and 90s action films worked. Had this been the first film in the series I'd be more forgiving but this is not the case. This is the third installment to an action franchise that pays tribute to classic action films. Boy some tribute this film was! There are SOME redeeming qualities. The additions of Wesley Snipes, Harrison Ford, Antonio Banderas, and Mel Gibson are certainly welcomed additions to the ensemble. There was more screen time for the Terminator himself, Arnold Schwarzenegger. And (POSSIBLE SPOILER) he even says one of his most iconic movie lines, no, not ""I'll be back"", the other classic line dealing with some sort of aircraft ;)Along with the newer veteran action stars we've also gotten newer younger faces that include boxer Victor Ortiz, MMA fighter Ronda Rousey, and actors Glen Powell and Kellen Lutz. Out of the four, Lutz was the most interesting one. Once we meet his character the script seems to set up something big for the young expendable. By the time the climax comes around it was like they just forgot what they've written. Lutz also gave the better performance out of the four younglings. Now obviously this isn't a film series that's known for it's acting, however, Rousey's acting was god awful! Physically she was great, however, but again worst performance in the film. She's like a female Hayden Christiensen. But don't get me wrong she is pretty. Another suckish thing this film has done, which the previous film is guilty of as well: Barley any Jet Li! However this film did it much worse by not even giving him martial arts scenes, which the previous film did have. How in the bloody hell do you have one of the most iconic martial artist in your film yet don't even give him any martial arts scenes?!?!? Oh and by the way, note that none of my complaints for this film deal with the whole fact that this film was PG-13 rather than an R. I never cared one bit if the film is R or PG-13. All I ask for is a good entertaining film. I'd still watch the film had it been Pixar animated and rated PG! If the rating is your only complaint towards this film then I suggest you delete your IMDb account and go watch Teen Mom. A film's rating doesn't give it quality.It's such a shame knowing that this new installment to the Expendables series might just be the last to feature most of the veteran action stars such as Stallone and Statham. In no way what so ever did this feel like 'the last ride' the trailers seemed to promise us. Now clearly there will most likely be more Expendables films moving forward but it seems as though we have found our first expendable installment.1/10 -Gerry T",The Expendables 3
302,mariuskleppe,"Would be great if there was blood, but it's still good without.",7,12 August 2014,"To get the bad things out of the way first: The movie has almost no blood, Jet Li and Terry Crews gets way to little screen-time, and the mid-section of the movie could've moved along faster. Now, for the good parts: Mel Gibson is awesome as the villain. He delivers a truly great performance. Antonio Banderas was a good cast for a very funny character, you can see that he had a blast doing this. The same goes for Wesley Snipes, who plays a somewhat disturbed character who competes with Statham in knifing skills. It's also fun to see Harrison Ford with these guys, he's clearly having a blast as well. The action in the last 30 minutes of the movie is very good, and you almost forget about the lack of blood. To sum it up: great fun and a rock-solid villain, but it's impossible to have such a high bodycount without any blood! I just hope that they will release an unrated version on blu-ray. If they do, it will be better than the first one, and almost as good as the second one. A version of this with blood would get an extra point from me. (If not two!)

303,nbalive_fanatic,The magic is gone,5,6 August 2014,"When I heard about the first Expendables movie when it was in production, I was excited because I knew it would be the antithesis of the modern summer action blockbuster. The biggest action stars of yesteryear coupled with a few tough guys from the past decade and some B-movie veterans? I was sold. While the final product wasn't great, it delivered its variety of brain dead action, cheesy one-liners and throwback ultra-violence in heaps. The second cranked up the corniness, but everything else managed to hit it's stride. The directing was a little better, the action choreography was better and JCVD delivered big time as the main baddie.This time around, all I can say is it's disappointing. The first two movies never truly lived up to their full potential, but they were still fine for what they were. This movie is just not very good and you can't really blame that on the PG-13 rating. It's almost a complete stylistic departure from the last outings. For one thing, it's a lot more Stallone-centric. EX1 and 2 had he and Statham as the focus, but it still felt like an ensemble. Even though there's two teams of Expendables here, it never really feels like more than 'Stallone and the other guys'. Secondly, it takes itself a bit too seriously. The fourth wall straddling self-awareness is all but gone. Yes, Snipes makes a joke about tax evasion and Ah-nuld suggests proceeding to the nearest helicopter not once, but twice...but this is still a pretty drab affair. What was great about the others was the fact the guys looked like they were having a good time. They knew some of the things they were saying and doing were ridiculous, but that was the point! Gibson doesn't even have a right hand man like Austin or Adkins, for goodness sakes.The PG-13 rating is the kicker, though. It drains what little blood (pun intended) this movie has left. Don't get me wrong, there are a couple of nice action set pieces where the crew gets to show off their talents. The final showdown is quite earnest and there are some nifty nuggets of hand to hand combat. I will also say Mel is quite good as the villain. Besides that, the rating's limitations really take center stage. Quick cutaways before bullet and knife impacts, not an ounce of blood showing up when some gets shot and a ton of off camera kills. I have no idea what the box office will be like, so I can't say the decision to broaden the audience for more mainstream appeal was bad. What I will say is that it's obvious. The franchise sold its soul, plain and simple. It's sanitized and has too many flaws that might have been covered up had it remained a kitschy tribute to R rated action flicks. The Expendables have truly become expendable.",The Expendables 3

Characters like Rhonda Rousey who simply can't act doesn't help much, have never really understood the appeal of Jason Stratham he seems to be the same character in every movie he has ever been in.

A fantastic performance by Antonio Banderas, really well done and of course the return of Wesley Snipes, great to see him back in action in a job he definitely pulled off. Mel Gibson as the bad guy worked well for me but his role could've been more crafted as far as I'm concerned. The humor was on target considering the many laughs from the audience, I certainly enjoyed it. The action was also very well executed and held a good pace. The positive (changes) compared to the former two movies was the absence of the blood and guts (adds nothing for me), this cast (additions), much better paced action and logic and everything seemed to work.

Is it because his ego won't permit him to work with a director of the calibre needed- John Woo or John MacTiernan, say? Instead we have the usual.....a bunch of overpaid, over the hill action stars smirking their way through several anaemic action set pieces- made even more pointless by being edited down for a family rating. The dialogue is as woeful as ever, and the newcomers are a disappointment- Snipes looks bored, whilst Mel Gibson and Antonio Banderas wildly overact to the point of embarrassment. Overall, this is pathetic. And worse, it's an insult to those who love 80s action movies.",The Expendables 3
307,thepopcornside,Did not like the new kids,5,12 August 2014,"The one thing I like about the Expendables is that I get to watch the heroes I used to watch growing up, it doesn't have to be a contender for an Oscar, I just want a nice walk down memory lane,with my favorite heroes from days past. So a few things made the movie less entertaining and more painful to watch for me. The biggest pain was the new kids. There's this girl who is supposed to be this super girl who fights in mini skirts and high heals (lie) and her favorite word is men, then there is this other guy who I think was supposed to attract the females because of his face (didn't work for me) and he only knows how to drive motorbikes stunt master style, then there's the computer geek who does not know how to talk to his elders in a respectable way, (actually all those kids had very bad manners when it came to respecting their elders), then there was a fourth one but thank heavens because he went practically unnoticed on my part. Then there is the waste of talent, Jet Li did nothing but hold a gun and follow Commando everywhere, no kicks or any of that cool stuff we know him for. I thought Antonio Banderas would give us the Desperado side of him but no... it was the puss in boots side of him, the annoying version. But he is a great actor and he made it less painful, still wish they would have gone the Desperado way. Jason Statham didn't have his killer lines, and so on. But the real actors no matter how bad their roles were written in this did their best. But the new kids, wish they would have just exploded in the chopper at the beginning. It's watchable if you can overlook the dumb parts. I wanted to give this one less stars but there's too many people I like in this movie to do that to them.",The Expendables 3
308,beronginigo,a waste of film,1,25 April 2016,"Boy, this movie sucked. The first in the franchise was a mediocre direct to DVD style film (which is an insult to direct to DVD movies, a few of these are actually better than some garbage churned out by Hollywood), the sequel was over the top, dumb fun and easily the best in the series (I enjoy action movies where there is actual spilling of blood; I don't understand these movies where someone gets shot and the dude doesn't even bleed, kind of stupid actually; which is why films like Saving Private Ryan ranks high in my book).The third installment though is one of the most boring travesties put to film. The action is uninspired and plods along. The new members of the expendables team are wasted. Honestly, what was Banderas supposed to be doing in this movie anyway? Talk and do nothing? He was more interesting and entertaining in that Sponge Bob movie than this. The same goes for Snipes; no memorable character or action scenes here like in Demolition Man or Blade.This is what happens when greed and corporate people enter the equation. A movie with no soul for people who have nothing to do in the cinema. Ideal for necking and petting couples.",The Expendables 3
309,becaangel,My opinion,5,21 December 2020,"The movie is meh...but my biggest problem with the script is why did Barney (Stallone) leave his original crew for so long during the movie only to hire a bunch of uninteresting cry babies with no personalities.Billy the kid, the new recruit on Expendables 2 was a way better character,likable and with a good backstory.I was super sad when they killed him, they should've leave him for the rest of the franchise...He has chemistry with the old mercenaries.

310,borchart,Did not like it,3,5 September 2014,"I have watched all the three expendables movies and this is for sure the worst one. I cannot really suggest to go to the cinema for it. The reason i did not like it is the plot. I would have hoped for a big adventure where the whole expendables team needs to work together and does that with lot of jokes. Every member of the team should have a strength that is necessary to achieve the goal. Unfortunately the plot is very different and the team is split up very early in the movie. Trust is lost between the team members and the happy we-are-one-team atmosphere is gone. The movie drags on with new and rather lame characters and the actual mission for the team is not very interesting and rather artificial even for that type of movie. The action heroes move like senior citizens armed to their teeth and attack their enemies always during daytime and all together via the front door. It is all so unprofessional. Next time please put in Chuck Norris again, he rulez!",The Expendables 3

They all get their time on screen, and make damned good use of it. Some of them you haven't seen in an action picture in quite some time and a couple, you haven't seen in one at all. They don't miss a beat. Mel Gibson, in particular, steals this film. Action out the kazoo, from opening scene till last. Looking at these guys, we could send them overseas today and they would do some serious damage. I didn't watch 1 and 2 until right before I saw this, just to get a little reference material.

313,jdowlicious,Who is this movie even for?,4,4 August 2014,"The Expendables series was supposed to be bring back the thrills of the great 80s action films. Nostalgia is the safe go-to for audiences of today, and Stallone knows this. Most of the man's career has revolved around him playing the same roles for over 30 years. The trailer came out and it was extremely promising. Bringing in actors like Schwarzenegger, Dolph Lundgren, Bruce Willis and what do you know? Stallone was even directing, a man who had proved himself a competent action director. Even of recent years, Rambo IV was pretty awesome. Ironically however, these 80s stars created something as dull and humourless as today's modern action films. Where was the fun? Where was the one liners? What should have been a spectacle piece with soul was a shaky-cam filled ride of nauseating proportions. Sure there were some small moments of fun, but they were few and far between. So, has the third iteration in the series any good? Not really.The movie follows The Expendables on a mission to stop a weapon's trade, they discover an old foe once thought dead (Gibson), takes out one of their own. Their leader, Barney (Stallone), to keep the rest of his Expendables brethren safe, goes on a suicide mission with a new younger team to exact revenge.Here lies the fundamental problem with the film - the actual Expendables aren't the focus of the movie. There's been an attempt by the filmmakers to attract a younger audience by bringing in fresh, younger 'action stars' and of course the PG-13 rating, the series' first. This could have worked, if they hired ANYBODY who had a star credit in the past three years. Instead, the audience is subjected to a bunch of no-name stars running around, spouting annoying banter at one another. The reason why people come to see these movies are for the nostalgia of the past films these actors have been in, and that they are in a film altogether. So when you disband what the audiences came for and replace them with a bunch of nobodies, you're completely alienating your existing fan base. What people want to see if Rocky and The Terminator killing bad guys together, and when you just replace them with regular mercenaries, it isn't special to the viewers anymore.That's not to say that's the only problem with the film. For this type of movie, motives of character's aren't entirely clear. Why would Barney abandon his loyal team ready to fight by his side for a bunch of random mercenaries? The action is still largely incoherent, with either way too many cuts during the scene or really poorly executed fight choreography. The visual effects department looks like it had to take a pay cut for the actor's, there is better CGI on Agent's of Shield (every car ride is flat green-screen, one scene with a base jumper just looks completely unfinished). The editing - dear lord - the editing in this movie is some of the worse I have seen in a film in a long time. There are multiple cutaways to things for a minuscule amount of time that the audience has no idea what it is (a scene ends with a guy who the audience hasn't picking up a magazine and leaving), or is completely unintentionally hilarious with how the cut has been executed. The main example that sticks out is a scene that slowly zooms in dramatically on Stallone's face for about thirty seconds, as if the character was about to have a flashback, just to cut straight to the next scene at a hospital. However, the biggest crime this film commits is it's waste of talent. Jet Li is one of the top billed actors, and yet has about 90 seconds of screen time. Wesley Snipes has a fun and humorous introduction to his character, but then is just relegated to the background after the first act. Terry Crews is one of the most charismatic actors in films today and he is COMPLETELY wasted in the movie.This movie is getting a 4/10 from me, because there are several elements that save this lazily made film. Antonio Banderas is an absolute joy to watch, giving a crazy, over the top performance that would make Nicolas Cage jealous. Mel Gibson, whilst more restrained, gives his all as the crazy bad guy, and although the majority of the visual effects are an eyesore, the stunt work in the third act of the film is quite impressive and even engaging.Skip this one, go watch Guardians at the cinemas again.",The Expendables 3

Some of the corniest 2 hours you'll ever live watching an amalgamation of Has-Been and Would-Be Hollywood action stars mowing a human lawn. It is only topped in it's ridiculousness by the infamously cheesy Expendables 2. Is it that Stalone and his 80s/90s Action Star colleagues have ensnared our generation in a dark love spell so we will love whatever they defaecate on the screen or is it just US. The expendables 3 insults both the viewer's intellect and imagination. Furthermore the plot is as shallow as the ink on the paper Stalone used to write the script and the only real special effects done in the movie are restricted to the use of explosives. IT'S A COMPLETE WASTE OF THE ACTORS AND VIEWERS LIFESPAN AND I LOVED EVERY SECOND OF IT'S RUNNING TIME.",The Expendables 3
315,andrewgoro,Boredom,3,17 November 2014,"First of all I am old school fan of all those actors , and no matter how I wanted to like this one, it did not work. 1. Very poor story. I mean how can it be more simpler and more obvious than this one? 2. Very poor directing. I don't think Patrick Hughes has any idea how to shoot old school movies. I am not director, but you can't find pleasure by watching this movie. 3. PG-13. It seems like the movie was shot as R. If you look at how people are get shot, it is very similar to previous Expendables and Rambo 4. But the fact that there is no blood makes the action scenes look terrible, very boring and stupid. 4. Cast. Were Statham, Lundgren, Li, Schwarzenegger in this movie at all? I can remember Snipes was noticeable in the beginning and Ford flying helicopter. I don't really care about Crews or Couture. And what did Schwarzenegger do there for more than a week? And his acting gets worse with every movie. He was just terrible barely moving compared to the rest of cast. 5. Poor CGI. I can't even comment on that. It is really a shame that in 2014 we have such poor CGI. Feels like it was made by 5 year old. 6. Fight in the end. All this fighting with armies and tanks was way too much. Those actors are famous for fighting armies on their own, but this was just too unreal that armies just showed up all the time exactly near Expendables so they can be killed. 7. Weak villain. It's not Mel's fault, he did his best I believe. But his character is so much boring and weaker than Ex1 or Ex2.The only positive I remember from 2 hours and 11 minutes is Banderas character which made this movie a bit alive, and one joke from young expendables who make fun of 1985. That's pretty much it.Conclusion: Waste of cast and complete boredom. Ex1 and Ex2 are masterpiece compared to this one.",The Expendables 3

I guess that's why I haven't seen an over the top advertising campaign. They didn't even want to spend the money. So why should you? I liked the idea of getting a crew of a bunch of action stars together in a single franchise. The possibilities are endless, so why did they go to the bad end?? I dunno?! Didn't anybody watch the dailies? Or the final cut and make the hard call for some adjustments? In the end themovie is dull, feeling like every scene is stretched to long, without any connection to the characters, plot, or even any action scene. I really wanted to like this film, but they wouldn't let me. They lost so much money on making a horrible movie nobody wants to see, that they now are trying to get money from broke pirates that don't even have money to buy a ticket in the first place.

319,novaman100,Worth seeing. Think low ratings on this site are exaggerated,8,17 August 2014,"First off, Expendables 2 was better and I do not think anyone will argue that. But some of the poor reviews on here almost made me second guess going, and the reviews likely had an effect, since only a handful were in the theater last night (9:45 showing) My take on the young actors/new team is yes, the older one's are better but they tied in nicely in being immature where when the old team returns to clean up the youthful's inexperience issues. Bandera's was Hilarious, the few in the theater were laughing a lot at him. He was annoying, but that is what made it comical. The one disappointment, wish Chuck Norris would have made a brief appearance like in part2. Agree, the younger actors were used to attract a younger audience, but did not see that in the audience when I was there. I'm 39 and would say audience was 30 and up. Also thought perhaps the newer actors were used to pull lower the $$ down some, might be BS, but just my thought. Not the movie going type either, haven't been to theater in 3+ yrs, much rather watch at home(DVD or Blue ray) to take b-room breaks and refill my mug ;-). This movie was worth going to.

322,Dexter22,Change isn't always a good thing,8,3 September 2014,"The plot of this film isn't really why you should watch it. The set up is well done and gets you excited for the possibility of finally getting the formula right. The film has several positives going for it. Wesley Snipes is the star of the first 20 minutes, this being his reintroduction the the action genre after a long time away. The basic story of this film turn out to be a revenge mission against Stonebanks, played with the perfect amount of wink and intensity by Mel Gibson. Stonebanks is a former Expendable gone rouge, and after he takes something from the team, Barney decides that a new, younger team is needed to take him down.This is where the problems come in. Without spoiling it, the audience never feels that something really has been taken from The Expendables, an obvious missed opportunity for emotion that you will see when viewing the film. The next aspect being that Stallone retires his old team in fear of their safety. This could work but it isn't done in a way that is believable, making it odd that he suddenly cares if his team gets hurt. These films have never been for the masses, but rather fans of the classic action stars and films and this film makes a small mistake by putting the classics by the waste side for a good deal of the film in replacing of younger action ""stars"".This could actually be a really great plot device if the new team wasn't such a mixed bag. If you're going to replace the team then younger actors better have a great screen presence, and while some have their good scenes, they just cant hold their own. This is perhaps a lack of finding people that are other than ""faces"" but also lay in the script. You get the feeling that this film started as a great idea that became more of a template because of too many ideas from too many people.Having said all of this the complaints don't last too long as Mel Gibson shines in scenes that sometimes feel as though they are from another film. I was one who actually like how Schwarzenegger was portrayed in this film. He feels gritty, somewhat tired, and harder edged. The director Patrick Hughes seems interested in making Trench more mysterious, something that could be very interesting if played out. Statham doesn't get to do much, as sadly most of the team doesn't. This is unfortunate because Lundgren steals scenes by just standing there. Gunnar Jensen has been a character that could be so much more, and this shows in scenes where he gets to just use his face to express darkness. Couture is improving and sadly doesn't get to showcase his fighting skills as he should. Snipes is clearly having a blast and steals his scenes. Ford is good as the suit, however when getting in on the action you sometimes cringe at his lines, but this is all forgiven when you can see how much fun everyone is having, especially Banderas. If you love or hate the character he plays, its your choice, but there is no doubt that he brings out some form of expression from the audience, creating one of the more colorful characters of the franchise. Lastly Stallone, who seems incredibly different in this outing. On one hand he actually seems his age and more fatherly, conversely he is much less likable and this is what hurts the film as he takes up mostly every scene.The film is a mixed bag that is saved by great action. Action that could have been even better if it wasn't so edited to receive a PG-13 rating. Hopefully a proper version is released because it could improve many scenes. If this franchise continues, one can only hope that Stallone sees that less is more. Focus on the interesting characters, not just stuffing the screen with them, and actually live up to the name EXPENDABLES.",The Expendables 3
323,joesmaname,If you liked the first you'll love the third,8,6 August 2015,"I thought the first Expendables was decent, passed on the second - mostly because they wrote Lundgren's character back in as if Expendables 1 never happened and that just seemed too dumb. I checked out 3 because it was playing second at the drive-in.Glad I did, it was so much better than the first (can't speak for #2) The entire cast worked flawlessly together, young and old. The story flows smoothly through an enjoyable, if somewhat predictable arc and for an action movie is particularly well written. There are some rather enjoyable surprises as to who shows up for the end party (which is pretty amazing and should be seen on a big screen).I want to add that Cramer, Banderas and Gibson should get special mention for stellar performances and who can replace Stallone? Gibson makes a believable, multi-dimensional bad guy that's fun to watch and hate, Banderas was both bad-a$$ and funny as hell. Speaking of humor - when Arnold yelled ""Get to the chopper!!!"" I almost spewed my drink out my nose.To sum: Expendables 3 is a fun, blue collar flick that leaves you happy, gives you exactly what you hoped it would and maybe then some.",The Expendables 3

I do like them though, given time I think they could be brilliant. The first Expendables movie was good, excellent directing and Mickey Rourke was ace. The second was better; funnier, smoother and we saw a little more of Terry Crews and Randy Couture. The third film is tremendous. Snipes and Banderas blend seamlessly and Gibson was a fantastic, loony, and surprisingly fun villain. Nitpicking; Randy Couture was given another backseat role for no reason, his character is great, hilarious and sweetly tough.

I too was bummed not seeing blood and guts like in the past 2, however, this ones action scenes, fight scenes and story made up for that. Mel Gibson was the best villain of the series so far, and Wesley Snipes and Antonio Banderas were excellent additions. My only gripe about this movie, not enough Statham!!! He was in it a decent amount and had some great scenes, but definitely would have preferred a little more Statham ass-kickery. Stallone however is still the man, and did an excellent job. Randy Couture needs to have a bigger part if there is to be another sequel. His character is really growing on me, and I think his acting skills have come a long way since the first one.

The Expendables 3 brings back the awesome senseless 80's action movies that we've sadly lost. This movie shows off the bad ass movie stars doing their conventional bad ass roles. Of course there are some really corny one liners but that's what is expected in an action movie filled with old time action stars. I am very sad to see that this movie did not do well in the box office, meaning there probably will not be a 4th installment. The loss can be attributed to the piracy leak of the film before it was released, but I think people are getting sick of action movies. Edge of Tomorrow came out in June and it was the second best film of this summer (first being Guardians of the Galaxy). EOT bombed at the domestic box office making only 99 million off of a 178 million dollar budget. Jack Ryan came out in January and also bombed domestically making only 50 million dollars off of a 60 million dollar budget. Is the world sick of non-superhero action films? Sadly the answer seems to be yes. Besides Fast and Furious most action series' do not do well in the box office. Now we're stuck with sappy teen dramas that make a killing at the box office because the theaters get filled brainless teenage girls who camp out to see The Fault In Our Stars. The Expendables 3 is full of action, sure a lot of the explosions are CG (and not done very well) but if you can handle Transformers and Dawn of the Planet of the Apes then you can handle this movie. I hope the world will somehow come back to accept conventional action movies but until then we have to live with crappy teen dramas.",The Expendables 3

Sly can still write crappy lines and still have the fun for it. So for the first couple of action scenes that are amusing there are what makes the Expandables so much dang fun. But of course there has to be a plot and also new cast members. Some are OK some are absolutely terrible and then there's Antonio Banderas who is the most insane and incredible fun to be hold in this guy. And you just go with it. The original cast is still kinda there except SPOILERRRRRRR...........JET LI SHOWS UP AT THE LAST 10 minutes of the film. I am a huge Jet LI fan because he is incredible. The plot is easy to follow the action is easy to see and it has Mel Gibson. Mel Antisemitic Gibson still shows that he is the best of the best being the most bad a$$ mother flipper ever put on screen and he is just explosive and awesome. Other cast members are just there really and don't have anything else to do. So joins Wesley Snipes who they get rid off in the first 20 minutes the four new kids they get are OK at best but never spark anything other than kick jump and shoot. And it is funny because when they do get rid of the old cast very earlier Dolph Lundgren had a look on his face saying this is the only work I can get please don't kick me out. To conclude PG-13 is OK but this did nothing for the R rating before so it is not disputing to think it could have been better. John McClain left and we will see if he made a good choice and You best believe Jason Statham A.K.A. The Stath is incredible and always fantastic.

The Expendables franchise surely must be re-named - The Hasbeens who struggle to find a film, which is a pity as quite a few of the cast have had a lot of success during their life time (Mel Gibson being just one).At the end of the day this is only my take on the film, there are plenty of people (mostly brainless zombies) who really enjoy mass explosions and never empty rifle magazines.

333,super-monsters,Expendables 3 outclasses the other 2.,10,15 August 2014,"There is no doubt that Stallone and Schwarzenegger want to bring back the 80s and make todays films about action and explosions, but from the films that they have brought out in the last few years, they have drawn loyal fans who love them, and then some younger people who grew up in the late 90s watching thrillers and don't get what action films are about. They are a thrill, a ride to sit and watch and to crack open a beer with friends. The expendables 3 does just that and here are some reasons why. It not only delivers a good few laughs that actually made me chuckle in the cinema, it contained some great performances as everybody has a decent amount of screen time allowing for further character development, that made you care about them but also leaving just enough room to see the new kids doing what i would consider a FINE job. However, Stallone understands the age that he is, and this is mentioned throughout the movie, that being said, there is noticeably less action in this movie, and brilliant amount of entertaining, non-action scenes that kept me wanting more, and when the action scenes came along, they gave a really interesting and satisfying look on the movie, you kind of forget about Gibsons bad ass of a character because you become so attached to the fun. Wesley snipes as always, a great, fun guy to watch and employed his acting abilities as well as his humour into this movie and really created a character for himself that we could all enjoy. Antonio Bandaras was hilarious and created not only a comic relief character, but someone you grow to enjoy to watch after he... without any spoilers...explains about his old team, leaving Stallone's character, Barney Ross, to feel sorry for him as do the audience. Unforgiving movie goers who bash movies will spread the word of hate on this flick, if you were to rate it as an overall movie, you could pick holes in it, like any movie... but as an action flick, with some acting skills, a solid story with a love to hate bad guy, you really develop a taste for things like this after going back to thrillers and new-erra action flicks after the expendables 1 and 2, such as taken and the so on. The CGI was pretty bad, very bad in fact... and it made the audience cringe, on top of that there were some hard to understand action scenes that contained a lot of moving around and jumping and close up camera angles that you can barely see what's going on... which is typical of action films these days... ask Michael Bay, besides from a few cheesy lines and a mediocre script, each actor did their part and I came out feeling like I had a good time. 9/10",The Expendables 3
334,mihairo-62-269056,Good story bad special effects,7,18 August 2014,"This movie has the best story so far out of the series, but the (very) cheap special effects ruins it for me, it could have been a 9/10 but it's a generous 7(would have normally given it a 5 but the story is actually OK). The first two films try to combine ""unrealistic"" with ""realistic"" action and plot. This movie seems to be the most ""unrealistic"" but, as mentioned, the story is better, and it has it moments, too bad so many moments had to be in that awful, clearly, computer generated scenes. What it lacks in all other departments, it does make up for it due to the cast, although Antonio Banderas' character is a minus to the movie(a movie which tries to ""diversify"" it's audience, apparently, to angry feminists as well).",The Expendables 3
335,danielrjt,This is what an action film is supposed to be about!,8,15 December 2014,"Bullets, fighting, and explosions! Pure mayhem on DVD I personally have saw a lot of action films with terrible plots, but this one was simple but still effective, would have liked it to follow on from the other films, but oh well. I think the casting was certainly glorified! A couple (not saying who) of the headliners appeared in the film for 5- 10 minutes at the most but still made it to the cover.... Probably to draw more people to view this film. For a 2 hour film, its still all about stallone, maybe because he played a part directing or writing or whatever he did, the films need to focus on 'the expendables' after all, they're not 'the stallones'! Some fresh faces which I liked, they used them as expected, more hi-tech than the fogies but they're quite awesome. Hope there is another, but i doubt it will be better than this, maybe its about time to not go too far with these films, as its going to get boring after a while.",The Expendables 3
336,justice-91192,THE EXPENDABLES MAY HAVE SOME ISSUES ---AND THEY ARE NOT EXPENDABLE BECAUSE OF THE PROBLEMS,9,29 May 2018,"It has been absolutely clear that Sly Stallone is very talented and not a dumb boxer who gets lucky getting his face bashed in. Rambo talks in near baby-talk and sometimes all of them except the first two in each franchise WORK.
 I have not been excited to see a movie coming out in many years. Somehow I missed the Expendables as they came out-- THEN, I RETIRED. Though I fought it at first, my wasted back finally got me down. 
 I worked my way through college and retired as a recognized Addiction Specialist. In my young years-- I did not follow movies except for the ones that HAD to be seen in order to live in America.
 THE EXPENDABLES is so rough and tough and full of action that it seems to want to implode at times-- and it doesn NOT. Something saves the movie each time it starts to drag. 
 People moan at their stars AGING and it infuriates me! The men in these movies were and are ALL absolute ICONS. They are the Burt Lancasters, The John Waynes and the Eastwoods and NONE of those men except for Lancaster in THE PROFESSIONALS does a decent action film that has as much punch and as much weight as THE EXPENDABLES. These moves run FAST-- You have to watch or something will be missed--sadly sometimes it does not matter- AND this is entertaining stuff.
 These men have all given their lives to show business and they are mega millionaires. When I learned about the pay for these guys I smiled and thought-- Rocky, Lethal Weapon, Mr Universe/America, and I could go on and on.. These guys deliver just what men like to see. Men. Fighting men are needed in this dangerous world and every little boy dreams of becoming a tough guy. Many of these men were the best in sports that involve violence or tough challenges like body-building and competition. Even the Chick who is the bouncer (sorry could not find her name quickly) is a bad ass in real life and I read that she insisted on doing her own stunts. I remember when I learned that Steve McQueen actually rode the motorcycle in THE GREAT ESCAPE.. I was already a fan from THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN having him on that bike doing his thing was glorious. 
 I have to return to the age thing before I go. All of you people who make remarks about people aging-- God help you make it to old age. I can tell you that if you live-- YOU WILL GET OLD. It is one of the most frustrating things in life--eventual inevitable loss of youth and finally--for everyone, death. 
 I am SO glad that ALL of these guys got together and did this. I could watch a movie of them just standing around talking. They are our heroes and in these movies-- they remain heroes. The new faces in the movie are ESSENTIAL to bringing in new life and staying with reality. A force such as this in real life has newcomers.. a force such as this could never exist because of the physical demands and odds of dying too soon -- and new faces pop up each day in SEAL TEAM 1-1,000. New faces bring new interest, show others learning and give the old-timers a chance to teach the boys how to be men. That is one of the things that is missing is the TEACHING of their craft to the younger more inexperienced men. 
 An old western called TIN STAR shows the old Bounty Hunter teaching a young man how to be a good Sheriff and how to stay alive. It is in my top ten favorites-- it is the passing along of the secrets of the trade.
 I love these movies and love that each of these guys is showing that they have balls just to keep on doing what they do.
 Merle Haggard was a huge country Singer, Songwriter-- HE NEVER STOPPED. HE was told to do so by his doctor-- and 3 months before he died, his incredible voice was still there-- only a bit less perfect-- and that was forgiven in concert as his audience cheered his very minor mistakes or rough spots.
 He died along the highway just like he said he would in more than one song... I think these men will do the same and that is as it should be. I retired after 32 years of helping addicts. I worked hauling 240 40-pound bottles of water per day ( in the summer) and it paid the bills as I studied my craft and finally went to work helping to change the treatment field just a bit. I taught hundreds--thousands to be professional and to remember that addicts have a disease and should be treated with unconditional positive regard. THAT is what I will be remembered for and my patients will remember that I was THERE-- really THERE with them in the room.
 I think that is what we want in our entertainment--- we want it to steal us away from the perfectionism, lack of respect for those growing older, ( which is again the most ludicrous bias a human being without a fountain of youth can have) and the grind of living in a world that hurts, does not forgive easily and in the end--takes EVERYONE down.
 In a movie like (ALL of) THE EXPENDABLES, achieves that. We get to see superstars rubbing elbows and making it work. I will bet that NONE of these movies EVER flops at the box office. Wanna take that bet?

Having enjoyed both of the first 2 films I was even more pumped up about seeing this, mainly because Gibson was the villain.And yes, he delivered, great performance, but like the majority of the other actors they just didn't get the screen time they deserve. (Jet Li being the most obvious choice).I kind of felt that this film had some nice elements, good ideas with characters like Snipes, It just didn't work that well. The end 30 minutes was pretty lousy, choppy fight scenes (PG-13), sets were to dark and grey, end fight scene.... way too short!.Don't get me wrong, good fun, lots going on - great for popcorn entertainment.Overall my only memory is of Gibson, cool, psychotic and on the edge - well done Mel... keep up the good work!!",The Expendables 3

For me seeing Mel Gibson as the bad guy showed me why he is a good actor, I thought he was great as the villain. Hats off to you Mel, cause you were GREAT! Jewish run Hollywood put you out of work for getting drunk & dissing Jews, but thank god Sly Stallone put you back on film, cause you showed why you are an academy award winner. You Mel should be the Joker in the new batman movie coming out, cause you are a great actor. Yeah seeing all my past action stars aged faces made me sad, cause I'm getting old too, but seeing a mix of the old vs the new made me happy.

340,xnonamex-3,I don't really get why people hating...,9,21 August 2014,"Just to begin out I want to say that I fully enjoyed the movie. So people who go all hate on it might want to skip this... OR better yet read it and maybe I can help you see the movie in a different light ;)For the starters the whole PG-13 fuss on the web a bit ruined the movie for me. Why? Because since I KNEW that it is PG-13 I was involuntary just looking for the ""no-blood"", ""no-gore"". But truthfully if I hadn't been influenced by all the PG-13 anti-hype I would not really have noticed much difference. Because truth be told it looked all together, and how often do you really pay attention to how many drops of blood does bad guy drop when he is shot and stuff like that if it is not the prime purpose of the movie. In some movies it is a major point to make the scene more epic first that comes in to my mind: Kill Bill that scene where blood is squirting all over when you cut a head off... but it is not the case in this movie.In general the movie was all that I expected from it. It had action all the way. Macho jokes all the way. Grampa jokes all the way. It follows the track that they started in the Expendables 2. If the first expendables movie they tried to keep it more or less serious, they go all out on jokes in this one like the 2nd. But tell you what, if you actually know their background and where they come from, how they were at the peak of the glory and now that they know they are not there any more well you laugh with them... I think that is the main idea of their grampa jokes. Not to laugh about the joke itself but just to laugh with the guys on screen. And of course macho jokes - they are macho jokes. If you don't find bada*s jokes funny or entertaining - it is the not the movie for you.To people who say that there is no action in the movie, well all I can say is - I don't know what you were doing during the movie, but it barely had anything but action. Of course if you are expecting that nerve-wrecking action that you don't know how it will turn out then it is not that type of action. But nothing else can be expected - we all know that they will kill all the bad guys and come through unharmed. I think that is pretty much clear before the movie even starts. But otherwise it is action packed.About the acting and actors. The acting seemed solid. You didn't have the feeling that the actors didn't care what they are doing at the moment, which is the main thing for me (think Cpt. America 2 - just had the feeling they didn't care at all what they are doing). And of course seeing all the old dogs on the screen and that closeup of Stallone's face when he's doing his intense run... exactly what one might expect from this movie. Gibson was really good in a villain role. Banderas was absolutely ridiculous and the whole auditorium was cracking up...Of course you don't get all that much bonding with the ""new crew"", but seriously people are going for the movie because of the oldies and the new team is there just to put some fresh blood and do some action scenes that the old guys can't pull off any more.About the general plot: well, there is a plot of course. But it is what one might expect - discover bad guy, kill bad guy. The small details and inconsistencies. Well that's something that one has to live with in these movies. The small details of the plot are secondary. But in reality - when you really think about plots in most of the movies - they never really make any sense. So this is no different. Main plot idea: Be bada*s, blow stuff up.So all in all: I got what I expected and I am happy for that - left the cinema with a smile on my face. For people who want to see it: If you want chill, laid back no-brainer movie which you can just enjoy as it is - I fully recommend it. Just take into the account what is movie about and how it is presented and intended and then you will enjoy it.",The Expendables 3
341,thecomrieboy,"An overblown, overloaded two hour snorefest.",4,5 August 2014,"The Expendables 3 rolls on from the occasionally good and generally mediocre Expendables series but instead of trimming an incredibly overloaded cast adds new members into the equation with varying degrees of ineffectiveness. Director Patrick Hughes manages to undo all the improvements Simon West managed to get into Expendables 2 from the first film and as a result we are left with a soulless explosion ridden dirge of a film with virtually nothing of worth being able to be placed into the no doubt planned Expendables 4.First off, the good:Mel Gibson as Conrad Stonebanks. Although I felt short changed with the manner of his demise, Stonebanks was one of the few interesting additions to the crew. Tapping into a slightly more sociably acceptable Riggs, he managed to dominate what screen time he had- rather easily as Stallone chewed the scenery.Antonio Banderas wasn't quite as good as I expected (here was me hoping for another Assassins character) but did an effective job as the annoying smart mouth. Not his greatest role but he didn't disgrace himself.And that is pretty much it, other than the nice scene with Wesley Snipes infiltrating an enemy harbour base. The bad:Too many characters. Too many egos on set and it shows with nobody really getting a decent amount of screen time throughout the movie with the exception of Stallone. Everyone else seemed rushed and half thought out.The finale. Overdrawn, overblown and yawn inducing after ten minutes. Although there are some interesting stunts and rather nice use of a motorbike the whole scene feels like it was done by Michael Bay- explosions everywhere and yet nobody cares because the characters are so one dimensional and uninteresting, which brings me to my major and final point.There are four new characters. One is female. One is Tito Ortiz. Other than that they are all interchangeable pieces with no charisma or discernible features. Other than firing a gun early on in the film I completely forget what Tito Ortiz does. It's that dull.There will be a sequel- but it seriously better have a director who can make his mark.6/10",The Expendables 3

Never the less, I was for the most part watching, wondering what will happen next....though, having said that, you didn't have to wonder to much as you could probably guess what was coming up next. As I said before, it was all to funny but predictable. I doubt there will be a Expendables 4, all the actors are too tired, plus, they are running out of new additions.

344,mattdunsmore,"A perfectly enjoyable film, if you know what to expect",7,4 August 2014,"By now you should really know what your getting into with ""The Expendables 3"" if you've seen the previous installments in the series. If you have not seen the previous films then with an ""Expendables"" movie you should expect witty jokes, lots of action, a star studded cast filled with old and current action stars and a paper thin story which is used just to set up the next gun fight. ""The Expendables 3"" is no exception to this formula and that is not a bad thing. Although there is some problems with the formula.One thing to note about this new installment in the series is that the story is the best it has ever been. Its not Oscar worthy but its more interesting and fleshed out than the previous films. ""The Expendables 3"" see's Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) and his team of mercenaries go after an arms dealer Conrad Stonebanks (Mel Gibson) who turns out to have history with Barney and ""The Expendables"". Now Stonebanks is set out on wiping out ""The Expendables"" which forces Barney to retire his old team and recruit a new team.The cast in ""The Expendables 3"" is even bigger this time around with old favorites returning such as Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jet Li to reprise their roles as Trench and Yin Yang. Along with some great new editions like Antonio Banderas and Wesley Snipes. However the cast is just too big this time around. Lots of fan favorite characters are given very little to do and the same goes to some of the new characters. For example Harrison Ford does very little apart from tell Barney where to go and what to do throughout the film. He just feels shoehorned into the story because they couldn't get Bruce Willis back to reprise his role as Church. Also most of the new younger editions to the cast are not given anything interesting or note worthy to do apart from make fun of the older members of the cast about how old they all are and shoot a gun at random soldiers. Mel Gibson is the best villain by far in the series as he is truly menacing and really is a force to be reckoned with, but he feels underused and the film would have benefited from a good villain. What makes most great action movies great is the presence of a truly menacing villain. A few great action movies to name with fantastic villains is ""Die Hard"" and ""The Terminator"".Of course the action is the most important part of any action movie and the action in ""The Expendables 3"" is as good as any of the previous films. This film doesn't try to do anything really that new with the action but there are a couple key moments particularly in the latter half of the movie which stand out and there is plenty of witty banter between characters to entertain you between the action sequences. Although some of the special effects in the movie are horrifically bad and really take you out of the action.Over all ""The Expendables 3"" is a perfectly enjoyable film with entertaining action scenes, some incredibly bad effects which take you out of the film, a much improved story and a fine cast although there is some questionable new editions to the cast which make you wonder why they are even in the movie apart from the fact that Sylvester Stallone believes that bigger is better",The Expendables 3
345,thedeadlyprince,Suggestions to the folks who've made The Expendables series,7,13 August 2014,"1)How about working on the SCRIPT?! and yes an action movie still requires a good story. We need to feel the character joys and pains etc. We need character development etc etc.2)How about better classical action scenes?, remember Terminator 2, True Lies, Rambo 2 etc. All those movies have CLASSICAL action scenes. scenes that you easily remember way after you've seen the movie.3)How about better fight sequences? Show some slow mo some times. Audiences would love to ""PROPERLY"" follow a fight you know! Captain American The Winter Soldier shows Hollywood how it's done. Watch and learn. Or even better hire a top Asian fight choreographer like what the Wachowski's did, result The Matrix Trilogy, classical action at its best! and 4)R RATED. R RATED R RATED!!!!!!!Follow my suggestions and the result would be an actually hit movie that stands the test of time. With all those stars it should be a given.

346,oldschool85,An awesome end to the trilogy!!,9,16 August 2014,"To begin with, I sincerely don't understand why The Expendables 3 is copping as much flack as it is. The film is pure unapologetic fun and has everything (well most things) that fans are looking for. It still has the same winning formula and changes things up just enough to make it a little more fresh.So Barney Ross (Sylvester Stallone) and his team (Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Terry Crews and Randy Couture)are back again to take down former Expendable-turned-arms dealer Conrad Stonebanks (Mel Gibson). On the way, they bust Doc (Wesley Snipes) out of an armored train prison to give them a hand. When one of the team is seriously injured, Barney recruits new blood (Kellan Lutz, Ronda Rousey, Glen Powell and Victor Ortiz) to join the fight. Along the way, they pick up motor mouth Galgo (Antonio Banderas) and are then later joined by Trench (Arnold Schwarzenegger), old team mate Yin Yang (Jet Li) and CIA official Max Drummer (Harrison Ford) for all out war against Stonebanks and his cohorts.This felt like more of an ensemble piece, which means each action legend has their chance to shine and the chemistry between them all flowed very naturally . Mel Gibson reminds us why he is just one of the most awesome screen presences in cinema as he delivers a wacky and memorable performance as the main antagonist, and more than holds his own against Sly. Speaking of Sly, its amazing what he can still do physically at 68, and as screenwriter, he's put together an awesome throwback trilogy to the movies of yesteryear. Its wonderful to see him share the screen again with his Demolition Man and Assassins costars.The rest of the cast do really well, with the standout performances being from newcomers Antonio Banderas and Wesley Snipes, who steal every scene they're in. The younger Expendables do quite well also, but Kellan Lutz is the prizewinner here with his rebellious take-no-s@#t Smilee.Arnold Schwarzenegger and Jet Li have very minimal screen time but it was an action fan's wet dream to see them mow down bad guys together. Spoiler Alert - Jet Li has zero fight scenes here and most critics are complaining about this. Normally I would also, but I'd bring to light that he has been battling hyperthyroidism for a number of years, which doesn't allow one to exercise much, so this may explain it.A surprise cameo from Agent Johnson himself, Robert Davi, just adds even more charm to the proceedings. If only he broke out into Sinatra and it would've been perfect.The action sequences are really well done, particularly the finale. Does the PG-13 rating take away some of the gusto? Yes it does, but they're still very hard-hitting and it easily has the highest body count of all 3 films. An R rated DVD/Bluray will be released so fans ought to welcome that.All in all, the entire cast are fantastic in a really fun and enjoyable movie filled with the classic one-liners and self- deprecating humor we've all come to know and love.

The fact that this is just a another payday in this franchise for these actors was all too evident and one could be forgiven for thinking they seemed somewhat bored as they delivered lacklustre and often very wooden 'performances' It is poorly acted and relies heavily on a every old action movie cliché you have ever heard for it's dialogue.

348,bobballs,Lousy CG Keeps This From Being a Great Movie,7,10 October 2014,"The Good- The film opens with a good action sequence, followed by another good action sequence. Stallone keeps it fresh by having to recruit a younger team. Antonio Banderas, Kelsey Grammar, and Mel Gibson are great in this movie. Each of them will have you laughing. The script is a big leap forward in terms of dialogue and story from the other two. The banter is usually funny and the back story interesting. There is also an excellent fight sequence between Stallone and Gibson. Wesley Snipes, Schwarzenegger, Ford are also solid here. The camaraderie that the cast has built up over the course of these movies is evident here.The Bad- The biggest problem here is the sub-par CG for the film's climax. It's sub-par throughout the movie, but here, it's more evident because of the grand scale of the sequence. This leads to some logic defying stunts (even for an Expendables movie). While the set up for the final scene is good, the CG nearly ruins it making it just 'so-so'. Also, during the climax some of the fight sequences are redundant seeing the same moves three or four times. Due to the large cast it is difficult to give everyone something to do. Unfortunately, several of them are wasted here: Randy Coutre, Jet Li, and Dolph Lungren (which is a damn shame). Jet Li should not have been in this movie at all. As for the new recruits they are bland and two-dimensional.The Deal- This is a satisfying conclusion (this should be the last one) to the series. Don't be alarmed by its PG-13 rating. Plenty of people die and there is a good amount of cursing including a couple of 'F' bombs. You will be surprised by the script in this movie. The action delivers for the most part and it is surprisingly funny. If not for the lousy CG at the end, this would have been the best in the series.

351,rippetoe18,Fun action helps save an otherwise blah movie,6,7 September 2014,"Expendables 3 ReviewThe Expendables series is the only '80s style action movie series of the last decade. Featuring an all-star, testosterone-fueled cast, the Expendables 3 is reminiscent of the action movies of old. Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Terry Crews, Dolph Lundgren, Randy Couture, Jet Li, and Arnold Schwarzenegger reprise their roles from the previous films in the series to slaughter more nameless soldiers in the series' third installment. When the awesomely-named main villain, Conrad Stonebanks (Mel Gibson), wounds one of the Expendables' own, the rest of the Expendables decide to get revenge. They go after him along with some new, inexperienced recruits. The best parts about the movie are the directing and the action. Director Patrick Hughes is much more confident behind the camera and films action scenes better than the series' previous two directors in the series, Simon West and Sylvester Stallone. The action set pieces were well put together. From the opening train rescue scene to the battle between the surviving Expendables and an entire army, the entire movie exudes fun. The older Expendables get to show off their fighting skills again in this installment. However, they are absent for much of the movie, replaced by new recruits. These new recruits are not bad, but they do not add much to the movie. Another glaring problem with the series is the lack of character development. After three movies, Stallone's Barney Ross is one of the only decently-developed characters in the series. One of the newer cast members is better written and more enjoyable than most of the older ones. Antonio Banderas brings some genuine humor to the movie. Many of the other characters cracked one- liners, but most of the jokes fell flat. As a matter of fact, the biggest problem with the movie-- like the rest of the series--is the script. Stallone might have written a fantastic script with Rocky, but some of his more recent efforts have lacked. While the last movie in the series was more fun, with its tongue-in-cheek humor, Expendables 3 removed a lot of that that same humor. Nostalgia and fun action scenes help save an otherwise bad movie in Expendables 3. The 1980s had a unique action movie style. Action movies nowadays are either of the Bourne variety or involve people running around in capes and masks while they punch super-powered baddies. These movies are still good, but some action movies today lack a certain amount of fun. That's what makes Expendables 3 enjoyable. It doesn't take itself seriously and it's fun to watch. While the script and character development are bad, the action and, sometimes, the silliness make it an enjoyable action movie. Anyone who enjoys action movies of old will enjoy this action flick. It is a movie for those who miss the cheesy and over-the-top action fare. Like many previous action films, this one lacks really good filmmaking but makes up for it in its sheer fun factor. Just make sure to check your brain out at the door. 6.5/10",The Expendables 3
352,hawkfrend-875-968087,Great popcorn flick,8,5 August 2014,"I read a lot of bad reviews about this film, attacks on the script, plot and direction, so I was pleasantly surprised to find they were all wrong and they totally missed the point. I think these people were expecting Oscar winning performances but this film is about watching bad guys getting their a*s kicked. I also read that the actors seems withdrawn and bored of their roles and that is utter rubbish, and even if that were true it doesn't matter, im not interested in deep characters and meaningful performances in films like this, I just want to see lots of destruction and the bad guys getting owned.There's some funny dialogue here and there and Banderas' character had me smiling a lot.If you like action films you will enjoy this action romp, so ignore those bad reviews and grab yourself a bucket of popcorn and enjoy.",The Expendables 3

Ford, Schwarzenegger, Mel Gibson, Mr. Blade himself supplemented by Stallone, Statham, Lee and The Mask of Zorro but apart from the fact that I could see so many of the actors that I love, come together in this movie, it was disappointing to the highest level.Generic action, non-existent plot, and senseless violence (which I enjoy at times) made this movie one of the titles that I would like to forget and never refer back to again. I wish I thought otherwise, I really do! Stallone's image as a fighter in movies has always brought him much success but I believe that the time has come for him to step down because it seems like it will only go downhill from now on.",The Expendables 3

Never in the history of cinema has there been so many action stars collaborating at the same place at the same time. Adding the new (old) faces really spiced things up a bit- and needing no introduction, Roudy Ronda Rousey, and the other MMA fighter who I can't remember the name of because I was so distracted by Ronda in her red dress and full tactical gear, both being sexy as hell! The only so-called ""negative"" is the feeling of cyclic redundancy of what appears to be similar type fighting sequences rooted from previous installments (a.k.a. Barney Ross with his six shooter dispatching all the bad guys in six shots while being completely surrounded. Having said that, rest assured that you will be entertained from start to finish. Banderas saves the day with his quirkiness and comic relief, I kept thinking ""Nasonex"" every time he started talking. Some of the scenes are a ""little over the top"" but that is what action movies are supposed to be, in excess, the good guys lose in the beginning and somehow come out on top in the end (just in the nick of time). So if you can stomach a few apparent goofs with CGI, then I feel confident you will enjoy it! It does leave the possibility for another movie or even a spin off. Rousey and the new bunch have great potential in the future. My hats off to Stallone and company for creating a movie with so many famous action stars. Too bad it didn't work out for Willis.",The Expendables 3

The most beautiful aspect of the 1st two, the realistically bloody action scenes were replaced by a completely unrealistic vibe of NO BLOOD at all! If you want to see blanks just fly into people and bodys flop like the NBA, then watch this movie. I see on IMDb that Rambo 5 and Expendables 4 are announced. Please Sly make these rated R and stay true to what you are good at. The final scene of this movie would have been so cool if it had the vibe and rating of the first two.

The rest are normal *shoot, hit, jump, shoot*What I don't like:The effects in this movie, especially when they blew up the helicopter that they used to rescue their friend. I can barely see the effects on that one.The Plot the first moment I saw the picture of this movie, I kinda get already what will happened in the movie. the story line is easy to predict.Overall, I think the first expendables is still better than the second and this one.

358,Fordie97,Good Film,9,5 September 2014,The Expendables 3 is a very good film to watch and it had an excellent cast but i still prefer the First expendables film in the franchise. It has very good storyline and there is some humour in it for everyone. the reason why this film is 9 out of 10 is it is better than the second one and you can understand the conflict more easily but also the fact is that its completely different idea from the filmmakers and them taking a risk paid of for them. I would recommend people who love action films and are into a bit of warfare as throughout the film things start to build up to suspense for what comes next towards the end of film. By the way this review in no form has any spoiler alerts.,The Expendables 3
359,endorflp,Exactly what it SHOULD be,9,2 December 2014,"First of all, this movie is NOT an American classic. It is not a breakthrough in film making, not a success of vision, not a triumph of story.....heck this movie doesn't even have original content. So why do I give it 9 out of 10 stars? That is the easiest question to answer. In fact it was easier to give this film a 9 out of 10 rating than it was to come up with the opening phrases in this review! With that in mind, hopefully you as the reader, re-read (past tense re""red"") those opening lines and realized how insane they sounded. This was not by accident, but rather an attempt to remind you that the criticism of movies is often skewed. Skewed towards the idea that a ""good film"" is meant to reflect human experience and relate to the ""soul"". (see reviews for Tom Hanks movies, every cop drama, """"""based"""""" on real life films, etc.) If you are still reading this review then you are hopefully disgusted and highly annoyed. This is the point where I explain to you why ""Expendables 3"" gets 9/10...the reason is quite simple, it entertains to its target audience! Did I explain that clearly? It is ENTERTAINING!!!! This movie has one purpose, to be fun for guys age 21-50(take note of the action stars...STARS!! from the last three decades). It never gets boring, it has action, guns, knives, planes, helicopters, boats, killing bad guys, every action star you've ever watched, a beautiful girl (Ronda Rousey who is also an bad ass action star), over the top patriotism, and everything in between!This movie exemplifies the American Badass stereotype and how can you not be wildly entertained by it! Expendables 3 is one of the few films out there that doesn't try to be anything other than what it is...a kick ass, over the top action movie.....and for that it should be rated as such!!",The Expendables 3
360,louisc1987-184-556240,Slightly Disappointing entry that failed to live up to the first 2! worth a watch though,6,13 December 2014,"I was a big fan of the first expendables movie the second one i enjoyed too but not as much. Still when i saw the cast of the the third expendables i was just as excited as i was with the last movie but the thing that was missing was the fact they had too many good guy expendables and only one villain in mel Gibson that isn't known for his fight skills? I was slightly skeptical as the last one at least had van damme and scott adkins although i felt van damme was waisted with his pedigree that he possesses. After watching the expendables 3 it was far to similar to the second one, They should of gone in a different direction with a different tone and storyline instead of the same old same old. There is way too much gun shooting and explosions than actual hand to hand fight scenes which after all that is what these action stars are known for right?! Wesley snipes was good in his role but under used in his weapons department. I cant help but feel the expendables has and always will be missing the idea storyline ~ one team of good expendables going up against a team of bad expendables and going one on one with each other using there fight skills to entertain the audience! The third entry misses all of this and more. Mel Gibson was great in his role but the lack of known henchmen and his own fight skills was shown too easily. There was no need for the new young expendables after all this is meant to be a throwback to the 80's. Overall it is a fun action romp but a little of been there done that. 6/10. Disappointing in terms of the talent waisted and no where near as good as the first 2!!",The Expendables 3
361,oombutu,I hope they make 50 of these...,10,17 August 2014,"The first two installments of The Expendables I found thoroughly enjoyable. I will have to note that the Director's cut of the first one is far superior to the theatrical release, and has made me hope for something similar to happen with the second and third. The most iconic scene in those first two movies has to be the big three, Stallone, Schwarzenegger, and Willis standing shoulder to shoulder shooting as fast as they could. The screen could barely contain that shot, and I knew the third installment would have to show something serious to compete. The Expendables 3 was made for me. I am 39 and I grew up in the heyday of the action flick. Seeing these guys on screen again in this way is more than enough to spark my nostalgia reflex. But the story itself is a mirror of what every almost-40-near-midlife-crisis-has-life-passed-me-by man's man is going through right this minute. In short, it is made for the fans that grew up with these actors. And though this movie will likely get slaughtered by the critics, the simple fact is Stallone could make 50 of these movies and I would go see every single one of them with a smile on my face and a song in my heart. The newcomers aren't nearly as bad as people have been making them out to be. Ronda Rousey is not a bad actress, you can just tell she is inexperienced. She's a helluva lot better than Carano was in her debut. Little Hercules's 'I smolder with generic rage' character is kind of flat, but still entertaining. And a word has to be said about Mel Gibson. He was absolutely fantastic. Whether his trip on the shortbus to crazytown is due to his acting ability or if he is just channeling his actual personality... Doesn't matter. He is a scene stealing, vibrant SOB that sparks the most intense feelings for the viewer of anyone in the cast. Who cares if those are feelings of hatred? He's the villain, it's supposed to be like that.The scene between Gibson and Stallone in the van is an incredible sight, and I literally scooted forward in my seat at the theater to subconsciously ""get a little closer to the action."" Unfortunately there is a place where the movie falls short, and that is with the final fight between Barney and Stonebanks. It HAS to be compared to that awesome climax in the second movie with Van Damme, and this one just falls a little short. Literally short, as it doesn't take that long for Barney to put Stonebanks away. I hope there will be a director's cut that lengthens this scene, and puts a better capper on this sweet slugfest. I loved it. I can't wait for number four.",The Expendables 3
362,smanson14,Not up to par,1,16 August 2014,"First off, I really liked the first Expendables movie. The second one was good too. However, this movie did not live up the standards set by the previous two films. I never review films on IMDb.com but I felt compelled to in order to possibly save others from making the mistake I did in going to see this movie.The story was terrible, the inside jokes were forced (worse than most dad jokes), the action was predictable, and the bad guys had worse aim, leadership, and intelligence than stormtroopers. Without giving away too much all I can say is that no characters in this film ever actually use their brains. I also am still questioning my decision on not using my own brain and walking out of the theater after the first 5-10 minutes.Do not waste your money (or time) on seeing this movie in theaters. It will be on Netflix and Redbox in a matter of weeks (not the usual months).",The Expendables 3
363,laffe69,Can't believe people pay to watch this...,2,22 June 2019,"... but apparently they do, since Expendables movies get made.I like action films, mindless popcorn fun. But this isn't fun. It's ridiculous, not very clever and the action quickly gets boring and repetitive. It didn't even have any funny oneliners. Best one was Arnie saying ""get to da choppa"" but it was telegraphed a mile away so the moment was ruined.Avoid. Go see a John Wick movie instead.",The Expendables 3
364,rubibreton,All action!,6,25 August 2014,"The movie is a solid 6. It starts with action and it never ends. The storyline could have been a little deeper. One thing I did not like was the master plan to solve the problem that the characters were facing (DO NOT WANT TO GIVE OUT A SPOILER). I think it was too simple and the writers did not pay much attention to this part of the movie. Otherwise, it was highly entertaining and the comedy was great. Antonio Banderas did a great job with his character. It was extremely funny. Other characters like Arnold's was not needed. I feel like he was there just to have him in the cast but his character did nothing in the movie. In my opinion, it is a great movie when you just want to relax and watch an easy film where you do not need to think too much to understand it. It is pure entertainment for those who enjoy a simple but action packed movie.",The Expendables 3
365,jammyguystudios,It's really not that bad...,5,19 August 2014,"One of my main concerns with this movie was that there would be too many members of the team to really care about any of them and to an extent this is a small problem. Right at the start of the movie one of the team members is shot and injured and the movie really did try to make this scene very sad. But I barely knew who the guy was! I believe he was in the previous two movies but I can't really remember. I think this is the main problem with all the Expendables movies. There's too many people to care about. There are however, some major improvements to this movie over the first and second movies. The dialogue is a lot better although a little clunky at times and the acting was decent among most of the team. The movie does have a decent sense of humour with there being a couple of moments that at least made me smile. The action sequences though were not as good as the previous Expendables movies. The final action sequence in the movie was pretty well done with a couple of stand out moments especially towards the end but apart from that everything else just seems a little boring and not very well done. About half way through the film Barney picks up a new team of younger Expendables. All of actors/actresses were pretty decent apart from Smilee who always seemed to come across as bit stiff and not very enthusiastic. Now for the story which was a bit basic and slightly convoluted. Basically, The team of Expendables have to capture someone who turns out to be Stonebanks from the first movie and that's really about it. In the end Barney ends up killing him in a particularly good fight scene which in some ways makes the movie feel a bit... pointless because Barney ultimately failed his mission. The effects in the movie where decent until the final action scene where the CGI budget must have run out or something because some of the explosion effects were absolutely awful. Overall though, the movie is coherent and is an OK action film with some decent acting brought down only by the fact that there's only really one good action sequence. Would I recommend it? If you've seen the first two then I see no reason not to see it but if you haven't seen the first two then I wouldn't say it's worth it. Still not a bad movie though and it certainly isn't as bad as a 35/100 meta-score.",The Expendables 3
366,prashansedirisinghe,Disappointed,2,11 August 2014,"This probably must be one of the worst action movies ever made. Not so different from the first two movies of the franchise this one also focuses more on shooting and explosions rather than a 'plot'This is a good example which shows that without a good story-line and proper direction, even a big shot cast cannot save a movie from becoming a disaster.The only good acting I saw is of Antonio Branderus, only he seemed to have something different to offer. All the others were just playing the typical bullet proof bad-ass roles, of which we are pretty sick by now. The absence of Jackie Chan and Nicholas Cage was a huge disappointment. The battle scenes are extremely unrealistic. Its like all the villains are shooting blanks while the good guys have programmed their guns to hit the targets even without seen them.",The Expendables 3
367,NastyNecros,An action movie filled with boredom,4,31 July 2014,"I enjoyed the first two movies for what they were. They were fun rides with old actors kicking ass and making jokes about how old they are.The third installation of the series has both of those things, but, sadly, not enough. The whole reason these movies exist is for us to enjoy the nostalgia exploding through the screen while we listen to crappy one-liners and bad jokes. This movie takes itself way too seriously and, even though it tries, it just isn't self aware enough for it to work. It spends a big portion of the plot introducing a bunch of young characters pretty much no one cares about, and then it tries to make us care about those people we've never seen in our lives before. Needless to say, it does not succeed. All of a sudden we're suppose to give a damn about these one dimensional characters, and I'm not saying that the main cast has more dimensions than one, but we don't need dimension. We don't need backstory. We don't need emotion.We need to see old people doing over the top action, make old man jokes and reference their old movies. The movie just takes itself too seriously. There are jokes, but there are also dramatic moments which just fall flat. The acting isn't that good either, and neither are the new characters. It was cool to see Snipes back in action but his character was pretty much useless and didn't make any sense plot wise. Banderas was suppose to be annoying for the characters in the movie and funny for the audience, but he was just annoying. Gibson's role was pretty fun, even though he kind of just played the Joker. There's a scene taken straight from The Dark Knight, but I didn't really mind it, it was fun. Ford was just really plain and did nothing for the movie.Overall it's one of the most boring action movies I've seen. It has literally every single action movie cliché ever made, and the performances were average at best. There are also moments where the CGI is terrible and takes you away from the movie even more. I don't recommend it unless you are a big fan ( a really really big fan).",The Expendables 3

Whole movie waited for Schwarzenegger who had like 15 minutes of screenplay shooting from damn machine-gun with infinite bullets. Oh yeah, Jet Li had like 5 minutes of screenplay without a fight. There was not good fight scene even for Jason Statham. Some Youtubers make better short films than this. Plot is stupid. 3D Effects are really bad. Action scenes are for 5 year old kids.

What happened to old dudes fighting in action all the time now it's teenagers fighting. There have been many movies about young people fighting in action movies but they were all bad. The old guys weren't as much in the movie as the other two previous movies which I'm sure we all loved. Antonio vendera was one of the things that made me stay in the theater he was hilarious at all times but never would stop talking about his past.

371,antepathy,Everything you come to the franchise for!,9,19 August 2014,"This story is a bit more Barney-centric than the others, and while that limits the screen time for the others, it doesn't slow the action down.We're thrown into action from the second the film starts to the end. The action sequences, in the third of a franchise, have a lot of freight--they have to be bigger and badder than the first two movies and with such a huge cast, jumping from fighter to fighter in the larger sequences can take a bit to follow. The delightful machismo repartee is kind of cut down on because of this, but it's not gone.While Ex2 had as a theme that 'this isn't a young man's game'--that nice and innocent guys should step away before they get old and screwed up, or die, this continues along that line, with Barney deciding he's had enough friends get hurt--obviously shaken by the return of Stonebanks. This means he's forced to go with the new, and the sort of dirty-dozen intro sequence is stitched together with Kelsey Grammar's offbeat character and a LOT of wardrobe changes by Stallone. (No, seriously, a lot. O_O) And the new crew gets in a pickle and its up to the old crew--still kind of mad at Barney for cutting them out of the action, but loyal friends all the same, to save everyone's collective bacon.Stonebanks isn't an immediate world-order threat like Villain from Ex2; this is clearly personal, but with a sort of stamp of approval from the CIA=-telling line ""never do business with the government"". AND HOW! Banderas is endearing if a bit of a stereotype; Rousey is absolute ace as the token female Expendable (though there is the obligatory impractical cleavage and rape threat), Gibson is a worthy opponent, not unhinged like Villain, but cold and mean. Ford...falls a little flat, honestly. I adore the man, but his Drummer felt like he was trying to be the kind of old school badass to fit in with the other older Expendables, when really, he should have just done his own thing. I think a little more Han Solo would have worked wonders.The usual Expendables crew is absolutely wonderful, that kind of goes without saying. It's a formula, yeah, mission, complications, BIG FIGHT, end at the bar as bros with brews, but it works. And the big theme line is uttered by Luna, when she says family isn't just about blood--echoed of course by Christmas's last lines in the film.I'm hearing the DVD release will be rated R and I am excited! I don't think a PG-13 rating kills it, but I will always, always want more of Stallone's take on action heroes.",The Expendables 3

373,MajorSpielberg,"Give it a rest, Sly",3,14 August 2014,"Sylvester Stallone is a talented man as he's proved with great scripts and performances in Rocky and Rambo and he's even shown an ability to direct a solid, gritty modern action film when he puts the effort in. This script, cobbled together by three people, is a disjointed mess, the performances are just as bad, and the directing is simply lazy.I'm just going to put down my biggest gripes with this thing in list form: The two vanilla newbies are so boring and unmemorable that I can't remember the actors' or the characters' names. The rock climber and the motorbike guy...Harrison Ford is wasted as a gruff suit with no personality.The tame, PG-13 violence doesn't fit the gritty brutality each mercenary hero supposedly exemplifies.Arnold looks old and fat and tired.The 2nd-best performance in the film is turned in by Wesley Snipes.Jet Li does no martial arts.The cinematography is mostly a mess of close ups on the faces of the stars/kids someone wants to build into stars.It seems like the DP went with the old A, B, C, and D camera units for maximum coverage of each sequence, with not one of them capturing a really good angle on the action.The editing is choppy and sloppy, much like the first film, a further indicator that they shot it guerrilla style.The CGI is pretty bad, notably the fire and smoke.Bruce Willis is gone.Victor Ortiz is not really a fighter and it turns out he's not really an actor either.The one on one fight between Stallone and Gibson in the end is short and boring. Also, I was rooting for Mel to win.Antonio Banderas' role seems entirely ad-libbed... while drunk. And yet at least he has a personality of sorts.I like blood in my action movies.Randy Couture is still here for some reason.There seems to have been very little thought put into the costume design. Someone dress Arnold properly!Related to that, who got the idea that putting old guys in sunglasses would make them look younger? It doesn't.None of the so-called ""Expendables"" are expendable enough to die. Again.Frasier doesn't kill anyone.Barney Ross is a horrible character and always has been. No charisma, no humanity, no interest whatsoever.Mel Gibson, who actually does his best with the crappy material provided him, doesn't get enough screen time.Am I the only one tired of the characters' sharing their old war stories that all end the same way? As predictable as Ronda Rousey's role as the cardboard cutout action girl whose sole trait seems to be a disdain for men was, it's still disappointing.Last but not least, that stupid revolver Stallone has on his back and has to fan the hammer back like an old-fashioned cowboy really annoys me. *** So please stop trying so hard to still be COOL, Stallone. You are still cool, you're all still cool, but this is not cool. This is a slapped together star vehicle with no effort put in.

375,muhammedsahin-11-89369,"Epic cast, horrible movie",5,16 August 2014,"I was lucky to watch the movie 3 days before it came out, and my advice is to not waste money on this movie. The cast is huge and epic however the movie is horrible in every way. I give this movie a 5 for the effort put in it. The movie is so cliché in every way. In the movie, the characters are being shot at by a whole army, 2 choppers and 3 tanks and yet none of them get one scratch....... Really????? The fighting scenes are the same as the first 2 movies, bad guy kicks the crap out of the hero, and then the hero somehow manages to kill the bad guy. If you are an action guy who likes explosions and *BAM BAM BOOM KABOOYA KABOOYA* then go for it. But if you want a movie with a good storyline and good acting, please go find another movie....",The Expendables 3
376,dmorkunas1,Its not the best but definitely best of trilogy,7,8 August 2014,"This movie is best of trilogy (first one was a mix of original idea and Stallone's ego; and second one was a big pile of crap except maybe scene with Chuck Norris which was hilarious). I have just finished watching this and i can say that plot is somewhat recycled from other action movies but with help of bigger budget and a really great cast this movie looks polished very well. Some elements look borrowed from Mr Bay movies (fast action shots and smartass references) but it fits here. You can feel that macho atmosphere because every star here tries to be alpha male but that just makes dialogs not boring. Overall those two hours were worth of my time. Summary: I liked action, dialogs, fresh young characters, Gibson was good enemy, there were fun references to actors' past movies. I didn't liked that Stallone's ego is still a bit in a way, too short final fight between two leads, too little scenes of that sexy fighting chick.",The Expendables 3
377,Morbid_Q,Boring!,3,5 August 2014,"When I first saw teaser with that theme from Bridge on the River Kwai movie I was very excited, thought this movie is gonna rock, but it proved out to be dumb brainless boring action. The best thing about The Expendables is cast assemble of all those 80s and 90s action stars we all like and they even took that away. Instead they replaced them with new ''younger expendables'' no one cares about. What a waste. Action sequences were predictable and boring, movie is full with flaws and lame stuff which makes this the weakest EX movie yet. The only things I actually did like besides the presence of main stars were the return of Snipes and Gibson as villain. All in all, disappointment...",The Expendables 3

This is one among Stupid movie I ever watched, you have to be brain dead to watch this movie complete ...... nothing will happen to Expendables even if GOD come for fight .... ;-) , Hello,,,,, is there any QC check for movies?????? why people waste money and time for such movie ....Oh God..... wasted my time .... Barney (Stallone), Christmas (Statham) and the rest of the team comes face-to- face with Conrad Stonebanks (Gibson), who years ago co-founded The Expendables with Barney. Stonebanks subsequently became a ruthless arms trader and someone who Barney was forced to kill... or so he thought.

381,enquiries-81-121224,Just watch it,9,15 August 2014,"You know what. With a busy lifestyle and so much to do everyday, every now and then you just need to watch an action movie that you do not need to think too much about, that simply washes over you and puts a nostalgic smile on your face.The plot might be thin, you know it will likely come good in the end and you know that the good guy is going to win. But that does not matter a jot. It is filled with quips, familiar faces, memories of the 80's and just good fun.There will be people that hate this film as just another example of mindless violence, but who cares. It is what it is.If that is what you need, then go and see this film. I loved it.",The Expendables 3
382,waleed2016-81-234067,very good movie,9,15 August 2014,"Actually, before I saw the movie I have read some of the Feedback, but I found them Strang and bizarre!! I went yesterday to see the movie thinking it is very bad, but when I saw it I found it is one of the best movies this year!! It is like a campaign against this movie, many people say it is a bad one although it is an excellent movie. Many credits say why there are many new faces? But if there are the old faces they would say: these are old guys and should retire!! So, really nothing please such thinkers!! In my opinion, Stallone successed again and proof that he is one of the best actors of all times, although he didn't take the Oscar. I think the Oscar is like the Fifa best player (has something going on behind the scenes)!",The Expendables 3
383,rickgski,Great Movie,8,15 August 2014,"This was the best one of The Expendables Movies. Good action, story line and plot. Wesley Snipes stole the movie along with Mel Gibson as the bad guy. The opening scene with Stallone and Wesley Snipes and the Train is the Bomb. I like the mix of the new young blood in this movie. It makes me want a Expendables 4. I was hoping for a good movie and I got it. I was glued to my seat and I was not let down or bored. Then the girl in this movie surprised me. She could really fight. The other Expendable movie's 1 and 2 both together was not as good as this one. Dolf is always good. Stallone always can bring real life things of the actor and put them into the movie that gives me a laugh or a smile. 8 stars out of 10. Good Movie !!",The Expendables 3
384,altown,A much better film than you expect,8,16 August 2014,"I didn't like the first expendables. The second movie was okay. The third surprised me. I enjoyed it. It has a number of over the top set pieces, real action, little CGI. There are plenty of nods to the actors previous roles, and while it certainly doesn't take itself too seriously, there is even time for a little pathos and questioning of morality.My friends with whom I saw the film, both being women, also really enjoyed it, one of them not normally being a fan of this genre. It did feel more like the film we were promised two installment's ago.I think some of the negative reviews by movie critics is purely down to taste, and a disregard of this popcorn type of high action B movie. The editing is frenetic, but certainly not as distracting as 'Quantum of Solace'. As for the younger cast, they were fine.",The Expendables 3
385,tonycarson-84-964860,"Terrible story, sub-par action, and overall disappointing.",1,19 August 2014,"I enjoyed the first two expendables, the action was exciting, and the cast made it exciting.Going in to watch Expendables 3, although an individual offered to let me watch the bootleg, and although everyone who did watch the bootleg told me how terrible the movie was, was a gamble I was willing to take after the first two movies fulfilled my expectations.This 3rd installment was so mundane, I felt myself wanting to get up and leave the theater at times, it was boring and lifeless. The young cast members did not bring anything to the movie, and the one liners from the actors were pathetic.",The Expendables 3
386,AFRaptor,Great film for intelligent people.,7,21 August 2014,"This is indeed the best Expendables film. It wants to be recognized as an action film with a story, or a decent script. It doesn't matter if it gets that recognition or not: It's all about the attitude. These are not just a stupid bunch of guys shooting anything anywhere. The film tries to go somewhere, it has an objective. But some people, as I read in the negative comments, just wants pure action scenes the whole film.You know what? Go and make your own film.We already know it's not Oscar worthy. Can't people see that these are tribute films for the old times? You have a bunch of old action heroes just trying to have fun once again. They are the real heroes, not the modern action hero like... Depressed Robert Pattinson? C'mon! Please! This is a film for intelligent people that know how to recognized the real purpose of a movie while watching it. And yes, this is an intelligent film for intelligent people that knows how to appreciate an action gender style that is gone nowadays.",The Expendables 3
387,cwitte81,PG-13 didn't hurt. Perfect Sumner action,10,23 August 2014,"Absolutely nothing wrong with this movie. The action was great, especially in the third act. The dialogue was much more cleaned up and smoother than the last two. PG-13 did not hurt this film at all. It was action packed. If you are a child of the early 80s, you'll absolutely enjoy your time. Its not really a movie, its more of a ride/event. Ill never truly understand people complaining about an Expendables film. Really?? You need to stay away from action movies. Bandares was hysterical in this movie and Snipes is a great addition as well. Mel Gibson's acting chops are still there. His deliveries are perfect. Excellent performer. Seeing Harrison Ford and Arnold Schwarzenegger together in action scenes was great to watch. Such a fun film. Best of the series. I will get this the day its released on blu ray and I'm not giving this 10 out of 10 just to annoy the hater, I am really giving this a 10.",The Expendables 3

390,stefanbacci,Third time is a charm,10,19 October 2014,"First of all, I must say that I am surprised that many people didn't like this movie. I personally thought it was the best in the series. ""the plot is too thin, the lines are stupid and the humor does not exist, like in the first two movies."" That's what I've read of them, most critics and fans (surprised). I actually think it was good that this movie had a more serious tone. All actors do a great job, well made ​​action scenes and great job by the director. Mel Gibson and Sylvester Stallone's scenes were actually surprisingly good! Would have liked to have seen more scenes with Dolph Lundgren and Randy Couture. A minus for the film: far too long final scene. Far too long and could have been shortened ten minutes. Sly wanted Mel Gibson would have directed the film in the first place. In fact, I hope that he gets the job Expandebles 4.",The Expendables 3

The movie gets me on the edge of my seat to see what happens next. Hope there are other movies for the expendables to come in the future. I really enjoy the action movies with Sylvester Stallone, Jason Statham, Dolph Lundgren, Jet Lee and the rest of the crew. Sylvester Stallone knows how to write the script well for the movies that he has for all of his movies. He knows who to get and which character plays well. The movie the expendables i would rate a 10 being excellent movie. I would which the movie over again. I can't wait to see what next big movie comes out.",The Expendables 3

In the very beginning of the movie when they met Stoneback, they've shot him easily and thus end the movie in 20min. Everyone knows this could not be happened, however, the director goes the most stupid way to prevent the controversy of this scene, he arrange a most silly way to mess up everything. Idiot cannot live, every action movie which want to break through this rule should got a big rotten tomato. In this film, the scene of Sylvester Stallone is filled with stupidity and ridiculousness. The arrangement of his action should render him death at the beginning, but not, hence we have suffer from this stupid, useless char through out the movie. Every second to see his appearance is intolerable.",The Expendables 3

Want Forgettable Plots? Check.What sets Expendables 3 apart from it's prior installments is the pacing this time around. Those who say Expendables 3 is boring clearly have not a clue about these types of films. You have plenty of action and crazy comedic humor throughout. Expendables films are never to be taken seriously nor are Oscar worthy. Films like expendables are just action films with very little plot but that is why I like these Expendables films as it's made for the action fans and for those gag laughs found within.Lastly, make no mistake. Expendables 3 is solid and action packed. I won't spoil the movie for you as you will just have to go and see it for yourself.",The Expendables 3
394,wrickdavis,Really???,2,19 July 2015,"I thought the first movie was very entertaining, the second was okay. The third was just plain bad. Mel was the best part of the movie, the rest was just horrible. Although Snipe's reference to tax evasion is funny. Most of the actors you want to see are on for a mere moment. The addition of the young crowd was not needed and takes away from seeing the old actors from the 80s. There are so many expendables at the end, apparently everyone is expendable. The only part that deserved 5 stars is when, in the background of the motorcycle scene, you can see Henry Winkler jumping over a large tank with a shark fin sticking out of it. I can only imagine how bad Expendables 4 will be. I guess some people will do anything for money, even sell their integrity.",The Expendables 3
395,chathamjason,Created IMDb account for this,1,11 August 2015,"RUN AWAY!!! This movie is so painfully awful that, out of an obligation to humanity, I registered just to warn others. I have been a passive user of IMDb for years but this broke it for me. I am compelled to cry out in the soul-sucking wilderness that is 'popular' culture. How far have we fallen? This has to be the most concentrated, cynical bucketful of Hollywood dog squeeze that I have ever seen. At the same time it is a profound window into exactly how sick we have really become. We are so numbed by the non- stop 'entertainment' that we allow the demons who run these studios to still label this as 'entertainment'!I did not seek this movie out for any particular reason (plus netflix variety sucks as usual) or have any real expectations other than cheap entertainment (I mean it's punch drunk rocky as the lead for goodness sake) but I feel like my soul has been freeze dried. How can Americans no, scratch that, humans, still think fondly of ourselves at this point (if we still think at all)? How can Satan worshiping Hollywood make a ninety minute explosion-porn/energy drink commercial (complete with awkward Rhoda Rousey's nearly man-like torso/tits) with a straight face, knowing it will return millions? Because we don't boycott it! We really are in the matrix people........run away if you still can.",The Expendables 3
396,brianweitman,Great movie. Ending could of been better,8,7 September 2015,"I loved the movie. Great action, really like the twist of getting a new team, then the old team coming in, joining with the new and whipping some ass. Stallone is still a bad ass and even though not one of the best actors, will always be one of my favorite. BUT, I do not like how they tried to be P.C. and have a gay moment at the end with Arnold and Jet. It ruined the movie for me. I don't believe, never have, nor never will believe in being politically correct. That part of the movie was very disappointing to me. All the Expendables have been about comradery, bloodshed, and just plain kickin' ass, 3 did not let down in that aspect, until the end. I frankly am getting tired of all the gay stuff being in the media and now in movies to make them acceptable for all viewers.",The Expendables 3

I haven't seen it yet already, I saw only 50 minutes so he may appear later I hope... But if he doesn't appear than it is a really stupid idea to make this movie without him...
