0,Leofwine_draca,Solid - and profane - Bruce Willis vehicle,8,16 August 2016,"A typical crime thriller in the vein of many '90s films, giving us clichéd characters and plenty of action, with little plot or character development. Despite having a predictable premise of two characters who initially hate each other, team up and grow to love one another, this film benefits from some good acting from Willis and Wayans. Willis plays the character role he was stuck with in the early '90s, basically the washed-up alcoholic cop (talk about typecasting...), but he plays it very well indeed and frequently manages to be very funny. Wayans, on the other hand, gives a very compassionate and likable performance. The chemistry between the two actually works for a change and this makes the film, as a whole, a lot easier to bear.The plot twists and turns for a bit while our heroes try to figure out who's responsible for a murder of a friend while in the mean time avoid being killed. The action scenes come fast and violent - just the way I like them. There are plenty of impressive moments, such as Willis killing an opponent with just one punch, or a stunt where a car flies over a house before landing in a swimming pool. The only negative point in the film - aside from the unoriginality that is - was the excessive and laboured swearing, which seemed a bit forced (unlike in RESERVOIR DOGS, where it seemed at home). Stick around for the excellent climax which has Willis battling the chief villain on top of some scaffolding at a football game. Otherwise, this is solid entertainment, even if we have seen it all before.",The Last Boy Scout
1,SnoopyStyle,Attitude over Substance,7,23 August 2015,"L.A. Stallions running back Billy Cole gets a threatening phone call. In the game, he starts shooting and kills himself. Private eye Joe Hallenbeck (Bruce Willis) was once a heroic Secret Service agent. His wife is cheating on him with his work partner Mike Matthews. He punches Mike once but still wants his works. Mike's car explodes after giving Joe the job to protect stripper Cory (Halle Berry). Cory's boyfriend is former L.A. Stallions star quarterback Jimmy Alexander Dix (Damon Wayans) who was banned for gambling and drugs. Hit men kill Cory and Joe works to solve her murder with Jimmy and Joe's young foul-mouthed daughter Darian (Danielle Harris). It is attitude over substance. Tony Scott fills it with slick explosive action. Willis and Wayans form a sarcastic cynical duo. The case doesn't really matter and is forgettable as soon as it's revealed. It's the two characters tearing their way through L.A. Danielle Harris comes in to swear up a storm. This may be a good character for Willis to revisit.",The Last Boy Scout
2,classicsoncall,"""We've been beaten up by the inventor of Scrabble.""",7,14 May 2006,"Wildly implausible plot elements are standard fare for ""The Last Boy Scout"". No, no, I don't mean the corrupt Senator or the megalomaniac sports team owner, those are pretty much the norm for action films because they occur with such regularity in real life. I'm talking about a hard boiled private detective who escapes death with a monologue of fat jokes, and a thirteen year old daughter who makes a save with a handgun in her puppet. They just don't make 'em like that anymore.The thing is, if you want to be critical, this movie provides enough fodder for serious thrashing. However if it's a fast paced action adventure wrapped around a spirited buddy pairing, then you'll find it here, all wrapped up in quick one liners and snappy banter between Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans. The duo seems to share a monumental detachment from tragedy in their own lives and a commitment to provide the same for the opposition. But gee, how do you manage to walk around at the end of the day if you've been pummeled as much as these guys have?Halle Berry fans will have to pay attention during her brief screen time; her demise in the film is not a pretty picture. Taylor Negron is notable as a sadistic hit man, which reminds me of another implausible plot point. Just on the off chance that he might have survived the car crash into the pool, why would Joe Hallenbeck (Willis) leave his daughter there with the homeowner? I guess the question's not so rhetorical, it's so she could be kidnapped to advance the story into the football stadium for the next round of mayhem.For Bruce Willis, this could have been with some modifications, an entry in the ""Die Hard"" series, as many of his films could be. His character generally remains the same from picture to picture, but if you're a fan, that's OK. The film earns it's title with the squeaky clean personal code of it's lead hero, reinforced by an autographed sports card from Wayan's character signed ""To the daughter of the last Boy Scout"". Be prepared!",The Last Boy Scout
3,rmax304823,Formulaic Actioner.,4,18 March 2012,"There isn't much point in going on about this strictly routine action thriller about two mis-matched revenge-motivated partners in pursuit of the mob while being hunted by the police. If you haven't seen it before, it's because you haven't seen ""Lethal Weapon"" or ""Die Hard."" There's even a scene lifted from ""Chinatown."" I think the original model for all of them must have been the morally exhausted couple of private detectives in ""Hickey and Boggs."" ""The Last Boy Scout"" steals more from ""Lethal Weapon"", except here it's the white guy who has a family, a dysfunctional one with a foul-mouthed daughter. The usual wisecracks are all present or accounted for, even when both heroes are about to be murdered. This is more sour than ""Lethal Weapon"" though. The smart talk doesn't do much to relieve the pervasive gloom.The head of the gang of evildoers is a jovial and sadistic Texan who bribes officials and fixes football games. His chief goon is a lisping homosexual who threatens to rape a thirteen-year-old girl. Nobody smiles, although they sometimes laugh stupidly at the bravado of the protagonists.On the plus side, instead of a car chase, there are TWO -- count 'em, two -- car chases: one through the woods, another down a Los Angeles freeway. One of the cars does a couple of twists through the air, sails over the roof of a house, and lands upside down in a middle-class pool. The fact that it is underwater doesn't prevent it from exploding. What would a car chase be if it didn't wind up in a fireball? The gay villain who is inside the demolished burning car under the water upside down nevertheless survives, because the script needs him for the climactic shoot out at the football game.I'm not trying to lay out the plot in any sort of logical sequence. What would be the point? Not even the writers have bothered to do it.",The Last Boy Scout
4,Tweekums,Decent if cliché '90s action,7,25 October 2017,"Joseph Hallenbeck is a Los Angeles private detective who left the US Secret Service under a cloud after striking Senator Calvin Baynard; Jimmy Dix is a former American Football quarterback who was kicked out of the game for gambling offences this unlikely pair find themselves working together when the woman Joe was hired to protect, Jimmy's girlfriend, is murdered. They are both determined to get to the bottom of what happened. They discover that she had incriminating evidence that linked local football team owner Shelly Marcone and Senator Baynard concerning an investigation into the legalisation of gambling of sports in the US. The evidence is destroyed but it points them in the right direction and soon they, along with Joe's teenage daughter, Darian, are in considerable danger.If one was in any doubt that this was going to rather over the top the opening scene will dispel those doubts the sight of a professional football player pulling a gun and shooting several opponents before killing himself was almost laughable. We then get a story full of clichés; the mismatched characters who bond over the course of the series, bad guys dispatched with witty quips and a hero's daughter caught up in events at first these clichés are mildly irritating but as it progresses they become amusing as one spots each new one. This may all make this sound like a poor film but ultimately it is rather fun there is lots of great action with shootings, explosions and even a bad guy getting sliced-and-diced as he falls through a helicopter's rotors! Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans put in solid performances as Joe and Jimmy. Halle Berry puts in a nice little performance, in an early role, as Jimmy's girlfriend; it was a pity her character was killed so soon. Young Danielle Harris also impresses as Joe's daughter, a character who could easily have been irritating. Overall this isn't really a classic but if you like '90s action it is certainly worth checking out.",The Last Boy Scout

6,hitchcockthelegend,"You know, for a dancer, he is one hell of a detective.",8,5 April 2020,"Written by Shane Black and directed by Tony Scott, it's not the biggest surprise in the world to find that ""The Last Boy Scout"" is full of high octane action and serious one liners. Plot has Bruce Willis as a private detective whose protected female witness (Halle Berry) is murdered, prompting him and the victim's boyfriend - a disgraced gridiron star (Damon Wayans) - to investigate the crime together and all roads lead to the higher echelons of American Football.There's shades of ""Die Hard"" here, but really it's unfair to simply put it in the cash in on an action classic genre. Anyone who knows Shane Black's career will know that plot is secondary to action and dialogue, more so when Tony Scott is on directing duties. This may actually be Black's most under appreciated literary work (though it was a box office hit), his buddy buddy formula, that was so brilliantly realised with ""Lethal Weapon"", really shines here - making it Wayans' best work and Willis' most laconic.It's all a bit blokey, meaning that unless the girls watching are in it for the stars alone, they are sure to be disappointed by the machismo washing over the female characters of the piece. But this is electrifying stuff, both visually and orally. It's fun and thrilling, so strap yourself in and enjoy the ride. 8/10",The Last Boy Scout
7,Hey_Sweden,"Water's wet, the sky is blue...and this movie rocks.",8,19 June 2012,"Co-writer Shane Black of ""Lethal Weapon"" fame returns to the same territory with this often grim and seedy ""buddy"" action movie that also has a great levity to it, with some priceless quips that let us know that the movie isn't taking itself seriously all the time. Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans make for a fine team, respectively playing a sullen, boozy private eye and a disgraced former pro quarterback. Fate brings them together so they can take down the nefarious criminals attempting to legalize sports gambling, and planning on assassinating the one dirt bag politician who stands in their way. There are some melodramatic sequences, to be sure, but they do help us understand where the characters are coming from. The strongest aspect to the movie is the repartee between the two stars, who do as much male bonding as they do crime fighting. Willis is perfect for his part, and Wayans proved himself capable of good dramatic work here. The top notch supporting cast is full of familiar faces, with Noble Willingham and Taylor Negron, the latter usually associated with comedic roles, a delight as the nasty bad guys. It's hard to knock any movie featuring the likes of Danielle Harris, Halle Berry, Bruce McGill, Kim Coates, Chelcie Ross, and Joe Santos, among others. The movie is often incredibly violent, but we action fans just wouldn't have it any other way. Hell, we know we're in for a good time right from the start: after some amusing cheesy nonsense with the opening credits / musical number by Bill Medley, there's a grabber of an opening, featuring Billy Blanks as a quarterback right on the edge. Directed in typically stylish fashion by Tony Scott, this is just a lot of fun, leading to a lively climax at a football stadium. In the end, it serves to remind us, in the same manner that ""Commando"" did a few years previous, that roughing up / killing a bad guy just isn't the same without an appropriate witticism for the occasion. Eight out of 10.",The Last Boy Scout
8,LeonLouisRicci,Vulgar and Violent,9,24 March 2013,"This is a somewhat overlooked Action/Buddy Movie that is one of the best of its kind. It probably got lost in the glut of style that proliferated the 80's and 90's. But it is amazingly entertaining and holds up fine on repeated viewings.Director Tony Scott and Writer Shane Black remind one of Mickey Spillane, one of the most successful Writers ever. It's in your face and is anything but subtle, intelligent, profound, or insightful. Just damn fun and highly popular. It is not so much dumb down as it is a combination of trailer-park and shopping mall friendly.It is Hard-Boiled and gruff, yet easily digested and dream like. There is much here to laugh out loud and cringe with delight. This is one of Bruce Willis' best Movies and same could be said for Tony Scott. There is locker-room humor and searing violence and it is all attractively ugly and has wide appeal. One could quibble about Joe Hallenbeck's hypocrisy. He hates Rap Music but loves the prefabricated junk like the Four Freshmen and Pat Boone. He tells Jimmy that he doesn't do drugs and he gets by, as he lights another cigarette and drinks to oblivion. But who is quibbling. This is the poster child for all the testosterone, not politically correct, violent, foul mouthed, hard R rated, stuff that made Billions in the age of Reagan and Clinton. Polarizing Presidents that this last boy scout would have protected with equal enthusiasm in an era when ""fast forward eats the tape"" and audiences ate up this kind of stuff with enthusiasm as well.",The Last Boy Scout
9,poolandrews,Highly enjoyable 90's foul mouthed violent comedy action thriller.,8,24 December 2008,"The Last Boy Scout is set in Los Angeles where Joe Hallenebeck (Bruce Willis) works as a private detective, Joe gets a call from his best friend & fellow private detective Mike Matthews (Bruce McGill) offering him a job protecting a stripper named Cory (Halle Berry). Later that morning Joe discovers that Mike is having an affair with his wife Sarah (Chelsea Field) but still accepts the job since he needs the cash, while keeping an eye on Cory he is attacked & knocked out & Cory is shot dead in front of her ex pro-football player boyfriend Jimmy Dix (Damon Wayans). Affter being let go by the cops Joe & Jimmy team up to find out the truth behind Cory's murder & they discover a plot to legalise sports gambling & an attempt to assassinate a US senator. Up to their necks in trouble with people trying to kill them left, right & center as well as the cops after them Joe & Jimmy decide to save the day & take the bad guy's down...Directed by Tony Scott I will openly & freely admit that I have a real soft spot for The Last Boy Scout, I just think it's almost perfect at what it sets out to do & I find it a very entertaining film to just sit down & watch. I must have seen The Last Boy Scout a dozen times or so over the years & it never fails to entertain or make me laugh & there's not many films out there I can say that about, for instance I recently saw Face/Off (1997) again for the first time in years & I was extremely disappointed by how dull it was & that it just wasn't anywhere near as good I remembered it but watching The Last Boy Scout again last night it was definitely every bit as good as I remember it from when I first saw it all those years ago. There are several reasons why I like The Last Boy Scout so much, for a start it's one of those infinitely quotable films full of filthy foul mouth one-liners that are genuinely funny & never fail to at least raise a smile. The action is very violent & at times maybe a little too much emphasis is given on hurting people but the set-pieces which include car chases, shoot-outs, fights & explosions are fun & varied enough to stand out. The plot is a little weak & the main story about a corrupt senator & a businessman trying to legalise gambling is a bit lacklustre but the character's really make it work. Joe Hallenbeck the down on his luck, bitter & cynical detective is great as the hero, he has his flaws but that's good & you do end up really liking the guy by the end of the flick while the Jimmy Dix character is a more clichéd black partner to bounce jokes off type of guy but he holds his own & he too also becomes rather likable by the end although he never seems that upset about witnessing the love of his life Cory get viciously gunned down in front of him. The Last Boy Scout is a mix of some of the best bits & ideas from classic action flicks like Beverly Hills Cop (1984), Lethal Weapon (1987) & Die Hard (1988) but that's no bad thing, I mean if your going to steal you might as well steal from the best, right? The bad guy's aren't that good or overly memorable but nothings perfect I suppose.The films pace is a little slow to start with but the funny one-liners come thick & fast to keep one entertained. The violence is often excessive & there's a lot of killing, punching & general hurting of people. The action scenes are fairly well done although I am not sure how a car ends up falling straight down into a pool when it clearly has forward momentum as it launched itself off the roof of a house. The film is full of profanity & bad language so if you don't like swearing The Last Boy Scout is not the film for you although I never got the impression that it was swearing for the sake of swearing & most of the profanity is very funny. Apparently the original script was quite different as the entire last third of the film was to be set on water & Hallenbeck's grudge again the senator (who was the President in the original script) was different & the senator's son Louis (who isn't even in the final shooting script) was to be one of the main villains.Obviously blessed with a decent budget the production values are high & it's well made. Apparently music composer Michael Kamen hated The Last Boy Scout when he first saw it & only wrote & provided the score for it because of his personal friendship with Bruce Willis & producer Joel Silver. Bruce Willis is a likable guy & he was just born to lay these foul mouthed wisecracking hero types & puts in a great performance here while his buddy buddy partner Damon Wayans does fine too although I think a young Danielle Harris is also great as Joe's foul mouth daughter with an attitude.The Last Boy Scout is a real guilty pleasure from the 90's that holds up extremely well even today, it's go some great action, some hilarious one-liners that are guaranteed to have you quoting them to your mates & Bruce Willis probably the best action film star of recent times & any film that kills off the supremely untalented Halle Berry has got something going for it.",The Last Boy Scout
10,lastliberal,"The sky is blue, water is wet, women have secrets.",7,5 November 2007,"Count on Bruce Willis (12 Moneys, The Siege, The Jackal) to make another good action flick. Teamed up with Damon Wayans, who added the comic relief, this flick was most enjoyable.Tony Scott (Man on Fire, Domino, Beverly Hills Cop II, Enemy of the State) knows how to make action flicks and he did a good job with this one, even though the story was a bit thin.Danielle Harris (Halloween 2007, Halloween 4, Halloween 5) was just so cute as Willis' 13-year-old daughter.This is type-cast for Willis as he plays the cool cop/PI like no one else can since Dirty Harry.",The Last Boy Scout
11,zardoz-13,Terrific Urban Shoot'em Up with Willis and Wayans,9,25 March 2011,"""Top Gun"" director Tony Scott's adrenaline-laced, testosterone-fueled, high-octane actioneer ""The Last Boy Scout"" qualifies as an ultra-violent, hideously misogynistic, hard-boiled criminal melodrama about an unlikely pair of pals who thwart a gang of sinister, trigger-happy thugs who advocate sports gambling legalized. These slimy villains are prepared to pay millions to achieve their goal, and they have no qualms about killing anybody who interferes with their plans. The heroes are a hard-boiled private eye who once served as a Secret Service agent and took a bullet for President Jimmy Carter and a former professional football quarterback with a million dollar throwing arm banned from the game for gambling. Typically, the director is considered the auteur, and Scott delivers his signature touches: rapid-fire editing, gauzy-looking shafts of illumination back-lighting doors, windows, staircases,etc., and the alternation of telephoto shots with looming close-ups. Indeed, ""The Last Boy Scout"" emerges as a glossy, slickly-produced epic, and Scott stages everything with style and aplomb to spare. The downtown shoot-out at a strip joint rivals anything in an early Steven Seagal movie. Scott thrusts you into the thick of the action without going overboard. Mind you, the explosions are massive fireballs of black smoke and orange flames. In this respect, Tony surpasses his famous older brother Ridley at delivering orgasmic action scenes. Ridley, however, has achieved greater critical and commercial success. Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans constitute the unlikely, interracial heroic duo, and their friendship gets off on a contentious foot before they set aside their feelings and deal with the obnoxious villains who are capable of the worse violence. Nevertheless, the real auteur of ""The Last Boy Scout"" is ""Lethal Weapon"" scribe Shane Black. Black is attracted to direct opposites. Consider the ""Lethal Weapon"" franchise as well as ""Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang."" Remember the suicidal Mel Gibson detective who is teamed up with the pragmatic Danny Glover. These two were as different as night and day, with Glover as the night and Gibson as the day. In ""Kiss, Kiss, Bang, Bang,"" an actor and a gay private eye team up to take on the villains. Happily, the tough but sympathetic heroes in ""The Last Boy Scout"" never get a break, and they have a disarming way of handling their setbacks. Black's crude but witty dialogue exchanges between the hard-nosed Willis and the articulate Wayans undercuts a lot of the hard-as-nails gritty action. Quite possibly, anybody who has trouble hearing the repetitious use of the F-word will find this dialogue offensive. Meanwhile, Willis and Wayans generate charisma galore as they play off each other. Black's twists and turns in the narrative, his clever use of foreshadowing, and the wicked villains make this vigorous, 105-minute, mystery yarn entertaining to watch. Indeed, everything is by-the-book, but Black skillfully presents these conventional elements in such compelling fashion that you can overlook their formulaic origins. One of the funniest scenes in ""The Last Boy Scout"" occurs early on when our beleaguered hero comes home to find his wife cheating on him. He knows that something is amiss when he catches a glimpse of the commode in the bathroom with the seat raised. Anybody who has lived with a woman for any length of time knows that they hate it when a man leaves the toilet seat up because they may sit down and fall into the commode.This stylist, slam-bang shoot'em up ranks as one of Scott's better efforts. He turns everything into a larger-than-life situation. Nobody can dispute that ""Top Gun"" and ""True Romance"" show Scott at the top of his game. ""The Last Boy Scout"" is gripping from start to finish.",The Last Boy Scout
12,Calicodreamin,Good action flick,6,13 November 2019,"Bruce Willis shines as a beat down PD who inadvertently hooks up with an ex football player to take on the big money in town. His character is right along the lines of die hard, so he plays it well. Willis and Wayans have good chemistry as the unlikely duo, and keep the humor and action coming. The storyline didn't flow very well, some scenes felt out of place (what was that beginning part all about?!). Overall it was a mindless action flick with some good humor and good acting.",The Last Boy Scout
13,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"""You even look at her funny, I'll stick an umbrella up your ass and open it.""",7,22 November 2017,"Football is ravaged by scandals. ""No heroes left"". Can Sarcastaball be far off? Disgraced player Jimmy(Wayans, funny, and charming if not as easy-going as other roles of his) is insulted that ""outside protection"" is hired by his girlfriend Cory(Berry, sultry, sweet). As such, he gets off on the wrong foot with former Secret Serviceman Joe(Willis, washed-up). Well, most people do. He gets no respect. Not from his ex-colleagues, his wife, daughter, etc. Both leads are down-on-their-luck losers who are still tough, bad-ass guys. And they're going to have to start trusting each other, even if they don't want to. For the woman they are to keep safe.This is a classic, an excellent buddy comedy. I don't think Robert Rodriguez watched very much of this before he decided Bruce should play Hartigan. Heck, maybe Miller watched this before he wrote it. Not sure why he didn't go with Halle for Nancy. Then again, nobody knows why he went with Jessica Alba. But I digress. This has 102 f-words, that's an average of 1 per minute of this 1 hour, 41 minute movie. Or 37 if you don't count the end credits. And I loved every second. There is a ton of machismo in this. Several shootouts and explosions. Dozens of deaths, including stand-out ones for a select few. Tons of violence inflicted and/or threatened. It's very clearly directed by Tony Scott(with his inimitable style, its visual flair), and written by Shane Black(countless quotable quips. Memorable pairs of goons). This is realistic on drugs, football and gambling.I recommend this to anyone who enjoys action flicks. 7/10",The Last Boy Scout
14,AaronCapenBanner,A Guilty Pleasure,7,2 December 2013,"Tony Scott directed this true guilty pleasure that stars Bruce Willis as cynical private detective Joe Hallenbeck, who gets involved in the case of disgraced former Pro Football player Jimmy Dix(played by Damon Wayans) who is a murder suspect who insists on his innocence. Joe quickly realizes that Jimmy is telling the truth, as they both become the repeated targets of assassins and kidnappers, and even dragging Joe's wayward young daughter(played by Danielle Harris) into the mess, which also involves a politician who had ruined Joe's former law enforcement career... Though trashy and foul-mouthed, this film is surprisingly entertaining, with a most amusing performance by Willis and a rousing ending(and opening for that matter!)",The Last Boy Scout
15,FlashCallahan,He calls me Joseph.....,10,23 January 2011,"When the girl that detective Joe Hallenback is protecting gets murdered, the boyfriend of the murdered girl (ex-football player Jimmy Dix) attempts to investigate and solve the case. What they discover is that there is deep seated corruption going on between a crooked politician and the owner of a pro football team....There is only one one action movie better than this, and that also features Willis, but in a skyscraper.The years have been unkind to the film, but the script and the one-liners are still as fresh as the cold day in February that this was released in the UK. Willis has never been more oafish and sloth like, and he is a highly unlikable character with an unlikeable family, but you quickly warm to him when you realise he is just another average Joe who has been dealt a bad hand by life.So it's understandable that he's a little bitter and impatient with people. On the other hand, Wayans gives a 'career' best performance as cocky guy Dix, but seeing as he was in classics such as Mjor Payne and Blankman, it doesn't really justify anything.As expected, being directed by Scott and Produced by Silver, you are not going to discover subtlety anywhere in this film. Random bad guys pop up from nowhere (scrabble man) and every set piece gets more and more ridiculous.The story and script by Black is great, but there is one moment that I wished he'd left out (when Dix discusses his deceased wife and child), there was no need for it, and it felt out of place and stuck in for added emotion.But other than that, it's a colourful original and very funny film, with great chemistry from the two leads, and some delicious bad guys.The epitome of nineties action, there wasn't a good action film for at least another five years, and that was basically die hard on a plane.If you are a Willis fan and haven't seen this, you are not a Willis fan.A must",The Last Boy Scout
16,Aaron1375,Die Hard with hard hitting football and cheerleaders!!!,8,14 April 2010,"Yes, this film has a lot in common with the Die Hard franchise as it has lots of action, some humor and of course Bruce Willis. His character in this one is a lot like John from the Die Hard, though instead of a cop he plays a private eye who used to be a secret service agent that once took a bullet for a president. He lost that job though thanks to a crooked politician and now he is only a shadow of his former self and he is having marital problems. Playing opposite Bruce Willis is Damon Waynes who is playing a former quarterback who had to leave the league thanks to substance abuse problems. The unlikely duo come together thanks to a gig that has Willis on a bodyguard assignment for a girlfriend of Waynes. The girlfriend is none other than a young Halle Berry so you get quite a few stars in this one. She is killed rather early though so the two end up forming a partnership to find out why she was targeted for death and what they find is a lot of action. Like I said the action is rather good, but what really makes this one is the rather dark edged humor as there is a funny scene where Bruce basically tells a guy he is going to kill a guy who hits him. You also see him turn a gun on someone that is really dark, but funny as well. Waynes is rather good in this one and I have to wonder why he never really appeared in other more mainstream movies, as he and Willis had some good, funny scenes together. The ending is particularly satisfying.",The Last Boy Scout
17,SimonJack,"A film of raw, vulgar, incoherent mayhem",5,26 November 2016,"The only reason I give this Bruce Willis film five stars is for the action and special effects. Otherwise, this is a mayhem movie of over the top gore and violence, crudity, foul language and vulgarity. The plot for ""The Last Boy Scout"" is a twisted and complicated mess. The film gets into everything from politics and crooked politicians, to major sports corruption, to drugs, sex, and government cover-ups. You know the movie is going into the realm of fantasy or sci-fi when a pro-football player is juiced on drugs and then runs the football carrying a gun and shooting down three defenders on the way to the end zone. I think the writers of this one might have been on the juice themselves – powder or liquid. As for acting and directing, how could one tell? It was constant mayhem, beating, shooting, running, etc. to the point that it was hard to follow any semblance of a plot. This is a far cry from the Die Hard films that have a simple plot and then build around it with tremendous action, special effects and clever solutions. Yes, they have violence – but not of the gore type, nor the crude, vulgarity of wild animals. This is one most people should skip unless you want to study what not to do and how not to make a film that would have wide audience appeal. I saw this movie in its theater release, but it had been so long ago and I couldn't remember much about it. So, I watched it again recently and it was soon apparent why I couldn't remember much about it. It definitely is a forgettable film.",The Last Boy Scout
18,Mr-Fusion,"Vulgar, violent and not ashamed of it",7,15 October 2013,"""The Last Boy Scout"" is a heady mixture of things that work beautifully and those that really don't. For one, it's a pretty great action movie, though it's set to the tune of a sports gambling story that isn't very interesting (pfft, football). And I was never crazy about the hazy prism of Tony Scott's directorial vision; the dude really likes his smoky rooms, but it doesn't always work (not too well here, either). Willis, for his part is perfectly cast as the cynical, down-n-out wisecracking action hero; you'd think this was written just for him. It takes you back to a time when the guy had undeniable charisma. Man, those were the days.But the beauty of this movie lies in the script, specifically in Shane Black's terrifically self-aware dialog. And the lines between Willis and Wayans (not to mention everyone else) are so snappy, they just hit the ear like candy. And it hits all the right notes for a great action movie: shootouts, car chases, explosions, fistfights, and just scads of one-liners. All in all, a great empty-calorie movie snack. 7.5/10",The Last Boy Scout
19,MovieAddict2016,Some of the best one-liners ever in an enjoyable action yarn,7,17 May 2005,"The Last Boy Scout is loud, vulgar, trashy  and great entertainment. Bruce Willis plays Joe Hallenbeck, a disgruntled former Secret Service agent struggling with personal demons, a dysfunctional home life and an unsuccessful attempt at living as a private detective. When his newest client, Cory (Halle Berry), is murdered, her boyfriend (Damon Wayans) joins Hallenback to find out why she was killed. What follows is typically Tony Scott  accentuated action, male bonding and loads of violent, gruesome deaths followed by outbursts of comic one-liners.Written by Shane Black (Lethal Weapon) and directed by Scott (Top Gun), Last Boy Scout works thanks to Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans. The script is stupid, borderline ludicrous  quickly stretching beyond believability, ending in an explosive (somewhat literally) climax that resorts to all the clichés of the genre. However, there is some self-satire to be found within the material. Villains are referred to consistently as ""the bad guys."" Loads of genre clichés are fooled with, spun into jokes  the car chases and action sequences become satirical in nature, whilst the personal life of Hallenbeck  something that might normally be sugar-coated in another genre film  is totally f***ed up, leaving us with a pre-teen daughter who uses profanity like it's going out of style, a cheating wife, and a weary father who stopped giving a crap about it all a long time ago.It's the stuff like this that makes Last Boy Scout succeed past its own sources. Shane Black is excellent at writing this type of stuff, and it really shows. Willis is given the best one-liners of his entire career, making Die Hard's crackling dialog look like child's play. Willis in particular is so good, and so at ease with his character, that his cynical and edgy performance makes the film worth seeing  and heck, even worth owning. It's the ultimate Stupid Male Action Film with Great One-Liners and Loads of Action, a genre I'd like to hereby declare official.",The Last Boy Scout
20,KineticSeoul,Might not be a classic cop movie but it's still a fun ride,7,15 January 2017,"This is another fun cop movie starring Bruce Willis. Again he plays a cool, charismatic, smart mouth cop that shoots first and asks questions later. It shows his arrogance as an actor slightly in this. But the character Joseph ""Joe"" Cornelius Hallenbeck (Bruce Willis) is somewhat of a boy scout type cop. Because despite his way of bending the law to get the job done, his heart is usually in the right place. He seems to be trying to hard to appear cool in this but they make a reference to it in this. This is a fun action cop movie that doesn't take the turn for the overly dark and serious tone. Instead it has the right amount of humor that compliments the violent action and explosions. Halle Berry also makes her early appearance in this as a seductive dancer. But the shocker is how Danielle Harris who plays Joe's bratty loudmouth daughter with some charm would grow up to be pretty and sexy as an adult. It shows that average looking kids can grow up to be handsome or pretty. While sometimes cute kids can grow up to lose their looks. Overall, it might not be a classic cop movie but it's still a fun ride.7/10",The Last Boy Scout
21,Robert_duder,The last of the great eighties action flicks...and the quintessential Bruce Willis hero,8,13 September 2008,"This is the perfect film to demonstrate why Bruce Willis is still an action star to this day. In my opinion his machismo is second only to Clint Eastwood himself. Willis is kick-butt and always has been but he always proved it in gritty, witty, exploding, wicked action flicks and The Last Boy Scout gives us his perfect action hero which is kind of an amalgamation of all his other heroes. On top of that director Tony Scott knows how to tell a good story amidst gun fire, and explosions, possibly better than anyone else although I feel he has stumbled a few times with the likes of the deplorable Domino. But that was later in his career, this was when he was flying high and it shows. The movie has plenty of everything you'd want from the perfect action flick, Bruce Willis, wise cracking side kick, explosions, gun fights, kidnappings, undercover work, a good solid mystery, car chases and so on. The movie is gritty and slick and fun to watch. It's almost too dark to really do itself justice but it is still a wicked good time. Scott takes what could be a run of the mill action flick and gives it edge, gives it purpose and makes the most of a solid cast too.As I said before Bruce Willis is the best of all versions of himself...or rather his heroes. His wise cracking, cigarette smoking John McLean of Die Hard, but then he's also estranged from his family, especially his daughter whom he loves dearly but hides it, he's a washed up alcoholic private detective who was once a secret service agent that saved the President until an over zealous bad Politician ruins him. How great a character is that for an action flick? Willis is perfect to look rough and tired and constantly ticked off and still give the perfect one liners and no matter how mean and cranky he is you root for him every minute. Damon Wayans is really the perfect balance in the film to Willis' character. Wayan's is the wisecracking side kick who ends up working with Willis much to his dismay but become the best of friends...again the perfect action flick mix. Wayan's character reminds me very much of a more athletic and crack addicted version of Eddie Murphy's Axel Foley...coincidence? Tony Scott directed Beverly Hills Cop 2 four years earlier. Wayans and Willis make an unusual team and yet they are terrific together. Halle Berry makes a small appearance in a role as Wayan's girlfriend and a major point in the entire mystery. Her role is graciously small (I'm not a huge fan.) Chelsea Field and Danielle Harris are Willis' wife and daughter. Field's is decent but doesn't get a lot of screen time but Danielle Harris is really something as his feisty, foul mouthed daughter. She's perfect for the part.The Last Boy Scout has a very interesting plot and a really in depth mystery that unfolds very well as each piece of the puzzle falls into place but for an action movie I felt like it was missing a key element. The villain. Yes there are bad guys and there is a main mob boss who they are trying to take down ultimately but he's not at the forefront of the story really. He's not as much of an adversary as an annoyance that they try to take down. I would just like to have seen more connection between Willis, Wayan's, and the boss (played decently by Noble Willingham.) As with any action film you have to suspend a certain amount of belief but the last scene of The Last Boy Scout has always really annoyed me. It's not cool as much at is just a shade too much to swallow. It involves a football being thrown to block a bullet. Nonetheless you won't stop being entertained with the intelligent story and terrific performances by the buddies Willis and Wayans who work great together. I think if they wanted to they could have serialized this but it didn't do well enough apparently. I think it happens to be one of the more intelligent action flicks with plenty of everything you love and a good story to boot. Definitely check it out!! 8.5/10",The Last Boy Scout
22,ElMaruecan82,"Action on the story, humor on the lines and hair on Bruce Willis' head ...",7,6 January 2012,"Tony Scott's ""The Last Boy Scout"" is not a violent film but a film so blatantly aware of its own violence that it deliberately raises it to a dimension where suspension of disbelief is the only key for true enjoyment. Indeed, from the first death that occurs very early in the film, violence, both verbal and visual, starts a never-ending escalate of shock and gruesomeness and what saves the film from being another violent action flick is the combination of a fast-paced editing and a script so rich in priceless lines it manages to redeem it.In this bloody suburban hell, we never have time to question the violence or understand the plot, and whether both matter is clearly something that didn't torture Tony Scott, he had a movie full of action and clever lines, what else could be more important? And oddly enough in the case of ""The Last Boy Scout"", instead of undermining the quality of the film, it provided it something new and amusingly entertaining. With its share of one-dimensional villains, innocent victims present at the wrong time and the wrong moment and wise guys about to get their comeuppances, the film is so exaggerated it rises above any rational attempt to get the story, the film clearly knows its limitations and manages to stick its head above the other classic action films, starring Arnold Schwarzenegger, Sylvester Stallone of Steven Seagal.I guess this enjoyment would have been absent if it wasn't for the lead character, Bruce Willis who plays here a detective named Joe Hallenbeck. ""The Last Boy Scout"" celebrates the return of Willis after the infamous ""Hudson Hawk"" and here it's not just the actor but the whole persona that cemented his legend that is back. Hallenbeck is almost a remake of John McClane with a more downbeat tone. And leveraged by Willis' wisecracking talent ""The Last Boy Scout"" entertains both on the action and writing department, it might be all style but not all substance, and this is what differentiates the movie from any Steven Seagal flick, and when it comes to the action-movie genre, fun is almost a matter of life and death.The humor is omnipresent in ""The Last Boy Scout"", driven by the Bruce Willis-Damon Wayans duo, a dynamic that works because it's perfectly orchestrated by the two actors who play it with the right level of detachment and seriousness; this is a buddy movie but not a remake of ""Lethal Weapon"". Willis' character might have the fighting skills of Riggs, but what strikes first when we meet him is his loserness, and ironically, this is how he inspires sympathy. His daughter is definitely not your average TV sitcom teenage girl, his wife cheats on him, he gets involved in a plot that involves some big shots in the football business, and last but not least, he doesn't lack wit and some of his lines are a delight regardless of your appreciation of the 'story'. It even saves his ass in many occasions, if it ever needed a proof of the power of laughs.This is why Steven Seagal could never be as popular as Bruce Willis, he was playing roles already outdated by the groundbreaking John McClane, the bad-ass hero in an average Joe skin, here Willis is even named Joe as if the writers didn't even want to embarrass themselves by finding a menacing and cool-sounding name and who could take a man named Hallenbeck seriously? Seagal was so invincible I've always wished sometimes the villains could have a break, with Willis, we all know he'll be the hardest nut to crack, but it's all in the 'how he'll get himself off a situation', the revenge of the loser... when Willis had hair and it gave him an ordinary looking charm -now that he looks more menacing as a bald guy- and honorable mention to the effeminate guy who plays the main antagonist, he's the perfect match for Willis in this film.And the movie never disappoints if we have the right mindset to enjoy it. I can't tell you what it is exactly but if you're among those who despise any kind of violence regardless of the way it is induced in the plot, the movie is definitely not for you. I remembered the first time I watched it as a teenager; I had a big problem with the deaths of innocent people in movies. The Windsor crash in ""Die Hard 2"" haunted me during the rest of the film, and ""Terminator 2"" was quite unsettling for me, I hated it when an innocent bystander was suddenly shot or when someone who didn't have a clue about what's going on becomes a collateral damage while the story moves forward without 'mourning' the previous deaths. Needless to say that ""The Last Boy Scout"" had quite an impact on me.I don't deny my pacifist nature and in this world of cynicism, I guess movies like ""The Last Boy Scout"" are often enjoyed for the wrong reasons, because it sets bad examples through characters who're everything but average, and in real-life, if an average Joe wanted to play it like Hallenbeck, he would end up as a dead Joe. But again this is the wrong mindset to appreciate the film, and as soon as you start to find the whole bit funny and stop taking it seriously, the movie develops a sort of re-watchable quality, which already is an achievement.Appreciating ""The Last Boy Scout"" is a very difficult exercise that can unconsciously lead to desensitization in the perception of deaths but seriously, the line between comedy and fun action is so uncertain that you might give it the benefit of doubt, if only for the sake of enjoying a good old 90's gem starring a young Bruce Willis... if only for that climactic gig scene, one of Willis's greatest moments.",The Last Boy Scout
23,Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Chunky shootouts, cheesy one-liners and toxic masculinity.",5,1 October 2018,"Nobody got on with one another on the set of 'The Last Boy Scout (1991)' - not Willis and Wayans, nor Scott and Silva, and certainly not any combination of the four. The result is a bit of a mess, a Stuart Baird re-edit that attempts to sate the ego of all those aforementioned men while cobbling all the disparate elements into something that the studio could still sell, one in which all the bitter behind-the-scenes issues seem to seep straight onto the screen. It has a weak, occasionally disconnected narrative and abrasive characters that are difficult to connect with on any real level, as well as the cursing kid and loosely Christmassy elements that mark it as running on a (fairly heavily altered) Shane Black script (though how this one sold for a, at the time, record-breaking $3,000,000 is beyond me). The end result is a bit of a mishmash of chunky shootouts, cheesy (and sometimes artificially self-referential) one-liners and straight-up toxic masculinity - not to mention some pretty disturbing sexism - that isn't really all that entertaining to watch. 5/10",The Last Boy Scout
24,bowmanblue,They don't make action films like this any more,7,12 July 2015,"I remember when 'The Last Boy Scout' was released. If my memory serves me correctly, it was considered a box off flop. However, I enjoyed it and, now I come to watch it again over twenty years later, I find that today's online reaction seems to back up my feelings towards it. In other words, it's actually quite fun.Bruce Willis plays... well, Bruce Willis really. This could almost be another Die Hard movie by another name. He's a wise-cracking alcoholic cop (or ex cop here, to be fair) who ends up taking on the bad guys. This time he's investigating the double murder of both his best friend and the client he was meant to protect, but whereas he tended to do things on his own in Die Hard, he's ably assisted by a disgraced football player, played by Damon Waynes.The first thing you have to know before you consider watching this is that it's kind of tongue in cheek. Today's action movies seem to be super serious (with the possible exception of the 'Expendables' series), so if you're looking for something tough and gritty, you'll probably find this one a little too far-fetched.It certainly has its plus points. Obviously, there are plenty of shoot outs and car chases, not to mention villains who are uber-villainous and strip clubs to arrange seedy underworld meetings in. But the film's major selling point is the chemistry between Willis and Waynes. They really do play off each other well and the dialogue between them is the very definition of banter.It is a little far fetched though. I will always remember a character being thrown off a bridge, landing on a car, only to get up and wander off like nothing had happened. I think that probably goes down as one of the most 'hardest to survive' falls in film history! Don't expect too much realism here; like I say – tongue in cheek! Having looked up some details online recently, I see that the production was apparently 'fraught with problems' behind the scenes. There are plenty of rumours surrounding what happened on set and I don't know how many are true. However, I still think that the finished product is actually something pretty good fun and very watchable (if you're looking for a pretty implausible buddy type cop film).And, if you're into internet rumours – look up the one about the squirrel, Bruce Willis' trailer and the hair-piece.",The Last Boy Scout
25,CuriosityKilledShawn,Should have been a franchise,7,4 June 2001,"Back in 1991 there was still only one way that studios could sell Bruce Willis and that was as various incarnations of his Die Hard hero. Even Eddie (Hudson) Hawkins had similarities to John McClane. Joe Hallenback is a sort of mix between McClane and Snake Plissken. Watching him mumble and grunt thru various near-deaths and close shaves makes for much fun.Hallenback is a P.I. and scrounges for work wherever he can find it. So he takes up a job protecting a stripper named Cory and soon finds himself in a lot of trouble. Bad guys are trying to get him left right and centre and his bratty 13-year-old daughter tagging along doesn't help much. The bad guys are truly evil and Hallenback seems more like an anti-hero. This adds to the rough nature of the movie and heightens the sense of adventure.Tony Scott's style of direction is best suited to this type of action flick. The flashy, exotic editing and cinematographic techniques lend a lot to the witty script and compliment the seedy or pretty locations. Shane Black has also written dozens of one-liners and riddled the script with funny dialogue and exciting situations. It's no surprise that this was once the most expensive script ever sold in Hollywood. Some people say that this film is too violent and misogynist but I honestly cannot understand what they are talking about. I guess it was just a little out of the norm back in 1991. But still the tone of the film is so light and enjoyable you begin to wonder how this never made up for it. Check it out for yourself and I am sure that you will enjoy.Love that opening song, man. 7/10",The Last Boy Scout

27,slightlymad22,Almost Perfect Entertainment,8,11 December 2014,"I'll admit from the start of this review that I love this movie. It's almost perfect entertainment. However it was not the success it should have been.Directed by Tony Scott, produced by Joel Silver, with a brilliant script written by Shane Black purchased for a record fee, and Bruce Willis at his wisecracking best it all seemed to be in place for a box office smash and a potential franchise. Then during a troubled production too many cooks spoilt the broth. Plot In A Paragraph: Joe Hallenbeck (Bruce Willis) is a burned-out private detective. Jimmy Dix (Damon Wyans) is an ex-LA Stallions player. Hallenbeck is hired to protect Dix's girlfriend Cory (a gorgeous young Halle Berry). When Cory is executed during a drive-by shooting, Hallenbeck and Dix team up to take on the bad guys and save the day.Bruce Willis is at his wisecracking best as Joe Hallenbeck (basically a hungover version of John McClaine from Die Hard) Damon Wyans tries hard to keep up with Willis and generally succeeds. Halle Berry looks great in her small amount of screen time, Noble Willingham is at his best as Shelly Marcone, while Chelcie Ross is perfectly sleazy as Senator Bainett. Taylor Negron is brilliant as Milo and Danielle Harris is good as Darrian, Willis's foul mouthed daughter. I'll forever be amazed this never generated at least one sequel.",The Last Boy Scout

29,tomgillespie2002,They just don't make 'em like this anymore,7,27 January 2018,"Tony Scott's The Last Boy Scout arrived at a time when the macho action thrillers popularised in the 1980's were starting to die out. This, combined with its odd Christmas-time release, meant that the film would go on to underwhelm at the box-office, although it would prove a hit in the rental market and reignite Bruce Willis' action career after the failure of Hudson Hawk. It also took a beating from critics, many voicing their displeasure at the foul-mouthed dialogue and particularly brutal violence. It's a shame really, as looking back, The Last Boy Scout really represents the pinnacle of this overly masculine sub-genre, even though it arrived at a time when audiences were growing tired with it. Yes, it's preposterous, crude and slightly misogynistic, but it's also funny, clever and features screenwriter Shane Black at his most quotable best.The movie begins with making a mockery of American Football's televised musical intros, before diving right into the thick of the action on a particularly dark and rainy night. Running back Billy Cole (Tae Bo guru Billy Blanks) is having a great night on the field before outside pressures and a hit of PCP lead him to shoot up half of the opposition before turning the gun on himself. Deadbeat private investigator Joe Hallenback (Bruce Willis) is acting as a bodyguard for young stripper Cory (Halle Berry), whilst dealing with his own marital problems in a cheating wife and brat daughter. When Cory is killed, her boyfriend - disgraced former quarterback Jimmy Dix (Damon Wayans) - finds himself reluctantly buddying up with Joe to slowly unravel a conspiracy that may expose corruption on a massive scale, and offer an explanation for Billy Cole's mysterious suicide. Their snooping isn't appreciated however, and they soon find themselves the target of a criminal gang desperate to cover their tracks and see their plan through to the end.The Last Boy Scout was famously dogged by production problems, where producer Joel Silver was often cited as the cause of it all. Silver and Willis allegedly took over production, forcing Scott to film scenes he didn't approve of and altering Black's script so much that the finally story barely resembled his original idea. Scott would take revenge in his next film True Romance, where the role of a controlling, cocaine-fuelled producer was modelled on Silver. On top of everything else, Willis and Wayans hated each other. Impressively, these troubles somehow can't be seen in the final product. The chemistry between the two leads is one of the movie's strongest suits, and the plot unravels coherently with more car chases and shoot-outs than you could ever hope for. Scott shoots the film with a glossy commercial aesthetic that works well in the context of the tacky world the film is looking to expose. But the real winner here was Black, who pocketed a cool $1.75 million for his efforts after suffering a setback in his personal life. Despite the changes, this still has the writer's fingerprints all over it, even eclipsing what is undoubtedly his most popular work, Lethal Weapon. They just don't make 'em like this anymore.",The Last Boy Scout
30,tarbosh22000,"The Last Boy Scout, a movie that has proven itself over time to have reached classic status.",10,14 August 2018,"Joe Hallenbeck (Willis) is a jaded private detective just trying to keep his family life together when he takes on the case of Cory (Berry), a stripper involved in a blackmail plot. When Cory's boyfriend Jimmy Dix (Wayans), a former pro-footballer for the L.A. Stallions gets involved, the two unlikely partners become embroiled in a conspiracy that goes...you guessed it, all the way to the top. Along the way, they have to avoid many perilous situations, trouble from goons, and perhaps a surprise appearance from Dick Butkus. Will Joe Hallenbeck truly be THE LAST BOY SCOUT?
Shane Black for President, man. Shane Black for freakin' President. That pretty much sums up our feelings for this great film, and if you haven't seen it in a while, we say it's time to revisit it. We guarantee you won't be disappointed. The great Mr. Black was the writer behind Lethal Weapon (1987), and here he develops that style even more - it's cool, it's funny, it's tough, it has action, it's totally entertaining, everything works, and everything ties up beautifully. As a writer of intelligent, masculine movies, Black is the heir apparent to John Milius. We're happy to give the movie this sort of enthusiastic praise. 
It all opens with a slam-bang opening featuring fan favorite Billy Blanks, and never lets up from there. Even the accompanying video/song ""Friday Night's a Great Time for Football"" by Bill Medley sets the tone well. Bruce Willis is at his absolute best as the burned-out, grizzled private detective - smoking heavily, spitting out un-PC dialogue, and engaging in the sort of witty repartee you just don't see in movies anymore. Damon Wayans, also at his best, is ""action Wayans"", and we should have seen more of that later in his career. Despite their supposed character flaws, both men remain likable, and the viewer is highly invested in their fate. 
While the movie was allegedly beset by production problems and changes, it remains extremely coherent and you'd never know that if you didn't read about it somewhere. If it's this good as it is now, one has to wonder would it be as good if there was no studio meddling - or maybe better? We'll never know, but let's appreciate what we have. It's also packed with many familiar names in the supporting cast, and although a lot of action movies feature a daughter, Danielle Harris as Hallenbeck's daughter Darian has to go on record as the one with the most edge. She has a lot more attitude than the normal tot (she's 13 in the movie but we tend to call them tots). There's even a WYC (White Yelling Chief) to top off the overstuffed package of punching, shooting, chasing, blow-ups, plot developments, and clever dialogue. 
Sadly, they don't make movies like this anymore, but at least we have gems like this. What Shane Black has done is essentially fashion a Philip Marlowe or Sam Spade tale, but updated for 1991. The results are stellar, and we strongly recommend The Last Boy Scout, a movie that has proven itself over time to have reached classic status.",The Last Boy Scout

I've never been a fan of Negron's stand up comedy but he was a pretty good actor and he plays a great villain in this movie. Sure, you can nit-pick at a movie like ""The Last Boy Scout"" but why would you want to? It's a loud, fast moving movie with quite a bit of emotion thrown into the mix.

34,videorama-759-859391,Scout out this action flick of high score,8,19 June 2014,"From the familiar team behind the Lethal Weapons, and Action Jackson, comes another action extravaganza, that delivers heavily on violence, ala: young and gifted screen writing great, Shane Black, and what a super electrically charge action piece he delivers. Everything's here, the exciting and original story, and the performances. Willis plays it straight down the line as Joe Hallenbeck, a cynical ex secret service agent, turned, down and out, car sleeping PI, who's not really into his wardrobe. He couldn't of played the role more perfect. He takes a surveillance job, thrown at him, by his best friend, who was car bombed, but was also doing his sexy wife (Chelsea Field-yeah what happened to her?). Hired to keep tabs on a black woman dancer (Halle Berry) who's blackmailed some rotten apples, involved in the pro American football league, she's taken down, where her ex pro footballing boyfriend (Wayans) teams up with Willis. It's a partnership made in first hell at first, but one you'll remember at the end of the movie and glad it was formed. TLBS is more than an action film, with some back story to it's characters, and some unwarranted but lighter scenes, involving Willis's young teen daughter, and boy, she's got a mouth on her. There's a lot of violence in the film, and I mean a lot of violence, though it's content is not as gruesome as in films like Henry, Portrait Of A Serial Killer, whatever. Action also runs high in this super exciting action adventure flick, where the baddies, besides being wonderfully played, are really bad, and corrupt. You'll love the showdown between Milo (Taylor Negron) and Joe, before Milo goes flying into a set of helicopter blades which douse the copter's windshield in bright red. The tongue and cheek dialogue is the best I've ever heard. The original script is much longer, which even had a snuff scene, and was reportedly worth a few million to it's writer Black, who was only twenty three, when he wrote the first Lethal Weapon. What's weird is over the end credits a Pat Boone song fittingly plays, where the opening score was dynamic, that preceded the super excitingly charged action flick of 92.

Willis (Die Hard) plays Joe Hallenback, an ex-secret service agent turned private detective who has a wife, Sarah (Field) and daughter, Darian (Harris). He's asked by his friend, Mike (McGill) to help protect a stripper, Cory (Berry). Joe learns Sarah is having an affair with Mike who's killed shortly after in a car explosion. Joe talks with Cory and after she's killed, he helps her ex-football player boyfriend, Jimmy Dix (Wayans) search for the man responsible. It turns out to be corrupt, L.A. Stallions owner, Sheldon Marcone (Willingham) who's also Cory's ex plotting to kill a Senator. Negron (Nothing But Trouble) plays Marcone's right hand man, Milo who insists on calling people by their full names like, ""Joseph."" I love this film and Bruce & Damon are great together. This is definitely one of the best action films I recommend.",The Last Boy Scout
36,jtindahouse,Brilliant one-liners and Bruce's best!!!,9,19 November 2005,"Bruce Willis is absolutely outstanding in this classic action-comedy with all the perfectly delivered one-liners and ultra-coolness with which his modern day roles seem to lack. He is paired up with Marlon Wayans who could've shown up a lot of Hollywood actors in this movie but not Bruce Willis - he was out classed. By the end of the film most people have forgotten that Halle Berry was even in it and this is possibly because her performance was mediocre at best I felt (it will be forgiven though since she didn't really have a lot of time to introduce her character). What really made this movie special for me though was the one-liners, my personal favorite being ""This is the 90's you can't just go around shooting people, you have to say something cool first,"" if there is ever a better one than this I look incredibly forward to hearing it and prey that it's delivered with at least half the perfection that Bruce placed his in the history books with. There was a completely unrealistic car-chase at one stage, but hey, what action movie hasn't had that.",The Last Boy Scout
37,barnabyrudge,"A violent, energetic, empty exercise in spectacular action and comedy.",5,12 July 2007,"If Robert Bolt and Michael Wilson had demanded a seven-figure sum for their Lawrence Of Arabia script, people might have resented their greed but be forced, grudgingly, to admit that the script they had written was a work of outstanding quality. It seems astonishing that Shane Black's script for The Last Boy Scout resulted in a well-publicised bidding war, and was ultimately snapped up for a reported $1.75 million! This story is so gung-ho, so simple-minded, such typical blood-and-thunder action fodder, that it could have been written by any adventurous-minded teenager! It is basically a series of set pieces held together by the thinnest thread of a plot. Car chases, shootings, stabbings, fist-fights, explosions, outrageous stunts, wisecracks.... you name it, and it's here. As mindless action movies go, this one is a contender for the most mindless of them all. Also, in its totally undemanding way, it is rather entertaining.A honest Secret Service agent, Joe Hallenbeck (Bruce Willis), is forced out of his job because he refuses to turn a blind eye to inter-departmental corruption. He finds himself doing the rounds as a scruffy private investigator, eking out an existence by tackling seedy cases that no-one else will touch. An ex-pro footballer, Jimmy Dix (Damon Wayans), hires Hallenbeck to protect his stripper girlfriend Cory (Halle Berry). Seems Dix was kicked out of the sport for gambling, but has links with a high-reaching gambling racket which puts him and his girlfriend at considerable risk. Hallenbeck fails to protect Cory, and she is gunned down by a team of hired killers. The (angry) private eye and the (angrier) footballer join forces to nail the bad guys. Their mission brings them up against a huge illegal gambling syndicate, but their predicament becomes even worse when Hallenbeck's teenaged daughter, Darian (Danielle Harris), inadvertently gets caught up in the firing line.The Last Boy Scout is a loud, flashy thriller which concentrates on high-tech action at the exclusion of just about everything else. Tony Scott directs with typical gusto - the whizzing camera, energetic editing, thunderous soundtrack and non-stop violence are real trademarks of his work. Ten minutes of this kind of thing can be quite intoxicating, but as the film pushes towards the two-hour mark it loses its ability to thrill through sheer unrelenting repetition. I don't know if records are kept for the most cars smashed, the most panes of glass shattered or the most expletives used within a single film, but if such records exist then, for much of its running time, The Last Boy Scout seems hell-bent on rewriting every last one of them. To say this is a bad film simply isn't true - it is very entertaining on its own mindless level, a real roller-coaster ride of adrenalin-pumping action and violence. But to call it a good film is equally inaccurate - the simplistic nature of the characters and plot puts shackles on any wider aspirations the film might hold. To summarise: fast, trashy, noisy, violent, entertaining.... and quite empty!",The Last Boy Scout

PROBABLY WILLIS BEST FILM,9,6 November 2018,"Oh my I've watched this classic 90's action Thriller hundreds of times especially when i was a kid, a young action junkie lol i used to stay up late watching tons of action movies by all the old school greats such as Schwarzenegger,van damme,Stallone,
Willis & segal.
My fave action star will always be the king of Action Schwarzenegger but i watched lots of these guys shoot up the place & they was good fun memories anyway Willis was always the best he's ever been as Joe Hallenbeck the wisecracking private detective in the exciting non-stop brutal action packed The Last Boy Scout!!!
My fave willis movie & yes i like this better than his Die Hard films but i love those too,anyway also Damon Wayans makes a perfect comedy wisecracking team with bruce as Jimmy Dix a pro-football player who has messed up his career & finds himself mixed up with Joe Hallenbeck & it gets messy with mystery & bloody action & full of suspense & fun.
Bruce Willis was excellent through the 90's with some excellent Action Thrillers such This-The last boy scout (1991),Striking Distance (1993) Die Hard 2 (1990),Die Hard with a Vengeance (1995) & Last Man Standing (1996) & others but those i like best of his 90s Action Thriller movies.
Boy Scout is excellent directed by Tony Scott & has a great music score & that matters lots as these old school movies are always remembered by their fans for the Nostalgia factor & that comes from the music we come to know & love with our movies so that's always very important.
The last boy scout is pure adult action packed fun & great late night entertainment like how i enjoyed it awww Nostalgia!!! 10/10 easily",The Last Boy Scout
39,Catherine_Grace_Zeh,"Very suspenseful, funny, and action-packed thrill ride",10,17 November 2005,"In my opinion, THE LAST BOY SCOUT is a very suspenseful, funny, and action-packed thrill ride. I thought that Joe (Bruce Willis) and Jimmy (Damon Wayans) made a really good detective team, especially when they were searching for the murderer of Jimmy's girlfriend, Cory (Halle Berry). A couple of things I liked about this film were the theme song that played at the beginning of the movie right before the first football game started and whenever Joe and Jimmy kicked the bad guys a****. Those parts really made me feel good and smile. In conclusion, I highly recommend this suspenseful action-packed thrill ride to all you Bruce Willis or Damon Wayans who have not seen it. When you see it, buckle up and hold on tight for a ride of pure thrills and laughs.",The Last Boy Scout
40,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Shane Black and Tony Scott pull the action and fun ripcord,9,3 April 2016,"Tony Scott's The Last Boy Scout is pure stylistic grime, an exercise in early 90's action with the blackest of humour. The tone is set with a square jaw early on: a star quarterback for a hotshot NFL team is under a lot of underground pressure to make that perfect play and in turn please the loan sharks. He buckles under the heat, ends up pulling a gun on the field and murdering a score of opponents before turning the gun on himself. Now horrifying as that is, if you have a sick sense of humor like me it conjures a dark chuckle of the most guilty variety, because.. well, it's funny! Albeit in the darkest way possible, which is the arena this one skates in, love it or leave it. Upon closer examination of the script we discover it's penned by that wonderful man Shane Black, who gave us Kiss Kiss Bang Bang and the upcoming The Nice Guys. No one can produce such heinous mayhem with a cavalier attitude and actually get away with it as well as Black does. The guy is a prodigy of dark humour, and who better to embody his protagonist here than a sheepish Bruce Willis as Joe Hallenbeck, a jaded ex detective who is so sullen and cynical he's almost comatose. He's paired with equally slummy former quarterback Jimmy Six (Damon Wayons), lazily trying to solve a case involving the murderous quarterback and some shady politicians. Along the way that's paved with many a sarcastic, beleaguered exchange they cross seedy paths with shady villains (Taylor Negron, RIP, and a youthful Kim Coates), a beautiful working girl with ties to the case (Halle Berry) and Willis's spitfire of a dysfunctional daughter (Danielle Harris). There's a wonderfully bloated supporting cast including Noble Willingham, Chelsea Field, Joe Santos, Bruce McGill and more. It's got a bite that stings, mainly thanks to Black's frighteningly pissy screenplay which give the film it's sardonic, put - upon aesthetic. This meshes together nicely with Scott's trademark sun soaked, pulpy, picturesque tone and provides one hell of an action movie ride. Nasty in all the right places, funny when the story begs for it, and build to last.",The Last Boy Scout

Willis is good in this as a self loathing, alcoholic private investigator with a five o'clock shadow and a cynical and sarcastic demeanor. After some baddies smoke Halle Berry, he teams up with her boyfriend, gambling addicted ex football flunky Damon Wayans. The Last Boy Scout is a good buddy movie with some snappy dialouge and whole lot of gun play that leads to a nefarious NFL team leader( Noble Willingham, who is best known for playing CD Parker with The Norris in Walker Texas Ranger, one of the greatest shows ever on television) that is behind a lot of political corruption with sports betting and bribery.

45,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of The Last Boy Scout,7,12 May 2014,"After the enormous success of 1988's Die Hard, Bruce Willis continued to flaunt his tough guy, anti-hero persona in The Last Boy Scout. As Mr. five-o-clock shadow Joe Hallenbeck, he teams up with comedian Damon Wayans (James Alexander Dix) to solve the murder of Dix's girlfriend all the while taking down a crooked football team owner. Wayans plays a has- been quarterback and Willis plays a once fallen secret service agent.With Brucie all guns blazing and at his macho best, this is one gritty, down and dirty action flick that almost defines him more than all the Die Hards combined. There's plenty of great one liners (eat your heart out Schwarzenegger) and stuff blowing up so just sit back, grab some popcorn, and hold on. Oh, and watch for the final, violent showdown at the L.A. Coliseum between Hallenbeck and villain Milo (played by Taylor Negron who actually announces himself as the bad guy). It gives new meaning to the term, ""if I get out of this I swear I'm gonna dance a jig."" You'll know what I mean if you check your brain at the door and let the chaos spill onto the screen.

There's no other way to explalin the 7.0 rating (as of this writing).This regurgitated mess, where Willis proves he's no Mel Gibson, while Daman Wayans proves he's not a very good bl3ck sidekick, is a simple-minded, profanity-filled, badly acted, stupidly plotted mess that deserves about a 3.0 rating. But when you've got units to move, you get all your Uigher slaves to sign up for I Am Dee Bee accounts to register 10-star ratings.

47,eric262003,Excellent Film But No Extras In The Blu-Ray,9,10 September 2017,"When I first saw ""The Last Boy Scout"", it was during the school exam period (luckily it was a Friday night) and I had a chance to see it with a few of my friends. Being that I was a huge Bruce Willis fan thanks mainly to the Die Hard series and his knack for playing roles as a flawed hero lured into dangerous situations and always coming out on top. Being that it was produced by Joel Silver and written by ""Lethal Weapon"" alum Shane Black, the temptation was just way too hard to resist. It was great to see old Bruce go up against corrupt football gangsters while preparing for my mid-terms at the same time.Willis plays former Secret Service agent now private detective Joe Hallenback who has become lowered to drinking, sleeping in cars and making friends with a squirrel is assigned to protect a stripper named Cory (Halle Berry). Unfortunately, tragedy is struck when Cory gets killed by a hit-man and joins forces with her mad boyfriend Jimmy Dix (Damon Wayans), a former football star who's been banned for gambling and drug addictions. Moving forward to a cornucopia of impressive set pieces, the duo fumble their way into a bribery plot in which federal bureaucrats are going through measures to find a way to make sports gambling legal. And just like almost every 1990's action film, cars are being blown up, bad guys are getting killed and the one-liners are as cheeky as they ever were, marked with outstanding execution and clever delivery.It's a shame that this movie never gets the accolades it deserves, but if you get the chance to watch it, you won't be disappointed. Aside from the the excellent performances from the leads by Willis and Wayans, the supporting cast was equally impressive as well especially from Bruce McGill, Noble Willingham and Taylor Negron. Shane Black's script may at times feel like a brain-stormed idea for a ""Lethal Weapon"" movie, it still succeeds to bring a smile on the faces to those who like fast paced action scenes and sardonic humour to go along with the scenes. The dialogue is quite spot-on as it's smart and even through multiple viewings it never once gets stale. This may not be late director Tony Scott's best work, which is not a well argument due to all the exciting stuff you see here. Sure the original screenplay was doctored a bit, but it's still far from being a complete dud. The escapism couldn't be any better with high adrenaline inducing action along with scintillating characters and a story that pulls no punches, this is another fine line of classic action films that the 1990's was famous for.If I have any gripes, it would have to the Blu-ray features because it doesn't contain any kind of extras. And sure it might be a bit too pricey to have a full-fledged documentary of film regarded by the critics as a dud, it would've been a treat to see interviews from performers and crew in making ""The Last Boy Scout"". Other than that it's a very well-crafted film with a lack of any behind the scenes coverage. Kind of sad when you think about it. Makes the forgotten all the more forgettable.",The Last Boy Scout

It is good. Profane and straightforwardly so, for sure, but very good indeed at going about its business.Instinctively I feel that there is everything in here a hardcore action fan could want. Pulsating music, Bruce Willis as the hungover but determined underdog, a smart-mouthed sidekick and plenty of sharply witty one-liners to complement the chaos.

But I love 'The Last Boy Scout', such a wonderful mixture of wit, action and superb characterisation. There are some terrific one liners and a wonderful performance from Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans as a pair of guys who have very much fallen from grace but now have a chance at redemption. Not only are they funny and resourceful ""You touch me again I'll kill you"" but they're believable, constantly getting the stuffing knocked out of them and showing it. People argue it's an overly violent film but frankly most of the violence is directed towards our heroes. Also worthy of praise is Danielle Harris who pretty much steals the show as Willis' acerbic daughter. Refreshingly entertaining villains too, especially Milo as a very atypical thug and 'The Guy who Invented Scrabble'. Some say it's a misogynist film, we have a cheating wife, foul mouthed rebellious daughter and a gorgeous young Halle Berry stripper who gets brutally machine-gunned to death. But you can only sympathise with Chelsea Field's unfaithful wife, living with Joe Hollenback would drive anyone crazy, she actually comes across as an intelligent and independent woman whilst Harris actually saves the day. The footballer who holds a groupie underwater in order to make her give him oral sex gets his nose broken as does the Senator who likes to beat on women.One quibble, at the end Falcone is killed by opening the briefcase yet they let the police lieutenant do the same?

54,TOMASBBloodhound,Absolutely everything it was intended to be. Testosterone powered mayhem.,10,13 March 2005,"The Last Boy Scout is without a doubt one of the greatest action movies ever made. There is nothing a good action film needs that isn't woven into Tony Scott's vision of Shane Black's screenplay. We have shootouts.... lots and lots of shootouts. We have Bruce Willis. We have football. We have some beautiful women at our disposal. There are some fast cars. There are drugs. And the profanity-laden dialog is so well-written that virtually the entire script can be read in the memorable quotes section of this site.Our story, though completely preposterous, has some real depth. We have multi-dimensional characters and we are taken on quite a ride with them as the action unfolds. Bruce Willis plays a burned out private investigator who helps a disgraced former pro football player solve the murder of his girlfriend. Before our story ends, we have a dirty US senator, a greedy football team owner, and about a hundred seedy henchmen thrown into the mix. Things move so quickly that only towards the end does one of our characters actually speak a line that sums up how ridiculous it all is. Damon Wayans, who plays the former football star gives Willis some sobering insight. He points out that Willis must be one of the dumbest people alive. He is not only trying to save the life of the man who ruined his career, but also trying to avenge the death of the man who was f*#king his wife! But somehow, we the audience care about the outcome, and getting there couldn't be more fun.The film has dated fairly well up to this point. Being as though it came out in 1991, you can still see a high top fade on a black character or two. The football uniforms have changed a little, too, but these are minor things that take nothing away from the enjoyment of the story.

I know I liked this movie a lot when it first came out, but nearly 30 years later its age is showing. It's still slick and very well-produced and one of those movies that is a perfect Bruce Willis vehicle, but it's also definitely a relic of its time. There is no real point to this film--it's a very thin script fleshed out with tons of quips and action sequences; however, on the other hand, due to the overall quality of the production, you don't feel bad about wasting your time on it either. I only finished watching it 30 minutes ago, and I'm already starting to forget what it was about again. By tomorrow morning it will be a distant memory. There really is no there there. In no way whatsoever has anyone ever improved their mind in any way watching ""The Last Boy Scout"", but if you're only looking for some time-killing, fast-moving, 1990s-style, Hollywood popcorn entertainment, this is a decent choice (especially if you're a guy).",The Last Boy Scout

There also was a huge amount of blood spilled on screen. But these two things weren't the only two things very often occurring on the screen. There was also a lot of good chemistry between the actors (especially Willis and Wayans). Willis' kid and wife, played by Danielle Harris and Chelsea Field respectively were great too (why aren't they in more big movies). And the bad guys (Taylor Negron as Milo and Noble Willingham as Shelly Marcone) are great too and Halle Berry (as a stripper, we do NOT see naked (what a pity)) and everyone man, EVERYONE is GREAT, trust me.
This is a movie that had it all, ladies and gentlemen, blood; cursing; bad, but funny jokes; car chases; a cool bad guy; funny lines; action; great music; a great story and great direction by one of my favourite directors Tony Scott (great job here too man) I think all of his movies are good, except Days of Thunder and Top Gun. The actors I like too. Bruce Willis has a lot of good movies and Wayans too has a couple and I think there are great actors within this funny-action type genre.

Past this point the rest of The Last Boy Scout begins to unravel intense and nonstop. All these moments are unforgettable, especially the opening credits scene, but Cory's dance is my most memorable moment, by far, thanks to Halle Berry. When Halle smacks her butt in a thong and cowgirl chaps, then turns to the camera in that blonde wig and cowboy hat, licks her lips, blows the imaginary smoke from her toy pistol, and starts busting it open, I can't imagine anything hotter. I don't have to imagine. She looks INSANE in that blonde wig, and then the stars over her boobs, oh my sweet heavenly goodness. Behave! I'm trying. Halle Berry is the hottest woman in the history of the universe. That is a fact and it is not an opinion. I love Halle. Halle, thank God for you! You are the best.

Both of the movies did a great job! Every time I watch this movie, I just miss the 90's. The 80's and the 90's had such a great action movies. Bruce Willis wasn't over hyped than like he is now, he as a true sold out. In this film he completely Entertains me. The action and the story are so good in here that you just wanna keep watching it. The acting in here is superb and the action scenes are outstanding and fantastic. You have a lot of famous actors in here.

Script is simple, witty one-liners are all over the place and Willis does a great job playing a rundown detective.Tony Scott does a great job directing action movies and it is a shame that he passed away in 2012. I have always enjoyed his movies beside The Last Boy Scout there are Top Gun, Beverly Hills Cop II, Enemy of the State and Man on Fire movies. Tony Scott is very missed by fans including me. So in this movie you have actors like are: Noble Willingham from Walker, Texas Ranger (1993) TV Series, Halle Berry from X-Men, Bruce McGill from MacGyver, Joe Santos from TV Series: The Rockford Files, MacGyver and Magnum P.I., Kim Coates from Prison Break, Chelsea Field from Commando (1985) she was a stewardess on an airplane where John Matrix (Arnold Schwarzenegger) gets on a board on the airplane and Billy Blanks. You have full cast of actors and actresses I have memorized from TV Shows and from movies. 1991's The Last Boy Scout paired Bruce Willis with Damien Wayans in this scripted buddy flick from Shane Black who gave us Lethal Weapon. Boy Scout uses the various themes expected from such a genre film and Willis gives an A-1 performance as a wise-crackin' half-in-the-bag detective out to help Wayan's character of Jimmy Dicks search for his girlfriends killer and also put a stop to a plot to kill a senator and legalize sports gambling all at the same time. Boy Scout was directed by Tony Scott who knows how to tell action stories. This has it all. Solid action with lots of twisted humor tossed in. Honestly I love this. Perfect action for the era with as many cheesy punch lines as you can squeeze in. Second only to Die Hard.Thrilling action beautifully directed by Tony Scott....a to-the-point story that actually has you invested...and a great leading Willis all make for a good movie but what makes this movie GREAT is the duo of Willis and Wayans and the chemistry they share together....I know your thinking that a pairing like that is a DISASTER for an action movie but let me tell you it is the complete opposite...the duo is the main reason the movie flows so well....so I say buy this movie because you surely wont be disappointed.Emmy and Golden Globe-winner Bruce Willis (""Die Hard"", ""Sin City"") and Emmy-nominee Damon Wayans (TV's ""My Wife and Kids,"" TV's ""In Living Color"") team up as an ex-secret service agent and a former pro-football hero who uncover a web of intrigue and corruption in professional sports when they team up to investigate the murder of the football player's stripper girlfriend. That's your basic plot. The movie has action impact and it is action packed from beginning till end. Joe (Bruce Willis) has always great liens he uses in the movie. He is straight and honest guy who his daughter and wife does not respect him. He is an ex washed up secret service agent man turning in to private detective. He has to protect a striper when she is killed he teams up with washed up pro football player. The movie also evolves, scandals, extraction, gambling deb, alcoholism and so on. The film is violent, and bloody, there are a lot of hand guns and machine guns used in this movie and they are used well. This movie is a perfect 10 for me and it is my favorite action movie from Bruce Willis and Tony Scott.

He is more than ably assisted by Newcomer Damon Wayans, as they form a black-and-white-guy partnership which keeps you laughing throughout. Shame that Wayans then squandered his goodwill on the lacklustre Scary Movie and its sequels, but there you go. Other highlights include the most foul-mouthed pre-teen girl in history,a mesmerising shoot-out in the woods and Willis dancing a jig on top of a stadium at night (Don't ask). Die Hard 1 will always be the watermark regarding his action films, but this is a fine addition to a long list that only Stallone and Schwarzeneggar could possibly rival.",The Last Boy Scout
60,petra_ste,We are bein' beat up by the inventor of Scrabble,8,6 August 2007,"This is either the funniest action movie ever or the most violent comedy. The screenplay by Shane Black is priceless - even if I have seen it countless times, The Last Boy Scout always brings a smile to my face. And of course we have the duo Bruce Willis / Damon Wayans, with great chemistry and comedic timing.Private detective Joe Hallenbeck (Willis in his ""sardonic action hero"" mode) has a messy personal life. His colleague Mike (Bruce McGill) asks him to protect Cory (Halle Berry) from mysterious threats. When both Mike and Cory are killed, Hallenbeck and Cory's boyfriend Jimmy (Wayans), ex-quarterback, team up to solve the case.The two leads are perfect, but the supporting cast is also brilliant, with Halle Berry, McGill as Hallenbeck's sleazy pal, Taylor Negron as smug baddie Milo and young Danielle Harris in a vivid turn as Hallenbeck foul-mouthed daughter.A great action comedy, and one of the late Tony Scott's best movies. To quote Joe Hallenbeck, ""You can't just walk up and slap a guy, you have to say something cool first"".8,5/10",The Last Boy Scout
61,BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,Classic,8,21 October 2005,"One of Bruce Willis's many movies where he plays a tough cop... and what is there to say? He is pretty damn good at it and this is very entertaining movie.The story has the lives of a detective and a former quarterback intersect when a night club dancer is murdered. The cop was supposed to protect her and the former football star was her boyfriend and that leads both men to cooperate and investigate what really happened. A conspiracy of sorts in the world of sports is soon uncovered and action ensues.What makes this film stand out is the characters are surprisingly full of life: they have their problems at home, in their jobs, with their friends and Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans give very well acted performances it was basically a buddy action comedy. The film has its serious moments, but they by no means spoil the rest of the movie, but rather add to it and give it a more human feel, because after all, the protagonists are people. Also the countless one-liners (priceless wit from screenwriter Shane Black) make for a very quotable movie and Tony Scott's high octane direction makes it exciting, and when mixed with the good performances and you've got yourself a classic. Watch it. 8/10Rated R: strong violence and profanity",The Last Boy Scout

If you made a movie and it was unintentionally self-parodying would you be OK with that? Yes, a classic 90's action movie, no, that's not so great. Classic 90's action means people do get shot in the head a lot, which is awesome, but with that the dialog/plot/action are all garbage. Silly. Damon Wayans is out of his depth. He can be a talented character actor in a comedic role, but otherwise he cannot act, when tasked with the role of playing supporting actor to Bruce Willis's lead, Damon Wayans is over matched. Bruce Willis has made a career of playing one-liner spouting tough guys, to his credit he can make it believable, whereas Damon comes off at best as merely acting the part. A good movie to get high to, equate that to mean what you will.",The Last Boy Scout
63,TheOtherFool,Bad ass action movie (spoilers),7,1 April 2004,"Joe sees his best friend blown to pieces. Jimmy sees his girlfriend killed. The audience at a big football game see several guys shot.

Aparently, this boss got something to do with bribing some hot shot politician... erm... I think it had to do with gambling... I believe... Anyway, add the fact that this Jimmy person once was a great Football-player, the addition of a corrupt senator and Joe's daughter tagging along for the ride, and you got your over-the-top-explosion-blockbuster story complete. Oh and did I mention Joe once saved the president?As cheesy as this gets (and boy, does it get cheesy), it was actually pretty enjoying. The one-liners (there are many, people) are quite funny and Willis is perfect in this Die Hard kinda role. And boy is he a great dancer! High death-rate and the no. 1 slap-in-the-face movie of all time I think.One last thing: make sure you don't miss the opening credits, as they are the worst I have ever seen, with a sleazy Dustin Hoffman look-a-like singing 'friday night's a great night for football'.Overall: great unpretentious fun, 7/10.",The Last Boy Scout
64,tomimt,Okay action from the early 90's,6,25 March 2006,"The Last Boy Scout is typical action movie of the early 90's: bloody and full of one liners and bad jokes. That really is pretty much all there's to it, even tough we are shown the domestic problems of the detective.So Joe Hallenbeck (Bruce Wills) is ex secret service agent, who even saved the president on his time, who is now days scumbag detective who neglects his family. He's given a job to protect pretty stripper (Halle Berry), who then gets herself dead and Joe and the boyfriend of the girl Jim Dix (Damon Wayans) go figure who dunnit and why.There is lots of macho flexing all around and Joe even is this ultimate hardboiled type of a guy, who seems to be literally immune to pain. For what it's worth the action is okay, a bit outdated on todays standards, but it does work. It's not the best movie of its genre, but its not pure drivel either. With the right state of mind you can get whew laughs out of the jokes and kicks out of the action.",The Last Boy Scout

66,Peach-2,Fancy and care free.,5,28 October 1998,"The Last Boy Scout is a very fancy action movie, but a very empty one as well. The movie stars Bruce Willis, Damon Wayans and Halle Berry. Berry is hardly in the movie so basically this is a movie for Willis and Wayans to throw one liners at each other and be involved in a lot of action at the same time. The movie is a mess, but Tony Scott has so much style that you sometimes get wrapped up in it anyway. I believe the screenwriter, Shane Black, started writing this script and basically it read, ""two morons fight the bad guys"" and that was the plot. When someone like Tony Scott is behind the camera then you know the film will look great. They really didn't need a script for this one just let Scott run free with the concept and see what happens. I enjoyed myself watching this movie, but afterwards I felt like I hadn't seen anything new or fresh. I felt numb from the experience and will probably never watch this picture again.",The Last Boy Scout
67,Beejerman,CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),8,15 January 2019,"The stage curtains open ...In this high octane action thriller, Bruce Willis plays the part of Joe Hallenbeck - a washed up, down on his luck private investigator who was formerly with the Secret Service. A scumbag colleague, Mike (Bruce McGill), gives him a tip on a job protecting a stripper (Halle Berry), which he accepts. Her boyfriend Jimmy (Damon Wayans), a former QB for a professional football team, becomes an unwitting partner for Joe when she is murdered. As they uncover a scheme to legalize sports gambling, Joe finds himself ironically protecting the one man he despises, who had him disgraced and kicked out of the Secret Service.Everyone in this movie has a smart mouth - and I mean everyone, including Joe's young teenage daughter (Danielle Harris). There is a lot of witty banter, smart aleck remarks and attitude to be had. Even when our duo is facing certain death, they are spouting ridiculous lines. For example: ""We're being beat up by the inventor of Scrabble"". After a while, it does get grating listening to everyone trying to act cool and clever.And yet, this movie is still a lot of fun. I liked its premise, the action sequences were fun even though some of the camera work is a little shoddy, and the tone of the movie was darker than most action films of the day. Joe Hallenbeck is a very flawed character, as is everyone in his family ... well, as is everyone in this film actually. But, despites their own grievances, they manage to save the day.This isn't one of Bruce Willis's best movies, but it is one of his most fun movies. I consider this to be a guilty pleasure. I've watched it many times over the years, and it still holds up well. I'll be watching it again too. A recommend for action fans.",The Last Boy Scout
68,policy134,It's a man's world,7,12 April 2009,"It's like watching a train derailing. You think it's horrible but you can't help watching because ...them sparks sure is purty.I don't think there has been a movie where all of the characters are so close at being bottom of the barrel. By that, I mean that there are basically no heroes here, the good guys are only slightly less crooked than the bad, because they think they are.Bruce Willis' Joe Hallenbeck, has long past caring about anything in his life because of a bum deal. He got screwed by a senator and not in the fun way (careful: the movie does everything to not imply the characters are gay). His wife is screwing around (not cheating because this is a too nice a word to use here) with what is supposed to be his best friend and his daughter is a foul-mouthed little brat.What to do when you haven't any reason to face the day. Oh, yes. As luck would have it, Joe gets one chance of getting back at his nemesis, the senator and his minions (there are more of them than you have ever seen in any action movie, except one involving martial arts). In enters Jimmy Dix, played by Damon Wayans as he didn't care to put something into his performance, who screwed himself but blames everybody else. He is a fun guy who likes to take a little powder to ease his pain.Since the plot lines are basically left in the dark, what we got is a steady stream of one liners and people meeting their demise in the most grisly way you can imagine. Sometimes you are not laughed out before you are schocked instantaneously.It would be hard to make this movie today, not simply because of the grisly violence but because of the sexist attitude of the two main characters. Willis' character uses the most derogatory terms about women ever uttered by a protagonist and Damon Wayans' character's girlfriend is nothing more than a nude scene and then a grisly murder. Halle Berry before she was a star.The screenwriter, Shane Black, basically hauled this movie over again when he made Kiss Kiss Bang Bang where the guys where inept and the girl was the protagonist. Tony Scott, the director is known for his style over substance approach to film-making and you get it here in spades.The movie is funny in spots but it is more funny in the sense that you can't believe what you just heard or saw.

70,Cinemaniac1984,A very underrated action comedy that is still enjoyable today,9,30 January 2015,"It's hard to believe that The Last Boy Scout under performed at the box office and was not a blockbuster many had hoped despite the hype surrounding the movie. This had all the elements of a solid action comedy extravaganza. There was no denying the star power of Bruce Willis who cemented his status as an action hero in Die Hard, and Damon Wayans who established himself in numerous comedies. Writer Shane Black exploded onto the Hollywood scene in a big way with Lethal Weapon. Larger than life producer Joel Silver who was responsible for movies such as Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, Commando, Predator and 48 Hrs had the Midas touch when it came to box office blockbusters. And the late director Tony Scott was flying high following the success of Top Gun. Unfortunately most audiences didn't see The Last Boy Scout as box office gold and many critics dismissed the movie as an implausible action movie that was too violent with an overload of coarse language. In spite of its underwhelming performance at the box office, The Last Boy Scout later became widely popular when released on home video.Bruce Willis stars as a former highly regarded Secret Service Agent turned two-bit private investigator Joe Hallenbeck. Joe Hallenbeck is a mess when we first see him in the movie. He is an alcoholic and he appears as an unkempt slob. He was fired from the Secret Service for punching Senator Calvin Baynard (Chelcie Ross) to stop him from torturing a woman in a hotel room and refusing to cover up the incident. Joe's wife Sarah (Chelsea Field) who is growing tired of his indifferent attitude is also having an affair with Joe's best friend and business partner Mike Matthews (Bruce McGill). Joe's abrasive, foul-mouthed daughter Darian (Danielle Harris) does not respect her father and frequently defies him. Mike is killed in a car bomb after he hands Joe a job to act as a bodyguard for a stripper named Cory (Halle Berry in an early role). Cory's boyfriend, former LA Stallions quarterback Jimmy Dix (Damon Wayans) who was banned after allegations of gambling and drug use, confronts Joe and instantly dismisses Joe as a loser. After Cory is gunned down by several hit men, Joe Hallenbeck and Jimmy Dix must work together to uncover a serious corruption scandal involving a Senator and the high profile owner of the LA Stallions Shelly Marcone (Noble Willingham). As well as investigating why Jimmy's girlfriend Cory was murdered, they must also evade Marcone's top henchman, the sadistic Milo (the late Taylor Negron).They don't make movies like The Last Boy Scout anymore. Hardcore ultra-violent old-school action, foul mouthed one liners, and plenty of humorous moments. Nowadays most action movies are either watered down to attract a larger audience or even throw all logic out the window and have action for the sake of action, and sometimes most violent action movies can be box office poison.Besides the Die Hard movies (except the disappointing A Good Day to Die Hard) and The Sixth Sense, this is one of Bruce Willis' best movies. I enjoyed it a lot. Damon Wayans makes a great sidekick for Bruce Willis and his comedic timing is well suited for this movie. The rest of the cast is quite good, in particular the late Taylor Negron as the sadistic Milo made a great villain.The Last Boy Scout is still a guilty pleasure of mine and is still holds up as a very enjoyable action comedy.9/10",The Last Boy Scout
71,lathe-of-heaven,"Entertaining, but I feel that the script and acting (particularly Damon's, surprisingly) really hurt the film...",6,13 April 2013,"I was quite surprised that Tony Scott had directed this movie since I have seen many of his and they are usually real quality films. Perhaps it could be because this one was made so long ago (1991) but I was surprised that I found the film kind of disappointing.Primarily I think the fault lies in the direction; the script is pretty amateurish at times, but I think what comes across, especially in Damon Wayan's case is the delivery, and for a film like this, that fault rests squarely on the director. And, what the HELL was with the painfully HORRENDOUS performance by the girl who plays Bruce Willis's daughter for God's sake!??? GEEZ... BAD lines. Awful delivery; that scene in the car where she first catches up with Damon is truly cringe-inducing at it's worse (Honestly... just check out the painful dialog in that sequence; it pretty much makes my whole point here) A good director like Scott should most certainly have corrected that.So, my question is... what the HELL was Tony Scott doing during all this? Sleeping...? smok'n some bad weed...? Messing with Corey Haim...? (EEK!)Now, I don't mean to say that EVERYTHING is bad with this film because it really isn't. There is indeed much about the movie that is quite good. Bruce's performance GREATLY overshadows everyone else's. The writing for HIM was decent; a lot of his lines were pretty good. Many of the other, OTHER supporting actors were very good characterizations, especially the tycoon guy. He and Willis easily stood light years over the others.The plot was excellent; the tone was somewhat excruciating at times, NOT because it was bad but because what was happening (and what had happened before) was SO damn painful, sad, and morose that it just kills you. That IS a big part of this film and that is unusual for a 'Buddy Cop' type movie of this type to evoke such strong feelings. Usually, things are played much lighter a la the 'LETHAL WEAPON' series, for example. Nothing wrong with that, but to me it just gave the film an odd tone. But, that is why the humour that IS there is an excellent balance for the dire circumstances and experiences that these fellows have had. Then again, the transitions from the VERY heavy talk to the supposed light, 'funny' scenes are done somewhat jarringly which tends to make the humour seem artificial, contrasting badly with the heartfelt and sad things that they were just discussing. And again, that falls squarely under the director's responsibility.Basically for what it's worth, this is my take on it... If you are going to make a Fun Action film, then make it that way (like Guy Ritchie for example) or... If you are going to portray the 'hero' of an action film like was done here with a much heavier and more serious tone, then you have to construct the rest of the film around that type of character better.So, there are a lot of good points about the movie, but unfortunately, in my lowly and wretched opinion, the writing, acting, and particularly the direction in a number of the scenes seriously detracted from what could have been a MUCH better film.",The Last Boy Scout
72,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,9,1 February 2005,"One of the last great action movies, before the days of massive CG explosions and battles kicked in, The Last Boyscout signalled the end of an era- No-one wanted to see the 'one man taking on an army' kind of film anymore, though cleverly this film shows the irony of that with its sharp script. Many critics complain about the sexism in the film (the same critics say nothing of this fact in Gone With The Wind and countless other 'Classics'. And don't give me any nonsense about how things were different back then- as long as there are men and women-there will always be sexism, and the treatment of women here is nowhere near as bad as they would have you believe). Halle Berry stars as a dancer, her character is not the sharpest, she falls for a simple trick and is killed. The men who treat women badly in the film are shown to be scumbags, and each of these men gets what they deserve. In the case of Joe's wife, she is strong, but side-lined for most of the film (she was screwing her husband's partner remember), but his daughter, played by the magnificent Danielle Harris- who makes Dakota Fanning look like she has never acted in her life, is witty, intelligent and strong, and saves the day on a couple of occasions. Yes it is a macho film, but it is aware of that fact, and that within this genre such a fact can be subverted. Admittedly this has been done much better in other films, but The Last Boy Scout still tries to be 'one for the men' mainly.Now the plot- Joe, a washed up ex-bodyguard, played by Willis, is hired to protect a washed up NFL star's dancer girlfriend. Wayans- The NFL star doesn't like it, believing he can do the job himself. When she is killed, the two form an unlikely partnership and investigate her death. The uncover a plot which involves senators, and coaches, and they race to save the life of the scumbag Senator Willis once worked for. Joe's daughter is kidnapped, and he comes to remember that family is the most important thing he has, and he will not let anything harm that. After many explosive fights, the 3 square up against the bad guys in a final encounter.The stunts are worthy of mentioning in the same breath as those of Die Hard, but as they are not in a confined space, they have less of an impact. However, the script is far superior than most action movies, and it must surly rank in the top 10 quotable movies of all time. It seems that every line of dialogue is repeatable. Wayans is excellent, almost equalling Eddie Murphy's BHCop performance, Willis is perfect as Joe, Harris proves she is easily one of the best actresses around, but for some reason she never gets the big parts, and the rest of the cast is strong. There are countless funny moments, the action (by Shane west of Predator and Die Hard fame) is adrenaline charged, and the direction is fast and controlled by Scott. This was widely overlooked for a variety of reasons, but all self-respecting action fans should definitely get this on DVD as you won't be disappointed. 9 out of 10.",The Last Boy Scout
73,bh_tafe3,Well casted with great dialogue- a fine piece of action film making,8,5 March 2015,"Following on from the big flop Hudson Hawk, Bruce Willis, with able support from Damon Wayans and Danielle Harris, comes out all guns blazing in this action classic, directed by Tony Scott.Willis stars as Joe Hallenbeck, a down on his luck Private Investigator who was once a presidential body guard, who is hired (well, sort of...watch the movie) by a stripper named Cory (a very young and very hot Halle Berry) whose received death threats. Cory meets her demise so her boyfriend, former pro footballer Jimmy Deeks (Damon Wayans), teams up with Joe to take on wealthy millionaire Shelly Marcone (Noble Willigham) and his henchmen, led by the insane Milo (Taylor Negron). Joe's daughter, Darian (Danielle Harris) also get dragged along for the ride.Willis is in Die Hard: With a Vengeance MaClane mode here, with a strong hint of Rodney Dangerfield, while Wayans finds the perfect big screen vehicle for his stand up schtick. Negron is excellent as an OTT villain with some bizarre habits, he acts like a bad guy from a lethal weapon movie.We get to see a lot of explosions and gun play, as you'd expect from a Tony Scott film, while the comedy parts in the script will have you in stitches. This is the film that reinvigorated Willis' career following the failure of Hudson Hawk, and reminded us all of how much fun buddy action movies could be if done right.

74,adrianovasconcelos,A loser all the way,1,31 October 2020,"Willis plays Willis and for his bad luck his wife in the movie seems to be Demi-faithful, sleeping with his best chum and lying about it. Willis appears to be a detective fallen on hard days, but then we see that he lives in a fairly sumptuous place. His foul mouth of a daughter makes drawings about Satan Claus, so you can tell that rating this family dysfunctional is a gross understatement.
The best pal banging his wife catches a ticket upstairs when his car blows up and Willis realizes that foul play is at hand, but that fazes him not at all. He might as well be sauntering on the set of DIE HARD.
Along comes Wayans, dead jealous over his gorgeous girlfiriend (Halle Berry). who gets all shot up, and the odd couple somehow become friends and help each other. There are some unexpected moments but the script is so poor, direction so amateurish, and acting so unconvincing that my sole regret is that I have no option but give this piece of trash one star.

76,jcbutthead86,One of the Greatest Action movies of all time. A true Classic.,10,9 July 2012,"The Last Boy Scout is one of the greatest action movies ever made that's filled with great action,unforgettable one liners,excellent script and fantastic direction and is a true classic of the Action genre.The Last Boy Scout tells the story of a former secret serviceman turned private detective named Joe Hallenbeck(Bruce Willis) and a former football player Jimmy Dix(Damon Wayans) who team up to investigate a murder. Together Joe and Jimmy are plunged into the world of sports gambling,corrupt politicians and football that is unpredictable,insane and explosive.The Last Boy Scout is an amazing movie that works for many reasons and it works as a Action film,a Film-Noir,Buddy Film and a great tale of Redemption. The Last Boy Scout brilliantly mixes together the genres of Action and Film-Noir giving viewers a dark and violent world where the Action and characters are surprising,violent and unexpected with dark humor and is done with all of the great trademarks of Action films such as shootouts,explosions and fist fights. Screenwriter Shane Black obviously loves Film Noir and Private detective stories and the Film Noir influence is on display in this film with the character Joe Hallenbeck who is a great reminder of the private detectives of the past like Phillip Marllow and Sam Spade where the Joe Hallenbeck character handles situations whether it's violence or characters with a certain cool and charm. Also with the Film Noir influence is the main characters and the dark,gritty atmosphere that TLBS sets up,where the the good guys are trying to solve the case and get the bad guys and the bad guys are corrupt,vile and vicious and with no redeeming value. TLBS also works as a great Buddy film because the two main characters Joe and Jimmy at first don't like each other,but as the film goes on the two have a great chemistry and understanding of one another and there's also a great since of humor with two characters whether they're sharing one-liners with each other or other characters. TLBS is also a tale of Redemption with Joe and Jimmy because both of these characters were at the top of their games with Joe being a secret service man and Jimmy being a star football player with both being kicked out of their professions because of past incidents. Both characters are seen as losers and in some ways solving the murder case will bring them back from the bottom to the top and they'll be seen as winners. You will relate and root for these two characters. TLBS also moves at a great pace and keeps you interested and entertained and the film always keeps you wondering what's going to happen next and the film never slows down giving viewers a high octane thrill ride and also giving viewers an amazing adrenaline rush that never quits until the very end. The Action scenes are excellent and brutal and is the kind of Action you don't see much anymore. The script by Shane Black is fantastic and in my opinion one of the best Action screenplays of all time. Like I said before Shane Black loves Film Noir and Detective stories and Black brought the same Hard-Boiled style of Dashell Hammett and Raymond Chandler to the modern world and mixed with the Action genre and created a great story. Shane Black's script is filled with great scenes and dialog bringing great Action,humor and cynicism to the film. Shane Black is one of the best Action script and screenwriters in Hollywood and this film,Lethal Weapon,Lethal Weapon 2 and his other underrated action movies The Long Kiss Goodnight,Last Action Hero,Last and his directorial debut the excellent and highly underrated Kiss Kiss Bang Bang are the reasons why. The ending of the film is amazing,Action-packed and exciting and will keep you on the edge of your seat and is a great conclusion to The Last Boy Scout.The whole cast does a great job. Bruce Willis is brilliant and gives one of his best performances as Private Detective Joe Hallenbeck bringing a likable,rugged charm and Humor to the role. Damon Wayans is excellent and funny as Jimmy Dix,a former football star. Willis and Wayans are funny together and have a great chemistry and both bring a level of depth to their characters. Chelesa Field does a great job as Joe's estranged wife Sarah. Noble Willingham does a wonderful job as villain Sheldon Marcone the owner of the football team the L.A Stallions. Danielle Harris gives a great and fun performance as Darren,Joe's foul mouthed rebellious daughter. Taylor Negron is fantastic and menacing as Milo,Sheldon's right hand man and has great scenes with Willis. Hallie Berry does a fine job in her small role as Cory,Jimmy's girlfriend. Bruce McGill(Mike Matthews),Joe Santos(Bessalo)and Chelcie Ross(Senator Baynard)also give fine performances as well.The direction by Tony Scott is excellent bringing a great atmosphere to the film with harsh lighting with the sun shining brightly during the day and with dark,fog and smoke blue neon at night. The action scenes are fast, brutal and explosive with Scott embellishing every moment moving the camera when ever Scott can. Great direction and action throughout. R.I.P Mr. Scott. The score by Michael Kamen is a great,memorable and intense and matches the tone of the film. A great score from Kamen. R.I.P Mr. Kamen.In final word,The Last Boy Scout is one of the greatest action movies of the 90's and of all time with great direction,script,and acting. If you love Action Films,Tony Scott and Shane Black I highly suggest you check out this underrated Action classic. Highly Recommended. 10/10.",The Last Boy Scout

82,buzznzipp1995,The one-liner mouth...,3,30 August 2007,"Hallenbeck, the P.I. . Good Ole' Bruce Willis, sidled-up with Damon Wayans. I would rate this a 6 and that's on the higher side for me. Don't get me wrong I did enjoy the action and adventure that these two (lead by Joe), went on. A menacing villain played (by ex-pizza delivery guy in 'Fast Times') Taylor Negron. A football team owner Sheldon 'Shelly' Marcone, (Noble Willingham, perfect choice) on the corrupt-edge and falling fast. Willis has a little John McClane only not as well as when directed by John McTiernan. I like what Tony Scott did with this, it's good, explosive, somewhat run of the mill, fast lame and funny all at once. How bizarre, for a film to mix it up that wide. This did that. Too many one-lame liners for me though. It is as if they took ""Die Hard"" and tried to out do the lingo of the McClane character. That didn't work for me. I like Willis, and if you let him just take the character and add himself into it as he should, you would get a much leaner meaner and pure mix of persona.Damon Wayans was a fun choice, I really like his style, somehow he was un-inhibited in Boyscout, maybe too much, something just didn't feel all the way with his character though. At any rate I was still into the gritty action that this offered up and in effect won two awards as well.Not by a stretch my favorite Willis movie but still a fun way to enjoy two hours, with friends or solo.

85,fredericksmith1952,Pro Football on a Friday Night with Bill Medley singing the theme song?,8,30 May 2012,"Timeline in another dimension...has to be. Pro Football on a Friday Night with Bill Medley singing the theme song? Halle Berry dancing in a strip club with silver pasties? Anyone wanting to assassinate Jimmy Carter? (well, maybe) Talk about your fantasy summer action films. I think Tony Scott knew exactly what he was doing when he got Shane Black (Lethal Weapon) to write this incredibly fast paced film with lots of twists and turns.Willis and Damons work exceptionally well off each other, and its hard to tell who's the straight man and who's the comic in several of the exchanges. I'm not quite sure which characters have the shortest film time, but not many Bad Guys survive. Bruce McGill and Kim Coates are both excellent in brief but important roles, and Taylor Negron wins the award for most villainous bad guy of the 1990's, in my opinion. Now, if you're looking for plots that make sense, forget it. This is a shoot 'em up film where Willis gets to play the irascible grouch who is ticked off about losing his job and taking it out on the world. How bad is he? Every time someone calls him a bastard, his response is: ""and then some!"". So we are not talking Oscar material, and we certainly aren't talking collectible, unless you are a big fan of Willis. (I admit it, I have a copy) Rated R for every conceivable reason in the book except maybe perversion with animals, this is definitely a see it once and enjoy the laughter and the action.",The Last Boy Scout

The prominent figures are worn out, leaving each one his personal stamp in the film; as curiosity, the exuberant appears Halle Berry in one of her first appearances on the great screen.

87,refinedsugar,Last of a dying breed,7,14 March 2001,"You look at this movie and what do you see? A patterned action movie. A patterned Bruce Willis vehicle. The simple fact is they just don't make 'em like this anymore. It gives us what we want, when we want it and that's why 'The Last Boyscout' succeeds. In instant gratification, a comfortable level of predictability and by not pulling any surprise punches. No stranger to the cracking down-and-out tough guy roles, Willis is in form and Damon Wayans makes for a surprisingly good supporting turn. 'The Last Boy Scout' shows he can carry a serious role when his thing has mainly been comedy. Written by Shane Black and with the layers striped away, it's a movie we've seen and heard before plenty 'o times. The good guys versus bad guys is pretty black and white. It's got a crackling script apt with one liners and situations perfect for action showdowns or character moments, but it also seems to have a multiple personality disorder. Dealing with the professional sport of football, the initial tone is quite serious. It all gives away to territory traveled before soon enough, but I wonder if the serious start was just to establish the dark path or was it something more. Something darker never to be? There's glimpses that the story is trying to be more than just an action trip however that sediment is far and away gone by the time we reach the wacky end as only seen in action movies, but it begs the question.At the end of the day, the Last Boyscout is everything you remember it to be. Loud, violent, politically incorrect, crude, funny and definitely quotable. The kind of light fare rift with lots of junk blowing up, cursing and little in the way of asking the viewer to think. It might pale in comparison to Willis's diverse catalog and again, the start is much stronger than the end, but it's still a hoot if you know what you're looking for!",The Last Boy Scout
88,Panterken,Bruce Willis is on fire in this great old-school action comedy. (SPOILERFREE),8,21 February 2008,"This is going to sound really cheesy but...they REALLY don't make'em like this anymore. This is a film that is as close to matching the level of Lethal Weapon and Die Hard as any early to mid '90s action flick has ever come. Damon Wayans is no Danny Glover or Sam Jackson, but there is a definite chemistry with Bruce Willis, and you can really tell on screen how much fun they're having during the shoot.The Last Boy Scout is everything a male action enthusiast can desire: there's enough wit to last three movies and the action is generously displayed by Tony Scott on screen. The pacing is actually done well for a change (which is more than can be said about most in the genre). The acting of the supporting cast may not be top notch but then again, that wasn't the case for the Lethal Weapon films and they managed to entertain me for four editions.The villains are hilariously dorky but that's part of the fun of watching these 'old' action movies. You see bad eighties haircuts and the music playing in the background is as wrong as it gets (usually 'Miami Vice'-like). Take everything with a grain (or a bag) of salt and just lay back and enjoy. There isn't a man alive who can't enjoy TLBS on some level (even if it's just as a guilty pleasure).Recommended!",The Last Boy Scout
89,jmorrison-2,"Highly Implausible, but Very Entertaining",6,11 May 2005,"One of those movies that strains plausibility to the breaking point, and beyond. However, Bruce Willis's down-on-his-luck, easy-going but tough-as-nails character makes this work. At least, in whatever alternate universe this stuff could possibly happen, anyway. The American Public is fed up with pro football?...yeah...right. Damon Wayans does not look or act like a seasoned professional quarterback, some of the football players look woefully out of shape and overweight, a prominent politician is a sexual psychopath, and nobody has a clue?. Hmmm...Anyway, Willis's pull-up-a-chair, have-a-beer, guy-next-door character works, and makes this an enjoyable action movie. He is a tough guy when he needs to be, but yet is vulnerable in his relationships with his wife and daughter. He becomes a character that you root for.Many of the other actors work well also, even in this cartoon plot. Not an award winner, but a decent enough way to spend a couple of hours.",The Last Boy Scout
90,David_Brown,Bruce Willis's Best Film,10,17 June 2014,"I am a huge Bruce Willis fan, I have seen almost film he ever made, even obscure Titles like ""Lucky Number Slevin"" and ""Breakfast Of Champions"" and this movie has everything you could possibly want in an movie, including his best performance. It starts with Writer Shane Black, Producer Joel Silver and Director Tony Scott, including the opening where Bill Medley sings ""Friday Night's A Great Night For Football."" Where should I start? Lets look at his ex Secret Service Agent turned Private Eye Joe Hollenback. Hallenback was the most abused PI since the days of ""Harry O's"" Harry Orwell (David Janssen), and Jim Rockford (James Garner), characters that obviously were inspirations because you actually see Joe Santos (Becker), playing Hallenback's only friend Bessalo (in a similar friend/Cop role that he played on the ""Rockford Files."") What does he have to deal with? Utter disrespect from everyone around him, including his wife Sarah (Chelsea Field), sleeping with the corrupt, woman beating Senator Baynard (Chelcie Ross), who got him fired from the Secret Service, for breaking his nose. By the way this would be repeated the next year, in ""Live Wire"" where Danny O'Neill (Pierce Brosnan), has exactly the same issue (including O'Neill having to try and save Corrupt Senator Frank Traveres, like Hallenback must do here. For as Jimmy Dix (Damon Waynas) said ""I figure you gotta be the dumbest guy in the world, Joe. You're trying the save the life of the man who ruined your career, and avenge the death of the guy that f--ked your wife."" Even his daughter Darian(Danielle Harris) has no love or respect for him. Throw in the mob, crooked Football Team Owner, Sheldon Marcone (Noble Willingham), alcoholism, and suffering constant physical abuse, and you know that he has issues. Of course, he has plenty of One Liners that would make John McClane (""Die Hard"") blush. Including (Spoilers ahead) a scene involving Darian, Dix, who becomes his reluctant partner, a psychotic hit man named Milo (Taylor Negron), the mob, and a puppet, that is a classic. The funny thing is Hallenback has the LEAST amount of issues here. Spoilers: For example: Dix has a Coke problem and his girlfriend Halle Berry is a Prostitute who gets murdered at the orders of Marcone. Does Hallenback win in the end? Of course, check out his ""Stadium Dance"" and final battle against Milo, but how he does it is something to behold. Also what Dix does to Senator Baynard are Classics, of course, the ""Puppet Scene"" that I will not spoil. a very easy 10/10 Stars.",The Last Boy Scout
91,blazesnakes9,Same old formula picture that does work,7,31 August 2014,"In the opening scene of The Last Boy Scout, the movie starts off with a series of unexpected violence with a pro football player shooting himself in the head at close range. Now why did that happen? According to a unknown source, the player knows for a fact that he isn't going to score an touchdown and therefore, ends up blowing his brains out on the field.Cut to the early morning. Joe Hallenbeck, (Bruce Willis), is resting in his car when suddenly a couple of street punks decide to drop a dead squirrel in his car. The punks think Joe has fallen for the trick, but he proves them wrong. Hallenbeck's job is a private detective. His main job is to protect an stripper, (Halle Berry), who has been receiving threats from someone. Who is that sending those threats? Hallenbeck doesn't know. His investigation deepens when he encounters the stripper's boyfriend, (Damon Wayans), an disgraced quarterback who was kicked out of the game because of his drug abuse. After the quarterback's girlfriend is shot to death, the duo decides to investigates together. But that isn't going to be easy. At first, they trade insults between the two of them. Later on, they realize that they need one another to continue their investigation.The story of The Last Boy Scout is not at all original, however. The reason why is because it was written by the screenwriter who wrote Lethal Weapon 1 and 2. When I first heard of the plot of this movie, I immediately thought of Lethal Weapon. The plot of the movie leads the two completely different strangers into much more bigger things. Their clues leads them to the world of sports gambling, make that, illegal sports gambling. Among the bad guys in the movie is a character named Milo, (Taylor Negron), who is perhaps the most despicable of them all. From the looks of it, I have seen The Last Boy Scout several times over the last 4 years and all I can say is that my criticism is the same as it was 4 years ago. There are several good moments in the movie, but most of them come from the thrilling action sequences. There are a number of great stunts in the movie such as the finale where one character is hanging off a light tower while hanging onto a chain linked barrier. That some good stuff. There is a level of humor in the movie and those come from the funny jokes that Willis and Wayans mentioned in the movie.However, I was very concerned about the structure of the movie. I've said before that this is not a original movie and I guess it shouldn't be. But I felt that the dialogue should have been tone down because the movie littered with four letter words and sometimes twelve letter words. Most of the profanity comes from Willis' daughter, (Danelle Harris), who, in one particular scene, squares off against her father to see who can say the most bad words. Besides that, I also noticed the atmosphere of the movie, which is very mean-spirited and at certain times, unpleasant. That kind of atmosphere comes into place when we first meet Willis and Wayans. The way they talk to one another is sometimes funny. I have to admit that I did laugh at some of their bickering. But, the problem is that the way Willis and Wayans treated the women in their lives is very cruel. There's a subplot involving Willis' wife having an affair with someone else. On the other side, Wayans treats his stripper girlfriend very cruelly. I supposed there's a reason to all this.The violence in this movie is pretty bloody and like the language, I wish the editor of the movie would tone down the violence because I felt at certain times, it border on the unnecessary kind. Shane Black, who wrote the script for the movie was paid an hefty price for the script and I supposed the script would have to be pretty popular to made into a formula picture.All I can say is the movie works on a technical level. I especially like the actions sequences of the movie. But, the storytelling is not at all original. Director Tony Scott, who made Top Gun 5 years ago, does know how to make energetic action pictures. He certainly knows how to deliver. But, on the storytelling process, he doesn't know how to come up with a fresh story to tell. Yet, I think that is the reason why The Last Boy Scout works. Audiences don't really care about the story. They only care about the action sequences and the stunts. I did have that craving inside of me. I know for a fact that for a movie-goer to be turned on by the thrill of an action movie, one would have to be in the right mood for the movie. I was in the mood to see The Last Boy Scout. I knew that it was going to be a action film from the get-go, but I couldn't really buy most of what the movie had to offer, meaning the story and the plot. For a movie to work, I have to give The Last Boy Scout 3 stars for the technical aspects for the movie. As I said before, they do work. But, not the story. I guess I'm being too kind. With this being said, I've cut you some slack. ★★★ 3 stars.",The Last Boy Scout
92,jcanettis,Typical Bruce Willis Action Flick,6,7 October 2006,"If you watched ""The Last Boy Scout"", and at some point thought that this could be perhaps be some sort of prequel (or sequel) of the ""Die Hard"" series, do not worry; it is an absolutely natural reaction, since ""TLBS"" is another typical Bruce Willis action flick, where he plays his favorite role: He is the good guy, who has marriage (or other personal) problems, and although starts as a loser, he quickly shows us his wits, stamina, and strength, by chasing the bad guys to death. We have seen this theme in ""Die Hard 1"", ""Die Hard 2"", ""Die Hard 3"", ""16 Blocks"", etc etc.And yet, for some strange reason, it is still a twisted pleasure to watch Bruce play this stubborn role. He has a charisma for it, and his movies are the proof: Not that he has not played other important roles in excellent films, as well (""The 6th sense"", ""Unbreakable"", and ""Twelve Monkeys"" are some great examples). It is simply than in films like ""TLBS"" he provides us with easy-to-swallow action, fun, and clever one-liners that we enjoy...So, let's see what ""TLBS"" is about. The story involves private investigator Joe Hallenbeck (Willis) who lives a miserable life. When he discovers that his wife Sarah (Field) is banged by a colleague, things look as they cannot get worse; and yet they can, as the colleague dies in a suspicious accident, thus handing Hallenbeck the last job he had before his death, which was the protection of a strip-dancer, Cory (Berry). Cory's boyfriend, an ex-quarterback (Wayans) is unsympathetic to Hallenberg and his task at first, but when Cory gets murdered, he teams up with him to find the killer.As I explained above, the film is exactly what you would expect: Fast action, implausible but entertaining plot, and funny one-liners all around. Performances are satisfactory, especially if judged by the film genre. All in all, two fun hours: 6/10.",The Last Boy Scout
93,cutter-12,Lethal Garbage,1,31 December 2006,"Shane Black really hit his stride with this mindless regurgitation of his own Lethal Weapon. Did he actually write this script with a word processor or wipe it out of his butt on a role of toilet paper? There are more unnecessary F bombs in this than there are flying bullets, crashing cars and plot holes combined. Only, unlike a film say like Get Shorty, there is very little wit to go with the endless profanity. Sure, teenage boys and IQ-challenged redneck men - and of course Quentin Tarantino - will have found Willis and Wayans' profane quips and one liners hilarious, but I just found it to be tiresome and stupidly unnecessary dialogue. Especially when the kid is spewing it. Nice touch there by all involved.But then again, the whole movie was unnecessary spew. Stupid plot to do with corruption in pro football and politics, familial dysfunction, infidelity, and a couple of gun packing losers caught in the middle of it all conspires to make one of the most implausible, noisy, badly filmed and edited action crapfests of all time. Tony Scott can bite me with his pumped up, testosterone charged, colored light filtered, sloppy direction and camera-work. And Shane Black can bite me twice for the hackneyed piece of crap he called a script.Bruce Willis just bites in general. I normally miss most of the stuff he's in because he just doesn't give a damn about how bad a script is before he signs on, but sometimes I need a movie fix and there's nothing on but swill like this.I've always thought Willis looks a lot in some pictures like Dick Powell when Powell starred in those classic hard-boiled film noirs of the 40's and 50's such as Murder, My Sweet and Cry Danger. And someone must have told Willis that on the set because he's pretty much doing a Powell imitation here, though the dialogue often lets him down.The dialogue in those Powell noirs was consistently crisp, tough and hip, and spoken accordingly by actors who had talent. In The Last Boy Scout writer Black is so desperately wanting to emulate that kind of snazzy dialogue that he often paints himself into a corner, ending up handing Willis or Wayans an adolescent howler to finish off a back and forth. But then, amid the endless assault of profanity, who really noticed?I won't even get into the disturbing misogyny littered throughout this waste of film. A most unenjoyable night at the movies.

94,Newsense,The most underrated buddy cop flick of all time,10,9 December 2008,"You cant talk about underrated action flicks without mentioning The Last Boy Scout. I mean this movie came and went and stayed off the radar for a while. Let me give you a brief description of what its about.Bruce Willis plays Joe Hallenback, a down on his luck private investigator who comes home and finds his best friend sleeping with his wife. He later teams up with an ex-football player named Jimmy Dix(Damon Wayans) whose girlfriend Cory(Halle Berry) just got murdered.Opinion: Lets do a quintessential buddy cop checklist and see if this movie meets those requirements.Does it feature an unlikely pairing? Check. Does the unlikely pairing work well together? Check. Does it have moments of humor since one of the stars is a comic? Check. Does it give you one hell of ride from start to finish? CheckSo what the hell are these people expecting? This was made to be a popcorn flick but it was one hell of popcorn flick. Bruce Willis still shined as the action hero of the movie. Damon Wayans was funny but he also fared well when it was time to do a serious scene. I still laugh at the scene where Jimmy claims that Joe has to be the dumbest man on planet Earth because Joe is trying to solve the murder of the same best friend who slept with his wife. The audience still cares even we we come to the realization also. This movie came out at a time when you can expect a good action flick and the director Tony Scott hadn't dropped the ball yet in that department. If you don't expect Oscar material you might like this one but I still think its one of the most underrated buddy cop movies of all time.",The Last Boy Scout

No prizes for guessing which category this one falls into.My favourite action movie is 'Die Hard' (the original, not the pumped up sequels), but I don't mind telling you: this one ain't far behind. There are cars, guns, chases and foul language, and you can cut the testosterone with a spade. Exactly the way it should be. And some of the funniest dialogue you'll ever hear.Bruce Willis was made for this kind of movie, and his shambolic, wise-cracking Joe Hallenbeck is easily his best creation since John McClane. Damon Wayans, who I don't normally like, is also surprisingly good as the sidekick; and Danielle Harris must have been the envy of the 8th grade when she made this.

He's a borderline alcoholic, his wife can't stand him, they argue constantly and she is cheating on him with his best friend, his bratty daughter hates his guts and other cops think he's a liability.
I won't go in to the plot too much in case you haven't seen it but he is soon teamed up with a disgraced pro football player played by Damon Wayans on a job to track down the murderer of Wayans' girlfriend and it progresses from there.Strap yourself in -The movie is gloriously violent, the banter between the two leads is hilarious, politically incorrect and harsh and it's basically non stop mayhem from start to finish.
If i had to compare it to a more recent movie it would be 2016's awesome War On Everyone crossed with Lethal Weapon.if you want to see a balls to the wall, badass action movie which will put hair on your shaft then this is definitely recommended, it's a hell of a good time.",The Last Boy Scout

When she is brutally killed by a group of gangsters, Joe meets her boyfriend Jimmy Dix (Damon Wayans) who used to be the quaterback for the L.A. Stallions. Together, Joe and Jimmy follow clues that they hope will lead up to why Cory was murdered. Also, they find out clues about how the owner of the L.A. Stallions, Sheldon Marcone (Noble Willingham) is working on a plan to legalize sports gambling. Joe and Jimmy also encounter the ruthless mob leader Milo (Taylor Negron) throughout a day of chaos and action!I thought that The Last Boy Scout was a great movie with everything that an action-adventure type should have. That includes: action, suspense, one-liners, sex, chain smoking, brain blowing, ect.Produced by Joel Silver, and directed by Tony Scott. Starring Bruce Willis (The Kid, Unbreakable) and Damon Wayans (My Wife & Kids, Bamboozled). The Last Boy Scout will blow you out of your seat!!!!!!!",The Last Boy Scout

We had this movie on VHS at home but I never bothered watching it, I really don't know why. This movie was just excellent!Bruce Willis stars as this cynical and smart detective who has had a rough family life and Damon Wayans stars as an ex-football star. They team up together to solve a murder case which involves a football team and a politician.This movie has a lot of genius action scenes and a very smart plot. I would definitely watch this movie again with my friends. This movie represents Bruce Willis' great action movie era, truly one of his best movies from the 90s.",The Last Boy Scout

It doesn't do anything earth shattering in terms of inventive plots, twists, or action sequences, but that doesn't make it a bad movie.  Bruce Willis (Die Hard Trilogy, The Sixth Sense) and Damon Wayans (Bulletproof, The Great White Hype) star in this movie. I give it 2 1/2 *'s out of 4 *'s.

103,Jona1988,Brilliant movie that is unfortunately still underrated and unfairly forgotten by most,8,22 March 2018,"Die Hard in all but name. The Last Boy Scout is one underrated and unfairly overlooked gem. It is actually one of my favourite Bruce Willis movies. In many ways it might seem like the standard action movie that he has done so many times but there is much more to this movie. It has many similarities in the feel of it to the Die Hard series and Willis character Joe Hallenbeck is pretty much John McClane. So far that this movie could easily have been transformed into a Die Hard movie with minor rewrites. The Last Boy Scout is a far worthier sequel than the fourth and fifth movie, that pretty much goes without saying but it might actually be better than the second one as well. The Last Boy Scout was written by Shane Black and it has all his trademarks, humour, interesting story and great characters . The plot is really surprisingly well written much more complicated than one would be expecting. Action movies seldom focus much on the story because it´s not the selling point. The Last Boy Scout has a great plot that takes many surprising twists and requires your attention all the way through. The first time I saw it I didn´t grasp how it all hung together. Then there's the dialogue which is just excellent. So many memorable and hilarious quotes perfectly delivered and most of them by Bruce Willis. Brilliant dialogue is just obvious if you know Shane Black and have seen Kiss Kiss Bang Bang or more recently The Nice Guys. Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans are perfect in the leads as two unmatched buddies that are forced together. Allegedly they did not get along but maybe it was to the movies advantage. Taylor Negron is likewise great as the menacing villain. The action is thrilling and very brutal. What´s great however is that it´s well thought out and not overdone like that it goes on for too long and just becomes cartoonishly over the top like often happens. The action is sporadic but totally intense and thrilling when it comes. Of course it´s not realistic but more thought out than many. Great directing from Tony Scott. The Last Boy Scout is a top-notch comedy action thriller unfairly forgotten that hopefully is being or should be rediscovered.",The Last Boy Scout

105,cormac_zoso,One of the great buddy films,10,8 January 2015,"This may not be a movie for everyone, but this is one of the best buddy films in history. Bruce Willis expertly plays a burned-out cynical private eye, Joe Hallenbeck, once a Secret Service agent who saved the president's life, who gets a hot scary case dumped in his lap by his private eye partner, who also just happened to be screwing Hallenbeck's wife. All this leads to a protection job on Halley Barry, exotic dancer and boyfriend of Damon Wayans', Jimmy Dix is his character, a former pro football quarterback for the Los Angeles franchise. Berry, Cory, has a tape and other evidence that Senator Baynard, who got Hallenback fired from his Secret Service job. Baynard and Sheldon Marcone, owner of the L.A. franchise, are conspiring to get sports betting legalized in California. This is of course all under the table dealing and bribes, etc.So Hallenback and Dix team up, reluctantly, to find Cory's killers as they keep stumbling deeper into the true nature of the scam going on.Not to go into any more of the scam's specifics but the team of Hallenback and Dix eventually come to an understanding and head together into the mouth of deep dark secrets of the rich and powerful. Wisecracks and gallows humor pervade as we follow the two through their eventual victory against the rich and powerful. Plenty of laughs and plenty of big-time stunts and wild fights follow and it's a movie you'll be quoting for years to come. Just Hallenback's comments about rap music are worth the price of the rental.It's a shame Tony Scott, brother of Ridley, passed on so soon. He has a deft touch directing this wild and funny romp through and around the authorities and the bad guys as he gets perfect tone in the acting of Willis and Dix.It's a shame they didn't find a way to do a sequel. Though perhaps that might have been just another second-tier job that pales in comparison to the original.If you're looking for a night of Bruce Willis mayhem flicks, you can start with this one, move onto ""Last Man Standing"", and wrap it up with ""Die Hard"" or ""The Fifth Element"" ... or both ... stay up late with lots of popcorn and enjoy the smart-ass mayhem.",The Last Boy Scout
106,logicproreviews,A flop that a whale would be proud of.,3,4 September 2020,"After the mammoth success of Die Hard, it made sense to put Bruce Willis into a few action flicks and cash in on box office returns. A few Die Hard knockoffs followed - where he showed up to parody himself and Die Hard. The very forgettable (Die Hard on a boat) Striking Distance is one example of this.The Last Boy Scout is a proper Christmas Turkey of a whopping, disastrous mess. There is no plot. There are continuity errors everywhere. The stunt doubles are laugh out loud stand outs.The characters are wooden, the dialogue is laughable. The faux buddy relationship between Willis and Wayans is flat and the characters have absolutely no chemistry.This is a movie about explosions and jumps and not much else.3/10 for the effort but this really is a terrible movie and has aged terribly.",The Last Boy Scout
107,StudentDriver,"Mean-tempered, foul-mouthed... and the best ""buddy-cop"" movie around.",9,16 October 1999,"When I try to describe this movie to people who've never seen it, I always start out with the worst adjectives.  This movie is so incredibly mean-spirited and hateful, that it's a wonder no one suggested that the movie was unreleasable.Thank God, however, the movie came out.  This is the perfect antidote to the oh-so-funny Lethal Weapon movies, and is a logical successor to the original Die Hard.  Bruce Willis plays the over-the-top hardcore private detective; he's got the world's worst relationships, the world's worst family life. His best friend dies after cheating with Bruce's wife.  His life is dark and dreary, and he cuts through it all with an acid tongue and a lot of misanthropy.Damon Wayans plays a drug-using ex-football star whose life just can't get back on track.  His girlfriend dies trying to get his old job, the only thing that means anything to him, back.  With her death, Damon and Bruce join together to form a bickering, hateful team that goes after corruption in football and politics, saves the President, saves Bruce's marriage and family life, gets Damon off of drugs (temporarily, in all likelihood), and causes lots of blood splatters, explosions, and deaths.Sure, the script is unbelievable.  Sure, the dialogue causes 3rd degree burns.  (The interpersonal bickering *does* get tiresome; by the time Bruce and Damon are searching Damon's girlfriend's apartment, I am fed up with the snippiness...)  But the whole movie is so damn entertaining because of it all!  Unlike Rambo or whatever, this movie makes no pretensions towards respectability or patriotism.

Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans have really good chemistry with each other which is surprising since you wouldn't think with that combination that it would work, but it does. The supporting cast also does well especially the late Taylor Negron who plays a great henchman to the main villain.

I wanted to see if I could buy any other of the films she's been in. The Last Boy Scout was the first one outside of the Halloween series. I watched it from beginning to finish, and I liked the film. Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans did very well together in this film. The Joe Hallenbeck character seems very similar to John McClain. Both are having marital troubles (John is divorced and Joe's wife is sleeping around on him), both are in some sort of law enforcement (John is an NYPD cop but Joe is a P.I.), both are wise asses and love to use a plethora (excess, overabundance, surplus) of profanity, and both characters kick a lot of ass and get the living sh*t beaten out of them in the process. Thos are some similarities that I can come up with off the top of my head. Don't get me wrong; I'm not saying The Last Boy Scout is a knock off of Die Hard. There are some predictable parts in the film, however. The biggest one for me was the fact that Joe's daughter decided to get involved with trying to find her dad after he was kidnapped. If that doesn't scream her ending up as a hostage towards the climax of the movie, I don't know what does. Other than some of the predictable stuff in the movie, it is definitely something that I recommend to any action-loving individual.",The Last Boy Scout
113,buyjesus,pakt wth axion like sardine kans in a tin box,8,20 July 2001,"Spoilers watching this movie reminded me of the simpsons episode where homer and mel gibson remake mr. smith goes to washington. ""When did the country lose its way?"" lamented mr. simpson "" When did we stop rooting for the guy with the machine gun?""back when bruce willis was famous for killing every mofo in the room, he made this; tony scott's powerful and moving indictment of the corporate corruption that has destroyed once honorable institutions like pro-football......then he threw away that script and made this movie....which is about killing people. make no mistake, that's all this movie is about.and is there anything wrong with? it's even self-aware. as bruce willis exclaims at one point when a character tries to explain himself ""who gives a f***? you're the bad guy, right?""  (oooh, irony)  That's all you need to know. They're the bad guys, he's the good guy, along with former quarterback James Dixx (played by Damon Wayans), and a lot of people get shot.there's dialogue that's sardonic and cynical to the point of almost placing the good guys in an anti-hero stature. bruce willis doesn't care about anyone or anything and that's what makes him cool. because he doesn't learn his lesson by the end and he continues to not give a s***.  Maybe this is just a John McClane redux, that same character who has completely given up on the world after having to go through the same ordeal over the course of three movies. these movies are made for when you want to get the bad guys yourself. you live vicariously through these characters, which is simple, because they can easily adopt your personality, seeing as they have none of their own. and what's wrong with that?characters die left and right with little emotional baggage (see damon wayans witness his girlfriend's death, watch bruce willis see his best friend die....you've never seen anyone more inert)from the superb opener which features a PCP-addled football player making some rather rash decisions on the field to the closer where the bad guy bites it in one of those wrong-time-at-the-wrong-place situations that could only happen at the movies (oops...don't want to give away that the bad guy dies in the end,) this is an entertaining flick through and through. the kind that hollywood doesn't even make anymore. you won't be upset if you know what's in store",The Last Boy Scout

Sure, it can pretty much be narrowed down as a cliché 90's action movie, but it has more style and personality than most. Bruce Willis (basically reprising his role from Die Hard) and Damon Wayans make a much better team than they had any right to on the big screen. I got the sense that they were actually friends, and their relationship in the film is interesting for the most part. Scott had a flair for directing slick action sequences in his earlier films, and this is a prime example. Unlike in a lot of his later work, the action here is coherent and very satisfying. The script by Shane Black is easily the best one he wrote post-Lethal Weapon 2; it has crackling dialogue and simply a great sense of humor, as well as two solid main villains who are actually deadly and efficient. It also has a good amount of character to it, which I feel was lacking from some of the later Scott action movies, which mostly focused on style over substance. As for the daughter character, I found her slightly annoying at times, but even her presence helps set the movie apart from other gritty action films of its era. Overall, it's simply a fun time, even if it's just a mid-tier Tony Scott film.",The Last Boy Scout

There were some good ones along the way, but the nineties ended with bad films and the same is going for the 2000's. The film does show halle berry in a strip dance which is quite interesting. But bad boys didn't need a sequel and it got one, a little late might i add, rambo got sequels, didn't need one. The Last Boy scout surely deserves a sequel seeing how it ended, Bruce Willis and Damon wayans are hilarious together. Though Willis delivers most of the laughs and all the action, but id still love to see them pair up again. They can have all their swearing of the original and not overload it with violence like bad boys 2 and mission impossible 3.

123,2001mmFilm,A Masterpiece Out of the Blue,10,3 December 2020,"Kinetic. It's a good word to describe The Last Boy Scout, the last true buddy-cop film of all - signalling the end of an era for one of my absolute favourite movie genres. This film flaunts the style, look and feel of a Tony Scott joint, and you're always waiting for some golden one-liners from screenwriter Shane Black, on top form here.To recall the kinetic nature of the film, The Last Boy Scout can be defined as pure cinematic entertainment. Scene after scene, it doesn't relent in giving you something to revel at. Comedy, action, heart - The Last Boy Scout is everything I needed it to be. A wonderful, wonderful movie.Bruce Willis' multi-dimensional Joe Hallenbeck and Damon Wayans' wry ex footballer Jimmy Dix are a terrific pairing. You know chemistry when you see it. There's a little gem of a moment where, upon making an insult to Jimmy (Wayans), the former footballer goes in to punch Joe (Willis) in the face, yet the P.I catches Jimmy's fist right as it's coming toward him and defuses it's power with only one hand. It's not only cool as Hell, but wholly surprising. The same can be said for the final 1991 product.Reportedly, production was strained between cast and crew creatively - But I can't see HOW or WHERE any of this translated into the movie whatsoever. The Last Boy Scout may not warrant to feature in anyone's Top 20 of all time - But for me to exclude it would be dishonest. On what merits do we judge a film? Technicalities? Surely not. The Last Boy Scout excels here either way, in it's cinematography, direction and sound design to name a few. No, we judge a film based on whether or not it impressed us emotionally.

124,AngryMovieNerd,The Last Boy Scout is graphically violent and profane with a strong hatred towards women...but I still like it. (* * * out of * * * *),7,15 October 2005,"In a 1991 review of the film, The Last Boy Scout (1991), Chicago Sun-Times film critic Roger Ebert awarded the film three stars (out of ****)while pointing out that, ""The only consistent theme of the film is its hatred of women."" By providing readers with this quote, and watching the movie, it is hard to disagree. This film is rotten to the core, and definitely not for the faint of heart. Here's a movie where women are bullied around, gunned down, and attacked with verbal violence, by being called bitches, whores and worse.But The Last Boy Scout does succeed in deliver a good, violent action picture. The result is a cross between 48 Hrs. (1982, another film produced by Joel Silver) and bits of Lethal Weapon (1987, another film written by Shane Black and produced by Silver).Bruce Willis plays Joe Hallenbeck, a former Secret Service agent turned private detective. Damon Wayans is Jimmy Dix, a former football player. Both men have a wife and girlfriend who cheat on them--Hallenbeck's wife (Chelsea Field) is sleeping with his friend, while Jimmy's girlfriend (Halle Berry), a stripper, has prostituted herself.Hallenbeck's hired to protect the stripper, and when she ends up killed, he forms an uneasy partnership with her boyfriend, the disgraced Jimmy, who was banned from the football league for gambling. Meanwhile, a corrupt team owner (Noble Willingham) wants to buy legislators and legalize gambling on pro football.The Last Boy Scout is laced with a strong amount of graphic violence, and the bad guys, who are not there to make the good guys look good, meet a lot of gruesome and bloody ends. The film has some exciting and thrilling action sequences and the surprises are startling.But the most disturbing moments are with Hallenbeck's foul-mouth 13-year old daughter, Darian (Danielle Harris), when she and her dad curse at each other, and later on when she gets a gun to her head. She is also an enthusiastic witness to the many gruesome and violent events that culminate in the film's brutal finale.Bruce Willis gives a solid performance, while showing remnants of John McClane from Die Hard (1988) and Damon Wayans gives a comic persona as Jimmy Dix. And Taylor Negron, who is the most despicable villain of all gives a chilling performance as one of the villains who has the annoying habit of calling people by their elongated names.Shane Black's screenplay is filled with funny and intelligent dialogue, a strong use of profanity and vulgarity and snappy one-liners, and director Tony Scott (who directed the terrible sequel, Beverly Hills Cop II [1987]) keeps the film at a dark pace, and surprises us by turning up the volume on car chases, death scenes, and gunshots. The best moment occurs when in one scene the comedy is interrupted by the violence.The Last Boy Scout is a near-perfect action movie, in the tradition of other buddy movies such as 48 Hrs., and Lethal Weapon, and while it is not as good as the latter movies, it sets the benchmark for extreme violence and carnage in action movies. Here is a movie that throws graphic violence at us, while the viewer is stunned into uneasy silence.",The Last Boy Scout

128,devinshee,Good Old Early 90's R Rated Action Movie,8,23 September 2007,"The Last Boy Scout is a good old early 90's R rated action movie. They don't really make them like this anymore. It kind of does seem like those good old action movies are coming back a little bit, i think. It seems it has been that way the past 3 or 4 years. I think that 1997-2001 were the worst years for movies, most of all there were practically no action movies throughout those years, and that goes for a little bit of 2002 i guess, but basically 2002 is when movies started to get back on their feet a little bit, especially action movies, or even R rated action movies, like Bad Boys 2 and so on. It seems that movies have gotten a little old school these past few years which is cool. And, there have been no R rated action movies during those bad years of movies. Although there aren't action movies like the Last Boy Scout anymore, but movies do have an old school feel to them now, I mean we have John Rambo coming out next year, and we have Live Free or Die Hard now, and Indiana Jones is comiing back. The classic good old action movies are coming back. Anyway about The Last Boy Scout. Its a pretty cool movie, funny, fun, action packed, loud, foul mouthed, swearing with a passion, and also yelling with a passion, car chases, shootouts, violence. Its a pretty brutal and violent movie, and kind of bloody. There is always someone getting punched and beaten up which is funny. Very loud punches, gunshots, sound effects. And it has that very typical early 90's look to it, that atmosphere, with the way the camera makes the movie look. Movies don't really look like that anymore, and that style. And the movie has very good bad guys, and they are very mysterious. The Milo character is very funny, and he has a cool death with a helicopter blade. And a lot of good old bloody faces in this. There may be quite a lot of special effects and stuff these days, but i don't care. There are some action movies today that don't have much special effects, like The Last Boy Scout.Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans are great together, and they both have problems with drug addiction and drunkiness. They are big smartasses toward each other. And the movie has good music by Michael Kamen, intense music. Its a cool action packed movie. A pure guy, typical 90's action movie, funny one liners. Its as early 90's as it can get. The early 90's was a great era for action movies.",The Last Boy Scout
129,MovieMaster95,The Movie That Defines 'Underated'!,8,19 November 2010,"Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans team up in this buddy action flick which is all the better thanks to Shane Black's witty and dark script.Back when explosions were cool, action heroes were badass and one liners were clever and hilarious.Bruce Willis is Joe Hallenbeck, a dark and cynical private detective who has a sarcastic comment for any insult that comes his way. Think John McClane if he didn't care about living. Damon Wayons on the other hand plays Jimmy Dix, a down and out American football player who has become a drug addict and womaniser. After Jimmy's girlfriend is murdered the two team up to take down the criminals who did it, not knowing what they're getting into.The plot is straight forward and nothing really special, but it's whats in the movie that makes it worth seeing. Memorable characters, violent action scenes, lack of CGI and some of the best, funniest and most quotable one liners in any film to this very day. An action packed ride from start to finish, the film is true 90's action. While it wasn't a commercial hit, fans who did see it, love it as one of Bruce Willis' best and an all out uncensored, brutal and badass guy flick!",The Last Boy Scout
130,irrelevantlife,An absolute classic that would have never been made in this day and age,9,28 April 2020,"The last boy scout is perhaps the epitome of the slapstick, frantic and highly entertaining breed of 90's action movies. It ticks off all of the boxes that were associated with this kind of movie back in the day, and it does it so well that in my humble opinion stands the test of time.Shane Black's script and story is simply awesome and late great director Tony Scott holds nothing back in this hybrid of ""Die Hard"" meets ""Lethal weapon"". Willis is here in his best action years, displaying a cool demeanour whilst cracking jokes left and right and just not giving a damn. Likewise, his unexpected alley superbly well played by Damon Wayans is the perfect counterweight to Willis' character, and the movie soon teaches us that if only the two can find a way to stand each other then they become nigh unbeatable.Much can be said about the movie's plot and how it intertwines action, humour and tragedy into one big monster, but one thing is certain it would not have been made today. This is a pure man-oriented guilty pleasure with jokes and themes which would make a modern women's blood boil. The movie depicts women as being unreliable and careless individuals, and even Willis' character's daughter is scrutinised to an unhealthy degree by her dad just be he confronts his wife in a pivotal moment early in the movie.It is perhaps this lack of balance and a focus on macho energy that ultimately gives the movie its strengths - The movie makers here are not afraid to offend and will happily do so if it can get another joke in for the audience to laugh about. Another hallmark is how the script is literally filled with gags and jokes, where almost every scene has some underlying humour tucked within it whether it be light or dark.Re-watching this classic just reaffirms its qualities to me time and time again, the script, actors, direction, music, and set pieces all just fit together to form at off-beat buddy cop action flick that just might make you enjoy every second of its unadulterated madness.",The Last Boy Scout

Why? Because he doesn't give a ****. And he is perfekt for the part. Hilarious.",The Last Boy Scout
132,Joe S.,"Just ignore the fact that C-4 doesn't explode when you shoot it, and you'll have a great time.",10,18 January 2000,"OK, watching this movie is one of my most guilty pleasures.  (That and seeing ""Fight Club."")  However, one cannot deny such a well-made and thoroughly entertaining movie.  I really wasn't a fan of the ""Lethal Weapon"" series because it was just so happy at the end of the first and the more crowd-pleasing sequels.  This shows a more realistic action and a prediction of things to come for professional sports.  (Except for the small fact that LA doesn't have a team anymore) Right Wing conspirators lay off; this is true blood-pumping entertainment despite foul-mouth, gun toting heroes and villains. The story takes place in gloomy, smog-covered LA where football players are willing to kill to make the point spread.  Here, Detective Joseph Halenbeck (Willis) and former pro Jimmie Dicks (Damon Wayens) are fighting cops, corruption, and nafarious punks in cheap suits.  Stacked against them is a Jerry Jones-ish owner named Shelley Marcone, slimey henchgoon Milo who has a habit of calling people by their full names, and other various enemies from every walk of life from a pimp-lookin' guy who loves ""Yo Mama"" jokes to an ill-tempered punk with a rather extensive vocabulary, and even Joe's family life has its problems. What makes this movie really explode is the chemistry and certain believable aspects of the movie.  All the characters, especially Joe and Jimmy, interact perfectly and give the maximum quality of Shane Black's one-liners.  Listening to this makes me feel that maybe buddy action movies aren't so brain dead after all.  (Then I watch Wild Wild West.  That snaps me back into place.) Also, while the action is a stretch, many of the events themselves are believable.  Rather than having the seriously warped backstory (Mel in Lethal Weapon just happened to be connected with South African terrorism?!  Riiiiiiiiiiight.), the movie has Joe as an ex-secret service agent at the right place at the right time.  It's still hard to swallow, but hey, it's a movie, OK?! What can I say?  The movie's exciting, funny, ravenous, and cool. The best buddy movie if I have anything to say about it.",The Last Boy Scout
133,daltonml-1,Love This Movie! Was A High School Favorite Of Mine!,10,22 June 2008,"I saw this movie three times in the theater with a buddy of mine when we were still in high school. Yes, Three Times! And it got better each time I saw it. Before too long, I could recite every line spoken by Bruce Willis in the movie because at one point, Willis was my hero. I even copied his hairstyle and mannerisms, without getting busted, of course. This movie had more action and humor in it for the time. Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans were a poor man's version of Mel Gibson and Danny Glover of the ""Lethal Weapon"" saga. And nothing could stop these guys to be the heroes of the moment! To me, I found ""The Last Boy Scout"" an excellent, Hilario's adventure from start to finish. In fact, I loved it so much the first time, I refused to take a bathroom break during the final 30 minutes of the film because I feared I would miss a great action scene or so. What's missing about ""The Last Boy Scout"", sadly to tell you, is a sequel. I hoped and prayed that it would come to be in the future. But it never materialized or any news came through. A real bummer because the ending left the door wide open for a ""Last Boy Scout Part 2"". But I definitely do not want a sequel with different actors playing Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans' roles should there be one. These guys kicked Major League Ass! You Can't Miss This One By Any Means, Buddy!",The Last Boy Scout
134,ji8464,This is my favourite action movie of all time,10,18 June 2003,"This has got to be one of the best movies ever.The one liners just keep coming and coming. Bruce Willis is brilliant as the former secret service agent and Damon Wayans is also great as the washed up football player.The first time I saw this movie the opening scene blew me away, I still think it is one of the best opening scenes you are ever likely to see in a movie.This will never go down as an acting classic but if you like your movies fast paced with some lines that you will quote to your friends for the rest of your lives then this has got to be a must see. If you can't get some enjoyment and escapism out of this then your taking life too seriously and then some.",The Last Boy Scout

137,Dubs,Bumbled and jumbled,5,29 August 1999,"I knew the movie was going to be a pulpy action flick, but still didn't think ""The Last Boy Scout"" was going to be such a mess of rough-around-the-edges action scenes and a continuous stream of throwaway dialogue. Granted, its not ALL bad--there are some redeeming funny parts and Wayans and Willis play well off of each other. But the plot? It needs more football, less murky conspiracies that don't make sense. And who thought up the idea of that 13 year old girl? She might be the most unnecessary character ever in a movie. ""Last Boy Scout"" was good for a few laughs and a little bit of entertainment, but I was surprised it was directed by Tony Scott, who also did ""Crimson Tide"" and ""Enemy of the State."" In both you had to think...The only thinking I had to do tonight was to try to decide what the best and worst parts of the movie were. The worst was probably when Bruce Willis started blasting away with a dog puppet on his hand...actually, that may have been the best scene too.",The Last Boy Scout
138,Homer-43,Bruce Willis' Best,8,14 April 1999,"I think it was Bruce Willis' best movie (besides 'Pulp Fiction' which doesn't really count as a Bruce Willis movie). I liked 'The Last Boy Scout' movie more than any of the Die Hard Trilogy. The supporting actors are very good, too. I can hardly recommend this movie if you like Bruce Willis",The Last Boy Scout
139,LukeS,"A genre classic - oft copied, never matched",8,7 May 1999,"Although this film receives a lot of credit for reinvigorating the action/buddy genre movie, the praise is too often misdirected.  For instance, whilst Bruce Willis gives a solid performance as low-life private eye Joe Hallenbeck, we have seen the act a dozen times.  There are remnants of Die Hard's John McClane in every knowing smirk and pained cigarette inhalation.  Equally, Tony Scott's direction is still based on an obsession with placing bright lights behind the actors and turning up the volume of car chases and gunshots.  Jimmy Dix, the faded football hero, is given a suitably comic persona by Damon Wayons and the action sequences are as good as you will find elsewhere in Hollywood.  However, these are not the attractions of the film for me.You might think, from what is written above, that I disliked the film but you would be mistaken to think that as I believe it to be an absolute classic of its kind.  I truly think The Last Boy Scout should be used as a teaching tool at film schools the world over.  In spite of its glaring limitations it is a movie that has everything!  The opening scene is a modern movie classic - up there with those of Raiders Of The Lost Ark and Goodfellas.  If there is a film-goer alive whose mouth didn't gape in wonderous amusement at the climax to the opening scene then I am amazed. The plot, as far fetched as it is, provides a perfect vehicle for the key elements that go towards making this the gem of a movie that it is.First in the list of key elements is the wonderfully funny dialogue. Shane Black's hallmark of snappy one-liners is all over the sizzling repartee between the two heroes.  Even Hallenbeck's daughter gets a couple of laugh-out-loud lines.  Secondly, the story benefits from the ideal combination of: sport, gambling, violence, comedy, the odd topless dancer, important values of family and friendship, revenge and honour.  Take out the topless dancer and they pretty much all feature in The Godfather!The third crucial component for the success of The Last Boy Scout is the perfect casting of the bad guys.  Milo, played to chilling perfection by Taylor Negron, is a bad guy with a difference.  He isn't just a mindless hard man.  His brilliantly annoying habit of calling people by their elongated names is a superb touch (Joe becomes Joseph, Jimmy becomes James and so on), as are his attempts at civility when trying to ""do a formal introduction"" with the kidnapped Hallenbeck.  Other bad guys are fleshed out and distinguished by quirky traits or funny lines.  They are not merely there to make the good guys look good.Overall, this film is not a piece of celluloid art.  It is, however, a perfect example of popcorn-friendly entertainment.  It is the sort of movie you imagine the makers would like to see as movie-goers themselves. Without being utterly contemptible or mindlessly low-brow it entertains.  An ideal Saturday night movie to watch with a group of friends.",The Last Boy Scout
140,Bear-77,We've got a great night for football tonight,8,13 April 1999,"Without a doubt one of Willis's best after Die hard I. He plays this former presidential bodyguard who has just reached the low point of his career when he finds out that his best friend is doing his wife. He gets dragged into a sports gambling/bribing case when he agrees to protect a beautiful stripper. He and her boyfriend set out to get the bad guys when the stripper is killed.This movie has the most brutal language I've ever heard in a movie and it adds character to this low PI who hates himself more than anybody who knows him. A really interesting duo and it works, it also has witty one-liners and action galore.If you like action and you don't mind the f*** word you have to take a look at this one because it is ingenious. It would get 3 to 3,5 stars out of four because it's just FUN.",The Last Boy Scout
141,Bigugly,Vulgar but fun,8,9 July 1999,"The Last Boy Scout is one of those films that would not be the same without its off-putting elements, like constant vulgarity, rough violence, and misogyny.  Still, it is a very entertaining action film with a plot more complex than most action films, probably because of the combination of writer Shane Black and director Tony Scott, whose movies make you think a little more.Shane Black's other films (Lethal Weapon, The Long Kiss Goodnight) have a theme similar to The Last Boy Scout:  disgraced detective with low self-worth finds new reasons to enjoy life by the end credits.  This element is a successful one which makes me enjoy watching his movies even more. This, along with Tony Scott's superior visual quality and fine acting from stars Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans, make The Last Boy Scout a winner.",The Last Boy Scout
142,bprokosz,Why I never thought to watch this until today...,4,1 September 2011,"OK, it's been a long time (20 years!) since this film came out...it's also probably the only Bruce Willis action film I hadn't seen and I always wondered why nothing ever really got me interested in it....To be honest, I thought Damon Waynes was the reason...I hate the ""hey lets act like a moron"" comedy so I thought it would be a horrible buddy cop thing...I never actually thought it was a football film.This reminds me of another Willis film I didn't like at all, Last Man Standing...it has a ton of profanity for no purpose other than to have it in an R rated film. This is probably why studios make films pg-13 now. It doesn't make the film any better lets put it that way....2nd it's got over the top shooting and violence that isn't really edited in a way to make it cool...it's just the early 90's close-ups of machine guns and blood splatter and there's really no style or substance to it...its boring.3rd...the plot...it's really trying to be something deep and cool and different from other action movies and it ends up being too convoluted...it's confusing and not in a cool Inception way. Finally the ending (don't worry, no spoilers) feels a lot like other Willis movies where the hidden gun and all the sarcastic humor come into play surrounded by bad guys...this type of thing works in Die Hard when there's 2 people and 1 guy isn't paying attention but this has maybe 8 and one has a shotgun pointed point blank at his chest and is the 3rd person to get shot...idkHonestly with 10 minutes to go I just turned it off...the best part in the entire movie is Halle Berry as a stripper but I don't even know if it was actually her or a body double...either way, I know now why I never bothered to watch this...it's horrible...for a Shane Blake written movie see Lethal Weapon or Kiss,Kiss,Bang,Bang...for a good Willis...um, well you know his stuff by now, close your eyes and pick one.",The Last Boy Scout

This is not an Oscar worthy film by any stretch of the imagination, but it is not a bad way to spend an hour and a half.",The Last Boy Scout
144,viva-6,If I were Roman Catholic...,9,19 June 2000,"...I'd go to confession after watching this. This movie gives new meaning to the term ""guilty pleasure"". But what a pleasure!!!Bruce Willis is at his washed-out, ""I hate myself"", wittiest best and has great chemistry with Damon Wayans. The movie is fast-paced, has great, gritty action and hilarious moments. It is the perfect antidote to those artificial, ""good-looking"" actioners such as the Mission Impossible series. 
However, it may offend certain viewers, particularly women, due to the somewhat misogynous undercurrent. Which is why, out of loyalty to my gender, I have deducted one mark. I could only manage one, though. Thus, 9/10 on my ""finger-scale.""A WARNING: Do not watch this movie if you are trying to quit smoking or have recently quit. Trust me, I know!!",The Last Boy Scout

Everyone loved Bruce Willis (who almost always plays the same type of character)in the Die Hard series. Well, essentially he's back in this film about a disenfranchised former Secret Service agent. Even though his slovenly life style demonstrates his reaction of disillusionment at being railroaded out of his prestigious government job, by a corrupt public official, he maintains his idealistic morals resembling those taught by the Boy Scouts.

First, we aren't connoisseurs of the action flick and maybe it's too uneven to please people who really dote on the genre. There are a couple of places where the plot is advanced without much pretext other than the need to cut to an exciting bit of action. And there are a couple of action scenes that a good editor would simply have cut.But Willis and Wayans give energetic and nicely tuned performances. Chelsea Field is just perfect in a limited role as the detective's wife. The villains are far better drawn than the usual bunch of lazy thugs. And Danielle Harris steals the show as Darian Hallenbeck, the feisty and foul-mouthed 13 year old daughter. She grows during the film with barely an effort  by either writer or actor. A part written with great comic creativity. Really the best thing about a film that has a lot of imaginative lines and action moments.And there are lots of places in this film where the writers give us lines that are head and shoulders above typical film dialog  and way, way beyond the norm for most action movies.

A Brucie bonus!!,7,2 September 2007,"The Last Boy Scout is a violent, adrenaline-charged action thriller helmed by 'Top Gun' director Tony Scott and penned by Shane Black of 'Lethal Weapon' fame. Its throwaway entertainment really, but its non-stop action and snappy one-liners make great viewing. Bruce Willis plays Joe Hallenbeck, a scruffy private detective who is given a job to protect an exotic dancer played by a young Halle Berry. She is girlfriend to a disgraced ex-pro football player, Jimmy Dix (Damon Wayans), who takes an instant dislike to Hallenbeck. Their first conversation in the strip club gives way to some brilliant dialogue, and the delivery of it from the two actors is spot-on. It eventually grows into a buddy-buddy action pic after they get into various scrapes together, while the story unravels into a massive sports gambling scenario involving senators and football team owners. I can't be too specific without giving too much away, but its definitely worth seeing.

JANE.]This film is immediately hamstrung by the script's total lack of originality in dealing with elements as diverse as pro football, political corruption and teenaged delinquents.Scott's uneven and ultimately heavy-handed direction of the mish-mash also shows that his brother's command of visual style and storytelling complexity definitely doesn't run in the family.",The Last Boy Scout

""One of the most underrated films and performances of all time"". Why?... It's not a poorly reviewed film. It made a decent amount of money at the box office. What's so great about it? Three answers: 1)Bruce Willis 2)Dialog 3)Shane Black's Hard Boiled Screenplay. In 1991 the world was somewhat (greatly) different than that of the 1940's world... therefore the movie world was different as well. But in 1991 Shane Black created a screenplay that summoned the 1940's detective story. Unfortunely, many short-sighted critics only saw it as a formulaic action film (not realizing it was a hard boiled film noir detective story ""disguised"" as a buddy action flick to fit into the Hollywood mold of the era. Bruce Willis is the perfect updated version of Humphrey Bogart from ""The Big Sleep"" and ""The Maltese Falcon""... some film freaks may consider that to be sacrilege... but anybody would be hard pressed to find another modern actor who can play the same type of roles as Bogart with the ability and presence of Willis. The dialog in this film is more profane (yet more realistic) but just as clever as the dialog in those 1940's pictures. Favorite quips: ""Spilled my warm cup of p*ss""; Hallenbeck:""I believe in love... I believe in cancer"" Jimmy: ""What? They're both diseases?"" Hallenbeck: ""Something like that""; Favorite Scene: ""Touch me again and I'll kill ya"". I can't recommend this movie enough... Watch ""The Big Sleep"", ""The Maltese Falcon"", and ""The Last Boy Scout"" as a triple feature (and look past the 1990's action elements to compare it to the latter two films)... followed by Shane Black's equally excellent ""Kiss Kiss Bang Bang"" if you want to make it a marathon.",The Last Boy Scout

It's such a surprise to me to read the trivia that the two main starts didn't get along, because there has rarely been a duo on screen with as much chemistry as Willis & Wayans. This winning formula is due to their presence, but also due to Shane Black's cool as can be script, you can see why so much was paid for it off the back of his work for Lethal Weapon. It's also surprising to read that the original idea for the film was so different and at the makers didn't like the finished film, because the tone and pace of the film is pretty perfect, marry this with the witty sharp script it is a joy from start to finish!

The movie starts with the rocky (and cheesy) theme ""Friday Night is A Great Night For Football"" sung by Bill Medley. You can't top that way to begin a movie. But then Scott surprises us again. the opening sequence, where a football player is going to use any way possible to score a touchdown, is breath taking too. Enter Joe Hallenback (Willis) and Jimmy Dix (Wayans) two fallen heroes. One, a detective, the other an ex pro of the Stallion's league. The mob is there too, gamble, money, bets, a murdered young girl and big explosions. All of this wrapped up in a great story, which I won't spoil. This film is one of Tarantino's favorites. It's full of one liners and classic scenes. Violent and graphic. ""Touch me again and I kill you..."" says Willis' character to one of the gangsters. You should see the result. Written by Shane Black (Lethal Weapon) you've got a guarantee you're going to have a great time.

It is one of my favourite actioners of the 90's, mainly due to the script. Most action movies that also attempt to be funny fall flat on their cheesy, one linered faces. But some of the jokes here (if you're watching an uncut version) actually produce a smile because they are funny. In fact some are downright rib-tickling, just watch the the car-boot explosive scene again if you don't believe me. The unexpected pairing of Willis and Wayans works amazingly well, with some of the greatest one-liners in history (controversial) from Willis. Makes you wonder why the goddam, pencil pushing suits down at city hall (Hollywood) haven't made a load of cynically exploitative vehicles for the comedy duo. For once the excessive swearing adds to the comedy value, although be warned there are a great many. Nice one Shane.",The Last Boy Scout
161,lloydchristmas08,One of the best guy movies ever,8,6 October 2001,"this is one of my favorite bruce willis movies.  He has so many great one-liners  in this.  Its like a 4th installment of the die hard series in my opinon.  The plot might be a little far fetched but i say just sit back and enjoy the ride, great action scenes and perfect casting.  The bad guys are great and Willis and Waynes make a really good tag team of smart ass remarks.  And the ending is halarious when they are at the final fight scene.  Don't take this movie too seriously and you'll have a great time watching this.",The Last Boy Scout
162,frederick-jon,Chinatown with Jokes???,9,15 January 2003,"OK, the one line summary may be going to far! - but The Last Boy Scout, very loosely, is similar (in parts of story) to Roman Polanski's Chinatown. There are small consistencies between the two and I would make an educated guess that the screenwriters used Chinatown (a brilliant movie) as the basis of this story! Our main character, the scum-bag detective just trying to make a living, even takes a similar name of a LA bridge used in Chinatown - Hallenbeck/HollenbeckHowever, the Last Boy Scout is a breath of fresh air in the genre of action films. I would never argue that it's strays from the stereo-typical action movie plot, big explosions, twisted evil bad guys and of course the good guys winning in the grand finale, but in Last Boy Scout the partnership between Willis (who I am no fan of) and Wayans gives the film a truly healthy chemistry and atmosphere.It looks like that both our screen hero's enjoyed making this film and transported the classic one liner humour, we have the pleasure of seeing on screen, off screen also.The first time I watched this movie, I didn't enjoy it! Then (after a friend recommended) on second viewing, I started to see the fun in the movie. The performances aren't great, but neither are they bad. At the end of the day Willis was typically Willis for that period of his acting career!The enjoyment for me is the one liners and story that's gels all the humour together, this is one of the funniest films I have seen in terms of one lines. ""....we're being beaten up by the inventor of scrabble""The direction from Tony Scott is no less than what you expect to see in one of his films and the performances of, the annoying little brat Darian, played by Danielle Harris and bad guy Milo, add enjoyable ingredients to the film.There are plot holes aplenty and the purest will rate this at below par, but on the surface its an enjoyable action film with bags of humour.",The Last Boy Scout
163,TexasMovieBuff,they don't make action movies like this anymore...,9,10 December 2004,"In the early 90's, there was a definite, consistent presence in action movies: slow motion cinematography, wild gun-play, and funny one-liners. Granted, there are still some of those today (2004), but it just wasn't the same as back in the day. Now there are so many special effects in the current action films that it drowns out what used to be the great style of a ""popcorn flick"".Die Hard paved the way for these type of movies, and some of the offspring of this did well and did not. The Last Boyscout was one that did well. This was a very intelligent and fun action/thriller/buddy-comedy that can still be enjoyed to this day. Tony Scott is the master of under-appreciated action movies in the 90's, such as this and True Romance. My suggestion is to get a 6-pack, go rent this movie, sit back and enjoy the ride.",The Last Boy Scout
164,wilfredsagen,One of the best in its field!,9,24 March 2005,"Before commenting on the movie itself I would like to explain my position on ""judging"" movies (since I'm a newbie here). Namely - IMHO, one has to analyze the ""how"", not the ""what"". Meaning - if you, for instance, compare this movie to a, for example, Pasolini / Bertolucci / Tarkovski / Whoever-else, you won't get far. There's no way to choose between a melon and a steak - one is a main course, another is dessert. Now then, all I gotta say on the actual movie is: an excellent specie of a purely commercial entertainment for grown-ups with a lot of kid stuff inside. The advantages and limitations of the genre - which is your typical action with a twist of comedy - are played on beautifully by the great action hero (who, IMHO, is also much more than that) Bruce Willis with his usual charisma and self-irony. Damon Wanes gives a very decent, even if a bit ""afroamerican-comedy-club stereotype"" performance, every note is in it's rightful place, though he is not as yet the actor we know from ""Bamboozled"". Danielle Harris is easy-going, natural and convincing as a teen daughter of the Last Boyscout. Chelsea Field is a bit shallow in this, your standard ""wife"". I think the role needed more ""soulsearching"". Taylor Negrin was too ""cartoony"" for my taste, a bit over the top, so didn't affect me as scary, which was obviously intended. The screenplay is fast, alive and has a good balance of drama/comedy, without rubbing our faces in either. Tony Scott keeps it interesting with his very own and unique visual style. On the whole - a highly enjoyable quality entertainment. WATCH IT - HAVE FUN!",The Last Boy Scout
165,Braveheart-3,A movie that has it all,10,10 April 2000,"There are so many action comedy films out there, so how can you be certain you have a good one ? Simple - choose this one ! It has everything. Bruce Willis at his ""Die Hard attitude"" best and supported wonderfully by Damon Wayans who just eats up the screen and warms to the audience with his ebullient personality and cutting one-liners. This film is a must for all - not just the Lethal Weaponites !!",The Last Boy Scout
166,jonathanrutledge,great action Saturday night film,9,8 April 2011,"One of my favorite films. Tony Scott has directed a classic action buddy film. Bruce Willis is great as the down and out private eye (in the John McClane style), teaming up with Damon Wayons an ex-football star to solve a murder case. There is action from start to finish with car chases, explosions, great baddies, and lots of shooting, which lead up to a suitably climactic ending.The witty script and fantastic one liners lift this film above others. The cutting repartee between Willis and Wayons together with the sarcastic relationship between Willis (Hallenbeck) and his daughter are very funny.If you like a film to deliver action, good acting and plenty of laughs then this is a must see.",The Last Boy Scout
167,scorpius-4,Best Movie Ever !!!,10,12 April 2005,"Yeah it's true, this movie is the one I like most of all I've ever seen in my life (and believe me, I've seen a lot of movies). No minute passes without a cool saying of Bruce or something been blown up. It's the kind of movie where you can't run away to toilet because you know something is going to happen the next second. Bruce Willis plays the perfectly cynical Joe Hallenbeck who has to investigate the murder of Jimi Dix' (Damon Wayans) girlfriend. But the motive reaches up to an influential politician and the owner of a football team.Actually the plot isn't really important in this movie, it's rather the cool appearance of Joe Hallenbeck, whose sayings are extremely funny, and Jimi who tries to be like Joe. I read somewhere that it is the movie with the most sayings, on which I can only agree. It is like ""The Rock"" or ""Die Hard"", only better. If you liked those you will love ""The Last Boy Scout"". If you've never watched it: Shame on you!! Go get it at the local video store! (but watch out for the uncut version, because else you miss the best scene)",The Last Boy Scout
168,travisraysims,"""I'm thinking about smokin some cigarettes.""",9,18 July 2007,"Where do you begin with a movie like The Last Boyscout? I was a teenager when this movie came out, actually the same age as Danielle Harris. This movie is great. Sure it's not an intellectual movie, but who cares. It is what it is. I remember using the massive amount of one liners at school. This movie delivers them in droves. The movie shows the redemption of a down-on-his-luck detective. Many complain of it being anti-woman, but I see a man still in love with his wife and forgives her at the end. Many don't understand what he says to her at the end of the movie, but they weren't paying attention at the beginning to get the point. Great action, lots of bullets, lots of brutality, and lots of comedy. I believe this to be one of Bruce Willis' best movies. They just don't make em like this anymore, well maybe they try but can't get it right. Having Joe kill a man by punching his nose into his brain, and then casually pick up a cigarette and sit down and smoke it has to be one of the best scenes, i've ever seen. Do yourself a favor and treat yourself to this action classic, you won't be disappointed.",The Last Boy Scout
