0,SnoopyStyle,sincere teen rom-com,8,16 March 2015,"It's graduation at a Seattle high school. Lloyd Dobler (John Cusack) vows to go out with Diane Court (Ione Skye). His friends Corey Flood (Lili Taylor) explain to Lloyd that she's a brain and they won't fit. He's living with his single mom sister Constance (Joan Cusack). She's the valedictorian on her way to England with a hard won scholarship. Her only friend is her father Jim (John Mahoney) who owns a nursing home. She regrets being detached from her schoolmates and is intrigued with Lloyd. Her father disapproves of Lloyd and the slacker distraction he represents.This is one of the most sincere of the teen rom-com genre. It's more than the iconic boombox scene. John Cusack seems perfectly fitted to play this charming nice guy. He has great friends and he's a perfect gentleman. He's like a prince charming and it's completely believable that Diane would fall heavily for Lloyd. Written and directed by Cameron Crowe, this movie takes the genre seriously which often easily falls into broad slacker comedy.",Say Anything
1,claudio_carvalho,Overrated Romantic-Comedy,5,15 October 2018,"The unambitious teenager Lloyd Dobler (John Cusack) has a crush on the gorgeous bookworm Diane Court (Ione Skye) and decides to invite her to date him in the high-school graduation party and she accepts. Lloyd is living with his sister Constance and has no plan for his future. The objective Diane lives with her father James Court (John Mahoney), who is the owner of a retirement home, and has just received a scholarship from a British college. Soon they fall in love with each other but James is investigated by the IRS agents and convinces Diane to break up with Lloyd and travel to England. 'Say Anything..."" is an overrated romantic-comedy, with a reasonable romance. The subplot with Lily Taylor is silly and forgotten. The unethical situation of James Court is shallow. However, the music score is fantastic and worthwhile listening. My vote is five.Title (Brazil): ""Digam o que Quiserem"" (""Say What Want"")",Say Anything
2,classicsoncall,"""I'm looking for a dare-to-be-great situation.""",7,31 May 2018,"I'm not big on teenage angst films because those years are way behind me now. But this picture surprised me in that it seemed more realistic and credible than a lot of stories that feature flashy characters and over the top situations. Lloyd Dobler (John Cusack) and Diane Court (Ione Skye) were fairly straight, normal looking high school graduates whose career paths might have gone in entirely different directions if Lloyd hadn't summoned up the courage to ask her out on a date. The story points out the varying misperceptions high school students harbor about others who aren't like them, and it was commendable how the all-night party gave Diane an opportunity to feel welcomed by students she otherwise might not even known had existed. There was a rather unforced error in the script though regarding Diane's winning the Reed Scholarship. Her father (John Mahoney) learned about it via a phone call, and rushed over to the nursing home to tell her about it. However later on, when Lloyd spoke to her on the phone to congratulate her, he said he read about it in the newspaper. That seemed like a pretty big goof to go unnoticed by the film makers.Anyway, as far as romantic comedies go, this was more than tolerable. Not being part of the target audience, I didn't feel embarrassed by the picture the way one gets watching a picture like ""There's Something About Mary"" for example. One might even go so far as to call this a teen flick for grown-ups.",Say Anything
3,lee_eisenberg,"you had me at ""say""...",7,19 May 2006,"In one of the many '80s teen movies, Seattle teens Lloyd Dobler (John Cusack) and Diane Court (Ione Skye) fall in love the summer before she goes off to college. Although ""Say Anything..."" isn't any kind of great movie, Cameron Crowe brings the same interesting aspect to everything that he brought to ""Jerry Maguire"". If nothing else, the movie is a look at Seattle. Still, I wonder just how many movies about relationships there can be (obviously, so many that a few years ago, we had ""Not Another Teen Movie""). But either way, this is worth seeing. Also starring Lili Taylor and Jason Gould.""NEVER, EVER, EVER."" Hmm...",Say Anything
4,jboothmillard,Say Anything...,6,12 October 2010,"From writer/director Cameron Crowe (Fast Times at Ridgemont High, Jerry Maguire), I watched this film simply for being in the book 1001 Movies You Must See Before You Die, but I wanted to like it too. Basically after their graduation from their Seattle, Washington high school, mediocre student and aspiring kick-boxer Lloyd Dobler (John Cusack) tries to start a relationship with Diane Court (Ione Skye). She agrees to a date with him, going to a big graduation party, but he is unaware that she won a major fellowship to study in England, and she will be going at the end of summer. After this date Lloyd and Diane see each other more regularly, and to make sure the relationship works Lloyd gets advise from his sister Constance (Joan Cusack) and Diane's friends. Diane's father James (John Mahoney) has landed himself in trouble for tax violations at his nursing home Diane works at, so the IRS, run by boss (Philip Baker Hall), are on to him. Diane is worried she is not spending more time with Lloyd and not enough with her father, and James obviously doesn't approve of the dating. So Diane makes a pressured decision, not long after receiving a touching love letter from Lloyd, to end it with him. Diane finds out about her father James's money stealing, and Lloyd wins her back playing a love song on his stereo radio, and they go to England together. Also starring Lili Taylor as Corey Flood, Amy Brooks as D.C., Jason Gould as Mike Cameron, Loren Dean as Joe, Glenn Walker Harris Jr. as Jason Dobler, Jeremy Piven as Mark, Bebe Neuwirth as Mrs. Evans, Eric Stoltz as Vahlere and Dan Castellaneta as Diane's Teacher. Cusack is great as the slacker and charmer for Skye's affections, she meanwhile is nice as the well educated ""Miss Priss"", and Mahoney gets his moments as the concerned and not very honest father. Obviously this is filled with the usual teen movie clichés and predictable moments, but with a good cast likable cast, and a reasonable love story, this is a good fun comedy drama. John Cusack was number 48 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars. Good!",Say Anything
5,rmax304823,Ridgemont High Grows Up.,5,10 May 2012,"Late adolescence Angst. Small-town girl smartie Ione Skye wins a scholarship to an exclusive college in England, much to the delight of her doting father, John Mahoney. Skye herself is thrilled and can hardly wait for the summer to pass.Enter John Cusack, who begins to woo her. (And why not? She's delicious.) She begins to respond to his importunings and finally gives it up in the back seat of his car. Now she finds herself torn between her desire to advance herself while pleasing her father, and her growing attachment to the blunt, candid, but perceptive Cusack.This displeases Mahoney mightily. Cusack lacks enterprise. He's marking time as a kick-boxing instructor until he decides what to do with his life. Mahoney knows all about the affair because she tells him everything. They have a pact that they will always tell each other the truth. This would never work in real life but, okay, this is only a movie. After her father's earnest pleadings she cuts it off with Cusack who can find no solace elsewhere.Then it turns out that the retirement home run by her father is a fraud. He's been milking the clients, stealing their Social Security checks, and I don't know what all -- a terrible guy and a liar. His only justification: ""I took CARE of them!"" Mahoney winds up in the slams and Skye and Cusack take off for England together.It's a not exactly inspiring story of class conflict. It's as if she's a Capulet and he's a Montague, only the Capulets have more money and a brighter future than the Montague. (Low point of the movie: Cusack stands outside Skye's bedroom, apparently all night, holding a boom box above his head playing their favorite song.) Pretty dumb. But it's not nearly as dumb a movie as Cameron Crowe's ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"", which was populated by thirty-year-old high school boys and the only redeeming features of which were Phoebe Cates' ample bosoms.Its values are those of late adolescence rather than post pubescence. There is little in the way of the kind of invented semi-witty slang you find in some movies about school kids. And, while some of the characters have goofy hair, none of them approaches the perpetually stoned Sean Penn in ""Fast Times."" Even so, it does pander. After all, the two lovers are right and the old man is a fraud and pretender. That outcome is the sort that gets them right in the middle of the good old demographic.The acting on the part of all the principles is pretty good. Mahoney in particular does well in a complex role. Ione Skye is beautiful without being stunning and gives the least accomplished performance. John Cusack seems to fit his role more naturally. Worth watching.",Say Anything
6,moonspinner55,"It might have been excruciating, but instead it has a confidently quirky edge...",6,29 January 2006,"I'm not sure to what parts of this material writer-director Cameron Crowe had his heart truly behind: the boy-girl teen romance stuff which constitutes the first part of the picture or the distrust and self-doubt (and self-realization) of the second half. In any case, it's a pretty good film, with John Cusack as a flip, quick-thinking, fast talking teen just out of high school who romances Ione Skye, the attractive, smart girl on her way to college. Skye's character doesn't have the usual facade we see in movies like these, but her disapproving father does, and it plays itself out quite dramatically. Some of Crowe's writing is still a little precious (as in a half-hearted joke dealing with a letter-writing pen) and he's too embarrassingly enamored of rock music as everyone's salvation. The opening moments with Cusack and friends at a party are strung together rather carelessly without much guidance from Crowe (and the affection he has for these lovelorn kids doesn't quite come through), but the movie improves tremendously and becomes a confident examination of two younger people outgrowing their doubts and moving forward together. There's a lot of talk about Ione Skye moving to England and maybe falling for a British guy, which is exactly what happened in her follow-up movie, ""The Rachel Papers"". **1/2 from ****",Say Anything
7,tavm,"After so many years, I finally got to see Say Anything... and I love it!",10,22 July 2013,"After so many years of hearing about this movie, I finally got to watch Say Anything... with my mom just now on a Netflix disc. Part of me expected a comedy on the order of the John Hughes movies or maybe Fast Times at Ridgemont High which happened to have been written by Cameron Crowe, the same one who wrote and directed-for the first time-this one. Instead, I found out this was a drama with some subtle humorous scenes about the budding romance of Lloyd Dobler (John Cusack) and Diane Court (Ione Skye), the former an underachieving high school graduate and the latter the class valedictorian. Oh, and she has a father (John Mahoney) who gave her the best of what life has to offer but turns out to have some flaws that threaten their relationship. That's all I'll mention of the plot. Now I just want to say that I love the whole vibe that went on during the movie. It's such a refreshingly candid romantic movie especially during that iconic scene of Lloyd playing Peter Gabriel's ""In Your Eyes"" on that boom box hoping Diane comes to the window to see him. Nothing more to say except Say Anything... comes highly recommended.",Say Anything
8,edwagreen,Say Anything Says Basically Nothing **,4,16 February 2009,"A very beautiful Ione Skye and a teenage-like John Cusack try to bring life to this rather lackluster 1989 film.Cusack is really a step above the rebel without a cause here. He falls hook, line and sinker for the outstanding graduate Ione Skye.Love does happen between these 2 unlikely candidates. Jack Mahoney is credible as the father who seems to be ever doting on his daughter, so proud of her when she wins a fellowship to study in England and dedicated in serving the people of the nursing home he runs. The man appears to be a saint. Go know that he has been embezzling from those under his care. When this is discovered, the movie takes a turn and I'm afraid it's not for the better.That scene with Mahoney in red suit in jail smoking a cigarette nervously while visited by both teens does not evoke any sentiment whatsoever.",Say Anything
9,michaelRokeefe,What we do for love.,7,3 July 2000,"Cameron Crowe succeeds in creating a vary likeable character dealing with love from afar. Lloyd Dobler, played by John Cusak, is very popular, but without major ambition. He is smitten with the smartest girl in school, played by Ione Skye. Dobler's current main goal in life is to get a date with the object of his obsession. If you liked the movie PRETTY IN PINK, you will really enjoy this movie.

12,preppy-3,Cameron Crowe's best film,8,18 August 2000,"Writer/director Cameron Crowe now makes big-budget by-the-numbers Holloywood films (""Jerry Maguire"").  This is (I believe) his first film and shows how talented he once was.  It's a simple teenage love story between Cusack (great--as always) and Skye (vapid--but OK).  The difference between this and thousands of other films like it is the script and the acting.  The characters sound and act like real people.  Not one line rang false.  Also the film is romantic without being mushy--the scene with Cusack holding the boom box playing a Peter Gabriel song on the outskirts of Skye's house is just beautiful (and unlike anything I've ever seen in a film).  This film wasn't a big box office hit but has gained popularity over the years.  Well worth catching...one of the best films of 1989.  Also it's a treat seeing Joan Cusack (in a rare dramatic role) and John playing what they are--brother and sister.",Say Anything
13,LeonLouisRicci,A Teen Rom-Com That For Once is Approachable and Cringeless,8,9 November 2014,"This is One Smoothie Movie. It Really Goes Down Quite Well. The Characters are Just Above the Surface and Not Embellished or Exaggerated, as So Often Happens in Teen Movies. The Subtle and Sometimes Dark Humor Works, Like the Pen, the Bathtub Scene, and Relationships because it Seems Natural and Not Written.The Performances Across the Board are Also Endearing Because the Characters Seem Real, but are Painted with Just a Slight Touch of Romanticism.

After All isn't this the 1980's.Overall, this is a Smartly Written and Directed Debut Film from Cameron Crowe and was Ignored and Not a Hit in its Initial Release.

16,anaconda-40658,"Say Anything? How About, ""It's Awesome!""",10,3 June 2015,"Say Anything (1989): Dir: Cameron Crowe / Cast: John Cusack, Ione Skye, John Mahoney, Lili Taylor, Joan Cusack: In the dusk of a decade comes one of the best teen romances ever filmed. Cameron Crowe's observant teen portrayals involves honesty and communication. It stars John Cusack as a high school graduate who makes cash teaching kick boxing, and lives with his sister, herself a mother. Ignoring any career prospects, he sets his sights on a brainy valedictorian, played by Ione Skye who is set to fly to England with a scholarship. She is asked out via phone by Cusack, whom she vaguely remembers, but her acceptance leads to a romance, security and freedom she never knew, even during a drunken party. Her parents are divorced and she lives with her father, played by John Mahoney, who runs a nursing home where he is investigated on charges of pocketing the cash of those in his care. The screenplay has funny moments where Cusack expresses himself as he does, but the serious undertones are convicting with solid performances by all three principal actors as well as Lili Taylor as Cusack's love sick friend who once attempted suicide. Now she writes songs about the guy who dumped her. Joan Cusack plays John's sister, which plays in effect as real siblings. Crowe is an expert observer of relationships, both young and old and the bonds that remain even after devastation. Score: 10 / 10",Say Anything
17,Wuchakk,The summer after high school in Seattle in the late 80s,5,23 December 2012,"Ione Skye plays Diane, a misfit ""preppy"" girl who suddenly comes alive upon graduation after striking up a relationship with Lloyd Dobler, played by John Cusack. Diane has a scholarship to a prestigious college in England and her Dad, played by John Mahoney, doesn't want some aimless kickboxer getting in the way of her success. Joan Cusack fittingly plays Lloyd's sister while the alluring Bebe Neuwirth shows up for a cameo as his teacher.""Say Anything"" (1989) is a coming-of-age drama/romance praised by critics and has loads of fans.I agree to some degree: The situations and relationships smack of real life and you can tell that writer/director Cameron Crowe and the cast put time & effort into creating this ""reality."" For instance, two of Lloyd's best friends are girls, Corey and D. C., who try to advise him on his new relationship. Another example is Diane's honest relationship with her dad. The first half is filled with quality scenes, like Corey playing her guitar at a party, still venting emotions regarding a past flame. Plus unlike, say, ""Porky's"" and ""American Pie"" there's thankfully no juvenile raunch. In other words, ""Say Anything"" is a classy teen-college flick.Yet I'm not a big fan of Cusack and Crowe apparently doesn't know how to lens beautiful women, like Skye (and I'm not talking 'bout nudity or sleaze). Meanwhile the second half isn't as entertaining as the first because it leaves the high school graduation antics behind to focus on Diane and Lloyd's increasingly intimate relationship, as well as unexpected revelations about Diane's father. Those who like stories about romantic relationships will no doubt appreciate the second half more than me.It's decent and I respect it, but Crowe did far superior work with ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" (1982) and ""Jerry Maguire"" (1996).The film runs 1 hour, 40 minutes, and was shot in Seattle; Kitsilano Beach, Vancouver (the graduation scene); Los Angeles and North Hollywood (the boom box scene).GRADE: C+",Say Anything
18,The_Void,Not really that good,6,27 January 2005,"I'm something of a fan of breezy romantic comedies, and I rate John Cusack highly as an actor with the ability to carry a film (something that he does in many of his films). I was therefore very much on course to find a new favourite in this product of the 80's, but unfortunately I didn't. This film sees John Cusack before he gained the abilities as an actor that would later go on to make him a much-loved presence. His performance, though not bad, isn't what later films would prove him capable of. The film itself is soaked in a sentiment that feels like it's trying to be warm and friendly, but it never quite captures that which Cameron Crowe so obviously wanted it to be. Crowe appears to have a fascination with teenage coming of age tales, which he showed with his earlier 'Fast Times at Ridgemount High', and the later 'Almost Famous', and though those films worked rather well; this one doesn't. It gets irritating quickly and by the hour mark you'll no doubt be begging for the credits.Cusack plays typical high school graduate, Lloyd Dobler. Dobler is a young man that hasn't yet decided what he wants from life. Other than a date with fellow graduate, Diane Court. It is the characters that are the best thing about this film; the central character especially is very well observed, and most people that have been through high school will most probably see something of themselves in him. John Mahoney plays the loving father of Cusack's crush, and delivers a fine performance with it. Again, many people will be able to see something of their own father in him (though hopefully not too much!), and this character is another example of Crowe's triumph with creating characters. He doesn't follow up on this with the character of Diane. As she's a main character, you would expect her to be well done, but she isn't and that is some of the reason why the film falls down. Rather than giving her a believable and interesting character, Crowe has decided to pretty much give her no character, and the performance by Ione Skye doesn't exactly help matters either.Say Anything certainly isn't all bad. Fans of this sort of film will find lots to like about it, it's just a shame that Crowe wasn't able to deliver a good film with the premise.

21,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: (DVD) Say Anything (1989),8,20 January 2006,"It's weird, but it has happened. I've been subconsciously borrowing DVDs which has John Cusack starring in them, and this time, it's John Cusack together with one of my favorite storytellers (storyteller, cos he wrote and directed his own films) Cameron Crowe, in Crowe's directorial debut with Say Anything.From this early work, you can't help but notice the foundations laid for Crowe's later works, with the loads of music incorporated and some moving the narrative forward, and the enjoyable characters he creates - some seem so ordinary, yet so real and special, the idiosyncrasies that have, the quirky situations they're put in, the character development.Ordinary, identifiable characters have become hallmarks, and in this film, it is no different. Perhaps what made this simple story endear itself, is the chameleon John Cusack. Here, he plays average joe Lloyd Dobler, who has just graduated from high school, but has no big plans for himself in the aftermath. He's at a lost at what to do, but had stunned his cohort by dating the school sweetheart, and the brainiest scholar at that. That unattainable beauty with brains, Diane Court (Ioan Skye), the object of every schmuck's desire.But then you have her overprotective father who objects to their relationship (don't they always?) and a looming corporate scandal (like NKF's) which questions morality between two different camps of thought. The bigger picture might already seem familiar given that the boy-meets-girl-love-breakup-reconciliation theme has been done to death, but what appeals is the really witty dialogue amongst characters, despite some stuff looking out of date (hey, it's a 1989 movie after all).The Special Edition Code 1 DVD comes with so many extras, check this - 13 extended scenes (those shortened to speed up the pace, so it's included here instead), 10 deleted scenes (those that didn't make the final cut, which explained in more detail certain subplots like the corporate scandal cum investigation), and 5 alternate scenes. There's also an audio commentary by Crowe, Cusack and Skye, as well as the theatrical trailers.",Say Anything
22,SimonJack,Coming of age film with some twists,6,19 December 2016,"""Say Anything"" is a coming of age film of the late 1980s with a couple of twists. It's billed as a comedy, drama and romance, but the amount of comedy hardly qualifies it for that It's a coming of age drama and romance. Both of the lead characters come from broken homes. John Cusack is Lloyd Dobler who doesn't have any particular plans for a future. Ione Skye is Diane Court who has just won a cherished fellowship to study in England. The story takes place over the summer after high school graduation. It takes place in California somewhere along the coast.Besides the twist of different educational outlooks of the two leads, Diane's father will soon go to prison for fraud. The IRS case is solid against him. This movie is different from the usual high school films of the mid to late 20th century that focused on rebellious teens or the raucous and crass behavior of cliques. The language is clean, and there isn't any vandalism, violence or mayhem. We know early on that it will be a romance between two young people who are near opposites. The plot is okay but seems disjointed at times. The story is somewhat slow going. The acting of the principals is good, not so much so for some of the younger supporting cast. Cusack had a dozen movies behind him by the time of this film and was 23 years old. Still, he looked high school age. Skye, on the other hand, was new to filmdom with only three films ahead of this one. And, she was right on the age – 18. She even shows a little of a teen face that had some skin problems that are common around that age. It's a credit to the studio that it didn't try to cover this up with makeup. The ending is a little far-fetched. The only bit of comedy that stood out was a line uttered by a girl in a discussion with Lloyd and another girl. She was referring to Diane when she said, ""She's a brain with a body of game show hostess.""Watching this film just now in my senior years, for the first time it struck me that movies about teenagers are no longer very interesting or entertaining to me. Perhaps a younger audience would enjoy it more.",Say Anything
23,StevePulaski,"Don't you want me, baby?",8,19 August 2011,"If you would've told one of your high school buddies that Say Anything would become a classic film in 1989 you probably would've gotten an eye-roll or a good laugh. But truthfully, it wasn't uncommon for an eighties film to do moderately successful at the box office, then become a classic in later years. You'd call that a ""cult classic,"" a film cherished by a specific group of people, but I don't think Say Anything would fit in that category. It's cherished by pretty much everyone who saw it, and I think that's larger than a cult.Our lead male is Lloyd (Cusack), an aspiring kickboxer who has just graduated high school and hopes to date valedictorian Diane (Skye). Lloyd calls Diane's house, gets her stern, overprotective father (Mahoney) on the phone, and manages to sort of charm him in a strange way.Lloyd is persistent when he finally talks to Diane, and finally encourages her to go to a party with him. They continue to see each other, much to the father's dismay. Diane likes Lloyd because he's able to see the other side of her. Not just the brainy side, but the honest, beautiful side of her.The subplots involve the struggle to maintain a healthy relationship and embrace the future since Diane is moving to England for College, and the fact the father is accused of tax violations at the nursing home he owns.The story is overall beautiful, touching, and many other things. Especially because it's honest and believable. This was made back in time when romantic comedies weren't cliché stories, but had a script, a cast, and a heart. It all works here because it wants to. It wants to make a good film, and does.Even though Cameron Crowe directed this gem, I had vague images of John Hughes's name being on this film. Maybe because since he was known for every fantastic teen comedy of the eighties, he'd be a name to look for on everyone.

24,Smells_Like_Cheese,Awwwwwwww!,10,31 October 2005,"If you have read my ""Sixteen Candles"" comment, I have been on a journey to watch all of the classic teen 80's movies. The girls at my work have been on my case with this, so now I have seen ""Pretty in Pink"", ""The Breakfast Club"", and ""Sixteen Candles"", now ""Say Anything..."". When I told one of the girls I rented this movie, she was excited. She said this is one of the best teen movies of the 80's, and I'd have to agree.It's not a real sappy love story, it's more normal and real. It has it doubt's, flaws, scary parts, fun parts, sexy parts, and the friendship. Ione and John clicked so well in this movie. I loved the scene where John is standing outside with the stereo blasting ""In your eyes"" by Peter Gabriel. What a fantastic scene, I mean what girl wouldn't like that? And poor John was only like 90 pounds, I was hoping Ione would have run to him to let him put that 1000 pound stereo down! It was the 80's, there was nothing smaller. :D This is a great movie. I think it should be watched by anyone. It's just a fun film to watch with friends or a date. So far, this is my favorite 80's teen flick.10/10",Say Anything

28,ThomasDrufke,Friends With Potential,7,23 May 2015,"Cameron Crowe is one of those directors that is incredibly gifted at writing great characters that feel like they are having real relationships. Whether it be parents to children, unlikely friendships, or just great romance, Crowe always finds a way to get the best out of actors and that always starts with his scripts. Say Anything tells the story of Lloyd, a well mannered 19 year old who lives in the now, and Diane, a valedictorian with everything good coming her way, and how a relationship like that may blossom over the course of the summer before college.Some may shrug at the fact that Lloyd may have no business in being with a girl of her stature, but the film does a nice job of making the romance believable. Having not known each other in high school, Lloyd decides to take his chances and just call and ask her on a date. Of course, she's very hesitant at first but by simply saying ""he made me laugh"" was enough for me. It's true, a laugh can go a long way in getting to know something in whatever aspect possible. Now 26 years later you can definitely feel the influence that this film had on coming of age films even to this day. The Spectacular Now takes a similar premise and also was very successful. It's hard to nail a high school film, but Say Anything did a pretty good job. I also appreciated the way they portrayed Diane's relationship with her father. It was clearly a close bond they had, and for 3/4 of the movie I felt like it wasn't clichéd at all. There wasn't the typical Disney moments of ""it's my dream dad, not yours"". Now, towards the end of the film I think that same relationship was sacrificed for certain plot points. Knowing that the film isn't all that unpredictable, I should have guessed certain things would happen, but I felt like the last third of the movie felt too much like all the other Hollywood films.There are a lot of classic Crowe moments like when Lloyd is constantly getting advice from his close girlfriends or even his guy friends, so there's no shortage of laughs or fun moments. The film also contains a fantastic score and soundtrack, which are also Crowe trademarks. The famous boombox scene is shorter than I thought and doesn't hold as much of a bearing on the film's outcome as I had heard. But Say Anything is still a well done coming of age film with real characters with real moments.+Soundtrack/score +Real romance +Everyone is well written +Felt like I was living it with them -3rd acts left turn 7.7/10",Say Anything

30,atlasmb,"An Okay Teen Film, But Uninspiring",7,24 July 2014,"I did not see this film during its first release, but I have heard it referenced many times, especially regarding the iconic scene where Lloyd Dobler (John Cusack) holds the boom box over his head.After watching it, I have to say I am underwhelmed. It's a nice film, but certainly not a significant film or a very memorable film. After analyzing it, I think I know the main reason why.Lloyd is infatuated with, and then falls in love with, Diane Court (Ione Skye). For this film to work well, the viewer has to feel that this love is memorable, if not amazing. Lloyd is a nice guy. He has little ambition. But he has this idea that it would be a dream come true if he could get the beautiful, intelligent Diane to go out with him.Diane, as the object of Lloyd's obsession, has to be worthy of that obsession. And this is where the film falls short for me. She is a nice girl. A ""good"" girl. A dutiful daughter, academically successful in high school, blah blah blah plain vanilla. I don't see how she justifiably inspires the passion that Lloyd feels for her. Why not? Because she displays little passion herself.Think about it. She has some big issues to contend with. Her valedictorian speech. Life after school (that she is ""afraid"" of). Going away to college. A future career. But do we hear her talk passionately about any of them? She is rather docile and meek.When it comes to her feelings for Lloyd, that is where the passion should be apparent. Maybe she was intentionally underplaying it, but the first time she admits she loves Lloyd it is almost an aside, a throw-away line. And he calls her on it. Later, a montage of kissing scenes shows us that they are getting more involved. But do we ever see her proclaim her love the way Lloyd does with the boom box? Speaking of the boom box scene, it is an iconic image, but it falls flat within the story. It starts to sizzle, but fizzles.I can see how this film might appeal more to women. Lloyd is a nice guy they can feel something for. Some guys probably look up to Lloyd as a guy who goes after what he wants. But I feel the object of his desires should be an amazing girl, not just a nice girl.The message boards contain some differences of opinion on this topic. It is a matter of personal opinion, based upon one's personal outlook.The film does a good job of veering from the fairytale path that some teen romances take. And it has a wonderful cast, filled with interesting appearances--like Bebe Neuwirth in her film debut. Unfortunately, it feels like the rest of her performance hit the cutting room floor.This film is okay, but for me it does not evoke universal feelings like most films by John Hughes.",Say Anything

32,johnnyboyz,"An honest, thoughtful and pleasing observation on teenaged angst and coming of age, as two disparates forge a bond around a world beginning to become fraught with change.",7,8 May 2011,"Say Anything... (complete with, count 'em, three periods) begins in a teenager's bedroom as they sit there with two of their closest companions, at that stage in a conversation during which the knocking back and forth of ideas threatens to escalate into arguing. The disagreements are over words, or more specifically, words that define what it is certain actions of a romantic nature ought be labelled – there is enough pressure in these people's lives, it seems, when it comes to one's peers; maintaining reputations and the overbearing issue of studies to have to worry about without getting your words and terms right when speaking openly to high school chums. It is the first instance in Cameron Crowe's delightful little teenaged-young adult comedy during which we observe youngsters confused, bewildered and in angst over romance or items more broadly linked to romance. What the film eventually comes to do is branch out into a charming piece about a young man's feelings for another girl, as the clock ticks down to her leaving and a proverbial net of all things pressurised and unenviable appear to close in.That young man is Lloyd Dobler, John Cusak's likable; softly spoken; kick-boxing fanatic high-schooler in his final year based in a suburban America with his family. Far from a slob but a long way from what might be perceived within the film's realm as academically imbued, Dobler's somewhat happy with being an easy-going and kind young man who has penchants and interests as well as a fondness for his close relatives; a man not afraid to confront another male if it transpires he made ill of another woman's feelings for whatever reason, yet is humble enough to have to give his automobile's cassette player a good whack if required when desiring to operate it. Principally, above all else; above the university places some have and above the goal to get as drunk as possible whilst one is still able to at this delicate stage in your life, Dobler's key interest is in Dianne Court (Skye): a young woman at Lloyd's school who's mostly everything Lloyd is not.Dianne is described, whilst off screen and with we the audience having yet to observe, as a girl ""with the body of a game-show hostess""; ear-opening when we realise these are words from the mouth of another young woman and is not a mere jibe from that of a male with nary much else but you-know-what on his mind. Dianne lives with her father, a rich rest home owner, in a large secluded home with its own gravel driveway; one of those which reaches the house and then finds enough time to spin around into a circle with a centrepiece in the middle. She has a place abroad, such is the way these things work in films such as these, a place in what is commonly used as the land of academia, in that she's on her way to a university in England for some studies of a prestigious sort. When we first observe Dianne, she is driven to her graduation ceremony by her father who's extremely proud; a leavers speech which she provides has everybody seemingly at her command, the film centralising the point of focus on Dianne without ever objectifying, as she finds the entire occasion very moving – moving in a way everybody else seemingly does not when they perhaps ought to, something that infers a person in touch with themselves and their emotions, and somebody perhaps a little above the rest of the graduates in this regard whom watch on before catching on.Through some brave and rather lucky means, Lloyd snaffles a date with Dianne; but surely, going by the opening scene of definition arguments and whatnot, it more than resembles something else close to a date but just not quite a date. He calls her house, gets put on with her father; already as nervous as anything, the insinuation that many-a male attempts as such what it is Lloyd's trying now is humorously put across when it transpires Dianne's father recalls attempted dates and so-forth by calling to mind what it is the various men drive. The night out itself is fraught with the potential of something going catastrophically wrong without anything necessarily going catastrophically wrong; a rather loud party fuelled by alcohol and large groups of youngsters huddled into rooms inside of a house that is made to look a lot smaller than it is. We don't feel as if this is exactly Dianne's scene, while Lloyd himself appears elusive; the pair of them coming together as attendees thin out and a small group of whom Lloyd knows congregates as the night draws to a close – Lloyd's role there ultimately seeing him put people straight and aid in the safety to prevent drink-driving, more than anything, in what might have been a more lewd display in more contemporary films.Say Anything... eventually mutates into a really quaint, really rather remarkably played love story between these two people whom at first seem at odds, but through spending enough time with each other, come to understand the authenticity of one another. In one scene, each party are asked on respective career and potential marital relations; neither party can give concrete answers that please the enquirers but both can reply honestly to the best of their own ability, something which binds them in this sense as Lloyd is granted deeper access into her home and her life which reveal minute flaws and such from her past deconstructing or demythifying prior perceptions he had that yet goes on to retain fondness. Crowe allows things to progress and naturally develop competently and engrossingly, a plot to do with tax evasion and the fall out that arrives with that melded into proceedings in a slick and pleasingly unassuming manner in conjunction with the primary material; the film coming to resemble a remarkably played coming of age film which works.",Say Anything

Where's the conflict? There's really no drama, only the budding romance of Lloyd and Diane in their last summer as teenagers and the few complications that arise from it. While the last half hour or so adds a bit more, the truth is that Crowe gets you hooked on a film solely about a guy and a girl falling in love. That just shows the power of relationships in film.""Say Anything..."" is about those two characters, played by John Cusack and Ione Skye, an unlikely couple that forms out of a desire to make the most of what little time they both have at home before entering ""the real world."" Their chemistry is simply fantastic in being both natural and believable. Things aren't so straightforward in love, however, and the bright future on Diane's horizon and her very close relationship with her father (John Mahoney) complicate things with Lloyd.Lloyd and Diane seem perfect, and the secret is that Lloyd's a little neurotic and Diane is the smart girl that thinks no one cares about her and their ""union"" is representative of how both get what they want despite their self-perceptions. As viewers, we see our own relationship flaws in them and that's what makes them lovable.The relationship between Diane and her father is also an incredibly strong one that gets established so well at the beginning that when the slight conflict of the film arises, it has a very strong impact. That's really what makes ""Say Anything..."" an instant classic in ways, the strength of its very normal characters.Crowe's script is very real yet very profound in many ways. Up front it's about trying to make love work, but the fact that it's only about Diane and Lloyd and Diane and her father sets up a parallel between the two relationships to show how they're more alike than Diane thinks as she tries to reconcile them both. It's very simple, but really excellent on Crowe's part, and that really sums up the film.",Say Anything
37,southdavid,Lloyd Of London,4,26 November 2019,"I watched ""Say Anything"" for what I think was the first time, a couple of days ago. I apologise in advance to any of you guys that saw the film in the 80's and its means something to you, but seeing it as I did, it's a nicely written, witty, but ultimately dull and meandering teen romantic comedy. High on realism, but lacking in dramatic content.Lloyd Dobler (John Cusack) is a pleasant, if unfocused, guy who is graduating senior school. Nursing a crush on Diane (Ioan Skye) for years, he plucks up the courage to call her and following a pleasant date they spend the summer turning a friendship into a relationship, though one that has a defined end date as Diane has won a scholarship to attend university in the UK. This summer also tests her formally rock solid relationship with her father, whose been enormously supportive, but is hiding a secret.My general feeling whilst watching the film was that I wished I was watching one of the other films, either staring John Cusack, or by Cameron Crowe, that I enjoy more than I was enjoying this one. Either ""Grosse Point Blank"", ""Almost Famous"" or ""High Fidelity"". ""Say Anything"" has some qualities it shares with those, John Cusack remains an actor I enjoy seeing and actually one that I miss seeing today (surely he's due a revival). The script of the film is funny and I also like how the film never resorted to the cliché's of the genre, the characters feel real, varied and authentic. It's particularly prevalent with Diane's father, played by John Mahoney. He's excellent and again his character avoids the usual tropes by encouraging Lloyd, despite his ill-defined future plans and seeming unsuitability for his daughter.The trouble is, though I believe and like the characters, I don't felt like they did anything to warrant spending time with them. I didn't buy the relationship between the Diane and Lloyd would really go anywhere (maybe that's the point) and because of that, I'm not invested enough them to care whether they make it or not. The film also seems to leave out a lot of the dramatic moments that might have made the plot more interesting, specifically related to how Diane reacts to what happens to her father but just in general too. Lloyd doesn't have to do enough to win over Diane, or do much to lose her, or do anything to get her back.I accept that it means a lot to the people that grew up with it, and I'm sure I have indefensible 80's favorites, but I can't pretend that I genuinely enjoyed ""Say Anything"".",Say Anything

40,hellraiser7,Saying Love,10,10 May 2021,"This film is one of my favorite romance films of all time, I'm personally not a big fan of the romance genre because there aren't that many in my book that hook me, or I can connect with. This film fortunately is one of them, it almost feels like one of those films that were almost made for people like myself. Cameron Crowe whom in the 80's was known for writing teen movies like ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"", the under the radar gem ""The Wild Life"", this one is the third and the very last in that teen trilogy and it was a great send off for it.Though also in a way this film was also one of the great send offs for the 80's decade as this film truly is one of the very last of it's kind from that era. Which makes watching the film a little bittersweet and special as part of the story ironically a young couple leaving both their homestead but teen hood, it's sort of metaphoric on our transition from the 80's to 90's decade.This romance story is unique from most romance films because it's not about the already tired trope of the boy or girl trying to get the other, but actually about both the boy and girl having an actual relationship which are the kind of romance stories I actually like best because we really get down to business where both the boy and girl can actually interact and build on things.Sidenote even love the fact that this film takes place in my hometown Seattle, Washington; watching the film now is even more interesting and a bit of a history lesson to any Seattle/Washingtonians or non on what that city use to look like in the 80's, though that's a little strange to say as it really doesn't look too different from right now, which all the more makes the film timeless.I really like how the film has a real sense of reality but in a good way and this help in the film not feeling like just another cookie cutter romance story from the Hallmark channel (though if you like those films that's fine). This also helps in avoiding some of the common pratfalls and clenches that most romance films are at times plagued with, like situations or bull crap subplots that are just suddenly pop in out of now where's ville which are related to the story, as really by their nature a cheap device to elevate or raise the stakes for the couple. This film does have a subplot, but it's actually turns out to be essential and a big part of the story latter on, it does raise the stakes for the couple but in a way that is actually believable because you really feel and care that their love and lives of both Lloyd and Diane are in actual real jeopardy.The characters in this are great because they don't actually feel like fictional character but actual people that could exist in real life and probably do.Really like supporting character Cori played well by underrated actress Lili Taylor. Her character I just think is cool and funny as she's sort of a slightly overdramatic rocker. Anyway, one favorite scene of mine with her is in the party scene where she claims to of made 63 (or 65 songs as Lloyd stated) based on her douchebag ex and is going to sing all of them, wow that is one long blues concert. But I really like that she a good friend and in a way sister figure to Lloyd as she gives him some good advice on some of the reality of what happens in love lives. She says a favorite quote of mine to Lloyd, ""The world has plenty of guys, don't be a guy, be a man."" Those words are more true now then they were then.Diane Court played well by Ione Skye who is a solid actress shame she never had a little more for the silver screen afterward. Her character just has this aura of loveliness to her both inside and out. She's sort of on the shy slightly introverted, smart side of things. She's really nice sort of the person that rarely gets angry, but you also see there is a little sadness to her but you not sure what or why but we do get subtle hints hearing about some of the prices she's paid to get where she is.This makes her character even more real as a lot of us that have worked hard in life or have done certain things realize there were a lot of other things undone or left out. Deep down though you sense she's a person that really does want more out of life, as we see as smart and wise as she is she's inexperienced and she wants that long void filled.But of course, my favorite character and the main draw is Lloyd Dauber played well by John Cusack whom is an honorable mention in favorite actors of mine. This one is my favorite role from him and of course his most iconic. This guy is just so loveable from beginning to end, he the guy that I can easily be friends with, though he's actually relatable as I'm a little like this guy in reality (I said a little).I love the outfit he wears with the trench coat and the regular casual 80's wear behind it, it reminds me of the outfit of the tenth Doctor from ""Doctor Who"", kind of makes me wonder if writers and minds behind the Tenth Doctor's run saw this film. In a way the closed to me feel like a way of saying, I don't care what anyone thinks, I'm just being me; that's true with Lloyd and ourselves.Another thing that justifies why we like Lloyd so much, is there is one scene where Lloyd he talks with this little group of guys that are hanging out at the Quick Stop like store and these guys are totally immature and nothing going (Cori's ex is part of this group, yeah bad sign there). Seeing that scene shows Lloyd truly is the real man, we want more people like Lloyd, not anymore of these poser jerks.In a way he's sort of millennial but in the best king of sense. I really love that he's into martial arts like myself as we see him constantly training and even works at a dojo. He says one of my favorite quote of mine based on that, ""I'm into Kickboxing, the sport of the future."" How right Lloyd is as by today's decade it's more popular than ever with MMA (Mixed Martial Arts) competitions that are happening everywhere.I also like him because he's truthful not just to Diane and his friends but himself, like in the dinner scene he has another memorable quote where he's says he doesn't know entirely what he wants to do for the future but he does no what he doesn't want to do. I like that and I feel that's actually a question that most young adults should be asked a lot more which is not just what they want to be in the future but what they don't want to be.The film also has a great mixture and balance in feelings, where that are parts of the film can be funny, happy as well as sad and you feel all those things at the right time. And make you all the more care for the couple and hope they win in the end.Lloyd and Diane are one of my favorite fictional couple because not just do they feel the most real which makes all the more care. But we can easily see how both of them truly are good for each other as we see both go though a arc. As we see further in the film when they both spend time together Lloyd becomes more confident and even makes something of his hobby by teaching at a kickboxing Dojo along with Diane whom become more outgoing and may even social.Despite no one really backing both up on the relationship (mainly Diane's dad whom I really don't like, he's a despicable grunge bag and you see the extent of it further in the film) both don't care what anyone things, they give each other a go and it actually works well and that's true about most other relationships how the other can be totally different but just love in general how it never defined by who the other is but what both people feel for each other.And of course it all leads to that famous boom box scene. It's truly is a great scene as it's one that is wordless and lets the audience fill in the blanks. It's pretty much a professing love scene but it's one that's done right because of the fact there are no words. The fundamental problem with scenes like that in some romance films are it can come off so overdramatic and silly that it makes the story fall apart all together.This scene is another prime example of how less can be more. There are so many ways this scene can be interpreted, could also reflect Diane's own desires not just for Lloyd but ones she's held back for so many years finally outside, booming loud and clear for her to hear, where she can no longer deny or hide them.However, I simply feel this is just Lloyd simply professing love for Diane, and if you notice in the background he isn't outside her window doing it but at a location that is further from her house and that I thought was great because it was a way of showing how true love knows no bounds.You don't need words to say love.Rating: 4 stars.",Say Anything
41,dee.reid,"Say Anything you want about ""Say Anything..."", but this is a great movie!",10,12 April 2015,"Most of us know about that scene, that famous scene where the guy is standing in the front yard outside the house of his girlfriend (or ex-girlfriend, I should say), after she just broke up with him the day before. It's early in the morning when he's decided to pull off this little stunt, and, standing next to his car, he's holding up a huge boom-box over his head blaring Peter Gabriel's ""In Your Eyes.""This is the most iconic and famous scene in Cameron Crowe's ""Say Anything..."", his 1989 debut which he both wrote and directed. This is a movie I've seen in clips over the years but have never actually sat down and watched the whole thing in its entirety. I've read the critical praise (the most significant coming from the late film critic Roger Ebert), ""Entertainment Weekly"" naming it the greatest modern romance AND ranking it at #11 on their list of 50 best high school movies, and a Valentine's Day article in ""The Washington Post"" from 2006 titled ""What I Did For Lloyd."" Now I've finally sat down and watched the movie and understood where it's all coming from.The 1980s were a wasteland of teen comedies. John Hughes (1950-2009) was behind the best of them (""The Breakfast Club,"" ""Sixteen Candles""). At the tail end of the decade, came Cameron Crowe and his ""Say Anything..."". This film is much like any teen comedy/romance to come out at that time (and ever since) and begins as such, with a ""noble underachiever"" who falls for an ultra-intelligent, if socially unskilled, beauty who seems way out of his league. The movie also seems to at least partially pre-figure the Seattle ""grunge"" era of the early '90s (which was spear-headed by the legendary grunge band Nirvana), but the exact details of this implication are part of another discussion entirely.Lloyd Dobler (John Cusack) is the noble underachiever who dares to ask out the beautiful high school valedictorian Diane Court (Ione Skye) the day after their graduation. Lloyd's ambitions are pretty slim, since the only thing he can really see himself doing in the immediate future is Kick-boxing (which at that time was still a relatively new thing). So at least he's honest about his life's aspirations: he knows what he wants to do, and he especially knows what he DOESN'T want to do - which does shock some people and makes him the most truthful character in the entire film. But it's an even bigger shock when he decides that he wants to go out with the lovely Diane Court.Diane, on the other hand, has her whole life set out before her. She's worked hard her entire life to work her way up to the top of her high school graduating class. And all that hard work pays off when she learns she's been granted a fellowship to further her studies overseas in England. And she'll be leaving at the end of the summer. And then there's Lloyd, who impulsively asks her out on a date and much to his surprise, she accepts his invitation. They do go out, they enjoy one another's company, they connect, and their feelings of just being ""friends with potential"" do gradually deepen into love. While Diane's over-protective father James Court (John Mahoney) seems to like Lloyd, he mostly sees him as a distraction and someone who's going to steer her away from the future she's worked so hard to achieve.We like Lloyd and Diane both, and we want them to be together. But like any good love story, there has to be roadblocks, and these roadblocks hurt...In a major subplot, however, James, owner of an elderly-care facility, is also being investigated by the IRS for tax fraud. This subplot would be a most unnecessary distraction from an otherwise touching teen romance, but the way everything turns out and why it's even happened in the first place is just one of the many unique charms of ""Say Anything..."" and why it stands out amongst most teen romance films made before and since. A less ambitious movie would JUST be about Lloyd & Diane's relationship and nothing else, but ""Say Anything..."" has other things on its mind beside those two - even though it still hurts us when outside forces cause them to separate for a time. ""Say Anything..."" wants to show us how their relationship is affecting everyone around them, and how everyone around them is affecting them, as well.""Say Anything..."" is a wondrously scripted, acted, and directed film; it's definitely an early indication of the skill of a writer and director with huge ideas, huge potential. Crowe knew his characters well and chose his performers even better. John Cusack and Ione Skye are the dynamic young stars playing Lloyd and Diane. Like John Hughes before him and who dominated the early portion of the 1980s teen scene, Cameron Crowe knew how to make a ""smart"" teen film: one that is not filled with stupid sex jokes and even stupider characters - teens and adults alike.With that in mind, I can see how an audience so cynical in 1989 after being bombarded with teen comedy after teen comedy throughout the earlier portion of the decade can very easily write off ""Say Anything..."" as just Another Teen Movie. It's a teen film, yes, and an occasionally very funny one, too, but it's also an extraordinarily moving and compelling one, as well. So I can also see how that cynicism would wear off once the movie really begins to reveal itself to the audience - especially with its emotional honesty and maturity, and the fact that it's actually a very well-written and acted little piece of cinema.So it's really no wonder why you can Say Anything you want about ""Say Anything..."" but you cannot deny that it is not a great movie!10/10",Say Anything
42,mjneu59,young love in the 1980s,6,31 December 2010,"Former Rolling Stone journalist Cameron Crowe thinks he has his finger on the pulse of America's youth, and on the evidence of his debut as a film director he certainly shows a gift for capturing all the arcane nuances of modern teen language and manners (circa 1988, at any rate). His film pulls the rug out from under most examples of its kind, presenting a High School romance with genuine emotional appeal and with two believable characters: an ambitious valedictorian worried about her image as a 'priss' and a hyper-tense but gallant kickboxer (""the sport of the future"", so he says) with no clear idea where life is taking him. It's as close to an honest depiction of first love as you're likely to see from Hollywood, but the real heart of the film is Ione Skye's trusting relationship with her father (John Mahoney), who may seem too good to be true (because he isn't). Skye's choice between loving father and loyal boyfriend is ultimately made for her by the IRS, but otherwise the film is a welcome relief from the empty packages usually sold to teen moviegoers these days.",Say Anything

47,bkrauser-81-311064,Illustrating All Kinds of Love,7,25 February 2014,"Say Anything (1989) is one of those rare late-eighties, early-nineties romantic comedies that can appeal to both men and the fairer sex. You know the type: When Harry Met Sally (1989) Pretty Woman (1990) Sleepless in Seattle (1993) et al. Yet Say Anything is one of the few exceptionally good and mature love stories that takes place in the torrid-love-affair-overload land of high school. Well maybe not, it more takes place in the insular time between high school and college but let's not split hairs for the sake of the kids.John Cusack plays an eccentric yet well-meaning goofball whose been pining for the school's valedictorian for a good long while. His friends played by Amy Brooks and a singularly jejune Lily Taylor think she's out of his league; ""brains stick with brains,"" she says while strumming her guitar. Yet Lloyd Dobler takes a chance anyway and to his great surprise gets a yes from Ione Skye's ethereal ingénue. They then are given the summer to bond before she goes to college in England.The start of the movie lulls you into a false sense of knowing. Of course Lloyd Dobler is going to end up going out with Diane Court. Everyone including her father (John Mahoney) doesn't think it's going to work out. Their names are even phonetically at odds. Diane? Lloyd? Might as well call them Joe and Princess Ann. Yet this movie isn't about falling in love, it's about being in love and believe me there is a big difference.Dobler and Diane grow to love one another by relating to each other and have a mutual interest in learning about each other. Lloyd looks out for her and accepts the goals she has made for herself and adapts accordingly. While we do see less adaptation from Diane it's hard for her to accommodate Lloyd when his life plans are so up in the air. Yet even with his tacit inkling towards a career in kickboxing you can tell Diane would be there to support him when push comes to shove. They have a good thing going and quickly shed the clique dynamics of high school in exchange for something more real.Real and less volatile as evidenced by the juxtaposition of Lily Taylor's obsession with a two timer named Joe (Loren Dean). That single relationship informs her worldview and is the impetuous for her songwriting yet at first glance he clearly isn't worth the heartache. It's a childish obsession at odds with Lloyd's commitment based interconnection with Diane. When Diane describes her first sexual experience with Lloyd to her father, it wasn't a decision wholly based on a whim. She put thought into her adult decision and Lloyd was right there, chomping at the bit like guys would, but still being an adult about it.Diane is given abundant support by her loving father who is displeased with her choice in boyfriend. Lloyd might be sincere but his ambitions are nebulous which would concern any protective father. Yet don't think for a moment John Mahoney's Mr. Court is the bad guy, even if the subplot involving money laundering feels skivvy. The very fact that Diane could confide in him when she loses her virginity should be evidence enough of their special bond. Even Lloyd picks up on the supportive relationship saying ""You two are amazing, you know? The way you talkI'm not even like that with anybody."" Say Anything is a romantic comedy in the classical sense. In one exchange Diane says ""Nobody thinks it will work do they?"" to which Lloyd retorts, ""No, you just described every great success story."" Yet director Cameron Crowe probes deeper than frivolity. It's a love story that examines love through sacrifice, commitment, compromise and growth. There are many films that express the elation of falling hear over heals, the serendipity of forming close bonds and the promise of romance. But few ever give you the true meaning and consequence of love. Ultimately it's not about a sentimental letter or sending flowers, mostly it's about holding someone's hands and telling them things are going to turn out alright.",Say Anything
48,Howlin Wolf,FILM anything... !,5,28 July 2008,"I expected to really like this movie and I found myself surprisingly disappointed by the end of it. I would have thought there would have been more layers to a script that Cameron Crowe turned out...What's puzzling is that when events have no possible motive aside from the obvious, when characters aren't illuminated well enough to make them all appreciably different from the norm, then one would have thought that there isn't a reason to tell the story.I like the colour red. No particular reason why, I just do. There would seem little point in making a movie about my preference though unless there's some kind of interesting rationale behind it.There are tons of guy meets girl stories out there. If anyone had a mind to, they could tell the exact same story over and over again, changing only the names and faces of the people concerned. Generally though, any romance movie tries to have a different element to its story that makes it stand out. The reason this felt so bland is that, if you took away the pleasing efforts of the actors involved, there weren't enough quirks in the tale - and that's because the people it was happening to were all too ordinary and sensible!It's not that what transpires is at all unbelievable, it's just that if I'm watching a work of fiction and I feel that I know people who've said and done EXACTLY the same things, then the entertainment experience becomes ordinary - and I want to see something different in a way that justifies the large-scale expansion of being developed for the big screen.",Say Anything
49,rivertam26,Timeless and genuine,8,23 February 2020,I saw this movie when I was much older and could appreciate it. John Cusack is absolutely adorable as Lloyd who asks his high school crush out before she goes off to college. The movie is fun and weird and genuine. The chemistry between the leads is solid and both Joan Cusack and Lili Taylor are great in side roles.

Of course,I'm not going to suggest I was anything near as charismatic and actualized as Lloyd Dobler(John Cusack). He,of course,the hero of the film is a laid-back high school graduate whose only real ambition is to be a professional kick-boxer. That,and to win the love of one Diane Court(Ione Skye).

54,hall895,Be a man. Don't be a guy.,7,15 April 2012,"Lloyd Dobler has got it all figured out. Except he doesn't realize he's got it all figured out. He's just graduated high school and now what? He aspires to be a kickboxer which is a way of saying he has no prospects whatsoever, no future. But he knows what he wants. And what he wants most of all is to be with Diane Court. Diane is the school's golden girl. A brain trapped in the body of a game show hostess is the way her classmates describe her. She's the class valedictorian, winner of a prestigious fellowship which will have her leaving her Seattle home at the end of the summer to go study in England. Which leaves her with very little time to forge a romantic relationship. Not that she has any real chance of a relationship anyway. Intimidated by her brains and beauty guys find Diane unapproachable. Her classmates know of her but they don't really know her. So caught up in her studies and so seemingly unattainable, she never really had any friends, certainly no lovers. But Lloyd Dobler is ready to reach for the unreachable star. He calls her up out of the blue and, never mind the fact she really has no idea who he is, invites her to a graduation party. She says no, he persists, she says yes. And a love affair is born.Lloyd opens Diane's eyes to a whole new world. She allows herself to love and laugh, to really live for the first time. Not particularly enthused with this new relationship is Diane's father. He's always been the only man in her life, her only true friend and confidant. When her parents divorced Diane chose to live with her father and their lives proceeded according to his plan. He would do anything for his daughter, always be there for her to push her towards her dreams. But were they really her dreams or his? And how exactly did he finance these dreams? The IRS would like to know. Her father's under investigation, she's just fallen in love and she's headed for England in a few months. Diane's life is in complete turmoil. But Lloyd can be her rock. If she'll let him.Lloyd may seem to have no future but he has a wisdom beyond his years. Listen to the speech he gives Diane's father about what he wants to do with his life. Or more accurately, what he doesn't want to do with his life. It may not be a good enough plan for Diane's father but Lloyd knows the path to happiness. And for him right now that path involves spending as much time with Diane as possible. But her impending departure and her father's legal travails put pressure on the relationship and it all falls apart. Again though Lloyd has it all figured out. Certainly more than the guys hanging out at the Gas 'n' Sip do, as Lloyd drops some more precious wisdom on them. And then, urged on by his female friends to be more than a guy, to be a man, Lloyd goes about reclaiming his girl with the help of film's most legendary boombox.And they all lived happily ever after? Nope, this film is smarter than that, doesn't take the easy way out. Writer/director Cameron Crowe takes his time bringing the couple back together, to the point you wonder if they're actually going to get back together at all. This is no cheap, easy, formulaic teen romantic comedy. The characters have depth and brains and the central relationship is allowed to run a realistic, natural course. Nothing is rushed. And there is room for some wonderful, witty and in some cases now iconic dialogue along the way. Crowe wrote a terrific script, guided his actors with a strong hand and produced a real gem. John Cusack as Lloyd and Ione Skye as Diane are terrific in the key roles and are ably supported by a number of other fine performers. John Mahoney gives off such a good-at-heart vibe as Diane's father and then when things turn for the character Mahoney's performance evolves beautifully. Lili Taylor plays Lloyd's quirky musician friend. If you wrong this girl she's gonna write a song about it. Or 63 songs about it. Your heart breaks for her even as you can't help but laugh at her snarling musical missives to her ex. Other familiar faces like Joan Cusack and Philip Baker Hall pop up in small but important roles. It all comes together with a story which entertains, captivates and warms the heart. There are laughs but there's plenty of drama too all the way right up to the final scene, one of the best movie endings ever which has your heart right up in your throat to the very last moment. Lloyd and Diane went on a magical ride during their summer of love. Crowe took his audience on quite a ride as well.",Say Anything
55,sharky_55,"Forget it, I don't care.",8,16 July 2016,"Most know the iconic scene of Cusack on the front lawn, blasting jukebox held aloft. It's like Romeo under the balcony, yearning for a girl that is worlds away from his grasp. In this teen film from the late 80s the conflict is also initially set up as a clash of class; the diligent, good two-shoes valedictorian Diane, effortlessly beautiful in her spare time, and the roughly-hewn Lloyd, who tells of his aspirations to be a professional kick-boxer as if this was the punchline to a joke, and has missed all of careers advice sessions. What many don't remember is the material beneath these stereotypes, and how the film is not only an exploration of tender young love, but also the tenuous relationship between a father and his precious daughter, a prize won from divorce. The young couple aren't exempt from the usual teenage woes. Close friend Corey has gone through a breakup and has coped by writing no less than 63 songs about her hated ex; Lloyd later goes through the same process, documenting the past relationship through a tape recorder, his morose speech dripping with angst: ""The rain on my car is a baptism. The new me."" But Crowe doesn't put this in his film because he is mocking them. He knows all that they go through, how the teenage years heighten each emotion into infinity and make every triumph an explosion of joy and every setback the end of the world. When Lloyd visits his male friends after the breakup, their dialogue is typical of their age and maturity; they are immediately dismissive of the aforementioned ex, they suggest alternatives, they crassly write off the entire gender. But Crowe also recognises that this is how boys offer comfort in such a situation; by shielding insecurity and underplaying emotional blow-back. He understands how supremely self conscious and embarrassed people at this age are. The most honest moment of the film comes when Lloyd and Diane are wrapped up in an embrace in the back of a car in the middle of the night, and how Lloyd's shaking tells us more about their yearn and desire than any passionate kiss or ""I love you"" could. Diane's father is the obstacle that stands in their way. Crowe is smart enough to not draw him like the typical father in these types of movies, the stuck-up, stuffy stereotype that cares more about his family's reputation than his daughter's feelings. When Diane emerges from a night spent with Llyod, he knows that he has a right to be angry. In a lesser film he would plug his ears and immediately ground her. Here, he vents, but he also slows down enough to actually listen to his daughter. He does not approve, but he understands, and their relationship improves because of it. ""You can say anything to me,"" is the title and theme, and John Mahoney does not only say it, but makes us believe it. In his actions he also makes it clear that everything he does is for the best of his daughter's future and well-being. This includes the revelation that his nursing home as been illegally embezzling money from its elderly patients. The intended effect of this twist is that it severely undermines anything that Jim has expressed beforehand. Crowe clearly sets up the switch between Lloyd and Jim, with him receiving the pen and being the one who is cast off by Diane. But the film stumbles here, because although Jim's imprisonment sours his good intentions, it does not invalidate his opinions of the person dating his daughter. Lloyd is still an airhead with no tangible future prospects. A noble airhead maybe (""I don't want to buy anything, sell anything, or process anything as a career.""), and one that also has Diane in his best interests, but an airhead nonetheless. There is a better ending somewhere here, one that doesn't rely on smearing the father in order to ensure that the young couple are allowed to steal away carefree and in love.",Say Anything
56,tim-764-291856,John & Joan....,7,17 May 2012,"The two Cusack siblings always provide great, very watchable characters and here John, plays Lloyd Dobler (awful name!) a fresh-faced 19 y.o kick-boxing student, who underachieves at school and sees the military as a back-up career. He's likable, as is usual with John's characters, portraying zestful youth and who is basically a good guy.Joan plays his sister, which is a minor role but she still shines. The basic story is that Lloyd sits next to Ione Skye (who came up with these names?), a pretty Diane Court, who her father James, (John Mahoney, Martin Crane, ""Dad"" in Frasier) calls 'Prissy'.He's a bit old fashioned and understandably protective and wonders if Lloyd as Prissy's boyfriend would be any better than any of the others. There's some great chemistry between the leads, dating in cars and 'hanging out' together that reminds one of more youthful days (in my case!) and is all quietly uplifting. There's also that juicy complication used in modern rom-comes - Prissy is off to England, to study, adding dilemma and complications all round.That part works well. The sideline about James and his embezzling was a surprisingly effective one, that added meat to the bones and made the film more rounded and helped us to understand his protective nature. That it's Mahoney, a superb actor and making it look so easy, helped enormously.Cameron Crowe's film, apparently never made it into cinemas in the U.K. Heaven alone knows why not, considering the utter dross that does.Say Anything is probably considered a minor film and whilst it's not great and won't be remembered as much as some, it certainly was an enjoyable little movie.

57,juliankennedy23,Say Anything... Anything,7,9 October 2009,"Say Anything...: 7 out of 10: Repeat after me; Cameron Crowe is a genus. Nobody wrote dialogue for teenagers as he did. In his films they talk like actual people. (I have never written a screenplay myself but from the evidence of the sheer number of filmed screenplays, that fail absolutely at this, I would gander that it is quite difficult.) While Fast Times at Ridgemont High created his reputation, Say Anything cemented it. There simply is not a false note in the entire film. All three leads (Ione Skye, John Cusack, and John Mahoney) are pitch perfect. The situations are realistic and flow well. The support cast is also excellent. The ending is both realistic and sweet.While Say Anything is without faults, it also is not very memorable. Unlike the previous Fast Times at Ridgemont High, there are only a few scenes that stick out. It is a pleasant story and certainly worth a revisit if it has been twenty years since you saw it.I on the other hand saw for the first time a few days ago. Unfortunately, I was to busy watching movies like Less than Zero in the late eighties to see Say Anything. Imagine how much better my life could have turned out if I had only allowed Mr. Crowe to guide me one more time.",Say Anything

Three-dimensional characters with very relatable conflicts. Mahoney steals the movie as Skye's father, who is just so freaking awesome that it's too good to be true which, sadly, ends up being the case. There are a few story choices that force the movie off track unnecessarily, but it's just straight-up knit-picking to say it negatively affects the overall viewing experience or quality of the film.

Thankfully, it delivers some much needed chemistry between the two in relationships, John Cusack and Ione Skye. Both love each other, and both are plagued over the tough times that follow. Above all, their acting performances are generally acceptable, with some admirable plotting involved, but it's got that sudden shift from being a funny comedy to a heartfelt drama all along. It is highly noted for an unforgettable scene with Cusack holding a boombox over his head when the Peter Gabriel song plays. Don ""The Dragon"" Wilson appears as a sparring partner. There are strong feelings and emotions to cherish in this fine pre-Gen-X teen film, so hold on to your girlfriends for love's sake. Don't call me Cupid, though!",Say Anything
60,alice liddell,"I tried desperately hard to like this, but... (possible spoiler)",5,26 January 2000,"Like most 80s high school movies, this has sadly, badly dated.  Sadly, because it stars the incomparable John Cusack, the only reason for still watching this, giving a typically rich performance alternating nervy confidence with masked vulnerability.  He plays Lloyd Dobler, an average(ish) high school student who is about to graduate.  He lives with his single mother sister Constance and her young son, while his parents are with the American army in Germany.He is besotted with Diane Court, an apparently beautiful brainbox whose astonishing academic success has been achieved at the cost of peer contact. She lives with her father, James, who runs a lucrative old folks home, and who comes under investigation from the IRS for mismanaging and defrauding his clients' money.  Diane is awarded a prestigious scholarship in England, but becomes derailed by her relationship with LLoyd, who, for all his aimlessness, offers her an emotional security she never had with her acrimoniously divorced parents.  She is seemingly obliged to decide between Lloyd and a glittering career, until shock revelations about her father force things to a head.There is nothing offensively wrong with SAY ANYTHING.  There is vague pleasure to be had in spotting future minor celebrities (Eric Stoltz, Jeremy Piven, Lili Taylor).  Writer/director Crowe tries to incorporate a few formal devices into a generally naturalistic framework, such as the pseudo-Greek chorus of Lloyd's three girlfriends counterpointed with his late-night advice session from his male friends.The film is also mildly subversive.  The scene seems set for a reactionary tract about broken homes - Lloyd's parents are absent, Diane's are divorced. It might be suggested that the fears and aimlessness felt by the young in the movie arise from a lack of direction offered by the parents.  The parents are the culpable ones here, in Diane's case horrifically, unexpectedly so.  Lloyd is a thoroughly decent and dependable, as a surrogate father, as a kick-boxing coach.  Diane is finally able to make a decision after the burden of parental pressure is lifted.  It is seen as right to abandon the tainted tradition of the past.This is figured in the wonderful role-reversal ending.  All the way, as Hollywood convention decrees, it seems as if Lloyd, as male hero, is going to be Diane's teacher, despite her brains - he shows her how to fit in with her peers, how to achieve independence from her father, how to drive etc. But at the end, he goes to England with her; she is allowed fulfil her career; he is the, usually female-coded, hanger-on.  An 80s film about leaving America for Europe suggests an anti-Jamesian quest for freedom from corruption, uncertainty etc.  Happily, the film ends on unbalance and doubt.ANYTHING's problems are two-fold: contrivance and lack of humour.  There is an air of phoniness about the whole thing, from the tried and tired 80s high school movie rituals, to the gropings for emotion (using sub-Phil Collins music as signifiers for emotion is really tacky and distancing).  The whole film, as my wife pointed out, is shot in a flat, TV-movie style, which focuses the now embarrassing 80s detritus.The lack of humour is the fatal flaw for a supposed comedy - anything that could be satirised is turned into melodrama; the fratboy slapstick has been done better elsewhere, the determination to take these characters oh-so-seriously lessens any attempt to see their angst as faintly ridiculous.  Which leaves verbal comedy.  As the title suggest, there is a running thematic motif concerning communication, truth, concealment, the ability to formulate emotion in words.  You can't say anything, it must be the right thing.  But too much talk and too little visual distance results in a very dull film.  It IS interesting that middle-class white boys wanted to be black so early as 1989.  Of course, there isn't a single black character in the film.",Say Anything

62,oOoBarracuda,Say Anything...,10,24 April 2017,"Just before graduation, Lloyd Dobler (John Cusack) is convinced that he had a date with the valedictorian with a brain ""trapped in the body of a game-show hostess"" because they shared a table together while eating at the mall one day. After bantering back and forth with his best friends Cory (Lili Taylor) and D.C. (Amy Brooks) about the un-attainability of Diane Court's (Ione Skye) social position in relation to Lloyd's, he decides to go for it and call her. Perhaps no one is more surprised than Lloyd when Diane Court not only calls him back but agrees to go on a date with him. Diane accompanies Lloyd to an annual graduation party held at the home of a former student of the high school. Diane, who has largely been hidden away from her classmates studying and enjoying none of the social aspects of high school. Her classmates are glad to finally meet and get to know Diane in an informal setting, and Diane is pleased to finally feel as though she has friends in her life other than her hands-on father, James Court (John Mahoney). After much deliberation and internal conflict after being accepted to a fellowship program in England, Diane decides to keep seeing Lloyd, on a strictly platonic basis. Lloyd takes this understanding because to him, any time with Diane Court is better than time apart from Diane Court. Lloyd decides to make his summer ambition to spend as much time with Diane as possible before she leaves. Disappointed that his daughter has settled on a lesser-than-she ""distraction"", James quickly begins to care less about how Diane chooses to spend her time, as his own problems arise. Ultimately a decision must be made between the life Diane has always imagined, or has been imagined for her, and the one that is unfolding.""I don't want to sell anything, buy anything, or process anything as a career. I don't want to sell anything bought or processed, or buy anything sold or processed, or process anything sold, bought, or processed, or repair anything sold, bought, or processed. You know, as a career, I don't want to do that."" Lloyd may not know what he wants to do, but he knows what he doesn't want to do, and that may be more important. Lloyd Dobler is my favorite character, perhaps in cinema history. He's got a lot going for him, Lloyd is protective of his friends, he's introspective, independent, undaunted by going against social norms, he's willing and able to teach, as well as learn, and he's adaptable. Lloyd is also fully equipped with a myriad of characteristics that can't be taught. Lloyd is existential, and is constantly thinking about the world, Lloyd listens to people; he actually listens to people with the intent to hear what they are saying and respond/react to it. Lloyd is a person that genuinely wants those around him to be happy. He cares so deeply for his friends that he only wants the best for him. Maybe the best of Lloyd's innumerable endearing qualities is that he knows how to comfort people on an individual level. Who doesn't long for someone in their life that knows them so well, they know exactly how to make them feel better when they are down. That's Lloyd Dobler, and we should all be so fortunate to have someone like that in our lives. Maybe I just like this film so much because it came at the exact right moment that I needed it, or because I associate it with the best year of my life; either way, I am thankful for Say Anything... and of course, kickboxing, it really was the sport of the future.",Say Anything

67,disinterested_spectator,Overrated,5,17 September 2015,"Boy meets girl. Boy loses girl. Boy gets girl back again. This formula for a romantic comedy is all right when all you want to do is pass the time watching a mildly amusing movie. But when it is one of the movies listed in Steven Jay Schneider's ""1001 Movies You Must See before You Die,"" you expect a little more. I suspect it is the fact that Cameron Crowe wrote and directed this movie that mesmerized critics into thinking it was something special.In addition to the formula noted above, this movie also employs the standard Hollywood device of having a woman forced to make a choice between love and something else, and then when she chooses love, as the formula requires, she ends up getting the something else too. Usually, the woman's choice is between a boring but respectable man whom her family approves of and who will be able to provide for her in comfort, and a charming man that she loves but who is poor and irresponsible. But when she decides to marry the poor guy, it turns out he has all the money. The movie ""French Kiss"" (1995) would be an example of this.In this movie, the woman is Diane, and she herself is the boring but respectable person whom her father, Mr. Court, approves of and who will be able to provide for herself in comfort owing to the fact that she is on her way to having a successful career after she gets out of college. This constitutes a slight variation in the formula. In any event, she must choose between her own education/career and Lloyd, the poor and irresponsible guy she loves whose idea of a career is that of being a kickboxer. Of course, there are movies in which a woman must choose between a career and a husband, but it is usually a glamorous career like show business, as in ""Imitation of Life"" (1959), not the kind of respectable career that Diane is pursuing.Actually, Lloyd's charm wears a little thin. He is living with his sister, who is a single mom, and he gets on her nerves with his antics. She makes a mark for the volume knob on his boom box, beyond which level he must not go, because it disturbs the neighbors. But he apparently does not care about that, because later in the movie, he takes the boom box and plays his and Diane's song at volume ten near her house in the middle of the night to prove his love for her, probably waking up all the neighbors on the block. It is one thing to be irresponsible. It is another thing to be an inconsiderate jerk. One wonders just how long Diane is going to put up with him, especially since his plan seems to be to just let her support him, as when he tells her father, ""What I want to do for a living is be with your daughter."" I guess you could say that in this movie it is the man who chooses between having a glamorous career like kickboxing and just being a house husband.Presumably as a way of avoiding the obvious formulaic nature of this film, a little trouble for Mr. Court with the Internal Revenue Service is added in. It begins rather melodramatically, with a couple of IRS agents showing up at his house at night. In real life, an auditor would begin his investigation by showing up at Court's place of business, which is a nursing home, and asking to see the books. In a subsequent scene, an IRS agent does show up at the nursing home and asks ominous questions like, ""Your income, Mr. Court, hasn't changed substantially in seventeen years. Why would you stay so long with an operation that is clearly not a growth enterprise?"" Wow! Isn't that incriminating!By this time, we are starting to think that the IRS agents are absurd caricatures, and that Court will be vindicated in the end. But it turns out that Court really is guilty. However, if he has been stealing money from his patients, then it would seem he is in more trouble than just not paying his taxes. There should still be fraud charges to deal with. But the movie glosses over that.Once we accept that Court is guilty of defrauding his nursing home patients, there are further incongruities that the movie presents without explaining. For example, Court goes to a store to buy some luggage, but all his credit cards are rejected. At the same time, Diane discovers thousands of dollars in cash squirreled away in a drawer. So, why didn't Court use the cash to buy the luggage? Cash leaves no tracks, and even the IRS would not have been aware of that purchase.Beyond that, the movie seems to at first to suggest that Court was stealing all that money in order to provide for his daughter, and so we are supposed to like him for that. But then it turns out that he was using all of his ill-gotten gains to buy collectibles, like a nine thousand dollar juke box. In other words, he's an idiot. The function of this IRS subplot is to break the excessive attachment between father and daughter so that she is free to leave him for Lloyd. But calling in the Feds so that a girl can leave home and marry the boy she loves is a bit much.",Say Anything

This movie needs a few minus 100 reviews to bring the average down to some sort of sane and realistic number. This is easily the worst of ALL the movies of it's genre of the era, and quite frankly of all time. Cameron Crowe got everything wrong! Nobody acted or behaved like real people would. Not even close. It was annoying how sickeningly awful the dialoge and acting was. Ione Skye. Hmmm....the most interesting thing about her is the spelling of her name. She has absolutely no personality in this movie. She is a heap of dullness wrapped in a few layers of bland and topped off with pure lack of talent. No wonder her career went nowhere. It should have never gotten off the ground in the first place. Either her or her family must know the right people. Her father was even worse as the overbearing protecting cliche of a Dad, who for some reason is made out to be a criminal. The whole scam he's alleged to perpetrate is impossible to carry out. No way the authorities would inform the daughter of their investigation. Absolutely unnecessary sub-plot that goes nowhere. He should have opened his veins in that bathtub scene, which incidentally made me bust out laughig. Cameron Crowe you were so clueless on this one!! This movie made me loathe you forever. John Cusack can't even bring this movie out of it's funk. He's kind of an idiot himself, and the attraction he feels to the plywood personality of Ione is baffling and rings completely untrue. Fake, in other words. His girlfriends are also uninteresting and moronic frivilous girls and add nothing to the plot. How can one director bring out the worst in everybody? It's just not real life feel. The party at the beginning sums up the whole feel of this movie. It was so clolyingly bad and overdone it made me laugh, then made me sick. Some dumb chick singing awful songs about some dude who made her try to commit suicide who ends up asking her for sex. Duh.....predictable. The dialogue is the corniest repetitive drivel you're likely to hear. Absolute crap. Soundtracks from that era are usually upbeat and memorable too, but not here. He got that wrong too. Everyone is dense and selfish and very difficult to like. One scene after another of insultingly stupid nonsensen. And all this talk about love. They're kids and haven't any idea about love. It's an issue I have with all the movies of this type, but here it's glaring and in your face because it's so inconceibable. Garbage. You've never seen acting so horrendous. There's absolutely no chemistry between the lead characters whatsoever. None. The dialogue was so stupid. Some story about an airplane and kids. Who cares? A speech about ageism. C'mon. John C. Knows acting, and I'm sure he knew he was in a huge stink fest but he pushed through and it was so sad to witness. Oh, and wearing a Clash shirt does not make you edgy. Even edgy people change their clothes once in a while. His rambling on and on on the phone grew tedious. We're supposed to think he's so deep and hurt but he's just a pathetic loser like everybody in this. Nuke the whole town and spare us any chance of a reunion sequel. There's not one moment in this movie that's sincerely touching or humorous. Selfish people using each other. Leave it to Ione Skye to drag the romantic comedy to it's most vile, phony and absurd depths. The holding the radio scene was nothing. Flat. No charisma or any emotion stirred at all. The confrontation between Ione and her father was ridiculous and way too long. This movie seemed like it ran for 6 hours. The chat with the Dad and John C. Behind bars was the final topper to this open cesspool of mediocrity. The Dad keeps singing the same old song, and he's the most useless piece of garbabe in this movie. Yelling the obvious doesn't make for effective story telling. And to be honest, Cameron's most successful movies I couldn't stand either. I just think he's an awful film maker with no vision or real ideas. The King Of Cringe. Dumbest ending ever, so at least the movie was consistent throughout. The only person any good in this movie was Joan C. And unfortunately we only got a few minutes of her. Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb Dumb.",Say Anything
70,monkeysgalore,Overrated and Annoying Teenage Melodrama,5,10 February 2020,"I didn't hate ""Say Anything"", but I don't at all think it's deserving of its high rating or praise. Sure the performances were good, but it's a romance movie so there should be more. I didn't get a lot of the scenes and writing moves, and the characters weren't very relatable.I usually watch action and thriller films, and occasionally comedies, because they're dependable genres. It's not hard to do an action film, or create tension and suspense in a thriller. It's easy to tell jokes and create comedic situations in a comedy film. I will watch dramas, although I usually have to be in the mood for them. The problem with romantic comedies or romantic dramas is that they're so hit-or-miss. The romantic relationship is the face of the story. It's not an underdeveloped subplot or a cheap add-on, it's the soul of the film, therefore it has to be very good. Many films fail in creating a believable or relatable relationship between the leads, especially both together. Another trope of the ""rom-com"" genre is the inevitable obstacles and bumps in the road the couples face, and the unfortunate situation that develops in the beginning of the third act before they ultimately make up and get back together.Basically, the movie is John Cusack hounding this popular girl in high school until she gives him a chance. She begins to realize that he's a nice guy, and better than she gave him credit for. All pretty standard stuff, really. I guess most of the movie's praise lies in its nostalgia for children of the 80s, as is the case with most of those 80s high school movies. But I was born in 2003 so I'm viewing this more objectively. I did appreciate that the main characters didn't meet by chance, and that their relationship gradually developed.My main issues were that John Cusack's character was too needy. He was actually obnoxious at some parts. His whole being was wrapped up in the girl. I hate it when the male lead is such a wuss and is ""nothing"" without the girl. His behavior was almost harassment-levels of annoying. And the girl was obnoxious too. She never just said what she wanted to say, and Cusack's character had to make all of the decisions. Towards the middle of the film, she breaks up with him when she obviously loves him, and she never really explains why. Both characters were not relatable, and while the relationship developed, the characters themselves never did. Both of the leads stayed the same pretty much throughout the movie.My overall opinion is that this is just another piece of mildly enjoyable, standard, angsty 80s teen fare. I may be in the minority, but I find it hard not to be. This could've been ay better than it was.",Say Anything
71,Jared_Andrews,the title says it all,8,1 August 2014,"Few movies can boast more apropos titles than Say Anything. It serves as both title and a summary. The characters have such charming and open communication lines with one another. Most notably was the relationship between Diane and her father. A child of divorce, Diane was forced to choose with which parent she wanted to live. She chose her father, and this led them to build an amazingly close and unique bond. They talk about anything and everything with little to no hesitation and feel nothing but relief and acceptance after they share the information.Lloyd has a similar bond with his female friends. They are brutally honest, yet lovingly supportive, a beautiful combination that makes every on screen conversation a joy to behold. They two groups have plenty of hearty discussions as Lloyd and Diane progress from near strangers to teenage love birds. Lloyd, who initiates the contact with Diane, uses a remarkably simple approach to winning her heart—he asks her out and then spends time with her. All he needed was the courage to pursue what he wanted. No one else had the guts to ask out the beautiful and mysterious Diane. Lloyd gained her affection with the simple act of effort.That's the most fascinating thing about Lloyd—he is clearly an underachiever, but this seems due almost entirely to lack of desire rather than talent or skill. In the entire film he cares about only two things: Diane and Kickboxing (the sport of the future, he claims). He pursues those two passions with prodigious vigor and eventually reaches laudable success with both. Desire is the key for Lloyd.In congruence with the charming bonds in the movie is the theme of love, or more specifically the question, is love enough? The relationship between Lloyd and Diane seems to suggest that the answer is yes. Although, Diane and her father hit a massive speed bump that threatens their relationship, despite the obvious love that they have for each other. Perhaps love is enough as long as no one completely screws it up.SPOILER ALERT: I must briefly talk about the ending. Diane and Lloyd are on a plane to continue their life together in Europe. This is clearly going to be a tricky situation with Lloyd looking for work while Diane is in school. Any number of issues could potentially jeopardize their relationship.Shortly after the plane takes off, Lloyd comforts Diane, who fears flying. Lloyd tells her that they just need to wait for the 'ding' because once that sounds they will know that everything is going to be okay. They anxiously anticipate the sound and the screen cuts to black just at the 'ding' is heard. I understand the metaphor, and it's a good one. I was merely disappointed that we were not given a chance to view Lloyd and Diane in their new life together. This new atmosphere could have created endless conflict and watchable circumstances. Regardless, the movie was excellent and very much worth a watch.",Say Anything

75,quinimdb,Say Anything...,7,22 March 2016,"My favorite part about ""Say Anything..."" is how it treats it's characters. They feel genuine, like real people, not like archetypes like in most teen movies (I love ""The Breakfast Club"", but literally every character in that movie is an archetype). There is no nerd or jock character, and their dialogue doesn't feel like movie dialogue. The chemistry between the characters is (intentionally) awkward at first, but as they come to know each other better it becomes more relaxed and natural. Lloyd is not a perfect guy, he gets easily anxious, isn't very smart, and has absolutely no idea where he is going in life (but he doesn't seem to care). But he also has good intentions and is easy to like. Diane is VERY connected to her dad, and her dad try's to plan out her life for he because he ""wants her to have everything"". But this results in her not really having much of a social life, which pretty much leads to her decision to go to the party on the night of their graduation with Lloyd. At first she doesn't like Lloyd, and it seems she even thinks about ditching him at one point, but from talking to one of Lloyd's best friends she decides to give him a chance.All of the characters in this movie end up learning one thing: no matter how much you plan for something, a simple feeling that you have for someone can completely change it, so really, you can't plan for anything. Diane's dad, James, is arrested later in the movie for essentially stealing money from people, and his plan to raise money for when his daughter comes back from England is completely foiled. Even though Diane thinks it's best for her not to be with Lloyd, she inevitably comes back to him. Lloyd has the easiest time adjusting, because he had no preconceived plans. He simply focuses on the moment and I think thats the lesson of this movie. No matter how much you plan for your life, anything can swoop in and change that plan at any moment, so we might as well just stay closest to the people we care about and just worry about things as they come. And the closet we get to realizing that, the happier everyone's lives will be.",Say Anything

77,Panterken,Doesn't meet my requirements that define a 'good movie'. Just average.,6,16 September 2007,"I'm not a big fan of and do not have a lot of knowledge about romantic films but it seems to me 'Say Anything' is just a mediocre film, nothing special really. I can't really identify with the '80's atmosphere since I'm a 90's ( and '00's) kid but I can see why this film can be nostalgia for some people. This being known as one of the best teen romances of the '80's makes me not want to see the others. It was fine but wasn't rewarding enough, didn't leave enough to ponder on after the credits were rolling. I guess I'm just saying 'Say Anything' didn't meet my requirements, it didn't fulfill any of the criteria of what makes a movie better than average according to me. I expect something special when watching, watching the same formulaic films every time leaves me yearning for more.'Say Anything' isn't a bad movie, the acting's decent, the on screen chemistry's good, the plot is a little thin but OK. It's a great film for fans of the '80's teen film genre, can bring back a lot of teenage or childhood memories and so it's worth the watch for people who meet the fore-mentioned standards.I'm a pretty big Cusack fan, have been ever since watching Runaway Jury, and I've been searching for more movies of his. Sadly, this is probably the worst film he's made that I've seen so far. Cusack's the reason I gave this film a 5.5, because everything else makes me want to give this film a 5. Just to clarify, a 5 is a mediocre movie in my book, not a bad one. I've given plenty of critically acclaimed movies 4 or less.Decent, not good enough.",Say Anything

Example Singles, Fast times at Ridgemont high and of course Jerry Maguire. Also interesting is that this was a Drama breakthrough for John Cusak.I do not want to give to much away. But basically the story is about a young man's romantic quest for a girl he has admired for a long time.

The film opens at Lloyd's high school graduation where, on a whim, he asks the class brain, Diane (Ione Skye) to be his date for a graduation party and they are both equally shocked when she accepts his invitation and before the evening is over,he is head over heels in love with her. The only problem is that she's going to college in London in the fall so Lloyd has decided to win her heart before she leaves. To say more would ruin the film, but know that John Cusack gives the performance of a lifetime as Lloyd, an utterly charming rogue who no girl should have trouble falling in love with. Skye is charming as Diane and John Mahoney gives a great performance as Diane's Dad.

Classy acting from a fairly youthful ensemble, fine scripting and direction, and just some incredibly memorable scenes combine to give this movie some incredible emotional pull.

83,quiqueperezsoler,"While ground-breaking to the genre, low-key and therefore at times underwhelming in its realistic approach at a young pure-love story. Leaves you wanting more out of them",6,24 April 2020,"Sincere, personal and touching without a doubt but in retrospective modest and restrained in the execution of what it's trying to say. The movie is filled with real heartbreaking and heartfelt moments that compells the audience to root for the young couple who against all odds want to be together. Nevertheless, throughout it the reasons it uses to sell on that relationship fall flat due to a lack of context and repressed characterization.Back then with all the romanticised teen movies that while some were whimsical and flashy (in an amusing way) others, like this, provided a deeper and more realistic view to the different pressures (parent and peer) that began to give meaning to the concept of ""teenage angst"" that became so popular in the 90s for the genre. Movies like ""The Breakfast Club (1985)"" and ""Sixteen Candles(1984)"", and others that while amusing hid deeper messages about coping with loss, fear of the future and social issues regarding the way high school life worked.""Say Anything..."" was one of the precursors of those realistic ""out there"" takes of a romance with very particular family and friend situations that allowed more mature themes to come to play. This movie has interesting set-ups and interactions but as the story unfolds it seems as it skips the important character-developing moments we would like to see in order to empathise more with the leads.Unfortunately, the movie deprives us of the high school setting as the movie begins in their graduation so we never get a feeling of why the people around them comment on their relationship's fruition. We grow fond of John Cusack's friends as we understand their basic backstory but the only thing we really learn about both leads are simply what they say (an exposition dump) and we hardly see their feelings through their actions except on very few occasions that through time have become iconic. John Cusack's character portrayal lead us to believe he is shy and nervous at the beginning around Ione Skye's character due not only to his fear of botching the relationship but due also to her status as valedictorian but after they meet he behaves the same way, always unsure and never providing that warm security found in the getting-to-know-each-other phase in order for the relationship's ever-arriving crisis to have the wrecking impact needed. Some say this is because the movie stays true to reality and prevents the situation of becoming overly-romanticised, and indeed that might be the reason, but it takes it so far that we don't ever get the feeling that the problem was never really that big to begin with because while the ""roller-coaster of emotion""-formula in other teen movies might be gimmicky the reason why it works is because it's true to how feelings work in real relationships.The couple had cute and believable interactions. They share believable moments of distress created by the events that unfold but due to a lack of comedic moments to ease up the tension and break the monotony the movie never seemed to have a moment of fun. It is low-key, calm and quiet, a welcomed attribute to an, at times, flashily-saturated genre. While some might appreciate that take on a teen romance, I personally am more fond of a little ""hot-blooded"" take at unrequired or forbidden love stories. It feels restrained as if too careful for their characters not to get too uninspired and overreact to the very alarming scenarios they are put through. John Cusack's motivation to stick with Ione Skye was also very underwhelming, granted his character was sort of a slacker and angsty towards the capitalistic professional world but his reason to stay with her is just a bit uninspired.IN CONCLUSION, the movie is a classic of the time, it provides and endearing love story of two different people that must confront the reality of the situation they are living. It has great performances but lacking better writting that could have allowed them to bounce off each other to make the difficult moments more impactful and the eventual course-correction more satisfying and fulfilling. Perhaps I watched it with the wrong mindset thus feeling underwhelmed when it ended, perhaps I expected either an whimsical-romantic or a sadly-deep coming of age teen movie and instead was delighted with a mismatch of both. However, it is a must-see for fans of 80s teen romance movies and a classic late 80s love story.",Say Anything

85,MRavenwood,"Hard to Place this Movie in any Genre Besides ""Good Movie""",9,26 September 2006,"I've never cared for ""teen movies"" and this *isn't* one, so don't worry. On the surface, this movie would appear to be about high school, or growing up, or the 'loser' guy dares to get the 'winner' girl. This movie is about truthfulness and it's liberating qualities and also about the price one pays for success or greatness.Diane Court is the valedictorian and the ""most likely to succeed"" in her high school. Lloyd Dobler is the well-liked underachiever with good character. Lloyd's low-pressure friends accept Diane at a party and she, at last, gets to let her hair down. This launches a romance that Diane's father disdains.Always quick to shower her with praise, encouragements, and gifts Diane's father has visions of her earth-shattering success. On her part, Diane is getting a little self-conscious over her father's incessant chatter about what HE wants her to be.Lloyd's attentions to Diane grow inconvenient to her father perhaps less for his romantic interest, but worse: he's diverting her from her greatness. Simultaneously, Lloyd has no outward indicators of achievement. He lacks direction and can't really say what his next moves are. Diane's father's agitation grows when investigators from the IRS launch a criminal investigation of him. The acting in this film is so believable you feel like you are in the movie yourself. John Mahoney (the father)makes this role look so easy and his face conveys every emotion so clearly. John Cusack nails this role as the anxious-to-please, smitten teen with a sincere heart. His dialog sounds very natural. Ione Skye is lucky. Not many female rolls for teenage girls are as juicy as this one: no nudity, no ax murderers, and no entering into talent competitions. Additional endorsement: I danced with a naval officer from a nuclear sub to the main theme of this film and he immediately asked me if I had seen this film.

86,teejayniles2345,A film that dares to show regular folks,10,29 October 2001,"I am a big fan of Writer/Director Cameron Crowe.  He was handed an OSCAR for the equally profound script (original) for Almost Famous (2000) at the Academy Awards this past March.  This film is also praiseworthy for showing regular folks' pitfalls, setbacks, and persistence.  The film actually shows a ""Designated Driver"" as needed and fitting in the social circle when Lloyd is drafted as ""Keymaster.""  The two lovers in SAY ANYTHING both have their rough edges but are committed to each other, regardless of the Dollar $ign$ that most people have as the ultimate ""bottom line.""  The parents of teens are shown as ""best bud- wannabe"" or ""out in distant left field"" which leads to joys and frustrations on both sides of the parent-child relationship. Crowe catches a great song ""IN YOUR EYES"" as performed by Peter Gabriel and uses it to maximum potential in the film.  I've never been to Seattle but seeing it as a backdrop in this highly memorable work was quite an enticement.  Taking a risk with life means that you dare to lose a lot, but the open-ended conclusion allows us to view the couple as just getting a start from that summer of true love.

In Say Anything, the characters are well developed and the story keeps pace very well.  Cusack does what he does with great ease.  I think he must have fallen in and out of love 7 or 8 times in order to play the part so well.

92,TYLERdurden74,Cult Movies 2,9,6 November 1998,"2. SAY ANYTHING (comedy-romance, 1989) Lloyd (John Cusak) is graduating from high school. His main interests in life include kick-boxing, and having fun. Diane (Ione Skye) is the smart and beautiful genius of Lloyd's school, so he calls her up for a date. She accepts only ""because he made me laugh"". Since they lead very different lives, it comes as a surprise to all when the no-so serious Lloyd gets Diane to fall in love with him. But Diane suddenly has to decide whether to leave for an exclusive college, or stay with the man she loves.CRITIQUE: Starting out as another one of those 'sex-teen' comedies that were popular during the 1980s (i.e. 'Meatballs', 'Porky's'), the film surprisingly settles down to a wonderful coming-of-age romance. Cameron Crowes' witty script and direction helps to lift it above those inferior flicks. He gives the characters clever lines (""so how did you get Diane to go out with you?"" Lloyd: ""I called her up"". ""Thanks, that gives me hope""), along with a story that touches on the complicated aspects of young love.It also examines their emotions and thoughts as young adults, not just sex-starved teens full of hormones. Best of all, Crowe gives the oftentimes-miscast John Cusak a perfect role. His on-screen romance with the beguiling Ione Skye has to be one of the sweetest in cinema memory.QUOTES: Diane: ""Why are you shaking?"" Lloyd: ""I don't know. I'm just happy.""",Say Anything
93,mrtimlarabee,Enter Cameron Crowe,10,10 August 2009,"I love all of Cameron Crowe's movies. He's a master screenwriter that injects heart and smarts in the traditional rom-com and crafts characters that anyone can relate to. When you go see a traditional romantic comedy, the target audience is usually women. ""Say Anything"" has Lloyd Dobler. Besides being the nice guy girls like, he's an honest strong willed dreamer. He's cool but not in the typical tall dark and handsome cool but in the outsider, marches to his own beat cool. He's very nontraditional for the genre and an example of why Crowe triumphs in his films.Diane Court is also atypical. She's the good looking ""brain,"" who is not really popular at school, as is traditionally found in teen rom coms. She's also torn between what she wants and what her father wants. Her father's questionable dealings with a nursing home he runs also creates a serious situation for Diane. She deals with her decisions post high school, her father, and her love for Lloyd. That Crowe creates such complex conflicts for Diane in 100 minutes is nothing short of brilliant direction and screen writing.This was Cameron Crowe's directorial debut and was a very promising one. It's still my favorite film of his if for no other reason than John Cusack delivers some of the beautifully written dialogue so well. But it IS so much more. ""Say Anything"" came at the end of the 80s. Teenagers grew up with the characters in John Hughes films, dealing with those high school problems. I love those films and love how ""Say Anything"" provided the wonderful afterthought to those films. Life after high school, dealing with our parents vs. our own desires and coming into our own as adults. ""Say Anything"" is often cited as a teen romantic comedy, often mentioned in the same breath of many high school romcoms. Yet the graduation and party are just a small tiny bit of the film. Crowe's characters are deeper than that. The story, dialogue, and acting helped jump-start Cameron Crowe's career yet is still my favorite of his films.",Say Anything
94,carljessieson,One of the Sweetest Movies I have ever Seen,8,6 September 2010,"I bought this movie after hearing many times about its famous boom box scene, and I do not regret it at all. It's a lovely film with a simple plot and sincere characters. It's one of the classic '80s films that should never be forgotten.I believe the best thing about this movie is the lead character, Lloyd Dobbler. I love him; he is the sweetest movie character that comes to my mind right now. He was so well-establishedJohn Cusack did a really spectacular job portraying him. If Lloyd were real I would love to date him. I know for sure I would not like this movie without him.His lover in the film, however, was not so impressive. I didn't really like her too much, but it seems like her interactions with other characters in the story and the descriptions of those who knew her were meant to show her as a like-able presence. To me, this is a failure. I thought she was boring, confusing at times, and annoying. I just didn't like her. I believe she is the only problem with the film, and I think she is what's keeping me from making the jump from liking this movie to loving it. Too bad.Another aspect of this film that I really liked were the extra characters, like Lloyd's friends and fellow high school graduates at the house party. They were really funny to me, and much more interesting to watch than Diane Court. His friend's obsession with Joe was really fun, haha. I loved it.The plot is simple- it's mainly the blossoming love between two teenagers and seeing if it will survive through the devastating drama of finding out a beloved father could be criminal. It's cute, easy to follow. The music is great, peppy '80s. I liked the dialogue, mainly just Lloyd's though. Everything he said felt so genuine and sweet. I loved every time he talked.So pretty much, I really like this movie a lot. Very rarely do I see a film where I wish I could date someone in it, but this is definitely one.

95,ElmStreetsLastBrat,Awesome!,8,11 February 2007,"I loved ""Say Anything"". This is an awesome movie. I'm a fan of 80s romantic comedies anyway but this one was more sweet and poignant than it was a comedy I believe. John Cusack plays Lloyd Dobler, a free spirit with no goals in life who has just graduated high school. He falls for Diane Cort (Ione Skye), the career driven valedictorian who is about to go off to college. They begin a relationship after Lloyd calls her and they go to a party. Diane ends up enjoying herself more than she thought she would and falls for Lloyd. The movie basically showcases Lloyd and Diane's relationship during the summer before Diane leaves. They make up, break up, begin a physical relationship, have parent drama, make up, break up, and suffer much heartbreak. But just when you think it's over for good and you think that Lloyd just doesn't want anything to do with Diane even though she won't give up on him, the two find a way to bring each other back. There are several scenes where Diane is so confused about her feelings toward Lloyd but deep down you know she truly loves him. You realize that it's just her father's personal and financial troubles that are getting in the way of hers and Lloyd's relationship. The boombox scene was a classic and it was so sweet. You cannot find that particular scene duplicated in any other film. It truly stands out. And another scene that really stands out is the scene where Lloyd and Diane are in the backseat of his car. It is just precious. I love this movie and I'm glad I bought it. I had never seen it and I saw it on sale and decided to buy it. It is a great film and should be viewed by anyone who is a fan of 80s romantic comedies or fans of John Cusack, or just fans of romantic comedies in general.

I don't think I have ever been dissapointed in one of his films, and this one is another winner.  This movie is a little less of a comedy than some of his others, but follows the basic formula of; having the girl, losing the girl, and trying to get her back.  No real belly laughs, but there are some chuckles in the movie.  The movie delivers on the romantic sentimentality. The relationships are a little more mature than typical High School romances.  Lloyd isn't trying to get to second base with his dream girl, he knows he is in love with her, he is trying to get her forever.  The girl lives with her father, and of course, the father wants nothing but the best for the daughter, which doesn't include Lloyd.  But, this conflict is also mature.

99,unbend_5440,In some ways it's still Cameron Crowe's best,10,3 October 2002,"I saw Say Anything for the first time four or five years ago while flipping through channels. I thought it was going to be some dopey teen movie, and the only reason I watched it was because it had John Cusack and was directed by Cameron Crowe. I had no idea how perfect this movie really was. When I say perfect, I mean it is perfect. I can't think of one thing wrong with it.Upon just hearing the storyline, most people would think Say Anything was just another stereotypical teen movie. In reality, I think Say Anything is the ANTI-TEEN MOVIE. It's a love story between two characters who are completely different. The girl is smart and serious and doesn't have much of a social life. The guy is a bit of a jock, really cool, and a kickboxer. There's one thing that makes Say Anything different from all other films that seems so similar. What makes it different is how real the movie is. None of the dialogue is forced or overdone. It's all written so realistically. You could almost imagine that Cameron Crowe just set up a tape recorder around a bunch of people and wrote the script based on the words that came out of their mouth. Say Anything is totally believable as a real life story (it probably helps that part of it is based on Crowe's own life).For anyone that's a fan of John Cusack, you must drop everything you're doing and rent this movie RIGHT NOW! Cusack has never topped his performance as Lloyd in Say Anything. Cusack is hilarious when he delivers his long nervous rambling monologues. He's universally cool when he does his back and forth horse-around scenes with the young actor who plays his nephew. But perhaps Cusack's best acting in this movie comes when he doesn't have any lines at all. I'm talking about his one shot close up while holding a stereo over his head, playing the Peter Gabriel song ""In Your Eyes"". Even after 13 years, it's still one of the all time greatest movie moments.Cameron Crowe is an amazing director, but an even better screenwriter. His brilliant script is what really makes Say Anything work.

Lloyd doesn't even know what he wants to do now that he's out of high school, while Diane has it all figured out. She even received, and accepted, a fellowship to attend college in England. Though they both know this, Lloyd and Diane begin to get pretty serious, and end up falling in love. However, Diane's father James (John Mahoney) soon becomes wound up in financial problems, and Diane decides that, with all the trouble and her leaving soon to England, it would be best for her and Lloyd to split up. This decision devastates the both of them, but maybe it ends up being for the best... or maybe not.SAY ANYTHING... could very well be the best romantic comedy I've ever seen. It's actually more of a romantic drama than a comedy, but whatever. Instead of most modern romantic comedies that are about nothing more than puppy love, this film instead focuses on real love and strong bonds and relationships. The story is extremely sweet, almost so much so that it would have made an inevitably cheesy movie, but it didn't. It's carried out perfectly, and I literally can't find a single flaw in the execution. There are tons of memorable scenes, namely the classic boombox scene, which is incredibly sweet and touching and even made me cry.The acting in this movie is exceptional. John Cusack is absolutely perfect as the hero Lloyd, creating the movie's most likable character, and I'm sure he made many women wish they could find a guy just like him. Ione Skye and James Mahoney also put in wonderful performances, and many of the members of the supporting cast are good and fun as well. But I definitely think Lloyd steals the show.In short, SAY ANYTHING... is, in my opinion, one of the best romantic comedies made so far, and certainly the best one I've ever seen. The story is timeless and sweet, and hopefully will hold up as the definitive classic it has been regarded as. 8.5/10.",Say Anything
101,angelabox,This movie well and truly sucks.,1,2 September 2019,"Everyone who likes this movie saw it when they were juniors in high school and are romanticizing it as adults.It sucks. Hard.The funny thing is, my sister and I were talking about Say Anything just the other day and I mentioned I had never seen it. She was mortified I had gone through not only my teens but also my adulthood never experiencing the glory of the iconic boombox scene.As my unlucky circumstances would have it, it was one of the movies on an Alaska Airlines flight, so I watched it today.When we finally arrived at THE scene, it was such a letdown. This is IT?! THIS painfully bad display was what made girls cry and guys unoriginally imitate to try and get the crying girls?!The plot and characters are thin, undeveloped, and disjointed. I kept waiting for something unexpected or NOT mind-numbingly boring to happen and it never did.Ione Skye cannot act. John Cusack was trying really hard not to bust into Lane Meyer mode and frankly that would've made Lloyd more interesting. Give me SOMETHING, John. John Mahoney could've been so much better.The best thing about this awful piece of garbage is the kid who plays Lloyd's nephew. Now HE was funny. It was also neat to see younger versions of Joan Cusack, Lili Taylor, Bebe Neuworth, Eric Stoltz, and Jeremy Piven with his real hair.Say Anything is seriously one of the biggest pieces of crap I have ever seen.Do yourself a favor and do NOT watch it as an adult.",Say Anything
102,SanTropez_Couch,"Ultra-charming, the height of '80s teen movies",10,5 April 2003,"John Cusack is one of the most enjoyable actors alive. It's a shame that he's most well-known from semi-terrible action movies like ""Con Air"" (worth watching for an amazing cast -- Steve Buscemi, Nicolas Cage having fun with a bad southern accent, Ving Rhames, and John Malkovich chomping the scenery) and so-sweet-they'll-make-your-teeth-rot romantic comedies. When he's in a good, even great, role as he is here, the pleasures he brings are endless.The so true tagline of the movie is: ""To know Lloyd Dobler is to love him. Diane Court is about to know Lloyd Dobler."" Cusack plays Lloyd Dobler as an optimistic, verbose charmer of a 19 year-old longing for Diane Court (Ione Skye). Diane is an overachiever -- not a snob, but she's afraid that people see her as ""prissy."" In the film, we never see her with her friends; rather, we see her working at her father's (John Mahoney) old folks home. Dobler, on the other hand, we see with his friends like the great Lily Taylor, as a forlorn girl who sings Angry Chick music -- 65 songs written about the guy who dumped her. (She encourages Dobler to be a man, not just some ""guy."")Diane's not a long-legged blonde or a bombshell by any means, but she is cute. She's a social outcast of sorts. While she's been accepted by a fellowship in England, she doesn't have a clue socially. When she reluctantly agrees to go out to an after-graduation party with Dobler (after one of the all-time classic phone calls, in a constraining bathroom space), she overdresses terribly for the occasion. Dobler isn't a stud, but he's instantly likeable and spending time with his presence is a joy.As Diane's father, John Mahoney gives a subtle, hopelessly un-hip portrayal of an emotionally open father whose pride is his daughter (and will do whatever he can to secure her happiness). At first, he's indifferent towards Lloyd, although he does question Lloyd's career prospects (just as Lloyd's friends question why Diane is interested in him at all). In the most heartbreaking and perfectly handled scene in the movie, the divorced Mahoney tries to pull a Lloyd Dobler and charm a store clerk, only to have two credit cards denied, and have the clerk pity him by saying she won't confiscate his card as she's supposed to.I've always had an affection for '80s teen movies (even though -- or maybe because -- I'm too young to remember them first first-hand). Many of them -- particularly those by the King of '80s teen movies, John Hughes -- have a strange self-awareness and a weirdness that's really unique. The two reining favourites remain ""The Breakfast Club"" and ""Ferris Bueller's Day Off,"" both by Hughes. But ""Say Anything..."" wasn't a John Hughes movie, it was Cameron Crowe's first as a director. It doesn't have that weirdness of many '80s teen movies; instead, it's got an honest charm (as opposed to, I don't know, a goofball charm). It's genuinely funny (Cusack's dead-on timing is a major asset), and ultimately the perfect date movie. The only thing I'd worry about is your date falling in love too much with Lloyd and his bumbling eloquence. After watching ""Say Anything...,"" she might see you as second rate.There's one scene in the back of a car (yep, you guessed it) that seems as if it were directly thieved by James Cameron for his vastly overrated (but sill enjoyable) ""Titanic."" (I know it's not just some coincidence either -- there's more than one Bob Dylan line stolen and reworded for Cameron's film.) Also, I'm fairly certain that The Simpsons paid homage to ""Say Anything..."" and Diane's fear of flying, in an episode where Marge is calmed by Homer, naming all the completely ordinary plane noises. (Diana also retells a story in the film of how she screamed so loud that she and her father made a plane turn around -- in The Simpsons, it's actually shown.)In this, one of the great romantic-teen-comedies -- a masterwork, and Crowe's crowning achievement with ""Almost Famous"" trailing close behind -- it's great fun getting to know Lloyd Dobler.****",Say Anything

I already owned ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" (okay, he didn't direct it, but he wrote it) and ""Jerry Maguire"", so next I rented ""Say Anything ..."".""Say Anything ..."" begins with Lloyd Dobler, a kind, well-liked underachiever who falls in love with Diane Court, a straight-A student who has just been accepted into a college in England. Lloyd wins Diane's affections after he takes her to a late-night party - but winning the approval of her father is a completely different matter.Cameron Crowe is certainly a talented filmmaker. ""Say Anything ..."" was his directorial debut and third screenplay. It's one of those special 80's teen romantic comedies that is even more magical today than it was back in '89. As is typical with Cameron Crowe's films, ""Say Anything"" has a terrific soundtrack. The film also has a sort of laid-back, observational style of directing, with mixes well with the intelligent, funny script.The casting is superb. John Cusack is - well, awesome as Lloyd Dobler. Ione Skye does a fine job of showing the confliction that Diane feels. And John Mahoney is perfect as Diane's loving, protective father.The film has some great scenes. The second ""In Your Eyes"" scene is definitely one of the movie's greatest and most famous moments. Anyone who's seen the film will attest to the fact that it's a very memorable movie. And it has a great ending too! ""Say Anything ..."" is a marvelous movie, and definitely one of my favorites. It's well-written, -acted and -directed. It's moving, dramatic, and very funny. If you're searching for a sweet, well-made, romantic comedy, look no further than ""Say Anything ..."".(NOTE: My family recently purchased a Surround system, and ""Say Anything ..."" was one of the first films I watched with it. The movie sounds FANTASTIC. If you have a Surround system, prepare for a great experience.)",Say Anything

Maybe I tried too hard, because the movie fell short of capturing me. Granted, I'm bitter and cynical about love, but some movies can ""break"" me, as it were. 	It was almost as if the plot created a relationship that was improbable in its conception, but got a little too good. They had to slap together a way to make that mid-film falling out, and it didn't quite work. The controversy with her dad's business created more drama in Diane's life than perhaps it should have, and created an unwanted dragging effect 3/4 of the way through. Not as funny as Cusack's mid-80's outings, but has its moments. Still worth the 3 bucks I paid to rent it. 6/10",Say Anything

On the surface a simple love story, but it goesmuch deeper and deals with keeping your heart and hope alive in the faceof difficult times with family, something we can all relate too. Filledwith wonderful cameos, including Jeremy Piven and Joan Cusack and LiliTaylor and Eric Stoltz (an alum from Fast Times!), this is one of thefew heartfelt studio films made in the last 20 years.

107,saprater,Romantic Masterpiece,10,12 November 2003,"I rented this movie solely based on the excellent reviews that it has gotten everywhere.  I missed it during its theatrical release (as so many others did) and had the hardest time finding a copy of it at our local video rental stores.  Not because it wasn't popular but b/c, according to the clerks, people kept stealing or ""losing"" their copies...especially around Valentines Day.  When I finally got my hands on a copy I was blown away.  I had thought this was going to be just another in a long link of Pretty in Pinkish movies with predictable characters and a bad case of puppy love, but what I got was a surprisingly refreshing, unconventional story with a complicated and well-developed emotional depth flawlessly captured by the actors and Cameron Crowe.And talk about role reversals!  I'm so used to seeing the man take the assertive and mature role while courting a woman of limited financial or intellectual means...but in this film it's the girl that's got her future together and the guy who's more than willing to concentrate his attention on making her happy.  And Lloyd Dobler isn't just a shiftless man with no future.  He's an eternal optimist who lives in the present and recognizes, admires, and compliments the qualities in Diane that go beyond her amazing intellect.  She becomes his dare-to-be-great situation and his absolute love and devotion to her is anything but unmanly.  The force of it is palatable and immensely erotic without being reduced to cheap teenage lust.  The sight of Lloyd in the shadows defiantly blasting out the truth of their love through the boombox is a scene which would have seemed awkward and goofy in any other movie but this one.  It's easy to understand why even the critics of the time gave Say Anything two enthusiastic thumbs up.  This is one of the few films that really captures the feeling of love.",Say Anything

Lloyd is a 19 year old without a career path, but with an unflinching love of Diane Court, a beautiful genius.  It is John Cusack's ability to turn a well written character into one of the most empathetic and enjoyable characters in recent film that has made this such a wonderful movie experience.  Ione Skye is almost as strong as Diane Court, who doesn't overplay her intelligence, naiveté, or caring nature.  And John Mahoney is wonderful as Diane's father, a flawed man who loves his daughter, perhaps too much.  Overall, this is an intensely likable film about characters we care a great deal about, and in a story that is true and honest to its characters.",Say Anything

111,jdberkley,"One of the best, most optimistic movies about young people ever made(minor spoiler alert)...",10,27 August 2002,"You want to know why Cameron Crowe's ""Say Anything"" is such a tremendously popular and affecting film? There is a small scene late in the film, when Jim Court(played by John Mahoney) goes to buy luggage for his daughter's trip to England. Unfortunately, he can't because of a problem with his account, and after the embarrassing scene that results, the film cuts to a scene of him sitting in his bathtub, fully clothed, clearly struggling with a situation that's gotten out of hand.I mention it because Jim Court is posited as the antagonist in the burgeoning love affair between his daughter(the ravishing Ione Skye) and Lloyd Dobler, the fast-talking, kick-boxing kid who gets Diane to go out with him just by calling her up. 99 teen romance films out of 100 would go out of their way to paint a disapproving parent in the worst possible light, hoping to win our emotional support for the romance by showing what hurdles it must overcome. Cameron Crowe, though, is wise enough to realize it doesn't work like that-- love, especially young love, has plenty of obstacles of its own, and our parents might object, but they still love us, and their opinions ought to be valued. Jim Court does something very foolish, but the movie doesn't vilify him-- it paints him as a caring man who made a mistake out of love. That ability to empathize with every character is what makes Crowe such a gifted screenwriter, and that level of caring and insight into Lloyd, Diane, Jim, and the rest is what makes ""Say Anything"" one of the very best movies about young love that's ever been made.",Say Anything

Crowe is the best writer working in cinema today, even his worst flick Vanilla Sky had some great qoutes.  Anyways on to this particular film the movie is about Lloyd Daubler a hopeless clueless romantic played wonderfully by John Cusak, and Dianne Court a hot acheiver babe played by Ione Sky.  The wonder of the Cusack Charecter is that he has no idea what he wants to do at the age of 19, I mean hell I had no clue about what I wanted to do at that age and no one I knew had any real idea of what they wanted to do at that age.  He is played with wild insecurity by Cusack charming funny sweet and kind of bitter.  Sky plays Court as an insecure girl still uncertain about the world.  Her father played here by John Mahoney is the overprotective father taken to a huge extrene.  He tells his daugher she can so anything to him and he doesn't even had the nerve to tell his own daughter he is an embezelling crook.  This is a wonderful movie funny sad and poignant.

The plot itself involves an unlikely love story and a father who would keep them apart, but there are scenes in this movie that are mentioned over and over by people who have seen this movie. Everyone who sees it remembers the scene with the radio (which is all I can say, so as not to spoil it for others.)

It doesn't take long for Diane to fall for Lloyd, and he for her. The fly in the ointment is, of course, Diane's overprotective father, played with sympathetic brilliance by John Mahoney. I was surprised to learn that this was Cameron Crowe's debut movie as director. Surprised because his direction is so deft and assured, the editing damn near perfect, and the performances he gets out of every single person in the cast so wonderful.

For me, Casablanca is the greatest romance movie of all time, but running a close second for me is Cusack and Skye in Say Anything..., a movie that walks the thin line of being a teeny-bopper romance flick, a goofball comedy, and an insightful view on the relationships between a boy and girl. Say Anything... not only walks this line, but practically dances on it the way Gene Kelly would in Singin' in the Rain, with exhuberance, style, and an overall feeling of joy.The chemistry between John Cusack as the immortal Lloyd Dobbler and Ione Skye as the envious Diane Court is unlike any romance film made with in the past fifty to sixty years. Lately, romance films have been giving us chemistry, but no reason to get behind the lovers and want to see them blossom. This task is flawlessly handled by Cameron Crowe, who gives perfect definition as to why the couple should be together. They open new worlds to each other, he shows her a world outside of books like she's been used to and she, in return, realizes that he is more than some average joe with no recognizable future prospects. Apart, they are talented, but together, they're connection is luminous.I have seen this movie nearly one hundred times and have never tired of it. Not only is this a wonderful romance for the ages, but it is also a clever teenage film, showing the teens in this movie as deep, thoughtful, occasionally exaggerated, but we were all like that at that age, that's what sets them apart from the Freddie Prinze Jrs and Julia Stiles of today. The teens in movies today (outside of American Beauty) have become charicatures. In Say Anything..., they are a world within themselves and we become the priviliged tourists to take pictures as we pass by.Say Anything... is a cult classic now, but as history progresses and movies become video discs in a library some where in the distant future, this one should stand out like Jane Austin and William Shakespeare do today in that this movie analyzes the youth of our time and treats them with the respect and intelligence that they deserve. Kudos, Mr. Crowe, for bringing such a beautiful, heart-warming, optimistic, and overall brilliant piece of art into this world. To see it is to make your life that much brighter.*ding*",Say Anything
117,dark_elf02,THE guide to all future romantic teen movies,10,14 January 2004,"As we watch movies we search for the ones that we can truly identify with, whether its with certain characters or situations.  With Say Anything I was able to identify with everything in the movie characters and all.The plot for Say Anything is fairly standard, but its the details and nuances that make the movie one of the greatest of all time.  The script has such a freshness, and honesty that its impossible to brush it aside as a ""typical romantic teen comedy"". Instead it gives you truly believable characters going through very believable situations. Some of the most important points of the movie were some of the most honest and overlooked parts.  Like when Loyd and Diane make love for the very first time(for each of them as well)  loyd begins shaking and though he tries to deny he is, and then says its because he is happy that you see one of the reasons the movie is so great.  The break-up seen in the middle of the movie is so heart breaking that you almost want to reach out to loyd to try and help him and all of this movie and all are done with a script I wish most teen movies would have.  Its intelligent, funny, honest, and precisely written with all the characters being three-demensional even down to bits parts.  And the famous scene where loyd stands in front of his car and holds up his boom box with ""your eyes"" blasting out of it is one of the most memorable and great scenes of any movie. . . ever.John Cusak who is one of the most underrated actors of all time plays Loyd Dobbler with such  delicacy that you would not be surprised if he was just playing himself. Ione Skye is perfectly convincing as a girl who is as intelligent as she is beautiful(and she is very much both) who doesnt realize how beautiful she really is. The honesty with which both of these actors played and poured themselves into the roles are admirable. And if you really want to find out some more about this movie listen to the commentary by cusak, skye, and cameron crowe and you will find even more depth than you ever thought to this movie.

The story is simple and not made overly dramatic which is definitely a plus. I never tire of watching this movie and even see new things in the characters each time.

Seems to me that even though John Cusack is a very good actor, every character he played during the 80's was exactly the same. He always played the quirky, self effacing guy who dressed funny. This character is exactly the same as the dude he played in ""The Sure Thing."" In the scene where he's holding the ghetto blaster over his head, I was hoping someone would shoot it out of his hands. I liked him a lot better when he was an extra in John Hughes' movies.It's no wonder the girl's dad didn't want him around - what dad would want a 19 year old loser who's career goal is to be a kick boxer or his daughter's full time boyfriend to follow his daughter to England where she's going to be studying at a prestigious university? They should have made a sequel where they continue their relationship for a couple of months before the girl realizes what a loser this dork is and dumps him for an intelligent, ambitious guy she meets at university.Then, Cusack's character could have wandered around Europe for awhile, being a big baby and then joining the Army.

This is a wonderful movie that I just don't know how anyone can not absolutely love when they see it. John Cusack leads the way in a role he was born to play, the humble, loyal, kind, soft, gentile, uncertain, young man with a heart of gold: Lloyd Dobler. He is a likable kick-boxer with no idea about what his future may hold. It's wonderful to see a teenager like this one in a movie give a message that it's okay not to know what you want to do, as long as you go with your heart.Ione Skye is the sweet, smart, loving, warm, amorous, and don't forget, beautiful, Diane Court, who steals Lloyd's heart. She is the class valedictorian who wins a fellowship to study in England. John Mahoney is equally convincing as a loving, insightful, concerned, but overprotective father, James Court, who will do anything for his daughter, the latter which proves to be his undoing. He runs a nursing home and cares for people, but he has a dark secret that is revealed by the end of the movie.Lloyd is smitten by the beautiful Diane Court, he wants very badly to take her out. He is somewhat shy, and, as his friend points out, ""he has this nervous talking thing."" He calls Diane, and his persistence pays off, as she seems to like his wit and tenacity and agrees to go the big graduation party with him.This is where the movie really begins, and also where we begin to identify with the characters fears, feelings, and pain. Diane is thrilled to finally be a part of the social life she missed out on, yet sad that she kept everybody at a distance. She sees what she could have, and perhaps should have, been a part of. Lloyd is scared and uncertain about the future, with no career plans. Diane's father is feeling threatened that Lloyd will take his only daughter away from him.Diane begins to fall for Lloyd because she trusts him and feels safe with him (pay close attention to the scene where he drops her off at her house after the all night party). Lloyd admires Diane because he finds her interesting, smart, and beautiful. The only problem is, Diane's father doesn't approve of Lloyd. He has the typical father's reaction: no one is worthy of being with my daughter. What I loved about her father is that he isn't an idiotic parent who can't understand the feelings of his daughter or other teenagers. When Diane and Lloyd spend a night together, and she comes home late without calling, her father is upset and angry, but wise and caring enough to discuss the situation with his daughter.We later learn a secret about Diane's father, that I will not reveal, after the IRS comes knocking at his door. What made this aspect of the movie so insightful, was that it didn't make us hate Diane's father. It simply portrayed him as a good man who made a mistake. Sometimes good people can do bad things for a good reason. It doesn't make it right, but it makes it understandable. The movie makes that very clear.Say Anything's biggest strength, though, may be that it gives a subtle message about listening to your instincts. When Diane breaks up with Lloyd after being pressured by her father, we can see that she is going against her feelings. Lloyd seems to know this too, and makes a reference that she is just blindly following her father, and not her heart. This is one of the scenes that makes us fully aware Lloyd's inarticulate side, and how a lot of the time his words are being wrung from his emotions. We feel the pain that both of them are going through.Lloyd uses every tactic to get Diane back, from playing Peter Gabriel on his boom box outside her bedroom window, to long-winded (and funny) phone machine messages. Eventually, she has a change of heart, and realizes that Lloyd is everything she imagined, and her father is not. I liked when Diane went to defend her father, and an IRS agent she spoke with was kind enough to detach himself from the situation and give her advice. ""Don't let your father's business affect your life."" He later tells her, very kindly, if not very wisely, ""if I were you, I would take that fellowship."" When Lloyd finally wins Diane over, it is one of the film's sweetest moments, and we know that all will be well for this unlikely, wonderful pair. Perhaps the greatest line is spoken by Lloyd, when Diane tells him that nobody ever thought there relationship would work, and nobody gave it a chance, he replies: ""You've just described every great success story."" I loved that line, because it's the truth, and great writers can say it all with one line. Say Anything made me laugh, cry, and see what life is really about. It was released in the spring of 1989, the tale end of my high school career. This made me love it all the more because I could identify with teenagers and high school in the 1980's. How can you not love a movie like this? What a gem of a film.",Say Anything

And here, 18 years later, it stands the test of time, and is partly such a joy because it contains so many performances from actors we've all grown to know and love. I especially like the twist of how Diane's dad earns his living. But the real star of this film is the ever-so-young John Cusack, with whom I've fallen in love somewhere between this film and Ice Harvest (not to worry though - I'm not THAT kind of wacky; no restraining orders necessary). There are so many noteworthy performers and performances here; I cried a lot, and quite unexpectedly. It even has a cute ending.Hollywood seems to be very fond of the I, II and III (ad nauseum) versions of a number of its products; this film ought to have had a follow up (and if it does and I simply don't know, well then, my goof), but hey, you're all still around and it's not too late, is it??? I hope that more people will check out this film; I can't believe I didn't watch it sooner, being such a fan of the Cusack clan (Joan, your role may have been small, but you looked especially lovely in this role).

Amidst deciding on his future and a protective father, Lloyd tries to do all he can to win over Diane before she heads off for college. 'Say Anything' is written and directed by Cameron Crowe, best known for his work on 'Almost Famous' and 'Jerry Maguire'.Cusack and Skye's chemistry in this film is some of the best ever on screen. Their on-screen chemistry really draws viewers into their relationship and makes the viewer feel so many emotions. All throughout the film the audience can relate and can not help but feel touched by these characters. This is definitely one of Cusack's best performances in his career. John Mahoney's performance as Diane's father James, is very great as well. His on-screen presence is very powerful and the viewer will feel many emotions towards him as well.This film is written almost perfectly. Every line is greatness and this film holds such memorable quotes. Along with memorable quotes, the film delivers heart-warming, memorable moments that viewers will fall in love with. Some of the best moments and quotes in cinema history came from this film. Great job by Crowe on writing and directing this film.The score in this film is done pretty well. Costume design is good, it serves its purpose. Cinematography is noting special. Editing is done pretty average. Ultimately this film boils down to great writing and performances.'Say Anything' is a great 80's classic that most anyone can fall in love with. With memorable quotes and events in this film, it is a movie that will stick with the viewer forever. Given one of the best on-screen chemistries in cinema history and great writing, 'Say Anything' gets a solid 8/10 stars from me.",Say Anything
130,alan_wyper,Nice Guy Gets Nice Girl,6,7 February 2007,"I happened across this film whilst channel-hopping, and decided to watch it with absolutely zero expectations. Given my usual aversion to any film described as a ""teen romance"", it may be that I was just in a good mood, but to my surprise I rather enjoyed it.A large part of its appeal undoubtedly lies in the fact that John Cusack and Ione Skye do make a genuinely likable couple, helped out by an understated script that allows them to be just that. In a number of other films by Cameron Crowe, I've felt the emotion was cloyingly overdone. However, although ""Say Anything"", with its central premise of ""nice guy gets nice girl"", occasionally teeters on the brink of such sentimentality, it never quite topples.There's a pleasant naturalistic quality to the film. Not what you would call realism, just an unforced emotional sincerity. Despite the fact many of the characters could, on the face of it, easily be slotted into familiar stereotypes of the genre, the script ensures they diverge just enough to keep things interesting.This is particularly true of Ione's father, engagingly played by John Mahoney, better known as Marty Crane on Frasier. At first I assumed he was going to be the standard domineering dad, putting his foot down to prevent his darling daughter consorting with a guy who just wasn't good enough for her. And to an extent this does happen, but it is all a good deal more subtle and nuanced than I had been expecting.Elsewhere, the film could be accused of leaving a number of the supporting characters underdeveloped, and some of the subplots unconcluded. Yet I actually didn't really mind. If anything it helped add a kind of authenticity to the story. After all in reality people can drift in and out of our lives quite haphazardly, without providing us with in depth looks into their character, nor any neat endings for their stories.In summation then, although ""Say Anything"" is no cinematic masterpiece, if you approach it in a relatively uncynical frame of mind, you should find it an engaging and sincere romantic drama.",Say Anything

At first I was like ""oh, just another John Cusack romantic comedy"" but Say Anything is so much more! It is definitley his best role to date as the scruffy but good hearted Lloyd. He may not be the smartest or most talented guy in the world, but he knows how to treat the people he loves with undying respect. The chemistry he had with the girl who played Diane was heartbreaking! The dialouge is great, as is the overall storyline, with wonderful characters and hilarious and sad moments that you'll never forget.

Maybe the script should give him another profession.

135,gscheyd,charming but confused little story,6,14 June 2006,"I can appreciate trying to work outside the boundaries of a genre, but it appears that Crowe meant for this to be a comedy of sorts, then thought better of it, or couldn't quite make up his mind, and ended up with a rather confused style. Still, as confused films go, this is one of the better ones. Perhaps I am being too critical, and the problem is not so much with the style as with my expectations. I was looking for something rather silly (in the vein of Sixteen Candles or Better Off Dead). What I found was dramatically different. The pacing is different, as is the film itself (by which I mean the actual type of film on which the scenes were recorded) with the outcome seeming rather like a disorganized British television program. Not what I expected at all. In any event, if the goal was comedy, the movie is a colossal failure in that respect (a la Silver Streak, The Frisco Kid, Being There), but there is one particularly funny line in the movie that bears emphasis. Cusack's character has had his heart broken. We see him driving around alone, speaking (notes to self) into a tape recorder and trying to make sense of it all. He decides to seek advice from the guys who hang out outside the ""Gas N Sip"". They dispense their advice, and the whole interaction turns out to be a waste of time. Then we cut to Cusack back in the car and speaking, deadpan, into his tape recorder, ""That was a mistake."" The editing and the delivery of the line are perfect, and this is clearly the biggest laugh in the movie, but the line could also have been referring to Crowe's decision to have three of the (very white) guys in that scene do a rap. This was very big in movies in 1989, but that was a mistake. More generally, the music in the movie is very bad, or at least the original music is. It's hard to ignore. But ""Take Five"" and ""In Your Eyes"" are both very good songs in my opinion, and are featured (the latter quite unforgettably) in the film as well. The use of rain during the crying scene is a bit tired ""Hey, let's try In Cold Blood. All the critics loved that,"" but maybe it was the best thing to cover up Cusack's weakness at acting very sad. And Ione Skye is just not a particularly good actress, period. One other thing  Cusack plays one of these characters who speaks like he's under the balcony with Cyrano at his ear. Naturally, this detracts from the plausibility of the character, but if you can suspend your disbelief about that little detail, it's very easy to enjoy this movie. It's not great, but it's worth a look. It's a little charming, rather quirky, mostly disorganized, but not bad  the overall quality is par for the course for a directorial debut from a talented filmmaker such as Cameron Crowe.",Say Anything
136,megomez,The best :),10,10 October 2003,"I am so glad to see the wonderful praise and love for this movie.  I saw it as a teenager and fell in love.  With John Cusack, Cameron Crowe, the movie in general....  And that's what this movie is all about---love :).  This movie is sweet. I am a lover of romances....and this is at the top of my list.  I have dreamt of directing..and if I did,I would specialize in romances...and God-willing I would make a movie as unique, and magic as this. Cameron Crowe is one of my very favorite directors..and my love-affair with his movies all began here in 1989, the year before I graduated from high school.  There are so many scenes in this movie that are incredible. I so wish John Cusack could make another romance like this one, but I guess they are hard to come by, one in a million.  Since this movie, I have not found another movie that has brought out the incredible endearment of John Cusack.  Maybe he should work with his old pal Cameron again!!  I miss those wonderful love scenes...and the comedy!!!  I think, even myself a girl, I imitate Cusack in this movie..some of the lines...so beautiful! When the thought ""What is your favorite movie?"" comes to mind, Say Anything has a special place there in my heart next to some pretty priceless company. Sometimes magic, true love, comes in the least expected places...this movie was supposedly ""a sleeper,"" a movie not lit up in flashing lights, etc., etc.,....lovers of this movie are sort of part of a special club, people who have had the fortune to discover this seemingly regular movie...a hidden treasure.  If you have not seen it, go for it...and my wish is that you find that hidden treasure too.  Actually, as soon as the movie starts rolling, there is nothing hidden about it...it is plain beautiful.  The magic of movies.  I rarely, rarely, rarely give a movie a 10/10....perfection...what is that?...but by the mere fact of how this movie has become a part of my own life and imagination and those of so many others...(there are websites dedicated to this movie...how often do you find that?)...this movie deserves to be called ""great""...and deserves that rare of rarest 10/10. :)  Having said that about this beloved film, I can now rest in peace. :)",Say Anything

138,chevdo,"Terrible, terrible stuff....",1,1 March 2012,"Like a bad car accident, every time this movie turns up on TV I am compelled to watch it and revel in its awfulness. I originally saw this one in a theater in 1989, and what I remember most from that experience was laughing hysterically at the dad sitting in his bathtub with his clothes on, sobbing about his credit cards getting cut up. I actually thought that was supposed to be a comedic moment until I realized I was the only one in the theater laughing and my friend who I went to the movie with was looking at me like I was deranged. But I couldn't help it, it was too damn funny! Now lets cover some of the more obvious plot-holes and blunders... Wasn't it oh-so-satisfying to see these teens being so concerned about drunk-driving that they give all their car-keys to a 'keymaster' at the party, which they aren't allowed to get back until they've spent the entire night getting blotto, because as we all know at the crack of dawn everyone automatically sobers up. Yeah, wouldn't want anyone to drive home at 1am, after having a couple beers, better to confiscate their keys until 7am when they've had 15 more beers....Now here's the biggest problem.. why, oh why, would a cool trenchcoat-mafia-type like Lloyd Dobbler have any interest in the stuck up puritan girl, and why does everyone else seem to think she's out of his league when in fact it's entirely the other way around? Lloyd is supposed to be the 'loser' because he 'doesnt know what he wants to do after highschool'? Here's an idea, Lloyd, why don't you spend your post-highschool life hanging out with people who don't have cardboard-cutout personalities, and haven't spent their entire highschool lives trying to please their dad and their teachers and every other adult in the world... you know, like Jeremy Piven and the 'Gas and Sip' crew, and thanking your lucky stars you never have to fraternize with any more status-quo worshipping WASPs like 'Diane Court' ever again?! I still can't figure out what was with the Dad and his subplot of ripping off old people. Were we supposed to feel sorry for him, or be mad at him, or not give a crap one way or another? Because the latter is how it affected me. In the end Dobbler actually accompanies Diane to England where you can be sure they will spend all of their time sipping tea and admiring fancy doylies, rather than catching a raucous footy match... As the audience we're supposed to be satisfied with that and happy for poor Lloyd who's coming directly out of highschool and aspiring for a life in which every drop of personality has been terminally squeezed out of him. Lloyd, you'd be better off selling something processed than running off to some bizarre Mary Poppinsesque fantasy with your chronically frigid girlfriend. Seriously, what kind of guy in his right mind would relentlessly stalk such a boring girl? And why would everyone else in the highschool, sporting the latest in new-wave and nascent grunge fashion, bow down to the supposed superiority of the illustrious valedictorian Diane Court? The movie establishes that through their highschool careers they hung around in different cliques, but can't seem to explain why that would be, since now that Lloyd is acting as middleman, Diane isn't just accepted in the cool crowd, she's revered, and considered to be TOO GOOD for the cool crowd! Maybe if Lloyd and Diane had smoked a joint and got silly with the Gas N Sip crew it would've been enough of a shoehorn for this to work, but as it is, it's just a mess. The moral of this story seems to be that unless you're a glad-handing junior republican, you are a misfit and a loser who deserves to have low self-esteem, and your only hope for redemption entails a full-time commitment to wholly embracing your potential for sheer whiteness. I liked Fast Times, although it has its share of problems, and I especially liked Wild Life, but it seems like with Say Anything, Crowe wants to compete with John Hughes by offering something 'meaningful'. He fails miserably in that, probably because the material he's trying to copy isn't any less contrived than this knock-off. When I read that Kirk Cameron was originally considered for the role of Lloyd Dobbler, the whole thing finally made sense to me. This movie was supposed to be a bland Christian allegory, but the lead was tragically miscast in John Cusack.",Say Anything
139,filmtvandlife,Say Anything,7,9 July 2014,"Cameron Crowe's directorial debut caught me by surprise. Boasting an energetic performance by a very young and exuberant John Cusack, Say anything is an interesting foray into the world of young romance Circa 1980 something.The story follows Lloyd Dobler (John Cusack) as he falls hopelessly in love with Diane Court (Ione Sky). The pair meet during high school graduation and all manner of relationship dynamics come into play.Featuring a bold example of gender role reversal in 1980′s U.S. culture the film chronicles Lloyd's attempts to woo the woman he loves, his subsequent continual rejections as Diane tries to stay focused on her career and the upset of the class divide between them when troubles arise with Diane's father.I found the entire film to be extraordinarily interesting and engaging, the director turns traditional romantic stereotypes on their head and reveals the tender side of male teenage head space.Say anything represents an egalitarian attitude towards romantic idealism in film, something that I consider not only to be very entertaining but also unique in its delivery . The film premiered two years after Dirty Dancing, which was a throwback to an earlier era and mindset but was hugely popular and I consider Say Anything to be a sobering antidote to the usual female Cinderella stereotype. (Uhhmmm Sixteen candles .yawn).Say anything contains THAT BOOMBOX scene and John Cusack won the Most promising Actor Award from the Chicago Film Critics Association for his portrayal of Lloyd Dobler .I highly recommend this film, it's an absolute treat, especially for those of us who endured the DIRTY DANCING craze and subsequent or previous Cinderella style stereotypes in popular culture and film.Read my reviews and join in the fun banter at filmstvandlife.wordpress.com",Say Anything
140,scottsandage,Excellent,10,2 August 2005,"""Say Anything"" is a Cameron Crowe masterpiece. ""Say Anything"" tells the story of Lloyd Dobler, played by John Cusack, who, Mr. Crowe takes no time to show, wants to ask Diane Court, played by Ione Skye, out on a date, with Lloyd's intentions of a long term relationship. ""Say Anything"" takes the ride of two high school graduates who both fall in and out of love. Their emotions are write on key at every point in the film. From their first kiss to their fast talking broken sentenced arguments, these actors where perfect for the role. The way Ms. Skye and Mr. Cusack seem to feed off of each other from scene to scene and seem to grow and love one another is phenomenal. It seems to me that this kind of on screen ""love chemistry"" is harder and harder to come by in theaters these days. The film is brilliantly written and directed as are others by Mr. Crowe, such as ""Jerry Maguire"",""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"",etc. I look forward to Mr. Crowes new film ""Elizabethtown"" due out in theaters soon.",Say Anything

142,CCRider01,"""I think i'm happy""",9,24 January 2004,"Say Anything was John Cusack's last teen/high school oriented movie,and at first glance it seemed little more than the closer in a trilogy of entertaining but fluffy comedies, that started with ""The Sure Thing"" and progressed to ""Better off Dead"".The first third of Say Anything,while being slightly more serious in tone than the earlier films,gave little hint of the depth of emotion that this little jewel of a film would show to the viewer as the story progressed. A story told a thousand times before in countless movies,namely boy meets girl,boy loses girl,boy gets girl back,but never before or since has a movie portrayed teenage love so sweetly or shown the degree of intensity that comes when 2 young people fall in love for the first time,and how all encompassing first love can be. The scene with John Cusack's character holding the boom box over his head as Peter Gabriel's ""In Your Eyes"" plays is obviously an all time classic, but the one scene that sums up the whole movie to me is the one with Lloyd and Dianne in the back seat of the car with a blanket wrapped around them,and Dianne asks Lloyd why he is shaking.

144,rosegirl,Lloyd Dobler is an institution.,10,27 June 2002,"***Possible Spoilers***For over a decade I have watched this movie several times each year. I just can't get enough of it...it is by far my favorite. And it has developed quite a cult following in my circle of female friends. To us, this movie is not just a heartwarming, mature romance about young people. It serves as a model for how love is really supposed to be...and what we want, and deserve, in a relationship.Lloyd Dobler is an institution. As his best friend Corey would say, in a ""world full of guys,"" Lloyd is ""a man."" In my little world, the name Lloyd has become synonymous with ""the perfect guy"" . When a friend dates someone new, I ask, ""is he a Lloyd?"" And she knows exactly what I mean.Cameron Crowe's script is phenomenal and his use of music, as always, is jaw-droppingly perfect. Thanks to this movie, ""In Your Eyes"" is now not just a great song by Peter Gabriel, but an anthem that pleads with you to believe in love for Lloyd's sake.There are plenty of laughs and well-written scenes in the depiction of Lloyd and Diane's high school peers. Who will ever forget Corey's songs about Joe (""That'll never be me""), or the drunk guy found in the bathroom? (""Look at this gentleman here""), or even the infamous Gas 'n Sip pow-wow with Lloyd's friends (""THAT was a mistake""). The real magic of the movie, though, is in the falling-in-love scenes (and later, in Lloyd's heartbroken despair over their unexpected breakup).In small gestures, Lloyd, with no ulterior motive other than to love Diane, comes across as a gentleman. The instances are many: the scene where he points out some glass for her to walk around; when he offers her ""Bavarian Dutch-Style Pretzels?"" in his car; or, sadly, when he pulls over to give her his ""full attention"" when he knows she has something to say....only to have her break his heart with a teary goodbye that leaves him dumbfounded.""I gave her my heart and she gave me a....pen,"" he says, and no more words are needed. We know that he has known love, he has been given a gift that was taken away and it will never be the same for him.Lucky for Lloyd, Diane realizes how wonderful he is...how rare is the gift that they have found. And they are reunited in the end, because they can't, won't stay apart from each other.Lloyd Dobler may be a fictional character...but he is also the dream of real love.

145,takeyourpantiesoff,Cusak was 22 years old during the filming. Mild Spoiler.,3,20 April 2013,"They used a 22 year old to play that dopey, misfit character. I mean really, to watch that flick, seeing Cusaks face, how old he looked, it was like watching a nasty man raiding the girls locker room at the HS. Seriously, I've seen the flick, it's nothing special. It drags, has an odd story line and has an ending that makes you fear for the future of the characters.And that whole boom box thing? LAME.If you're looking for some nostalgia, do yourself a favor, pass this.In my opinion, this movie is so overrated. It really should be exiled to the VHS graveyard. That's where it really belongs. Watching Cusak do the whole emo thing with his goofy wardrobe is more comical than quality romantic drama.Watch Unforgiven or Miller's Crossing instead.",Say Anything

147,snowball_236,Best teen movie ever,10,19 January 2003,"This movie was excellent by any standards, not just the ones set by teen movies. This movie was much more smart, realistic, and deep than any movie in its genre. The best thing about this movie is that there is actually heartbreak in it and that Diane doesn't come out better than she did before. As good as this movie was, I did have a gripe with it. Everyone who saw it saw Lloyd as average. HE WASN'T AVERAGE, he just thought he was. Think about it. He is this great guy who is responsible. (Think about the party scene where he is the keymaster.) He wants to be a kickboxer and he cares about people more than most people do.(Remember when he drove around Seattle all night just to take that guy home?) He is also very loyal and dedicated. Think of all that bull-s-h-i-t that he had to put with from Diane and her dad. A normal guy would've quit on her, but not him but Cameron Crowe did such a good job writing the Lloyd character that we actually start to believe that Lloyd is average. In spite of this suckering by Crowe and Cusack who is f'n amazing in this movie, I still love it and hope that this movie is not forgotten. I'm doing my part by lending my DVD copy out to anyone willing to watch it.",Say Anything
148,snowball_236,"What can I say? Anything, maybe *(SPOILERS AHEAD)*",10,25 January 2003,"This movie has been labeled as a teen movie and even though I like teen movies like She's All That, I feel calling ""Say Anything..."" a teen movie is an insult. Yeah it was a movie aimed at teens but this movie was much deeper than a teen movie. In most teen movies the main couple has a fight, makes up, and kiss right before the credits start to roll. However in this movie the couple, Lloyd and Diane, actually break up and they both emotionally almost break down. You see ALL the aspects of their relationship: The initiation, the big first date, the sex, and all the other BS that they have to fight through before they really start to be a couple. That's the great thing about this movie, the depth. The thing I did notice about this movie is that it suckers its viewers. You THINK that you are seeing the average guy getting the girl of his dreams but in all actuality Lloyd isn't an average guy. He kickboxes, he is very loyal and dedicated to the people he cares about (Diane, his sister's kid, Corey), he is very selfless. He drove that guy around the city of Seattle all night just to drive him home safely. He visited Diane's father in jail even though he knew the dad hated him. Lloyd was a really good guy, a great guy, but he didn't believe it and Cameron Crowe wrote the Lloyd character so that we wouldn't get that right away and John Cusack executed the part so well. Cusack is awesome. Enough said about that. Another commenter said that they didn't enjoy the movie because of its lack of humor. Hello? This movie was supposed to be serious. It's a romantic comedy with more emphasis on the romance element. Case in point: The boombox serenade with ""In Your Eyes"" by Peter Gabriel, NOT PHIL COLLINS. That scene was the most brilliant thing I've seen in movies. I tip my glass to Cameron Crowe for coming up with that. A great thing about watching this movie on DVD is that you can still see the 80's quality video which shows that this movie is timeless seeing that all of the people I lent my copy to related to this movie or REALLY enjoyed. (This a great movie to watch with a girl BEFORE you get into a serious relationship) There is a lot more things I could say about this movie but I am tired of typing. Anyway, this movie is awesome.

149,groomeschase12,"""Say Anything..."" (1989)",10,12 June 2017,"There are several small things that go into creating chemistry between actors/characters on screen, and in Cameron Crowe's debut, it seemed he had already mastered them. ""Say Anything"" has a small story and a handful of perfectly cast roles that are held together by wonderful writing in a movie that could've earned its keep for another hour.In ""Say Anything"" we see a couple of different, but very important, things that aren't at all standard fare. John Cusack as Lloyd Dobler, the lead, is unspeakably good. There is a nuance he brings with the character, a tick, a flinch that brings it to life. He's playing an ordinary guy, maybe a little too ordinary in some aspects, with some caveats we get reminded of a couple times throughout the picture. He wasn't one of the popular guys in school, wasn't a straight-A student, wasn't an athlete - it's the lack of titles and the usual stigmas with them that helps define this unique performance and character.Cusack is aided by a seemingly on-the-surface quiet performance on the other end by Ione Skye's Diane Court. While Cusack's character is relatable in that something about him applies to most males and the story is really, for the most part, told through his lenses, we see a likeness in Skye's Diane, we've known someone like her before. Her character is more of the distant type, close family ties and kept her head down and focused on her grades while her peers, including Lloyd, were out socializing. When we're introduced to her in the early stages, she's almost only something to be admired, and perhaps she'd stay that way if Crowe didn't write her so many important scenes and give her so many crucial moments that craft her character.There are a handful of moments in great movies that act as crucial moments for character without someone telling the audience how they should feel or how they should think. See Luke Skywalker looking up into the sky in ""New Hope"" or the look on Kay's face at the ending of ""The Godfather."" These moments say all about the characters that we need to know with no exposition, and there's a select few in ""Say Anything."" While the boombox scene is memorable, the moment that stands apart above all, and quite closely resembles the record store scene in ""Before Sunrise"", involves Lloyd teaching Diane how to drive her new car. In this scene, the audience catches its breath for a moment before seeing a crescendo of emotion between the characters with no words except for driving instructions. The subtle smiles on the character's faces and the culmination of the goodwill of their time spent is nothing short of infectious, and crucial.""Say Anything"" offers a lot more than its peers. While it does follow, closely, to the ""boy meets girl"" pattern that's tried and true, it makes enough safe, smart, and heartfelt moves and creates a few moments of great cinema along the way that it has more than stood the test of time. John Cusack portrays an earnest character that is important to show on screen because of his vulnerability and his believability, and Ione Skye acts perfectly as not only the apple of his eye, but delivers her own important messages as well through her actions and her beliefs, she's strong in a way that makes her character delightfully lovable and real in the same steps.Cameron Crowe created a wonderful time capsule of human growth, in an important time of two different but lovable characters' lives. Assisted with a catchy and timeless soundtrack, Crowe created a crown jewel of the romance genre that has a whole lot to say, and it wouldn't without his knack for good conversations, important character choices, meaningful scenes, and a whole lot of chemistry between two wonderfully written characters.",Say Anything
150,mrm1138,The best relationship film I've seen so far,9,5 April 1999,"This is a film about relationships that helps me to believe there is such a thing as true love.  For one hour and forty minutes, the viewer is allowed to step into the lives of a handful of very interesting characters. Strangely enough, one of the most interesting characters turns out to be the father of the lead female character.  In most boy-meets-girl flicks, the girl's father is merely an obstacle between the young lovers, but in Say Anything... we are shown a real person who is completely developed.  In short, this is a great film that will live on despite whatever it has been dated by.  At its core are some universal truths that will never be dated.",Say Anything
151,RENT Gal,I am searching for my Lloyd Dobler,10,28 June 1999,"This is the most wonderfully sweet love story ever.  I usually hate love stories, for they are usually so sweet and simpering that I need to projectile vomit directly afterwards, but Cameron Crowe's masterpiece is a delightful exception.This is his third step in his series that chronicle the maturity of love and infatuation.  Fast Times at Ridgemont High: meaningless sex and puppy love; Say Anything: first true love; Singles: maturing and finding yourself and someone to love along the way; Jerry Macguire: holding on to a meaningful relationship while attempting to raise a child.While this film is supposed to be about an ordinary guy and an extraordinary girl in extraordinarily ordinary situations, it ends up being about an amazing guy...no, a man.Lloyd Dobler is what every man in a relationship should be.  He should be consumed by his adoration and the object of his affection.  He is romantic, devoted, ""basic"", and attentive.  He realizes the meaning of everything that happens between the two of them.  He realizes that he is only as good as Diane believes him to be.  ""In Your Eyes"" is a perfect song for him.Every male over the age of seventeen should be required to watch this film -- and take notes!However, Lloyd is who he is because of the way he is portrayed by the incomparable John Cusack.  In the hands of a lesser actor, Lloyd would have been a directionless, goalless, stalking loser.  Cusack, in his portrayal of Lloyd, couldn't make  this further from the truth.  Lloyd is everything that Crowe wrote him to be, and more.  Cusack did such a great job, that he has caused me to search for Lloyd Dobler with the eyes of Paul McCartney!Fantastic for everyone!!  15 out of 10!!",Say Anything
152,Pam-21,"You Say it Best, When You Say Nothing at All ...",8,3 June 2001,"The magic, the heart of Say Anything, is that it dares to be normal. You remember the 80 teen romantic comedy genre. It was a nice idea that became an epidemic, but once and awhile there was a gem like Some Kind of Wonderful. But here is the major difference, the lack of cliche, the lack of formula, the lack of cute dialogue, and saying things without any words. Instead it is said with a look, a touch, a smile, and a tear falling down a face. It allows these talented young actors to _act_!John Cusack plays Lloyd and it is the fact that Lloyd dares to be normal that explains why the film works. Lloyd is just a regular guy who dares to just call the beautiful class brain Diane (Ione Skye) after they graduate. It is the genuine ""niceness"" and persistence of Lloyd's phone call, that is responsible for her caving and saying yes. And it goes from there. What is a friendship, a respect for each other, grows into ""friends with potential"", and then goes even farther. Writer-director Cameron Crowe is famous for not pushing it and he perfected that style here. He doesn't try to make John and Ione look and feel ""hot"", he lets them continue to play young adults, who would by all rights still be awkward, nervous, testing the waters of life, love, and trust.In a brilliant parallel, we learn of Diane's relationship with her father Jim (John Mahoney) which she has always been sure of, even when she needed to chose between her parents after their divorce. The subtle and detailed scenes between Diane and Jim are important to the twists in the story when Diane grows to trust someone other than her father and finds deceit with something she had faith in. Jim, is not your typical teen movie father. He's real and normal as well. His car is not backed into a house, he is not thrown into a great body of water, and he is not a typical ogre. He is allowed to be a three dimensional character, a driving force and an obstacle in the teen romance. Jim runs a nursing home and wants the best for Diane. He holds their relationship very dear, as it is all a part of Diane being the best she can be. That desire will end up being a double edged sword as Diane's growing pre-occupation with Lloyd the summer before she is set to go to England, threatens his plans for her. And although Jim seems to respect how Lloyd treats his daughter and him, he is bothered by Lloyd's lack of drive, that the only thing that drives Lloyd is the then almost unheard of sport of kick-boxing and Diane.When the story comes to important moments that changes Jim, Diane, and Lloyd's world, this is when the story shines. This is when Lloyd's rambling and desperation to re-define his life due to his despair is a welcome change from the overbearing or over brooding of most teen flick ""heroes"". This is when Diane's confusion and discovery is so wonderfully done with little dialogue. This is when Jim, feeling his world is spiraling out of his control, grows quiet, and the power of un-showy direction from Crowe says all we need to see.The supporting characters as well are gems, who are true supporting characters. Joan Cusack appeared uncredited as Lloyd's single mother sister who, once a blast is now uptight, but is still a supportive guardian for Lloyd. Lloyd's girl friends D.C. and Corey are like salt and pepper for Lloyd. Corey (played by Lili Taylor) is terminally depressed. She previously had attempted suicide due to fellow classmate, Joe, playing with her heart like a yo-yo and is always being the voice of negativity for Lloyd, always telling him what will go wrong, what can't happen, what should happen, and how he is different from Joe. D.C. is practically dwarfed by Corey, never being allowed to talk and never being able to steer Lloyd in a much more sane direction which Lloyd usually discovers on his own anyhow. All of the supporting characters of friends, former classmates, and residents at Jim's nursing home, are important, none are cardboard cut-out cliches. They all have dimension, depth, feeling, and we can understand their motivation, what drives them with carefully crafted scenes and dialogue.When the ending comes, it is the subtle way they foreshadow the future instead of the standard frantic pacing most romantic comedies have when it comes to a conclusion. That in itself pretty much sums up the beauty of the film.It is pure genius, this film is pure genius.",Say Anything

I felt that ""the sure thing"" was a much better and more interesting movie. SA just lacked depth,and the dialogue was not up to the level of TST.I also felt that Zuniga was far better than Ione.Cusack was Cusack. SA gave us no indication of why or where Cusack's desire to date Ione came from-and why suddenly now that school was over?Ione also did not show any real depth of feeling.Want to see depth of feeling-watch Zuniga storm out of the party in L.A in a jealous rage shouting out a list of all the things that annoy her about Cusack!Or when she cringes in horror as the English Prof starts to read out loud to the class Cusack's essay called ""the sure thing"".Or when they fight and really go at it at the punch bowl and so on.

Never during the movie did I doubt they would get back together after being separated... what surprised me was how the movie was resolved. The father was too easily turned into a villain at the end. Maybe not a villain in the sense of a man in black, but it still made the final resolution a little too easy. To see the real conflict between Diane and her father as she's torn between him and Lloyd dissolve was disappointing. I was expecting a more Romeo and Juliet type ending but I should have realized that Cameron Crowe movies never turn out bad. Despite my qualms, here were a great many touching moments and scenes.

Cusack offers a brilliant performance, making the character of Lloyd Dobler gawky without being geeky. He makes it throughly believable that a ""brain"" like Diane Cort would go out with Dobler.

The idea that you can tell your parent anything, and they'll listen to it as long as you're being truthful is great.  And, of course, the scenes between John Cusack and Skye are great!  They just have great chemistry, and they both put in such wonderful performances.  And, this film contains one of the most romantic moments ever in a movie.

158,alizay,"Don't be a guy, be a man",10,18 February 2006,"I think by now I've seen Say Anything about 20 times and every time I watch it I find something new that makes me love it. The film by Cameron Crowe is an enduring, romantic piece that can make even the faintest of heart believe in all the possibilities that love has to offer. This all begins with the acting.John Cusack and Ione Skye give fantastic performances, and bring these characters of Lloyd Dobler, and Diane Court to life. Many women still believe in finding a guy like Lloyd Dobler, and that's because John Cusack and Cameron Crowe created a character filled with depth and sensitivity. A character that has his flaws, but still believes in finding something, something that will give him direction and a place in this world, and that something is Diane Court, played by Ione Skye. Although, her character makes questionable decisions at times and the fashion choices show all the big hats we dread to think of today, as ever wearing, the character still isn't one dimensional. She is conflicted not knowing how to break away from her overprotective father and create a life for her own. A father, that is played by John Mahoney, who creates a great portrayal of a man who wants to be everything to his daughter, because he fears that in any moment, she could stop being his, and he would be left alone. Although, the character does not always act honorably, well neither does anyone else in this world. The Boombox scene is infamous by now, being parodied constantly, and spoofed in random unfunny comedies. Although,considered a stalking type of behavior now, watching Lloyd Dobler hold a boom box up to Diane Court's room is easily one of the best romantic moments of all time. It could have easily been cheesy and stupid, but the facial expressions by John Cusack, made us feel for Lloyd and want him to hold that boom box playing Peter Gabriel's ""In your eyes"", one more second Say Anything is a movie for the ages. When Lloyd's friends tell him not to be a guy to be a man, in that moment it was clear that this movie would stay throughout time as a classic '80s movie. A movie that didn't need to resort to sex to make it a staple romantic film. Instead, it was well written, and beautifully acted and deserves to be remembered.",Say Anything

When she says yes and decides to go out with him (Lloyd Dobler)he is overwhelmed and does everything he can to win her heart.........and doesThe movie is romantic, funny, and has emotional elements dealing with family life.

160,lotterypick,Awesome Film,9,3 November 2005,"From start to finish, just an awesome film. I can't quite put my finger on it, but it just felt like you were watching real people, not actors. I think its the manner in which a series of those uncomfortable, sometimes even awkward moments were strung together to form a plot. The characters seemed to have this desire to relate to each other by creating a collective cohesive set of performances that individually might seem out of sync, but combined together are in complete harmony. The selection of music was also just fantastic. That moment when John Cusack is holding the ghetto blaster,standing outside of the house, while ""In your eyes"" is playing, sets the bar of excellence for romantic comedies to come. It really doesn't matter if this scene is plausible or not, its symbolic, everybody should strive to have a moment like that at least once during the course of their lifetime. Its about self-expression, its about clichéd expression like ""wearing your heart"" on your sleeve and ""putting yourself out there"". Its a moment that will make you remember this film. A reminder to all of us not to lead a life of quiet desperation. John Cusack is simply outstanding as Lloyd Dobler, John Mahoney (""The dad from 'Frasier'"") turned in an incredible performance. This film wasn't your typical eightes teen romance flick, but it definitely left me with a great vibe at the end. It left me with, as cheesy as this might sound, that nice guys don't actually finish last and they do get the girl at the end.",Say Anything
161,paulgatlanta,A Tad Awkward,7,16 April 2018,"Before I get to my review, I'd like to respond to the wet-blanket elitist, who wanted to diagram this film like a term paper. 'Say Anything' is a teen film from the '80s. It was made about young people in the 1980s, for young people in the 1980s and deals with the issues of young people in the 1980s. If this means the film is 'dated' then every movie that has ever been made is 'dated'. To some extent, all movies are time-capsules of the period in which they were created. It isn't 'Hamlet' or 'Othello' nor is trying to be and if you are going to view a movie aimed at young people, you shouldn't be surprised by what you get. Primarily, that it will depict the world as it appears and is understood to be, by adolescents and that the storyline will revolve around the things that are important to them. These may seem naive, trivial or idealistic by adult standards but this is not the adult world. That being said, 'Say Anything' does not connect with me, personally. It is a well written, well acted and well directed film in it's own right. My issue is with the version of the world and characters it depicts. You see, I was a teenager in the late '80s and in lived in that world. In fact, remember when the movie came out. I watched it in the theater and had the same problem with it then as I do now. That being, it doesn't get it right.The '80s I knew was a combination of 'The Breakfast Club', 'Sixteen Candles' and 'Some Kind of Wonderful'. Those were the people who inhabited the high school I attended and that was the culture I saw and lived in. Cameron Crowe's version, while interesting, misses the mark by this much.I have a theory for this however, and that is Crowe was not a teenager in the '80s. The movies he made about his own adolescence and undercover work at a local high school, 'Almost Famous' and 'Fast Times at Ridgemont High' capture their time and people wonderfully. And they should because he was there. But he wasn't there in the '80s and so he's having to guess.Does it matter? Probably not. 'Grease' isn't an accurate representation of the 1950s and 'That 70s Show' is not an accurate representation of the 1970s. This is a film that is beloved by legions of people and the fact that it doesn't connect with me doesn't diminish it's quality or validity. It just means that I saw things differently than the filmmaker. For those of you who were not there and plan to view 'Say Anything' for the first time though, I would suggest you watch 'Some Kind of Wonderful' afterwards as a comparison. You may find it interesting.",Say Anything

Ione Skye manages to make her bland character at least mildly entertaining, though one gets the feeling that it should be her who is working to gain the affections of Lloyd, who is so hopelessly sweet that his closest friends are all female.

The way in which their relationship is dealt with is really great .Everything is done in a realistic way there is nothing in the movie which may not happen in real life except maybe the radio scene.

170,anncashmere,I recommend,8,21 June 2004,"I really enjoyed this movie because of the quality casting as well as the believability of the characters in the movie. This movie makes you think, laugh, and feel for the main characters. I recommend this movie strongly even though it is a movie from 1989. It is cute to see the way people lived and acted back then especially if you were very young at that time. The storyline is easy to follow and is exciting except for brief moments showing the main female actress and her father. I think most females would enjoy this movie because it is romantic but realistic at the same time. However, I think only a few men would enjoy this movie...probably the men who are very artistic and can appreciate a good film free from superficial hype (such as in high-budget films).",Say Anything

172,Dan-59,A movie that remembers what movies are all about.,10,29 July 1998,"I watched this movie for the first time with my ex-girlfriend.  I don't consider myself critical of date movies per se, but this one changed my entire perception of the ""chick flick"" genre.  It's one of those films which, for me, don't seem that profound until a few days after you've seen them. Then you start thinking about certain scenes or feelings those scenes provoked in you.  The more I watch this film, the more I enjoy it.  The famous scene (anyone familiar at all with this movie knows the one I am referring to) inspired me to do the same thing for my ex-girlfriend when, in May of 1998, she left me because she hadn't grown up to want what we had.  This film holds a special place in my heart, as does its love theme (which broke through the night air at 12:30am when I stood outside re-enacting the sweetest, simplest, most heart-tearing demonstration of love I have ever seen in a motion picture).  I am not writing this review to comment on one scene, however, but rather on the brilliance of it as a whole and that of its director, Cameron Crowe.  He never forgets that life is made up of moments and as such includes scenes which, while they don't necessarily advance the plot, stay in your mind and your heart long after you've forgotten the film's title and story years afterwards.  Say Anything... is one of my favorite movies because it explores things that have always been close to my heart (the possibility that adults, though older, may not be able to understand certain places of love when they've never had anything so intimate to relate to, the insecurity and mixed emotions that go with being your own person, and the kind of selflessness, spontaneity, and tenderness that define what real love is all about).  This was one of the best films of 1989.",Say Anything

Conrad Dobler, the hero, is a person of extraordinary character and goodness , whose virtues cast into sharp relief the more conventional good qualities that the heroine possesses.  If you are a teacher (I am), you realize that we should be producing in our schools people like Conrad Dobler, that they are worth a thousand people who are less kind, loving, responsible.  It's also a very funny movie.",Say Anything

John Cusack plays a convincing role of a kinda dork-ish, yet simply charming graduate, who is head over heels for the unknown super smart girl of the school.

I have to bow down to Cameron Crowe.  Along with his other movies he is so in tune with relationships and how friends, family and lovers interact.  Every word of the script is so perfect.  I can relate with every little situation.  You can identify with the unsure, but confident in himself Lloyd.  He captures so many of those little moments that you never forget in important relationships.  Things that you can't think of, but happen spontaneously. The music in this movie were so important.

177,dcwarriors,Cameron Crowe's finest moment,10,9 May 2003,"This movie is critically acclaimed and possibly the greatest teen movie of all time.  Ione Skye's performance in this movie is like the proverbial ""Lightning in a bottle"".  Skye's portrayal of the character has a timeless glow and beauty about her that she has yet to equal in any other role since then.  Her character, Diane Court is one of the all time great romantic leading ladies in movie history and should be well remembered 50 years from now.  The chemistry between Ione Skye and John Cusack's Lloyd Dobler is unmistakable and is so genuine that in can't be ignored.  John Cusack almost always turns in a top notch performance and deserves at least one Oscar for the work he's done since his movie career began, but ""Say Anything"" is the movie that elevated him to true leading man status and one of his best performances.  John Mahoney as James Court, Diane's father, and Lili Taylor as Corey Flood, Lloyd's best friend also turn in great performances that help the movie really ""gel"" and round out a great cast that tells a great love story.  Cameron Crowe's wrote and directed film and it's apparent by the finished product that he was, as Lloyd Dobler puts it ""looking for a dare to be great situation"".  He definitely found it, and he was.  ***The VHS version of the film also has a lost short episode of ""The Simpsons"", just knowing a version like that exists, that's got to be a good thing, right?***",Say Anything

He is simple and complex at the same time.  It is this character, and John Cusack's portrayal that put this film at the top of my list.  I truly feel connected to the emotional struggle of the character and his perspective on life.  His values are probably closer to what most of us should have as values. There is so much to admire about this character and so much to learn from.  I love this that this movie can be viewed on many different levels.  From a love story to a commentary on materialistic society the film has much to say and says it well.  It does this while still having much to laugh about and a little to cry about to. A great performance is turned in by the supporting cast as well.  It is a shame that more people don't see this movie for how great it is.",Say Anything

It SHOULD be the kind of film that makes one of my disposition sick!! Typical plot: boy, girl, completely different, fall in love, strange family life keeping them apart, forced apart and end up together..... But something else is going on here.... Firstly, there is the clever little sub-plot going on involving the father character played by the talented John Mahoney. Then there are the amazing performances given by not only the main cast (Mahoney, Cusack and Skye) but by the vast supporting cast. Joan Cusack is bitterly sweet as our hero's sister, while Lili Taylor is hilarious as Lloyds best friend!

This film, miraculously, never becomes sentimental. How does Cameron Crowe do it? This movie feels so authentic that I think I may be in love with Diane Court for life. I was also inspired by the film to be a man rather than a guy: ""The world is full of guys. Be a man."" And that Peter Gabriel song, great stuff.

There are elements of the story that you notice when you are younger, and different elements that you notice when you are viewing it from the perspective of ten years and the experiences that come with time.  This is an excellent movie. Each character is finely drawn, well written and sensitively acted.  The kind of love this ""teen romance"" movie depicts - ""friendship with potential,"" a companion who both completes you and extends you - is a truer and more lasting emotion than the cardboard Valentine romance many ""adult"" movies of the nineties rely upon.

Guys will love the movie because it shows that the average Joe only has to be himself to get the girl. The movie's most famous scene involving the boom box is something I would love for a guy to do for me. The only problem was the mysterious ending.

I first remember seeing this film 11 or 12 years ago when I was 18... One of my fave scenes in it(and there are heaps of them in the film) is the scene where Lloyd is holding the getto blaster out the front of the Old people's home where Diane is staying and you hear the peter gabriel song ""In your eyes"" playing- powerful stuff!!

Watching these kinds of movies with my kids has given me some magical memories that I will cherish as they head off to college and the rest of their lives.

It shows what guys do just to get a girl to go out on a date with them. There's other Teen romance movies that just doesn't show it all. This movie definately shows what true love is really about and what it does when that person hurts you. After I've seen this movie all I could think about what true love was about.. Lloyd's character is a heart warming guy who likes to hang with friends and is nice to everyone. Diane see's how he is and falls for him, no one else other than her father has ever showed those kinds of emotions towards her. After you see that break up.. all you can ask is why and wonder if they will get back together in the end. Of course I felt that they would get back together but I also knew that Lloyd's character would go through some difficulties and you really get to see how it will affect him. Everyone's acting was great in this movie and I love how they protray the movie from the beginning till the end. The best part of it is how guys get nervous to meet the girl's parents and it's true.. guys do get nervous when they meet the girl of their dreams parents..

Don't get me wrong, those movies are good too. This is a true heart warming film that has teached me about love. You see how just a look on the characters face says it all. How he struggles to move on with his life without her standing beside him and making him happy. You see how Lloyd is nervous when he meets her cause thats what guys do when they meet that girl who they've been having a crush on. Then it totally shows what guys do when he meets the girls parents. How nervous he is through the whole movie. She's a sweet typical girl who wants to succeed in life and all he wants is to love her and continue the life he's always been living but with her there,will pull him through. To me this movie is very great and tells us what real love is about and what guy's do when they get heart broken.

I understand it was going for a more understated (aka less cheesy than the usual absurd 80s cinema) and realistic tone but to me it felt...flat. I couldn't vibe on the chemistry between Lloyd and Diane.I can't quite put my finger on it but it doesn't really resonate with me the way it seems to with other people.That being said, it has it's moment and there were some stand out moments from side characters ""your an inspiration Lloyd...you should go on the 700 Club"" and the Gas N' Sip guys.Watch just to say you did.",Say Anything

I missed it during its theatrical release (as so many others did) and had the hardest time finding a copy of it at our local video rental stores. Not because it wasn't popular but b/c, according to the clerks, people kept stealing or ""losing"" their copies...especially around Valentines Day. When I finally got my hands on a copy I was blown away. I had thought this was going to be just another in a long link of Pretty in Pinkish movies with predictable characters and a bad case of puppy love, but what I got was a surprisingly refreshing, unconventional story with a complicated and well-developed emotional depth flawlessly captured by the actors and Cameron Crowe.And talk about role reversals! I'm so used to seeing the man take the assertive and mature role while courting a woman of limited financial or intellectual means...but in this film it's the girl that's got her future together and the guy who's more than willing to concentrate his attention on making her happy. And Lloyd Dobler isn't just a shiftless man with no future. He's an eternal optimist who lives in the present and recognizes, admires, and compliments the qualities in Diane that go beyond her amazing intellect. She becomes his dare-to-be-great situation and his absolute love and devotion to her is anything but unmanly. The force of it is palatable and immensely erotic without being reduced to cheap teenage lust. The sight of Lloyd in the shadows defiantly blasting out the truth of their love through the boombox is a scene which would have seemed awkward and goofy in any other movie but this one. It's easy to understand why even the critics of the time gave Say Anything two enthusiastic thumbs up. This is one of the few films that really captures the feeling of love.",Say Anything

Kinda weird huh. Well, John Cusak has made several movies I like, ""Better Off Dead"" being my favorite. Say Anything is not quite as quirky and thus more straight forward as a teen angst love story so it probably appeals to a much wider audience. I suppose you have to be a fan of 80's pop / college rock to really like the film on a deeper level. It is a bit formulaic as well, but the acting makes up for that weakness in the writing. I guess. Really I think I don't like the writing much and find it annoying. In fact this whole movie is annoying and reminds me of everything I hated about college. Really total rubbish and not worth renting or buying. I think I'll take my copy back to Costco and get my money back. I think I need some lunch, my blood sugar feels a bit low...",Say Anything

195,stonedog,The best John Hughes teen movie John Hughes never made.,10,4 September 1998,"It is a rare movie that allows its teenage characters to be human beings, and not just a collection of frat-boy cliches and ditzy blonde stereotypes. In the last twenty years, there have only been a handful: 'Real Genius', 'Some Kind Of Wonderful', 'Running On Empty', 'Scream', and this movie, 'Say Anything'. It stars John Cusack, one of this generation's most interesting actors, as Lloyd Dobler, a kick boxing grad who decides to call up the cutest girl in school just because it feels like the right thing to do.  The girl, Diane Court (played by Ione Skye), is not only beautiful, but smart enough to be valedictorian.  They both happen to be outsiders for different reasons, and as they get together, their relationship blossoming, they find they have nothing in common except love.  Sometimes, that's all you need. As the movie continues, we meet Diane's father, who will do anything for his daughter (a fact that comes back to haunt him), and finds himself in competition with Lloyd for his daughter's attention.  The screenwriter /director, Cameron Crowe, handles this competition and his characters with a deft, realistic touch. The title of the movie, 'Say Anything', refers to the relationship that Diane has with her father, in that she can 'say anything' to him, but the title is ironic, because it is what he doesn't tell her that turns the plot in a surprising direction. Crowe would go on to make 'Singles' and 'Jerry Maguire', but it is here that we first see his insight into characterization.  The performance that keeps you watching the screen throughout the movie is Cusack's, because his mind keeps working; you get the sense that Lloyd has a lot more to say, but is far too interested in Diane to focus on anything else. 'Say Anything' makes a good date movie because both sides are represented fairly, and while the resolution is a romantic one, the viewer gets the impression that it's the logical choice, too.",Say Anything

Lloyd, Cusack's character, made me smile and admire his honesty, devotion, and compassion.  Crowe stayed away from the many cliches that doom teen flicks and instead kept his film unpredictable.  I can honestly say that I was feeling incredible about everything after watching this film, from my mood to my life to my relationship with my girlfriend.

The plot sideline involving Diane's father does drag on but is none the less important. Lily Taylors character and her obsession with a guy named Joe brings some humor but overall the best person/character in this is John Cusack as Lloyd. he brings an energy with him that only he has. this is one of his best films and it was also nice to see several 'big' actors in smaller roles (Ellen's Jeremy Piven, Cusack's own sister Joan, Philip Baker Hall). Long before JERRY MAGUIRE and SINGLES, Cameron Crowe dealt with the subject of love and youngsters. He created endearing characters that you cannot help but fall in love with.

Cusack and Skye are entertaining and lively in their character roles. Some stereotypes were expected, but the level that they were played to was impressive. Two thumbs up for romances that stand up to the challenge.On the general par, the intimacy level at which these two main characters rise to is many times an ideal set by the public as unattainable and uncommon. Yet, how many times does such a true romance occur around us without us realizing it. I think that this story line shows a bit more of reality than we think.On a technical stand point, the movie could have used a bit more fine tuning and background scene development.

This film is not like she's all that, varsity blues, jawbreaker, i know what you did last summer, summer catch or any other of those mind numbing teen films, that albeit a good form of escapism in some cases (varsity blues) were generally below average films that were made just to capitalize on the high marketablility of the actors featured in them (except for jawbreaker, the concept and the film itself are awful). This film is about a real relationship that anyone who was ever in a high school relationship knows, a high school relationship seems like the whole world to the people in it. That's what this film demonstrates through its outstaning lead performances and with such a well-written script it is easy to see how the actors can pull off such feats. The film also throws in the internal struggle felt by Diane's father as he tries to evade the IRS and eventually is caught for what he believes was just trying to help raise his daughter. If not for the chance to see what a real teen romance is, then I recommend this film soley for the scene where John Cusack stands outside Diane's window blasting Peter Gabriel. Maybe today's teen films could benefit from following examples such as these, who wouldn't love to see a hopeful teenager blasting Eminem into the bedroom window of his love interest. Now that would be moviemaking at its finest.",Say Anything
207,BigMikeofNJ,Teen Romantic Comedies Don't Get Much Better Than This,10,5 July 2007,"A Seattle high-school graduate with no apparent future, tired and for most part abandoned Lloyd Dobler (John Cusack) sets his sights on the lovely Diane Court (Ione Skye), the class valedictorian, whom he had a chance encounter with at the town mall. After numerous valiant attempts and apparent successes, the two fall in love; however, while Lloyd is head over heels, Diane seems hesitant to maintain their relationship considering her recent fellowship at an acclaimed university and her father's trouble with the Internal Revenue Service. The romance between Cusack's Lloyd and Skye's Diane, although seemingly coming from out of nowhere, is still palpable and, as far as teen romance is concerned, very believable, and writer-director Cameron Crowe's bizarre and motor-mouthed dialogue perfectly suits the character of Lloydl; however, most of the scenes are stolen by John Cusack in what likely is his best performance to date; he fumbles over his words to accentuate the attitude of his character, and there are other moments when Cusack suddenly becomes the ultimate hero, even more involving than Rocky Balboa or Luke Skywalker at times; through the climax of the film it seems impossible not to root for Cusack, particularly the iconic scene forever cemented in teen movie history in which Lloyd stands outside of Diane's house next to his car, holding a boom box over his head and blasting Peter Gabriel's ""In Your Eyes"" with a look of desperate heartache and lost pride on his face. An iconic date movie.",Say Anything
208,charlesandheather,"The movie still rocks, but the commentary is why to buy...",10,24 April 2002,"There's little I can add about this film that hasn't already been said. So I won't.  I will say that the commentary by Crowe, Cusack, and Skye on the DVD version is worth the price of purchasing or renting this title.  There is about a 20 minute preamble where Crowe and co. talk about the genesis of the film, and the casting process. It's a fascinating look into how films get made, and in this case, a look at just how miraculous this film was/is - it literally fell together with all the pieces in the right place at the right time (with much help from James L. Brooks).",Say Anything

My wife -- who normally falls asleep when we watch movies late-night -- stayed awake for the whole thing. Obviously, the film shows the influences of the late-1980's.  Yet, it has a wonderful co-mingling of comedy, romance and drama to create a wonderful love story.",Say Anything

John Cusack really mails this some what strange but lovable character, which is the key to this being a great movie.

211,BetterOffLloyd,My Favorite Movie of ALL Time,10,24 November 2003,"I have nothing but good words for Say Anything.  I first saw it two years ago, and I fell in love with it immediately.  It is the one movie I could watch everyday for the rest of my life and not tire of it.  Cameron Crowe is a genius, the dialogue is great.  As always a stellar performance from the amazing John Cusack.  Lloyd Dobler is the perfect man and I couldn't see anyone but Cusack filling the role.  Ione Skye is great and believable as ""a brain, trapped in the body of a game show hostess"".  Also not mentioned as much, John Mahoney gives a very good performance. I would recommend seeing Say Anything, it always puts me in a good mood and its a great movie.  In my book it's a 10/10!",Say Anything
212,xSerendipity69x,"Ahhhhhh, how wonderful...",10,16 July 2003,"Growing up in the world of sappy, formula-following romantic comedies (I'm 17), I have not given up on the genre, but I've come to expect the same basic deal from them all. Then, I watch this thing on VH1 about Awesome Movie Songs, and there's SAY ANYTHING... with the boom box song ""In Your Eyes"". I didn't even watch the movie and I fell in love with the scene. Spent four bucks, rented the DVD from Blockbuster, and I have a new all time favorite movie.

214,PMoney340,It just works,8,6 February 2004,"I wish I understood exactly why this movie works so well.  On the outside it's nothing more than a cookie cutter version of a love story.  It follows the same basic trajectory as every other romance story I've seen and the screenplay is nothing out of the ordinary.  But there is something about Lloyd Dobler's (John Cusack) unfailing optimism that you can't help but route for him.  Diane (Ione) may make you want to throw something at the screen at times for not grasping how truly special her relationship is with Lloyd, but it's the fact that you feel impassioned enough to actually throw something that shows you really do care about the fate of these characters. Plus, if someone didn't go crazy and doubt the relationship there wouldn't be much of a story, and it's about time it's not the guy who messes up. Beyond the care this film evokes from the audience for the characters, ""Say Anything"" also includes one of the all time greatest scenes of any love story (or any movie, for that matter) ever created.  If you've seen the movie you know which scene I'm talking about.  If you haven't, you'll realize it when you have to mold your melted heart back together (hint: Peter Gabriel lends a little help).  Once again, I don't understand why I love this movie because I usually don't get into shallow chick flicks. ""Say Anything,"" though it epitomizes the chick flick genre, stands head and shoulders and  boom boxes above most other love stories because Cameron Crowe masterfully weaves a love triangle between Lloyd, Diane, and the audience.",Say Anything

I don't have to say much more other than I fell in love with this film, Mr Cusack character and quite possibly him himself! I usually find 80's romance films either too cheesy or they make you cringe, but this is just perfect, spot on!This is the perfect film to watch if you ever feel love isn't real or that you'll be forever alone, as this will prove love is true and will always find you! (now i'm the cheesy one!) This is the ultimate chick flick and I guarantee after you've watch it, you'll have fallen in love with Mr Cusack just as much as I have!!",Say Anything

I thought that the character of Lloyd was completely sensir(sp) and John Cusack did a great JOb. His character (Lloyde Dobbler,what a name!) is a completely lovable character. I began to really care about the characters the second time around. Now IMO this is kinda of a love it or u don't really like it type of movie but if u like comedy, romance, the 80's and John Cusack i'd definitely check this movie out. Oh and who could forget the famous Scene when h'es outside her room with the boombox held high above his head and the Peter Gabriel song (In your Eyes) comes on and you see the determination in his face! Uhhh it give me chills everytime!",Say Anything

218,st_kitts_sweetheart,Excellent Movie,10,2 January 2005,"Its a shame when this movie came out in '89 it was only a modest box office release because its better than any romantic/drama movie you will ever see today. It deals with real issues like teen love and hard choices in a serious and in a manner with which we can relate to. John Cusack plays Lloyd Dobler. He's not your typical man because most of his friends are women and he does live with his sister. Also Lloyd doesn't have any career plans except kick-boxing. His dreams all lie in a honor student, Diane Court(played by Ione Skye). Diane is a Straight A student with a scholarship to a university in England. She's very beautiful but doesn't realize it because she's so strenuously involved with her studies and dedication to her father(John Mahoney). Her father, later in this movie, will come upon hard times as he will have to deal with the IRS and being incarcerated. Lloyd and Diane eventually begin seeing each other and do fall in love but when Diane's father tells her not to have any attachments or distractions going to England, Diane breaks up with Lloyd in his own car. Perhaps one of the most engaging sayings of this movie lies after wards when Lloyd(soaking wet) is standing in a phone booth talking to his sister. ""I gave her my heart...."" ""she gave me a pen..."" His character is so sincere we fall in love with him. We hope and pray during the second half of the movie that both of them will get back together. Every thought is carefully plotted out until the very end. Both John Cusack and Ione Skye are brilliant and if you haven't seen this movie yet go out and buy it. Yes, buy it because you won't be disappointed you did.",Say Anything
219,tamgoff,This movie is much better the second time around!,9,1 June 2005,"I saw this movie as a teen when it first came out and didn't really like it, but saw again recently and loved it. I think it would have more of a commercial success if it had not been marketed as a teen movie, but it's too late for that now. The depth of honesty in the characters is amazing. John Cusack is great (as usual) and is consistent in his characterization throughout the movie. I greatly admired the way the movie was put together--no trite endings here. I thought it was oddly appropriate that Diane was so spoiled by her dad (without being a complete brat), and then ends up with Lloyd who dedicates his life to just being with her. She ends up with all the attention once again. And back to Lloyd--while success in life is defined for us by the media, culture, and unfortunately, our families, Lloyd defies it all to be a true success. Everyone likes him (even if they don't get why he and Diane are together), and he's just so real.He's thought about life and made decisions, they just aren't what anyone else may have decided for him. It's an interesting contrast to Mr. Cort, who has the material success that Lloyd lacks, but is completely devoid of integrity. Lloyd is vulnerable and completely masculine all at once. I think it was very honest the way Diane felt so betrayed by her dad and didn't even know if she wanted to see him. I can understand why I wouldn't like this at 17--I missed most of the point of it all due to my own immaturity. So glad I saw it again!!",Say Anything
220,kgordon1533,john c. rocks,9,15 September 2005,"No matter what movie he's in, John Cusack is such a lovable guy. He's just so perfect at making you fall in love with him and making you feel that he is the sweetest guy out there. He's just so likable and cute, how can you not like him? I'm a big fan (my personal favorite being High Fideltiy), and will forever remain one. And I don't agree with you people saying that he's so unrealistic in Say Anything... I think, no matter how annoyed your neighbors/father would be, most of us girls would like a guy (excuse me, a man) to play a radio outside our window. Maybe not exactly THAT, but something sweet to show that he cares. Although it may be unrealistic to fantasize about such a perfect man, it doesn't matter, because that's what movies are about, right? They were made to have fun - not to remind you of reality. John Cusack movies are perfect!",Say Anything

But looking through my TV guide, I put this movie on and I was quickly hooked. No matter who you ask, it is hard not to fall for humorous and kick-boxing Lloyd Dobler (John Cusack). The best part I think, of all of these 80's movies is that the characters, whether they are cringe-worthy/cheesy or not, all fall for one another--no Twitter, Tinder, etc. Watch this movie, because I promise you will fall in love with it as much as I have.",Say Anything

It sends the message that you should never ""judge the book by it's cover"" that there is something special in everything and everyone, just sometimes you don't see it right away.. I love the song by Peter Gabriel and that she points it out to him in the car.. This is by far the best of all the 80's movies and I think it will remain that way for many years to come.

225,jlavine-62142,Only in the Movies!!!!!,3,17 September 2019,"Only in the movies can a valedictorian act so ordinary to WTF???....Maybe I should be ""scared"" too.....but in my case I would be scared because most of us won't do all that well in life and judging from my non-valedictorian status in MY high school.....I mean...it's fun to see the true and sometimes very alarming disconnect between coddled well-educated film writers and directors and producers...and the real world. But I mean please!! Why was she so lovable when not one single word out of her mouth in the whole film...was remotely particularly ""intelligent"", let alone attractively smart, let alone brilliant?In real life the smartest girl in high school might be pretty but the guys wouldn't want to date her and neither would she want ANY of them.A way better film would be some moron girl sucking up to John Cusack cause he seemed to act average but was actually very superior, and then he discovering the dark snarky side of himself in dumping her.Intelligence is ultimately the greatest power a young person can ever want. What IS it to want that in someone else when you don't have it yourself? But I say nobody in film treats that stuff well, suggestions are welcome though.Another thing that ruined the movie for me is this madness/crazymaking of being guilty of something and still needing support so you have to become a liar. This can do terrible things to the one who wanted to help, ie: the daughter in this case. But why didn't this theme get treated more intelligently or even realistically? After all this is a ""youth"" movie and the ""youth"" today seem to be struggling with maddening situations all the time...and not doing very well with much of it...Why didn't the Cusack character just KNOW that that was what was pulling the girl away from them both and also pulling her closer to the criminal father character?The father at the same time seemed to be pushing her away while acting so victimized and clingy. So why didn't she just talk to the Cusack character about it? In real life of course that's what would have happened.So it was just a dumb movie with a completely unrealistic premise. The father was first confronted by the IRS while the Cusack character was right there, it's just a very dumb movie, but adorable John C made it almost worth it.But PUHLEEEEZE all you film writers and directors...PAY ATTENTION to reality before putting some pretty fluff and eye candy up with such idiotic premises. We deserve more truth and need real solutions in life too. What better place to find them than in the movies? So come on!!!!

226,rayie,"This one's got heart and a few great lines, that's good enough for me.",8,4 March 2006,"For starters, it's not the prequel to Gross Pointe Blank...it starts off with Lloyd's graduation day (Martin Blank ditched Debi on prom night in that movie, so we can assume he never made it to graduation).This movie contains some great scenes and natural dialog in it. It's worth watching if only to watch a few of these scenes alone. Lloyd, our main character, is an atypical leading man. Even more so if you consider the movie's setting. He's not quite total geek, loser, yet he's not quite total campus stud, jock, rebel. He's kind off on a totally different tangent. That's what makes him interesting. And so Cameron Crowe gives those of us, who were also never on either extreme in the high school social food chain, someone to relate to.Can't say the same for Ione Skye's character, however. She's a beautiful valedictorian, but Crowe keeps it realistic.Don't expect a strong story line...watch this for the characters and intimacy between them, and the lack of predictability.",Say Anything
