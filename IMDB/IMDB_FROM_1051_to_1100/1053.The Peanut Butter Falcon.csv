0,SnoopyStyle,endearing,8,13 January 2020,"Zak (Zack Gottsagen) is 22 with Down syndrome. He has no family and the state has placed him in a retirement home under the care of Eleanor (Dakota Johnson). After two years locked up in the home, he tries to run away multiple times. With Carl (Bruce Dern)'s help, he finally manages to escape between the window bars. He's a stowaway on Tyler (Shia LaBeouf)'s boat. Tyler has no fishing licence and resorted to stealing crab pots from Duncan (John Hawkes). He's on the run and reluctantly takes on Zak who has a dream of attending a wrestling school run by minor wrestling celebrity Salt Water Redneck (Thomas Haden Church).This is a road trip and water trip that pays tribute to Mark Twain. Zack is adorable. There is some tear jerking and some comedic hilarity. The acting is first rate and the characters are endearing. It is a little convenient for everybody to keep catching up to Zak although they do show the map where there is only that line. I think as long as the movie doesn't ignore it. These little contrivances can be excused. It's good that Tyler mentions pheromones. The other minor issue is the abrupt ending. There seems to be a switch which does suggest a tacked on ending. I like the ending but I would prefer not to get the misdirection. Overall, this is quite a magical trip.",The Peanut Butter Falcon
1,Horst_In_Translation,"Overall somewhat expected, but still charming at times",6,14 January 2020,"""The Peanut Butter Falcon"" (very cool title, I like peanut butter and apparently you can even eat it with fish and when he screams his new alias, it is quite hilarious) is a new American English-language movie that runs for slightly under 100 minutes and is the first full feature film effort by Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz, who directed and wrote this one. And even if they have worked for quite a while in the industry already (their experience shows here), for a rookie effort the outcome is pretty impressive and it makes me curious about their next films. The title character is played by Zack Gottsagen that you probably have not heard of, but don't worry. Neither have I. It is almost his first performance in a film too. However, you should have heard of LaBeouf, Johnson, Dern, Haden Church, Hawkes and maybe Bernthal as well. Gottsagen and LaBeouf are the undisputed leads and they certainly make it work. It is pretty amazing to see how well LaBeouf is doing right now and his role selection is just marvellous. Who would have thought that he could turn into America's maybe finest indie film actor after launching his big career with Transformers. And he is that good. I think he will have a bright future ahead and the first Oscar nomination is just a matter of time, although I wouldn't be surprised if he doesn't even care. Dakota Johnson is the biggest supporting player in this movie and it's good to see her in films like these too while everybody is being so harsh about 50 Shades. Not only does she look pretty stunning, she is also a talented actress (it's in her genes obviously). Bruce Dern is only in here during the first 30 minutes, even less probably, but he does a fine job for sure as always. With him I immediately had to think of his film Nebraska from a few years ago where he is the one going on a journey to a questionable target destination just like the main character does in this film here and both films have many references about specific regions of the United States. So when he helps him get out, he somehow uses his own experience. Nah just kidding. Of course, I know these are two very different characters. And with the impact Dern made in the first half hour, it seems that the final half hour it is Haden Church's turn and so does he. Jon Bernthal is used in flashbacks as he plays the late brother of one of the protagonists. John Hawkes I wish could have had more screen time, but he is sadly reduced to being a violent brute here. Far more talented actor than what he could show us here.Looking at the poster and trailer I thought actually it would be Gottsagen, LaBeouf and Johnson from beginning to end on the journey, but the first half is just Gottsagen and LeBoeuf and the two become good friends and even have a personal handshake between them. You have to go through special moments in order to deserve one as we find out. Johnson joins the group later on while all she wants initially is get the title character into safety again. But sooner or later she realizes that safety really means prison to him and at the end she fully understood, especially when she receives the information that they want to take the man to a place for junkies next. Now does that even make sense? I was surprised already that he could end up at a retirement home. The pudding painting with the escape plan is fun though. I think they did a lot right here. The boy's disability is constantly there, but it never really feels as if the film is about it at all and actually it is only about that when he brings it up himself and then it is even somewhat funny because his buddy knew anyway. In general, the characters feel credible and authentic and so do the dialogues. It was nice to watch and I never had the impression I was actually watching actors, but real people instead. The ending also offers pretty nice closure. We see that the main antagonist is about to hit one central character on the head with an iron rod and then the screen blacks out. So the filmmakers here played a bit with with us thinking if he could actually be dead, especially when we see only the other two in the car at the end, but number 3 is resting in the backseat. It was smart. They did not depict LaBeouf as somebody who is really strong physically and unrealistically beats up the bad guys, but instead he takes a beating himself. However, he will not let them humiliate his dead brother, so he sets fire. There is a bit of crime or at least negligence involved by everybody here like the act of arson I just mentioned or also Johnson's character actually letting the man get away, but you forget about that quickly because the characters are really depicted in a pretty likable manner. You feel as if you're with them really quickly and part of the group.As for the wrestling references, I never thought that the video could be really old already until we find out the school has been closed for a long time, but it does make sense too. Also the admittedly slightly unrealistic way in which the title character lifts the other guy towards the end and throws him out of the ring was kinda epic and a real nice reference back to some scenes earlier when we have the (former) professional wrestler say something like yeah that special move was just a camera effect and it wasn't even possible. However, Zak (almost the actor's real first name) shows us it is actually possible and wow the character was definitely way stronger than I thought he would be. Now that was surprising, even if he has a lot of muscle. Really funny ""You are not invited to my birthday"" quote too before he goes full rogue on him by the way. And it shows that even if you are disabled, you can fulfill really special acts, be it with the strength of your body or the strength of your mind. In general, I thought this film handled the subject of disability in a really accurate manner and stayed far away from both negative ends of the scale where it is too apologetic or too ruthless towards people like the central character. It was really nice. I somehow felt in-between maybe there will be some romance struggles because Zak could like the female protagonist as well, more than just a friend, but they did not take that path and that was probably a good decision. So a lot done right here. This is a film where it was safe to say it won't be featured (prominently) at the Academy Awards, but that is perfectly fine. I believe this does not mean it is worse than many of the actual Oscar nominees this year, actually even better than some, only that it went more under the radar. The happier I am that it succeeded nicely with other awards bodies and props to them for giving this movie some love. So should you and you can help for the film to go less under the radar this way. I recommend seeing it and give it a positive recommendation. There is definitely some nice charm to these slightly over 1.5 hours. Go for it!",The Peanut Butter Falcon
2,nogodnomasters,You'rt not invited to my birthday party,8,13 February 2020,"This is a heartwarming tale that centers around Zack (Zack Gottsagen) who has Downs Syndrome and is a ward of the state. He lives in a retirement community and desires to leave and become a professional wrestler. Saltwater Redneck (Thomas Haden Church) is his hero and has a school. With the help of Bruce Dern, Zack escapes and winds up traveling with Tyler (Shia LaBeouf) who is wanted for stealing crabs and setting a fire to crab traps. Meanwhile Dakota Johnson, who is not into anything kinky, is tasked with finding him.This is a feel good film. While it is not a comedy, it is light for the most part.Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity",The Peanut Butter Falcon
3,classicsoncall,"""I want to be a hero.""",7,7 March 2020,"Early in the picture, an elderly citizen of the retirement home (Bruce Dern), says to the story's principal character - ""Friends are the family you choose"". The rest of the picture demonstrates how that all plays out, as Zak (Zack Gottsagen), a young man with Down Syndrome, becomes a runaway to pursue his dream of becoming a professional wrestler. It appears that the story takes place in the present day, but if so, the owner of Bubba's trading post/gas stop is sorely behind the times with regular unleaded priced at a dollar nineteen, and premium at a dollar seventy five. Probably not going to get rich quick that way,Occasional flashbacks show how renegade Tyler (Shia LaBeouf) lost his older brother, as he undergoes a transition that allows him to become Zak's on the road caretaker and mentor, similar to the relationship he had with his older sibling. Tyler's personal hygiene and outgoing personality don't necessarily mesh when it comes to charming Zak's counselor Eleanor (Dakota Johnson), who makes it her mission to track down the missing youth. I didn't really see the chemistry there, but the story allows that to play out reasonably well in a fairly formulaic fashion.Before it's all over, Zak gets to meet his wrestling hero, the Salt Water Redneck (Thomas Haden Church), who retired years earlier but maintains a local connection to the back yard wrestling circuit. Hearing about Zak's dream, 'Clint' has a change of heart and decides to point the young man in the direction of his life affirming mission. Entering the wrestling ring as the Peanut Butter Falcon, Zak turns the tables on the local villain Samson (Jake the Snake Roberts) with a self improvised Atomic Throw, thus fulfilling a personal goal to become the hero he always wanted to be. Former wrestler Mick Foley also makes an appearance in the film as the wrestling referee and owner of 'Jacob's Inferno', the local wrestling hot spot. While all this was going on, I had to wonder why the role of the Salt Water Redneck wasn't cast with another pro wrestler, but Church was so good in the role it didn't really matter.",The Peanut Butter Falcon
4,BandSAboutMovies,Great!,7,14 May 2020,"This is the first film written and directed by Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz. It's really special. Yep - I'm going to dispense with that notion that a review has to wait to tell you how it feels about a movie until the end.It's all about Zak, a 22-year-old with Down syndrome played by an actor who also has it, Zack Gottsagen. He's living in an assisted living facility in North Carolina where he keeps escaping, hoping to find the school of his pro wrestling hero, the Salt Water Redneck (Thomas Haden Church).I love how this movie happened: The directors met Zack at a camp for disabled and non-disabled people and he expressed his desire to be a movie star. They wrote the script around him and his hopes and dreams.One night, thanks to his roommate Carl (Bruce Dern), Zak escapes and sneaks on to the fishing boat of Tyler (Shia LeBeouf), who has just been denied the ability to sell crab without a license, who he burns everyone else's boats. This sends Duncan and Ratboy, who is played by music artist Yelawolf, on his trail.Zak and Tyler become friends after a long and arduous journey as they elude the twosome, get baptized and also stay a step ahead of Zak's social worker, Eleanor (Dakota Johnson). Wrestling fans will enjoy seeing Jake Roberts and Mick Foley in major roles.This movie really made me emotional. Hopefully, you'll feel the same way. As someone who has lived a life in pro wrestling, I really understood Zak's need to perform. The idea that what exists on an old VHS tape not meaning as much today is something that we, as film fans, feel every day. I love that there was still magic, as Zak still gets a chance to have a match.",The Peanut Butter Falcon
5,CinemaSerf,Outstanding,8,23 October 2019,"I was a bit sceptical when I saw the casting for this - Shia LaBeouf trying to rehabilitate himself after his recent off-screen shenanigans with a heart-rending story about a lad with Down Syndrome? Well, how wrong was I? It is a an uplifting experience from start to finish. A brief appearance from Bruce Dern, a coating of of vaseline and away we go into a journey that sees Zak meet and travel with Tyler as they develop a bond that is truly joyful and convincing. You can tell that they both had fun making the film, the chemistry is palpable. Our family used to work closely with folks and their families coping with DS and the notion of restraining them for their own (and others' good) in institutions was never far away; this escape and subsequent adventure demonstrates, albeit fictionally, that the human spirit is alive and well in everyone. Highly recommend this film.",The Peanut Butter Falcon
6,oscaralbert,There's a horizontal scar running across the face of America . . .,10,4 September 2019,". . . commonly referred to as the ""Mason-Dixie Line"" (because the creatures living South of this slash mostly slurp from Mason Jars and Dixie Cups). THE PEANUT BUTTER FALCON deftly documents the low-lights of this deplorable backwater bailiwick, in which at least half of the occupants are differently-abled due to their parents' Medieval refusal to vaccinate and a thousand endemic Third World maladies such as the Zika Virus. As THE PEANUT BUTTER FALCON illustrates. most disputes in these better-dead-than-red states are settled with tire irons, which are wielded mercilessly against anyone with a mere smattering of smarts. Despite such brainless bopping, THE PEANUT BUTTER FALCON paints a picture of a region ripe for revolt, as Progressive proposals percolate among the South's Best and Brightest (epitomized here by the character ""Zac""). As some Old Fogeys are Hell-Bent upon retaining a 50-star flag for our U.S. Homeland, flicks such as THE PEANUT BUTTER FALCON and HOBBS-SHAW show how America cannot go wrong by substituting Samoa and Puerto Rico for a pair of uncouth Carolinas.",The Peanut Butter Falcon
7,evanston_dad,White Male Savior Fantasy,3,16 December 2019,"""The Peanut Butter Falcon"" is the worst kind of white male savior fantasy. It exists in a world where a screenwriter has things happen just because he wants them to, whether or not they're remotely believable or plausible. If the film had fully embraced a tone of fantastical whimsy, it might have all worked. But it instead opts for straight up realism, which makes the various plot developments feel lazy and stupid. And the whole thing just feels so underdeveloped, like the screenwriter came up with ideas but then didn't have the interest or the energy to fully flesh them out.Shia LeBeouf adds another obnoxious notch to his acting belt by playing a redneck loser who we're supposed to admire by the film's end because he teaches a young man with Down's Syndrome how to be a MAN. This means shunning authority, laughing at rules, and giving the middle finger to the system. That system, by the way, is represented by Dakota Johnson as the young man's caretaker. She inexplicably falls in love with LeBeouf despite the fact that he gives her absolutely no reason to, and joins him and her charge on a river raft journey in a nod to ""Huckleberry Finn"" so obvious it made my head spin. At the end of the movie, they all run off together to presumably be one big happy family, the screenplay conveniently ignoring how impossible and irresponsible this would actually be given the circumstances as they play out in the movie.""The Peanut Butter Falcon"" is full of sentiments that I suspect are the same kind that fuel Trump America. Its popularity, if movie review sites are any indication, mystify me.Grade: D",The Peanut Butter Falcon
8,morrison-dylan-fan,The falcon's peanut.,8,7 August 2021,"After a marathon viewing day watching the last magnificence shorts and feature films at the online Soho Horror Film Festival dedicated to titles by LGBT film makers,I was in the mood to end the night with a Comedy. Powering up Netflix UK,I stumbled on a Comedy that I've heard a lot of praise for,which led to me going on the road with the falcon.View on the film:Getting the role at the last minute after Ben Foster dropped out to spend time with his pregnant wife Laura Prepon, Shia LaBeouf gives an excellent,multi-layered performance as Tyler, whose drifting state in life is coiled by LaBeouf by a rather blunt line delivery of the great, thoughtful dialogue, which highlights the cold shoulder Tyler gives all who cross paths with him, which LaBeouf chips away at, as Zac builds a trust with him,that gives Tyler the confidence to lower his guard.Inspiring the making of the movie after meeting the film makers at a camp for disabled and non-disabled people,where he said that he wanted to be a movie star, Zack Gottsagen gives a magnetic turn in his feature film debut turn as Zac,with Gottsagen diving into physical Comedy exchanges with LeBeouf's Tyler with a real relish.Ignoring Eleanor (played by a sweet Dakota Johnson) demanding he return with her to the care home, Gottsagen has Zac perform a superplex on all those who say he can never achieve his dream, via Gottsagen splashing a smile of pure joy across Zac's face,as he wins a round at the end of the road.Leaving behind Zac's care home surroundings, co-writers/co-directors Michael Schwartz & Tyler Nilson make their feature film debut with a delightfully subtle, understated Road Movie atmosphere, travelling on the rural side roads with Zac and Tyler in long dolly and tracking shots glowing under natural light and a rustic score, which shimmer as the Peanut Butter Falcon scores his first victory.",The Peanut Butter Falcon
9,deloudelouvain,Heartwarming little gem.,9,20 November 2019,"After briefly reading a synopsis I didn't really know what to expect from The Peanut Butter Falcon. I was wondering if this would be a movie that I could enjoy but I'm glad I gave it a shot as it's certainly one of the better movies I watched this year, and I watch a lot of movies. It's a simple but effective story, showing us that people with down syndrome can have dreams and a fullfilling life. The chemistry and complicity between Zack Gottsagen and Shia LaBeouf looks sincere and is what makes this movie an enjoyable and emotion rich movie. I laughed a lot whilst you would think there is not much to laugh about with a serious subject like down syndrome. Zack Gottsagen did an excellent job playing his character, he made my day. Good cinematography, an excellent cast, an easy but amusing story to follow. I will definitely recommend this movie to others and I'm sure I will watch it again in the future.",The Peanut Butter Falcon
10,blanbrn,"Clap and cheer for this emotional heartfelt, sentimental escape drama of a dream coming true!",7,24 August 2019,"""The Peanut Butter Falcon"" is one of those movies that as you watch you feel touched and in some manner uplifted as you cheer for the little guy as it's nice to see a person on the run living one of their dreams!

11,DKosty123,Down Syndrome Emotional Roller Coaster,7,3 January 2021,"There is so much emotion in this story that I understand a number of ten ratings here. The Down Syndrome story here is very powerful stuff. The relationships between the characters are the key that makes this movie entertaining and powerful. The script has some powerful very quotable lines.The story of Zak, 23 year old with Downs Syndrome having been judged as unable to take care of himself so he is in a nursing care facility. There is Eleanor (Dakota Johnson) in the facility whose taking care and sort of responsible for him. Zak(Zack Gottsagen) wants to escape, and tries to do that. His emotions to want to be free and live are so powerful. He has his dream in a video tape of his Wrestling hero Salt Water Redneck (Thomas Hayden Church). He manages to escape with the help of Carl (Bruce Dern). Once he does, he just happens into finding the right guy to help him celebrate his birthday of freedom. When Zak first escapes he is truly alone.The emotions of the story of the relationships Zak forms are the best of this type on film since One Flew Over Cuckoos Nest. Zak does not let anything or anyone in his life stop him in his trip to see his hero Redneck. In fact, everyone helps him and in the process get involved with each other.The reason I can't go to ten on this is the story in the latter parts of the film gets a little choppy and sequences do not make sense. Eleanor, the institutional van which disappears and appears when the story sequences get choppy. Then Eleanor is said to be a Volunteer, which considering her dedication to Zak could be taken as a compliment, but then her going to the boss and being responsible for finding Zak and taking the vehicle to find him makes no sense. Then she gets aboard the Mark Twain story style raft and leaves the bus behind?There is a point where the guys after Zak's friend show up out of a miracle and burn the raft. How they figured out where Zak and his party are is a total mystery. In fact, other than when the dock fire is started early on, these guys only appear out of nowhere and with no logical reason why they are there.At first when they find Redneck, there's some choppy stuff in the sequence which does get straightened out. The Peanut Butter Falcon sequence is the part that puts this back together so the movie can conclude. If all this latter half of the film would have been constructed to make sense it would be a great film. Instead it is just a heart tugging roller coaster I really like. It has a message about humanity we sorely need at this time.",The Peanut Butter Falcon
12,Pjtaylor-96-138044,It's his birthday party and we're all invited.,8,29 August 2020,"'The Peanut Butter Falcon (2019)' is a feel-good road movie about a young man with Down syndrome who escapes from his care-home to pursue a career as a wrestler, meeting and bonding with a guilt-ridden man on the run in the process. It's a kind-hearted, uplifting experience with a positive, anti-discrimination message and a palpable, life-affirming central relationship. The piece is sweet but never saccharine, a perfect mix of mundane realism and smile-inducing absurdity. Its world feels tangible throughout, as do all its characters, and its narrative somehow manages to milk its familiar premise for all it's worth. Even though it is, essentially, exactly what you expect it to be, you can't help but go along for the ride. At the same time, it subtly subverts some of the genre's most obvious tropes. It's a great time that doesn't talk down to its audience. It's genuinely charming and it's also rather funny. It's great. 8/10",The Peanut Butter Falcon
13,ThomasDrufke,Rule #1 = Party,9,1 September 2019,"I've been watching some pretty heavy movies and TV of late, so it was nice to enjoy a light hearted and sweet film like The Peanut Butter Falcon. The story behind how this movie got made is probably worthy of its own film, see Mike Schwartz & Tyler Nilson's interviews over the last few weeks to truly appreciate the miraculous journey the film went on before it got to the big screens. Luckily, the film itself is good on its own merits, as we follow Zak (played by Zack Gottsagen), a 22 year old man hoping to fulfill his childhood dream of meeting his hero, Salt Water Redneck, and becoming a professional wrestler after escaping from his caregiver, played by Dakota Johnson. From there, he meets and travels with Shia LaBeouf, who's on his own journey of re-self discovery. From there, we have a modern day retelling of Huckleberry Finn, with its own sort of wrestling twist. And by the time you get to the final 10 minutes, they've completely earned the ending they present. It absolutely is one of the sweetest films of the last 5 years.9.1/10",The Peanut Butter Falcon
14,Cineanalyst,"Living the American Dream, Like a Mark Twain Story",6,31 December 2019,"Shia LaBeouf's character, Tyler, sums up ""The Peanut Butter Falcon"" conspicuously, at one point, with the above quotation. As every reviewer with even a passing familiarity with that particular ""great American novel,"" Twain's ""Adventures of Huckleberry Finn,"" has mentioned, this movie is similar to that river-rafting journey of Americana with the local color of its Southern settings and vernacular of its people. Instead of floating down the Mississippi River through the antebellum South, however, ""The Peanut Butter Falcon"" takes place in the present along the Outer Banks of North Carolina. There's the bromance between two fugitives: one, Zak, a young man with Down syndrome escaping his forced residency at a nursing home and the other, Tyler, a dirt-poor fisherman on the run after stealing crabs and committing arson. The ultimate destination of their adventure is a professional wrestling camp run by ""Salt Water Redneck."" Along the way. Zak comes up with his own alter ego for the ring, the titular ""Peanut Butter Falcon.""Fortunately, most of this is lighthearted, if also familiar and lightweight, amusement, and LeBeouf and Zack Gottsagen are fun travel companions, along with Dakota Johnson's caretaker Eleanor, who joins them later on. The wrestling serves as a play-within-the-play, although it's not treated as a con as with the play in ""Huck Finn."" Rather, the two fishermen chasing after Tyler, for his theft and destruction of their property, serve as the ""Duke"" and ""King"" baddies here. Given the literary allusions, another character met along the voyage that has me wondering is the blind preacher, who I would like to consider the movie's version of Demodocus from Homer's ""Odyssey,"" but that may be a stretch. After all, the Twain references aren't so subtle, and the minister's baptism of Zak, whereas Tyler states his preference for a baptism by fire, is a bit on the nose for a narrative about their rebirth. To an extent, all of that works, though. Unlike others, I don't think that's the case for the references to the characters' past lost family members, including flashbacks of Tyler's dead brother, which comes across as hollow to me, especially with the syrupy message of ""friends are the family you choose."" Nonetheless, it's a feel-good picture partially lifted by its lofty literary leitmotif.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

20,eddie_baggins,A heartwarming cross country adventure,8,30 January 2020,"Born out of a promise debut feature filmmakers Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz made to their down syndrome friend and actor Zack Gottsagen, Peanut Butter Falcon is the type of well-meaning and loveable character study that rarely comes our way anymore, in what's surely one of the year's most purely enjoyable cinematic delights.To be blunt, if you don't enjoy your time with Falcon, the tale of Gottsagen's wrestling obsessed Zak journey with Shia LaBeouf's social outcast Tyler as the two become mismatched friends through odd circumstances, I'd be very concerned about the state of your heartbeat, as Nilson and Schwartz's film is so full of heart, soul and joy, that's its seemingly impossible not to wholeheartedly enjoy every little moment of this unique and smile-inducing tale.Re-imagining the American staple of old, that see's lost souls find themselves as they trek across the expanses of the land of opportunity, Falcon is something akin to a re-imagined Mark Twain as we join Zak and Tyler on their quest, that while relatively small-scale in scope in execution, never the less remains impactful and insightful in equal measure as an examination of the human condition and the power of friendship.To be fair, there are slight elements of Falcon's final product that aren't delivered perfectly, most notably a rather rushed/slightly underwhelming ending but it's hard to find films of this ilk these days that feel so lived in and born from a place of real beauty.Front and centre to this joyful fable is both the announcement of a real genuine talent in the lead turn of Gottsagen and the rebirth of Shia LaBeouf, who after a number of years of questionable roles and even more questionable personal life occurrences, delivers one of the performances of his career as the lost and inwardly tormented Tyler, who despite a series of unfortunate life decisions, becomes a character we root for throughout the men's trek.Getting to watch the comically minded Gottsagen and LaBeouf play off against one another is one of the cinematic treats of the year, LaBeouf has reported in the times since Falcon wrapped shooting that this film and in particular Gottsagen helped recalibrate his life and its evident to see here with the talented but troubled actor playing out a performance that can only come from personal attachment and adoration for a role, helping ensure that the life affirming journey of Zak and Tyler will remain in the hearts and minds of cinemagoers for the years yet to come.Final Say -A small film with a heart of gold, Peanut Butter Falcon is an absolute joy to behold and an experience that is sure to live out a long a healthy life amongst movie fans that continue to discover it over the years yet to come.4 birthday party invites out of 5",The Peanut Butter Falcon

23,paul-allaer,"One of the best films of the year so far, period",9,24 August 2019,"""The Peanut Butter Falcon"" (2019 release; 98 min.) brings the story of Zak and Tyler. As the movie opens, Zak, a 24 yr.old with Down Syndrome, is plotting to escape the facility where the state has put him (we later learn his family abandoned him). Meanwhile Tyler, caught stealing crab traps, is fired from his job and on the run. With the help of another resident, Zak finally manages to escape, in his underwear and without any money or outside help... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this movie is feature-length debut of co-writers and co-directors Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz. The bring us the story of two misfits who somehow end up together on the adventure of a life time. Just as it takes time for these two to warm up to each other, it takes us the viewers also time to warm up to these characters. But as the movie plays out, the bond between the viewer and these characters grows very strong, and we are ""all in"". It took me a good 40 min. before I realized that the Tyler character is played by Shia LaBeouf, and played brilliantly at that. Ever since leaving the ""Transformers"" franchise, the guy has blossomed like never before. Dakota Johnson also shies in the side role of Eleanor, a staff member of the facility that Zak escaped and now sent to look for him. But surely the movie's limelight is stolen by Zack Gottsagen, playing Zak. It defies the impression/expectations so many people have about those with Down Syndrome. The movie is set in North Carolina's Outer Banks, and it looks gorgeous (and is filmed with many warm colors). Last but not least, there is a boatload of wonderful music, both as to the original score and other song placements, bringing a mix of bluegrass, folk, spirituals and much more. I will absolutely be seeking out the soundtrack of this film.""The Peanut Butter Falcon"" premiered at this year's SXSW, to immediate acclaim. The movie expanded this weekend into Greater Cincinnati. The Saturday early evening screening where I saw this at was very nicely, I am happy to say. When the end credits started rolling, the audience burst into a spontaneous applause, a rarity these days. But there is a reason that this movie is certified 94% fresh on Rotten Tomatoes. If you are tired of the umpteenth Marvel franchise movie or Disney ""re-imagining"" or sequel or prequel nonsense, and instead are looking for a top-notch ORIGINAL indie movie that happens to be one of the best movies of the year, by all mean I encourage you to check this out, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

25,jtindahouse,A film that is impossible not to love,9,11 November 2019,"It's rare, but sometime you just know you're going to love a film before you've even started watching it. 'The Peanut Butter Falcon' was one of those films for me. Shia LaBeouf in a role perfectly suited for him, mixed with an equally hilarious and touching story. What more could you ever want?I love the message the movie is trying to get across. That these people are just like me and you is so true. I love that every character has an arc in this movie and every character learns a lot about themselves and each other. It is masterfully crafted in that sense.It's rare that a film can be this funny so effortlessly. It never feels like anyone is trying to steal the show or over-act or is trying too hard. Everyone just goes about their business, and still hilarity ensues. It's rare that I say I would have liked a film to be longer but this is one of those occasions. I feel there was more story to tell and the ending felt a little rushed. I had a great time with 'The Peanut Butter Falcon' nonetheless and I suspect this will be on a lot of people's 'Best of 2019' lists.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

He encounters a man who is also on the run for a different reason. It transforms into a Mark Twain adventure with the pair on the run from others. Dakota Johnson is excellent as a social worker seeking her young ward. The script is smart and the actors great. The accompanying soundtrack is also perfect.

27,stevendbeard,Lot of Heart & Humor,7,25 August 2019,"I saw ""The Peanut Butter Falcon"", starring Shia LaBeouf-Fury, Constantine; Dakota Johnson-Bad Times at the El Royale, the Fifty Shades movies; Thomas Haden Church-Daddy's Home, We Bought a Zoo and introducing Zack Gottsagen-his first movie.
Zack plays a 22 year old man that is living in a nursing home, mainly because of the way things sometimes work in the bureaucratic system. He has no family or relatives to care for him and he has Down syndrome. He loves wrestling. He watches old video tapes of his favorite wrestler over and over and decides to go to find him and learn wrestlin' from the master. Thomas plays the wrestler. Dakota is the care taker at the nursing home and she gets the blame when Zack escapes and heads out on his journey to find Thomas. Shia plays a guy that keeps getting into trouble and makes certain people mad at him. Shia has to leave town quickly and crosses paths with Zack and they become fast friends-they are both on the run for different reasons-and Shia promises Zack that he will take him to meet and learn wrestlin' from Thomas. As most people know, wrestlers have stage names and The Peanut Butter Falcon is Zack's. The movie has a lot of heart in the relationships and a lot of humor, too. There are several cameos, including some wrestlers that you might know. Do the names Jake 'The Snake' Roberts or Mick Foley ring any bells?
It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 33 minutes.
I don't know if I would buy it on DVD but it would be a good rental.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

As turnout, this film is about Tyler and Eleanor(the nursing house's worker) helping Zak fulfill his wrestler dream by send him to meet his idol ""Salt Water Redneck""!

31,yusufpiskin,A masterpiece with Shia LaBeouf,9,10 April 2020,"The Peanut Butter Falcon is such a delightful film to watch. I feel like there is something just inherently endearing about watching happy down syndrome people, but this movie doesn't exploit that in a pandering way. In fact, it does the opposite and I thought that is what made it such a good watch. This movie is a great reminder that how you treat people says just as much about what you think of them as what you say about them.The message of no pandering is what got to me. Sometimes people just want to help and they mean well, but being overly protective and controlling isn't help no matter how well you mean.I thought the scene about Zak's future was so great and really gave the movie some afterthought. Both Tyler and Elanor are worried about Zak's future but in different aspects. Elanor just wants Zak to live but Tyler wants Zak to live which is very different.The scene on the boat was also plainly terrific.One of the few things you have to keep in mind though is sometimes it isn't all that realistic. What they go through and how they survive seems to be a little too upbeat at times and of course, there is the atomic throw scene, which I think can be written off as Zak's perspective so it's all good.This movie really surprised me and I was having a good time watching it from start till finish. Furthermore, I think this movie teaches a very valuable lesson which also counts as something to me when rating a movie.Believing in something is important but this movie teaches/reminds you that it is just as important to not listen to people talking down to you. When nobody believes in you and you start to listen to them your life is over before it begins.
All in all this movie has a lot of great things going on for it.Great acting
Great characters
Great cinematography

Zak is a ward of the state living at an assisted living home for retirees but he yearns to become a wrestler so much so he annoys his roommate, played by Hollywood legend Bruce Dern, w/an old videotape detailing the wrestling school. All he has on his mind is escape & the home's staff know it, particularly his caretaker, played by Dakota Johnson. One night, w/Dern's help, Zak flees making it to LaBeouf who's also on the outs in society since he's lost his fishing license & a couple of local thugs, one played by Oscar nominee John Hawkes, are after him because he set fire to their fishing equipment. The pair are joined by Johnson as they make their final leg to the wrestling mecca only to find it had closed about a decade earlier but the kindly proprietor, played by Oscar nominee Thomas Hayden Church, decides to take Zak to a local backyard wrestling match to live out his dreams. Not especially deep but more a quirky travelogue through Florida everglades & such peppered w/sporadic moments of whimsy to tie the characters to each other. Also starring real life ex-wrestler Jake ""the Snake"" Roberts as a friend of Church's & Jon Bernthal as LaBeouf's lost brother we see in flashbacks. Fun fact Bruce Dern made his film debut in 1964 in Hitchcock's Marnie alongside Tippi Hendren, Johnson's real life grandmother.",The Peanut Butter Falcon
35,aidanratesmovies,"Funny and cleverly crafted, unique film",9,30 January 2020,"Daringly unique, fun, original, and ultimately sweet, The Peanut Butter Falcon makes much of its premise with some terrific performances and a brilliant sense of direction. The film, although explaining the plot it may not feel like it, feels rather simple. That isn't to say it isn't a smart film however, but simply fun in a way not many films dare to try. The film isn't simply an adventure, a inspiring story, or an odd comedy, but an experience. The film is beautiful in a truly realistic way, it isn't afraid to show its true colors, and does it so well, it's hard to believe such talent can be brought into film. The pacing can move up and down at times, but for the most part can prove to be rather entertaining. The acting is quite good with Zach Gottsagen and Shia LaBeouf providing the standout performances. In the end, The Peanut Butter Falcon isn't perfect but is able to handle its story with such ease that it nears to be so.

It's a perfect look at how we as a society treat people with mental disabilities, and how that needs to change, how even the most rugged battle hardened people like Tyler have the most common sense of the situation in front of him, he shows us that compassion can go a long way. And while he still has to pay for his sins, he's fully aware and ready for the confrontation. The talent here are all at the top of their games, especially newcomer Zack who is an absolute delight to watch, full of humor and emotion of which LaBeouf and Johnson meet on equal caliber.

39,rannynm,Award-winning Movie. Never Underestimate People With Disabilities,10,28 August 2019,"I really enjoyed this movie because it is hilarious and sweet at the same time. It is extremely entertaining to watch and keeps your attention the whole time. This is an award-winning kind of movie!The Peanut Butter Falcon is about a Down Syndrome, 20-year-old young man named Zack, who has no family and no one to take care of him, so the state is in charge and places him in a nursing home. Zack knows he does not belong there, so he tries to escape several times with no success, until one time he does succeed. When Zack escapes he has one goal in mind and it is to be a professional wrestler. On his way he meets Tyler, a guy with a troubling past who also is running away from his former workers for something that he did wrong at his job. One of Zach's friends and volunteers at the nursing home, Eleanor, is sent from the nursing home to find and bring Zack back.The cast for this extraordinary film is incredible. There is Shia LaBeouf (Tyler), Dakota Johnson (Eleonor), Bruce Dern (Carl), Thomas Haden (Chris) as The Salt Water Redneck, who is Zach's favorite wrestler in the movie, John Bernthal (Tyler's brother) who we know as Shane from The Walking Dead, rapper Yelawolf (Ratboy) and two famous wrestlers Mick Foley (Jacob the Ref) and Jake Roberts (Sam). Last, but not least, is Zachary Gottsagen who plays himself and has an amazing performance in this movie. A fun fact is that Zach's favorite wrestler, in real life, is Mick Foley who he works with in this film. The music is great and perfect for the storytelling of this film. The song ""Running For So Long (House A Home)"" by Parker Ainsworh was specially written for this movie.My favorite scene is when Taylor and Zach are sitting by the edge of their water raft. Zach tells Taylor that he will give him all his birthday wishes because Zach knows all the things Taylor is going through in order for Zach to have his ""American Dream"" of meeting meet his favorite wrestler.The moral of this movie is not to underestimate people with disabilities or mental challenges (in this case Down Syndrome), because they are more than capable to pursue any challenge, just like anybody else. They don't see themselves as disabled. They see themselves as normal people who have dreams and goals to accomplish.I give this film 5 out of 5 stars. I wish I could give it 10 or more, but 5 stars is the limit. I recommend it for ages 10 to 18. Even though there is a lot of cussing, the drama of this film overcomes the bad words. The Peanut Butter Falcon opens in theatres August 9, 2019. I can't wait to see how many awards this film gets. Bring a box of tissues because you WILL need them!Reviewed by Ethan P., KIDS FIRST!

42,arungeorge13,The current times call for feel-good films like this one! [+70%],7,8 May 2020,"There are certain films that one associates with warmth, feel-good vibes, and truckloads of heart. The Peanut Butter Falcon is one of those flicks. It could have easily gone over the top with its dramatics and inherent silliness. But it doesn't! The writer-director duo of Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz play their cards well and how! Shia Labeouf once again proves that he's tailor-made for the indies. At first, I didn't believe that he and Zack Gottsagen would make such a killer pair of buddies (or brothers, the lines blurred subtly). Add the pretty presence of Dakota Johnson and you have a trio you can't take your eyes off of.The writing shows promise right from the start. The unlikely bond forged between Tyler, a struggling fisherman on the run, and Zak, a twenty-something man with Down syndrome never for once feels inorganic. We understand why Zak wants to run away from the retirement home he's put up at (it's a grin-worthy stretch!). We get to know why Tyler goes back for Zak after leaving him initially. We are shown montages of the good times he shared with his deceased brother. We root for Tyler when he believes that saving the young man and taking him along is probably his only chance at redeeming himself (in life!).The screenplay is peppered with plenty of laughs and smiles. There are ample funny moments featuring the duo - this includes the scene where they come up with the wrestling name and gimmick for Zak. That their journey is set against a dazzling rural North Carolina backdrop and punctuated by soothing country music only adds to the film's indie aesthetics. A feel-good movie is mostly remembered for its feel-good moments - we get just about enough of those - such as the three of them chilling on a makeshift raft, dancing around a fire, and more along those lines. (Rule #1? Party!)While Zack seems to be having the time of his life, it's good to see Shia use his eyes to convey his inner anguish. The shot where Zack comforts a crying Tyler will remain etched in my head for a long time. You'll also find Bruce Dern, Yelawolf, Jake ""The Snake Roberts, Mick Foley, and Thomas Haden Church in interesting cameos. If you're willing to look past certain feel-good-film clichés, The Peanut Butter Falcon is a fun little film that you wouldn't mind watching a second or third time even.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

Sure enough, it was every bit as enjoyable as I expected.With a bizarre yet uplifting storyline, quirky humour and an interesting mix of oddball characters, 'The Peanut Butter Falcon' is great. But there is one problem, called Shia LaBeouf. He features quite prominently in the film as Tyler, but thankfully is not as insufferable as you might expect.This is definitely a film I would recommend, especially for those who like their movies on the more 'unusual' side like me.

48,blott2319-1,Great simple story in the vein of Mark Twain,9,19 July 2020,"The Peanut Butter Falcon is proof that it doesn't take a complex original story, with multiple plot twists and big CGI effects, to make a powerful film. This is a simple tale of two men who are on the run from their lives, to find a more promising future. The unlikely pair is made up of two unexpected allies. The first of these men is Zak, a young man with Down syndrome who has been struggling to escape the nursing home he's been placed in by the state. Zak is played with great heart and charm by a relative newcomer to the film industry, Zack Gottsagen. The other man on the run is Tyler, a guy who has been struggling to get his life back on track since the death of his brother. Shia LeBeouf manages to make Tyler a likable character despite the fact that he's shown to be a bit of a screw up, and even a crook. Also popping up in the story is a young woman who is supposed to care for Zak. Eleanor is played wonderfully by Dakota Johnson, who does her best to show that she's got much more to offer than what people have seen in the Fifty Shades movies.From start to finish, I enjoyed the decisions that were made in The Peanut Butter Falcon. It is a heartwarming tale of friendship and adventure that is in the vein of Mark Twain. Each time that I expected the film to make a frustrating choice, it would instead steer the story in a smarter direction. I appreciated that the Down syndrome thing was a plot point, but it was not the primary driving force behind everything. Zak is established as a character with dreams, passion, and a strong motivation. This allowed the bond between the two main protagonists to feel authentic and less condescending (which is always a risk in films with a character that has a cognitive disability like Down syndrome.) Often in the film, I felt that Zak was the wisest and most interesting character. But there is one choice that the writer/directors made at the end of the film, which could be controversial. I could see some people taking issue with it going in that direction, but it made me smile and felt like the necessary way to wrap things up. The Peanut Butter Falcon was an all-around charming film and one that I will be glad to watch again.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

Since the beginning, film has had a rough history with making real stories for people with disabilities. The Peanut Butter Falcon, in that sense, is a long-overdue, breath of fresh air and a watershed moment for inclusivity in film. It places it's protagonist, Zak (a boy with Down syndrome) on the exact same emotional playing field as the rest of the cast. The other characters treat him like a real human being.

51,rockman182,The Peanut Butter Falcon (2019),7,1 September 2019,"Man, this looked like a super wholesome film meant to put a smile on your face from the get go. One of the most interesting people in Hollywood (Shia LaBeouf - and yes I'm very serious about that statement) and then the ever lovely Dakota Johnson, I had to make it my mission to see it. I'm very glad I did. I will echo a lot of the sentiments other viewers have about this. Its a well made and sweet film about a journey of friendship that is fairly inspiring.The film is about a man with Down syndrome who escapes the retirement home he was residing in so he can follow his goal of going to a wrestling school and learning how to become a wrestler. Its not a well thought out plan as he crosses the path of a thief. The two bond and the latter decides to help the protagonist on his journey to getting to this wrestling school. The two are being tracked down by the personal caretaker at the retirement home and crooks that are owed money by the thief.Zack Gottsagen is tremendous in this film. I know a lot of the role comes to him naturally but you absolutely want to root for him on his journey throughout the film. His partnership with Shia LaBeouf is one that is infinitely entertaining, sweet, and hilarious. LaBeouf is also fantastic in this and it is undeniable that he is a talent (watch American Honey). The characters and their quest just gels and blends so nicely. The film also attempts to inspire. There are always going to be doubters but its on you to try and achieve your dreams.This is a purely heart warming time at the cinema. its a simple but well made film that helps you escape as you cheer on the journey of the main characters. I think there should be more buzz around this so more people can know to check it out. Also, the Peanut Butter Falcon is the best wrestler moniker. You can't beat that alter ego.7.5/10",The Peanut Butter Falcon
52,RforFilm,"Without a beat, The Peanut Butter Falcon is a sweet, Mark Twain-like movie that'll put a smile on anyones face",9,10 September 2019,"Even within our darkest moments, we all have goals we strive for. A lot of people want more money, a better job and even love. But we also have simple goals, some of them being from being able to see the movies you want to see or being able to go fishing every weekend. We all want something to make ourselves feel better. This is why I really support those that are willing to put their distractions out of the way to take further steps to their goals, even if their little steps. If you want an hour to work on whatever it is you passionate about, then make that message clear to your loved ones when you want that bit of time.For today's movie, not only does the main character have Down syndrome, but he also wants to be a wrestler. Some might see that as only a dream, but you have to consider what a lot of people with special needs, including those with Down syndrome are capable of. I hate the idea of dismissing ones dreams (unless their ridiculous, like me becoming heavyweight champion of the boxing world). So let's see one's dream come true in The Peanut Butter Falcon.A young man with Down syndrome Zak (played by Zack Gottsagen) is living in a retirement home where he's cared for by Eleanor (played by Dakota Johnson) who tries her best to keep him happy. Zak hates the retirement home as he's the youngest person there, with the state unfortunately having nowhere else to put him and his family having abandoned him. His one escape is a wrestling tape featuring his favorite wrestler, the ""Salt Water Redneck"" (played by Thomas Haden Church). One night, with help from his roommate Carl (played by Bruce Dern), he gets out and proceeds to get to the wrestling school as advertised by the ""Salt Water Redneck""Zak eventually hides in a motorboat to sleep, only for it to be used by another young man Tyler (played by Shia LaBeouf). When discovered, Tyler reveals he's trying to get away from other crab fishermen he just got revenge on and also that the wrestling school Zak wants to go to is in his direction. Zac and Tyler make their way from North Carolina to Florida as along with the fishermen chasing after, Eleanor eventually find them and ends up tagging along.If there's a movie that can put a smile on my face in it's sweetness value, then The Peanut Butter Falcon is that movie. Seeing these two guys team up together to take this journey along the Deep South Rivers and oceans makes it a modern day Mark Twain story (in fact, this might be a good companion movie with Mud). On top of a good story, the movie is shot beautifully and gives the south a needed warmth, despite the darker nature of some themes.The story is simple; it's a road movie to reach ones life goal. While we've had plenty of these, what makes it just as great are the characters and the actors that play them. I defiantly have to give a shout out to Zack Gottsaden who is very likable from his first scene. I'm curious to the kind of direction he was given, but this also makes me understand what a great actor he is. Shia LaBeouf has been getting a lot better at separating himself from his dweeby Transformers persona to something a lot more mature. The Peanut Butter Falcon takes what Shia has always been good at; his determined look, and created a character that you can sympathize with, even if you don't always agree with him.Once the movie draws to how close both main characters need each other in this circumstance, we the audience get drawn in to see their journey, no matter how it comes out. Along with reminding me of a Mark Twain story, it kind of reminded me of darker Disney movie...and I mean that in all the best ways. The movie dwells into emotional storytelling that guides smiles or tears, depending on what direction these guys head.I'll give this nine wrestling masks out of ten. The more time I had to think, the more the movie stayed with me. It made me realize that stuff like The Peanut Butter Falcon are the things we need; something that really is both inspiring and sweet. I really hope this gets awards consideration once the season comes. I highly recommend this.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

55,kjproulx,The Best Feel-Good Movie of 2019,10,6 November 2019,"This usually happens to me about once a year or so, but it's so close to the end of this year that I didn't think it was going to happen. I usually find one film that warms my heart to the point that I find myself putting it on my list of best films of the year, simply because I found nothing wrong with it on an emotional level. The Peanut Butter Falcon is easily the best feel-good movie out there of 2019 and also one of the best overall movies of 2019, in my opinion. This movie has flown under the radar for mainstream audiences, so please, seek this one out.Living with down syndrome in an old age home, young Zak escapes in hopes of find his wrestling hero that he sees on television on a daily basis. The film equally focusses on him, as well as Tyler, who has issues of his own and is currently on the run to save his life. Bumping into each other, the two of them form a bond that leads to a very heartwarming friendship. With a few more layers to unpack as the movie progresses, this film has all the heart you could ever ask for out of a film, without getting overly sappy.Written and directed by two newcomers to the feature film sphere, Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz have created one hell of a little indie here. It's very clear that this isn't their first rodeo in cinema/television, but as a first film, they deserve all the praise in the world. While this movie will most likely go under the radar when awards season rolls around, I truly do feel they have given some of the best work behind the camera all year. On top of their stellar work, the talent on-screen is just as notable.Although Shia LaBeouf hasn't exactly quit acting, it has become very apparent over the last few years that he just wants to pursue smaller projects. Personally, I love that he has done that because his talents are far more suited for projects like this. Quite honestly, I'm not sure if I've ever seen him give a stronger performance than that of his portrayal of Tyler in The Peanut Butter Falcon. That aside, the true standout here is Zack Gottsagen as Zak. Nilson and Schwartz were able to bring out such a charismatic and natural performance from him and I felt like I was nearly watching a documentary with the amount of chemistry that LaBeouf and Gottsagen shared.In the end, The Peanut Butter Falcon is a film that I have been looking forward to for a while and I'm very happy with the experience I had when watching it. This may seem repetitive, but I can't stress enough how heartwarming this film truly is. I watched this movie with a smile on my face the entire time and with such great performances and direction to boot, there really weren't any glaring faults. When this film hits home video in the coming weeks or becomes available to stream in your area, I can't recommend checking it out enough. The Peanut Butter Falcon is one of the best movies of 2019.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

It's one of the best ""buddy"" dramas to come out in a long time.I possibly fell in love with Dakota Johnson and her character of Eleanor while watching. A small performance by Bruce Dern had me laughing the entire time too - would've loved to have had more of him!It has a really infectious laid back feel to it - bit of a road trip and adventure vibe, mixed with the feel-good and uplifting. It also doesn't shy away from tackling deeper issues, like that of identity, friendship and redemption.During challenging times like this, we all need a film like The Peanut Butter Falcon.Love the song at the end!",The Peanut Butter Falcon
58,0w0,"Not a comedy, but a tale of adventure",7,11 November 2019,"This movie contains very little comedy (didn't laugh once), so I don't know why they labeled it as a comedy... anyway, it's essentially the story of a young dude with down-syndrome who wants to be a WWE wrestler, and so he embarks on a journey with a random miscreant to find his WWE hero to train him. It's an OK movie... it's not something that I'd ever re-watch, but I don't regret watching it this once.",The Peanut Butter Falcon
59,MrDHWong,"A sweet-natured, feel good adventure that helps to reinforce the belief that we are all more capable of certain things than we realise",8,19 March 2020,"The Peanut Butter Falcon is a comedy-drama film written and directed by Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz. Starring Shia LaBeouf, Dakota Johnson, and Zack Gottsagen, it is a sweet-natured, feel good adventure that helps to reinforce the belief that we are all more capable of certain things than we realise.In North Carolina, Zak (Zack Gottsagen), a young man with down syndrome, lives in a nursing home in the care of social worker Eleanor (Dakota Johnson). Zak has dreams of meeting of his favourite professional wrestler ""The Salt Water Redneck"" (Thomas Haden Church) and manages to sneak out of the facility one night to attend a wrestling school run by the Redneck himself. With Eleanor pursuing him not far behind, Zak stows away on a boat owned by Tyler (Shia LeBeouf), a rogue fisherman and petty thief on the run from an angry pair of crabbers. Eventually, Tyler soon discovers Zak hiding underneath some sheets and agrees to accompany him, giving him life advice and even the odd tip about wrestling on their journey.Even though the final outcome is predictable from the start, ""The Peanut Butter Falcon"" still revels in its affable traits enough to charm even the most hardened of viewers. There is plenty to admire in watching how Zak follows his goal of meeting his hero and along the way gaining a newfound sense of self-confidence in spite of his disability. Oftentimes, I found myself forgetting that Zak even had down syndrome as the film does a wonderful job of inviting its audience to see beyond the handicap and focus on the curious yet determined young man instead. It would have been easy to simply make us feel sorry for Zak at every opportunity for some cheap sympathy, but due to his strong characterisation, each touching moment felt rightly earned whenever necessary.Writer/directors Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz handle this film's subject matter with a careful amount of precision to avoid it going down the route of becoming expendable sentimentality. The two of them apparently wrote the film around actor Zack Gottsagen's desire to become an actor and their respect for his dreams certainly shows. In addition to this, their use of the North Carolina scenery shows the tricky but fascinating environment the main characters must traverse to reach their destination. One scene in particular features a bird's eye view of an open grass field with Tyler navigating through it easily while Zak follows behind at a great distance. This is likely to show how big the real world is to Zak, who is used to being trapped inside a small nursing home while to the more experienced Tyler, this is simply a minor obstacle.Newcomer Zack Gottsagen gives a touching, believable performance in the lead role, clearly letting his own personal traits flow through his character. It was enjoyable to see him interact with those who believe in him and want him to succeed, which in turn makes the audience hope he does at the same time. Both Shia LaBeouf and Dakota Johnson were great additions to the cast, with LaBeouf's motivational speeches occasionally drawing humorous comparisons to his infamous ""Just Do It!"" meme from 2015. In Johnson's case, she is shown to be a caring sister-figure to Zak who despite some of her disciplinary tactics, still wants him to achieve his dream.In the end, although the film isn't groundbreaking by any means, it still serves as an entertaining reminder that no matter what we think is holding us back, we should still believe in our dreams and continue to find ways to achieve them. There may still be several obstacles to overcome, but in the long run, it all comes down to how we choose to approach such impediments.I rate it 7.5/10",The Peanut Butter Falcon
60,bshaef,What A Great Movie,9,13 December 2020,"Took me all of 30 seconds to get hooked on the story. The actors were perfect.

I cared about the characters, I bought the relationships, and I walked away with a bit more faith in humanity. Everything works, from the soundtrack to the scenery, and the end result is a simple story that packs a big punch. I knew exactly where it was going, but I wanted to go along for the ride anyway.

63,garethcrook,Simple and Beautiful.,7,22 February 2020,"You could file this under quirky, but if you do be sure to add a dose of lovely and a bucket-load of ridiculous fun. Zak (Zack Gottsagen) is in an old folks home. Except he's a young man. He has Down syndrome though and with no family, the state with no other options has him there under the care of Dakota Johnson. With the help of his understanding (and sadly under used) room mate Bruce Dern, he hatches an escape plan, one that sees him half naked on a boat in the Florida glades with Shia LeBeouf, who plays Tyler, also without family, home or prospects. Zak is open, friendly, inquisitive and obsessed with wrestling. Tyler is angry. Until he realised they're both fugitives of a sort. It's a bit banjos and desolation, but the burgeoning friendship between the two unlikely leads is every bit as life affirming as anything I've watched recently. Gottsagen is fantastic, sweet, charming and magnetic on screen. He brings out the best in LeBeouf, who can be a divisive presence, but here he's warm and uncharacteristically likeable. Now granted it is a bit overly idyllic, unlikely, a safe tale of adventure, but hey what's wrong with that, it's nice sometimes to allow yourself to drift. It's also a little absurd, especially as Zak becomes the Peanut Butter Falcon, but even for its playful nature, it's really just simply beautiful.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

70,sweidman-28016,The Heartwarming Film We Need,8,7 September 2019,"The Peanut Butter Falcon Review:The Peanut Butter Falcon follows Zak, a Down's syndrome patient living in an assisted living home, as he runs away from his care home to make his dream of becoming a wrestler come true. Along the way he meets Tyler, a man on the run after committing a crime, and the two make an unbreakable bond as they spend days together learning about each other. I had heard only good things about this film since it aired at various film festivals. I tried not to have the plot revealed too much to me which I think benefits sometimes. I was very surprised to see how many people went to see this film at 10 in the morning. That was giving me high hopes. Also the almost perfect critic and audience score told me something as well. What a heart warming film. We haven't had a film like this in a while that has a great message and is made to make us happy. The plot, though it can be pretty unrealistic at times, makes for a fun adventure. Zack Gottsagen as Zak is definitely the standout here. What a great performance. He has so much to work with to embody his character. He provides most of the comedy and there's no way to hate him. Shia LeBeof has finally had a great performance and I personally think the best of his career. I understood where he was coming from and how he perceives himself. One of the questions asked in the film is who's the bad guy and who's the good guy. He knows the bad things he has done and doesn't know which is heartbreaking almost. Yet he continues on with life an eventually meets Zak. Their bond was so strong where I stopped seeing Shia and Zack and saw their characters. You can tell a film is good performance wise when you forget who is playing who. I'm was just so happy when they were together and the serious scenes too. Dakota Johnson plays a worker from the assisted living home who is trying to find Zak. She did very well and probably one of her best performances as well. I want too invested in her character but she provided some good topics to talk about. One of my favorite scenes was with her and Shia and he's explaining to her that she's treating him differently since Zak has Down's Syndrome and she should just treat him like any normal person and not like he's a child. This film is very good at provides good insight and a beautiful way. I realized this film was special when the woman sitting next to me started crying at a feel-good moment that was a little emotional. Great films should affect you in some sort of way, typically it happens through emotion. It does get emotional at times. It was needed and knew when to keep on a scene longer or when to switch. There was one exception with the climax of the film. A big event happened and about two minutes later it ended. I would've liked just a little more since it ended abruptly. That was my only major flaw. Technically this is a beautifully shot film with amazing shots from above of the scenery, especially along the beaches and water. The score was good and peaceful. The technical stuff set the tone right for me. I'd definitely recommend seeing The Peanut Butter Falcon. I really hope it's in consideration for awards this upcoming season. If you live around the central Wisconsin area it'll be playing at the Stevens Point theater and I believe still at the Cedar Creek cinema in Wausau (that's where I saw it).My Grade: A-",The Peanut Butter Falcon

I loved the message it had at its heart, the characters, their journeys, and the entire vibe and feel of the film. It's fantastic.Shia LaBeouf displayed just how much of a talent he is, bringing an interesting and complex character to life beautifully. Zack Gottsagen was a revelation with an incredible debut performance. Not easily achieved when working alongside such a fine cast. He didn't stand out as a newbie at all, bringing so much life to the film. His character of Zack was particularly well crafted, and was a joy to watch. Dakota Johnson was expectedly great, as were the cameos from Bruce Dern and Thomas Haden Church.All of these actors were allowed to shine due to the brilliant story of this film, which was so well executed. At it's heart was the relationship between LaBeouf's Tyler and Zack, and their adventure south to seek freedom, a new life, and wrestling. The bond that the two developed was incredible to watch and was so life affirming. What massively drove this film was how watertight the dialogue is. As a result the characters came across as believable, flawed yet endearing people, making them very watchable. The conversations between Tyler and Johnson's Eleanor concerning Zack were so powerful and important, as were so many of the conversations between Tyler and Zack.I wouldn't say there was particularly anything revolutionary about the cinematography, direction etc. Not to say this isn't a beautiful film. I loved the setting, the gentle score, the technical aspects were all there.

The pair demonstrate an on-screen enjoyment of each other's company that can't be faked and is a pleasure to share. Dakota Johnson does what she can with her underwritten role, and there are some nice cameos from old stagers Bruce Dern and Thomas Haden Church. The central message is one of trust in and empathy for our fellow human beings, and the danger of lapsing into violence when these qualities are absent. That's easy to say, but hard to dramatise without lapsing into sentimentality. Due to the integrity of the peformances and the good taste of writer-directors Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz there are no such lapses here. Genuinely enjoyable.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

Shia LeBouf puts in another legendary performance - add the notch, he's one of my favorite actors working this decade (I think Joaquin Phoenix might be the ONLY person I'd put above him right now). Dakota Johnson puts in the best performance I have ever seen her give - I felt it. We get wildly amusing small character roles from Bruce Dern, Thomas Hayden Church, Jake The Snake Roberts, Mick Foley, Yelawolf, and more.On top of the brilliantly heartfelt writing & acting, and effective directing - there is also a lot of stuff that is shot really beautifully!All killer, no filler.

Big credit to Zack, I can't imagine how difficult it must be wanting to be a movie star and never getting your chance just because you have Down Syndrome. The story is basic and nothing too interesting but it carries well and has a few nice and tense moments and a surprisingly amount of sad ones. I expected it to mainly just be a an at the end sad time bittersweet but it's actually pretty sad for chunks of it. Still definitely falls into the feel good category.Props to the music department on this one. Not just for including the only country singer I like (Colter Wall) but also just in general. The guitar heavy finger picking style really suits the films middle of no where adventure style. With that being said a large majority of the film is told in musical montages, which left me with just a tingle of emptiness at areas. However I do understand the struggles of making a movie where the characters are on foot walking for a majority of the movie. The start in the Everglades type marshland really reminded me of Swamp Thing, so that was a nice touch.All in all it's a pretty fun feel good movie. Definitely benefits from watching it in the hot summer and does make you want to go on an adventure. Also a quick props to how the small villain characters are written. When they're beating Shia I like how they didn't beat him all the way because realistically not everyone has the stomach for that. They just kick him a few times then leave.7/10, watch it if you want a pick me up with a fun story. This one is going on my guilty pleasures list.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

I first came across the movie while looking for more of Dakota Johnson's works, but I really looked forward to it after seeing Zack and Shia LaBoeuf present an award at the Oscars last February. Zack Gottsagen is a truly amazing talent and Shia LaBoeuf puts on a brilliant performance for his comeback.

Casting was perfect and the style suits LaBeouf very well. Funny, touching, and engaging, this small scale adventure shows the bright side of life, and the good side of people.Overall, the brilliance of this film is that, despite the main character having Downs syndrome, the whole film does not revolve around disability, and what people can't do. It's not 'inspiring' or anything like that because it's about someone overcoming obstacles, it's about recognising what people can do, and noticing when restricting someone because of your concerns is really benefitting yourself, and not them. It's really positive to see a character with a disability portrayed closer to reality, someone with strengths and weaknesses just like everyone else.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

The movie is filled with a Powerful message of hope, empathy, camaraderie and empowerment for people with not only Down Syndrome but to everyone who is let down. It's refreshing to see Down syndrome portrayed in a positive light in the movie. Though the plot of this mismatched-buddies drama may feel overly familiar, the bold casting and watery setting provide a welcome edginess that enhances the inevitable sweetness, making it genuine.Cinematography forms the pulse of the movie and sets a brilliant tone with its work. Editing is equally brilliant in keeping the total runtime to 97 minutes. Screenplay and character development were one of the best I have come across in months, if not years. Music adds a lot of fleur to the already emotional story. Production design, costumes and makeup are brilliant. Full credit to directors Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz for their excellent work. On the acting front, Shia leBeouf aces his character fantastically well aided by Zack Gottsagen as Zak and a gorgeous looking Dakota Johnson as Eleanor.Overall, Though there were a few slower parts in between, but that's where some of the most important parts of story come out. These slower sections also give the viewer the feeling that you're along on this slow, lazy ride down the coast with these characters.

However, every now and then a little gem appears and hits you between the eyes when you least expect it. Peanut Butter Falcon is that gem. It's a story of a young man, Zak, who has Downs Syndrome (played brilliantly by Zack Gottsagen) and who dreams of escaping his care home and being 'alive'. He meets Tyler (an excellent Shia LeBouf), who, in his own way, is equally lost. And so begins a beautiful friendship, and a joyous road trip seeking Zak's wrestling hero from bygone years. I cried, I laughed, I cried again. What a beautiful yet understated study of human friendship and kindness, with not a hint of saccharine. The film reminded me of why i love cinema so much. It is well worth seeking out....:",The Peanut Butter Falcon
84,austin0731,Pure and authentic,8,28 September 2019,"The Peanut Butter Falcon is a movie about a young man with down syndrome, Zak who runs away to try to achieve his dreams of becoming a wrestler. I really enjoyed this film for what it represented, it is the few times like this where cinema can provide not only an entertaining experience but an experience that goes well beyond that where the beauty of this artform lies. The Peanut Butter Falcon is a story about belief, family and the pureness of hearts.I think the movie wonderfully casted Shia Labeouf and Dakota Johnson, both actors have faced their fair share of controversy. Dakota Johnson, known mostly from her involvement in the infamous fifty Shades of Grey franchise gets to show her reserved side and gives a sophisticated performance that washes away all the negative reputation from her previous film roles. Shia Labeouf on the other hand has a much greater lesson learned from his involvement here. Starting off as a child actor and getting fame from being in the Transformers franchise, it has been a while since he has been in a major film role; becoming an internet meme certainly has not supported that downwards spiral in his career. It seemed like for a moment there Labeouf's career in Hollywood is at the end of the line, but this movie, seeing his character's transformation just by being with the incredible presence of Zak brings a newfound authenticity to his performance. There is something raw and transformative in his role here that almost goes beyond the fictional on screen character but almost seems to show his real life turn.The film centers around wrestling and as a wrestling fan I would like to share my perspective on the matter. Wrestling has had its days in the early 90s but since then it has been seen as overly choreographed, gimmicked or even childish. After the so-called 'kayfabe' has gone wrestling fans are constantly being challenged with 'don't you know that it is fake?'That age old question that we all love, I think The Peanut Butter Falcon handles this very well, in discussing the theme of authenticity, dreams and beliefs. Incorporating Zak's childlike nature and imagination into the notion that in wrestling, its truly about conveying belief. Wrestling is not about fooling the fans into believing in something that is not true, but to pull out the real and authentic emotions by a delicately choreographed performance between two performers. Which is why oftentimes the best matches and storylines are those that incorporate the real lives and events of the wrestler.The Peanut Butter Falcon smartly deals with this, and presents it in a way that is so pure and heartfelt, overall it was a very enjoyable and feel good type movie. So, unless you hate having that warm fuzzy feeling that gives you that uncontrollable grin, this movie is for you.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

We meet a guy named Zak, he has Down Syndrome, lives in a nursing, no family, has Bruce Dern as a roommate and he loves wrestling, so much so, that he plans to break free of his forced housing, go on the run to The Salt Water Redneck's Wrestling School, and with the help of some friends at the home... hint: Bruce Dern... he breaks free. While on the run, he hides on a boat that belongs to Tyler, a fisherman, hobo with a shotgun, and also on the run from a few locals, because Tyler may or may not have destroyed several thousand dollars worth of their equipment. ONce he discovers Zak crashing on his boat, hears his tale, Tyler decides to help him out with the journey. Zak of course has someone looking out for him as well, in this case the nursing home bypasses authorities and just sends a lone aide, Eleanor, out to find him.

88,Lewis_Heather787,Brilliantly uplifting !,8,8 September 2019,"Once in a while its nice to watch a film that is not only really uplifting but has so many outstanding aspects to it that work so well together, to create a really heartfelt and joyous film.A story of two completely different people, not only in terms of who they are but at what stages they are in their lives, happen to met each other and join forces to go on a hilarious adventure. Shia LaBeouf plays ""Tyler"" a complicated but at heart all round nice guy, trying to move on from his past and find something new in life. Trying to come to terms with his brothers death, that he has involved in, makes the trauma and memories all the more real when he meets ""Zak"". ""Zak"" who is played by Zack Gottsagen is a runaway from a care home wanting to experience life and to find a wrestling star to train him to become a professional wrestler. The reason for running away from the care home, in particular from Dakota Johnson's character ""Eleanor"", is because he feels trapped by the constraints put upon him because he is Downs Syndrome.Once ""Tyler"" and ""Zak"" meet paths they, after some funny teething problems, decide to go on this adventure and start becoming good friends. ""Tyler"" almost sees it as a second chance at having brother again, hits very hard with the use of flash backs in the film. Whilst ""Zak"" sees what its like to be treated like anyone else and to have someone he can call a friend.The adventure is hilarious to say the least, the back and forth between Shia LaBeouf and Zack Gottsagen is brilliant, makes you genuinely believe there growing friendship. In the end after considerable searching, ""Elenaor"" eventually stumbles upon both ""Tyler"" and ""Zak"" together, and after some convincing, decides to join them on there adventure to find the wrestling trainer.The overriding feeling after seeing this film is just confirmation that anything can be done within the medium of film. Such an uplifting film but with such heart and emotional backstory that really grips you as an audience member. All the characters portrayed in their unique way are relatable in what they are looking for in life, its the same as everyone else. Happiness !Overall its a very good film 80% out of 100 or 8 out of 10, yes the ending is a little contrived but I didn't expect anything different, almost thought for a minute that Shia LaBeouf had been killed but nope!

But overall, I think it was well done. The acting by Shia and Zack was very good, they had very good chemistry. There were some scenes that were a bit rough around the edges, the actors flubbing their lines or accidentally talking over each other. And some elements were a bit unrealistic, like how quickly Dakota Johnson's character finds them (which could have easily been explained if the blind man had directed her); and of course the final big scene was 'over the top'.

97,RhapsodyReviews,Amazing!,10,17 November 2019,"Review:
'The Peanut Butter Falcon' is a comedy-drama film directed by Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz.
This movie might be my favorite to come out of 2019. It grabs you straight from the get-go and evolves its characters so well, you are with them the whole way through.
Its plot follows a young man with Down's syndrome, Zak (Zack Gottsagen) who escapes from an assisted living facility and befriends a wayward fisherman on the run (Shia LaBeouf); as the two men form a rapid bond, a social worker (Dakota Johnson) attempts to track them.
The performances all around are great, but Zack Gottsagen as Zak is the standout here. He has so much to work with to embody his character. He provides most of the comedy in the movie, but you're not laughing at his character so much as his personality. Shia LaBeouf has had many great performances, but I personally think this is the best of his career. I understood where he was coming from and how he perceives himself. Dakota Johnson may have made some bad choices with movies in the past (50 Shades of Grey), but she was excellent in this movie. The three main leads had amazing chemistry and carried this movies story forward.
I enjoyed how the director weren't scared of using quite scenes. Movies nowadays seem like they need to have characters talking back and forth all the time, this movie had dead air at times, and it made the tension build up when it needed to. The story is what makes this movie at great as it is. It's a feel-good movie at its core for sure, but it has tension at time too.
Overall, the story is beautiful, the performances are spot on and the emotions it makes you feel are amazing. I really hope this movie gets the love it deserves, and I highly recommend people watch it.

I loved almost every minute of it. The film was sweet and funny. Most of that was do to Zach Gottsagen. He was fantastic in this film. It would have been great for him to get a nomination for an Oscar but there were many other great performances in 2019 too. Shia Labeouf also gave his all. Together they were both fantastic. Dakota Johnson did okay too. There was no problems with the acting in my mind. The story I thought, was pretty solid too. The beginning I thought was just a little sloppy but besides that, the story was flawless. It was surprisingly a really funny movie. I found my self laughing pretty hard at most of the scenes.

A boy with Down Syndrome leaves his nursing home with a dream of becoming a professional wrestling while meeting an outlaw. The two form a great friendship bond! A beautiful chemistry develops between actors Shia LaBeouf and Zack Gottsagen.Emotionally, there are some heartwarming and magical scenes reminiscent of such films as Rain Main, Dominique and Eugene, and Midnight Cowboy. If only the film had stayed with that kind of emotional intensity, we would of had a modern classic!Instead, the film starts falling apart when the caregiver of the home Eleanor (Dakota Johnson) where Zack is institutionalized, finds Tyler (LaBeouf) and Zack (Gottsagen) and completely violates her roles as a care giver. She doesn't take Zack back to the facility, she doesn't report Tyler for breaking the law, and worse, no one with Down Syndrome would be able to survive for days without their medication, being able to swim, walk around in their underwear without being noticed and reported by the authorities. The unbelievable actions of Zack's caregiver, even falling in love with Tyler without explanation, and the whole wrestling scenes turn a potential classic film into a kind of ""Hee Haw"" movie. I found the country music to be very annoying. And the ending was really rushed. ""OK we made it to Florida"" end credits. Where is the memorable tug at your heartstrings ending that makes movie magic like the movie examples listed above? It is only found in the first half of The Peanut Butter Falcon.A more believable script would have given The Peanut Butter Falcon the classic status that Shia LaBeouf and Zack Gottsagen try so hard to give to the film!

The acting, across the board, was extremely good and is one of the main strengths of the film. It will be very interesting to see where Shia's career can go from here.Satisfying story elements give this film plenty of rewatchability. The setting is also a positive for this film...it takes place almost entirely outdoors which makes you feel like you are truly on a journey with these characters. Not too many films have a sense of adventure quite like this one.My one negative, which can be seen as a pretty big one, is the sense of realism. Some of the events in the film and character actions seemed a bit unrealistic. It didn't hurt my viewing experience much, but at times I felt like somethings felt a bit bizarre.

The story is extremely simple and not very original, it could have improved with a much more thorough characterization, instead each one of the characters feel like the background of the trip rather than vice versa even though each of them has an interesting story to tell. Fortunately this is partially hidden thanks to the great and, what seems to be, honest synergy between the actors and, therfore, the characters.

119,ccamp89,Strong 2 // A film cannot stand on intentions alone,4,24 August 2019,"**Mild Spoilers**I'd like to give this film a positive review. It's low in budget, pure in heart, and earnest in intent. It's a film about friendship, acceptance, following your dreams and staying true to yourself. What's not to like? A lot, unfortunately. Intent will only carry a film so far, and it can't excuse a non-sensical plot filled with contrivances and clichés. A retirement home sends a key employee on a wild goose chase, with the company shuttle no less? And the employee happens upon that goose on a random riverbank seemingly in the middle of nowhere? And then she just decides to go with them instead of calling the police in a situation that's at worst a kidnapping and at best just plain dangerous? And she doesn't even rethink this decision after they're nearly shot and killed by third party pursuers seemingly intent on revenge? I know we're going for the heartstrings here and, I'll admit, there are moments that succeed in strumming some chords. But these moments ultimately succumb to a nagging banality, and the meat-and-potatoes filmmaking doesn't do anything to add some much-needed spice. The cherry on top is a puzzlingly abrupt ending that fails to deliver on the catharsis the film seems to be aiming for. An unfortunate misfire on a well-meaning premise.Strong 2/5",The Peanut Butter Falcon
120,C-Younkin,As wonderful as you've heard,9,4 September 2019,"The Peanut Butter Falcon tells of the friendship between a mentally challenged man named Zack and a down on his luck fisherman named Tyler.Both these guys bandits in their own way, they team up and head down river Mark Twain style, just here from North Carolina to Florida to help Zack get to meet his favorite wrestler and maybe be one himself.And right off the bat this movie gets representation points.You don't get many movies that really get what it's like to be mentally disabled but this brings that out super well.Zack's predicament is one of many where the world really doesn't know what to do with people with down syndrome. Yes there are people who treat him cruelly but then there are also the ones who treat him in a workman-like way- who baby him and put him some place out of the way.The world is trying to phase out the word retard but in one great scene here the movie shows that society still sees these people as less than and they need to reassess that.One who deserves loads of credit here is Zack Gottsagen, who i'm not even overrating in saying I feel is a front runner for a best supporting actor oscar right now.Zack's enthusiasm for wrestling is infectious, his personality is funny, his dreams and his goals become instantly rootable, his need for something more is universal and heartwarming. This is not just being, but also great acting.His rapport with Shia LeBouf is terrific. LeBouf also has not been this good in a while. He takes on Tyler's feelings of isolation and regret.This is a movie of two people, one feels he is not a good person because the world has made him feel less, the other because he has given up on himself because of past mistakes.Another just beautiful scene between the two focuses on what makes a good and bad person.Their time together definitely does bring to mind bayou movies like Mud, or classic characters of Mark Twain. They get into trouble, there are some really suspenseful close calls-one involving a sea boat is more suspenseful than most of the movies this summer.But there is genuine affection there too. They both need each other, they both learn things from each other.This is so lovably told that even the unbelievable logic, especially what happens in the last act of the movie, doesn't matter so much because you love them and love seeing them win.Peanut Butter Falcon is as beautiful a movie as you've probably heard people say it is and if you haven't seen it yet, you're missing one of the top films of the year.",The Peanut Butter Falcon
121,writenamehere,Confusing,2,16 May 2020,"Peanut Butter Falcon is labelled as a Huckleberry Finn type adventure, but it quickly turns into an emotionally abusive self nightmare. The acting is solid and genuine, so genuine that it exposes the underling sneering tone of the story. The level of sarcastic unreality is so extreme by the final 20 minutes that you wonder if all the characters actually died at the beginning, and this was all some kind of purgatorial hallucination. This is the kind of film that would've been made in 1980, before giant leaps in mainstream social awareness occurred. ""Life Goes On"" was light years ahead of this, 25 years ago.Maybe they were trying to say that not only has nothing changed, but prejudices have gotten worse, and that only a fool tries to hope?

123,TheCasualReviewer,As satisfying as a Snickers bar,8,26 February 2020,"SYNOPSIS:
Zak (Zack Gottsagen) finally escapes the nursing home to find his way and meet his favorite wrestler. On the way, he meets Tyler (Shia LeBeouf) And kindles a relationship as he helps Zak on his journey.REVIEW:
I am so disappointed that Shia LeBeouf received absolutely no recognition at the 2020 Oscars. He was snubbed for both this beautiful performance and his attention-grabbing performance in ""Honey Boy."" Either way this is still one of the best films of 2020. There is so much heart in this film and I absolutely love the writing. You truly feel the connection that's built between Zak and Tyler. You really want to see them accomplish the goal they set out. I also really liked Dakota Johnson in this film. Not typically a fan, but she brings a solid opposition to LeBeouf. A relatable character who feels they are being of genuine help, but doesn't realize they're keeping someone from excelling. Then it all really comes together nicely at the end and none of it feels forced unbelievable. This is all capsulated within a 90-minute film that satisfies as good as a snickers bar. 8.6/10.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

125,roger-99-171599,A soul cleansing experience!,8,5 September 2019,"While running away together, but for different reasons and directions, two abandoned young men are invited by a blind preacher to hear the Gospel and take a deep dive into the river. Processing an unlikely friendship, of mutual support and reliance, as well as interests and goals to find freedom, they are called to reconnect with the Creator in order to shape and strengthen themselves. The hot-headed, rebellious fisherman Tyler (Shia Labeouf) refuses the improvised baptism, convincing his runaway-partner Zak (Zack Gottsagen), a young man with Down Syndrome, to go into the river, despite his inability to swim or even to understand the ritual. After the spiritual encounter, those inspirational words continue to fill their hearts with hope, as they surrender entirely to the Almighty. It is deeply represented as they leave the preacher's territory, while reflecting on themselves; while in movement, on the road, the rays of sun shine upon them, as they touch each other's face, as a response with such grace and joy for being made accordingly to His own image. This moving spiritual experience (one that will definitely bring tears) gives them motivation to pursuit their goals: Tyler must avoid a pair of thugs (including Oscar nominee John Hawkes) with whom he had a crab-merchandise dispute, as he leaves the state in search of opportunities; Zak had always dreamt of becoming a wrestler, and plans to get trained at a school managed by an iconic wrestler (Thomas Haden Church). Their lives are suddenly connected, as they find familiar comfort to relief their disappointment and abandonment: Tyler is haunted by the tragic death of his brother, and Zak was left alone at the clinic-home, rejected by his family. Conceived by writers-directors Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz, in their outstanding feature debut collaboration, this heartbreaking, humorous, crowd-pleasing fugitive story is certainly one of the most accomplished indie films of the year. The ""Thelma & Louise"" structure works efficiently, as a road movie on the highways, on the river, or by foot, the pair is running from their realities and dangers in order to find themselves. The music, editing and stupendous cinematography, capture the hopelessness and despair of its characters (including a fine performance by Dakota Johnson as the social worker responsible to rescue Zak), and the idyllic, mysterious, remote and serene landscapes of the wilderness, creating an absorbing, poetical and insightful atmosphere.
Shia Labeouf is incredibly convincing and mature, completely different from his ""Transformers"" phase, and newcomer Zack Gottsagen is a revelation, confirming his confidence and resistance to battle the obstacles of his condition. Winner of the Audience Award at SXSW, and named Best Film at both Heartland and Nantucket Film Festivals, it's a fresh, pleasant, humble and powerful cleansing soul experience.",The Peanut Butter Falcon
126,Kirollos-Noah,A blast from start to finish!,10,10 November 2019,"The Peanut Butter Falcon was written and directed by Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz, and stars Shia LaBeouf, Dakota Johnson and Zack Gottsagen.The movie tells the story of Zac, played by Gottsagen, who runs from his care home to make his dream of becoming a wrestler come true, in his journey he meets Tyler, played by LaBeouf, who's also running from people who wants him dead.. their road combines with Eleanor's, the nice nursing home employee who's looking for Zac to bring him back home.I watched this movie knowing nothing but the cast, I only heard of it once or twice, but I didn't know anything about the story, I didn't even watch the trailer for this movie... And I'm so happy to say this: This movie is a blast from start to finish, I had the time of my life watching this movie, it just put a smile on my face during the whole runtime!The Peanut Butter Falcon discusses some serious actual problems, how simple things we do can effect a guy with a Down syndrome, even if we don't say ""that word"" it still hurts, our action, the way we deal with them.. our look at them, simple things we might NOT even care of! The movie even has a scene of LaBeouf and Johnson while Labeouf is telling her how her actions were looking like, how she was offending Zac, even though she didn't even call him ""that"".. the movie discusses that in a beautiful and a deep way, in so many different ways.The movie also discusses other things about dreams and how we choose to achieve them, even though in some scenes it lost realism, it lost it to show us that we tell ourselves that that is impossible, and I won't achieve that because of whatever I might think my problems are, it lost it on purpose to show the audience that nothing is impossible! There's a scene where The Salt Water Redneck, played by Thomas Haden Church, was talking to Zac about a move he used to do, and how it was fake because it wasn't possible, but it was Zac's dream to learn how to do.. I don't want to spoil anything, but later on we get to know that it's possible, though in real life it's really not that easy to do all of a sudden, but the movie does that in a way that it's beautiful and relatable, more than an illogic thing! That being said because I saw people nitpicking this as a flaw, and I think it's because they didn't get what the movie was trying the say at the end, they didn't get the movie at all, because the movie didn't go in a cliched way to say ""hey, nothing is impossible"", it chose some kind of a fantasy to show that, and for me that was a good and creative way to show it!What makes this movie really works is the cast, everyone was outstanding in this movie, especially LaBeouf, he gave us his best performance ever, it's one of the best performances of the year, he was funny, emotional and lovable at times, his character also has a great backstory that was shown in a beautifully shot way! Gottsagen is also amazing in this movie, it's his first movie, but he's so talented, he also was funny, emotional, deep, adorable and lovable too, he makes you feel for him, and routing for him in his journey, and wanting him to succeed on his mission, and that isn't an easy thing to do in your first movie ever, but Gottsagen did that amazingly and with so much talent! Dakota Johnson also gave us one of her -if not the- best performance, her character has also one of these scenes where she tells LaBeouf how her job is hard, and how she feels about it, but even though she keeps doing that... Though she's rich, was mentioned in one scene, and graduated from a very good and expensive university, she still wants to do that job instead of working at well-known companies and getting well-paid, that could also be inspiring, to do whatever you want, no matter how much you get paid, or whoever your family is, you just follow your heart and you'd do great stuff at what you love, that's also mentioned in a scene where Zac was telling Tyler how he loves Eleanor, and how she's great at her job.This movie is also beautifully shot, Nilson and Schwartz did a great job capturing the countryside, with deep impact, and amazing cinematography! Each scene was so amazing, and it's so good to see and pick those messages -because this movie has plenty of messages- without making characters saying much about them, or making them obvious, that made the movie very impressive and interesting!It's hard to be nitpicky on a movie like this, because the only thing I was gonna say as a flaw the movie turns out to have something deeper than what it was giving us, and that is the lack of realism during some parts of the movie, but it turned out to be something way more beautiful than what I could actually think of!The Peanut Butter Falcon is a beautiful movie, well-shot and has one of the best performances of the year by its 3 leads, with amazing messages at the end to get out with, this is definitely one of the best movie of this year!The Peanut Butter Falcon of course gets an A+! It's the third movie this year that I give an A+ to, 2019 is such a great year for movies, and I'm so happy about that.The Peanut Butter Falcon, a must-see guys, if you missed it in theaters, it's now on BluRay everywhere, hurry up and get your copy, it's definitely worth your time, because it's really sad to see a movie that great, and that there's no one talking about it and everyone is just talking about movies like Avengers: Endgame or Shazam! and leaving such masterpieces like that, because trust me, there're so many movie like that and you just don't care anymore, because of the over-advertising of the high budget movies!Thank you, guys as always for reading my reviews, and if you liked this, you can click on my name up above and see all of my reviews.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

Turns out it's one of the best films I've seen this year and really does a great job at making you feel for this young kid with a dream of becoming a wrestler.I went in expecting nothing but was blown away by the emotion felt throughout and the way it conveys the struggles that certain people with disabilities and particularly downsyndrome have to deal with and fight to overcome.It really felt like such a unique film and something that will not be easily forgotten. From the secret handshake to Zak telling Shia that he'll use all his birthday wishes on him it was so heartwarming to see. The last few scenes were a roller-coaster as you see Zak achieving his dream of wrestling and pulling off his big move only for Shia to be attacked and you're left for a short while not knowing if he's OK and almost begging that it will have a happy ending.Truly great film, one of the best when it comes to emotion and heart and it goes down as one of the best I've ever seen.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

133,FixedYourEnding,"Wholehearted filmmaking, but falls a bit short",7,18 November 2019,"Zak (Zack Gottsagen) is a Down Syndrome person with a great positive view of life, however due to him not having any caring family, the state has put him in a retirement home under the care of a young nurse, Eleanor (Dakota Johnson). Everyone knows it's not the right place for him, but his fate is seemingly doomed.
He decides to escape with nothing on him other than a pair of underwear but fate creates an unlikely friendship between him and Tyler (Shia LaBeouf), a lost sole who lives in the shadow of his older brother who died in a car accident that was, as much as we can tell, Tyler's fault.
They begin in a journey to Florida, chased by some bad fellows Tyler has irated before (Duncan and Ratboy) and also by Eleanor who is looking for Zak.
There are also 2 cameos by Jake ""the snake"" Roberts and Mankind (Samson) which were a great casting choice for this movie small wresting bit.
The director chose to end this movie on a happy note and have the friendship story unfold itself to a lifelong friendship, however I could still not agree with the seemingly only one dreamy scene in the movie in which Zak atomic-throws Samson in the air and out of the ring. Since the rest of the movie tries to picture a realistic situation and the life of people with Down Syndrome, I think Sam could fly off the ring in a more realistic fashion (like a slip); or, Zak can leave the ring altogether (which maybe symbolize him understand wrestling career is not realistic for him) and actually save Tyler from Duncan and Ratboy. I would like that much better than the hospital scare-scene at the end, this can show that although Down Syndrome people cannot be the best wrestlers or the best swimmers etc, they can do good in the world, and even help saves other people's lives and bring people together.
Overall great job by the director and the actors. it's definitely an enjoyable movie however it is not a must watch.

140,darrenbjones,A heartwarming tale.,8,18 July 2020,"Peanut Butter Falcon is a heartwarming, life affirming road trip movie, in the vein of Huckleberry Finn. It's not a demanding movie but it is great and that Zack and Shia have formed a friendship in real life is clear on screen in the chemistry between the two. The whole cast sparkles and elevated what could easily have been an obvious tug on the heartstrings hallmark movie into something magical.The three main characters are all damaged people, Zach is kept in an elderly care home where he is expected to live out his life, treated as a child. Tyler is on a self destructive downward spiral over the guilt he feels for his brother's death in a car crash while Eleanor is a young widow, trying to find a purpose. The three form a wonderful family unit with Zack able to bring out the best in each of them as they help him achieve his goals.
Tyler is on the run from fishermen who's livelihood he has been stealing from, Zack is on the run from the care home and Eleanor, who works at the home, is trying to find him and bring him back. All three end up on a journey of redemption as they end up helping Zack reach the 'Salt Water Redneck's School of Wrestling' where he intends to train to become a professional wrestler.
The film has been given accolades for its sensitive and realistic portrayal of people with Down Syndrome and the writer and director team of Tyler Nelson and Michael Schwartz were inspired to make the film after meeting Zack Gottsagen at a camp for actors with disabilities. The care they took with the script means this story is never pandering or patronising, even at its most whimsical.
Shia Lebouf and Dakota Johnson are excellent alongside first time actor Zack Gottsagen. Bruce Dern, Thomas Hayden Church, John Hawkes and more ably support in a film that was a commercial success as well as a critical one.
This is a warm-hearted and heart warming story about family, friendship and healing. It's well worth anyone's time.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

Strike one. A gentleman directly behind us managed to successfully smuggle multiple grocery bags of food and beverage contraband into the theater and had no reservations rifling through them every five minutes, all while resting his bare feet atop our neighboring seat.

Let me just state the obvious: not all ""normal"" people are good actors/actresses. Likewise, not everybody with Down's is a good actor (even when they play a typecast). Obviously, Shia & Dakota are top notch talents (far better than you or I or 99% of the human race). But Zack is not a talent; I cannot imagine him playing a regular role as he is not even believable/credible when playing a typecast. That said, if you feel that he (and people like him) have been screwed by nature and therefore deserve our sympathy-- which I wholeheartedly agree -- it might not matter much weather he is a good actor or not. It may be enough that he is out and visible -- unlike 99% of his peers who are 100% dependent on their parents. That is a silver lining and some will choose to see that and some will see the sad truth behind it. Words to the wise: Nature is not your friend. Only the young and the lucky believe otherwise. But neither youth nor luck lasts forever.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

170,thetyvonlesure,The Uplifting Peanut Butter Falcon,7,6 September 2019,"Peanut Butter Falcon shines as one of the most heart-warming films of 2019. The portrayal of People with Intellectual Disabilities are typically done by Actors who do not have Intellectual Disabilities. Peanut Butter Falcon is the exception. The film stars Zack Gottsagen in a ground-breaking role in which he portrays a 22 year old boy with Down syndrome. Gottsagen has Down syndrome, himself. Gottsagen shines bright in the role of Zack, carrying the film as the lead. The film costars Shia LaBeouf as Tyler. LaBeouf compliments Gottsagen with his superb acting, strengthening the emotion of this film. LaBeouf continues to show why he's a great actor, despite previous blockbuster flubs.Peanut Butter Falcon is an emotional rollercoaster that reiterates the significance of caring for others no matter where they come from. The story is well written, and accurately portrays the plight that many with Intellectual Disabilities face. The bond shared between Zack and Tyler is authentic. The adventure Zack takes to become the Peanut Butter Falcon is well-written, with brief, sometimes unnoticeable moments of cheesiness. Despite the cheesiness, this is an inspirational story that will undoubtedly bring tears of joy and sorrow to eyes.The cinematography is good, with some minor flubs in technicality. The soundtrack is bad, and the music dilutes some of the emotional moments within the film. Outside of the exchanges between Tyler and Zack and the key moments of the film, the dialogue is below average. Dakota Johnson holds the film back with her poor acting. The characters are well developed and relatable, with some areas of corniness/fantasy.Overall, Peanut Butter Falcon is a good, emotional film with an inspirational story that many could learn from and relate to. Zack Gottsagen is a Star in the making. The film is flawed and has areas that could use improvement, but overall it is an uplifting matinee.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

I don't want to say too much about the plot, but it centers around Zak, a man with down syndrome who wants to become a wrestler, and Tyler, an outlaw on the run. The movie just has this charm, it definitely has cliche moments and a plot that isn't original, but it's done really well and with so much charm. The actors all have great chemistry which is what really pushes this film forward. The cinematography is really unique here. The film is shot and has a plot that's like a fable, but the sets and specifics are grounded in reality. The screenplay is really well written and does a great job at developing these characters. The movie is kind of a feel-good film, but like every feel-good film there's still tension throughout and I think that's done well here. Overall, I really enjoyed this film, and I'd give it an 8.3/10.",The Peanut Butter Falcon
174,imjaredross,Heartfelt and Simple,7,1 October 2019,"The Peanut Butter Falcon showcases that dreams really can come true for anyone. Zak is a young man with Down syndrome that has dreams of becoming a professional wrestler.Similar to the real life actor portraying him, newcomer Zack Gottsagen who's Dream has been to become an actor. Well in this film both dreams are realized.The Peanut Butter Falcon is a film with so much heart and terrific performances from its leafs. Not only does Gottsagen get to shine in a role of a lifetime, but Shia LeBeouf himself gives a career defining performance. They're chemistry is fantastic and as you go on this journey with you see their friendship grow not only as character but as performers. This is such a delight, to see someone with a disability being able to do something like this and be so funny and witty all the same.The story is more or less a retelling of Huckleberry Finn and sticks close to the story, with a few changes here and there. However, the story plays second fiddle in this film to its characters which feel so real an well defined. Watching their bond is honestly one of the biggest treats of the film.This is a really good film. Simple, but sweet and has a lot of heart. Sometimes it might be too whimsical for its own good, but it's all in the right place. I'm glad I got to finally see this. It was truly worth the wait.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

Let's just say, I'm impressed! The relationship this film creates between Zack and Shia is lovely and reinstates some faith into the world we live in. I feel that the most important message this film portrays is to refuse to allow a person's disability to define them, if someone hasn't been allowed to discover their limits then no one will ever know what they could have achieved. Both Zack and Shia show a clear understanding of their characters and the best scenes in this film are their conversations together 1 on 1.

Decent acting and pretty well made.Unfortunately nearly every thing that happens in it, is highly implausible, right from the get go. Appreciate that stories have to bend the rules to get a plot, but this one is just fall of absurdities - And it gets annoying.The scene at the end when our down syndrome Zak, during a wrestling bout, picks up and throws Jake the Snake Roberts out of the ring and half way across the USA is one of the most laughable in movie history.That said, it's a nice warm film.

180,kaneeddy,One of the underrated gems of 2019,8,31 January 2020,"I found the Peanut Butter Falcon to be an engaging and heartwarming drama that presents some excellent performances from the three leads: Shia Labeouf, Dakota Johnson and Zack Gottsagen who gives an excellent debut performance, the themes it tackles along the run time of the film are handled with care and in the right way, that only further enhances the film. I found the lead characters to all be relatable, and likeable all having different goals and personalities, who build relationships over the small things that link them together, which shows the strength of the writing behind the film.However, I found that some decisions made for the film, like having a pair of antagonists to be weak at some points, I felt as if the drama between the characters, their struggles and the continuously evolving relationships to be enough to carry the film to the point where I felt that having antagonists felt pointless in some ways. I also thought the ending was rushed and felt a little abrupt.Overall, I found the Peanut Butter Falcon to be such a heartwarming surprising film that I believe more people need to see. Apart from a couple of flaws that could have been ironed out I really enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone who wants something new to watch.",The Peanut Butter Falcon
181,unkommon,A Charming Lil Film,6,7 April 2021,"While certainly there are films that deal with the hardships of disability in a more meaningful and authentic way, this movie certainly has heart. It may not be the most involved or expressive story, but it achieves its goals and is certainly a feelgood flick. The antagonists are rather baseless and exist solely to create an antagonizing force (not necessarily something that was even needed), but then again most classical adventures Americana have some sort of driving villain. All-in-all, this movie may not go down with the likes of the feelgood classics like The Goonies, Top Gun, or E. T. the Extra-Terrestrial, it certainly has its charm and will probably be thrown on a coming of age playlist 15 or so years in the future for budding youth the same way Nickelodeon and TNT would throw on those classics in the late 90s and early 00s, but likely won't have the same staying power.

184,lightheartedbeing,"Real Acceptance, a Joy to watch",10,8 September 2019,"I haven't had this much fun in a movie since forever. It's spirit and humor hit the mark so many times, the whole audience was so engaged, it was fantastic. I think that two themes stand out, grief and the family you make. The three main characters are dealing with lots of grief. It's not overplayed at all, but is the energy behind all their journeys which brings them together. It's not possibly to say enough about Zack's acting and bringing so much to the film as the center of it. He was really pitch perfect. LeBoef's Tyler is shattered after the loss of his brother and he's a real mess when their paths cross. What becomes such an endearing process as he surrenders to traveling with this young man is how clear it was that he knew how to be a big brother to him, coach, mentor, yes, but they become family. It felt like there was something very genuine, bigger than just the film being made that happened between the two men. The male bonding was also really great, they both so needed one another and made a very real connection. There are some great points made in the film about how we treat people, from violence to sacrifice and caring, to silly. Many moments seemed so spontaneous and genuine. Laughed lots, had tears well up at one point, and shouted at one point. I never do that at movies! Loved the whole journey, the character's growth and change. While it may not be the best movie making, plot, writing, something very special happened here that transcends the usual films out there. It's kind of in a category of its own. Watch with your heart, not a critical eye, and you'll have a great ride, a sail along the outer banks with characters that are on the fringes of the world that reach right in and pluck the heart strings. If we could find our way with one another in our journeys downstream with deep acceptance, realness, and the kind of unvarnished presence of these characters, we'd be living in the world our hearts know is possible. The human spirit is really something.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

The story feels like reading a book about an adventure that anyone would want to take. Kudos for including an actor with actual down syndrome.Pros: Shia LeBeouf plays an excellent role in being tough, down on his luck while showing his emotions at just the right times. One of the most underrated actors in movies/tv today.
Feels like a mostly refreshing adventure from start to finish.Cons: The movie ends abruptly, guess that's a sacrifice from the rather short run time of just around 90 minutes.
Some moments that don't necessarily feel like they fit, the scene with the antagonists break up the film's feeling of hope/love/family.

A good thing? After the conclusion of this very enjoyable piece, I actually wish it had given me a tad more.You get to know Zak's characteristics throughout the movie, he's a smart cookie for sure. Shia, my word, he is either terrible or very watchable, he most certainly sets camp in the latter in TPBF. Again you are provided glimpses of his past which makes him who is is today.Between them, my word, what an unexpected laugh out loud buddy movie you are served up. Dakota Johnson and the supporting cast are far more than adequate and there are other lesser characters you again wish you had a bit more time with.I found myself, apart from laughs, wanting to be moved a little bit more by this movie, I am a sucker for a bleary eye now and then, this sadly missed that mark which I felt would have been attained with a few carefully selected scenes being extended or even some more poignant moments between the two leads and the supporting cast.However, I also completely get it if the writer/director didn't want to pull those hearstrings deliberately and risk straying into 'sympathy tears', so, considering I am really quite stingy with my ratings, as the cast is absolutely spot on, the mood of the film is perfectly pitched and I found myself glued to the screen every second, it deserves an 8/10 from me, maybe more of a 7.5 if I could.Enjoy.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

Together, these two men form a fast friendship as they try to outrun their pasts.What worked:
The chemistry between LaBeouf and Gottsagen was amazing. You could tell these two had a great time filming. Their acting alone would make this movie 10/10 and well worth watching.What didn't:
I would have loved to hear the casting conversations for Dakota Johnson who plays a caregiver looking for Gottsagen. I actually liked her in this, but thought the writers butchered her role by ramming her budding romance with LeBeouf down our throats. Also, not to nitpick or anything, but how did the fishermen who were chasing LaBeouf find him? There was no indication they had any idea what route he was taking. Finally, if the writers were trying to go for unpredictable outcomes, this was not it.Overall, great story and acting by LaBeouf and Gottsagen, but there were some questionable directorial decisions. You should watch it nonetheless.",The Peanut Butter Falcon
213,KillerRomance,Not all as it cracked up to be. Sorry! I'll explain why,5,18 June 2020,"The Peanut Butter Falcon is one of those movies that Film Critics are calling a ""masterpiece"" and you wonder what the fuss is about.
The outline of the story set in Savannah, Georgia is about Tyler (Shia Lebeouf) who set fire to a pier after he got fired from a fishing job and comes across runaway Zack a Down's syndrome guy who is into professional wrestling and wants to become one and to find his hero Saltwater Red Neck, but then Elenore (Dakota Johnson) tags on as a support worker to find Zack and a romantic interest to Tyler and they go on a quest to find this wrestler.The script is not bad but nothing to rave above, the dialogue is just basic English and I can't believe how short the movie is when I saw I had 31 minutes left. The movie feels rushed and didn't have more to tell at a point so that is why there has to be romance between Shia LeBeouf and Elenore otherwise there is nothing if you boil it down.
It does remind about the dark corners of the caring industry having a few months of experience myself where workers are unethical in attitude and the movie captured that which I applaud.
Unfortunately this movie had fell flat when there was a particular unrealistic scene of Zack looking like the 1979 Superman movie when Clark Kent was a Baby and looks identical to that infant, even the hair LOL, and everything was going great for Dakota Johnson then guess what shows up? It's fluffy with a pink cheetah print and it's metal. She will never live this down but it is the director's fault on this suggestion. Shia LeBeouf's ""outlaw"" character is no outlaw, just a disgruntled employee. The ending will leave you with a ""is that all?"" Type of feeling and you ask yourself 'won't it be better if they howled at the Sun at the crepuscular scene when the credits roll?' but can't have everything I suppose.
People are giving high hopes on Peanut Butter Falcon but it is to hollow for me, Shia LeBeouf is not bad but no show stealer so I won't be patting him on the back with one serious performance, and what's up with the constant spitting on the boat, on the water etc? That is not what being a man is about in Georgia or anyplace, a stereotypical behaviour on Males then LeBeouf preaches about human rights on Zack.
There scenes of Savannah, Georgia that are well shot in Peanut Butter Falcon but I know a better feel good movie that does not need blockbuster CGI and Guns with great scenes of New York with a Blind colonel called Scent of a Woman 1993 movie where you can feel New York and feel for the characters. I know a lot goes on in a city than a village but Scent of a Woman is more elaborate, more character development, more heart warming than Peanut Butter Falcon. Another beautiful humanity movie better than PBF is Queen of Katwe about a Ugandan Girl discovering her skills in Chess as she helping her entire destitute family and goes through obstacles to do so.
Sorry, I said it. If PBF wins an Oscar it will be a worry because it's not much of an engaging movie with something missing about it, just an average film and if movie makers want to note to not let PBF be a focus movie. Choose Queen of Katwe and Scent of a Woman instead for inspiration.",The Peanut Butter Falcon
214,bp29,"Blurry camera, geography errors, and plot holes",6,25 August 2019,"I had high hopes of this movie, the critics and general audiences have given it really good reviews, however there are some things that didn't work,
The camera work was really blurry, so bad a lot of the time the actors' faces were blurred, maybe to do with the 20,000 dollar budget??
Also, being from North Carolina and familiar with the Outer Banks it is a thin strip of land with sounds on one side and the Atlantic ocean on the other, not marshland as this movie portrays, I looked it up and see it was filmed in Savannah GA, that could have been passable if the movie took place in another place in N.C. however not the OBX

216,adaringdo-1,A movie you aren't allowed to dislike,5,21 September 2019,"I found this movie initially entertaining, but it quickly devolved into a trite and then absurd piece of fiction devoid of common sense. The crux of this picture is friendship, and that was well done up to a point, but it became self indulgent and manipulative of the audience -- something I find sinful. The characters were generally non-redeeming except to someone who worships the mentally challenged, emotionally defective, and criminally inclined. This narcissistic piece is custom made for leftists, devoid of rationality, (though it did have some endearing moments) and, script-wise, rewarded those in our culture who take, destroy, and whine about everyone else's privilege while embarking on a self-centered escapade of discovery where they eventually are rewarded for being stupid. There were numerous scenes that presented rural men as animalistic morons, but elevated idiots to near godhood. The lone female is nieve and generally unbelievable. The story line, overall, avoids responsibility like so many Hollywood types today, and bathes in forced emotion.",The Peanut Butter Falcon
217,mickgmovies,Not your average escape movie,9,5 December 2020,"I'll start off by saying that this movie left me with a smile on my face. It really is an endearing movie - made with authenticity, a wonderfully simple yet powerful story and some great onscreen chemistry.It is at it's essence - an escape movie.Zack escaping the system that's labeled and limited him, and Tyler escaping his past. Their journey forward together is one of wonder - capturing a rare onscreen vulnerability and bond between men - one that is all too missing in our often macho society.The story twists and turns as their journey together unfolds - but never strays too far off course from it's essence. A story about giving each other time, support, love and respect as fellow human beings.The cinematography, supporting cast and great music just adds to the experience.A must-see if you value simple stories made well.",The Peanut Butter Falcon
218,redcanofevil,Fun & Heartwarming,9,28 November 2019,"A touching tale of a guy with down syndrome running away from a retirement home in hopes of pursuing a career in wrestling.When I say its a touching tale I mean it. Everyone gave a very good performance and had bad guys that you truly hate, something that has become quite rare these days. It doesn't get said often but Shia Labeouf is a fantastic actor and hugely underrated. Even Dakota Johnson who I don't usually see as a big name gave a very adequate performance. But the breakout star has to be Zack Gottsagen who plays the lead character with down syndrome. He was absolutely brilliant and I could easily see him getting some nominations.The story may seem simple but that's because it is. It is basically a feel good Mark Twain type adventure story that is worth every buck. The cinematography is delightful, the score is riveting and the locales are just beautiful. Its extremely heartwarming and no spoiler but I've never been glad to see a character make it in the end.It does have the worst CGI I've seen in my entire life but its only in one scene and it's at the very end. And I mean on par with our Bangla cinema CGI. But does it take away any of the fun? Absolutely not. It doesn't have any pacing issue and gives you enough reason to be personally invested in the main characters. The script is outlandish but in a charming way and is not afraid of being visceral at times. The script blends humor, grit and fairytale wonder to winning effect, that is what makes it a full package.The Peanut Butter Falcon is the type of movie that doesn't come very often, so savor it while you can. I swear I wanted to be on the raft with all 3 characters so bad even after being a total shut-in, it seemed that fun and enjoyable. I feel truly blessed and pleased to have seen this movie, especially when it almost slipped off my radar. Just watch it and you can thank me later, don't let it slip by.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

221,Sickpuppy365,Peanut butter jelly time,7,15 October 2020,"If you think this movie is about a wrestling obsessed special needs person who tags along with an antisocial loner in an effort to outrun his awkward care-giver for long enough to become a WWF superstar... Then that's OK... It's actually two movies in one... The people who saw the one I just described, are no doubt those who give it low ratings, you know, for bad dialogue and such, because a good ole boy, a debutant and a kid with Down's syndrome should be constantly expounding their deliberations on the existential fallacies corrupting Western civilization... In ancient Greek... Or something...
I saw the second movie... The one about a loving brother consumed with guilt and self-loathing, hell bent on a path of inevitable self-destruction, who reluctantly regains his humanity just long enough to save a young dreamer from a sealed fate where even the person closest to him, his care-giver, is slowly suffocating him in the name of love, where that same care-giver's eyes may be abruptly ripped open to the realization that there is more to living than being alive, safe and normal...

In an era where there's an obsession with the next big budget block buster and multi-million dollar special effects, the Peanut Butter Falcon shows what can be achieved with a good story, cinema photography and solid acting performances.

But this movie was heartwarming, funny, and certainly original. The chemistry between Shia LeBeouf, Dakota Johnson, and Zack Gottsagen felt very genuine and natural, not to mention likable.The first half of the film was mainly a road movie with Shia LeBeouf and Zack Gottsagen's characters, and it was enjoyable and funny as all get out. There were some moments of character development and flashbacks that were very tastefully done that utilized subtlety to show Shia LeBeouf character's background. And Zack Gottsagen's character felt very natural and likeable, with layers to his performance and connection with wrestling that showed a lot of characterization.Not to mention, the cinematography and music was very captivating and gave the film some subtle and charming personality. The only real issue I had with it was that the pacing lagged a bit about ¾ of the way through. But it quickly found its way again and became pretty unpredictable as to where the story was going. Overall, this movie was so enjoyable, heartwarming and it was a great character movie and road movie that truly felt like a breath of fresh air.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

It wasn't full of action, nor special effects, but instead it told a story, brilliantly and with heart. The acting was phenomenal! I've never cared for Shia Labeouf too much prior to this film, but wow, he was amazing! He captured the character completely, and was mesmerizing! Dakota Johnson was great too, and it was absolutely wonderful to see her in a film with heart, vs. the 50 Shades movies. She has a much better range than I ever knew! And the heartwarming scene stealer was Zack Gottsagen, who proved that everyone deserves a life of their own, filled with dignity! I thought this was a movie primarily for children, but I stand corrected: it's a movie for anyone who's ever been down on their luck, anyone who's ever had a dream, or anyone who's ever felt different.

234,gazgil,This emperor is not wearing any clothes,5,13 September 2020,"Surely in several years time we'll be asking ""just what were we thinking?"". Sub-plots which went nowhere. A nonsensical plot with cringeworthy dialogue between romantic leads and a finale which is ridiculous and sudden.Everyone is tripping over themselves to praise this movie. It seems the lavish praise is based on having a Down Syndrome person in the 'lead' role, and I'll admit, he was great. Shia also nailed his role. An immensely unlikable person, but portrayed well nonetheless. But the praise must stop there.And for those reviewers who hailed this as a ""family film"" let me bring out one or two points:Aside from the considerable bad language (which I guess is normal these days) Shia's character killed his brother in what seemed like an alcohol related accident, but hey, it means he's a more conflicted individual who conquers his own demons.He also commits several crimes, including theft and arson, but hey, the guys he had it in for were lowlifes anyway so they had it coming. Yey!He punches a kid in the face, like really punches this kid out, but hey, the kid was bullying a disadvantaged person so again, yey!A woman for no inconceivable reason on the planet decides to join these two on their escapade instead of involving the appropriate authorities, but hey it's the girl from 50 shades so who cares?Not sure what your family values are but don't invite me over for dinner. Yes, this emperor is not wearing only clothes but everyone's too ""woke"" to notice.",The Peanut Butter Falcon
235,MovieTim14,Reminds you of the power of Cinema,9,4 September 2019,"I'm a huge fan of franchise films the likes of Star Wars and the Avengers. But for all those films' spectacle and grand storytelling and larger than life characters, sometimes it takes a smaller, quieter film to remind you what the true power of cinema is. It takes a film like ""The Peanut Butter Falcon.""""The Peanut Butter Falcon"" is a very humanistic tale of Zak and Tyler, two young men whose lives intersect by chance. Zak, who has Down Syndrome, dreams of escaping his life in a nursing home and becoming a professional wrestler like his hero, the Salt Water Redneck. Tyler is troubled, and left trying to find his place in the world after the death of his hero - his brother. Both characters are well-fleshed out, making the bonds of brotherhood that they form over the course of the movie genuine and moving.The tale is familiar, archetypal even, but it does a couple things to set itself apart. The first is the deep south setting. It's grimy, lived-in, and unique, and is host to a whole cast of new supporting characters, each more memorable than the last. The other is Zak's Down Syndrome, which is not a portrayal by an actor, but something his actor actually has. I thought the portrayal of it was excellent. It is not played for laughs, which would be horrible, but neither is it a tool that the film manipulates us with to earn our sympathy. Zak is a funny, endearing character simply because that's who he is, and the moments in which he is told and treated like he is a real person - rather than the awful things people have said to him his whole life - are some of the most affecting in the whole film.In short, ""The Peanut Butter Falcon"" is an excellent film of a touching human story. It blends its humor and heart mostly seamlessly, creating a moving, genuine film that was one of my favorite cinema experiences this year.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

It has interesting characters, a great buddy/adventure story, great locations and great music. Not to mention excellent pacing that contributes to a concise run time. Way too many movies overrun these days, and I can see it does annoy people in the cinema. Remember when movies just used to END in the 60's and 70's? The snappy ending of Easy Rider comes to mind, but I've gone off on a tangent here.

244,OwensDad1,Greatly Exceeds Expectations,9,14 August 2020,"Excellent film. Zack Gottsagen (Zak) is such a wonderful surprise. He more then held his own with the rest of the cast. Making his acting debut, he's going toe to toe with the likes of Bruce Dern, Thomas Hayden Church and the rest of this cast. Each and every performance from the cast, leads and supporting, felt incredibly authentic. Dakota Johnson (Eleanor) has never impressed me. Other than her DNA, I could never understand the reason for her success. Johnson is great here. Authentic, real and in just the right amount. The story is mainly focused on Zak and Tyler (Shia LaBeouf), and that's when the movie shines brightest. It's a road trip story that focuses on character development and relationships. And the relationship these two characters create is the heart & soul of this story. The growth both characters experience is exceptional. Both actors work well together and have fantastic chemistry. LaBeouf is great here. He carries the film and shows the charisma, range and talent that make him an A list talent. Unfortunately his personal demons have prevented him from achieving that level of success and recognition. He shows, once again, that he may be the best actor of his age. 9 out of 10",The Peanut Butter Falcon

262,furqan-00774,A heartwarming tale making you smile,8,6 September 2020,"This movie is one of the sweetest movies I have seen in a while. It is a feel good movie which should not be missed. The plot is set in North Carolina and follows a young man named Zak (Zack Gottsagen) with Down Syndrome who escapes from an assisted living facility. He then meets a wiful fisherman named Tyler (Shia Labeouf) on the run and an unusual companionship begins. A well meaning social worker Eleanor (Dakota Johnson) attempts to track Zak down and get him back to the living facility. The problem with Eleanor is that although she cares for Zak but she too underestimates him like everyone else. Tyler seems to see the potential in Zak and tries to fulfill his wish even though he has problems of his own. The movie does not want us to feel too sympathetic towards Zak, it just wants to paint a picture of a small guy with a big heart. Zak like everyone else has dreams, things to pursue, this is what he wants Eleanor and others to understand. At the same time, Tyler should stop running and try to face his problems. One of the best things about the movie which I loved is the bold casting. Along with wonderful actors such as Shia Labeouf and Dakota Johnson, they cast Zack Gottsagen who himself is suffering from Down Syndrome. The work behind the camera by Nigel bluck is amazing. The writing and direction by Tyler Nielsen and Michale Schwartz is top notch. This movie is an emotional ride with stirring conversations, motivating scenes, exceptional acting and a heartwarming tale which will make you smile.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

Of course he doesn't hold a candle to Zack, the true star of the film. What an amazing talent, that we are so lucky to see blossom on the screen. What a sweet and beautiful performance - not sure I've rooted this much for a character in a lonnng time. I won't spoil anything, but a scene of his at the end had me literally cheering.

Especially Elanore, who seems to stick out like a sore thumb on screen as a miscast and a character that could have been handled differently. Overall the scenery and ""Georgia"" makes it a worthy watch and Mr PBF wasn't too bad as well. Good for one watch but that's pretty much about it. Goodluck Shia, you're awesome!",The Peanut Butter Falcon

280,lilledianao,Heartwarming and eye opening!,9,15 March 2021,"This movie opened my eyes a GREAT deal with people with Downs. I would definitely treat a disabled person like the character of Dakota Johnson and it was so great to highlight the fact that disabled people are just only a little less capable than the rest of us. The cast was AMAZING!! I especially love LeBouf's performance he is an Oscarworthy actor with a bad rep. I was unsure of Dakota because of the Fifty Shades franchise but she completely knocked it out of the park. As did Zack and the rest of the cast. I do not rate this movie 9/10 because it is about a disabled person, it is a 9/10 because it tells a beautiful heartwarming story of family, loss and finding yourself along with excellent acting, directing, costumes etc etc.! VERY MUCH worth a watch in my opinions. It does have some flaws but not enough to lose more than one star. Great job. I would love a sequel just because the cast had amazing chemistry and I would watch any movie with them anytime. Very good quality movie!",The Peanut Butter Falcon

289,Polarbear53041,The family you choose,10,14 April 2020,"I'm glad I didn't see this when it came out. I would have enjoyed it, but not nearly as much. I watched it alone but clearly this is one to enjoy with family, and whether its family we choose or family we end up with, it's made pretty clear there's often little difference.Now. As someone who never much liked him, whatever it is Mr. Labeouf is doing lately is working. So much so in fact, he's quickly becoming one of my favorite actors. This performance (along with Honey Boy) are absolutely good enough to generate Oscar ""buzz"". In fact, this movie deserves recognition for multiple categories, but for those who could care less about shiny statues from ""the academy""? Its simply a great movie. Its funny. It's emotional. Its interesting. It's all these things, and it was done right. Its no secret how delicate of a challenge a character like Zak can be (see RDJ in Tropic Thunder for explanation) and intentional or not, far too many movies come off as exploitative when approaching a condition like Down Syndrome. I won't pretend to know what it takes to perfectly handle that kind of challenge, all i know is I saw Zak as just one thing, an interesting character.As far as criticisms, a couple things do come to mind, but really nothing major. A few parts are a little cheesy, but it's a family type film so it's kinda expected. Like two people traveling on foot through rough terrain and somehow making it look easy, maybe too easy? Or the classic coincidence when two people ""from totally different worlds"" are thrown together and are about the same age, one's male, other female, both incredibly good looking? Amazing odds!Look, it's a damn good movie and these are unsettling times. For the people stuck inside, trying to agree on what to watch together? This one. Watch this one.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

I was glued from beginning to end. Tugged at my heartstrings and left me feeling warm and fuzzy inside. Everyone NEEDS to watch this once in their life!

307,alanlenihan,Brings a true sense of warmth,8,11 February 2020,"This film embodied warmth to me. It brings a tale of three people who all share a commonality of loss and grief, Zak (through his family), Tyler (through his brother) and Eleanor (through her husband), and through Zak they find each other a real and beautiful sense of discovery.Although some may say the film was predictable and cliche of 'opposites attract' I would say that it did so uniquely. There were moments of heart thumping anxiety and fear, and moments of pure joy and happiness. Overall the film creates a real sense of journey.Shia LaBeouf in my opinion is one of the most underrated talents in the industry and under the correct guidance could give us oscar performance after oscar performance. He gives his all in every performance with pure emotion and passion, when he smiles you smile, when he cries you cry. That is feat not easily done and for that reason I hope to see him in many more films.Zack Gottsagen deserves the merit for what he's achieved and the issues he raised within this film. He showed real pride and power about his identity and without fail brought a very relevant issue in seeing disability discrimination and seeing these people as the 'other'. He is a brave and intelligent MAN and actor, and he has my utmost respect as a professional in his industry and as a human being.The ending will leave you on edge, it will make you cry and it will make you happy, a film deserved of accolades and a truly brilliant watch.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

THAT movies make you think..Outstanding performance by Shia LaBeouf and Zack Gottsagen. The Big brother and family theme worked well because of these two!Also Wanted to mention, that Shia made a real comeback in this movie and I hope he will do more projects like this!!!Everyone should watch this movie! (Especially if you are tired of modern cinema ))",The Peanut Butter Falcon
311,d0ugdimmadome,Wholesome heartwarming entertainment,8,10 December 2019,"This film has officially reinstated my trust in Shia LaBeouf as a reliable, strong performer ahead of the release of his new film ""Honey Boy"".This film takes us on a journey with Tyler (LaBeouf), a mechanic on the run after setting fire to the docks owned by Duncan (Hawkes), and with Zak (Gottsagen), a 22 year old down syndrome boy also on the run, chasing his dreams of becoming a professional wrestler and following in the footsteps of his idol ""The Salt Water Redneck"" (Haydn-Church). The pair soon find themselves crossing paths and, after a brief adjustment period on Tyler's part, become inseparable, as they run from their pasts in seek of a brighter future.The chemistry between Zak and Tyler is perfect, with each actor giving fully realised and believable performances in their very different respective roles. Thanks greatly to the strong screenplay and incredible performances given, the audience has no trouble whatsoever in rooting for the strange pairing across the hour and a half runtime. With each step they take away from their past lives we get to know more about the two men, their blossoming relationship and their subtle nuances, with the film succeeding in allowing the audience to be a part of their strange, beautiful journey.The film maintains a beautiful balance of drama and comedy throughout, with some moments leading me to literally laugh out loud (mainly moments of Tyler and Zak just harmfully goofing around), with others leading me to lean forward in suspense and panic. After the film ended, I felt such a genuine connection to both LaBeouf and Gottsagen's characters, which in itself speaks volumes of their very human portrayals of characters in the film.Oh and this film made me realise the sheer talent of Shia LaBeouf in this post Michael Bay Transformers era. I've still not seen many of his other critically acclaimed works such as ""Fury"", however, so maybe I'm a little late to hop on the LaBeouf bandwagon. Even so, I can't wait to see more great work from the actor, especially his upcoming performance and screenplay in Honey Boy.To conclude, this film is tense, hilarious and beyond heartwarming. Like a modern ""Stand By Me"", maybe. Come for the outlandish premise, but stay for the exceptional and oftentimes surprising character study of Tyler and Zak.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

316,anutopianist,Arguably Weird Film Title with a Cute but Unrealistically Hasty Storyline,3,14 November 2019,"Sorry to say this, but this is a predictable product created by predictable millennials. English has become excessively simplified in films like this to the point where I will not be surprised if there is an increasing decline in literary geniuses in the entertainment industry who can be as competitive as William Shakespeare, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, Stephen King, J.K. Rowling, and so forth. Besides that, The Peanut Butter Falcon is an arguably weird title, so it made me concerned about whether its storyline was going to be good or not good. Only a person who can deactivate their logical skill can be able to believe in this film's storyline that cheapens the characters' potential to make a great film. All in all, this film has a FanFic quality about it in some ways.",The Peanut Butter Falcon
317,Timtacular,"I never, NEVER rate movies. This movie DEMANDS IT!",10,6 November 2019,"I didn't know what to expect from this movie, just knew that Shia has a good nose for scripts and the acting chops to fill any pair of boots asked of him.This movie is overflowing with heart, with raw emotion and is an amazing study of interpersonal relationships that, for 99.9% of the time would never have a chance to exist.All three of the main actors are stunningly real in their roles, they embrace the deep emotions that are so hard to show in film without coming off as contrived or cheesy and yet they do so effortlessly and convincingly.But above all, this movie is INSANELY FUNNY. You might have gotten divorced in the morning, your dog was run over in the afternoon, but go see this movie in the evening and no matter how hard you try. You won't be able to stop yourself from CACKLING out loud.This is a once in a generation movie, I guarantee you've never seen anything like it.Do yourself a favor and see this movie with as many people as you can convince to come with you.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

Dakota is a sight for sore eyes, her presence on the screen always brightens up the scene. She is so beautiful and such a talented actress. Womderful performances by everyone.

I had to turn it off after 27 minutes of gratuitous cursing. At first I thought the curse words were not too frequent and were - sort of - ""necessary"" to the story.

I hope he has a bright future in acting for future roles. Thomas Haden Church and Bruce Dern were great veteran actors whom added amazing performances throughout the film at needed times. Jon Berthnal was a great choice for a big brother for Shia. Jake the Snake was a cool cameo performance. Writing was brilliant and direction of the characters and storyline...great film all around! Worth your time to enjoy and a great pallet cleanse from movies that are consumed with violence, gruetious sex scenes, and uncompelling storylines.

There is no dramatic tension whatsoever because the way almost every situation is handled is unrealistic, and the stakes are pretty low. I was never worried that anyone would be hurt or killed, because this is basically a Hallmark movie that stays very safe and predictable throughout. I was also never super invested in the protagonist achieving his goal, because the goal itself wasn't particularly impressive or hard to do, even for someone with a disability.

It's NOT just a movie stereotyping down syndrome wrestling fans.
I imagine the writer knows someone like this and understands their obsession and desire for some freedom.
People with disabilities need to be allowed to have fun & make mistakes & learn from them just like everyone.

""yes, let's do it""

It's cute and I'd recommend it. Only thing that marred it slightly was it did lack a bit of depth to the storyline, which was quite typical cookie cutter ""outdoor journey"" style.

Direction: 9
Screenplay: 9
Acting: 10
Story: 9Though it may not be the first thing most critics mention, The Peanut Butter Falcon is a visually beautiful movie. The mise en scène of broad marshes, lush fields, and rushing rivers seems perfectly balanced with the small-cast intimacy of the story.And what a story! A hero's journey, complete with a lovable and fearless hero Zak (Zack Gottsagen), anti-hero sidekick Tyler (Shia LaBeouf), and beautiful love interest Eleanor (Dakota Johnson). Gottsagen and LeBeouf in particular were written and portrayed with depth and nuance. Johnson's portrayal is skillful, but unfortunately the Eleanor character is less filled-out. Worse, it's not clear that if Eleanor were removed from the script altogether that the story would have proceeded any differently. This is a buddy film: girls are motivators but not agents of the action.But I'm getting ahead of myself. The story (think ""Huckleberry Finn"" meets ""Rain Man"") is rich and captivating -- and yes, I'll say it, magical. Gottsagen and LaBeouf's interactions ring true, and continue to resonate throughout. The challenges they face include bad guys, sure; but the real obstacles to the protagonists reaching their goal are internal: Zak's Down Syndrome and Tyler's penchant for bad choices.The writing is tremendous overall. The humor always hits the mark, the dialog is natural, and the exposition -- a critical yet too-often clumsy element -- is nearly always handled smoothly. There is plenty of exciting action throughout. However, the ending (don't worry, I won't spoil anything) seems rushed and under-written. Writer/directors Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz famously struggled to finance the film's creation (Nilson lived in a tent for at least some of this period), and I'm left wondering if perhaps the money ran dry before the ending could be fully fleshed out.Even that flaw, however, failed to leave a scratch on the wonder and joy I felt at the close.Finally, a few words of praise (and one reservation) for how the filmmakers portray individuals with Down Syndrome. As background, my brother has Down Syndrome, though he is not nearly as high-functioning as Zak.Let's get my single qualm out of the way first. Zak is portrayed as being unusually strong (not critical to the plot, but more than a passing reference). The super-strong-yet-developmentally-disabled caricature has been a bogeyman of fiction for longer than any of us have been alive (the golem of Yiddish literature; the monster in the 1931 film, Frankenstein; the Incredible Hulk of comics, TV, and movies). Perhaps the writers were trying to take the hex off of that device by assigning it to the hero; in the end, though, I think the community would be better served by leaving the golem trope behind altogether.That said, the character that emerges over the course of the film -- Zak's choices, priorities, and dialog -- could only be the product of a collaboration between actor and writer/directors with a keen and intimate emotional connection to their subject. In each of a thousand discreet moments, Zak's gestures, sense of humor, and goals and desires sparkle with authenticity. Not once did Zak utter a word that I couldn't have imagined my coming out of my brother's mouth. I'd bet, if you asked them, that Gottsagen's family feels the same.In the end, it's precisely that veracity that gives the film its heart, and makes it more than just another fun-but-mindless buddy adventure. The Peanut Butter Falcon is an engrossing journey from which you never want to depart.(As of this writing, TPBF is streaming on Amazon Prime at no charge to subscribers.)",The Peanut Butter Falcon

353,cjshadow2020,A simple film with a huge heart,10,23 September 2020,"I wasn't sure what this film was going into it, which is pretty rare for me nowadays. The story is pretty simple, a man with down-syndrome escapes his home at a senior care facility and embarks on a quest to become a wrestler like he sees on TV.While the story has some pretty basic plot points a lot of films have, the quality of the execution of those beats is what elevates this film to a higher level. The acting is also pretty good. Shia LaBeouf is fun, Dakota Johnson is quite the surprise (I imagine her role in the Fifty Shades series turns a lot of people off), and the star, Zack Gottsagen feels incredibly genuine. Everything about this film was made with heart, soul, and love. I could tell this is a project that everyone involved cared deeply about, and it shows in the final product.I also feel that the messages this film portrays are all positive, which round off a film that can be enjoyed by almost anyone.I will say there is one scene at the ""climax"" of the film that doesn't really make sense when compared to the rest of the film, but it hardly takes away from the experience.Overall, I urge anyone looking into this film to watch it, its a wholesome film that is truly special in an age of money-printing schlock.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

Shia LeBeouff probably needed a truss after carrying every other actor in the flick except for Thomas Haden Church.

Good cinematography and the actors had good chemistry. Unfortunately, the ending was more than cringeworthy, it was insulting. The only real ""special effect"" was done better in the 70's, the shameless and unexplainable ""plot twist"" for Shia LaBeouf's character was completely unnecessary, and Dakota Johnson's decisions throughout the entire film (but easy to ignore because, hey, it's a movie) became so ludicrous at the end it made her appear mentally ill. Without a complete rewrite of the ending (and hiring a freshman computer graphics student to do the special effect), it would have been better to just cut things off right before the match and leave the actual ending to the imagination of the audience.

It seemed to be more realistic and at the same time its mythical elements also rang true. The PBF was a more feel good film, and may be a good choice as well if you have friends or family with Downs.

Every aspect of it I was in awe and when I say every aspect I mean every facet of movie making. The dynamic of Zack Gottsagen and Shia LaBeouf was just incredible. This has to be the best performance Shia has done and his timing and every little nuance in this movie was just impeccable. I can't think of a movie where somebody took these brief little pauses and moments to let the dialog breathe which blew me away. Thanks so much to the writers for being inspired by Zack which gave it such great heart and spirit and made this one of the most special movies with a phenomenal muse.

On one hand, I found themes of redemption and coping, and on the other hand I found important lessons in confidence and determination.It isn't a big-budget film full of special effects, but it tells a down-to-earth story of how two mens' journey together changes them both for the better. It's as simple as that, BUT the magic of this movie lies in the dialogue and well-timed humor. The best way I can describe it is like...a modern day ""Huckleberry Finn.""I won't say this movie is for everyone, but I can confidently say it's a film that many who are in the throes of soul-searching and purpose-seeking will find important as well as entertaining.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

Very little effort has been put into the characters and though the moral of the story here is that mentally challenged people seek an ordinary life just like anyone else, the sugarcoated plot only makes me feel the opposite.The movie is pretty much a simpler and poorer version of the Green Book, Tyler the bad boy and Zak who suffers from Down Syndrome and thus has been kept imprisoned in a foster home because of his disability, try to find a new life in Florida free of their past. They go through some adventure and then both find a happy ending and fin, that's it. Throughout the movie there's also flashbacks to Tyler's brother in a rather desperate attempt to flesh out his character and just shows this seems to me like it was directed by someone who has little experience and imagination in the movie industry.Anyways, like mentioned at the start already, lack of character depth was my biggest issue and though i like that the movie tried to give some representation to those who'd usually wouldn't land big roles, it would've had a bigger impact had it not been so simplistic and uninspiring.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

409,nvanshikha,What's Rule#1? Party!!,9,14 May 2020,"Peanut Butter Falcon captures the true essence of how down's syndrome can add more to one's life and the people around them than it can take. Being a sibling of an elder brother with down's, I am apprehensive of mainstream movies dealings with the theme of disability. But Peanut Butter Falcon hit home like none other. The ease with which Zack Gottsagen flowed through the movie was like a day out of my life that I shared with my brother until he passed away. The movie sustained the innocence of the psyche of a person with down's, while at the same time poignantly advocating for the sense of agency that a person with disability must have about his life, which we often take away from them in the name of being their guardians.
Kudos to Zack for giving all those who view the movie that one nugget of a life advice that the best of spiritual gurus can't get across. What's rule number 1 of the game? It is Party!!",The Peanut Butter Falcon

411,InKCraft_Harris,A perfect treatment of the human spirit,8,6 April 2020,"There are a number of really thought provoking movies out there that show the authenticity of human nature. But very few that leave you with a warm heart.Peanut Butter Falcon is a surprising feel-good movie that follows an unlikely friendship formed between a down and out guy running from his bad decisions (Tyler, played by my favorite authentic actor, Shia LaBeouf), and a guy with down syndrome (Zak played brilliantly by Zack Gottsagent) who has recently ""escaped"" from his adult home, a place that treats him kindly, but offers little in the way of nurturing his need to become a famous pro wrestler.So typical in movies like these, you expect a great deal of degrading and poking fun at the expense of trying to relate to how ""most human behavior"" is. But this movie rises above and will surprise you more than once with how honest and endearing Tyler's relationship to Zak becomes. One could only hope to have a champion in your own corner who would encourage you to live life with all its warts and failures, the way Tyler does for Zak.
The ending will move you and leave you satisfied. Please Hollywood, make more movies like this!",The Peanut Butter Falcon

416,nellywalas,Neurodivergence,10,21 July 2021,"The plot of this film was absolutely fantastic! The director of this film absolutely nailed the presence of ableism in todays world. The sad tale of a neurodivergent boy being tossed aside by the world who takes his own future into his own hands and goes forth by seeing his all time childhood idol in a different state. The way this film tackled the ableist slur was absolutely amazing and the cast themselves clashed so well together in this. Zak and Tyler are platonic soulmates and i love it. I had high hopes for this film and i'm glad it didn't go underestimated. Overall loved this film, definitely one of my comfort movies i could rewatch often.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

422,bluerumorproductions,Easily One of the Best Films I've Seen in the Last Six Years,10,1 January 2020,"I haven't seen a lot of great films over the past half decade. I'm a little bit of a film snob, too. So, that. I freaking love this movie. The chemistry between the leads is just electric. This is, at it's heart, a buddy movie and I don't say that dismissively. Zak and Tyler burn up the screen and LaBeouf is giving one of the most effortless performances of the last half decade. I loved the story, the progression, the diligent respect of an actual character arch, which is hopelessly missing these days. People will nit pick this movie as they do, especially when LaBeouf is present for some reason, but it is a great film. Maybe not perfect, but totally great. I really love seeing films where people are just, well, people, struggling upwards in a need to keep going and find meaning. It's the existentialist in me. This one ends on a higher note and I liked that as well. There are mean people in this film. There are mean people in life. Fact. Very well done.",The Peanut Butter Falcon
423,dinospino17,I was blown away,9,15 August 2019,"I'm just gonna lay it all out right now. I absolutely loved this movie. From start to finish I was smiling, laughing, crying, and as the credits rolled, I looked over at my friend who was with me, and all we could just say was ""wow."" I can't even begin to put in to words just how much I loved it.
The Peanut Butter Falcon revolves around a young boy named Zak, who has down syndrome, and how he follows his dream of becoming a professional wrestler. Along the way he meets Tyler, and together they form an unbreakable bond with one another, and go on the journey of a lifetime together.
The writing is all around, really good, and as of now, this is my main contender for best screenplay at the Oscars next year.
But what blew me away most about the film is the performances. I honestly had to remind myself at one point that these two men are actors, because their performances just feel so real. Shia Labeouf gives without a doubt the best performance of his career here, and it will for sure garner him a comeback in Hollywood. But the standout was definitely newcomer Zack Gottsagen. Being one of the few actors out there who actually has down syndrome, he plays his part flawlessly. And yes, I know some of you will say that he has a bit of an advantage, but trust me when I say that he is gonna go so far with his career after this. I really hope he gets the recognition he deserves.
My only real issue is that there is a subplot in the film that I really didn't feel was necessary. It didn't really add anything, and it's only purpose was to give the story some sort of villain, which it really didn't need in the first place.
But all in all, this is an amazing movie. There really hasn't been anything like it, and it deserves to be seen by everyone. It is funny, it is heartwarming, it is so purely and genuinely human, and it is one of my favorite movies of 2019. I give The Peanut Butter Falcon a 9.5/10",The Peanut Butter Falcon

426,NolanChaloupka_OnceUponAMoviePod,A sweet film!,7,28 August 2019,"We finally got The Peanut Butter Falcon playing in my town so naturally I was first in line to see it. After hearing all the hype from this film it's safe to say I was ecstatic to see it. After the film ended I had a great time, but I felt it was a bit overhyped.First of all the pros of this film, Shia LeBeouff and Dakota Johnson give a great performance with a fun story that kept a smile on my face throughout the film. I also felt the film looked fantastic. The cinematography was gritty, real and did a great job of capturing the swampy area of the North Carolina Outer Banks.As for cons I felt that there were some scenes that didn't really work for me. They seemed a little pretentious or out of left field. And I don't know if I really buy the ending of the film. It seemed a little far fetched for my tastes.However, I love this film. Looking at it from a critics standpoint it has some issues, but looking at it from a movie viewer it's a great time! I plan to watch this again as soon as it comes out. If this film is playing in your town go check it out!",The Peanut Butter Falcon

We saw a menacing alligator. Then there was lots of swimming without any mention or thought about the hazard. There was a pile of wire crab traps with a tarp over them that was supposedly destroyed by fire. Their trip took several days but the only food available was a jar of peanut butter and a hand caught fish.

430,zackerman24,"A sweet, funny, and heart-warming movie that knows exactly what it wants to be",9,17 September 2020,"Within the first 5-10 minutes, you will know exactly whether this is a movie for you or not. The opening scene perfectly encapsulates the fun and heart-warming tone of the whole film. The movie centers around Zak, a young man with Down's Syndrome, whose dream is to attend a wrestling camp in North Carolina with his favorite wrestler - he escapes from his home and ends up crossing paths with Shia LaBeouf's on-the-run character, Tyler. Tyler decides to look out for him along the way and a sweet journey ensues, meanwhile Tyler is being chased for his past actions and Zak is being chased by the kind woman who oversaw the home he escaped from.PBF's success is in its direction and cast. The pacing of the movie never stalls, and the tone is balanced nicely - while it handles some serious elements, there's an overarching comfort to it, akin to a bedtime story. Though that may not be everyone's cup of tea, this movie is downright enjoyable; the mix of humor, relationships, tragedy, and local culture is so well crafted.With the cast, there is a sense that all the main roles were cast perfectly. It also doesn't hurt that the filmmakers met Zak in real life at a summer camp and decided to write the movie around him. But regardless, the rapport between Zak and Shia is what really elevates the movie - humor is so often about timing and these two seem to have really figured it out.While this movie pulls out some of the usual cliches and tropes, its impact is undeniable. And frankly, if the filmmakers at least execute on those tropes well, does it even matter? The movie radiates the enjoyment of a group of people knowing exactly what type of movie they wanted to make and following through on it excellently. The lighter tone of the movie is also what allows for some of those cliches to be more easily accepted by the audience. Though some may find my rating high, for me, this movie is a bright spot among a sea of bland movies with familiar/repetitive characters and storylines. And to make a film about a character with Down's Syndrome that is so much more than just about a character with Down's Syndrome is an honorable feat.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

The connection between the main characters played by LeBauf and Gottsagen seem sincere, like they would get along off-camera aswell.However, the story seems rushed, and the characters don't really develop throughout the movie. We see some backstory, but it's mostly a filler, and the good guys are good, the bad guys are bad.The message is good, and its load and clear: people with Downs Syndrom are just people, like everyone else.

Felt longer than it actually was but not boring by any means. A little surprised given that the movie had two ""f"" bombs but was given a PG-13 rating (not a big deal to me but my mom joined me and wasn't too thrilled with the language).

""The Peanut Butter Falcon"", from the producers of ""Little Miss Sunshine"", this funny & fun & heartwarming story is a gem from start to finish. It's been some time since I found a story so endearing. It's about a young man with Down's Syndrome & his quest to meet his professional wrestler hero. Along the way he meets a roughneck-on-the-run (played EXCEPTIONALLY well by Shia Labeouf) who reluctantly finds redemption through his not-quite-welcome traveling companion. Still not in wide release but, with THREE previous Oscar nominees (John Hawkes, Thomas Haden Church, Bruce Dern), I have a strong suspicion this tale of sincere human bonding will gain momentum in the current era of comic book superheroes & find its way to a theater near you soon...and well worth a drive, if not.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

It's at decent film, nothing special as you can see here many on german public TV, don't need Amazon prime for. The movie appears to me (German background) like some TomSawyer HackleberryFinn spin off utilizing some disabled to achieve empathy which fails and revives Shias failed career (which destroyed many of my anticipated sequels to beloved past movies like Indy4, Wallstreet2 etc.) I had to turn off after 1h.
Too all those who believe this is >=7 I would recommend to check out the 2011 French made drama-comedy 'The Intouchables' with Omar Sy which depicts a disabled in a realistic way as expressed from many of them to the director. Unfortunately there seems to be no or bad English dubbing for that movie (contrary to German which world's no #1 in dubbing and reason that movie high success apart from France).

If you're not convinced yet though this movie is really sweet man... this movie is like staring into Dakota Johnson's eyes type sweet.

It helps me to slow down and think of the simple things in life and I found it in this movie. So many things to be grateful for just by watching this movie. I do not regret watching this movie. It might be simple and plain for a lot of people but not to me. This movie says a lot of things on what we are today as a human being and the choices we make on where we are heading in our lives. We're only given two choices in our precious, short and fleeting life either just to be living or to be alive. This movie gives us that. This movie is like an introspection and ephiphany to one's own life and it certainly is to mine. This movie hits close home to me because in some ways I can relate to the situation of Tyler and Zak- lost, broken and an outcast trying to find their way and a place of this world and they found each other and became a family. This quote that I wrote 11 years ago when I was in that situation says a lot about this movie,""There are family that treats you like a total stranger and there are total strangers that treats you like a real family.""",The Peanut Butter Falcon

499,dallasoutsider83,TPBF Soars Above Expectations,9,26 August 2019,"Writing and directing your first full length feature film can seem like a daunting task and weighs heavier on the likelihood of failure over success. However, Tyler Nilson and Michael Schwartz prove that, every now and then, the newcomers come out swinging and knock it out of the park. That's exactly what they did with The Peanut Butter Falcon.
The premise for the film is a young man with down syndrome (played by Zack Gottsagen) who has no family escapes from the nursing home that he is confined to in order to follow his dream to become the next great wrestling champion. Along the way he meets a man (played by Shia LaBeouf) on the run from thugs he has stolen and destroyed property from. The two form an incidental friendship that neither expected to obtain; as some are calling a modern-day Huck Finn flick.
Known only for shorts and documentary films, Nilson and Schwartz take their craft to the next level and provide the audience with an incredibly gorgeous film that entices laughter and smiles for ninety-three minutes.
Some key moments of creative genius come from the choices made in cinematography, for example the choice to shoot the actors from behind as Shia LaBeouf's character breaks his macho persona and cries into the arms of his new friend. You feel the emotional baggage that LaBeouf's character is holding, all without even looking at his face. Brilliantly crafted by the minds of Nilson and Schwartz, this shot proves the incredible acting ability of LaBeouf while defying a major rule in film and theatre: never have your back to the audience. It's a ""you have to see it to get it"" moment. Once you do, you'll understand. Another example would be aerial shots of the two men in different scenes striking a dichotomy between the characters pushing against each other and pulling each other closer.
Speaking of the actors, how Nilson and Schwartz were able to land all-stars such as LaBeouf and Dakota Johnson, who plays the social services worker assigned to Zach's case, is beyond understanding, but so pleasing. Putting these two on screen together is exactly what was needed to bring home the sincerity and honesty that is essential for the film's success. LaBeouf, who is usually the aggressive and dominant actor on screen, becomes softer and more reactive. He checks his ego at the door and allows himself to listen and react as opposed to making it the Shia Show. LaBeouf stated in an interview that he had a plan for his character and prepared extensively on which direction he was going to take him, however once he got in front of his co-star Zack and when they started rolling, all of that preparation went out the window. Shia stated he had to scrap HIS plan and replace it with reactive acting to make the performance genuine. This was a huge step for LaBeouf as an actor and one that I believe has launched him a notch higher on the ""excellent actor"" spectrum.
Another actor whose performance was thoroughly impressive was Dakota Johnson. Johnson plays the employee assigned to Zack's case and must go on a state-wide man hunt to try and find Zack and bring him back to the nursing home. Johnson, well known for her starring role as Anastasia Steele in the 50 Shades of Grey movies, is finally in the role she was born to play. Her snarky attitude plays wonderfully with LaBeouf as they banter back and forth as well as her warm, kindhearted feelings toward the boy she is responsible for. Indie films that focus on realism is where Johnson shines. Hopefully she sticks with this genre.
The brightest star on screen, however, is the lead Zack Gottsagen. It is so refreshing to have a character with a disability be played by a professional actor with the same disability. Representation matters. Gottsagen plays the character (by the same name) with such depth and nuance it's inspirational. It's no wonder why LaBeouf abandoned his original plan for his own character and just focused on following Gottsagen's lead. Gottsagen's ability to show character development for a character that could easily be played as flat due to his simplistic story line (he essentially just follows LaBeouf's character's lead the entire movie). Gottsagen's ability to lead while being led and show true fear, happiness, drunkenness, and love that is not only honest, but that resonates with the audience is truly astounding and worthy of a best actor nomination.
With first time writers/directors there are bound to be some bumps and low points. A rough CGI affect towards the end of the film and some line choices left me a little put off, but luckily those moments were overshadowed by the film's majority of brilliance. All in all, The Peanut Butter Falcon is the ""feel good movie of the year"" and is more than deserving of your time and ticket price.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

Highly recommend.",The Peanut Butter Falcon
501,nomercy1999,Amazing,10,24 August 2019,"As the father of a son with Down Syndrome I had high hopes and expectations for this movie. I watched all the interviews and reviews and was super excited to watch this. My wife and I went to watch it this morning, first showing and first people to purchase tickets from our local movie theatre. The movie starts and we were in awe of Zak and Tyler. They're chemistry was electric. You could tell Shia truly loved being beside and being with Gotteagen. This movie made my heart happy more than anything.
I understand the movie had to tackle the dreaded ""R"" word and it hurt hearing the word tossed out by a child at the beginning but Zaks response was legendary and I will never forget it!
It did a great job of shedding light on people with Down Syndrome and the struggles SOME go through. Unfortunately there are still people out there who don't know the joy of having a person with Down Syndrome can truly bring into they're lives.
All in all an amazing movie that makes perfect sense. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone who has any heart.
Hopefully this will become a series cause I would personally love to follow this story for as long as it can go on.",The Peanut Butter Falcon

515,tristanthomaswilliams,Magnificently Made and Moving,10,30 August 2019,"Shia LaBeouf's best performance of his career. His raw emotion and pure, heartfelt connections with Zach Gottsagen's and Dakota Johnson's characters propelled this film to a cinematic masterpiece. From start to finish, I had a smile across my face. Seeing Shia transform from a wannabe lone wolf to a true brother to Zach floored me. Dakota Johnson was a perfect contrast to their foolishness and wild nature, but as their journeys merged, her outgoing and daring side blossomed. There is not a bad thing I have to say about this film. The comedy and more specifically the comedic timing was impeccable, the cinematography was immersive and made me feel as if I was watching over the three find themselves and truly begin living their previously hardship-ridden lives. After viewing, my perspective on life and my attitude towards others had changed. The undertone of how society treats those that they feel are different and incapable was interwoven perfectly and handled with grace. An absolute gem and a must-see.

It made me laugh, and brought tears of joy to my eyes. It is brilliantly written; then the actors bring these words to life. People ask what it is about, but I don't think it really matters because it's not an action film per se; but in my opinion a lot more happens to see the growth of these characters from lost souls to finding their inner strength and beauty through the love of others. There are so many brilliant moments of human connection and undeniable humor in this film, you completely forget you're in a theater !
