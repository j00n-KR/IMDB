0,TheLittleSongbird,Challenging crash,6,17 April 2019,"David Cronenberg is for me one of the most interesting and unlike any other out there directors (even if not quite one of my personal favourites), despite being known for body horror and originating it his films are much more than that. They are incredibly well made, and as well as being unsettling some have a dark yet subtle wit or a poignant emotional core. All these are the reasons for my admiration and appreciation for him.Of all his films, 'Crash' (not to be confused with the film that, undeservedly in my opinion, won the Best Picture Oscar in its year, over the infinitely superior 'Brokeback Mountain', but that's another story) is his most controversial, causing a stir in Britain at the time. One can totally see why, with its uncompromising and difficult subject matter being portrayed unsettlingly and uniquely, something that fascinated and disturbed many yet sickened and perplexed just as many others. When it comes to me and my perception of 'Crash', it is a bit of a tricky one and not an easy film to rate and review. Do not consider it a misunderstood masterpiece or one of his best, at the same it's far from being on my worst films ever list and doesn't crash and burn. It's certainly an interesting and well made film, but other Cronenberg films connected with me far more emotionally and had me gripped more. Especially 'Dead Ringers' and 'The Fly'.Contrary to what those who hated 'Crash' say, those who say that there are no redeeming qualities whatsoever (personally can never say that about any lesser Cronenberg), there is a lot to admire. As with all Cronenberg films, 'Crash' looks great, with photography that is both beautiful, almost dream-like in places, and harrowing, when at its most harrowing it really hits hard. Absolutely loved the opening credits sequence, Cronenberg always delivers in this aspect. A lot of effort clearly went into the design of it visually, it is beautiful to watch while also being very creepy. Howard Shore's score does add quite a bit, it is truly haunting stuff that also brings shivers down the spine when necessary. Cronenberg's style is unmistakable, if more purposefully clinical than usual.He does admirably adhere close to the detached nature of the source material, which accounts for why viewers were and still are left cold and why his direction is more clinical. What is most interesting about the film and why it is controversial is its depiction of sex and violence, there is a lot of both, very daring and shocking at the time (still is) and both had seldom been depicted in this way before. The violence is uncompromising and does churn the stomach, even those who have seen a lot of violent films (myself included) will find themselves deeply disturbed. The sex scenes are beautifully choreographed and filmed while also being a mix of explicit, sensual, strange and ominous. When they merge, the depiction is vividly graphic, and for quite a large number it was/is hard to take, to me it was harrowing but in a way it intrigued. The film also made me think. Despite never getting to know the characters (Vaughan is the most interesting) or care for them, that doesn't stop Cronenberg from drawing great performances from a gifted cast. Found the standouts to be Elias Koteas, quite frightening here, and Deborah Kara Unger, who is equally astonishing.On the other hand, it is very easy to see why anybody would say 'Crash' is a challenging film and hard to like. While appreciating what it set out and tried to do, the emotional investment wasn't there for me, things that were there in 'Dead Ringers' and 'The Fly', and there were times where the intentional coldness was overdone. Likewise with the bizarre factor, especially later on where things increasingly stop making sense until an ending that leaves one dumbfounded-ly scratching their heads.While some of 'Crash' was thought-provoking, it was not always easy understanding what the point of it was and what it was trying to say. It also became repetitive with the sexual acts and violence becoming more frequent and in some cases not necessary, some of the film was pretty uneventful dramatically, the pace was very sluggish and the film could have been 20-25 minutes shorter because there was not enough plot, which was fairly slight structurally to begin with, to sustain the film's length.In summary, didn't bowl me over and the controversy is more than understandable, but do highly appreciate the effort and can't be too hard on it. 6/10",Crash
1,SnoopyStyle,"voyeuristic, fascinating, original and also a bit slow",7,12 December 2014,"Catherine Ballard (Deborah Kara Unger) is hypersexual. She and her husband James Ballard (James Spader) have an unconventional marriage. James causes a car crash when he moves into oncoming traffic. Helen Remington (Holly Hunter) is in the other car. Her husband is killed and she finds sexual enjoyment in the crash. James and Helen find compatible erotic needs with car crashes. Vaughan (Elias Koteas) is a like-minded person and introduces them to his group with Gabrielle (Rosanna Arquette) who walks with leg braces.Director David Cronenberg is diving into some sexual perversities here. It is voyeuristic at times, fascinating, different, but also prodding at other times. Sex is not hot as much as it is disturbingly cold. It is definitely weird. I do wonder if there is more to this movie. It's a crazy artifact of cinema.",Crash
2,claudio_carvalho,One of the Sickest and Weirdest Movies Ever,4,30 November 2010,"The producer James Ballard (James Spader) and his sexy wife Catherine Ballard (Deborah Kara Unger) have an open relationship with fantasies and extra conjugal affairs that they tell to each other to increase their sexual drive. When James has a car accident where the other driver dies, he changes his behavior and becomes obsessed for car-crash victims. The lame James befriends the widow of his victim, Helen Remington (Holly Hunter), and the sick maniac for accidents Vaughan (Elias Koteas) and he joins a world of people that feels pleasure watching and provoking car accidents, dragging Catherine with him. ""Crash"" is one of the sickest and weirdest movies I have ever seen. In the 90's, when I saw it for the first time on VHS, I liked it more than now. I have just watched again on a high-quality DVD and I found this time a pointless erotic story with an unbelievable plot that has the only intention of shocking. There is no message, no nothing but sick people having kinky sex related to car crashes. Deborah Kara Unger is extremely sexy and hot in one of her first works and the choreography of the accidents is quite perfect. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Crash – Estranhos Prazeres"" (""Crash – Weird Pleasures"")",Crash
3,gavin6942,"One of Cronenberg's More Bizarre Works, Which Says a Lot",8,28 July 2011,"After getting into a serious car accident, a TV director (James Spader) discovers an underground sub-culture of scarred, omnisexual car-crash victims who use car accidents and the raw sexual energy they produce to try to rejuvenate his sex life with his wife.This film is a great director (David Cronenberg) adapting a great novelist (JG Ballard), and featuring a great cast. James Spader has rarely been so good as he is here, and for those who cannot get enough of him having sex, this is the film you want (I honestly lost count). Holly Hunter is also great... with the star being, I think, Elias Koteas.Koteas, who does not get enough credit, despite being in many, many great films, is obsessed with car accidents and likes to recreate historic ones, such as the crash that killed James Dean. No pads, no air bags, just metal on metal -- with him inside. He plays the character Vaughn in such a way that his perversity seems normal, even believable.",Crash
4,lee_eisenberg,Not too much of a far cry from the movie that just won Best Picture.,6,15 March 2006,"The ""Crash"" that just won Best Picture last week made some people forget that there was also this ""Crash"", about some Torontonians who like to get in car wrecks. I should identify that David Cronenberg directed this, just so that you know beforehand that there are some pretty gruesome scenes. Some people are likely to find this movie really gross (and some scenes do make your skin crawl), but it's interesting if nothing else. James Spader leads the cast as filmmaker James Ballard, who slowly but surely becomes infatuated with crashes and drags everyone along with him. Also starring Holly Hunter, Elias Koteas, and Deborah Kara Unger.It's hard to believe that this was written by J.G. Ballard, who also wrote ""Empire of the Sun"".",Crash
5,jboothmillard,Crash,3,26 September 2005,"From director David Cronenberg (Videodrome, The Fly) comes one of the most disturbing and most obviously banned films I have ever seen, and I thought The Evil Dead was bad. I'll agree with the critics about this film being original and possibly five stars, but in my opinion I did not like the film that much because it was too controversial. Starring James Spader as James Ballard and The Piano's Holly Hunter as Helen Remington, basically these two people are involved in a serious car crash. When they meet they pretty much immediately have sex, even with their injuries. I think the biggest shock is not just having sex after a crash, but taking pictures of one for fun and being turned on by the description of people dying, e.g. mention of blood. Sick, but interesting and original in one of two places. It won the Cannes Film Festival Award for Jury Special Prize, and it was nominated for the Golden Palm. It was number 64 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments. Adequate, in my opinion!",Crash
6,ccthemovieman-1,This Is About As Low At It Goes,1,18 December 2006,"This is so bad that even the ultra-Liberal film critics saw nothing of ""redeeming social value"" in this mess about weirdos who get their jollies out of car crashes.The first part of this film is nothing but soft porn. Later, it returns to that periodically and even includes gay-lesbian scenes. These actors are so sleazy themselves in most of the roles they have played n screen that it was no surprise to me they all got together for this horrendous bomb of a movie. I'm speaking of people like James Spader, Holly Hunter, Elias Koteas, Rosanna Arquette, etc.This story is insultingly stupid but if you are looking for a demo to prove how morally bankrupt Hollywood can get, just how low it can go, this is a good one to offer as evidence!",Crash
7,rmax304823,Autoerotic and grotesque.,5,4 October 2005,"Kids, read no farther. In fact, leave the room and play Nintendo. And put your dirty socks in the hamper.If you think YOU'RE warped wait until you see the characters who populate this movie. You'll not only emerge from the experience reassured, you'll wind up feeling like a paragon of normality.The story (if that's the word for it) has Spader getting into a head-on smasheroo with a car in which Hunter is a passenger. Her husband is thrown through the windshield and killed. Spader is hospitalized with various pieces of shiny steel holding his long bones in place. He finds the pain and discomfort and immobilization so arousing that when his wife (Unger) visits him it leads to masturbation. There's a lot of that sort of thing in this movie.You'd never think Holly Hunter would suffer from such a paraphilia but she does. So does Spader's wife. Hunter and Spader run into each other, figuratively, in a garage full of wrecked cars and make furious love in one of the surrealistically twisted carcasses.Before you know it, the Spader family and Hunter have fallen in with a group of -- well, there's no easy name for people of this quality. Koteas, the head of this underground cohort, is some sort of show-business stunt driver who, with a few associated, restages fatal car crashes of celebrities. Spader and Hunter are one of a dozen or two spectators who come to watch the staging of the 1955 crash between James Dean's Porsche and a Ford driven by somebody named Turnipseed. None of the men involved in the stunt wear helmets or seat belts and there are no roll bars or any of that wimpy stuff. Koteas' shiny Porsche Spider backs up, then speeds full blast into the front of the Ford. Kaboom. Sirens burping, the cops arrive and everyone scuttles for cover. It is never explained exactly how Koteas makes enough money to smash up beautifully restored Fords and Porsches. (His next big show will involve the decapitation of Jane Mansfield.) At Koteas' home they watch movies of test crashes with dummies instead of porn.Spader's wife has seemed relatively reasonable up to now but she finds herself turned on by crashes, stunt men, and the rest. When she and Spader are making love (this time in bed, not in the back seat), she asks about Koteas. ""Did you see his penis?"" Spader: ""He says it's all scarred from a motorcycle accident."" Unger ecstatically: ""Ewwwww."" Anyway, to get on with it, one thing leads to another -- one thing being crashes and the other being flaming death amidst twisted metal. What with everyone being swept up in the craze and wanting still more of the excitement, the only sensible way to arouse and satisfy your wife is to smash into her car and kill her, right? Two Big Os for the price of one -- Orgasm through Obliteration. So Spader continually rams the convertible driven by his willing wife until it flips over on the side of the highway. But she's not dead after all. ""I'm all right,"" she mumbles. ""Maybe next time. Maybe next time,"" he whispers to her and then does her bloody and half conscious body in the sere grass.So what's it all about, you ask? You might find that SOME people have no idea but I have a very firm answer. I don't know. At one point Spader asks Koteas why he's so interested in this stuff and Koteas replies portentously: ""It's the reshaping of the human body by modern technology."" Gosh.It's an awesome statement but what does it mean? How is modern technology reshaping the human body? Does he mean that vehicular accidents tear it all to bits? Is he somehow thinking of the Thighmaster or simulacrum that imitate rowing or cross-country skiing or walking upstairs? Is Cronenberg really after ROCK HARD ABS? Here's what I think he's up to. It's been called self testing. It's seeing how far you can violate ordinary tastes and still get away with it, rather like a toddler who insists on wobbling along by himself until he either falls down or somebody picks him up. The real message of the movie is that there is no message. It's a highly ritualized violation of the viewer's expectations of taste. A Halloween prank.What else could it be? It's certainly not a realistic portrayal of a bunch of perverts. Where could they possibly get insurance after the first dozen crashes? And the fear and sexual responses are antagonistic, the former mediated by the sympathetic nervous system and the latter by the parasympathetic. Somebody who jumps off a cliff might have a spontaneous ejaculation, a sympathetic reflex, but he's not going to have an erection.I don't mean to pan the movie entirely. Unger and Hunter and Roseanna Arquette are sexy and attractive women. (There's a homosexual encounter involving Spader and Koteas, but it's not sufficiently prolonged or explicit to be anhedonic.) At any randomly chosen moment, the screen will show cars on the highway, cars crashing, people having sex in cars, or people talking about cars crashing and people having sex in cars. And it's neatly directed too. What shiny metal and what frangible flesh! Everything but the bodies seem gleaming and cold.My only problem was that I didn't like it. Not my perversion.",Crash
8,Tweekums,Disturbing... even by Cronenberg's standards,8,3 February 2019,"This film is centred on married couple James and Catherine Ballard; they are in an open relationship and seem to get more pleasure hearing about the others 'activities' than when being intimate together. Then one day James is driving along the freeway and loses control of his car; he ends up in the oncoming traffic and crashes head on with another car. He survives, the driver of the other car is killed and his wife, Dr Helen Remington, appears to be aroused. He meets her again in the hospital and she introduces him to a man named Vaughn, who he'd previously thought to be a hospital worker. It soon becomes apparent that he is part of a strange subculture of people aroused by car crashes... so much so that he and stuntman friends recreate various infamous celebrity crashes; his latest project being the crash that killed James Dean. Soon the Ballards are caught up in this dangerous world.When this film was released it was considered controversial... which probably led to more people watching. Often when that is the case as the years pass one grows to wonder what the fuss was about but this is still quite disturbing. It isn't just the subject matter but the way it is filmed; there are numerous sex scenes but there is something sterile about them; almost as mechanical as the cars many of the scenes take place in. This is clearly deliberate and serves to make the scenes more disturbing than erotic. The cast do an impressive job playing characters who are for the most part cold and detached; the only one who seems to show real emotion is Elias Koteas, who as Vaughan, is most alive when he is about to be involved in potentially fatal car crashes. Overall this is a hard film to recommend but that isn't to say it isn't a good film just one that won't be to everybody's taste.",Crash
9,moonspinner55,A fetish for fender benders...,2,26 November 2016,"Director David Cronenberg took a wrong turn with this failed sex-melodrama about car crashes and climaxes. A young movie producer is involved in a violent two-car smash-up which leaves one man dead and his wife briefly hospitalized--and yet aroused. The producer and the woman begin a sexual relationship with car wrecks as their aphrodisiac--and they're not alone; the producer's wife is already a player in this ungainly game, and so is a local performance artist who is sexually charged by recreating celebrity crashes. Cronenberg, who also adapted J.G. Ballard's novel, was allegedly attracted not to the eroticism prevalent in the material, but rather the opportunity to delve into his characters' scarred and warped psyches (Roger Ebert called the film ""A pornographic movie without pornography in it""). Unfortunately, the characters are a heavy-breathing group of hedonistic (or is that nihilistic?) freaks, pale and vacant-eyed like horny zombies, who seem to have the time and the energy (and the insurance!) to engage in such a lifestyle. What is Cronenberg's point--that death behind the steering wheel represents the ultimate orgasm? If eroticism wasn't Cronenberg's primary objective in tackling this tasteless project, that pretty much leaves everyone involved bumping and grinding without a purpose. Shaken but not stirred, if you will. *1/2 from ****",Crash
10,dbdumonteil,crash is sex,8,19 August 2006,"The title of my review is not meant pejoratively. ""Crash"" is one of these films I completely decried the first time I had watched it. Actually, I reacted like a part of David Cronenberg's fans whereas it's the kind of film that requires a second vision. So, I watched it again recently and I changed my mind about it. If before this screening I tended to put Cronenberg's opus in the place of loser and to underscore its pretentious character, now I would label it as a winner and I would substitute the mentioned epithet for dour.If my memory serves me well, ""Crash"" caused a lot of controversy when it reached the streets ten years ago in some countries including Great Britain. Adapted from a novel written by J.G. Ballard, I think it sharply contrasts with some of the director's precedent works. In these works, the Canadian filmmaker let his taste for bloody horror show through, especially his early films like ""Shivers"" (1975) or ""Rabid"" (1977). However, in some of his films, he managed to shelve these excesses for a more thrifty style. I think of ""Dead Ringers"" (1988). ""Crash"" could rank in this category. There are no bloody sequences. Anyway, it's easy to see why Cronenberg was interested in Ballard's novel. It offered him the opportunity to deepen his set of themes like the degradation of the human body and everything harmful that can happen to it but also the fusion between man and technology (here, it's epitomized by its most trivial symbol: car). What's also amazing from him is that he succeeded in eschewing any didactic style to be as objective as possible. Dialogs are minimal and are mostly self-explanatory like this key cue pronounced by Vaughan: ""the remodeling of human body through modern technology"".So, the main thrust of the film is that the car crash enables to boost man's sexual life. The supposedly love affair between man and the car reaches here its climax. Vaughan even goes to associate car crashes with sexual orgasms. To a certain extent, the clandestine shows in which he reproduces famous crashes constitute a way to follow for people who are unsatisfied with their sexual lives. The Ballard couple whose sexual life is reduced to a series of overnight love affairs realizes it and enjoys this dangerous game in which death could happen before the second part of this design: sexual act. Cronenberg's film goes beyond this to arouse major issues: could technology swallow man? Can the two elements live together? Could the latter lose his identity? There's one sequence I find very strong. It's the one when Catherine and James go to buy a new car and Catherine has hidden her scars under an appearance made of leather and metal. As I said before, Cronenberg opted for a thrifty and sober style. This perspective is shown straight at the outset during the opening credits to the sound of a startling music. Then, the film takes a leap into a dreary universe with a metallic coldness and a gloomy cinematography that Cronenberg never tries to embellish. Relationships between man and the machine are assessed in a hard-hitting way and the characters often speak in a detached manner between themselves. Could car crashes make warm human relationships subside except through sex? Of course, to watch such a difficult film like this one takes guts but for the ones who haven't discovered it yet, ""Crash"" isn't a succession of erotic sequences interspersed with crashes. It's more subtle than that and if Cronenberg chose a more straightforward approach, it's precisely to enable the audience to understand his film and to make us think about the issues he developed here. So, the first vision might leave you baffled so be prepared for a second screening.",Crash
11,Quinoa1984,dangerously erotic work that changes years after seeing it,9,18 December 2006,"David Cronenberg's Crash was one of those ""dirty"" movies I more than likely wasn't supposed to rent let alone watch when the NC-17 cut first came into existence on video (and, if anything, the film was more than an eye-opener in my young teen state, going even further than I had seen at the time with Boogie Nights or Kids). But I didn't pay quite as much attention to the story as I should've, aside from the James Dean subplot (as I remembered it anyway, with Elias Koteas's character), and from the very dark atmosphere. It was almost TOO dark at the time, and I stayed away until recently when it was shown on TV late one night. Seeing it now I'm much more absorbed into the wretchedly but totally, sensually charged work by the actors and the crew, and Cronenberg's utmost trust and professionalism with both. It certainly has that effect on a first viewing of veering way too close into the soft-core boundaries, and even seems like the kind of thing that I used to see in that 'scandalous' section of mainstream adult films as a kid like Last Tango in Paris. But the psychology behind the characters ends up being more striking than anything, and like many of Cronenberg's films, the duality of man (and woman, apparently) comes strongly into play, and the merging of the two as usually becomes the case.James Spader is in one of his very best performances- albeit only somewhat removed from the sexual deviants of Sex Lies & Videotape and Secretary (maybe closer to the latter, however without any of that film's outright satire)- as Ballard, also the author this film is based upon. He gets in a car accident, a horrible one, that kills a doctor and leaves his wife (Holly Hunter) injured both physically and psychologically. But Ballard and his wife (Deborah Kara Unger, very good as well) get brought into this strange world that's been built around Vaughn (Koteas, perhaps in one of his top 3 best pieces of work, very creepy but somehow convincing early on, at least to his new arrivals). He is a man who is completely enveloped into his psyche of car-crash sex, and how history ends up adding a mystique to it all (hence the James Dean references, which are very amusingly pathological). But this all becomes very dangerous, if only on some subversive level, when Ballard, his wife, and Hunter's Helen Remington get involved in this underground cult.Seeing the film again, I'm a lot more struck this time after seeing other Cronenberg work how the style slips so amazingly into the content of the picture. The first time around, the style almost seemed to be just another side to the content, that it was obvious to have such a wild yet controlled technique, particularly for the sex &/or car crash scenes. This is as much a credit to Cronenberg's poetic touches to the material as it is to DP Peter Suschitzky and Howard Shore's music, which somehow rises above being too pornographic to being really touching. In fact, after seeing it again very late at night and not remembering the entire film, I may even need to see it again to let it all sink in. But really this won't be the case for all- the NC-17 rating isn't too unwarranted in this case, even if it's more a rating for the nature of the sexual contact and aggressiveness of the fetishism as opposed to something like the Dreamers where there was blatant nudity a lot of the time. I wouldn't dare recommend the R-rated version, however, as the whole point is to see it all in its un-tarnished view. It's a harsh vision painted here of people reaching out for some kind of connection through the most destructive way imaginable. One thing's for certain, once you've seen it there's no mistaking this from Paul Haggis's Crash (and, for me, this beats out Haggis's contrived good-intention machine any day).",Crash

This is outrageous.A group of people are aiming for Jayne Mansfield and James Dean like fatal accidents. What an awful plot! With today's violence, who needs junk like this for our teens to see?To state that smashing up a car is conducive to sexual freedom is the sickest message one can give.This film should be banned from the universe.",Crash
13,michaelRokeefe,A small group share the same kinky fetish.,6,24 July 2001,"David Cronenberg directs this weird tale of sexual deviance. This movie can be about erotic as it is non-excitable. Explicit sex scenes and graphic language make this a super strong NC-17. After surviving an auto accident that left him maimed,(James Spader)can only be sexually aroused in connection with a car wreck. He meets others that have been disfigured in the same way and they also practice kinky sex at the scene of accidents...real or reconstructed. These people are craving not just the sex act, but the fulfillment of pursuing their fetish.Rounding out this near rated X cast are: Holly Hunter, Rosanna Arquette, Elias Koteas and the alluring Deborah Unger. I caught this on IFC and was mesmerized. I was not offended, just stunned with the subject matter. I hate to think that maybe one of Spader's greatest performances will be his least seen. This is not for every one. Do view it with an opened mind concerning gore, strong language, nudity and homo-sexuality.",Crash
14,Theo Robertson,Unworthy Of The Hype,6,1 May 2004,"This has a really interesting credit sequence of the titles slowly driving towards the screen with a really bleak and haunting soundtrack . Even more interesting is the fact that the music was composed by a then unknown Canadian muscian called Howard Shore who later won Oscars for the pseudo Wagnarian soundtracks to FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING and RETURN OF THE KING
Unfortunately as soon as the title theme stopped so did my interest in the movie . Yeah okay there`s a nice in-joke of having the main protagonist named after the author of the source novel , but this is sandwiched in between three sex scenes that make up the first five minutes of the film . Three sex scenes divided by five minutes doesn`t go because three sex scenes divided by five minutes never = good movie , and the more the movie drove along at an erratic pace the more I found my interest colliding with questions , things like don`t accident investigators investigate who was responsible for fatal crashes ? Don`t they take away all personal items like photographs during an investigation ? Don`t policemen and firemen stop ghouls smoking and taking snap shots at pile ups ? Are Elias Koteas and Christopher Meloni the same person ?It`s impossible to talk about this movie without talking about the controversy it stirred up , and as always the controversy and in some cases bans are totally unfounded . There`s nothing here that will turn a rational sane person or even a slightly deranged one into a sex crazed hell driver . As the real experts ( ie registered IMDB  members ) have pointed out this is a boring uninvolving character study full of unsympathetic characters on the fast track of a nihilistic highway with a dead end . I do wish David Cronenberg would go back to making movies like RABID and THE FLY instead of shocking audiences with explict scenes of kinky sex",Crash
15,Hey_Sweden,"Pretty dreary, but also undeniably fascinating.",7,3 September 2012,"Writer / producer / director David Cronenbergs' grim adaptation of the J.G. Ballard novel tells the story of James Ballard (James Spader), who gets into a horrible car accident that actually has a stunning effect on his life, in particular his sex life. He and wife Catherine (Deborah Kara Unger) find themselves now inexorably drawn to the violence and destruction of car crashes and even the effect that such crashes have on the human body. They soon discover an underground group of people that celebrate this creepy fetish, led by the intense Vaughan (Elias Koteas), who with the help of stuntman friends recreates famous crashes involving celebrities (such as James Dean).Cronenberg is obviously a perfect choice to direct this sort of story, which obviously is not going to appeal to a lot of people but may very well intrigue some. It never gets too far into the heads of its characters, but doesn't really judge them, either, and illustrates how these individuals obsess over creating some sort of meaning in their lives and how human beings can attach a sexual element to just about anything.The weather in this Toronto-shot film is appropriately gloomy, matching the mood of the story telling, while the blood and gore is actually never overdone. Cronenberg keeps the focus on the sexual nature of the story and characters and with the help of his very willing performers creates some very erotic scenes, of both the heterosexual and homosexual variety. There's some caressing of vehicle damage to go with the caressing of human bodies.The deeply committed cast, also including Holly Hunter and Rosanna Arquette, helps to draw you into this tale; Koteas is a standout as Vaughan. Howard Shore supplies a music score in his typical grandiose, full-of-foreboding style.The film isn't perfect overall, as has already been mentioned, but it may keep some viewers watching due to the sexual frankness and explicitness on display. (This is available in both a 90 minute long R rated version and a 100 minute long NC-17 rated version.) Still, even with its flaws it leaves a fairly big impression; it's not likely it'll be easily forgotten.Seven out of 10.",Crash
16,preppy-3,Just horrible,2,5 May 2005,"Sick, pointless film about people who get sexually turned on by car crashes. They stage elaborate reenactments of famous car crashes and they purposefully HAVE car crashes to satisfy themselves.I do admire director David Cronenberg for taking on risky material, but why he chose this is beyond me. The movie has little plot (and what it does moves slowly) and has some good actors giving their worst performances. James Spader, Holly Hunter, Rosanna Arquette are stone-faced throughout the entire movie. Also there's a disgusting sequence involving Arquette and her scars which almost made me turn this off. I DO give the actors credit for doing some pretty raw sexually explicit sequences which earned this film an NC-17. The one between Spader and Elias Koteas was really surprising.If there's a point to this it totally escapes me. I give it a 2 for Cronenberg's good direction and the sex (it's not erotic at all but very interesting). If you must see it get the NC-17 version--the R rated one is cut to ribbons.",Crash
17,poolandrews,Another challenging film from Cronenberg.,5,7 October 2007,"Crash starts as film producer James Ballard (James Spader) is involved in a car crash in which he is badly injured, a man dies & his wife Dr. Helen Remington (Holly Hunter) is also hurt. James becomes fascinated with cars & car crashes, he then meets up with Helen who also has a thing for crashes & they start to have a sexual relationship. They meet up with a guy named Vaughn (Elias Koteas) who is the founder of a small group of people who stage car crashes for their own sexual fulfilment, they listen in on emergency service channels & turn up to car crash accident scenes & take photo's, they get turned on by watching video tapes of car crashes & get off on looking at pictures of people badly hurt in crashes...This Canadian British co-production was written, co-produced & directed by David Cronenberg & is a difficult film to analyse & at times is a difficult film to watch. The script was based on the book Crash by J.G. Ballard first published in 1973 & deals with people who have a fetish for car crashes, I have no idea whether there really are people out there who get turned on by such things but it wouldn't surprise me it there was, & in that respect it's quite a difficult film to relate too as I can't really put myself in any of the character's situations. Cronenberg is a meticulous filmmaker & he knows how to develop character's, how to write dialogue, how to shock & Crash is certainly an extremely well written film with brilliant characterisations. Crash is very much a character driven film rather than an events driven one, the character's dictate the on screen action rather than the other way round. There are some disturbing scenes but the film is never overly graphic or exploitative, people describing car crashes to each other as they have sex, getting turned on by someone else's injuries & voyeuristically looking at real life car crash accidents are strange notions & ideas to try & understand. While watching Crash last night the time flew by, in fact I couldn't believe how quick it went even though it's a relatively slow film so in that respect it certainly grabbed me & drew me in. I'm not to sure whether I enjoyed Crash or not which sounds odd I know but I just can't quite make up my mind whether I did or not & maybe I never will.Director Cronenberg is a top filmmaker & Crash has lots of style & is as artistic as a film about car crashes can be. There's a fair amount of sex both straight & gay plus a fair amount of nudity although it's not gratuitous, there's no blood or gore so forget about anyone having sex with dead bodies or open wounds. Crash was an extremely controversial film when it was released, here in the UK the national tabloids really laid into it & several councils up & down the country banned it although the notoriously strict BBFC passed the full uncut 'Unrated' version intact & is now freely available on DVD here in the UK uncut, personally I think it's the notion & ideas behind the film which are more shocking than what is actually seen on screen. Cronenberg's response to the controversy was brilliant & clever, he simply said 'there are two versions of Crash, one that exists on screen & one that exists in peoples heads' & that to me is the perfect answer because it's so true.With a decent sounding budget of about $10,000,000 Crash is well made, it's striking to look at & Cronenberg is just a great filmmaker & it's as simple & straight forward as that. Shot on location in Toronto in Canada. The film won the Jury Special Prize & the Golden Palm at that years Cannes Film Festival which apparently raised a few eyebrows. The acting is very good from a solid cast.Crash is a difficult film to analyse, sometimes a difficult film to watch but it's never less than fascinating & absorbing in a disturbing sort of way. I'm not sure I can recommend it as I'm not even sure I liked it myself, a real curiosity from Cronenberg.",Crash
18,anaconda-40658,Cronenberg Crash.,8,16 June 2015,"Crash (1996): Dir: David Cronenberg / Cast: James Spader, Holly Hunter, Elias Koteas, Deborah Kara Unger, Rosanna Arquette: Represents the mind when it ceases to function on a normal level. Filmmaker James Spader survives a head on collision. When released from the hospital he encounters the female victim, which leads to heavy sex in what will be linked to a strange fascination with car crashes. Elias Koteas is obsessed with celebrity crashes and stages a James Dean crash. He invites Spader's wife to pose beside a roadside accident to complete his inspiration. Spader readjusts a rear view mirror in a car wash as his wife is raped in the backseat and moans with pleasure. Although extremely disturbing it is among David Cronenberg's more symbolic work, which also includes The Dead Zone and Scanners. Spader is well cast in his descend on mental chaos. Holly Hunter is intriguing as a crash victim although she seems to become less involved in the second half and settles for a lesbian fling in a crash car. Koteas is at best in his delight of the sickening but his final sequence makes little sense. Deborah Kara Unger discovers new passions in road games, which results in a very twisted ending where Spader whispers, ""Maybe the next time."" Rosanna Arquette wearing leg braces and an appetite for kink. Graphic sex in variation resulting in a fatal crash of the mind. Score: 8 / 10",Crash
19,gradyharp,The Etiology of Sexual Arousal: Edge of Life Terror,8,19 October 2005,"David Cronenberg takes chances and his pushing the edge of cinematic art is what makes his films so interesting. JG Ballard's controversial novel CRASH seemed an unlikely prospect for a film, so dark were its explorations of the outer zones of excitation and their relationship to near-death events. But Cronenberg worked through making Ballard's visions visual and his screenplay based on Ballard's book is more about interior dialogue and visceral sexual encounters as they relate to trauma.James Ballard (James Spader) is a successful TV director who spends as much time as a lothario as he does making film. He is married to Catherine (Deborah Kara Unger) whose own sexuality leads her into stray paths. The two seem to connect physically but the fire is diminishing: they both concur that encounters with other partners enhance their sexual experiences. James is in a car accident and survives with a broken leg and scars, but the other car's male driver was killed and his surviving female companion Helen Remington (Holly Hunter) is hospitalized with James. While in the hospital both encounter a strange, scarred, limping male photographer Vaughn (Elias Koteas) who takes photos of the scars and trauma results of both James and Helen. Catherine visits James in the hospital and seems to find excitement in the scars and orthopedic paraphernalia binding her husband.Once James is released from the hospital he is strangely drawn to the car he wrecked and finds Helen in the same mindset. The two move into physical attraction as well as an emotional attraction to Vaughn. Vaughn is obsessed with auto accidents, having been in many, and he stages famous car accidents (James Dean, Jayne Mansfield, etc) for a captive audience - which includes James, Helen, and Catherine. Vaughn insidiously draws the three into his obsession, sharing his 'actors' and fellow travelers - including Gabrielle (Rosanna Arquette - with both legs in orthopedic mechanisms), Colin and Vera Seagrave (Peter MacNeill and Cheryl Swarts) and those who help him stage his 'accidents'. Vaughn explains that he is exploring how to achieve that sensation of terror one feels during a car crash and equate it with orgasm. The odd group of folks all sexually interact with abandon: the crashed car becomes the bedchamber for bizarre sexual acting out. And how this all plays out in the end is the part of the film that simply must be seen to feel the experience.This is clearly NOT a movie for everyone. The CD contains both the NC and the R rated version: I watched the NC version and while it is graphic and focused on sex it is oddly uninvolving emotionally - we care little about the people we meet. Perhaps part of the story here is that with the progressively dehumanization of man in his symbiotic relationship with machines, relating to fellow humans on anything except the sensual gratification is something we are losing. That is the kind of powerful statement Cronenberg shows us with these passionate yet cold people. The cast is exceptional, especially Koteas whose warped character is wholly three-dimensional as opposed to the oddly uninvolved characters Spader, Unger, and Hunter portray. A dizzying experience! Grady Harp",Crash
20,The_Void,Cronenberg crashes and burns,7,23 December 2004,"David Cronenberg has matured from a director of good films, to a director of mediocre ones. It's a huge shame that this has happened as the man definitely has talent, but recently he's been wasting it on films such as 'eXistenZ, 'Spider' and now this. Crash is a film that has the story to be a provocative tale, detailing obscure sexual tastes, but instead it's nothing more than another lame drama that is empty when it should have been deep and complex. James Spader plays James Ballard; a man that is involved in a car crash, and later finds himself involved with a bunch of weirdo perverts that, for some reason, take pleasure from car crashes. These people recreate famous car crashes, such as James Deans', for fun, and find taking pictures of car crashes, and the fact that a car crash mangles people's bodies, arousing. The fact that it is never explained why they do this is most probably meant to be a commentary on sexual tastes, as many people have certain tastes for no particular reason...but it falls down because as we don't know why they do it, the premise fails to be fascinating.This film oozes a deep and arty feel throughout, but it's really just a cover for the fact that this film is hollow and empty; and devoid of anything resembling art. Cronenberg has packed the movie with sex scenes. These are, obviously, relevant to the plot and, at times, are even quite erotic but due to his poor characterisation, we have no reason to care about anything shown; making this a glorified porn movie. In a movie named 'Kissed' (also released in 1996), we are presented with the subject of strange sexual desires. Kissed deals with a more outlandish subject material than this movie, but it never indulges in showing us sex scenes; putting the focus firmly on the subject material, the character and the fascination they hold for their desire, but because this film does indulge more than a little bit; it doesn't get inside it's subject material, rendering it a rather trite and pointless viewing. Especially since if you're watching a proper porn movie, you don't have to suffer the talking scenes in between the sex. All in all, this is not recommended viewing.",Crash
21,zetes,Works best if you're familiar with Cronenberg beforehand,7,16 May 2000,"Crash fits perfectly in David Cronenberg's canon. It has the same fascination with cold, mechanical images that we see in The Fly and Videodrome. If this is your first Cronenberg film, you'll be understandably lost. It is certainly not his best, though. I like the film particularly for its boundary-pushing. Boy, does it push some boundaries! It has many unique and fascinating scenes. But it has one major problem: once it shows us its ideas, it sort of just repeats over and over. It never really goes anywhere with its ideas. It should have ended at least twenty or thirty minutes before it did. But no one on Earth wants to see James Spader have sex with Elias Koteas. Oh, disturbing image! 7/10",Crash

23,christopher-underwood,So why such healthy divergence of opinion?,9,2 November 2005,"Almost ten years on and this still looks wonderful but causes all sorts of emotions running wild. Still difficult to write about too AND evaluate if the IMDb scoring is anything to go by. This gets as many one's as sixes and almost as many as it get ten, hence the mean average of just over five. So why such healthy divergence of opinion? I think really this film presents it's 'attraction' so uncompromisingly centre stage that with everybody being essentially different, they get to experience this film differently and with no normal narrative or back story/love affair, we have to confront the whole, sex/mutilation/death issue each his own way. Everything in this film is so cool, we have no guidance as to with whom our sympathies might rest with, we have to confront this issue, uncomfortable though it may be. I don't believe that anybody actually 'gets off' on all the sexualised violence here depicted but everybody must relate to a larger or lesser extent to what is essentially an issue of fetishism. Over the past ten years we have become more used to seeing SM or bondage orientated advertising and there is clearly massive affinity to what we once imagined such a small world, but whether that world is even yet ready for this is most unlikely.",Crash

As watching many David Cronenberg movies you know that they are different and raw and often travel on the edge and show the dark nature of life. With this picture ""Crash"" it shows just how people can become obsessed with pleasure after near fatal death. Really watching this is like a psycho sexual journey. Anyway James Spader is James Ballard a film director who in his spare time likes having sex with Asian ladies as his wife Catherine(Deborah Kara Unger)is somewhat of a bore to him. Well after James becomes involved in a near fatal car crash the incident leads to a meeting with Dr. Helen Remington(Holly Hunter)and soon the two develop a passion and an erotic attraction it's now a cat and mouse game of car sex and this underground underworld is a culture of raw violence and raw sexual conquest(Note I really enjoyed the scene of Holly in that silk satin sexy purple colored bra!) This film is clearly different as it explores erotic means and sexual ends in a raw and different way from the norm yet it proves and shows that people's attraction and energy is not the norm when involving sex and passion. ""Crash"" is one cult classic film that stands on it's own.",Crash
26,thesar-2,Crash and Bump,2,23 December 2009,"""Tagline: the most controversial film you will ever see."" Uh, I think I've seen more controversial before and since. What I settled on was: the most bizarre and plot-less movie I've seen.While I'll admit, I honestly didn't really get most of what 1996's Crash is all about, but the jist is: female nudity, swingers and sex, mostly around vehicles.Here's what I did get out of it: an open-relationship couple James (Spader) and Catherine (Unger) not only get around, they compare notes with each other. I'm guessing they're so unsatisfied with each other, so depressed in life, that they need the company of strangers. That all changes (or advances) when James ""accidentally"" crashes into a new sexual awaking, involving steal, metal and automobile demolition with a head on collision. We're asked to not necessarily accept one's unique sexual desire to be at its peak during a car crash, but acknowledge to each their own – a philosophy I live by, unless it harms another living being. This, however, leads into one of the problems I had with the movie: the lack of realism. While stunt-driver/James Dean lover Vaughan (Koteas) isn't all there upstairs to begin with, Helen (Hunter) is all-but non-responsive when her husband is killed in the same crash that James caused. In fact, her only reaction is to get better soon enough, so her and James can have sex in a car in the airport's parking garage. Okay, fine, again to each their own, but you have to suspect the sanity of some of these character who are so detached from natural human instincts whether it be shock, anger, hatred, fear, love, depression, something, anything.The rest of the movie generally gets stranger and stranger as all characters in the movie push forward into more graphic and mechanical sex until their addition demands more. And that's what this is, right? Sexual addiction, whatever the means that turns these people on and like all addictions, it's progressive. One must keep feeding it to get that ""high."" For whatever reason these people feel its necessary to mix intercourse with intersections, it's highly dangerous to themselves and others. This is where I pull back from the ""each their own."" When someone is so selfish in their own desires, they ignore others that could be hurt, maimed or, of course, killed.Regardless of their self-centeredness, there's really not much more to this story. You could've easily been watching yet another film about drug addicts and watch how their lives alter from when they were just a social druggie to $600/day degenerate. And though I don't agree with the ""controversial"" comment (and if that's the only reason they made this, to make a controversial film, then I lost all respect for the filmmakers) you almost have to admire these people for making a very original film, albeit based on a very uninteresting subject. Side Note: I did have to laugh out loud as this movie reminded me, strangely enough, as a line from Student Bodies. I could imagine any one of the characters from that movie saying in Crash, ""Cars make me hot!"" or ""Wrecks (or wrecked cars) make me hot!"" I guess, this means I didn't take the movie too seriously, and why should I when you get one (probably) unintentionally silly scene after another. Yeah, this did push my so-called ""open mind"" to other's unique hobbies a bit far.",Crash
27,gridoon,Well-shot but dramatically uninvolving.,4,8 February 2003,"It's certainly a well-shot film, and the blue-ish cinematography has its own kind of beauty. But it's so far removed from reality, so lacking in normalcy, that it's impossible for the viewer to get involved in it. And the characters are so devoid of basic human emotions, such as jealousy, anger, guilt or sorrow, that they end up looking more like aliens wandering on our planet by accident. If you want to make a provocative and shocking film, you should set it in an at least vaguely realistic world, so that there can be a contrast between the ""normal"" and the ""shocking""; if your world is warped from the beginning, the impact just isn't the same. The film also suffers from an excessive amount of sex scenes (about 14, if I counted correctly), and there is one scene, involving Rosanna Arquette's scars, that is REALLY icky. (*1/2)",Crash
28,paul2001sw-1,"Driving around in cars, with sex",6,15 May 2004,"David Cronenburg's interesting but flawed film 'Crash', adapted from James Ballard's novel (Ballard also gives his name to the leading character), attracted huge amounts of controversy on its release and has one of the most striking voting profiles on IMDB that I have seen - also equal returns for every number from 1 to 10.  In fact, there's a lot of admire in this sweaty, atmospheric adaptation that perfectly captures the sense of heightened alienation that charactersises much of Ballard's prose.  While among the cast, Deborah Kara Unger is sexy as always, Elias Koteas is suitably creepy and even James Spader is kind-of OK, if you don't mind him doing that ""lost little college boy grown up to be a pervert"" thing that he first perfected as Graham in 'Sex, Lies, and Videotape', a role he basically reprises here.But - and let's get real for a minute - this is a film about people who are turned on by car crashes! Now, what the hell is that all about?  If you ask me, the film is trying to say something about the need for transgression in an age with no real taboos - so its characters push at an endlessly receding door, until in the end only death itself can offer a way out.  The problem is that the film suffers from the same problems as the world it portrays - these people have no moral rules, so their actions carry no implications beyond themselves - which leaves us with an idea, with happenings, but no narrative ""drive"" as such.  Without anything to set against their nihilistic desires, 'Crash' coveys no sense of tragedy; just driving around in cars, with sex.",Crash

However, I thought the movie wasn't that great because I didn't really understand the whole story line, I felt it was too rushed and all over the top!I really didn't think Hunter and Spader's characters weren't really the match for each other and it was like, they were forced to do the sex scenes rather than enjoying them in a passionate way.

32,Rodrigo_Amaro,Strange Obsession + Strange Love = Awesome and Controversial Movie,10,20 May 2010,"Car crashes happens accidentally or sometimes deliberately, sometimes people get killed and other times not. But most of the times it's a shocking thing to see one and think about what happened and why happened and who got injured or died. And of course we know that there are people who likes to live fast, die young, leave themselves a beautiful corpse quoting James Dean. In David Cronenberg's film ""Crash"" we see a different kind of people: those who like to get involved in car crashes and/or have sexual relations after a car crash or inside of a damaged car. Here, James Ballard (James Spader) is a film director who got involved in a fatal car crash that killed a man and injured a woman, Helen (Holly Hunter) and they both start a strange relationship (I don't know if I can say if they're friends, lovers or something similar). He is married with Catherine Ballard (Deborah Kara Unger) but here's another awkward thing between these couple: they're unfaithful to each other and still they don't find anything wrong with that. And more, they find this factor something more exciting to their relationship. Helen presents to James a different world when people enjoy re-enactments of famous car crashes (such as James Dean and Jayne Mansfield accidents). Vaughan (Elias Koteas) is the leader of a group who enjoys these re-enactments and he present these famous accidents along with some stunts. Serious things, they smash one car against another to feel more live, or sexually excited. Vaughan introduces James into this new world where there's no limits, everything is allowed including induce an accident in a highway filled with another cars (by the way James's wife is included in these ""accidents""); plan re-enactments; switch sexual partners and other bizarre things.An interesting point in this film is that there's no limit of what characters want sexually from each other here. Vaughan is sexually attracted by James and they have their moment together and so the female characters with each other. They got so involved in share their feelings, their emotions, their sexuality, that they don't stop what they're doing and they go along. And yet no one can label these characters as gay, bisexual or lesbian, no, they're only share an experience. This might work for some viewers. In fact the whole movie might work well for very few people. It's a deep film about the complexities of the human mind, looks very much like ""The Silence of the Lambs"" (I choose compare this films because both are stories of people you don't see everyday and their strange and peculiar worlds. Besides that it's almost impossible compare these two films). All characters are sick people but they just don't know that and the more danger they get, more closer to death they get the more they liked it, the more closer they get to an orgasm or a different sensation. It's very similar to the movies featuring a psycho killer that feels pleasure in what he does and he can't stop doing it because he feels better this way. Vaughan is a dangerous psycho killer in a certain way. Those re-enactments are dangerous things and he jumps in the car knowing that he might die by crashing with another car, face to face with death but after the crash he only lift his hand to the audience and says: ""And that's how James Dean entered to immortality"" and everyone is applauding. For the common viewer it's difficult to see some of the images (more about sex and not the car crashes), and even to follow Cronenberg or J.G.Ballard's idea (who wrote the book). Sometimes it might look a shallow and pointless movie but it has something more, something appealing for those who like twisted obsessions, or for those who might feel that the characters behavior is a normal thing. Once again another great and controversial work from David Cronenberg. Good performances here too (most notable Elias Koteas for his terrifying portrayal of a strange person and James Spader). Such an unforgettable movie but don't get confused with ""Crash"" (2004) directed by Paul Haggis. Lucky that both movies received an subtitle in my country so it's almost difficult to confuse them: Cronenberg's was released under the name of ""Crash - Strange Pleasures"" and Haggis's ""Crash - Living on the Edge"". Both are great but this film is far more shocking and great. 10/10",Crash

34,johnnyboyz,"'Controversial' doesn't equal 'classic'  remove the director's license, if anything.",3,12 October 2007,"I don't know about other people but when I think of car crashes I think of destruction; I think of death; I think of loss; I think of the time and effort that it'll take to rectify not only the situation involving how the hell you're going to get around now the car's gone but also how you're supposed to recover from the shock of it. In David Cronenberg's ridiculous attempt at a film, when the character's think of a car crash, they think of sex and then some more sex and then even more sex after that.When I watch a film, I like them to have plots and developments and characters I don't spend the whole time despising for one reason or another. Sometimes, hating characters is good and can be done cleverly: disliking an evil character or not liking the ways in which certain characters go about their business can also be good fun but when you see a film that is just a barrage of sex scenes, bizarre characters talking like they're in some sort of drug induced stupor and silly, unbelievable developments; it's very difficult to not only switch your mind off to what's going on but also be tempted to not switch the film off.Alas, Crash is a film that just wants to shock. It's like an eight year old child that you get in stores or any other public place, begging their parents for more of what they already have and making a really big deal about absolutely nothing for no reason; it's like the attention hungry child who wants everyone to notice them or the co-worker who 'bigs' themselves up to the point where you just don't care because you don't believe what you're hearing  in Crash's case, it's 'hearing'. A film critic or maybe they were a film theorist once said that: ""Cinema is a way of looking into other people's lives  people who only exist on screen and have no knowledge of the camera and us."" In essence, this is what Crash is: it's a portal into the lives of James Ballard (Spader) his close to constantly naked wife Catherine (Kara Unger) who always talks like she's just had a shot of heroin and they're relationship which breaks up a little when James finds time to hang out with a bunch of equally annoying freaks in the form of Vaughn (Koteas), Gabrielle (Arquette) and a few other dregs whose main turn on are car crashes. This is one portal I wished I hadn't looked through.Crash just consists of a bunch of random sex scenes between two characters we don't even know in the first third, then consists of sex scenes between two characters we don't even give a damn about in the second third before trying to end up as some sort of tragic, poetic love story about two people who have now discovered what really sexually turns them on. Needless to say, it misses that particular mark by an absolute light year. There is one scene that is constructed and shot in such a way that it could resemble a sex scene in a film even though it's not. It's the scene when James and Vaughn are driving slowly past a crash site as Vaughn takes pictures of various things; getting off over the blood, the death and the way the victims are trapped: the camera shots are close ups of numerous things such as the still bodies, the blood on the door and the way the pliers are applied by the firemen as they crank down and break off the metal framework blocking them from rescuing the victims  this is not only disturbing in the sense it's supposed to be entertaining but odd that the film-makers assume that we even care about what's going on and think we will like these characters.Crash is a film that fetishises car crashes and glorifies them as if they're as desirable as sex is. In fact, take away most of Vaughn's dialogue and some scenes involving characters talk about nothing in particular and the film would be pornography. Pornography doesn't need to have a plot but when it does, I'm sure it's at a very basic level with minimal character development and talking; again, Crash fits these two descriptions and it's absolutely shocking  Crash is quite easily a wreck of a 'film' and probably one of the worst I've ever seen.",Crash

The story takes us through the life of a man who realizes the underworld of people that share his extremely dangerous fetish and, as his motive is to only utilize his fetish to improve sex with his wife, he and other participants grow obsessed with it and it becomes a lifestyle.I praise the film's daring exploration of one of the deepest, darkest, least communicated subjects, and the last line and the following closing shot are both emotionally haunting, but that aside, I was disappointed with David Cronenberg's deviation from his usual style, an unmistakable emotional involvement dominantly glimpsed in the musical score. Crash has his quiet, slow-flowing atmosphere but without its punctuating verve in the cinematography and music, both of which are like that of a movie made for television. The film is successfully black and blue, and the music hits the right notes, no pun intended, in the evocation of sexiness and seduction its jazzy saxophone and keyboard were going for, though it sounds perhaps synthesized.The high points of the film are no doubt its sex scenes, beautifully and realistically choreographed, for the most part avoiding Hollywoodization. Characters sweat, hump, intertwine, and lust. The laconia of the main character's sex with his wife and the single- minded, desperately passionate lustsex are very clear in Cronenberg's discreet way.",Crash
37,videorama-759-859391,"Cronenberg's most original, and originally daring is a must be seen",8,10 April 2014,"I take my hat off to original films like this, Cronenberg, his most daring work yet, where he's moved off from horror here. A trio of sex scenes for starters convinces us of that. A t.v director (Spader-adequate, but I really say, more miscast) has a head on smash, with another driver, the female passenger Hunter, oddly caressing her open breast, in the wake of the collision in full view of Spader. They meet up again, days later, Spader back in the driver's seat. He becomes drawn into a secret world of crash victims, who are sexually stimulated, by having sex in cars. Bringing the sexy and sexually unfulfilled wife, (Unger) into the group, could be an answer to their dry spell of a sex time. Wild card actor, Koteas, one of my favourite thespians, is flawlessly cast as, Vaughn, an adrenaline junkie driver, one of the very scarred, while also working as a doctor, who lives in his car. His wild rage exit at the end is smashingly great. One scene has him picking up a woman at the airport. He has sex with her, a sort of menais de trois, with out the third, a stiff driving Spader. A funny scene, has crippled Arguette, another of the group, trying out this new car, or more correctly, trying to see if she can find a perfectly designed car, fit for a perfectly designed body, while tearing up the upholstery, where Spader in the background, is trying to suppress his amusement. The best bit of Crash, of course, is the re-enactment of the James Dean car crash, truly authentic, these supposed stunt guys not mucking around, Vaughn, of course sitting in the drivers seat of the late great film star, while observers of the group watch from a stadium. Whatever your fancy, Crash, is different, one of the most original films I've seen in a while. It's style of originality is it's own self, where I recommend you see it once, then make up your mind.

Shortly afterwords, he is driving down the road and crashes head on into another car. A man goes through the windshield, but his wife, played by Holly Hunter is bloodied, and she is shown in the passenger seat without a bra, and her breast is noticed by Spader. He is bruised and recovering at a hospital and meets the survivor by chance, in the hallway. For some unknown reason, he visits the salvage yard to look at his wrecked car; and guess who just happens to be there at the same time; Holly Hunter, of course. He drives her to the airport and they have sex in the front seat of his car after discussing the bad traffic situation. He then goes back to his wife, and they get frisky. They apparently have an open marriage. We then meet a guy, Vaughan, who is obsessed with car accidents. He even reenacts the James Dean crash from 1955 with the same Porsche. Rosanna Arquette is Vaughan's prosthetic wearing friend, and we are given plenty of strange sexual quirks, such as scar worship.

Whilst it is controversial for a few scenes, its actual problem is that it a bad film. Director David Cronenberg has made so excellent films in many different genres, but Crash is a very shallow, nihilistic film about nothing. There are many problems with the film, it has the visual look and style of a TV film, characters with not much characterisation, people speaking in quiet tones and James Spader was a bland lead. Despite the film's attempts to have a said about the changing nature of sexuality in the world of technology, a look at subcultures, how people enjoy danger and thrills and sexual fetishes.

42,dee.reid,"""Crash"" does not ""Crash"" & burn",8,20 April 2015,"BEWARE: 1996's ""Crash"" is not the same 2004 film directed by Paul Haggis that won Best Picture at the Academy Awards for 2005; I still think that ""Brokeback Mountain"" should have won that year, and that remains one of the biggest disappointments in Oscar history, but I digress.No.""Crash"" is the infamous 1996 erotic psychological thriller from the controversial Canadian born-&-bred David Cronenberg (""The Fly,"" ""Dead Ringers,"" ""Videodrome,"" ""Scanners""), who both wrote and directed the film, and also served as a producer. ""Crash"" is by far the most provocative and sexually explicit film Cronenberg has ever done - going so far as to earn the dreaded ""NC-17"" rating, yet still somehow winning the Special Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival, and being nominated also for the prestigious Palme d'Or. That says something for a film that borders on being soft-core pornography, or does it?Despite its graphic depiction of human sexuality (most of it taking place behind the wheel, rather than in the bedroom), Cronenberg is actually striving for something bigger here, which is how people are transformed, physically, psychologically and SEXUALLY, by the car crash (and to a greater extent, how human beings are being transformed by technology itself). ""Crash"" examines this by peering into a world that examines the cathartic sexual release granted to some by automobile accidents. It's a premise that will certainly make people think twice about getting behind the wheel again, and is a premise that also caused a huge sensation when the late author J.G. Ballard published his controversial novel - from which this film is based - of the same name back in 1973. (Quite frankly, it's very easy to imagine how unnerved some people might have been in 1996 after viewing this movie in the theater, and then thinking about the drive home afterward.)In the words of one observer, the characters in ""Crash"" ""are their own potential killers, who make themselves vulnerable to death every time they climb into their conveyances."" Set in Ontario, Canada, bored film director James Ballard (James Spader, an obvious stand-in for the author of the original novel) seeks greater sexual experiences than the mundane pleasures offered to him by his crumbling open marriage to his wife Catherine (Deborah Kara Unger). One night, Ballard gets into a serious, near-fatal car accident - a head-on collision with another vehicle - and winds up in the hospital, horribly scarred and with his left leg in a rather scary-looking contraption that I'm only guessing is a leg brace of some sort.While recovering at the hospital, he learns that the accident killed the driver of the other car, but left the passenger, Dr. Helen Remington (Holly Hunter), a widow. He also by chance meets Dr. Remington's associate Vaughan (Elias Koteas), a car accident-obsessed, slightly mad rogue doctor who leads an underground sub-culture that re-stages famous car crashes - the September 30, 1955, car crash that killed Hollywood movie star James Dean gets a lot of special attention here.Vaughan's special little ""project"" aims to examine how the energy of a car crash is not only a form of sexual catharsis, but is also a trans-formative, or ""fertilizing"" (rather than destructive), event for the crash victim - something that happens to liberate the victim from the boundaries of (what we consider to be) normal sexual experience, which, of course, is provided they even SURVIVE the crash in the first place. Himself a badly scarred car crash survivor, his re-staging of famous car accidents is a ploy to open up new sexual horizons for others, and he's pulled Ballard, who is by no means an unwilling participant (in fact, his initial car accident was a baptism, of sorts), into his dark world of ""auto-erotica"" in an effort to gain sexual satisfaction from his marriage to Catherine. Sex happens a lot in this picture, most of it in cars (hence the spin on the term, ""auto-erotica""), between men and women, women and women, and men and men; it shows that Cronenberg doesn't like to play favorites and since his movie is about pushing boundaries, there's also some ""scar play"" in there, as well - look at what Gabrielle (Rosanna Arquette) is wearing to the party.As a long-time fan of David Cronenberg (""The Fly"" still remains his masterpiece to me), I've waited a long time to see ""Crash,"" as it shows that he was gradually moving away from the so-called ""body horror"" that defined much of his early career and also like the characters in this film, he was seeking new horizons to explore. Of course since the beginning of the 21st century, Cronenberg's profile has gone increasingly mainstream and he has been heavily involved in making thrillers of various types - ""A History of Violence"" (2005) and ""Eastern Promises"" (2007) come to mind - that have explored new thematic territories but his boundary-pushing auteur style and philosophical fascinations of bodily destruction remain largely unchanged.""Crash"" is a controversial (albeit needlessly so) film, no doubt, from a controversial, yet endlessly masterful and fascinating, filmmaker. It's dark, it's sexually explicit and grotesquely violent in many areas, but like all of Cronenberg's work, you just can't turn away - no matter how repulsed or disgusted you are by everything that you're seeing. ""Crash"" is by no means for those with a weak stomach - heed the ""NC-17"" rating, folks - but it is something that can open your eyes and stimulate your senses in ways few filmmakers are willing to do anymore.8/10",Crash

Everybody know that what appeared torrid in 1995 is undoubtedly tepid by today's 2007) standards. The admirable quality of this film is Cronenberg's decision to film Ballard's book which has 3 most venerable elements known to human civilization:cars, closeness between a man and a woman and James Dean. No one will ever venture any inane guesswork that a film featuring the above elements can ever remain unnoticed. As human beings are always engage themselves in perpetual search for thrills in their hollow lives they end up doing things as portrayed in Crash.

CRASH features a typically dull James Spader getting entangled with a group of car crash fetishists and having sex with various people including Holly Hunter and a hobbling Roseanna Arquette.

47,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Lesser Talked About Cronenberg Film with Interesting Subject Matter,7,5 September 2019,"This is one of the David Cronenberg films I haven't seen yet and that it came out after his heyday in horror. You don't hear a lot about this one, but it was on my list of horror films to check out. Having seen it, it doesn't necessarily classify as a horror film, but it is dark enough that I can see the reason to include it here. The synopsis is after getting into a serious car accident, a TV director discovers an underground sub-culture of scarred, omnisexual car-crash victims who use car accidents and the raw sexual energy they produce to try to rejuvenate his sex life with his wife.We start with a woman in a hanger. She is Catherine Ballard (Deborah Kara Unger). A man is with her and he puts his hand up her skirt. The two of them make love. It then shifts to a set where it looks like they're filming a car crash test footage. They're looking for the director, but he's no where to be found. We end up seeing that he's the camera room with the cinematographer. He is James Ballard (James Spader). He's married to Catherine, but we see later that they have kind of an open marriage where they tell each other about their sexual encounters while also making love to each other.Things all change when James gets in a horrific car accident. He isn't paying attention to the road and veers off into the other lane. He collides with Helen Remington (Holly Hunter) and her husband. The husband goes through the windshield into James' car, killing him. She oddly flashes him one of her breasts while they're sitting in the wreckage, waiting for help.James has to recover in the hospital with a large brace on his left leg. Catherine visits him there and it turns out, Helen is there as well. The two of them meet in the hallway along with Vaughan (Elias Koteas). He used to do work at the hospital, but is now obsessed with car accidents. James and Helen spark up a fling that takes them to a performance Vaughan is putting on with two stunt drivers reenacting James Deen's fatal accident. It actually ends in a real car accident.The two of them descend into this group that also includes Gabrielle (Rosanna Arquette), who has some large scars from her own accident and she has to walk with a full body brace. James tries to pull Catherine into it as well, but it becomes darker the more the deeper they get into this interesting fetish.Now coming into this, I expected more of writer/director David Cronenberg was known for, which was body horror. We do get some of that here. I normally hold off talking about effects, but I will cover that and get it out of the way. This film isn't graphic in this department like The Fly or Videodrome. There are some interesting scars though on James, Gabrielle and Vaughan from previous accidents. They look quite real and painful if I'm honest. The film is also shot very well, including making these car accidents look realistic.What caught me off-guard though was when I went to start this film and it asked me if I wanted the R rated or the NC-17 cut. I tend to enjoy the most graphic version of the film, so I watched the latter. The thing that I noticed early on is that James and Catherine are sexualized from the start. I don't see an issue with their marriage set up if both parties agree. It is intriguing though that after James descends into the madness with this group, that we see it effecting Catherine. She's interested at first. Once she gets a taste though, she's not into it, but she seems to go along with what James wants which includes the ending. It does seem she both parties know there's something wrong with their relationship.This odd cult of people is into some really weird things. I'm not here to kink shame them by any stretch, but what I took from it is that their horrific car accidents made them feel alive. From then, they aren't really into men or women, but just the pleasure. It is also interesting to see people interact with them who are 'normal'. The highly sexualized nature intrigues them and definitely seduces. I took from it that the need to feel alive after they survived this trauma is what is driving them. It also drives them back to car accidents as well.I'll move next to the pacing of the film, which I thought was good. It doesn't take long to get it into it and then when it did, I was interested in learning more about what was going on here. Seeing a couple like James and Catherine getting sucked into this was fitting, but despite their relationship, it is too much. It is a descent into madness of the sorts that's shown differently for the two, but makes sense. I thought the ending was fitting for what we got here. This film really isn't exciting per say. It really is more a character study of sorts.What really carries this film is the acting. Spader I thought was really good, as he brings a sense of arrogance to the role. At first I didn't like it, but we are shown his life and how it changes after the accident. Seeing the depravity that he needs was interesting to see play out. Hunter was solid as well. Her and James meeting is feeling a kinship from what they went through. The only thing would be to see her before the accident would have helped me to see if she was like James and Catherine or not. This actually might be Koteas best role I've seen him in. He is so crazy here that I thought it worked great for the movie. Shout outs to Unger and Arquette as well, they along with the rest of the cast. They rounded out the film for what was needed. We also get to see pretty much all of the women I named nude if that interests you.Now with that said, this is an intriguing film for sure. It really feels like Cronenberg transitioning from his horror roots to the more arthouse films he does now. This is really a dark tale of desire and descending into depravity in the sense of what is accepted. Some could question if this is horror, I would say you would probably be right, but I can make a case for how this feels and what these people do could be considered that. It is paced in a way that intrigued me, but I wouldn't say it is exciting. The ending was something that I really liked and worked for me. The acting is great across the board. There aren't a lot in the way of effects, but the scars and car accidents do look quite real. The soundtrack of the film didn't really stand out to me, but fit for what was needed. I will say that I don't think this is a great film; it definitely explores some interesting things though. Can't recommend this to everyone, but if you like more art films, I'd say give this a viewing.",Crash

It's not even like that's an offensive idea. You just kind of go ""OK fine! And...?""

There is no further point to embroider after the first sex/crash juxtaposition. It devovles into an absurd texture of meaningless sex scenes and it just makes you laugh in derision every few minutes. It has no dramatic arc (Thanks to flat, art-house poseur direction & line readings). I sat there resenting that it wasn't deeper as David Lynch might have pulled off, or that it wasn't funnier like John Waters could've done.

The story of a small group of disaffected people who converge in the discovery of their fetish for car accidents, he creates what no one else would even consider since neither go together and no amount of theorizing about orgasm being the ""little death"" can sum up what happens in this movie. Of course, this is not a conventional film, neither of the actors involved are playing conventional roles -- in short, this is by far the strangest movie to come by in years, and Croneberg is no walk in the park. Anyone who considers this erotica might hit a wall since there isn't a sexually charged scene here despite their repeated, graphic inserts among the main players. Science fiction it may be but its classification as such is elusive at best. The universe of J. G. Ballard is a parallel world where new societies exist side-by-side with the 'norm' and people undergo transformations, usually intrinsic with death, metal, and leather, and independent of gender. Because of this, CRASH is too uninvolved to be anything but an intellectual experience, but one that made me think: what's the purpose?",Crash
50,p-stepien,Distant and detached - if HAL3000 made a movie...,5,24 November 2012,"""Crash"" remains Cronenberg's most controversial movies. Permeating with sex and obscenity, coupled with obsessions of both bodily and mechanical nature, it was born on shock factor. Film producer James Ballard (James Spader) and his promiscuous wife Catherine (the voluptuous Deborah Kara Unger) lead a life of mutually accepted sexual ventures, searching for ultimate satisfaction by indulging into various affairs. A car accident featuring Helen Remington (Holly Hunter) introduces another level of compulsive sexual mania - where sexual desires and metal mesh together to form a hybrid of death, car crashes and orgiastic pleasure. This introduces both James and Catherine to the Vaughan (Elias Koteas) and their common spiralling search for fulfilment, where boundaries are pushed further and further, while sperm leaks by the gallons...A story less about the addiction to sex or dangerous driving, but more about the growing infatuation with the mechanical, as it slowly overrides bodily desires to entail technoorganic fulfilment. As a car becomes a subject of desire, craving and our bodies seem to merge with its leather seats and metallic odour, Cronenberg shows a new phase of humanity. One devoid of emotion, cold and ever expanding, as desire becomes limitless to the death. Taking the issue of automotive obsession to the extreme ""Crash"" manages to pack an uneasy wallop, one however that is overlong and for half its running time directionless. Once the premise is clear characters indulge into sexual deviance to sexual deviance with each passing scene pushing themselves further, when the previously passed boundary no longer satisfies the growing need. Although the gist is evident the tirade of weird sex and masturbation becomes tiring and fails to add any further layers to the story.It is hard to blame Cronenberg, as the execution fits the story. Bleak, detached from emotion, jaded and monotonous fulfils the goal of presenting the lingering disconnect of characters, which are so lost in lack of feeling, whilst trying to discover fulfilment. Especially apparent when Ballard and Catherine have sex - physical pleasure is achieved, but emotional fulfilment is non-achievable. Therefore the search for emotion (one induced by the adrenaline rush of a crash) triggers a longing for more of this natural drug, but at the same time increasing the level required for satisfaction. This self-destructive behaviour is so natural, so human, but achieved through such dehumanised means...A tough piece of fiction, which is hard fought to be called pleasant, but definitely a shocking piece worthy of reflection and afterthought, not necessarily admiration.",Crash

Provocative adaptation of J. G. Ballard's controversial novel has a hypnotically cold allure to it like the best of Kubrick, defined by a sinister compulsion that nearly cripples its compact cast of characters, throbbing with raw, unconventional eroticism not meant to titillate, but fascinate and even repulse. The story is stitched together in abstract terms (notice how Hunter disappears for a large chunk of the movie) and even beyond the questionable authenticity of its paraphilic subject, loses touch with reality a bit too often--were there no repercussions for Spader's involuntary manslaughter? The performances all strike the appropriate note of chilly remoteness; there is no romantic feeling in the various couplings, just the trance of their impulse, as partners are swapped regularly regardless of commitment, correspondence or gender.

The movie pretty much leaves it at that.  I found the sex scenes weren't as cold as some have suggested (although they definitely weren't my bag) and it was good to see something a little bit different from the mainstream, but it was hardly what I'd term a revelatory experience.  Quality actors working with weird material.  Serious fans of the cinema should see it at least once, because whatever else it DOESN'T do, it gets people talking, but it certainly ain't a masterwork...

55,PimpinAinttEasy,Variations of the same sexual fantasy repeated over and over .....,6,19 May 2016,"Dear David Cronenberg, I take my hat off to you for making a movie based on Ballard's Crash. It really pushes the limits of what can be put/shown on film. The film was true to the book. You captured the coldness and in-humaneness of these characters who are lost in their sexual fantasies. But like in the book, it is the same sexual fantasy and its variations repeated over and over again. It did get pretty tedious after a while. Ballard wrote this in the introduction to his book - ""Crash is an extreme metaphor for an extreme situation."" Well, I do spend time at work browsing through pictures of supermodels with whom I would never get to sleep. And I do hold those women up as the ultimate standard of beauty. So that is a bit of an extreme situation as it could lead to disillusionment. I guess this is what Ballard was talking about when he wrote - ""the ultimate role of Crash is cautionary, a warning against that brutal, erotic, and overlit realm that beckons more and more persuasively to us from the margins of the technological landscape."" The actors looked cold, distant and aroused all the time. Best Regards, Pimpin. (6/10)",Crash

57,bob998,Why not watch the movie?,8,13 October 2004,"I don't see people raking Francis Ford Coppola over the coals for making a war film that drastically revised the rules of the genre. In Apocalypse Now he knew he had to re-energize a tradition that had grown stale through endless retelling of Civil War, Pearl Harbor, Midway, D-Day stories. Similarly, the directors who made Bad Company, The Professionals and The Wild Bunch were trying to breathe life into a moribund western tradition: instead of doing John Ford scenes in Monument Valley, they moved the oater in new directions for a new audience.So Cronenberg takes a genre, Science Fiction and Fantasy, that we had feared forever lost to George Lucas and his cutesy robots, and blends it with European-influenced pornography, to the consternation of many (judgeing by the comments below). If you don't want to think about the correlation of orgasm and crash, death and desire, then don't watch Grand Prix, 9/30/55, Days of Thunder, bullfight pictures, etc. etc. For me, there are some lovely scenes in Crash: The James Dean reenactment; the group watching the videos, like the dead in Cocteau's Orphee; the carwash sequence with Spader, Unger and Koteas.",Crash

It's meant as a metaphor for mankind's obsessions and perversions, but the horror is being piled on so thickly that I never once found myself immersed in any of the characters or caring about what happens to them, other than loathing them.

My friend asked me to watch this movie posing the question. I fell in love with the movie not with the idea though.I loved the taking and the bottom line ""to what extent one can go to have a fantasy fulfilled"". The fetish is abnormal and is named paraphilia. I don't know if any body does that in real life or even has such fantasy but David Cronenberg the director seems to be fantasised by such a fetish and made a film out of it. Extraordinary situations demand exemplary acting and thats what we have in here. Cronenberg stands all amidst directors in terms of boldness, bringing surrealism and making us believe that somethings may exist. He just makes me succumb to the believability of his themes and therein lies the greatness of Cronenberg. Now, this film is more like a fantasy fable and even the way it is presented is such. The interesting part comes when this fable seems to be a reality. Yes, paraphilia exists, yes people want to have fun in absurd and weird circumstances and this reality is married with a fable making this a really wonderful film. James Spader seems to be holding a bunch of sex driven films to his credit. Be it ""Sex Lies and Videotape"" or ""Secretary"" and is aptly cast as James Ballard. I do not think, Cronenberg might have been rejected by many other actors, to whom this role was offered. Nevertheless, Spader seemed to be in the right shoes for the role and he has done a commendable job. The film is a challenge coz it marries, the psychology of the brain to the physical desire, a dire necessity of many humans and creates a layered and textured form of a fantasy which is rare and yet so absorbing. David Cronenberg took this challenge from the novel of the same by James Ballard. To write, anyone can write anything, but to make using a publicly accessible medium in a way that it is acceptable is one thing that Cronenberg should be applauded for above all. I stand by this film and admire many things which are extremely challenging and even introspecting and appreciate the courage of the writer-director David Cronenberg. The editing gives us the right dose or romance of romance and action. The cinematography sets the right environment. The music creates the right mood. Now, in such a film what more can you ask for. Thus, I suppose it's one of the most challenging assignments that was accomplished with an aplomb by a director.I thank my friend ""Raghuveer"" who acquainted me with the film and I am happy to have seen this.

A man is in a car crash that kills one of the other passengers, he begins a strange sexual affair with his wife, who also survived the accident. Author JG. Ballard, survived WW2, as documented in Stephen Spielberg's ""Empire Of The Son"", an autobiography of the authors youth, but considers this his most personal work; the main character is named Ballard.Ballard then meets up with a man who is obsessed with re-creating celebrity car crashes, and makes up multiple explanations for his actions which all sound vaugely reasonable, but like The Dark Knight's Joker, all of them are flimsy names for what is basically unexplainable chaotic impulse. Whether he is explaining Crashing as a ""fertilizing rather than a destructive event, mediating the sexuality of those who have died with an intensity that's impossible in any other form."", or discussing the time honored back-seat boogie as ""reshaping of the human body by modern technology,"" its all just ego making excuses for Id.More sex is had, and Ballard's wife, and several other people come into the general swinging mix of things.The performances are emotionally stale even during sex, eternally alienated, everyone's looking for greater and greater kicks, and the story moves like any porn should with escalating extremities building toward climax, but if there is a climax, and I'm not totally sure there is one, it comes a little too late, and doesn't leave us with enough intellectual or emotional denouement.In the end everyone is as automatic and mechanistic as the cars they operate, and are forced to collide in order to create spontaneous human contact, but we get that within the first 30 minutes, so why the additional hour sex? A beautiful body is it's own reward, sex has become meaningless, who cares why not, are all decent enough answers, so you can pick whichever sounds best to you.That being said Cronenberg is as much a masterful director of the body and the human form, here as he was ever, veering between unease, violence, the grotesque, and the arousing eventually into a wreck, but a flaming wreck of a film, that fails, but does so in manner that can generate arguments and interesting thoughts, not a film for everyone, but for the minority interested in literate cinematic porn, there may be something amongst the debris.",Crash

It's not a bad film, because Cronenberg is still a visual master, and some of that comes out, like the scene of the first meeting between Spader and Hunter, where she tries to get her seat belt off, and it's almost like she's aroused.  But the characters here seem like zombies all the way through, and you don't get the sense that they want to feel anything other than dead inside, so it makes no sense that they'd turn to fetish to escape feeling alienated.  The actors all suffer from this, except for Rosanna Arquette as a sort of den mother; she's the only recognizable human here.",Crash

There are no points that you don't want to watch but there are points when you don't want to see.

64,bat-5,Utterly bizarre and empty.,5,20 August 2000,"David Cronenberg likes to push the envelope in film.  With Scanners, he ushered in a new wave of horror.  With The Dead Zone, he gave us horror of a more subdued kind.  With The Fly, he remade a sci-fi classic and gave it a new spin.  And with Dead Ringers, he explored the strange dual life of twins.  With Crash, Cronenberg pushes us, but I don't know what kind of repsonse he was going for.  The story concerns James Ballard and a group of crash enthusiasts.  After his initial crash, Ballard meets up with Helen Remington and a mysterious man named Vaughn. Ballard is soon introduced to the strange world of car crashes, and the rush of sexual tension. Now I can see where there is a thin line that separates these two acts. Both bring out a strong physical and emotional reaction, but the characters in the film are too detached from life. There is sex without pleasure, and the only way these people can experience pleasure, is through the trauma of an automobile accident.  The film moves along at a leisurely pace and nothing ever really happens.  There is no dramatic need that these characters have to fill.  There is no urgency in their actions and their motivations are clouded, by what I interpret as boredom. Cronenberg has done some fine work in the past, and I think he'll come along and shock us with a truly original film.  Until then, stick with the four I mentioned at the top.",Crash

They live in an interesting place, but they do not venture away from it. Instead, they seek out the extreme.I see some people describing this movie as sexy. It's about sex, and the characters in the movie seek out intense intimacy of it, but that doesn't make it sexy.While I appreciate much of what this movie does, the mood of it, the weird, etc., I felt it could have conveyed much of that in half the time.

67,nobbytatoes,car crashes in extreme sexual perversion,7,15 January 2006,"James and his wife Catherine are sexual active, though they have an open relationship, sharing their sexual activities with strangers between one another. One night James loses control of his car and veers into the other lane, smashing head on into the car of Helen, killing her husband. After both have recovered from the accident, though still bearing the physical and emotional scars, they are drawn into a sexual sub-culture of people how relish on sexual stimulation through car crashes. Lead by Vaughan, who recreates famous car crashes of famous celebrities, he believes there is a sexual stimulation that only can be created through crashes, and is better than the real thing. While James is taking this fetish that is heightening his relationship with his wife, who also has been sucked into this, their lives become endangered when Vaughan takes it to far.In the vain of Cronenberg's other film, Naked Lunch, Crashed is based upon J.G. Ballard's book, which you would never believe would be made into a movie. Though Cronenberg once again brings another strange book to life and makes a believable world for these sex addicts. Crash is a very quiet film, there is no much dialog, making this very hard to access. If the people are not having sex in cars or watching car crash porn, they never really converse with one another. While you get some information about these people through their actions, they're to far withdrawn from reality that you can't really connect with them. Yet that seems the entire point.Crash has a surreal dream scape feel to it. Day shots seem stuck in a twilight while the night shots evoke a ghost laden landscape. During Vaughan's reenactment of James Dean car crash, there is something so haunting to it, being heightened from the dream scape feel. It seems the Conenberg wants you to watch these people, yet your not to interact with with, as there is a real distancing presence, making the world these people inhabit very cold.Not a stranger to presenting characters with over confidence and looking to comfortable in his role, James Spader relishes in the role of James. The rest of the cast; Holly Hunter, Deborah Kara Unger, Elias Koteas and Rosanna Arquette all bring mysterious performances. You can never understand their motives or never know what they're thinking, which would have made Spader's role more interesting if he removed that over confidence.In true David Cronenberg fashion, Crash is strange, emotionally distant, perverse and quite a hard and challenging watch.",Crash
68,dr_clarke_2,Crash was once described as a pornographic movie about a fetish that nobody actually has. It's an apt description...,10,9 August 2021,"David Cronenberg's 1996 film version of J. G. Ballard's novel Crash was, at the time, arguably one of the most controversial films ever released. Banned in some parts of the world and shown in theatres with security guards posted outside in others, it prompted moral outrage from certain tabloid newspapers in the UK. Exactly what about the film is so outrageous however is not quite as obvious as it might first appear.Crash, like Ballard's novel, follows film producer James Ballard (named, as in the book, after Ballard himself) and his wife Catherine, as their open relationship takes an unexpected new direction when a road traffic collision leads to an encounter with a certain Dr Robert Vaughan, the unofficial leader of a sort of sex cult of men and women who are turned on by car crashes and the injuries sustained in them. The obvious conclusion that anyone who has never seen the film is that this bizarre premise is the reason for the film's controversy. But the truth is perhaps not that simple. Roger Ebert described Crash as a pornographic movie about a fetish that nobody actually has. It's an apt description and his use of the word ""pornographic"" hints at why the film met with such puritanical outrage.The opening scene is a sex scene, and it is one of many. Crash is probably one of the most sexually explicit ""mainstream"" films released during the nineteen-nineties. And it does at times feel like a porn film. The sex scenes are lingering, gratuitous and exemplified by one between James and Christine during which she asks him a string of questions about Vaughan's cock. The only reason that this scene doesn't look quite like a product of the sex industry is that Peter Suschitzky's cinematography is too impressive. Even Howard Shore's score seems to pay tribute to porn films.And so what we are left with is a film that partly resembles an unusually high-quality skin flick and partly resembles a ""typical"" Ballard dystropian nightmare of a world in which people's (mainly men's) obsession with cars results in high-octane collision being the ultimate aphrodisiac. If Crash is made like a porn movie, then it is made like a porn movie with an unusual number of action sequences, Cronenberg handling the high-speed car chases and crash sequences with enormous technical skill. A hint of what the film - and Ballard's novel - is really about is perhaps provided by Vaughan's line, ""The reshaping of the human body by modern technology."" Does the story, perhaps, suggest that humans can fetishise anything? Or is it more profound, a suggestion that technological development has changed mankind forever? Probably it is neither, since Vaughan later describes this line as a ""crude sci-fi concept"" and says that, actually, it's all about sex.Whatever twisted message - if any - lays buried at the heart of Crash, the film ends up being a fascinating, deeply weird experience that perfect weds the work of Ballard with the body horror aesthetic of many of Cronenberg's previous films to create a disturbing, bold, and occasionally morbidly amusing collision of sex and death. Presented with such bizarre material, the cast members give admirably naturalistic performances, especially James Spader (who has made a career out of playing odd balls and eccentrics) and Holly Hunter as Dr Helen Remington. Elias Koteas is perfectly cast as Dr Robert Vaughan; so convincing is his performance that the audience can believe he truly is aroused by car crashes, and the same is true of Deborah Kara Unger as Catherine. The nature of the film means that it is virtually impossible to empathise or even sympathise with any of the narcissistic characters, all of them entirely obsessed with their own peculiarly niche sexual gratification. But they do manage to be memorably interesting and often weirdly charismatic.In the hands of a lesser director, Crash would have been, as it were, a car-crash of a movie. But Cronenberg - who wrote the screenplay - directs with such precision and skill that it has the all the sterile, clinical beauty of a spotless operating theatre. The concrete freeways of Toronto - Cronenberg's default location for shooting his films - lend themselves well to the stark, dystopian bleakness of Ballard's vision, whilst the make-up and prosthetics are so convincing that a wound that resembles a vagina looks convincingly repulsive rather than absurd. Crash is fascinating but repellent, absurd but never silly: Ballard reportedly thought that the film was better than the book and it is easy to see why. This is one of Cronenberg's most flawless and fascinating pieces of work.",Crash
69,Rockwell_Cronenberg,Cold and fascinating.,9,2 March 2012,"Adapted from J.G. Ballard's novel of the same name, David Cronenberg's Crash has over the past decade and a half become quite the divisive piece for cinephiles and general audiences alike. After watching the NC-17 cut of the film, it's easy to see why, as the film sees the director bringing his intrinsic approach to a particularly unsettling world, an underground subculture of fetishists who equate car wrecks with sexual pleasure. The images aren't particularly shocking, at least not for anyone familiar with his previous work, but they certainly resonate deep in the viewer's mind. He takes a perspective similar to the characters themselves, exploring the automobile as if it were it's own sexual organ.Cronenberg shoots the mechanisms, not only vehicles but medical designs as well, with the same kind of intimacy that a pornographer would shoot the human body. It's an interesting approach, but undeniably one that could alienate any given viewer. Also potentially alienating is the lack of a conventional narrative structure in the film, instead focusing primarily on conversations between the characters and especially their physical interactions. The tone that he establishes here is quite fascinating, giving the whole thing a very cold and distinctly non-intimate atmosphere, where the audience becomes as dazed as the characters are. It's an interesting way of getting us into the head of these characters, but for some viewers it could shut them out early on. If you find it as fascinating as I did though, there's much more to unfold within.In this world of the emotionally blank, Cronenberg explores a culture who aren't interested in the meaningless interactions of daily life, but instead are obsessed with their fetish, their need for sexual release within the design of an automobile. They live in a dangerous world and you can constantly feel the looming presence of some great terror coming closer and closer, thanks in part to the magnificently haunting musical score by Howard Shore that lurks in almost every scene. Cronenberg's cast, featuring skilled actors such as James Spader, Holly Hunter and Elias Koteas, are able to fulfill the director's vision to his maximum intent, bringing a stern believability to their characters and their motivations. It's hard to play these kind of desires, ones that most would not even begin to think of in their daily lives, with the realness that these actors are able to achieve here.What Cronenberg achieves in doing here is something of great skill, a dissection of the American obsession with the automobile as displayed through the use of sexual impulses. It's a fascinating study, and delves into many other themes such as the iconography of the automobile and the relation between the human body and modern technology, a theme that Cronenberg has often explored in his work and yet somehow is always able to bring a new take on it every time he comes back to it. It's a film that can make the viewer want to look away, but somehow manages to hypnotize them in the same instance. There's an almost dream like quality to it, a skill that Cronenberg accomplishes in most of his work. Crash is a film that could easily alienate most viewers, but those who allow Cronenberg to sink in the way he intends are sure to find much fascination in his study.",Crash
70,TheHoodOfSwords,Directionless,5,25 September 2020,"I've seen a lot of weird sex filled/ just plain weird movies. Symbol, Visitor Q, Fifty Shades etc. So the whole ""movie centeted around sex"" aspect isn't something new to me. That being said... this movie is just boring. I expected it to be about the real aftermath and destruction car crashes cause but it was mostly just a lot of having sex in a car. Which goes against the ""appeal"" the characters seem to have which is the danger and carnage that car crashes cause.The movie also has no sense of direction. It's just people having sex. There's no purpose to anything you're being shown and yet they decide to linger on everything for so long it all just feels painfully slow. Everyone talks in a whisper so you can't hear them. The start is confusing for no reason. By the time you realize what you're watching is just boring you'll probably be half way through and like me just decide whatever I'll finish it.Skip it, if you want a sex movie that focuses on weirdness but has more of an underlining purpose and message watch Visitor Q.

71,smakawhat,Crunch,5,30 April 2000,"Sex and car crashes and lots of them.  Both.  What can I say...  where do I start...James Spaders character gets into a car accident one day and ends up meeting a select group of individuals who get erotic stimulation from car crashes.  This group of people is headed by a guy who his wife finds intensely charismatic.  He recreates historic crashes like the one that killed James Dean, with himself in the car.  His 1963 Lincoln he says has been crashed so many times and he restores it just to get it running cause he doesn't want to give it up, and he wants to crash it again.  He takes photos of accident scenes and is obsessed.With this obsession, involves a lot of sex.  And EVERY avenue is explored. Heterosexual, lesbian, homosexual etc..  I would consider this film to be more of an experiment in an idea than a story about people.  Cronenberg makes you believe that there is a lot of similarity in comparing a car crash and people's fascination with the automobile and sexual desire.  The actors are excellent, the concept Bizarre, the look of the film is great.  Is it a masterpiece?  Hell no.The only thing I really liked in the film was the music score which had this guitar arpegiation which sounded really cool.  Also it played during the opening credits which were real neat.  I am not a fan of Croneneberg but, with all the good and bad I guess I remained neutral about it.

72,barberoux,Engaging but very odd and disturbing.,7,29 April 2003,"""Crash"" was an odd, disturbing movie.  A NC17 and R rated version were on the DVD.  Who is going to not watch the R version.  If you're too delicate to watch the R version what are you doing watching this movie in the first place.  Anyway, I'm still not sure if I liked this movie or not.  The characters were not in the least appealing but I think the movie's premise touched on a bit of a morbid, sensational appeal that is part of most people's personality.  Maybe I feel a bit of guilt because part of me enjoyed this movie and part was turned off by the hedonistic, nihilistic personalities portrayed.  I try to believe in an overall goodness in society but recognize I am involved in gaper delays.  There were good performances in the movie by James Spader and Holly Hunter.  Elias Koteus was really creepy.  Deborah Unger and Rosanna Arquette were there for their physical appeal.  They did a good job.  The Holly Hunter character kind of disappeared halfway through the movie.  I think that is one criticism I can make about the movie.  The characters were not as important as the sensational story. (Maybe a SPOILER could be derived from the following.) James Spader's and Deborah Unger's marriage was portrayed as a wreck.  Their need for external stimulus drove them to more and more extreme measures to get excited.  Their lives would end in tragedy sooner on later and that was how the movie ended.  It was not an uplifting end.  (SPOILER warning defunct.)  Overall this was not a happy movie and its character depiction was disturbing but it touched on a morbid aspect of one's personality.",Crash

74,asifahsankhan,"Crash is a ""Fertilizing"" rather than a ""Destructive"" event...",8,5 February 2017,"To put it mildly, Crash is a movie that you can either accept or you can't. You are either able to see beyond the trappings presented on the outside, or all you see is the outside. I'm not going to say that you either get it or you don't, because that would be wrong. However, Crash is a film that has been polarising since it was screened for the first time. With that comes a certain idea of what the film is, and all I can say is that the people who take the negative view on Crash are selling the creative mind of David Cronenberg criminally short.If you heard that Crash is all about sex and car crashes, then you heard correctly, but you also heard wrong. The sex and the car crashes are windows into the true story that Cronenberg wants to tell. The ideas he wants to examine are laid out for the viewer through the sex and car crashes. To look at the sex and see only sex, or to look at the car crashes and see only car crashes is to deny what is under the surface of the entire film.What is under the surface you ask, emotion and what it means to us is the simplest answer. That's the problem with this review, I'm doing my best to keep this review and not be long winded. Crash doesn't make that easy, it is a complex and thought provoking film, the type that I could write about for paragraph after paragraph. I am fighting the impulse to break the film down in a massively thorough style, but at the same time I hope that by holding myself back I'm not giving the movie the short end of the stick.Okay, that slight case of being sidetracked is behind me, let's get back to the point at hand. Crash is about emotion, the emotion that we experience in our everyday lives. Sex is nothing but heightened emotion, and on that note so are violent acts, death, and so on. Sex is a deeply emotional and personal act, but that doesn't mean it is an act that is individualistic. We get a charge out of sex because it involves more than just ourselves, the same is true of violence. There is an animal power in both, an animal power driven by the emotions and the people present. Crash asks a few simple questions, where do we draw the line on acceptability and should there be any line?Cronenberg directs Crash so that it is dripping with sex. What he does with atmosphere is brilliant. There are moments when the movie isn't sexual in any way, but he has so ingrained sex into the atmosphere that the audience begins to ascribe sexual connotations to every moment of the film. If, as we try to tell ourselves on a daily basis, sex doesn't dominate our lives then why do we so easily view non-sexual scenes as sexual? The camera also fluctuates, at times Cronenberg lets the camera play the role of an observant stalker. At other times he unleashes the camera like a predator on the hunt. The camera ends up leering and slinking about just as much as it is on its hind legs ready to strike. This creates an interesting quandary for the viewer. We are left without steady footing, Cronenberg is constantly jostling us around, never giving the viewer a moment to think they are safe and actually understand what is going on or what will happen next.Fighting the urge to go more in-depth with my analysis is very hard, to counter that impulse I'm going to try and touch on a few more things and then call it a day.There is a connection between sex, cars and violence. In real life this connection rarely, if ever, happens at the same time. There are people who jones for sex, violence, violent sex, cars, violent car crashes or sex in a car. Crash is very real in some aspects, but it doesn't concern itself with staying real or honest. Cronenberg isn't interested in exploring what real connections may exist between sex, violence and cars. Rather, he is interested in exploring what those three say about humanity when they are heightened to the next stage in their evolution.The last thing I'd like to touch on is the acting in Crash. It would be very easy to watch Crash and come away thinking that the cast doesn't bother to do much. That couldn't be further from the truth, and I dare say that I have seen very few performances that match that of Elias Koteas as Vaughan. He is a haunted man, but he's an intelligent man, a man who can't be figured out and doesn't stop to allow the audience to understand him at all. Koteas may be the highlight acting wise, but the rest of the cast delivers as well. Deborah Kara Unger is icy cool, monotone at every second, but her brain is always working. She isn't dull, she functions on a higher level, dissecting all her experiences beneath her stoic exterior. Holly Hunter is the true thrill seeker of the bunch, always looking for her next fix, the where and the how doesn't matter, her character trembles in anticipation of the next ""act."" James Spader is aloof, and maybe that is just the character Spader plays in every role, but it fits perfectly in Crash. Lastly there is Rosanna Arquette's Gabriella, who enjoys her handicap. She views it a badge of honour and as an exhilarating way to explore more of her sexuality. I'm not saying for a second that you have to like any of their characters, but the performances behind those characters leave a lot to like.",Crash

You kind of get pulled in and you just want to know what happens next.  The plot seems kind of thin but the director works wonders with it.I would not recommend this for the normal viewer of movies.  This is for someone who is looking for something new and does not mind the disturbing images of sexuality and violence depicted in the film.I still give this 4 out of 5 stars for originality.PS Makes sure you rent the NC-17 rated version.

Their sexual turn-on is car wrecks, and they cause them when they can't find them by chance. This movie, directed by David Cronenberg, is based on a novel by J. G. Ballard.This is a disturbing film. The sex scenes approach soft core porn, as the characters paw and grope each other, and there is rampant fetishism as well. However, I was unable to care about the characters. Casting James Spader as the lead guarantees a performance of flat affect. This sometimes works (as in ""sex, lies, and videotape,"" when he plays a weird voyeur), but when he is the main character and I can't begin to like him or feel sympathy for him, it wrecks the movie for me.The problem with the film from my point of view is that I'm never given any reason to identify with these people and to care about their drive for this particular form of fetishism. I suspect the sex aspect of the film was too difficult for the director and/or the actors (including Holly Hunter, Elias Koteas, and Deborah Kara Unger) for them to develop their roles fully. Instead of some fascinating insight into a world I'd never heard of, I saw moments of soft core sex interspersed with dialog from affectless characters about whom I learned nothing.",Crash

James Spader, Holly Hunter, Rosanna Arquette and Elias Koteas give pretty good performances. the film is basically set on these odd people that make a club and in this club they watch very harsh car crashes on the TV while either having sex or masturbating to it. as i said the film is very disturbing and i think this is probably the most controversial film ever made. i do think director David Cronenberg always tries to have something extreme in his film. if its not sex its hard hitting violence or something really strange. this film is definitely aimed at the Cronenberg fans due to its strange going ons. i'm not really a fan of Cronenberg's work but if i had to choose a favourite i'd pick A History Of Violence.this is a good film that is very original even over 10 years later this film has not been repeated so it should be watched by people who want to watch something different. even though the sex is really over the top it is a interesting look into the fetish's of something very strange. not brilliant but definitely worth a look.............. 6.5..............j.d Seaton",Crash

And I think the icy detachment of the film's style encourages that viewpoint for a lot of people. It's a clinical look at human sexuality, shot with all the clear, sharp focus you'd need to film an autopsy.There is a lot of humor in this film, but it's always mixed in with tension--usually an uneasy apprehension about an impending crash. You want to laugh because it's absurd, but you keep quiet because Cronenberg has forced you to be a voyeur watching some of the deepest, darkest sex fetishes people could possibly have. It's a made-up world, of course, but the rampant realism makes it seem deadly serious. But it's not.And the James Spader / Elias Koteas kiss is the hottest male/male kiss in all of cinema.",Crash

85,C22Man,Equally Disturbing and Fascinating,9,9 March 2016,"David Cronenberg is known for his disturbing mixture of psychological and body horror, his films are always slickly made but with a real seediness to them that actually gives them a unique edge. For all of his work however Crash is the film that most people think crossed the line because it is simply too sordid and repulsive, causing massive controversy on release and still carrying infamy the this day. The fact its based on the novel by JG Ballard (whose work is always deeply unsettling) should give you a clue about the films nature. I think the film is very gripping, not just because it is extremely well made and acted, but because the ideas behind the film are a lot smarter than most give it credit for. Firstly the biggest issue people have with the film which is the plot. It is effectively about people who are turned on by car crashes or the thoughts of being in a car crash. A young TV director named James Ballard gets involved with a group of people into this form of fetishism when he himself has a car crash. I will admit that the premise is very far out there and yes Crash is very disturbing at times, but its no more as troubling in a graphic sense than most films based around sexuality and I think people are more troubled with the idea itself that the film. The sex scenes are extremely graphic and unnerving, the scene with the scar tissue is downright horrible, but I think that they do work given the context of the film.Then you have to look at what the film is trying to say. Cronenberg's works (and Ballard's) have always had links to the loss of human feeling because of the technological world we live in and that plays a large role here. The film is certainly a comment on the human condition, how people have become so empty that the only way to feel intimate is to risk ones life doing something so dangerous. Many of these very simple ideas work fantastically, the fact that something as everyday as the car plays such an important role or that the fetishes of these people are something completely out of the ordinary. There is also the way in which the car is used to stalk people and used for sexual fantasies that links into this clever idea. I also don't understand the anger towards the more graphic areas. Violence, sex and drugs are put together frequently in films with little fuss made, yet add something different to the mix and people lose their minds. If you swapped out car crashes for heroin or cocaine addiction then nobody would even bat an eyelid. I think the cast deserve a massive amount of praise given some of the stuff they have to do. For me James Spader has always been a very interesting actor and here he is very effective in a brilliantly understated performance as Ballard. Deborah Kara Unger is also excellent as his wife, between this and The Game she really deserved more starring roles, and her chemistry with Spader is surprisingly believable. The groups de-facto leader Vaughn is excellently played by Elias Koteas, especially given the difficult borderline nature of the character. The always great Holly Hunter and Rosanna Arquette give solid supporting performances too. The characters here are extremely distant and cold, which understandably turns off many, but they are made that way to reflect the story and not because of a lack of character development.One area where the film truly excels in is with Howard Shore's score. This is easily one of the most atmospheric and haunting scores of its time, fitting the film so perfectly it is hard to believe. The opening title song is just incredible, the jagged dissonant guitar is so powerful and is used to underpin the score throughout. The film looks fantastic. The colour scheme is impressive, with the daytime scenes having a mechanical grey look that adds to the dullness of the world and the night scenes having an icy sheen that gives them a strange beauty. The car crashes themselves are very well done and look like you'd expect real car crashes too. There are many memorable moments littered throughout, the car wash scene is very well shot and the cryptic ending is actually quite profound.So for me Crash is a film that gets unfairly hated on, mostly because its premise is daring and very out of the ordinary. It is frequently disturbing and at times bordering on repulsive, but it carries itself in such an unflinching manner and with such great ideas that you understand why. Its comments on the world are deceptively brilliant, whilst I think to acting and score are both superb. Cronenberg shows himself as a truly talented director once again, as he knows from the very start what he want to achieve and everything that takes place leaves an impact because of that. It is a film that is difficult to like, but one that almost has to be admired.",Crash
86,MooCowMo,Buckle Yer Seatbelts... :=8/,6,1 February 2000,"Odd, subversive little film from Canada's weird David Cronenberg(""Videodrome"", ""Scanners"", ""Naked Lunch""), proving that he is slowly but surely becoming moore and moore strange as time goes on.  Basically, this film is about a bunch of perverts who become erotically charged by automobile crashes, especially famous or personal ones.  James Spader(""Sex and Lies on Videotape""), and his wife Deborah Unger(""Payback""), who were preeverts before, are taken udder the wing of an even larger preevert, played by Elias Koteas(""Prophecy""), his mangled girlfriend(Roseanne Arquette, ""Desperately Seeking Susan""), and a twisted accident victim/doctor(Holly Hunter, ""The Piano"").  They re-enact famous death crashes, like James Dean's, run each other off the road with gleeful abandon, and have sex with each other almoost incessantly.  Because everyone involved is such a preevert, it's tough to identify with any single character; Cronenberg seems to be saying that there is a little Freudian preevert inside all of us, just awaiting the right stimuli to come along and flick the sickie switch, but it's hard to imagine the cownection here between erotic stimuli and car crashes.  For one, this MooCow can only associate car crashes with insurance headaches. :=8P  Nothing like a night's rent watching cheap, ugly, disturbing sex.

88,Don-102,How does one make such an awful film ?,1,19 February 1999,"David Cronenberg's CRASH is one of the worst pieces of cinematic trash I have ever witnessed.  I give an enormous amount of credit to some of the cast members (Holly Hunter, especially) for participating in such crap.  She obviously saw something erotic or dangerous in the script.  I saw idiocy, stupidity, and unnecessary pain.  I did not know whether to laugh or vomit, but I somehow made it through.The film involves an over-sexed James Spader, who 'crashes' into a car with a half-naked Ms. Hunter, killing the driver, and seriously injuring Spader's leg.  In the hospital, the film's forced sexuality never stops, considering a visit Spader gets from a handy blonde.  Through a series of weird events and experiences involving automobiles I would rather not get into, the film's self-important message is clear: How modern technology changes the human body i.e. car crashes.First of all, we've been presented this message in countless other ways. Cronenberg has just found a sick and explicit way to present it.  Secondly, what these characters think and do exist only to 'present' this overblown message.  They have no other duties, ideas, character traits, or appeal other than to go wild sexually in all kinds of cars, car washes, and car chases.  What is this?  Neo-Industrial Revolutionary filmmaking?  No, it is garbage.One-note:  Rosanna Arquette appears as a good-looking Darth Vader.  Only anyone who has seen this will know what I mean. This is in no way a recommendation, and this has been a fun waste of time discussing bad cinema.",Crash
89,wchngliu,"And The Moral Of This Story Is? Oh, I Forgot, There Isn't One",2,30 June 2007,"The tag-line of this movie reads: 'The Most Controversial Film You Will Ever See'. Well, not only was it controversial to the extent to which it was subsequently banned in cinemas throughout the UK 11 years ago, but the narrative and plot of the film was as ridiculous as it was distasteful. The idea of people getting turned on by car crashes didn't just sound stupid and lame but also sick. I for one am not the reader of the English newspaper the Daily Mail. I am not even middle class myself and so therefore, my views on this film in no way are based on or influenced by some tabloid press but rather from a personal point of view. Thus, what I dislike most about Crash however is that it has a stupid and inane premise and the fact that it was such a terrible film in itself.The plot of Crash revolved around a couple whose husband played by Spader ends up paralysed in a car accident. Of course this doesn't stop him and his wife from doing it with each other and even with other people. Spader's character has him having sex with Holly Hunter, in addition to this he even has a homo-erotic encounter with a guy (not that I have anything against homosexuality whatsoever that is). In fact, one of the main problems with Crash is the rather daft plot- its all about sex, sex and sustaining injuries and losing control of their libido by dangerous driving and that its all done in a cheap, tacky, demoralising and distasteful manner. When they have sex, they don't do it out of love for the other person but rather out of sexual arousal, out of desperation and out of weakness. They couldn't really give a toss about the other person's feelings, or the people they hurt. If anything those characters in Crash come across as being selfish, as well as perverse.Another problem is the actual point of this film- what message is this trying to evoke to its audience? What can the audience themselves take away from this viewing experience? And is there a point to all this? The answers to those questions can only be answered by those able enough to come up with meaningful answers. But unfortunately, they have not been addressed or tackled whatsoever within this movie.I failed to see how I could empathise with or feel remorse for the main characters. In fact, I utterly despised watching this film, that I was thinking as I was seeing the events take place, 'What the hell was that?'. I'm sorry but getting aroused at the expense of others and endangering others by getting involved in car collisions doesn't make for a good movie. It looked so tacky and on screen, the scenes would've offended those of whom were lucky enough to survive a car accident or two.There isn't really a moral to this silly story because let's face it, with a complex and controversial subject such as sex, in Crash with car accidents and people having sex with each other and other people, how on earth can there be one, for sure? David Croenberg has come up with some very strange concepts for films- hell, we often watch scenes in TV sitcoms and dramas for instance where the character is a novice at driving the car, or is attempting to drive the car and the other guy says something like 'imagine that this car is a woman and you're in a relationship with her/it' or some silly crap such as that. However, this one takes the biscuit as it has become a step too far. Crash was a terrible waste of a film and in Spader, Hunter and Arquette- of whom are three undeniably good actors, their talents were virtually unseen in this so-called diabolical 'porn' fest. For me, it was a nonsensical piece of garbage.",Crash

Therefore I think Crash is a very important movie, and it moved me, even if I´m not entirely satisfied with it as a whole. It has however managed to stay in my mind, and turned me on to the rest of JG Ballards fiction, of whom I am now a great fan and recommend to everyone. This is a very ambitious attempt to bring his vision to the screen and perhaps I´ve seen too much movies, but I can´t help but think that David could have gone a little bit further.

91,Scoopy,Illustrates the fine line between genius and insanity.,8,3 May 1999,"Many people gave this film a low rating because they hated it. I can understand hating it. It wants your hate, just as Andy Kaufmann wanted your hate when he played his most despicable characters. I can't understand giving it a low rating. It may be detestable, but it's a good piece of filmmaking.David Cronenberg is a filmmaker who requires a great deal of intellectual participation from the viewer. When you watch his movies, you can either sit there and say ""God, this is stupid"", or you can take up his challenge. ""Crash"" is a good movie if you just accept one thing. It doesn't take place in our universe, but in a parallel one where the connection between cars and sex is far more explicit. Auto-eroticism has a different meaning in that universe, and the darker side of this fetish involves automobile accidents, which really turn some people on.James Spader is in a distant marriage which seems barely held together by the two of them having affairs and turning each other on with the descriptions of their outside liaisons. When Spader has an automobile accident, he finds that his wounds and breaks have become erotic objects for his wife and others. This widens his interests to a cult of accident survivors who obsess about their scars and braces, about famous crashes and cars, etc. For light entertainment, they all watch public safety films, and masturbate over the crash dummies. As you can imagine, they turn rubbernecking into a science, and pore through accident sites feeling the hot metal, tasting the blood, and photographing the aftermath. Since they live in an alternate universe, police and paramedics and firefighters simply ignore them.Cronenberg uses this imaginary universe to explore some facets of our own:* the replacement of humans by machines, in this case symbolized by Rosanna Arquette and her mechanized body which is barely distinguishable from the car Spader mounts her in. Is he inflamed by her braces or the transmission?* flirting with death as a sexual stimulus (it's no coincidence that Cronenberg also directed Burroughs' Naked Lunch, since that novel is about the death-wish as much as anything else)* the impact of sexual obsession on other facets of life* the contrapositive impact of shared non-sexual obsessions on sexual attraction. Once people are drawn into this cult, they want to rut with everyone else in it, same sex or not. The obsession transcends all other considerations. It's no coincidence that they mention the Kennedy assassination. That obsession is the perfect match in our world.
Is Cronenberg a looney tune? Absolutely. Is he brilliant? Absolutely. He illustrates perfectly the fine line between genius and madness. The movie is well performed, masterfully photographed, sustains its mood perfectly, and is an aesthetically pleasing replication of its own cold-steel emotionless Bizarro world. There is no love or warmth in this world, only obsession and stimulus. There are no children or kittens, or anything else which might soften the hearts of the denizens. This movie is like Andy Kaufmann's comedy: it never winks and comes out of character and tells you everything is OK. It wants you to hate it, because if it is authentic you should hate everything about it, if you are a normal person. This film might repulse you, but you can't deny its imaginative power.",Crash
92,CinefanR,"Strange, Stylish, Fascinating",10,17 April 2013,"One of the great qualities of this film is the ability to constantly astonish with its relentless, shocking strangeness. ""Crash"" is most likely to leave viewers speechless, even those who are used to ""weird"" or unconventional. None of the scenes are gratuitous however, and ""Crash"" looks extremely stylish, as well as twisted enough to make one uneasy. Fortunately, this isn't 'cheap shocks' and the usual exploitation fare filmmakers throw in to stir some ""controversy"".Perverted addicts leading corrupt lives never been more fascinating. These people are craving some basic fulfillment, but are doomed to never achieve it in life. Metaphysical allegory? Probably. It's also a cold analysis of self-destructive compulsion. What's offensive is that these characters never even stop to consider the moral implications of their actions - hurting others who don't share their ""hobby"". Even if they did, it wouldn't make much of a difference, because they simply can't stop. Like Lynch, Cronenberg doesn't spoon-feed the ""message"" to the audience, so there are no answers, only uncomfortable but equally valid questions. I guess it takes guts to ask them. Dialogue is minimal and clever, and keeps the characters sealed. The narrative is filled with long pauses, eerie metallic riffs, empty glances directed inwards. Physical encounters are depersonalized and compulsive. There are always people around at the scene of sexual encounters or car crashes, and yet nobody bothers to notice or intervene. It's a surreal landscape of urban alienation that associates with voyeurism. Steel-cold (the unsettling score hits the right note as well), clinical in its depictions, ""Crash"" has a clean sharp edge that only a handful of directors could walk on with such elegance, insight and a sort of detachment that has a dream-like quality.All the actors are fearless and did a splendid job, especially James Spader, who is great as usual. He was born to play this role, with his other-worldly, strangely absent stare and androgynous beauty (It's surprising David Lynch never worked with him!). Spader's surreal performance is mind-blowing, as he gracefully carries along that creepy Cronenberg vibe. This is the same Spader who stole the show as the intriguing voyeur in ""Sex, Lies and Videotape"" and who would later do it again in the offbeat ""Secretary"". His other roles just didn't do justice to him. Likewise, Deborah Unger manages to turn into an abstraction, whispering her lines, floating in the same trance of addiction.The sexual scenes are elegantly choreographed. It's bizarre, disturbing and at times funny altogether, with a pretty sick sense of humor that's absolutely fantastic to a minority of people who can appreciate it. ""Crash"" explores sexual compulsion in a sterile environment, you can almost taste the metal. This is Cronenberg's best work and one of the most fascinating, audacious films ever made. Clearly not for everybody, but for those who enjoy the Absurd in all its complexity. Unforgettable cult classic to be watched in the uncut version.",Crash

When Spader has one(in quite a disturbing and violent scene), he kills a woman's husband, then proceeds to have an affair with the widow.)  Subsequently, the rest of the film deals with a local group of fellow fetishists, led by the creepy Elias Koteas, and Spader's involvement with them.The film is filled to the brink with sex, both heterosexual and homosexual. There are scenes that will absolutely give you the proverbial chills.SPOILEROne scene in particular which I cannot get out of my head is the entire group of car crash fetishists siting in Koteas' apartment, all watching car test dummy footage, and feeling each other's genitals, treating the footage as pornography.  The ending, also, has got to be one of the most audience-recoiling ever shot.After watching this film, it left me rather hollow and vexed and continued to disturb me throughout the weekend and the next few days.

DePalma might have made this into a campy romp of sorts; however, the detachment is so great from the audience and from anything that i was hoping they'd get into a fatal accident in the first 20 minutes of the film or so. Oh, the dialogue is also pretty awful.",Crash
99,brdlybaum,You HAVE to see this film!,10,2 July 2006,"It is perhaps one of THE greatest misconstrued films of all time! For anyone to give it less than 7 or 8 out of ten is criminal and they have surely missed the whole point of the film! Because of my love of all things directed by David Cronenberg (quite possibly THE greatest director to have never been truly recognised in terms of awards gained for the work that he has done and continues to do) I gave the film a resounding 10 out of 10! The camera work is absolutely amazing and is done so beautifully it draws you along and into what is being shot perfectly. You end up feeling EXACTLY what David Cameron is wanting you to. Feeling that is also helped by the superb acting of the cast, main and support. They took to the film like a duck to water and bring out the best of the wonderfully written script. This film never over-states anything without reason and in general it subtly under-states and your mind is almost playing catch-up as are your thoughts. This is not a bad thing and you don't actually realise it is happening as it is exceedingly subtle but it all adds to the wonderment of the film. The film is about a man that almost loses his wife in a car crash after he is pulled out of a nasty one (that is a head on collision) barely alive and it is whilst recuperating in hospital that things get stranger for James Ballard. His sex life already empty with his wife, and in search of new ways to put the excitement back in it he meets the other driver, the driver that caused the head on collision by driving straight towards him on the wrong side of the road, and she convinces him to attend one of her meetings with her. From there on things for James Ballard get very strange indeed as he thinks there could be something in the principles behind the meetings and in what the meetings are all about- finding the connection between sex and danger and the closer to death one can get the more exciting things can become and the more sexually turned on one gets. It's a bit like the way some people get really turned on by and gain huge orgasms from the intensity of being strangled during sex because the closer they get to having all of their breath squeezed out of them the bigger their orgasms are. well in this film substitute having one's neck squeezed (strangulation/asphixiation) for car crashes. After visiting the group a couple of times and thinking they can help James gets his wife involved. Where once the other members in the group also led empty passionless sex lives James can see they don't now, the only problem is one of increased severity; they realise that little accidents don't turn them on like they used to. It gets to the point where bigger and bigger and nastier and nastier crashes are needed all the time to get turned on. This doesn't just relate to strangulation, it relates to bondage as well in that if one only need 6 of the best with say, a ruler to get turned on, sometime soon one will get numb to that and need more. Either more strokes with the ruler or 6 with something heavier or both.This is a must-see film of the highest order and all those that don't rate this film 7 or 8 out of ten or higher well they have completely missed the point. I didn't want to spend to much time on it as I didn't want to ruin your enjoyment of this masterpiece!",Crash
100,crazyrabbits,This film is not going places...,2,11 June 2006,"I have not read the book version of this film that was written by author J.G. Ballard, nor do I want to read it, after watching the debacle that is this film. When people tell you to read the novel the movie is based on, then the film has failed in telling you the whole story.I will now attempt to explain the plot of this film: we first start with a woman (played very blandly by Deborah Kara Unger) having sex with a man in an airport hanger. Then we see her husband (played by James Spader) having sex with his secretary. Oh yeah, and then we see them having sex at home.Conclusions: These people must really like to have sex.Then, Spader's character gets into a car accident with a half-naked woman (played by Holly Hunter) and some other guy who gets killed, so he takes to also having sex with her on a regular basis. Oh yeah, and then they meet this guy named Vaughan (played by Elias Koteas) who hires Spader's character to drive him around so he can look for woman and have sex with them in the backseat while Spader's character cruises along under Highway 401.Conclusions: These people must really like to have sex.In addition to these people, we also find out that Vaughan really likes performing re-creations of famous car crashes. His friend (I forget what his name is) ends up getting killed in an auto accident while dressed up like Jayne Mansfield. There is also a woman (played by Rosanna Arquette) who seems to have trouble walking, and she has a giant gash on her leg, which Spader's character proceeds to have sex with at one point. Oh, and every member of the cast has sex with everyone else at one point or another in the film.Conclusions: ???Needless to say, the premise for the film is very shallow and very stupid. All of the characters act in silly and immature ways, including sleeping with each other's spouses, a man chasing after a couple on a busy highway (and subsequently getting killed after going off the guardrail), and reckless endangerment of themselves and other civilians.What's probably the worst thing about this film is how it utterly fails to deliver on the promise of the ""crash"" culture. We see that these few characters like to have car accidents and have sex in wrecked cars, but is there anyone else who is doing the same thing? Yes, there are some people at the event where Vaughan recreates the James Dean crash, but for all we know, these people are just passive observers who have nothing better to do. As a result, the main characters look like total car fetish freaks.Bottom Line: I'm sorry, this film is terrible. It's completely worthless, has terrible acting, a foolish concept, a ridiculous plot, AND the way it ends is stupid as well. I give this film a 2 out of 10, because it's David Cronenberg.",Crash
101,Doogie D,well-crafted but pointless,2,10 March 1999,"Cronenberg is an artist, but the sure-footed work done here does not mitigate the disaster.  Not only is the subject matter specialized to the point of obscurity (or maybe just indifference), the pointless mess reaches an ineffective non-conclusion.  Unsatisfying in nearly every way; some enjoyment in the cinematography, a bit less in the music and photographic composition (though, to be fair, I saw this on video). Awful.",Crash
102,BlackBalloon,Worthwhile for Cronenberg and Ballard fans,7,23 August 2001,"This was my favorite movie for a long time.  Cronenberg was my favorite director at the time and despite the film's tastelessness and utter lack of appeal, there was a certain beauty to the execution that I found compelling. I found it a relaxing experience to put this movie on- I have probably watched it at least 50 times.  You get to know a movie pretty well in the course of that many viewings.  At a certain point, the tone of the movie seems almost humorous in its unrelenting lack of emotion and expression.  In a strange way, for me, it became about the very things it seems to oppose. Crash made me appreciate the liveliness of almost any life in comparison to the characters in this film.  By being devoid of even the slightest expression, the film highlights the possibility of expression and life in things one might not normally notice.  Cronenberg has said that Crash is about people who have had all the previous contexts of their life yanked out from under them and have to willfully re-assign meaning to everything.  It seems that these people's lives are so empty otherwise that car crashes and sex are enough to cause this.  They're not merely looking for depth of feeling, they're looking for meaning and truth in anything.  It's a given that, metaphorically, Crash touches on these themes in a broader sense (see Ballard's introduction to the French edition of the book), but a film so burdened with existential issues can very rarely have a point sharper than its atmosphere.  See also Natural Born Killers.",Crash
103,BlackBalloon,People try to read too much into this movie,7,15 October 2002,"The one thing I notice looking at many of the comments is that people look for too much ""meaning"" in this movie.  Haven't they ever read an interview with Cronenberg and know that he is completely apolitical?  Or seen his early student work and know that he is not exactly long on plausability (for those who complain about that)?  This movie is meant to be an experience, however you take it.  Do not think about it, let it wash over you and make you mad, make you bored, make you aroused, whatever.  Just don't think about it.  ""Too much brains, not enough guts"", like in Cronenberg's Shivers. Adhering to his philosophy of art, Cronenberg is a pure artist, not allowing social concerns or conventions to enter into the equation.  He simply puts his vision out there and lets it speak for itself, and when he does speak of his art, he always specifies ""I think..""  The truth may be different.",Crash
104,AdFin,This film says nothing,4,16 December 2001,"So this is it, the Most Dangerous film ever made (Quoted from British News Paper The Daily Mail), this is the film that has enough power to shake the world to its foundation. We'll I'm sorry but for me I found the film to be slow, pretentious and devoid of any real message at all. There are people who have reviewed this film saying how it's a strong look at sexual perversion, a film that isn't afraid to take the viewer deep into the character's psyche and make the viewer confront their own sexual fears. Well once again I'm sorry, but all Crash showed me was that perhaps there are a small group of idiots out there who are so wrapped up in auto-erotica, that the final stage is to actually crash you're car, and the immediately have sex. Maybe I've missed the point (if the film has a point at all) and if you think I have then feel free to point it out to me, but as far as I can see Crash is as dangerous as an episode of Lamb Chop (and nowhere near as intelligent). David Cronenberg has always struck me of as an interesting film maker, but also a film maker of limited vocabulary, he seems to take great pleasure in recycling the same notion of man's metamorphosis with machine that began with his eighties classic Videodrome. He says nothing new here, but does prove he has an interesting take on filming the proceedings. The film looks great, with a very cold and detached atmosphere, and a production design of predominant cool blues, but he has no idea what he's talking about with the story. The acting is below par, the actors (Deborah Kara Unger springs immediately to mind) give very pretentious performances, but what else could they give trying to blurt out Cronenberg's terrible conceited dialog. Another thing about this film is that every single woman in the cast appears in some stage of undress at some point in the film, with Unger and Holly Hunter providing full-frontal shots, what with the camera lingering slowly over the shiny metal of a sleek sports car, then dissolving to a pair of naked breasts it's clear that Cronenberg is trying to market this film solely to upper-middle class high earning males with too much time on their hands. Crash is not a dangerous film, nor is it a complete waste of time, It's nothing more than a below average film that provides nothing more than pretentious (there's that word again) fodder for would be intellectuals or some disturbing kind of ""thinking man's porn"". 4/10",Crash

106,tritisan,Analytic Erotic,8,8 July 1999,"When watching Cronenberg's films, I always feel as though I am looking into a fishbowl at a world that is, thankfully, not my own. An alternate universe. Unlike Lynch's works, which pull you into a sick and twisted underworld that feels all-too-real, Crash and Naked Lunch invite you to watch and examine human behavior from a cool, analytical standpoint.That's why his characters, especially in Crash, tend to show so little 'acting'. They are not asking you to identify with their weird fetishes, morals or motivations. I think this is why so many people are confused and lost or bored when confronting Crash. We have been so conditioned by narrative cinema to expect to be drawn into the film, to identify with the hero and expect a certain plot to shape up, ending with a climax. Crash is not about this.We've also come to expect sex and violence to be depicted in a certain way. Somehow, it's become perfectly acceptable for the hero to brutally kill many people. Blood and gore are commonplace. But how often have you seen normal, healthy sex depicted in an erotic (not pornographic) way?My point is that Crash and its world and David Cronenberg are not normal, nor are they trying to be. They are true to themselves, internally consistent. And that's why I think they are so great.",Crash
107,Ursula_Two_Point_Seven_T,Just plain bad,1,19 September 2006,"Either this is the dumbest movie ever, or I am. I totally didn't get it. Everyone in this movie was more interested in their genitals than anything else - it's like they had no life outside of finding people to have sex with. And the sex was gross (IMO). Was this supposed to be sexy or provocative???? I'm no prude, but to me it wasn't. Holly Hunter has sex with the guy (James Spader) who killed her husband in a car crash shortly after they both get out of the hospital???? HUH??? It's just sex, car crashes, sex, car crashes, sex, scars, sex, lather, rinse, repeat. And the ending???? Dumb beyond belief! It's like everyone in this movie was a walking penis or vagina, and all they cared about was getting their rocks off. Even when your beloved wife lays possibly dying underneath a car, your first (only) instinct is to f*** her??? WTF! DVD features (New Line Cinema DVD): You can watch either the NC-17 version or the R version. I watched the NC-17 version at 1 hr 40 min. I can't imagine what the R version was like. If they took out all the explicit sex scenes from the NC-17 version, I'd imagine the R version would be all of 7 minutes or so! ""Extras"" consist of scene selection, language selection, and on-screen static text mini bios of the primary actors. Borrrrring! Oh, so why did I rent this? I'm in love with James Spader, but this movie did NOTHING for me.I now need to go add 1 star to all my previously rated 1- and 2-star flicks. However bad they are, they are nowhere as bad as Crash (1996). Crash deserves to be at the bottom of the barrel all by itself.",Crash
108,arminhage,A movie about nothing!,2,16 September 2014,"After watching Couple of Cronenberg's films I got to the conclusion that probably he wishes to deliver some sort of improved version of Antonioni's nonsense. Generally his movies are within 100 minutes time frame yet the scenes related to the final resolve of his movies are far less, probably 20%. I say improved version not by his genuine intention. He works in Hollywood so he has to deliver something viable for investors with Hollywood mindset. ""Crash"" does not follow the acceptable Hollywood cliché which has been created for a reason, to make movies dynamic. The screenplay follows the 10% rule which has to offer the hero an opportunity out of his ordinary life but after that its free ride of total nonsense. Too many unnecessary and irrelevant scenes and rather disgusting emphasis on body fetish and pornographic to lure audience, make it erotic enough to follow the nonsense. I am not against pornography as long as it contributes to the final resolve of the movie but to squeeze such scenes into the movie to lure the audience, I find it insulting to the intelligence of the viewer and that is exactly what Cronenberg does. The movie is boring and hard to watch in one piece with lots of whispering hard to hear dialogue so I recommend watching the movie with subtitles although one would lose nothing if miss some of of the dialogue due to poor audio management. On short, the movie is about bunch of accident victims who developed accident and trauma fetish and that's it from start to finish, some grotesque scenes and too much sex, irrelevant sex.",Crash
109,m_a_singer,As clear as sheet metal,8,24 April 2001,"There's no need to summarize what has been said in reviews already. However, here are few things that struck me while watching ""Crash"":Don't look for meaning in the dialog. Vaughn's comment that his earlier explanation of his great ""project"" was just a surface misdirection to sucker in likely partners serves as a wry warning to viewers against taking at face value *any* spoken explanation of what is happening.The performances are perfectly in tone with the visual image. I have no idea how Cronenberg and his actors achieved this, though; I can think of no way the director could explain how the actors should move or speak and have it make any sense at all. Everyone appears to be heavily drugged yet highly lucid.As Ballard, Ballard's wife Catherine, and Vaughn go through the car wash, watch the way Ballard touches the rear-view mirror and then the cut to Vaughn touching Catherine's face. The gestures are matched perfectly in their intent. This whole wordless scene seems to be the hinge of the film.This is an extraordinarily beautiful and compelling film. It is also repellent and void of rationality. It may be the perfect projection of the id onto machinery... or something. See the first point above.Nothing else I have ever seen, except for Godard's ""Hail Mary,"" has simultaneously pulled me in and pushed me away with such force and intelligence. I can understand why people hate both films, and I'm hard pressed to recommend that anyone else see ""Crash."" However, I was intrigued enough to do so, and I'm glad that I did.",Crash
110,jackharding89-1,Sex drive...,6,17 April 2012,"Disturbing yet allegorical, emotionally shallow yet erotically fierce, David Cronenberg's crushingly warped world of sex, cars and sex in cars isn't for those who like their films ""middle-of-the-road"". Try ""off- road"". And then some, for Cronenberg's Crash is a perverse, surreal and psychosexual illustration of the apparent links between danger, death and sex with clout that, for all its scandal and sexcitement, ultimately fails to get into top gear. James Spader plays horny TV exec' James Ballard who, following a near fatal car crash with an equally horny Dr. Helen Remington (Holly Hunter), finds himself lured into an uncanny cult where ex-crash victims are bound together by a kinetic lust for the very machines, circumstances and imagery that disfigured their bodies and minds. Taking contentious themes and stretching them to their outer limits such as scopophilia, sadomasochism, serial monogamy, self mutilation and homosexuality, Cronenberg crafts and explores a world driven by auto- eroticism, sexual-oddities and libidinal hungers that feeds on the messages, morals and conventions of the mainstream. A move that'll come to the delight of some but, inevitably, the complete and utter disgust of others. Those who fall into the latter camp: don't bother with Crash. You'd do well to last twenty minutes. The former: sit back, interpret and try to enjoy. With seemingly more scenes of a sexual nature than dialogue (I counted three in the first two minutes), Crash is not for those who bare a faint or chaste heart. It's a prude's worst nightmare. It's provocative, distinct and sexy; a libidinal indie smash of Bunuel-cum-Lynch-like verve whose characters have somewhat idealistic and incalculable sex drives superior to those of a celibate sex addict set loose in Amsterdam. The result? Cinematic smut in pure overdrive that depraves and astounds.",Crash

112,sam_3,Dead Fish,1,23 April 2002,"This one was a dead fish, and probably was intended to be. So much media hype, and not much in the film which lived up to it. It has already been said that this is not meant to be a porn flick, and believe you me, this is not. Red Shoe Diary does it much convincingly.And the whole thing is, just boring. The characters are living the boredom, even with their extremely violent behaviour, and we don't know whether it's a failure on the production's side, or a failure on the viewers' side (for not understanding it), or whether it was just meant to be boring. Sex, Lies and Videotape (also staring Spader) comes close to this, but in that film you could at least enjoy the sexual aspect of it. Oh it was erotic, a fine pornography with brain. But as for this one, nothing is attractive. I believe this deserved to be banned, not only because of the morally deteriorated presentation (which I agree it is), but more so because this film contributes nothing to the audience.So what do we learn from this film? 1. Drive safe, 2. stick with your spouse, and 3. do not dance to the music which the media plays (and I suspect none of these lessons were intended anyway). Reminds me a bit of the lesson I learned from Princess D** na's tragic accident.Because there are plenty of controversies tangling along on the surface, the viewers are welcome to read almost anything into it: affirmation of sexual depravity, cynical view of (post) modern set of value, critique of whatever else, you name it, you'll find it. So if you want to act like a clever film critique in front of your girlfriend, view this one and say whatever you want to say. You'll probably impress her.

113,SanTropez_Couch,"""...sex and car crashes"" Plus: Cronenberg, one of the most daring of all older filmmakers",8,1 March 2003,"Every few years a movie like this comes along that is like no other, probably only one filmmaker could have made it, is made with fresh audacity and seems utterly confident.One of the criticisms the film got was that, ""sure it's daring but it has no point."" I would rarely ever say what a film's point is -- it's different for all of us -- and I often find that when a film is so obviously made only to illustrate a point or reflect something in modern society that it really misses the mark on what filmmaking is all about. However, is the film only about ""...sex and car crashes,"" like Janet Maslin would have us believe? On a somewhat superficial level, I'm sure this movie is about just that -- people whose fetish happens to involve wrecked cars. The sleek, metallic surface; the revving engine; the Pulsating Power of the Pistons turns them on. On another, attached, level it's about the link sex and cars have had since the 40s or whenever cars became a popular location for teenage coitus. It's also about the fetishizing (it's a word) of cars, and machinery in general. It may also be, as a reviewer on this site mentioned, a comment on film sex.The film briefly addresses car crashes and a more normal impact they have on the driver. Spader says, ""There seems to be three times as many cars as there were before the accident."" In Spader's first drives after the accident, Cronenberg really captures the tense unease of post-crash driving. Soon after, however, the characters are driving recklessly down freeways, bashing into each other.Someone also criticized the film for having no character development. Now, I'm all for growth and change, but isn't it more likely that a character will stay basically who he is? I mean, I speak the same today as I did yesterday.Some people have also noted -- and I agree with them -- that the characters in the film aren't really heterosexual, bisexual or homosexual, that they're just sexual beings looking to get off and that the gender of the partner (or their own) doesn't matter. I think the film is sexy despite itself. It's as if it tries its damnedest to show graphic sex and have it be completely anti-erotic, that we're lifted onto a platform of intensely erotic sexuality. I can completely understand why people would be bothered by this and the film. I mean, we've got Unger describing the scene of a car crash to Spader as she manually jerks his stick shift and Spader and Koteas licking each other's car-related tattoos. And autoeroticism (hee hee) isn't enough for these characters, they actually have to re-enact famous car crashes. And for all the hubbub made about Spader and Koteas' sex scene, Hunter and Arquette also have a go at each other in the backseat of a car.The actors here are all brave and they each have their distinctive qualities. Hunter looks as if she's missing something (or someone) and substituting sex for whatever it is she's lost. Unger reminded me of Patricia Arquette in that damaged type of innocence. Koteas is the most evil-looking of all the characters, probably because of his long laceration scars. Arquette (that's Rosanna), has her screwed up legs and Spader, amongst these people, is the most attractive of the bunch. He's got his usual seediness and sexually ambiguous secrecy.Aside from the fact that it may be the most famous celebrity car crash ever, the James Dean crash in the film holds a special significance, I think. For anyone who's read up on him and is familiar with the rumors of sexual deviance, the film, I think, draws an interesting parallel with the film's characters and him, most likely unintended. (Or maybe intended -- I've read and seen Cronenberg speak in interviews and he's practically the film world's biochemist -- I'm sure he thought out every avenue.)
Now, I haven't read Ballard's book so I don't know if this is based somewhat on actual events, or if naming characters after him and his wife was a joke or if it was a metaphor for what was going on in Ballard's brain. As if he named the characters after himself and his wife because that's who he is in his mind, just unwilling to actually act out on his fantasies.The look of the film is silvery and gleaming, mixed with purples and blues and reds that look like the bruises on Spader's face. The way Cronenberg films the cars driving -- often with the camera attached (I'm assuming) to the front side of the cars -- is memorable.Cronenberg made this film when he was in his early 50s. Here's someone who doesn't mellow as he ages, he just becomes more polished. The coldness of the film is reminiscent of Kubrick, I thought, and specifically ""A Clockwork Orange,"" probably because of the sex in either film. His dedication to disease is like Lynch and I felt the presence of Atom Egoyan in a few of the frames, someone who's probably influenced heavily by Cronenberg. I'd recommend this to anyone interested in Cronenberg, weird films, or anyone interested in seeing cars go fast and get banged up. If that was the film's tagline, I'm sure it would have made twice as much as ""Speed"" or ""Gone in Sixty Seconds."" And this one's got sex to boot.***1/2",Crash
114,Skeptic459,What a bunch of weirdo's! Awesome movie!,8,30 December 2003,"Crash caused a huge stir in the United Kingdom. Many conservatives were outraged by the combination of sex, already an issue of danger because of aids, and traffic accidents. Dangerous driving is like smoking, a subject that you just can't touch without many moral watchdogs chasing you through a hellish puritan junkyard.I remember seeing this and a middle aged to elderly man in the theater began to quite obviously...ahem...trouser cough. This was one hell of a way to clear the cinema! That moment is pretty much like this film. Crash has weird sex and masterbation, stuff that you do not really want to see. But David Cronenberg with the help of James Ballard drags us into a world that just takes the whole 'I love cars' boy racer thing way too far! It is just not healthy...Ballard writes in a bleak monotone. A monotone that Chuck Palahniuk seeks to imitate unsuccessfully. All of his characters are alien because of their lack of emotion. Cronenberg takes this aspect and runs with it. This makes the film good not because of the familiarity and sympathy that the viewer can build with the characters. It is actually quite the opposite, the film strikes the viewer because of the sheer UNREALITY of what is happening. The complete and utter icy way that everything is presented just leaves the viewer going 'what?' Am I watching a bunch of jellyfish here?  The characters are so jaded. Trying desperately to experience emotion in an industrialized emotionless world. A world that has become nothing more than a production line. Good Ford! Sorry, Huxley joke. Nerdy but necessary.Also, Cronenberg is presenting a discourse that the famous intellectual Donna Haraway puts forward. That basically the human race has become cyborgs. The the human form is constantly changing. That machines are changing our humanity and crash seems to say that our own sexuality can mingle with the mundane machines that we hold so dear. Oh no! I am getting flashbacks of the crazed artist Stellarc...no...no...no! Besides I bet in the future, terminators would make much more money as sexual partners, rather than as assassins. Imagine that, a beautiful spouse who always thinks your right and never argues with you. I LOVE THE FUTURE!Sex is considered to be the ultimate joining of two people. The most intimate way that human beings can connect to one another. Wrong! This film suggests that sex means...well, nothing really. Procreation and a simple physical reaction. This is shown by James Spader and his wife's, Deborah Unger, relationship. These two are so jaded they tell each other their sexual adventures for attempted excitement but feel absolutely nothing. Certainly not some sought of emotional closeness to one another.This film is just so incredibly empty. But it is also a comment on the human condition. How we make almost suicidal attempts to attain pleasure. If this was a film about heroin for instance, about junkies, this film would be much more understandable. Ballard has taken this addictive, self destructive behaviour and replaced it with an everyday object. The motor car. It is a brilliantly simple idea! But look at how many people it has horrified and offended! C'mon people, are we really this stupid? Sex and drugs, sex and violence. Sex, drugs and violence. These things are all o.k. Portrayed constantly in Hollywood movies. Van Diesel anybody? But sex and car accidents, how dare you? What kind of a sick freak are you??!! Consider how hypocritical this is when you watch something like Fast and the Furious.This is also a film that features the psychological nature of fetish heavily. Instead of having the common fetish for breasts or bottoms, which again people might find more understandable. The fetish is actually for wounds and crash test dummy videos! That scene with Rosanna Arquette, ewww! Would that work? This is definitely something that no one should try at home.David Cronenberg really deserves credit for making this film. He really has some big balls and respects the intelligence of the audience, which I however do not. All of the actors deserve much credit for taking on some truly difficult material. They must really trust the director. I'm surprised no one said 'no David, you are out to lunch on this one!' This film could have become a parody so easily. Never have I seen a film where everyone in the audience seemed so uncomfortable with the material. In fact, when I saw this film without the trouser coughing, people still walked out. It hasn't been since Salo that I have see a movie upset so many people. I give this 8 out of 10 for sheer weirdness. A great moment in a   major auteur's career who is not afraid to take risks. Hollywood take note!",Crash
115,chicklet-2,yuck,3,19 May 1999,"It starts with a good, if completely immoral and reprehensible, premise of people getting off on car wrecks.  Sound ridiculous?  Because it is, so ridiculous that it's plausible.  I'm sure groups just like this truly exist. That's what makes this a potentially interesting movie.  Its extremely novel take on sex and death, the two most fascinating topics, could have made this a great movie, and the presence of an actress like Holly Hunter lures you into believing that it will be.  Well, you're wrong.  The characters are completely void of emotion or any real thought.  They are only interested in the physicality of sex and death.  They never touch on the emotionality of the experiences or why they are so intimately connected with one another.  They just have a whole lot of sex in cars.  Another difficulty is the lack of any sort of dialogue.  No true exchanges occur of any kind be they verbal or otherwise.  Therefore, there is never any meaning given to the film.  It's just straight, meaningless, sadistic sex.  Hunter and Arquette deliver the best performances in the film both of which are substandard for the caliber of the actresses, especially Hunter. > overall, not worth it.  it was ridiculous.",Crash

I feel like I can criticize it harshly because I am a Cronenberg fan and this was nowhere close to his best work. The themes (sexual ""deviance,"" violence, obsession) that Cronenberg was exploring are very relevant to today's post-modern society. However, this film didn't get the message across. Supposedly the book by James Ballard deals more with our obsession with fame and celebrities; that was not dealt with in the film and it should have been. It would have resulted in a more coherent piece of art. As you watch the movie, you feel like a kid watching late-night TV and stumbling upon something ""dirty"" that you know you aren't supposed to see. That's about it. As an adult, you know that there is supposed to be symbolism, an underlying metaphor or allegory, but the viewer is never really let in on the secret. Instead, we see a lot of strange sex scenes, car crashes and empty dialogue.

These men and women feel a sense of liveliness through bodily tortures, yet their extreme pleasures will only take them to one place, that is death.

The alternative for the filmmakers would have been to actually choose one of the real sexual obsessions humans experience and build their story around that.  But that would have failed on so many levels, just as an example it would have been less categorically sweeping and therefore less symbolic.The problem is the bulk of the film audience missed the symbolism entirely, and therefore missed the message.

I think he got it wrong with this one. The reason I like Cronenberg is because he successfully bridges the gap between genre and art-house films to create something odder and more intense than either. The two movies of this period Crash and eXistenZ show that he has lost this talent and is happy to revert to type. Crash is arty and eXistenZ is candy.

Cutting on action to mirrored reflections, in combination with provocative slider shots, allows the film to take on a kinetic and seductive energy, as it moves from one situation to the next. It's a style that works nicely in combination with the film's inherent hypersexuality. The fact that its structured like a porno flick involving sexually charged deformities who ritualize and fetishize the scars that embroider their skin is fascinating, and the subject matter is for sure in the right hands. Ultimately, it felt too subdued to fully grip me, though, and while I remained intrigued throughout, I never felt fully connected to the psychology at play.

Cronenberg's merit is simply that he stays away from mainstream cinema and continues to make utterly bizarre movies.""Crash"" however is completely pointless, without tension or development of a climax. It centers around a group of people fascinated by car accidents and sex. Half of the movie deals with every possible couple in the group having sex with each other in the vicinity of car wreckage. The scene in which the company is sitting in front of the TV touching each others genitals (though dressed) is probably the most ridiculous scene Cronenberg has ever filmed. James Spader is annoying as usual.The film is only saved by its dark atmosphere and Howard Shore's excellent-as-usual score.",Crash
126,Phoenix-36,"Curious, odd, but flawed examination of sexuality/identity.",6,26 January 1999,"David Cronenberg's most recent film. Set in Los Angeles, James Spader and Deborah Unger play a couple drawn into an  underworld of odd characters who are sexually aroused by automobile crashes. Spader discovers this when he hits Holly  Hunter's car head on, killing her husband. They become lovers, meeting in a parking garage, having (unsatisfying) sex in a parked car. Later they are involved with a clique that re-enacts famous crashes for excitement.It's a fascinating premise and it starts off quite promising. However, Spader's patented flat, emotionally dead anti-hero never shows a spark of life. Nor do any of the other characters. And yet, while there is an attempt to capture that serene surface perfected by David Lynch, the attempt fails. In the end we do not care what happens to any of these characters. It becomes an exercise in guessing who will sleep with who next. Even the final scene, in which Spader and Unger are brought back together, fails to move because we have never cared about either of them. It felt like getting the news that your cousin twice removed, who you have never met, is getting married. You know you are supposed to feel happy for them but, frankly, you just don't care.On the other hand, the movie is visually lush, and does take some legitimate risks. Spader has a gay sex-scene that, as tame as it was, is a true rarity in American theaters. Even ""Faith! Hope! and Glory!"" did not come close. One scene deserves especial mention. A group including Spader, Hunter, and Rosanne Arquette are watching video tapes of safety tests of automobiles, starring the test dummies. As they watch they become increasingly aroused. They are all completely absorbed in films that were shot by engineers. Like low-budget porn, the videos are grainy, out of focus, and have no camera movement. Nevertheless, the scene is oddly hysterical.Cronenberg also keeps close to home in another way. He always seems to be obsessed with violation. In his films this is represented literally. Here we have a number of characters whose bodies are violated with pins and braces administered by doctors. Not for the squeamish, although the scenes are not gory. But to see the male nurse just poking at people's apparatus and wounds is unsettling (recalls the Monty Python skit where the major missing a leg has it poked by his superior office, asking if it hurts).",Crash

Even if I thought it necessary to see if it is possible to have sex during a crash whilst licking a scar, (not something that had occurred to me) I don't think I could stay awake long enough to decide.

128,rettercritical,Prophecy is ragged and dirty,10,2 July 2009,"Despite its subject matter CRASH may be Cronenberg's most subtle shocker. The narrative is a sinking into an underworld. A group of injured people who have all at some point suffered automobile collisions, falling for each other, returning and fetishising the experience of the car-crash. Unorganised and organically forming in the wake of their individual near death experiences (of the car crash) to be lived over and over like a mantra. Sex has again become the animal act it once was with decisive promiscuity at the heart of the film. Often criticised for cold and emotionless lives I believe the story offers a highly deep level of human relations. Physical contact with one another. Forceful sex is just as common as a loving embrace in this film. An unofficial support group who take on their fears head on and look death strait in the eye.There is a violence coupled with sex. The life altering events they chose to live again and again is the car crash. Rather than question this motivation I just accept that it has become a natural choice for these characters to return there. There seems to be an understanding between these damaged figures that differentiates them from the wider community. As if baptised by accident they return to the motifs, cold broken shells and even racing bodies of the automobile. The night is theirs to experiment with impulsive, careless journeys around the roads and highways of the airport. It is theirs to be reunited with the crash.For a film so violent it is comforting to know there is no villain. There is no bad guy. The closest thing would be dissatisfaction but that can be solved with a forward sexual act. Following desire seems to be the best therapy for this group. Led by a confident character called Vaughan, played by Elias Koteas, the group follows a pattern part bohemian part wild pack of jaguars. Vaughan has a vision with no conclusion. His infectious energy creates a cult around him as he forges ahead with not only returning to the crash over and over with photographs, scrapbooks and diatribe but as literal performance. In perhaps Cronenberg's masterstroke of the film Vaughan re-enacts the James Deen crash for real at high speed with another vehicle. This set piece on a strip of bitumen, topped off with walky-talky organised choreography, is performed in front of an outdoor grand stand filled with a curious audience on the fringe. A late-night theatre lit sparsely with floodlights is a car crash.James Ballard, played by James Spader, is to become Vaughan's protégé. Under his wing Ballard enters a world after having his own car crash. Ballard seems perfect for this incestuous group, as he already exists in an open but apparently functional relationship. The car crash has shifted his presence to this world or community where he will now function out his promiscuity among the fellow survivors. He will learn from Vaughan and eventually become him.The film achieves a certain blue tone, an icy cold feel, as the days are overcast and the night roads shiny with rain. Great attention is taken to how things are shot. We are made to look at the automobile in a different way with camera angles that force closer inspection of the everyday motorcar. Its hard metal exteriors shaped like raging animals and its sexy interiors perfect soft places for gratification. A musical score winds repetitively through the film. Howard Shaw's theme reminds us of the cycle as it returns with chilly electric guitar prompting the swift lane changes and casual swapping of sexual partners for new experiences.This is Cronenberg's best sci-fi. A distillation of JG Ballard's explicit novel, which is turned from internal monologue of the book to passive observer. Sci-fi that is barely that because it is about concepts of culture. Possabilities more so of humans reacting to the technology than of the technology itself. A grey existential and subjective view. Expressing the highways as arteries and the car as a means to travel if not exist in the modern world. The beating heart of the airport, a city within a city, pumps concrete and electric life to its surrounding earth. A concentration of energy that supports all kinds of existence. Left to interpret the actions of the film an audience can go either way. The chain of sex scenes and car drives as a narrative may be inaccessible for some or intriguing to others. You can shut off immediately and dismiss the story or remain curious and open. The latter may give you a very rewarding experience.Mike Retterhttp:/mikeretter.tripod.com",Crash

When the chase between Vaughn, James and Catherine is happening, and Vaughn smashes into the back of the garbage truck, the driver just keeps going along without even so much as honking his horn!  I know Canadians are not as violent as Yankees, but I don't think they are THAT much more tolerant as to allow people to smash into their vehicle without getting p***ed off.2.

Then, they meander around the crash scene, taking pictures and getting in the way of the rescue team without even so much as a word from them.  I mean, come on!

Scar tissue, car wrecks, death and pretty graphic sex, all wrapped up in some very stylish photography.The characters eagerness to relive the trauma of the car crash and the, admittedly, sick - but nevertheless exciting - mixture of sex and death is quite effective. These people SHOULD be in grief, fighting to get back to a normal life, but instead they return to that strange moment of fright and sexual arousal, in the second before the cars smash into each other.The movie doesn't try to explain anything - it just tells the story.

135,revcosmo,wasted cronenberg...,7,24 November 2005,"I should start off by saying that I'm an enormous Cronenberg fan. In fact, Crash is the only Cronenberg film I've seen that has really disappointed me. One of Cronenberg's greatest gifts is the creation of characters who, despite having an assortment of extremely unusual characteristics and enduring most surreal situations (turning into a fly, being fed hallucinations over a TV signal, etc), are nonetheless deeply human, evoking compassion and often pity and even sympathy. This, or rather the lack of this, is the primary flaw in Crash. The characters are wooden; they do not seem attached to their motives or to have any sort of life or personality outside being a vehicle for their motives. After the first 20 or 30 minutes, I just didn't really care what happened to any of them.I also tend to agree with the other reviewers who felt that this movie wasn't the shocker it's often portrayed as. Cronernberg has given us some mighty visceral imagery over the years, but fails to serve up anything really gut-wrenching in Crash. That isn't to say Crash doesn't have its share of sex, violence, and violent sex; it certainly does. But such scenes don't have the impact they should; like the characters, they come off as wooden and fail to engage the viewer's emotions. In a sense, you could say that Crash has many of the standard elements of Cronenberg's film making, except the spirit.Fortunately, Cronenberg has more than made up for it since; Spider (2002) and A History of Violence (2005) rank among his best works. Even the brightest of geniuses must be allowed a slump every now and then, and Crash is such a slump in an otherwise brilliant body of work.",Crash

Beyond that, I fail to see any story line beyond the obvious notion that near death experiences can result in closer physical relationships. Maybe this is true and I've heard as much before in the real world, but frankly I view 'Crash' as nothing short of pornographic in content and more deserving of the 'X' rating.

What's the matter, you don't like thinking? Because all of this feedback can't be attributed to the more sensational elements of the film... one doesn't have to look far to find a film with more sex, violence, or grotsequerie... and therefore the film must be considered successful in its attempt to provoke thought and debate. It makes sense that the audience which enjoys mindless, hackneyed, contrived, by-the-numbers Hollywood idiotfests like 'Armageddon' would resent a film which challenges them to actually (gasp) think about something, especially something which doesn't fit into the acceptable subject matter of literature and cinema. To those poor close-minded viewers, my advice is to stay away from anything which says ""Directed by David Cronenberg"" or ""A novel by J.G. Ballard"" and stick with ""Starring Jim Carrey"". As for Cronenberg and/or Ballard fans who were disappointed by Crash, yikes I can't imagine what you were hoping for. Ballard himself considers Cronenberg's film a work of genius, saying that it's captured all of the necessary elements of his novel. Crash is a milestone piece of cinema, equal in daring and psychological scope to Pasolini's Salo. Both films are similarly polarizing in that they're difficult for conventionally-minded audiences to accept and recognized as classics by those who are up to the psychopathological challenges they present. If you fall into the latter category, my advice is read the book, see the film. For those who enjoyed Crash, I can highly recommend BFI's Modern Classics serie",Crash

Of course there's a good side to the movie, but for me it's more of a reminder that we've all been making stupid mistakes that we take for granted. Is racism only between whites and blacks?

I think we miss that touch so much that we crash into each other just so we can feel something."" Crash 2005 is a blockbuster on the controversial subject of racial tensions in Los Angeles. Crash 1996 was just plain controversial. A decade ago the British press ran a series of front page appeals for governmental pressure to ban a new film which they'd described as ""Beyond the bounds of depravity."" The 1973 J.G Ballard novel, on which the film is based, had long been a favourite of mine but as the controversy raged on throughout the summer of '96' it became apparent that the film may never be shown in the U.K. Crash had already been released in France, so by the time this idiocy hit the point where an audience of paraplegics were invited for a special screening to see if they were offended or not, I had no choice but to leave for Paris where exactly one year later Ballard's 'cautionary tale' of car crash celebrity deaths would reach an apotheosis of sorts in an underpass at the Pont D'Alma.Described by its author as ""the first pornographic novel about technology"" the book is about a group of car crash survivors who, led by deranged T.V scientist Vaughn, see the car crash as a new form of sexual perversion. Vaughn's ultimate fantasy is to die in a head-on collision with the actress Elizabeth Taylor who, throughout the 60's and 70's was the Princess Diana of her day; constantly hounded by the press and ultimately crucified on the beam of her own celebrity. The film adaptation, directed by David Cronenberg, avoids the heavy traffic of 'serial bride' Liz's potential legititive clout and instead becomes 'a futuristic love story set in the present'. James (James Spader) and Catherine (Deborah Kara-Ungar) are a married couple so filled with inertia that they are desperate for some emotional connection by any means necessary. After a series of extra martial encounters they find themselves attracted to a group of disturbed members of a bizarre car-crash sect who enact famous car crashes for kicks. The pair soon find themselves willing accomplices in a tableaux of violence and desire until finally they attain some provisional approximation of actual love.Kara-Ungar's portrayal of Catherine exemplifies perfectly the icy detachment of a woman who appears to be observing herself from another galaxy. Unfortunately, the film hinges on a moment where the groups leader Vaughn, played by Elias Koteus who explains his philosophy of auto-geddon as a fertilising event rather than a destructive one to his disciple James. Koteus' delivery is addled and Spader (understandably) laughs; blowing the scene and almost the entire film with it.Nevertheless Crash is, above all, a brave attempt to explore an almost un-bearable subject  the death of affect and our unconscious desire for violence. As we're bombarded with pseudo-events and war entertainment - designed to make us consume in ways that are of optimum benefit to multi-national conglomerates who really (forget governments) walk where the power is  Cronenberg's Crash is as much a road sign warning of our impending emotional bankruptcy as it is to the sexual ambiguity of the highway pile up.",Crash
142,Radiant_Rose,"oddly intriguing (but the ""auto erotic"" joke has been done already)",8,8 October 2007,"The best thing about this is the music Howard Shore composed for it. It is exactly right for this film. It sounds like the heartbeat of a cyborg.I was expecting to be more shocked by this film than I actually was. The injuries are not particularly stomach churning. In the original novel by J G Ballard, the hero (whom he named James Ballard after himself) suffers a scalp laceration and some kind of stomach injury that involves a description of what happened to his bowel contents.In fact, the novel contains a lot about bodily fluids, including a poetic description of vomit and much, much more. This element is rather lacking from the film.I saw the film before I read the novel, so I was not sure what to expect from it.The characters never get out of their depths. I wondered if one of them would find himself or herself stuck in a situation he or she could not handle: too badly injured, or in too much pain, but that never happens.Given Cronenberg's history as a director of horror films, I did wonder about one of the characters actually dying and wondered what sort of afterlife they might find. Again, any concept of the afterlife was missing.Reviewers often bracket this together with two of James Spader's other films, ""sex, lies and videotape"" and ""Secretary"". I think one of the big differences between this and those films is that in them, there is a heroine who breaks through the barrier Spader's character has erected (pun intended) around himself. In ""Crash"", his character stays firmly in his own weird little world.It is odd that he shares his first name with the character he plays, but that can only be coincidence.I am not sure if the script girl we briefly see near the start of the film is fully naked, but of the main cast, Deborah Kara Unger is the only one who is completely fully frontally naked.I wasn't very impressed by the film the first time I saw it, but there is something about it that is quite haunting. Parts of it stay in the memory.",Crash

That said, Crash is a boring movie and not so much edgy as something to be endured. Crash does not feel cool or adventurous and yet most of the film is action; it is like a pornographic movie -- not much plot but just goes through different scenarios, yet does not feel sexy and so does not create tension. The vibe is corrupt, uncool, and dystopic like a glam rock band playing in the mid 90s to a bored audience in a half-filled stadium that needs to be torn down. They smash their gear and we can only think that it was not worth it, what a waste. I would like to think this was all intentional, because I like other Cronenberg films, but cannot really recommend it except to the curious ones that want to see something different.",Crash
144,bpstraycat,Watch this movie,3,8 June 2006,"This film concerns horrific subjects: Mutilation, death, and just about the silliest set of sexual perversions one can imagine. The worst thing about is that despite its total commitment to portraying filth in a very boring way, it is a lot better than many of the pathetic moralistic stories with which the US film industry continues to carpet-bomb the world. Watch this film, then wonder why this nonsense is more engaging than 80% of films made in Hollywood in the last ten years.When you have trudged through the lack of story, the superfluous sex, the very unattractive characters and all the rest of this megadeath of monstrosity, maybe you can consider that the author, JG Ballard, (one of the finest writers of contemporary psychodelic nightmares), is trying to make fun of the car-caressing, fender-feeling, specification - sucking class of humans who live and breathe auto-masturbation. This movie has cars, engines, naked girls, the whole lot. The only factor that defines it as imagination is that they are all torn and disfugered. However they retain their intrinsic functions.Watch it - I really recommend it. Then watch 'Priscilla, Queen of the Desert' as an antidote to our own crashing stupidity.",Crash

The film is more bizarre rather than offensive and it does have some great, genuinely erotic moments. It starts off promisingly enough but then the middle part of the film just seems to be an endless succession of everyone screwing everyone which I found rather tedious. It seemed to me as though the film was trying TOO hard to be shocking. Not having read the book, I can't say whether this is the fault of the film or the book.Koteas is excellent as Vaughan as are Deborah Unger and James Spader. For me the real star of this film is the superb music written by Howard Shore - electric guitars playing complex melodies over shifting chromatic harmonies. The music is instantly memorable.The film is worth watching as there is an interesting surreal atmosphere to be enjoyed and some highly charged, inventive dialogue. I found more subtleties in the film, the more I watched it.",Crash

The characters seem to act in a kind of daze, doing things as if by impulse.

There are some really disturbing shots in this film and some awkward love scenes, but like a good car accident you won't be able to take your eyes off of it. The characters are detached and zombie like while the fetishize about the strangest of things. Lots of allusions and reenactments of famous car accidents, Cronenberg did his homework. The characters in this movie are bizarre to the extreme. Rosalina Arquette shows that handicapped women can still be sexy. Holly Hunter is the woman in the business suit gone wrong, and Debra Kara Unger is detached and catatonic to the point of creepiness.

The most interesting thing about this film is the way it is just ageneral criticism on America's obsession with action (car crashesin movies) and sex.  Cronenberg just takes the next logical step incombining the two, somewhat a la George in Seinfeld with foodand sex. Some of it definitely drags, especially the love scene betweenSpader and Koteas that for some reason feels too long before itever starts. The re-inactment of celebrity car crashes that they go see isdefinitely cool though, and somehow realistic of a potentialmodern fetish.  Still, I like Crony's old stuff much better.",Crash

I'm trying to figure out if the director of the movie put all the naked women in to keep people like me watching until the end of the movie, or if this incredibly ridiculous movie was made as a way for beautiful women to get naked on screen.

Or maybe it is some sort of commentary about pornography or relationships in modern society.  Whatever the case, the point is very obscure.With the tone of ironic detachment, I felt I was being held at arm's length throughout the film and given no clue as to how I should feel about the characters.  Am I supposed to sympathize with them, pity them?  It's hard to do since they show about as much emotion as HAL in 2001.

Early on the plot tries to surface but fails soon after, eventually ""crashing"" in to a kind of plot soup that is pure garbage. This is best shown in the films ending where suddenly after having some kind of sudo-gay love affair the two male leads suddenly hate each other and one of them (after a cheezy car-chase scene) flies over a guard rail and exploads.

153,christmas_28,...A Mesmeric Masterpiece of Unexpected Profoundness...,10,6 January 2001,"I can safely say that David Cronenberg's ""Crash"" is one of the most unique motion picture experiences I've had in a long time.  Now that's not saying that I particularly liked the film.  Half way through the film, I starting asking myself, ""What exactly IS this film about?""  My original answer was ""sex and car crashes.""  But by the time the film had reached its conclusion, I realized that ""Crash"" is a lot more than that.  It's 25% bizarre, 25% disturbing, 50% erotic, and 100% ingenious.  I've concluded that there is no REAL plot to the film.  The characters just go around and have sex.  But, at a second glance, I realized that ""Crash"" is not simply about people with strange sexual fetishes, but it's a psychosexual journey into the minds of these people.  Everything that Cronenberg shows us is completely relevant to the characters.  And while the expression of his creativity is done in a blatantly pornographic style, the truth of the matter is that there is absolutely nothing pornographic about the picture.  Aside from the numerous explicit sex scenes, it's a profound and concise psychological drama.  The sex scenes are merely the vehicle in which Cronenberg gets his point across.And what is the point of a film that has no point to begin with?  Exactly. There is no point.  All that ""Crash"" does is take us into a deep world of sexual disturbance at the hands of numerous sexually disturbed characters.James Spader, Holly Hunter, and Elias Koteas all give performances that are hard to describe.  It's like watching actors in a silent film, but still feeling that deep prophetic wisdom that seems to be emanating from them. Though there is nothing wise about their characters' choices or dialogue, just the way they carry themselves provides the film with a self-assured aura that is neither pretentious nor ostentatious.Throughout everything, Cronenberg's film manages to become a mesmeric masterpiece of unexpected profoundness and dramatic brilliance.  ""Crash"" has nothing to do with anything, and it most certainly is not a likeable film. I respect the film for its courage and deep understanding of the human sexual psyche, but this one is seriously not for the average viewer.  It's a powerful and brutally honest film that never ceases to shock, but at the same time seems to be an empty vat of nothingness.  But for those seeking an original, brave, and ultimately hypnotic picture, ""Crash"" is the one for you.Grade:  A",Crash

156,Yuto_Zeiram,The Orgasm of Burning Rubber.,8,13 March 2006,"""How many orgasms per mile can you get ?"" This is one of the catching tag lines of the movie ""Crash"". Again Cronenberg delivers a dive into human psychic, the world of dark obsession, and twisted fantasy's. The plot:A sexually frustrated couple starts experimenting with the outlines of anonymous sex. It is the husband James Ballard (James Spader) who gets into a car crash with Dr. Ellen Remington (Holly Hunter) and her husband. They crash frontally and both Ballard and Remington are seriously injured. Remington's husband dies while being launched from his seat through his own windshield into Ballards. Ballard ends up in the hospital, traumatized, trying to recover from his injuries. He gets into deeper contact with Helen Remington. Their mutual Crash-victim status brings them closer together, ultimately delivering them into the sump-oil-soaked world of the pathological Vaughan (Elias Koteas). Renegade scientist and leader of a strange subterranean group, Vaughan is only able to achieve sexual release by crashing into people on the motorways surrounding Heathrow airport. Getting sucked into his world, Ballard becomes obsessed with car crashes, and dives into the illegal world of ""thrill seeking"" and raw and hard (but mostly cold) sex.The review:To be quiet honest ""Crash"" is a very underestimated picture. First of all there are a serious amount of people who thought that the subject was laughable, and not to be taken serious, for how could you take something like this serious ? After crashing your car and being injured, having sex with the victim of a car-crash ? Apart from the post-traumatic stress that can appear after such an incident it also triggers a lot of adrenaline, which is almost a self produced drug. Cronenberg cuts a subject which is still very much of a taboo, the ""thrill seeking taboo"". You got a lot of so called thrill seekers now these days, which can result into ghost riding on the freeway, climbing on buildings without security etc. All in all the thrill seek element isn't that original. This is where Cronenberg has looked for a thrill that rushes into a perverse sexual outburst. After the shock of crashing into a car, the adrenaline, the rush of the experience becomes so real, you feel so alive that you need to let it all out, which comes into the act of ""making love"". Cronenberg is trying to paint the audience a picture of an event like this. Based on J.G. Ballards novel ""Crash"" which was quiet detached and cold, the director follows in style with the dark freeways of Canada, showing that even in your car you are not always save, and how a car can become the ultimate ""drive"" for pleasure. The problem with this film (like many others) is that it is so far out there that you either hate it or love it. The pacing is rather slow in the beginning and its hard to get into, if you don't understand the psychology that lies underneath the dialog. The movie has a solid script but the subject and material is not accessible for everybody. James Spader who often (he almost could be a stereotype) plays sexual frustrated protagonists (""Sex,Lies,and Videotapes"", ""Secretary"", ""Speaking of Sex"") delivers a terrific performance here. His distant and alienated acting fits perfectly into the dark en and sensual story, and doesn't come as a insincere or ""over the top"". Some people felt that Koteas and Hunter performances where a little flat, but they have just the balance between low key and an over the top performance (Koteas more than Hunter). You got to keep in mind that these people are already deranged from the beginning. What you see is simply a drop falling into bucket that is overflowing. The use of light and shadow is very subtle and excellently done by cinematographer Peter Suschitzky. He really knows how to pull you into a certain world, that LOOKS like ours but feels very different. In any case I can recommend the movie if you want to watch something different. A lot of people will not understand the weight this film carries, and therefore this movie will be underrated, or simply will be put aside as boring or unrealistic. THIS IS A MISTAKE,... don't put it away, watch it, and feel the awkwardness. The result ? ""Humans really are quiet weird creatures...""",Crash

The characters were more like a group of sex ghouls than people that were disconnected from their world and needed the perverted stimulous of car crashes to feel alive during sexual acts.  The only pleasant part of this film was the continual body exposure of Deborah Unger.

162,clare-karu,erotic and indefinable,9,25 May 2012,"I have no idea what this movie is meant to be about - but here are some of my thoughts anyway.The movie is definitely erotic and meant to be so. The scenes between Catherine and James Ballard and Vaughn are just about some of the most highly charged erotic scenes in the history of cinema.Of course - this is discomforting - the basis of the erotic charge between these characters are brutal car crashes.There is a particularly disturbing scene where Vaughn photographs an accidental car crash and Catherine and James wander around, dazed, but clearly aroused by the situation and each other's responses to it. The nexus between violence, machinery and eroticism has never been such an explicit subject for a movie. There are plenty of Hollywood mainstay movies where violence and sex are put together implicitly or as titillation - but its always in the context of a thriller or a crime drama - not the main-game, more the dirty little secret reason why people would go to 'Basic Instinct'or that movie with Glenn Close as a bunny boiler.It interesting to me, the reactions of the audience and the critics to an honest and up-front depiction of this sex and violence duo. A lot of people will say that they look away. But - as in the case of car crashes - if we are to be honest with ourselves - we look. We look because we are fascinated with the human condition. We look out of pity. We look to see if we can help. We look to take in a lesson.We look and then look away because we are ashamed.Then there are the ravings of Vaughn who opines that the car crash is a 'fertilising rather than destructive event' and that he is fascinated with car crashes because they somehow 'unleash' in one powerful moment the sexuality of those involved. Its bizarre. And totally unbelievable until you see it played out. And then you somehow become complicit in that belief. Yeah - the Rosanna Arquette character's femoral shaft surgery scar and braces are sexy. The tattoos of car related insignia on Vaughn and Ballard are too. The whole car crash as erotic thing starts to make sense....And you start thinking... gee how did I get here? Am I a sicko like Vaughn who is two parts repulsively slobbering madman one part charisma and sexy leather jackets and rough grace? As always the erotic is confusing and fascinating, repulsive and attractive, of the self and of the other, enslaving and liberating, sick and healthy.So - all in all - a more honestly sick depiction of human sexuality I can't think of. That doesn't make for an uplifting or soul expanding movie and unfortunately, if you come from a wholesome and moral place in your movie approval schema it won't rate highly.Aaargh! So therefore I am in two minds! If I like it I admit - I'm a sicko. If I don't, I'm basically saying I'm a moralising do-gooder.Impossible!",Crash

At the time I really had no thoughts on it except that I was glad to have not been booted out of the theater. As the years went by though I am suddenly hit with a sense of surreality: ""Was that really what happened in that movie?"". I guess I could rent it to appease my flashbacks/hauntings. I really think this movie was sick, why would anyone make this movie? Ihave two questions: 1) Is it just me or were all of us sort of hypnotized in the 90's, because when it came out nobody pointed out the fact that it was truly abhorrent, & really a sadomasichistic, psychotic porno. I remember the theater was packed and everybody acted like it was nothing. Who else thinks that a movie like this wouldn't do well today? 2) I'm going to guess that the writer & cronenberg presume that there is some deep message here, probably about society, probably apocalyptic too.

Some users have made comment that the characters were too emotionally detached.  I'm of the school of thought that this was done on purpose by the director.  Taking the focus away from character development allowed the audience to absorb the utter grotesqueness that was the hallmark of this movie.  The premise, though outlandish, was not looked at through a jaundiced eye.The acting was outstanding.  A lot has been said about the performances of James Spader, Holly Hunter, Rosanna Arquette, and Elias Koteas.  Deborah Unger's performance sent chills through my spine, as possibly the most seductively sensual/sexual portrayal I've seen.  She more than held her own with the aforementioned players.  This was the first film I had seen her in, and after seeing her since then in two other films, I don't understand why she possibly isn't a bigger star than she is.  Each of her characters has an undercurrent of intense sensuality that literally leaps off the screen. Certainly, her character in Crash was the most sensual of all.Crash is for broad-minded people who like movies, and who enjoy seeing what well-made movies with different ideas or premises can be.

The basic idea that people get sexually aroused from being involved in car crashes is mind boggling. It happens to be it was a very powerful movie, with excellent performaces by almost all the actors, especially Elias Kotais and James Spader. Their homosexual scene was well done, and looked natural. But the sad fact was, that David Croenberg seemed more interested in showing naked bodies, then in fleshing out some of the more interesting parts of the film, such as the society that recreates famous car crashes.The ending, was immensely disturbing, but extremely powerful. I recommend this flick, but it aint for the faint of heart.",Crash

But I was shocked to find out that such an allegorical movie, with such an incredible philosophy, which I personally consider one of the best of the 90s got an average of 5.7! It's amazing! I keep visiting movie pages and I see incredibly misfit user ratings! It is really disgusting! For example, Brotherhood of Wolfs, an action/karate French flick of no artistic value was about 7.1 when I last checked, and The Cell, a movie with great cinematography and fairly good but not THAT good, also had a rating above 7! I keep getting disappointed by some IMDB users. For God's sake, they are so idiotic that immediately after watching a movie in theatres, rate it 10 or 9, they are so compelled and much later they consider their idiocy. For example, the cute but just cute My Big Fat Greek Wedding, was so ridiculously praised, that when it was first rated, the average was 8.3, Jesus Christ! (Hopefully, it isn't so high now, but yet a 7.1 for just a cute but soooo ordinary movie. Imagine, I'm saying that, being Greek!)",Crash

I suppose the effect a piece of art has on you also says something about you as a person. The more disturbing art is the more you hear people discussing it - more and more people asking other people not to watch this because it is 'sick and twisted and disgusting'. But I for one, am pretty sure there is nothing pretentious about this movie. Hacks don't make movies like CRASH which barely receive any mainstream attention - they release movies like TWILIGHT and sit back and watch the money roll in. The movie is about a bunch of people trying to find the ultimate pleasure - and what is more pleasurable than a climax right? They have everything they need - good bodies, cars, jobs, good looking people around them and all the things people think are necessary and yet they find themselves feeling empty. All of a sudden, they end up becoming obsessed with car crashes and victims of car crashes. They feel like this is the way to get what they are lacking. But no matter how far, how sinister - how truly invigorating their experiences are, they cannot find happiness. That's what this movie is about - the quest for happiness - for that feeling of knowing joy of some kind. And whether or not it is possible to find it.",Crash

Its a rarity that I ever cut off a movie mid-way but I did it with this one. This movie should really come with a warning label, if you've ever been in a nasty auto accident, witnessed one first hand or dealt with the survivor of one you may find this flick severely disturbing. I can appreciate that there is a sexual fetish out there for just about everything and remain open-minded to discovery on this. But, this sexual fetish I find hard to believe, and I'm not the type of person who is turned off by scars or amputees. The art-noir attempt came off as tedious and boring, not the least bit fascinating. The lack of substance/explanation/identification with any of the characters is in part a problem. It was hard enough to get through the subject premise without also not having any connection with these characters. There is not too much blood & guts horror, that was not the negative issue here, its just disturbing on a different level. I suppose you could actually create a movie about the subject of sexual fetish related to deadly car accidents and pull it off, but I did not find that to be the case here. Fact is that car accidents don't give me a hard-on and if they do you. you've either never been involved in one or you should seriously check out psychological counseling.",Crash

""It's Cronenberg"" she said ""and if you miss it you'll be moaning for ages"". ""But he's made THE NAKED LUNCH and M BUTTERFLY"" I retorted indignantly ""and they were both s*** so no way...!!!"" Still, the feminine persuasive!!! So along I went...to the small Bastille cinema. I came out 90 or so minutes later looking at both the human sexual condition and the automobile in a VERY different way. That road towards the metro... Cronenberg's CRASH knocked my socks off. It's one of the few films in my post teenage years that has made any impression upon my psyche...sure there have been others; MIDNIGHT EXPRESS, SALVADOR,BLOW OUT etc but CRASH is, ultimately, an honest film from an honest director who has never compromised his vision despite corporate pressure.

Perhaps, that's quite an achievement for the filmmakers. I really did not know what to expect so I continued watching in the hopes that I would get something out of it.As I go on, I am convinced that this is really a weird film. There goes James Ballard and the rest of the characters with their own fetishes motivating their sexual lives (not to mention Vaughan who is really in love with his art called car crash). Basically, the only interest I had in this film was the eroticism (even with the absence of love). So I decided to wait for another boring scene so I could get rid of it. But then, something interesting is brought up--Vaughan (Elias Koteas) expresses something magical about the SEXUALITY of the people who suffered (or died) in car crashes. I figured that there seems to be a connection between ""manipulating a sexual life"" and ""driving a car"". It goes without saying that both, if not maintained, could result to one's doom.Without a doubt, there really is an interesting metaphor that should be thought through.

Not sexy, just stupid.I've been in car accidents myself, and thankfully, no one was injured too badly.

""girls under the age of 18 thought this film deserved...5.1"" Poor dears - they should be reported to their parents, or better still to councillors who will try to undo the damage done by being exposed to such awful trash as this.

I agree CRASH is difficult to watch through the eyes of a movie goer but as someone who appreciates art you are in for a treat.Filmwise, it suffers due to the cut out of scenes between Ballard and his secretary and scenes which are in the script but were not filmed. But having read the script i could forgive these omissions.Performances were excellent especially given the demands of the script and am amazed at the cast assembled.In respect of the film...what is the message...what is the philosophy...what was the point...I interpreted it as the creation and destruction of relationships through the use of cars as an extension of our outer self.

195,jamass,"""crash into me""",9,21 June 2000,"Crash by writer/director David Croenberg is a graphic film about people and their fetishes. Their fetishes are infamous since its showing at Cannes in 1996. Only because probably no one has this addiction and if they did their lives would be short at best.  But that's where the average movie watcher and critic goes wrong, judging the film on what their seeing not what it's saying.You see everyone has a fetish or two, but most people think they can control it when their only fooling themselves. The characters in Crash aren't fooled as their lives revolve around what turns them on, car crashes.  And that's probably where the average person's stomach turns and out of the multiplex they go, thinking how strange and perverse the characters are. But are they?Crash won Canada's version of an oscar, and I think that's a tribute to Canadian cinema. There's no compromise, no diluted material to be found in the film. Great films aren't always liked by audiences because they weren't made to be liked. That's why hollywood recycles scripts that producers know are well liked by a wide variety of people. That's why David Lynch can't seem to find American producers to back him. The result is bland movies that try so hard not to step on anybodies toes that they fail on any and every level of what cinema is.I was surprised by the average 5.5 rating given to such a well written and acted movie. I was going to give it 9 but had to go for a 10 just out of anger at the low score. I mean this was one of the best movies of 1996, and if voters are just going to give it a 1 because they can't view something outside their morals then they shouldn't vote.

197,anshuman218,Crashing in on Crash,9,15 August 2018,"I really love the works of David Cronenberg. His idea of cinema is really wonderful. The kind of atmosphere he creates while delivering his stories is simply fabulous. Recently, i watched his film 'Crash' (1996). Unlike, his other works like 'The Fly' (1986) or 'Videodrome'(1983), i was slightly apprehensive about this one. This was because of the mixed audience response this film had got. No matter, how much we claim that we do not care about the thoughts of others, we are all guilty of basing our reaction after considering others.Nevertheless, i did end up watching 'Crash' and can safely conclude that anyone after watching this one would either love it or simply hate it. It's seems hard to imagine any other kind of reaction considering the subject matter of the film. The plot involves a group of individuals seeking sexual gratification from an unusual source that is a car crash. The film revolves around the character of James Ballard who after having survived through a horrible car accident ends up undergoing a shift in his attitude towards such incidents so much so that he begins getting sexually drawn towards these incidents . This happens after he ends up meeting with a women who was also the victim of the car accident in which he was involved.She introduces him with a person named 'Vaughan' who seems to do nothing but plan car accidents so that he can derive pleasure from them. James ends up getting to be a part of Vaughan's gang. The arousal through these activities ends up improving the sex life of James and his wife who earlier were having passionless sex. As is quite understandable a plot like this would invariably attract wide variety of reaction both positive and negative.For me the important theme that this film tries to portray is based on how an incident like a car crash which is generally associated with tragedy can really be turned into something highly sexual in nature. 'Crash' is the study of human psychology and shows how easily it can be transformed from one particular kind of reaction to another of the same event by just changing the outlook. The incidents of car crashes in this film try not to evoke sympathy from the audience but they actually try to sexually incite the audiences through such incidents.Eventually, whether this film does or does not work for you will depend upon a particular reaction it evokes from the viewer. If the thought of blood,sperm, shredded glass,dirty car etc. together disgusts you then this movie will surely not work for you.",Crash
198,RobertLBJ,A cracked polished vision,9,10 July 2002,"What do you really expect to see in a film by David Cronenberg?In this sense this film contains nothing shocking. Typically for this morbid connoisseur his work is not out to leave viewers settled and comfortable, but to arouse, alert, provoke. Some of his favourite subject areas are lavishly caressed in Crash. The themes of addictive sex and deviant pain were mined in Crash, directly echoing their study in some of his other works, such as Dead Ringers, with Jeremy Irons and even The Fly.In this way, Cronenberg fans may be disappointed by the calm style of Crash, including a virtually happy ending (!) Crash certainly is less painful to view than many of his films. The film-making is great. A relaxed enjoyable pace allows a sleazy narcotic ambiance, almost as if Cronenberg had conceived his own idea of a better made, stylish ""9 and a half Weeks"" but done to his palate, with his twisted tools.I was amused by the film for its easiness to watch. A drifting mad movie, with James Spader looking excellent, walking through a very well made film by a unique director. The James Dean scene will be a classic one day, as will other scenes. The negativity about this film seems somewhat silly. It is just another valuable Cronenberg production, of a piece with his fantastic, often disturbing catalogue.

199,symph0natic,One of the very worst movies I have ever seen.,1,9 January 2007,"I just saw this utter piece of crap on HBO. Yes, it was the fully uncensored NC-17 version. My partner had recorded it for me just to show me how bad it was. He was correct.While my feelings about it are not quite as strong as his (he says that everyone associated with it should have been shot), I came on here hoping to find an average rating of no higher than 4.0. I cannot believe that it has gotten an average rating of 5.9! The fact that more than ten percent rated it a 10, and another ten percent or so rated it a 9, shows that there are some really sick and disturbed people in the IMDb community. Much worse than that, though, that means that there are this many people out here that obviously have no discriminating taste in films.Being gay and a proud liberal Democrat, I consider myself to be very open-minded, especially when it comes to art, literature and film, but the fact is that this movie is crap. It is well-made in some scenes; however, that means that it is just fairly well-made crap! I know, David Cronenberg really made a film about sexual obsession in general, using sex and something completely unrelated to do so, yadda yadda yadda. Other than that, IMDb Community, what the *beep* was the point of making this? My well-considered answer: there was none.For one thing, all of the main characters are sick, uninteresting people. They get off on being involved in car crashes. In fact, this entire film is like a car crash: you watch it for morbid curiosity's sake, but you eventually want to turn away. I didn't turn away; no, I made sure that I watched it through to the end. But I kept wanting to turn away from about the 40-minute point. I know that Rosanna Arquette pretty much had no career at this point and needed whatever paltry salary she got for doing it. But what the hell was Holly Hunter thinking??? She had just won the Best Actress Oscar for The Piano just three years earlier! Just like my partner, I would not dissuade anyone who REALLY wanted to see Crash (1996). However, be forewarned.

I found myself in preparation of vomiting each second the story progressed. And the graphic sex scenes only got worse. The sex is relentless, and the people involved in the sex are unattractive. I wanted so badly to turn this movie off, and I wish I did, but I figured I had to finish it.I found myself scarred after seeing this, and found that I learned nothing from it.

Writing about drugs / gambling etc is always going to seem either didactic or as glorification but by using the same principles and applying them to a scenario which is patently absurd, you are able to better see the bizarre logic at work in the mind of an addict.

Note that if you want to see some hot scenes you should watch ""specualized movies"" not this.Add to this an ultra stressful music in the background, dark ambient and a relative slowness of the movie and you get somthing useless and boring.I heard that Cronenberg had planned to realise this movie earlier than 1996 but this wasn't possible at that time.

204,chainsaw massacre,A Masterpiece (contains spoilers),10,9 February 2000,"The first time I watched Crash was at 1 am in the morning as I had missed the first screening, I had already read reviews into the film and am a big David Cronenberg fan, but to my surprise the reviews that I had read about Crash considering it's controversial status were positive ones.So, onto the movie..what can I say...Crash is a masterpiece, a true, emotional, psychological powerhouse of a film, yet portrayed with minamalistic action or huge dialogue.The first thing that strikes to the mind is, is this a porn movie? The answer is ""no"", because you only have to observe the characters faces during sex to understand this....Cronenberg has portrayed sex as a meaningless, everyday act by which brings no satisfaction. This is also the reason why both Ballard and Catherine are trying out other people, in hope that something can come of a poor sexlife.Do the character's become perverts? No again, it is sexual frustration that forces them to explore other sexual acts, a perfect scenario for the director who brought the first properly edited exploding head, mutated Jeff Goldblum into a Fly, had parasitic humans turn the world into an apocalypse and make James Wood stick a gun into a vaginal wound in his stomach! ..but what these new cravings become merely is an eye-opener, nothing they do truly satisfies them. ""Maybe the next one, darling...Maybe the next one..."" James utters to Catherine at the end of the film after what should be there car crash that fuses them together, but merely fails to deliver and reinforces frustration.On the surface the characters seem shallow, but they are all conclusions of a failed destiny. Vaughan seems to crave violent car crashes, and is trying to expand his mind using famous people (James Dean/Jayne Mansfield) but no crash seems big enough, or powerful enough for satisfaction, he is a guy so destined to make the ultimate crash happen that it is only the end of the movie he realises that that full on buzz can only come from the death of himself.All the characters in this movie were cast perfectly from Rosanna Arquette (Gabrielle) to Peter MacNeil (Seagrave). To me the characters seem meaningless and insignificant in there existence of life, yet they are the foundations of society once you get past everything that is fun and happy, and that is what makes Crash so dark and disturbing, how far will people go for the things they crave so much!

It's all about people being bored in this modern world while really it's about loosing humanity due to this modern world. Is there anything else to do in order to feel ? Enjoy ? Lust ? Must it really hurt ? Is the pain really the ultimate JOY ? The story left me thinking about Humans - what is going on with the world? And isn't that sometimes the point ? Not just eating junk food while 'entertaining' yourself inside the theater ? But actually remembering the Movie for a long time and having the right to your own opinion and own happiness ? And that's the story, really. And the reason I write this comment so late is I saw the IMDb rating (5.9) while searching for stuff about Holly Hunter and I definitely think it's a 10.

211,titanDM_02,Controversy and quality are not equal,8,1 August 2005,"I remember this movie being released back when I was a wee lad, and all the controversy surrounding it, especially the infamous ""vagina scar,"" and thinking to myself, ""Holy *beep* that movie's gotta be nuts. I'm totally seeing that one day."" So here I am, with my fancy college degree, so many years later, having just finished viewing the film. And yes, it was totally friggin' nuts.It's incredibly well directed, superbly acted (except for Deborah Kara Unger, who barely moves her lips the whole damn movie... oops, I meant to say she barely moves her UPPER LIPS, b/c the 2nd set gets a workout in this flick... more on her later, though), and overall, not a total waste of time by any means. Elias Koteas, Holly Hunter, and Patricia Arquette were appropriately creepy, although the only reason I can think of that Holly's name gets billing over the other two is her marketability during that era of Hollywood. She's in like... ummm 10 minutes? So. I'm thinking to myself, really, no one could possibly go into this movie thinking it's going to be a good time. If someone said, to the average moviegoer, ""Hey, wanna see a movie that explores the link between sex and car crashes, and along the way eroticizes death and scarring???"" he or she would probably get a negative response. Not that such movies aren't valid or shouldn't be made, mind you, it's just that I can't see how anyone expected to get a whole lot of respect or money for putting a freakish amalgam of T&A and twisted metal, with a dash of homo-eroticism, on the screen.I get the point. It's actually kind of eloquent and well thought... but the necessity to film it somewhat eludes me. I didn't hate it, but I didn't love it.And onto the hot mess that was Deborah Kara Unger. She registered like .032 on the charisma scale. She freaking looked like a sleeping cat. And if my agent ever were to tell me that it was a good idea to do a film with a monologue like her tirade about penises and semen, I'd fire him or her, on the spot. That was just total crap... but I don't entirely blame her. I'm not sure there was much you could do with that turkey of a speech right there. I kept wanting James Spader to smack her and say, ""B*tch, you are SO ruining my mood."" But I mean, hey, look how HER career took off after this blockbuster. Who the hell am I to talk? Anyway, I guess my point is, that there IS no point to the controversy surrounding this movie. Sure, there's a copious amount of chick parts, some guy on guy and girl on girl action, but it's nothing you're not going to see on the Real World on any given day. It's worth it if you want to check out a controversial and well made film, but other than that, I don't see the point.

Burroughs fanatic).Likewise with Crash, a movie that will have you saying 'what the hell was that all about?' for the rest of the day after watching it, unless you already dig the psychotic, proto-rivet-head literary musings of J.G. Ballard. Of course, if you do, then the film won't give you anything new, just provide eve candy to supplant a work you're already familiar with.If you're a fanboy of the dementedly surreal and Cronenberg's perversely postmodern take on social commentary, you'll probably end up with this in the film library; if not, you'll probably be demanding your rental fees back.In a nutshell: like much of Cronenberg's stuff - not guaranteed to make sense to anyone but Cronenberg himself, caveat emptor.",Crash
214,jarrellfisher,Psychoanalysis and the unconscious in Crash is the key,10,30 August 2005,"I think this reviewer and the virtually all those who reviewed this film in the press entirely missed the obvious. First, this film is clearly mixing around with the psychoanalytic themes surrounding ""Eros"" and ""Thanatos"", or in other words death and sex.Second, this movie is a commentary on our obsession with cars. We treat cars as sexual objects, we fetish them all the time.I can't understand the perspective that the characters in this film are not realistic, or are freaks, etc... when has realism ever been an issue when watching a movie?The narrative in this film is clear, and the storyline is easy to understand. When the character Vaughn is talking about James Dean and racing to death, he is clearly stating a popular view. We do treat James Dean as a sexual icon of manhood, and we do glorify his death.So why do people hate this movie so much?Well when someone goes into see a shrink and they end up hating the shrink we usually call the transference. My theory is that this film starts to bring to consciousness all these unconscious drives. For example the latent homosexuality in the love of the movie star and the automobile.The reviewer says the films obsession with cars could be replaced with any other sexual obsession.

218,Glaurung (academic dragon),An anti-erotic exploration of the hollowness of modern life,10,13 December 1999,"Crash is a very sexually explicit film, but if you buy or rent this movie expecting it to be an evening's erotic entertainment, you are going to be disappointed, because it is also an anti-erotic film.Even in the midst of frenzied lovemaking, the characters remain distant, their voices quiet and abstracted, their gazes directed inward.  These are people who have been told all their lives by their culture, by TV and movies, that sex is, on the one hand, the most perfect form of communion and connection with another human being; and, on the other hand, that it is the ultimate in transcendent and transformative experiences.  Instead, they discover to their horror that even during sex they still feel nothing. They crave connection, they are starved for a glimpse of transcendence, but no matter what they do, no matter who they do it with or how often, while their bodies may feel passion, their minds and hearts remain cold and empty.
In the more recent movie Pleasantville, the Jennifer/Mary Sue character is unable to feel anything either, and remains stubbornly black and white no matter how much sex she has, until her brother suggests that ""maybe it isn't the sex"" that is the key to moving from black and white to color, from passionlessness to feeling.  Unfortunately, in Crash, there is no one to suggest to David and Catherine Ballard that maybe it isn't through sex that they will find the transformation and connection they are craving.  So they instead seek more and more extreme forms of sexual stimulation, only to be disappointed again and again.James is hurt in a car crash, and during his stay in the hospital he meets Helen (who was in the other car) and later Vaughan, a man who like James and Catherine is in desperate search of feeling, only he looks for it in the violence of car crashes.  With Helen, at first James, then Catherine too is drawn into Vaughan's world, where sex and death (eros and thanatos for you Freudians) meet in the twisted metal of wrecked cars and the mutilated bodies of the victims of fatal car crashes and the survivors of near-fatal ones.They attend staged recreations of famous car crashes, like the one that killed James Dean.  They have sex in crashed cars, and start touring crash sites on the freeway as a form of foreplay. They begin to watch films of crash tests and fatal race accidents like other people would watch erotic films, and to have sex with people whose bodies have been mutilated by car crashes.But not even the horror of mutilation or the adrenaline rush of near-death experience can lend James and Catherine's desperate coupling the depth of feeling that they so desperately crave.Like all the people who buy expensive automobiles to give them a feeling of power and independence, only to discover that no matter how snazzy their car is, they still feel powerless and unhappy, James and Catherine have bought into one of our culture's Big Lies, that sex is the answer.  This film shows us that it is not.",Crash

224,derekpond1962,A Brilliant Analysis of Our Relationship with Technology,9,20 January 2006,"In 1996, Crash (1996, Cronenberg) won The Jury Special Prize at Cannes. However, this proved to be a rare positive response. In other quarters, the picture was almost universally loathed and condemned as perverted and repulsive. Westminster Council in London banned it outright. The Daily Mail and Evening Standard in particular saw the film as threatening to public morals, criticising it regularly, often on their front pages. Christopher Tookey, writing in The Daily Mail, caused outrage amongst the disabled lobby by using the phrase 'sex with cripples'. This seems to have caused more offence than by anything in the film. Alexander Walker described Crash as ""a movie beyond the bounds of depravity."" So what's really been going on? Crash is David Cronenberg's third masterpiece. However, unlike Videodrome and Naked Lunch there is no confusion between reality and hallucination. The protagonists actually engage in even the more extreme behaviours in Crash. The characters engage in seemingly random acts of dangerous driving, crashing cars and sex but there is more to Crash than ""sex and wrecks"". The film is also a deeply disturbing analysis of the interplay between these obsessions in the lives of a group of emotionally damaged people.Crash is a movie about unsatisfying relationships, in particular the flawed relationships between the main characters. The empty relationship between Catherine and James Ballard; the strange relationship between the protagonists and their cars; and the tortured relationships between the characters and their body modifications (crash injuries).Vaughn's relationship with his car is extremely personal  he lives in it and ""f**ks"" in it. His car is described by Catherine as a ""bed on wheels"". Ballard tells his wife that it ""smells of semen"". Crash asks us: what relationship do we have with our vehicles? Is it our mobile office? Or is it perhaps our refuge from reality, a place of safety and seclusion when we want to be alone? Are we relieved when we are able to escape from daily pressures into the safety of that mobile metal womb? With reference to Crash, Cronenberg has remarked: ""A car is not the highest of high tech. But it has affected us and changed us more than anything else in the last hundred years. We have incorporated it. The weird privacy in public that it gives us. The sexual freedom  which in the '50s wasn't even subtle! So we have already incorporated the car into our understanding of time, space, distance and sexuality. To want to merge with it literally in a more physical way seems a good metaphor. There is a desire to fuse with techno-ness."" The sex in Crash is mundane and boring, a joyless experience for all involved (""Did you come?"" asks James of his wife as she tells him about her latest conquest. ""No"", she replies.) The participants seem distracted, cold and distant. They rarely even face one another during sex, with the action being mostly from behind. The characters seem distracted, looking off into the distance, their eyes dead and empty, such as when James and Catherine have sex and discuss Vaughn. There is a third person involved in their actions.The cars end up as twisted and damaged as the people involved. The wreckage that Vaughn and company leave behind symbolises the wrecked and soulless relationships they have with each other. After a crash, the driver and passengers are removed, effectively removing the car's beating heart. Vaughn and his companions inject temporary new life into the wrecks by reclaiming them, either as drivers or as a place to have sex in. Conversely, the broken and smashed vehicles seem to give life to their new inhabitants, who only seem to be really alive and able to connect with their feelings when they are either behind a wheel or having sex in the back.As an uncompromising comment upon how our lives and behaviour have been affected and altered by modern technology, Crash is exceptional in its bravery and honesty. The film's characters find their bodies being altered and twisted by modern science in the form of cars. Advancing technology, Cronenberg tells us, alters us, and will continue to do so as it becomes more integrated into our lives and our personal and collective consciousnesses. Our world, our behaviour and our bodies will continue to change as technology invades our flesh and our minds.These themes of metamorphosis, mutation and 'treacherous flesh' have been explored by Cronenberg in practically every one of his previous movies, perhaps most successfully in Videodrome (1982) and The Fly (1986). Videodrome considers the impact and influence of broadcast media on human behaviour and sexuality and implies that ""you can actually change what it means to be a human being in a physical way"" (Cronenberg, 1997). The Fly studies these same themes, but replaces technology with disease. The potential of illness to transform the physical shell is contrasted with the changes forced on our bodies by the aging process. ""We're used to our bodies changing. First we grow up, then we grow down. There's only a moment where there are a few years of the illusion of stability. It doesn't last long"" (Cronenberg, 1997) This singularity of vision confirms Cronenberg as an auteur with imagination, single-mindedness and power, as well as a disturbing new vision of the world. Indeed, 'Cronenberg-esque' has become a term describing a specific and unique genre, one that is unlike any other associated with typical horror cinema.",Crash

What next time? Suicide is understandable, even cutting oneself I can understand but wanting to be injured in a car accident is sick beyond anything I have seen before.",Crash
237,doran-5,Freaky and worthwhile even if it sickens you,9,13 April 2006,"James Spader seems to prefer roles in which his sexuality is dark or deviant (e.g. Secretary, a fine film). He and the gorgeous Deborah Kay Unger are a couple, although not monogamous. Through certain accidents they stumble across a cell of car crash fetishists. More stuff happens: I shouldn't get into it. This movie would have been more disturbing if it didn't have such a sense of humor. There is a nasty scene in which Spader is about to rub his willie against a long puckered vagina-like scar on the luscious Roseanna Arquette's leg. She wears an outfit that is a combination of leather bondage gear and handicapped leg braces. A truly weird flick, with good sex scenes but not for a first date unless the girl likes SM and looks at copies of that full-color British magazine featuring motorcycle racing showing the racers proudly displaying their often horrid scars and injuries. Yikes. Well, if you liked Secretary, and if you liked Cronenberg's other flicks and his orifice obsession and general grotesqueness, you'll like this. It has a similar tone vis-a-vis humor as Secretary and some of Videodrome. The title credits are exemplary and some of the shots are marvelous. The scene wherein the camera lovingly rolls over Spader's leg brace after his accident is stunning. I am happy to say that there is no amputation in this flick at least. That would have been too much.",Crash
238,toddymph,Crash mix-up from on high,1,18 June 2006,"I had my DVR record Crash from Cinemax or something and I decided to watch it a few weeks later. I am watching the first half and I can't see how this trash won any awards. I check the description ever now and again (sadly, as if the DVR would realize its mistake and correct) to make sure I am watching the movie I thought. The network provided description is for the 2005 version, not this shop-class porno.Eventually, (after wasting 45 minutes of my life) I came to IMDb which cleared the whole thing up.So don't feel bad if you mixed up the movies, the networks can't seem to keep them straight either.",Crash
239,MrBump,A-Hoy all you twisted freaks!,1,9 March 2006,"If you pick off your scabs while whacking yourself into a frenzy then this is the film for you.Decapitations to cause arousal? Shagging scars? Who thought up this rubbish? Never in my life have i been more freaked out by the idea that people will actually get off to this rubbish. James Spader, what were you thinking? Now, you're not just a crap actor but a pervert too! How does a producer approach you with this idea? Have to go, i've just fallen off my computer chair and my dog wants to lick my elbow. Great! DON'T WATCH THIS. AWFUL AWFUL AWFUL!",Crash
