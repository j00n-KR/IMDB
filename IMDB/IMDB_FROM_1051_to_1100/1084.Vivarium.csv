0,SnoopyStyle,strange nightmare,6,20 May 2020,"School teacher Gemma (Imogen Poots) and Tom (Jesse Eisenberg) are a happy couple. All they want is a house to call their own. They are led by peculiar salesman Martin to a strange subdivision. Every house looks the same. The sky is artificial. They cannot escape. They find a box full of supplies. After trying to burn down the house, they find a baby boy in a box.This is a Twilight Zone episode stretched out into a movie. It is interesting visually. After the weird premise, the story does not really pick up. I also hate the screaming child. It's very annoying. What the movie needs is a series of scenes where the couple is trying stuff. There should be a montage of them trying to escape. They should be tearing through the houses. I appreciate digging the hole but it's not an exciting activity. The ending does have an exciting chase down a rabbit hole. That saves the movie for me. This is puzzle that ends where it begins with no particular message.",Vivarium
1,kosmasp,Endless,8,8 February 2020,"Some things are way too good to be true. And sometimes you might find yourself in a situation that you are not going to be able to escape from (no pun intended). Having said that the movie asks you to suspend your disbelief. If you can do that this is quite the nice movie, with a lot of social and general human commentary. What is expected of us, what we expect from us and what life can be about - or rather what we make of it.Is it all for nothing? Are we moving forward, are we creating, are we actually changing anything? All things that can be seen here, if one wants to see them. And more, while this is slow burning, it also is quite classy. That will not make it better for those who will be bored with it all, but those who will cherish it, will love it too",Vivarium
2,LeonLouisRicci,A TWILIGHT ZONE EXPERIENCE CONTAINING CREEPY MINIMALISM IN A VERY TENSE FAMILY WAY,7,2 September 2021,"Self-Contained Little Movie that is Bound to the ""Home"" and the Neighborhood.There is No Escape for the House-Hunting Couple Abducted by Aliens.It Contains just a Trio of Characters.Played by Imogen Poots, Jesse Eisenberg, and Johnathan Aris with Support from Youngsters Senan Jennings and Eanna Hardwick.It's Played to the Limit and then some.The Story Pushes the Limits with Substantial Psychologically Inate Suspense and Tension.A Tense Irish Production that Doesn't Have Much Breathing Room.The Atmosphere is Suffocating and Atrophied.An Exaggerated Example of a Suburbia from Hell.Empty Domiciles Void of Life as We Know it with Adjacent ""Lawns"" that make Astro-Turf seem Organic.The Nightmare is Embraced by the Couple, sort of, as the Forced Domesticity and Parenting becomes Unbearable for Them and the Audience.The Film's Simplicity and Super Torment may Not be for All.But if You are Willing to Visit this Doomed Domicile and its Forced Family, Prepare for a Punishing Experience.",Vivarium
3,CinemaSerf,Corporium...,5,25 April 2020,"A young couple go to an estate agent to seek out their dream home. They encounter the almost robotic ""Martin"" who offers to show them their ideal residence - and so off go Imogen Poots and Jesse Eisenberg to inspect. They discover a typical detached house in the suburbs, surrounded by identical homes that leave them a bit cold. When their guide disappears, they decide to go home - except; they are caught in a labyrinthine network of streets that always brings them back to ""No. 9"". Soon, a baby in a box arrives and their happiness ought to be complete - except they have no other human contact and so slowly, but surely, start to go a bid mad. The kid has an infuriating habit of screaming loudly when he doesn't get what he wants - and I felt much like screaming myself as the cyclical pointlessness of this really dreary film did start to get on my nerves. Perhaps Lorcan Finnegan intended the potency of the sterility of the whole thing to engender a feeling of irritation from his audience; if he did then top marks. Otherwise, this is a total waste of the talents of two actors who could have found better ways to help us pass 100 minutes.",Vivarium
4,deloudelouvain,Bizarre but strangely good.,7,27 April 2020,"I thought Vivarium was a nice surprise from a movie I didn't expect much of. The story is completely refreshing, i can't recall watching another movie with a similar story so that's already a positive point. There are too much movies with repetitive stories so to see one with an interesting plot it gets my attention. It's a weird story, so if you don't like the bizarre (that's those with the negative reviews) then you should just not watch it, you will be disappointed. Vivarium is the kind of movie that makes me talk out loud during the viewing, what I would do if I was in that case and so on. The plot is intriguing, the decor very minimalistic but that definitely adds to the odd ambiance, the cast is very small but good. Once you're in the story you defintely want to know what the hell is happening and where they are going to? Maybe the end could have been a bit more elaborated but overal it's a movie that deserves a better rating, just for creativity alone.",Vivarium
5,siderite,A weird little play-like movie that makes you think of much more things than the creators did,7,30 April 2020,"There is a style of movie that involves very few characters in a very simple story, but that is explored in more detail because of its simplicity. It makes you think of possibilities and of hidden meaning. This is such a movie and while the writers and directors thought of some things when creating the story, like the cuckoo and the parasitic nature of capitalism, people watching it will undoubtedly find other interpretations. This is either a sign of a brilliant film or of one so stupid that people don't believe it was just that.To me, it was a fast forward through the story of a couple that want a child and a simple life, then realize what a horrible mistake they've made when that child sucks the life out of them and moves on without a care. But that's just me. The creators admit this is an extended version of an idea they had when they were making a short, so if you feel it takes to long to get anywhere it's also because of that and not only because you are an information junkie trapped in your own little tasteless world.Bottom line: it kind of pulls you in and keeps the tension going, mainly through the actors doing a very good job expressing the emotions of the trapped couple. However, it felt longer than it had to be and less than it might have been.",Vivarium
6,cherold,intriguing and well made but not entirely satisfying,6,15 May 2020,"Vivarium is a rather ingenious film about a young couple, excellently played by Imogen Poots and Jesse Eisenberg, lured to a bland housing development by a salesman (a hilariously weird Jonathan Aris) where they are forced to raise a child. I really liked the first half, which is a visually striking, surreal existential drama that can be seen as a commentary on suburban life.At first much of the movie is weirdly, darkly comical, but as it moves along the comical parts give way to despair and horror. This makes sense, and I think it's a reasonable direction for the movie to go based on its premise. But while the first half is *fun*, the second half is very much not, and that feels like a bit of a bait and switch.The movie is also, at an hour and a half, too long. It's basically an extended Twilight Zone episode that takes one concept and explores it. There aren't really twists per se, we never learn much about this world, we just see how these people's lives unfold in this bizarre situation.Ultimately I'm torn between rating this 6 or 7, since parts of it are quite good. But while I was fascinated early on, by the end I was just kinda bummed out.",Vivarium
7,Pjtaylor-96-138044,Talk about being stuck in a boring reality...,4,10 February 2021,"Though 'Vivarium (2019)' isn't necessarily a bad in-the-moment viewing experience, it ultimately emerges as a frustrating and almost pointless endeavour. It requires a lot of patience, as most slow-burning things do, but it doesn't reward that patience with anything other than its end credits. Most obviously, the movie is an incredibly cynical and downbeat allegory for the cyclical nature of - I suppose - 'typical' suburban life. It basically posits that life is nothing but a prison (cheerful, I know). The problem is that its metaphor falls short in a few key areas, most notably in how it connects itself to the 'true' surface-level aspects of the story. The actual machinations of its plot are so poorly defined that they lack any real relevance. Plus, in the real world, there's this little thing called happiness, which the flick seems to forget. Of course, movies are allowed to be dark. It's just that they ought to amount to something, to use their darkness as a way to frighten or provoke. Rather than using its nihilism to create fear, the piece just puts it on display. The actual story keeps going in circles. There aren't many twists on the central situation. Even when something new does crop up, the picture tends to bat its ideas aside in an effort to create an increasingly hopeless vibe. Essentially, it's plagued by long stretches where 'nothing' happens. Now, you could argue that's the point: its leads are stuck in infinite suburbia, after all. Just because the characters are bored, though, doesn't mean the audience has to be. The narrative is elusive and strange, an odd mixture of the mundane and the otherworldly, but it isn't intriguing. It really should be, too. The movie's premise and, even, some of its plot points have a lot of potential. That's why it's so frustrating that the whole thing just feels like a waste of time. It's well-made and, as I mentioned, it can hold your attention, but it's the sort of thing you almost regret giving your attention to. There's not much else to say, really. It's just not that good. Oh, and it features one of the most annoying children ever put to screen (through no fault of the actor); he's not freaky or unsettling, he's just plain irritating. 4/10",Vivarium
8,851222,"Bold, original and good",8,29 November 2020,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Vivarium"" (2019) is a one helluva original movie if you ask me. This is a brave movie in a sense that they don't usually make this kind of cinema. Like at the end of the movie I was trying to understand the whole idea I think I failed, yet I highly enjoyed this movie. The story here is kind of simple yet really original and fresh. Performance by those few actors who were in this movie were really good. And the premise kept me glued to the screen once I figure it out its plot - and I have to seen any trailers.Overall, ""Vivarium"" is a truly unique film which is safe to say not for everyone. Good and original story, very good acting and solid directing made this one of the more memorable movies watching experiences to me in some time.",Vivarium
9,westsideschl,Non-Sensical,2,15 June 2020,"This Danish/Belgium production would make a good sequel to ""Greener Grass"" by presenting us some other worldly (e.g. alien experimentation, or intersecting parallel Universes) possible rationale to the totally unrealistic events found in both movies. Or, more likely, the writers were once institutionalized from a psychotic delusional loss of reality (sorry, it's OK).
From the beginning a grade schooler would be asking why is this couple following some weird person into a community of thousands of identical houses w/no people in any of them? Not to be confused w/fantasy which requires imagination, and a coherent story. I FF through most & missed nothing.
Side-note on attention to detail; just a couple of examples: Facial appearance for Imogen & Jessie (e.g.stubble beard) doesn't change the entire time. Another, the dirt outside the hole he's digging is 1/100 the volume it should be.",Vivarium

11,Thanos_Alfie,This is not art...,3,2 August 2020,"""Vivarium"" is a Mystery - Horror movie in which we watch a couple going to see a new house in a strange place. Soon they realize that all the houses are identical, they are trapped there and they cannot leave.I have to admit that I expected something completely different from this movie and I was disappointed by it. Many people consider this movie a definition of art, I disagree and I believe that art does not have to be so pretentious in order to present the same principles, differences between genres in family and problems of today's society. Some other movies which were far better than this one already presented the same in a better way. Finally, I do not recommend anyone to watch this movie because it's just a movie that wants to be considered artistic and nothing more. It does not have much to offer or even something new, do not waste your time watching it.",Vivarium
12,cruise01,"Strange, weird, and does leave you wondering about the message.",7,15 May 2020,"Vivarium (3.5 out of 5 stars).Vivarium is a pretty fair science fiction thriller film that is weird and strange. Without giving away much spoilers while discussing this film. The plot starts out simple. About a young couple Tom (Jesse Eisenberg) and Gemma (Imogen Poots) who meet a strange realtor name Martin. Who plans to show them this new development of houses. They travel to this new development. Almost looking like a baby boomer theme of big houses. All looking the same. Plain neighborhood. And it seems to be quiet with only Tom and Gemma visiting. The realtor disappears leaving them in the house. They try to leave the neighborhood. After driving the whole day with them driving in a loop and can not seem to find an exit. They try to walk through the fences to get out of the maze and they keep coming across the house they were looking at. Then, a mysterious baby boy with a note on it that says raise the boy and you will be released. It is only a matter of time they lose their minds of the isolation and trying to figure out this mystery.The plot is good. I was intrigued with the movie. It has a few layers of mystery. Such as the purpose of them being trapped? The theme of cycle of life. And is there other forces out there? The film is strange. The baby the couple raises gets weird through every scene. The kid becomes obnoxious and annoying with his behavior. Driving the couple to losing their minds. The film does reach a moment where it may leave you in a shocked reaction of what is going on. And the climax and ending does feel a little short like they lost the desire to continue to explore further with the ideas of the mystery the film starts out with. I did find the ending to be a little weak.Jesse Eisenberg is great. Imogen Poots is also wonderful. The movie is a great mystery concept with a hidden message which many audiences may have different perspectives on what they think about the theme of the story. I did find the ideas being wasted in the third act of the movie which does leave you feeling ahhh until it is over. And you are left wondering with questions.",Vivarium
13,eddie_baggins,Undoubtedly unique but also detrimentally boring and vague,2,16 August 2020,"Unquestionably unique, with director Lorcan Finnegan molding together drama, horror, mystery and sci-fi around a film that could be taken as either a straight up analogy of modern suburban living or a Lovecraft inspired horror, Vivarium is also a chore to sit through, as initial intrigue gives way to tedium well before the half way mark of this 90 minute affair.Set almost entirely in a Tim Burton like neighborhood of houses as Jesse Eisenberg's charisma free school gardener Tom and his teacher girlfriend Gemma (the always good Imogen Poots) find themselves trapped in a house they came to inspect, as well as put in charge of a strange child that appears on their front door, Finnegan's intently odd feature length film has the bones of a truly gripping original piece of cinema that on execution here would've been far better suited to an episode of The Twilight Zone or Black Mirror.Everything in Vivarium feels half explored at best, with the insistence of Finnegan's effort to answer few if any of the questions we begin to have about what on earth is happening to Tom and Gemma and who is behind it quickly giving way to frustration, as we like the couple get stuck in and endless loop of happenings and going's on that are akin to going about chores around the house.Compounding the films frustrating lack of giving us anything to chew on rather than our own thoughts and theory's is the fact that with so much time spent solely with Tom and Gemma, they remain throughout mostly cold and empty figures in this bizarre tale.Outside of some very early set-up that shows Gemma is clearly the more motivated of the two and that the two enjoy some good old fashioned reggae music, Eisenberg and Poots get little to build upon in their respective roles that would've made our rather boring narrative alongside them work in a more sustainable manner as we endure their quest to try and understand the mess they find themselves in.Throughout the film are little glimmers of the movie that could've been, the young boy the two are in charge of is an at times mightily unnerving creation and some questions the film raises are worth exploring but it never helps the fact that Vivarium runs out of gas far too early and arguably never had the destination worth the trip anyway.Final Say -A disappointing offering that at the very least is incomparable to any other film before it, Vivarium has the bones of something great but this is akin to a house inspection your best off avoiding at all costs.1 high decibel breakfast time out of 5",Vivarium
14,Tweetienator,More or Less Your Standard Mystery Story,5,30 March 2020,"Pro: nice performances by Imogen Poots and Jesse Eisenberg (also the actors of the kid did well), nice visual style, good production and execution, also the concept/idea is a good one.
Con: nothing in this story will really surprise you (digging a hole, hoho), somewhat a nice twist or a deeper meaning or should I say the whereto the story aims for conclusion is heavily missed (the resolution is one that lacks real creativity, its a rather obvious choice). I also agree with those reviewers who state that Vivarium could be cut down to an episode of a mystery show of 45 to 60 minutes. All in all Vivarium is a solid and entertaining affair but also a missed opportunity to make something really interesting and good.",Vivarium

LOL, they run out of gas then try to walk their way out, eventually they end up right back at their OWN HOUSE!+1 Star because that's just funnySo they decide to set the house on fire and watch it burn. Of course they fall asleep. When they wake up, they find a baby in a box in front of them. It's a Boy.Oh and also the House is back as it was, intact. So fire damage? Weird. So either something supernatural is happening or they were asleep for a very very long time while that house was rebuilt.Wait what?? The boy is now liek 10 to 12 years old and talks in Man and Woman's voices? I seem to have missed a lot. Oh they have days written on the wall where they measure him, and it said like 74 days So in 74 days the kid has grown 'like a dog' they say, haha.So they finally have some sex.

Woman of course doesn't listen and rescues IT from the car and brings IT back into the House.Man keeps digging this hole in the front yard. He is convinced something is down there. And he heard something down there while he was digging. And it is pretty clear at this point Woman has lost it.

Then IT puts gas in the car and drives back to the real world, where he finds a rapidly Aged Martin in his office for YONDER! Well lookie there, IT is Martins replacement. And he is just in time to put Martin in a bag and take over his position selling properties for YONDER to unsuspecting couples.Nice ONE!

17,jtindahouse,A unique and creepy character study,8,28 March 2020,"I'm a big fan of films like 'Vivarium'. I love the mystery behind everything. It means you're never sure what is around the corner and you are in the same boat as the characters where everything is new and confusing. I also like these types of movies because it gives the characters so much room to wiggle in. How screenwriters portray their characters reaction to this scenario is crucial. 'Vivarium' does a really good job of this. Both of the lead characters are fascinating to watch as they handle the situation in their own unique ways. While it may not have stuck the landing as well as I would've hoped, this is still a very good film.The scenes before the events begin to happen in this film are crucial, where we meet our main characters and see what they are like in normal life. Imogen Poots and Jesse Eisenberg had a surprising amount of chemistry. Their acting skills are on full display throughout the film in fact. Poots in particular impressed me. She is a very watchable young actress. I also loved how creepy the film seemed capable of making a character. Both 'Martin' early in the film and also the young child that is in the film for a long period were crafted really well in that respect.The film's let-down is probably the ending. I don't envy the screenwriter's job of having to tie it all up nicely into a bow. Interestingly the ending he went with was an exact scenario that I ran through my mind as being the ending early in the film, not that I'm calling the film predictable, just that it made sense. The film doesn't outstay its welcome though and knows when to wrap things up. I enjoyed 'Vivarium' a lot and would recommend it.",Vivarium

20,cekadah,Sell the dream,9,15 April 2020,For me the key to understanding and appreciating this film rest in the character of the real estate agent. His task isn't so much in selling the house but he must also sell the dream of suburban living. Our couple decide they do not want the life style the agent is selling.

22,kluseba,"Gemma, Tom & Woof-Woof",6,3 June 2020,"''Tom!''''Tom!!''''Tom!!!''''Gemma...''''Tom?''''Gemma...''Vivarium is an experimental science-fiction film that looks like a mixture of Suburbicon with its lush settings and weird characters and an extended Black Mirror episode with its dystopian vibes and surprising conclusions. The story revolves around a young couple that is looking for a house. The warmhearted school teacher and the sarcastic gardener meet with a strange realtor named Martin. He makes them visit a house at Yonder, a brand-new suburban community. The weird realtor mysteriously disappears during the visit and the couple decides to leave. However, they soon realize that they are trapped and unable to leave the community. They try to walk away, drive away and even burn their house but they always end up returning to house number nine. One day, they receive a package with a baby boy. A message tells them that they will be released once they have raised the baby. It soon becomes obvious that there is something amiss about the boy. He only repeats things his foster parents have told him, is unable to dream and imagine things and seems to be meeting a mysterious stranger in the abandoned community. The foster parents try to find out about the boy's secrets but the isolation slowly takes its toll on their physical and mental well-being. Will they be able to find out what's going on and make it out of the community alive?This science-fiction movie has a few positive elements. The story isn't completely new but intriguing and mysterious enough to keep you guessing until the end. The settings are particularly colourful and lush. The deterioration of the two main characters is fascinating to watch as is the rapid development of their adopted son. The soundtrack is diversified and vibrant. The surreal special effects are scarcely employed but integrated with care.The movie however also has a few downsides. Its pace is at times excruciatingly slow despite a rather compact running time. The deterioration of the main characters feels a little bit rushed. This is the case for Imogen Poots' character in particular. The dialogues, like the one written above, are at times repetitive, shallow and unintentionally funny. The movie's conclusion isn't bad but one could have expected something more surprising after a build-up that took eighty minutes.In the end, I would recommend Vivarium to fans of arthouse cinema and dystopian stories. You should like this film if you value atmosphere over pace. The film's main idea is intriguing but the concept could have been materialized with more charisma and wit.",Vivarium
23,Pairic,Satire-Horror,7,3 August 2020,"Vivarium: A strange horror satire which basically portrays real estate agents as parasites. Something like an idea thought up by Ballard and fleshed out by Philip K. Dick. A couple, Gemma (Imogen Poots) and Tom (Jesse Eisenberg) are brought by a creepy agent to a new housing development, Yonder. The agent disappears and the hapless duo find that they cannot escape from the Yonder either by car or on foot. Seemingly endless rows of identical green houses, a sky dotted with cotton wool style clouds and they are trapped in number nine. Food arrives in boxes when they are asleep, then a baby is delivered in a box with a promise that they will be released if they raise it. The boy grows rapidly, after 98 days he is about 8 years old. He is quite literally a little monster and the couple deal with the strangeness in their own ways. Tom literally digging himself into a hole and Gemma alternating between hating the boy and becoming his stepmother. Most of the horror is prosaic, gradually building up to an existential sense of panic as the months go by. There are some shocking scenes though and while not everything makes sense on a surface level there are hidden layers to this story. Good acting by Poot and Eisenberg but the standout performance is by Senan Jennings as the boy. Director/Co-writer Lorcan Finnegan delivers an interesting tale of terror. 7/10.",Vivarium
24,peterp-450-298716,I thought it was intriguing. I guess I'm one of the few who thinks that.,6,10 April 2020,"Near enough.
And far enough.
Just the right distance.During this Corona crisis, watching a movie was an impossible task for me. Let alone that I could write down a sensible word to form an opinion. But now three weeks later, the urge to watch a movie once again came back. And I could focus on the movie without my mind wandering off to some disaster scenarios. Apparently, my doom thinking disappeared. And hurray. Even the traditional formulation of an opinion was possible again. Only the choice of film was a bit unfortunate. ""Vivarium"" isn't exactly a movie that'll make you happy. It has many similarities with the situation people in the world are in today. Isolated and tied to one specific living space. No contact with others. And a feeling of powerlessness, fear, and despair. However, it's not a deadly virus why Gemma (Imogen ""Green Room"" Poots) and Tom (Jesse ""The Social Network"" Eisenberg) are in this situation.Let me warn you first. ""Vivarium"" isn't exactly an everyday film. It's very confusing and probably boring to some. Not only because of the painfully slow pace. But also because of the repetitive character of the film. And mainly, because of the completely surreal and absurd theme of this film. To be honest, from the start I had the feeling that I was looking at a surreal painting by Margritte. Those artificial, unnatural looking perfect clouds against a clear blue sky. The identical row houses in a distasteful green color. Everything looks artificial and unreal. As insignificant and abstract as the name of the neighborhood itself: ""Yonder"".Gemma and Tom, a young couple that wants to settle down and are looking for an affordable home, end up at a real estate agency one day. The eerie-sounding and unworldly-reacting real estate agent invites them to visit a house in a suburb that's just been built. At first sight a well-kept neighborhood. But at the same time a frightening neighborhood where all houses and gardens look identical. While Gemma and Tom visit the house, with house number 9, they've actually made a decision already. While viewing the nursery, bright blue and therefore already intended as a boys' room, they suddenly realize that the real estate agent Martin (Jonathan Aris) has vanished into thin air. And after a while they discover that they're not getting out of this maze of identical houses in any way. They have to accept that they are forever trapped in this artificial world.From then on, ""Vivarium"" becomes an uncomfortable film. As a viewer, you feel the despair and watch the youthful and lively couple evolve into an apathetic and indifferent duo whose daily routine consists of eating tasteless astronaut food and caring for a bizarre child. They found the boy at their front door in a cardboard box. Raising this child would be an opportunity to escape, as the message reads on the box. Only this toddler creates a conflict between Gemma and Tom. Not only does the boy's behavior create tension. Their relationship with this strange little boy is also different. The little fellow seems to be not of this world, as well. His growth pattern isn't normal. His behavior and way of communicating (he speaks with the voice of Gemma and Tom) are both absurd and annoying. The psychotic shouting until he gets his way would make me go ballistic for sure. And that's how Tom responds. While Gemma, as a kindergarten teacher, creates a stronger bond with the nasty little boy, Tom reacts hostile and turns to digging a bottomless pit. Probably to find a way out.Don't expect a conclusive explanation at the end of the movie. To be honest, there were as many open questions at the end of the movie as there were at the beginning. The final message was not really clear to me. Is it about the colorless and monotonous, routine life that some of us lead? Is it an indictment of our modernist and materialistic society? Or a satirical view of that society? Or are aliens using humanity to breed their species in an infinite cycle? Like the cuckoo at the beginning. Maybe I expected a little more. But in the end I thought ""Vivarium"" was an intriguing movie with an exceptional set-up, kind of unusual images and yet some admirable acting. In particular Imogen Poots left a lasting impression. However, I fear that not everyone will share the same opinion.",Vivarium
25,aidanratesmovies,And the Award for Most Original Film of 2020 goes to...,9,15 July 2020,"...Vivarium! Incredibly unique, often stunning, and full of all out performances- Vivarium gives a truly original glimpse into a new kind of horror, which may prove to be a bit formulaic at times, but is for the most part, absolutely groundbreaking. Vivarium is a very hard film to talk about. Experiencing it for myself, I hardly knew what to expect as the minutes passed by, and didn't entirely grasp the full measure of what had happened by the end. Needless to say though, I thoroughly enjoyed the film and felt a need to discuss its strengths and flaws. Vivariums biggest flaw I would have to say would be its mechanics of storytelling, with it seeming a bit overly formulaic towards the beginning (the set-up of the film) in order to get things started. However, eventually, Vivarium finds its own unique footing to carry itself throughout, and what remains from this truly original work is something oddly brilliant. Jesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots are very talented as always in their performances, but it's the minor roles in the film that truly make the movie as suspenseful and thrilling as it is. As I won't go much further into detail, I can say that all the cast, although it isn't very large, deserves credit for their work in the film. The atmosphere in the film conveyed fits absolutely perfectly, as well as the way it looks, feeling incredibly artificial and yet so menacingly real all at once. It's mind bending, interesting, entertaining, and quite stressful to watch in the very best of ways. Vivarium may ask more questions than it is able to answer, but I was blown away by the pure insaneness of this film, and I hope that director Lorcan Finnegan has more up his sleeve for future horror projects, because I honestly can't wait what he thinks of next.
My Rating: 9/10",Vivarium

Year: 2019
Director: Lorcan Finnegan
Writer: Garret Shanley
Starring: Imogen Poots, Jesse Eisenberg and Senan JenningsReview:This was a film that when the trailer was shown before quite a few movies that I saw with Jaime, I knew that I wanted to see it. With the pandemic and the Gateway Film Center being closed, I was bummed that I wouldn't get the chance to see this on the big screen. When I saw it was on VOD, I checked in with the lady to see if she was interested. We did give it a watch and I heard another podcast host briefly cover this as well. I've also given it a second viewing to see where it would land for my end of year list. The synopsis is a young couple looking for the perfect home find themselves trapped in a mysterious labyrinth-like neighborhood of identical houses.Now this movie has a creepy scene of seeing a bird's nest. There's one that is bigger than the others and it slowly pushes them out. We see that this bird grows to be larger than the mother that comes back.It then shifts to inside of a classroom. The teacher is Gemma (Imogen Poots) and the children are pretending to be trees as the wind blows around them. Outside, the children are being picked up by their parents and there's a young girl Molly (Molly McCann). She's looking at the dead birds. Seeing them is upsetting and Gemma tries to give a bit of a lesson about how nature can be cruel at times. It is here that I learned it was the cuckoo bird that does this and the girl is sent on when her mother calls. There's then a kind of funny scene where Tom (Jesse Eisenberg) messes with her. They're dating and in the market for a new house.The couple goes to an office for a development called Yonder. They meet Martin (Jonathan Aris) who wants to take them to a unit to show them around. Gemma doesn't really care for the models and Tom really doesn't want to go. Martin is quite convincing and gets them to check it out.There's something off about Martin, but he is nice. Tom keeps making sarcastic comments and Gemma is doing what she can to make it less awkward. Things take a turn though when Martin disappears. The couple tries to leave, but no matter which turns they make, they end back up at Unit 9. They decide to stay the night and the next morning, Tom uses his ladder to climb up to the roof. What he finds is chilling. There's no end to the development in sight. There's something not right about the sun or the clouds.Tom then makes a drastic decision, but no matter what he does, it doesn't make a difference. That next morning is when they find a box with a baby inside. There's writing on an inner flap stating if they take care of it, they'll be able to go. Much like where they're trapped, there's something not right about this child and Tom continues to try to find a way out.This is where I want to leave it, as I don't really want to spoil the movie. I do think there's a lot to unravel here. Something interesting about this movie is that we don't get a definite answer. I did look up an interview to find that the director, Lorcan Finnegan, as well as the writer Garret Shanley. According to them they did this on purpose. They do like the different concepts and theories that have come up. I have incorporated some from them what I think into my interpretation here as well.I'm also going to try to do this without spoilers. There will be a section at the end as well as a review on my podcast Journey with a Cinephile: A Horror Movie Podcast where I'll delve into this as well. The first thing is that the opening scene of this bird nest is quite important. All I'll say here is that the boy they have to raise is like the cuckoo in that, he drives a wedge between them and takes over their lives. I also feel there's a bit of sucking the energy from his 'parents'. The longer they are there, the more haggard they look.It was interesting to read that this story was inspired by housing developments that popped up in Ireland right before the economic collapse that happened in the late 2000s. This does translate well over to the United States, where I'm from, in the fact that we've been seeing these since I believe the 1970's. Heck, this is part of the concept for the original Poltergeist. These houses are pretty much carbon copy of each other as it cuts down on costs and drives up profit margins.Going from this, there's a bit of creature feature in this movie. We first get introduced to it with Tom while he is digging. He hears a creature faintly and thinks that if he keeps digging, he'll find it. The boy is watching things on television that are in black and white, with an eerily similar noise emanating from it. When he gets older and is portrayed by Eanna Hardwicke. He comes home with a book with similar images from the television. There's a scene with the boy and Gemma where he mimics this sound and it legit chilled me to the bone. It is one of the scariest parts for sure.The last thing I want to talk about when it comes to the story here without spoilers is that we can clearly see they're living in a world that looks like ours, but it isn't right. The houses are all beige. There's no real color. All of the food they eat is similar to what we do, but it is bland and flavorless. The art in the house is just paintings of the room it is in or the outside of the house. The sun isn't right and the clouds look fake. It is just being in a world that is a mimic, but doesn't have the heart that humanity brings. The boy doesn't really know how to convey emotions either. He asks and inquires about them, but we can see he doesn't really understand.To shift this over to the pacing of the movie, I've heard a lot of people saying this should have been 40 minutes like an episode of something like The Twilight Zone. I do get that, where although I did like it, I do feel that it is a bit long. The movie runs 98 minutes, where I legit think that getting this down to 90 and probably even closer to 85 might have tightened it up. I come in with this as the movie doesn't really give us a definite ending and it does get a bit repetitive. I like the open-ended aspect where I can make my own conclusions, but if that's the case, I think it should be trimmed then.What didn't disappoint was the acting. Poots is really the star here. I've been a fan of her for awhile and it is interesting as she doesn't do a lot. I don't think I've seen her in a bad role aside from Black Christmas from 2019. I don't necessarily blame her there though. She has the most depth here and really makes you question what you would do. Eisenberg is interesting as he pushes her humanity and she is saddened by the rift that comes between them. I thought his sarcasm adds to his character for sure. Jennings, Aris and Hardwicke were all solid. There's something off about them all and it really made me feel uncomfortable for sure. I'd say that overall the acting for this movie was good.Taking this to the effects, we don't really get a lot to be honest. I love how they made this set feel like we're in something like The Truman Show. We know there's something off about it, but here we don't really know what it means. Most of the effects seemed to be done practical, which is always a good thing for me. If there is some CGI, it was seamless. They do have some really good cinematography and the use of color late in the movie is great to signify different things. The devoid of color for most of it makes sense as well.The last thing to go over would be the soundtrack. We get a few indie songs that I had never heard of, but I really like their sound. It brings an interesting vibe to the movie and just fit for what they needed. I'd legit consider adding these to my playlists. The rest of it also fit and helped to enhance the scenes they were used.Now with that said, I really liked the concept of the movie and the story they're presenting us. We get some interesting social commentary here that I can appreciate. I thought the acting was good across the board with Poots taking the lead. The effects we get, the use and not using of color was strategic. We get a solid little soundtrack. I'd have to say that this is a good movie and one that I would like to check out again. It really made me uneasy feeling and I'd actually recommend this to horror and non-horror fans alike as well.
SPOILERS:What I wanted to delve into here is what I think this movie is about. We have Martin who needs to bring a couple to a house in order to raise another child like him. They grow quite fast, make a loud screaming sounds that are annoying and really just mimics his 'parents'. As I said above, he is driving a wedge between Gemma and Tom. I also think this is an allegory for young couples having children before they're ready. Tom is kind of a jerk here and rejects the child flat out. Because he sees it as a creature, he is willing to starve it until it dies. I guess you could see this as an abortion of sorts. Gemma isn't prepared, but she feels a kinship to it as time goes on and can't just let it die. I feel this is the other side of Tom.The boy is a monster though. We get an odd scene where Tom throws a cigarette down and the artificial grass disappears. He starts to dig. Because this world isn't quite right, his body bruises and the food he's eating aren't giving him the actual nutrition that he needs. He breaks down and wastes away. The constant digging doesn't help. He does find something in the hole and I think that it is a former occupant of the house. Like the cuckoo does, the boy is taking the life away from these two people until he's ready to go into the world. What I did pick up on from a podcaster in passing is that this is also an allegory for capitalism. The body that Tom finds is his own and through work he's digging his own grave.",Vivarium
28,EdgarST,"Viva ""Vivarium""!",10,28 June 2020,"Why was it that all those who glorified «The Lighthouse» and «Midsommar» in January never spoke of the existence of «Vivarium», which far surpasses them in the originality of its script (by Garret Shanley), the intelligent direction, the performances by a magnificent cast (crowned with the Best Actress award at Sitges for Imogene Poots), the creativity in the production design and a varied, measured and sinuous soundtrack?Someone else's envy or indigestion with so much Los Angeles cinema? I think that there is a bit of both, plus, without a doubt, aversion to the open film that does not answer all your questions and doubts, but gives you free reign so that you can draw your own conclusions. I don't know where it is now shown (probably on the voracious and corrupted Netflix), but wherever it is, watch it.A young couple (an elementary school teacher and a gardener) arrive at a real estate agency in search of a place to live and are greeted by a sinister sales agent who takes them to the Yonder suburb, horribly similar to the meters and meters of houses that we all know, taken here to the extreme, with everything looking like a green maquette, with little clouds that seem to hang from some heavenly fly system. When the agent disappears, the couple is trapped in Yonder, where no matter how many turns they make, they forever go back to house No. 9, to which someone or something punctually delivers a box of groceries. On the third day, an unscheduled box appears on the street, with a baby and a message that reads, ""Raise the child and be released."" What follows cannot and should not be recounted. It is horrendous. And not because it is a horror film full of shocks, no, it is a terrifying science-fiction film because of the similarities it offers with real life: parenthood, education, the media, uniformed minds, the massification of thought...Great film, made with Irish, Belgian, Danish, English and American capital, it is highly recommended, the more so for lovers of genre cinema.",Vivarium

This is a wonderful mix of tropes. There is a prisoner / abductee trope, there is ""adoption of a strange child"" trope, there is a ""troubled couple"" trope, there is even a mystery trope.I'm fully of the opinion that the right thing to do in any abduction situation is to not reward the criminals with what they want because there is no reason that while they have all the power that they're going to do anything to benefit the victims. We get see an exploration of what people do in a dire situation and given a task, similar to a couple different ""Twilight Zone"" episodes.The production value is clearly here, and while they appear to have saved some money on limited locations, it clearly put to good use as the movie delves deeper into its story.I can't recommend this enough, please give it a shot all the way through.",Vivarium

I understood the social narrative and the cuckoo in the nest metaphor but the film was boring, nothing much happens and the dialogue was tedious and hardly mind expandingly existentially deep; apart from the fact it has been done to death in many other better and more in depth movies!Nope folks what we have here is a totalitarian Turkey-burger in the same vein as Mother and other tedious pretentious tales that the equally ever so clever filmmakers will try and dupe you into believing are mind expanding and so intelligent you should like it and feel small and embarrassed if you don't - Sorry NO thanks!",Vivarium

34,rockman182,Vivarium (2019),7,31 July 2020,"I read a lot of people were talking about this film and it took me a century to realize it was on Amazon Prime. Imogen Poots is becoming an indie film queen. She's always fantastic in whatever she does and she's usually a strong indicator of whether I watcha film or not. With Vivarium its a wonderful idea, that feels like something out of the Twilight Zone. However, it would have worked better as a short TV show episode rather than a 90 minute film.
The film is about a young couple who are looking to buy a house together. They meet with a weird and off putting real estate agent who introduces them to a house on Yonder which is a housing development that is the stuff of suburban nightmares. Every house is identical. The couple find that they can't leave their home. No matter what they do, they also seem to be the only ones in the development. They soon realize they must raise a child given to them to leave the house. The film also stars Jesse Eisenberg, and interestingly this is the second time I'm seeing the two leads pairing after The Art of Self Defense which was absolutely amazing.
The set up for the film is amazing. Like I said earlier, its so reminiscent of a very good Twilight Zone episode for the first half and hour or so. The idea, atmosphere, and setting is so good. Once the couple receive the baby the film soon becomes flat and feels like it was drawn out. The film has a really annoying child actor, which is fine because hes the absolute devil. Everything else just becomes repetitive (especially with Jesse Eisenberg's character) and I feel like the script ran on fumes for a while. I was fine with the ending but the uneven nature of the film hurt it from being much better.This seemed perfect for me because I love dystopian films with elements of horror. This was fantastic for a third of its running time and then needed much better writing. I would still recommend watching it. I'm sure others might really like it as a whole and I think the idea itself it set up well so its worth checking out. Lets just hope Ms. Poots gets better work because shes underrated. Hell, she was even the best part of a really awful Black Christmas remake.

Do you ever think about how your life is shaped by what the society and your close ones expect from you? Do you ever think about your legacy?

My initial thoughts are that additional scenes at the beginning to develop the characters more would have helped us empathize with them. Also, some explanation as to the origins of Martin and the boy would have given some closure. It wouldn't have to be complex but more than the images in the book and on the TV would be nice. It needed more definition in that regard. The Idea was interesting, not enough for a feature film. Interesting premise, cool visuals, good first act and setup then nothing, paper thin metaphors shoved down your throat, cardboard cutouts of characters and an utterly underwhelming climax, I felt numb and empty at the end of the film, this is a totally brainless film. NO story. No character. There is isn't even any acting. This is WORSE than The Room. At least that film tried to tell a story.

I've seen this movie, I like the genre of terror and when I heard about it, I said, well, it looks good, well, I'm going to see it. It was a little disappointment. It does not come to an end in any of the senses, well in one, the actors.It is not a scary movie, it is not scary per se, or I at least have not been scared at any time. It touches too many subjects, marriage, feminism, capitalism, equality, but it does not end any, nor does it deepen. And it leaves several loose ends, without response.The actors are fine, if that must be said. They are all great. The presentation of the actors does seem great to me. He presents them in a simple plane.I have found it curious that I have seen the washing machine put on in the movie, but I have not seen the actors change costumes.The effects seem incredibly bad to me. It seems incredible how they can be so bad.The beginning of the film, if it had been simpler, more fluid, it would have been still great, to show how terrible nature is, but it has done it so long and so far, that it is ugly.Lighting is nothing special. It is not bad, but it does not become an illumination that puts you in history.The director does not get to do his job well. The rhythm has some moments where it falls, it is not difficult either, it is a complicated film. But it is not clear where to go.

Both of which is far superior than this one!Imogen Poots & Jesse Einsberg were decent in their protrayal of characters that did not want to be stuck in this predicament... Shame that the movie dragged on and on. I do not know what the film makers were trying to achieve with this film but I doubt it was to leave the viewer(s) with an ending so morbid it's also a visual version of attending a funeral.,Vivarium

52,PyroSikTh,"Dull, Over-Long, and Anti-Climatic",4,18 November 2020,"Vivarium follows a young couple who are looking for their first house together. They're looking for the perfect home they can settle down and have kids in, that will last them decades to come. One estate agent in particular pushes them to look at a property immediately, and the couple find themselves stuck in a never-ending residential area. They're given a baby to look after, and told if they raise it, they will be set free. The child ages rapidly over the course of a year, Tom dedicates his time to digging a hole in the front garden for...reasons, and Gemma reluctantly raises the difficult and alarming child to adulthood. And then they die, and the cycle repeats.If that sounded a little dull and anti-climatic, that's because that's exactly what this film is. Worryingly, I think that may have been the point. The director has gone on the record to say that the movie is a metaphorical criticism of capitalism and suburbia, where we move into a house that looks like everyone else's, work meaningless jobs until we die, and are pressured to have kids to make sure the cycle repeats itself. That's just life. Life is dull, repetitive, and anti-climatic. That's what this movie wants to say, and yet it's not really what it ends up saying at all, at least not to my own interpretation.Instead for me, the movie was a harsh criticism of children. Children are horrible. Don't have them. They will trap you and ruin your life. As a father of two boys, this is of course a point I strongly disagree with. Children are great. They're fascinating, curious, and offer an unrivalled sense of accomplishment. Without my children, my life would be all the more dull, repetitive, and anti-climatic. Of course they're challenging to raise, which this movie has no problems exploring, but they come with a wealth of positives as well. The film has no interest in that. These brood parasites are just horrible to the bone, and the only answer is cruelty and neglect, apparently. We watch this couple abuse this child over the course of a year, which is understandable considering the circumstances, but still a disgustingly cynical viewpoint of humanity's default reaction to troubled children. The fact Gemma is a nursery/primary school teacher just makes her actions even more insulting and inconsistent.As for Tom, he dedicates his time to digging a hole until he dies of, presumably, exhaustion. Metaphorically this is of course to show how we work ourselves to death. We dig our own graves by giving our efforts to the man and not to ourselves. But why is he digging a hole from a narrative standpoint? What's he expecting to find down there? To what end does he keep digging this hole? Who knows. We need a metaphor to explain capitalism forcing us to dig our own graves, so we'll just have him literally digging his own grave without knowing why. Sure.So who is the kid? Who is the estate agent? Why are Gemma and Tom trapped here? The answer's pretty obvious to anyone paying attention. The film literally opens with a montage of a cuckoo kicking eggs and fledglings out of a nest and reaping the benefits from it's unwittingly surrogate parents. This is almost literally what the child does. The estate agent gives the couple a nest, and fills it with his own offspring (not literally, I don't think, but offspring of his species), and expects them to raise it for him, which they have no choice but to do. Gemma remarks at one point about how the boy is a mystery, and she's determined to crack it, but she never does. Maybe this is meant to be another allegory for suburbia quashing our dreams and hobbies, but it results in a movie shockingly unsatisfactory at its most shallow level. They're a race of interdimensional beings that can manipulate space and time, and they live among us in order to abduct young couples to raise their young...and that's it. That's all we get.
All that aside, there is something deeply Lovecraftian about this, in the most modern way. The idea of being trapped, alone, in a vapid existence, with an alien child, is truly terrifying. There's no way out. There's no end. Just rows and rows of duplicate houses and depressingly perfect clouds day in, day out. It's an idea, and an execution, that tests the limits of human sanity. And honestly, that's low key what I hated most about this movie. The manufactured, duplicated houses under a perfect sky is truly nightmarish. I feel uncomfortable enough walking around somewhere with no horizon; just rooves as far as the eye can see, and that was almost all there was to this movie. An endless nightmare of claustrophobic repetition and duplication with no end.This was not a movie I'd recommend, which coming from a big fan of the surreal, the artsy, and the metaphorical, says a lot. I don't need things spoonfed to me, not least because I have demonstrated in this review how well I understood this movie both metaphorically and literally, but I need more than this. I need a satisfactory ending. Closing the movie with ""And then they died..."" is lazy and makes me feel like I just wasted my life watching this it. They arrive, they attempt to escape, and then they give in, do as they're told, and get no closure. It's dull, it's repetitive, it's anti-climatic, and it goes on way too long. This would've been great cut down to a lean forty minutes to an hour, like the episode of a horror anthology series or something, or if it had delved further into this parasitic race of interdimensional beings and actually given us something to chew our teeth into beyond the obvious 'capitalism is bad, life is meaningless' message they're trying to push. Imogen Poots was the only saving grace, carrying the entire movie on her shoulders, but even then it wasn't enough. The film largely achieves everything it sets out to do, but what it sets out to do just isn't very interesting. I give Vivarium a near-scathing 4/10.",Vivarium

He and Imogen Poots are a young couple looking for a house to call home, who end up stuck in a bizarre and troubling riff on the suburban/nuclear family dream. The sparse script and pared-back nature of the whole production works well, and the performances are good even if the overall whole means that it's hard to detect any real warmth between the central couple - so that when they come under heightened pressure, it's gripping but hard to care for them. There are plenty of interesting ideas here, however, and enough going to suggest that there will be interesting work to look out for in the future from the people behind it.",Vivarium

I was expecting it to be sort of a sci-fi horror survival thriller which it's not. It's basically a social commentary and I think it's important to know this before watching the movie so that you can watch it with the right mindset.If you watch the movie without thinking of it's deeper meaning I don't know if you can really enjoy or appreciate it. You might not like it or even understand it. I was in the mood to watch something fun and entertaining and I wasn't expecting it to be a heavy movie with a deep meaning. So just know what you're getting into.As for the meaning of the movie, I'm sure there many ways to interpret this movie. To me, it is asking humans what do they really want from life and are they really getting it. Do we want to buy that little seemingly perfect house in the nice neighborhood? Do we want to have children? Why are we doing it? Do we have that sense of community or are we all isolated from the world, trapped in our own houses? How close are we to nature? Aren't we destroying nature by trying to create our own ""perfect"" world? How perfect is it really? What do we feel? Are we happy or all that chase after getting what we think we want is really making us depressed?

The latter proved to be an entertaining and thoughtful parable in the atmospheric and thematic traditions of ""The Twilight Zone"", yet not without its flaws and misses.""Vivarium"" is almost entirely based on a metaphor/s, a parable of an often-used theme, a story that knows what it wants to say but, despite a nice flow of inventiveness, can't keep it consistently substantial. The vert first minutes, the intro sequence, heavily foreshadows what ideas are to follow without even using any characters yet. Later on, there are points where the commentary is perhaps too obvious and spoon-fed. Rushed-in family-hood, the challenges of parenthood, ownership and more similar ideas are presented and worked into a dystopian, lab-rat-like environment. There's a decent dose of humor injected in it as well, the more grim kind. The movie plays off its cast's content and realistic little performances, a top-notch, eye-pleasing production design and various atmosphere-setting devices, trying to be an intriguing survival drama that's swimming around the surface while continuously hinting on a something deeper. The deeper never truly comes. ""Vivarium"" succeeds at being a drawn-out episode of what could be an anthology horror series, but as a full feature it lacks additional components. For the most part, it is enough with the presented themes, the distressing and messed up character's new routine and the fantastic, mysterious elements surrounding it, but... ""Vivarium"" has got style, but half-way through it slowly ceases to be enough & as a climax we receive... even more style. Basically, as far as atmosphere, special effects and indie arthouse creativity goes, ""Vivarium"" is a great little flick worth seeing, but chances of eventual underwhelment are there.For anyone who loves oddball indies, mysterious concepts, metaphors, borderless creepiness and what people call ""Twilight Zone-esque"", ""Vivarium"" is a journey worth taking.

65,DeBBss,Like a Long Black Mirror Episode,6,2 August 2020,"Vivarium is one of those ambitious movies where it's either a hit or miss. For me, it's slightly a hit. Some things worked well, and others things didn't work so well. A lot people dislike Vivarium, and I can see why, it's not exactly an enthusiastic movie; it tries to break down the audience. And I think they did a fairly well job at making the audience feel the same moods as the characters.The story is really good in the first act; there's a lot of interesting and confusing things that happen. Then the plot the slows down and focuses on the characters, and that's where the plot loses me. It got boring because the pacing was so slow compared to the first act. Vivarium also has one of those endings where it's profound and delivers a message. But the ending was very predictable because of the whole ""loop"" plot that has been done so many times by now. Vivarium does have some replay value because there's a lot of great foreshadowing, for example, the TV looping is a metaphor to the looping plot.The acting was also very surprising. I first thought that the acting was going to be subpar, but it was solid. Jesse Eisenberg delivered an okay performance, but Imogen Poots was the real star of the show. And because of the acting being so good, it actually makes Vivarium watchable, because without the great performances, Vivarium would seem like a cheap YouTube movie.Vivarium had a great concept, but the interest was seriously lacking after the first act. The pacing is fairly slow and it gets boring real quick. But the acting really makes Vivarium stand up.

68,Coffee_in_the_Clink,A gripping and truly original metaphorical horror that evokes the best of David Lynch,8,16 July 2020,"True horror is a product of its time, in that it evokes the fears and anxieties of a particular generation in a particular time and place. ""Vivarium"" is a peculiar horror, laced with the sort of paternal angst metaphors seen in David Lynch's ""Eraserhead"". A young couple named Tom and Gemma (excellent performances from Jesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots) are looking for their forever-home. Tom is a landscaper and Gemma is a school-teacher. They are brought to a brand-new housing estate called Yonder by a strange salesman - strange is actually an understatement. Yonder is typical suburbia. But it looks weird. The houses - hundreds of them - are meticulously placed and clones of one other. They are painted a green colour that lends them a further surreal quality. Gemma and Tom are shown around the house. Again, it is your typical suburban home, but this fella is far from your typical salesman! He freaks them out, so the couple call it a day and go to leave - just after they go out into the garden and come back inside to find the salesman is gone. They get lost trying to drive out of the estate. Every road leads them back to the house they were viewing. Then the car runs out of petrol and they are stranded... worse is yet to come, when a baby is left at their doorstep, with instructions to raise the child, in order to be released.Young Senan Jennings officially portrays the creepiest and most annoying child to ever grace the screen! What a performance. The sense of dread and the feeling of being watched carries throughout the film, very well directed by Irish director Lorcan Finnegan. As mentioned earlier, Eisenberg and Poots are excellent and do well conveying the sense of complete anguish and bewilderment that their characters face. Yonder looks amazing; a surreal nightmare of meticulous driveways and lawns, under a dreamlike sky with strange clouds. I loved that aspect of the film, along with the metaphors; ultimately, the film is about the milestone step in a relationship when a couple commit to a home together, and with the fear of parenthood hanging over them, and whether or not they want to go down that road or not. By the films conclusion, we are left with an empty feeling as the film evokes the usual suppressed notions we have that all of this life and everything that we do is, ultimately, futile.",Vivarium

3. There is great use of lighting to convey a surreal, hopeless and desperate atmosphere.
4. The sound design and sound mixing are utterly brilliant, and they too feed into the eerily off-putting surroundings.Cons:
1. The comedy is extremely stale and it probably requires a very unique sense of humour to appreciate.
2. A rather quickly looked-over, but still large, plot-hole: A) If Tom and Gemma were not interested in that type of property, then why did they waste time agreeing to accompany Martin (Jonathan Aris) to said house?
3. The lip-syncing for Young Boy (Senan Jennings) is a little off at certain points.
4. The wafer-thin plot means that the film is imbued with countless filler moments and needlessly prolonged scenes.
5. The slow pacing is way off and the movie does absolutely nothing to warrant said pace.

Seriously, this is one of those movies that looks like an art school project that somehow got state funding. It's just a smarty premise that would be a good starting point to make something interesting, but alas... it doesn't go anywhere. Not in the least.
It tries to be sci-fi, and it fails because there is no sci whatsoever.
It tries to be social commentary, but it stops on the brink of exposing suburbia for being a sterile cookie-cutter machine that conforms people to a standard (there, I've said more in this sentence than the whole movie ever does).

This is well made and well acted with a couple of genuinely creepy performances by one adult and one child. The actual stars, Imogen Poots and Jesse Eisenberg also produced, so this is something they wanted to do and it's kind of surprising on Eisenberg's part as it not all that challenging of a role.

They could have done so much more, if they did, the movie could have been so much better. No need to change the ending, I think that even if it's very predictable, it makes sense and is good, but the middle, the two characters being in the situation is what fell flat.

89,MinistryofDoom,A Tim Burton-esque Twilight Zone inspired niche art film,5,27 June 2020,"Vivarium was an interesting film. Interesting in it's presentation. Interesting in its visual style. Unfortunately there's not much else there. All the disturbing Tim Burton-esque visual and fantasy influences can't keep this project afloat. The story lacks in coherence and, honestly, it was dreadfully boring. At approximately 2 hours in length and packed with long drawn out scenes of basically nothing, it felt like an extended, albeit, uneventful episode of The Twilight Zone. The story made no sense whatsoever. It was full of plot holes that made me shake my head in disgust. As for the genre, is it Sci-Fi? Horror? Thriller? Drama? It's both all of those things and none of them. The film lacks a sense of urgency that is found in most typical sci-fi, thrillers and horror movies. OK, they're in this community and they don't want to be there, but they're not being threatened, they're not in danger, they're not even in fear of risking their lives. They're just in a community...full of green houses...with no explanation as to why they are there, and so the film relies heavily on the psychological state of the characters to keep the audience engaged. What sense of urgency the film lacks is compensated for what the viewers themselves, in a state of confusion about what is actually happening, project up on the film. In the end, this can be cataloged in the art film genre, mostly due to it's presentation. It will probably have a cult following in the coming years and find it's niche within circles of artsy film aficionados and that's just fine...if that's your thing.",Vivarium

Proceed with caution, however, because almost anyone can find him or herself bogged down or oppressed in this sluggish, unpleasant and oddly undercooked nightmare that takes place in a suburban hell. Imogen Poots and Jesse Eisenberg are a young couple looking for their first house when they come across a seemingly idyllic community. They soon discover their fortunes have changed drastically.What starts out as an intriguing mystery with funny clouds eventually devolves into a monotonous and achingly vacant story of imprisonment in an endless maze. Although the idea itself is not at fault, its execution most certainly is. For a film that chooses to be such an ordeal, there is quite a lot that is never fleshed out. There is a fair chance you will make it to the end wondering what the whole point of it actually was. Is it a tutorial on the challenges of young parenthood? A case study on Stockholm syndrome? A horror story on the housing market? It's anyone's guess as to what this film is even about. But searching for any concrete meaning here might be just as foolish as the protagonists' decisions. Not recommended at all.",Vivarium
96,TheRadiobox,Suburban insecurities,6,10 August 2020,"Vivarium was directed by Lorcan Finnegan, written by Garret Shanley, and stars Imogen Poots, Jesse Eisenberg, Senan Jennings, Jonathan Aris, and Eanna Hardwicke. It follows a couple as they look for a perfect home, only to find themselves trapped in a seemingly unending series of identical houses.Plotting is mainly a metaphor, but has some serious high points. Tom (Eisenberg) and Gemma (Poots) are looking to buy a house. The couple meets Martin (Aris), a realtor who seems a bit off. He takes them to Yonder, a quiet series of identical homes that are reportedly very popular. As they tour house #9, Martin leaves and the couple decides to leave Yonder; although they find out that they cannot, all roads lead to house #9 and their car runs out of gas. They burn down #9, and they get a baby in the mail with a message telling them to raise it in order to leave. After a few months, the baby (Jennings) has grown exponentially. As the boy grows, Tom and Gemma become distant. After the boy disappears and later reappears with a book containing a revelation. The couple reunite and make a last ditch effort to escape Yonder.Characters are thin, but have some good aspects. Tom is some kind of construction worker with knowledge of nature, which does surprisingly come into play in the story; his presumable previous job giving him a purpose in the new, otherworldly neighborhood. Gemma is a teacher, with probable aspirations to settle down with Tom. If the couple were given a bit more time to develop, and the time spent in Yonder was shortened by 5 to 7 minutes, the movie would be a lot better for it. Martin is an effectively unnerving segue into the bizarro suburban environment, and the Boy is good in his own surreal, sociopathic way. Performances help to save the movie from itself, Eisenberg and Poots show good chemistry in the first few minutes, which visibly deteriorates as they spend more time in Yonder. The usually energetic Eisenberg becomes dead-eyed, and Poots goes from happy and delightful to anxious and alone. It's very good work from both of them.Vivarium's message is sent with deadpan, often black delivery, and satirical horror. The whole ""suburban life will suck you dry"" bent is familiar, having been done in movies like the 'Burbs and the Jonses. Still, the movie does provide some solid moments of both comedy and horror. A fantastic scene involving the couple, the Boy, and their car is scary, yet has humor running through it. And another when Gemma and the Boy play pretend; the scare is foreshadowed, but what happens is so bizarre that it retains its effect. While the message is clear and has its high points, it does overstay its welcome; having to watch Tom and Gemma as they go through a routine for so long gets monotonous. Surely the point, but said point has already been made. It also seems condescending coming from Hollywood, the home of many stars, multimillionaires, and corporations trying to tell a large portion of its audiences that their living conditions suck.Technically the movie is very good. It is a good tutorial on how to make a movie that has very few locations feel like it has even less, and to great effect. Set design is pristine, glossy, and lifeless, keeping with the theme. Lighting is a strong point of the movie, the setting sun and dark nights look beautiful with the golden yellows and oranges and deep blues and black contrasting with the drab greens and greys of Yonder. There are major pacing issues though. The second act feels too long, going through the same motions the movie went through one day on repeat, if there was a bit more variance this could have been resolved, as well as offering a brief reprieve from the single joke/scare the movie has going for it.While the message is clear and has several high points, Vivarium suffers from its single purpose. A fantastic start, some genuinely effective moments, and solid performances keep the movie interesting for a while; but it can feel mean spirited and condescending. Nonetheless, a majority of the movie is involving, creepy, and funny.63/100",Vivarium

Is Jesse Eisenberg broke or being blackmailed to do this movie? Are all the subliminal messages like giving the finger in the movie a warning to the viewer to stop watching? These are very interesting questions that we do not have answers to.
At first I thought that the couple had been abducted and taken off to some holographic world to be studied or maybe they were... demons? These questions are never answered and I am left with maybe the movie was a metaphor?! I thought that this was supposed to be a comedy and I wanted to laugh... What I got hurt my soul.
The impression that I got after watching this movie is that the writer has serious mommy issues that as a viewer I wished he hadn't shared with me. When Jesse Eisenberg's character dies his girlfriend tries to kill the-whatever the heck it is- he lifts the pavement (YES I kid you not he lifts the pavement like it was a blanket) and crawls away like a cockroach! She follows him and we get a psychedelic vision of other couples in identical situations.

A confounding mystery where average people are thrust into a hopeless nightmare scenario they cannot escape.My problem with this genre, ""the bad guy just wins"" horror genre, is that it's always telegraphed a mile away, and done in a way where it's obvious the protagonists had no hope of winning, ever.Not a lot of drama or tension is possible in a film when you ""know"" the bad guys will win.

100,eelen-seth,Social distancing in The Twilight Zone - intoscreens.com,5,15 April 2020,"Social distancing in The Twilight Zone. There isn't a better time to release Vivarium, a film about a young couple dying to find the perfect home. Soon after Gemma and Tom (played by Imogen Poots and Jesse Eisenberg) visit house nr. 9 in what seems to be copy-pasted straight out of Tim Burton's mind - painting-like identical clouds on the sky included - they find out they're stuck in Yonder - ""Your home. Forever."". What follows is some sort of commentary on the hetero normative ways of living that comes back to bite us in the ass.Lorcan Finnegan's film (which he co-wrote with screenwriter Garret Shanley) doesn't give our couple much to do, beside roaming the empty streets of suburban purgatory in a depressive state of mind, until a baby in a cardboard box gets dropped in front of their new home. With it, there's a note stating they'll have to raise the child in order to be released. The child grows rapidly and is definitely a caricature on how annoying children really can be. Screaming and mimicking their voices like some sort of small alien demon, it mostly gets on Tom's nerves, who escapes the dreadful long days by digging for clues in his own front yard, looking for another way out.It's mostly Poots who does the heavy lifting here in which she interacts with the child when it's not looking at some mysterious Videodrome-esque tv-screen, who's mysteries never get revealed. While Eisenberg slowly gets turned into a one-dimensional being, the film drags further to a somewhat surprising twist that doesn't explain a thing, but leaves you thinking about the way we are all just numbers and in the end just get replaced, whether that may be in the workplace or in our personal lives.Lorregan has a vision and executes it well, although his suburban nightmare never gives a direct answer to all the questions you might end up asking. This social experiment from hell takes a bit too long to puzzle its way through what in the end seems like a waste of time, and is perhaps just a bit too real to be considered a bad joke, or as we call it, life.",Vivarium

102,nashw82,Definitely not for everyone,8,27 March 2021,"This strange, surreal slow burn of a film will definitely not appeal to everyone's tastes, but for those who enjoy something new, creative and just plain weird, this could be a favourite.Imogen Poots and Jesse Eisenberg lead the film which only has 4 characters in total, and they do a fantastic job of their roles with such a completely off the wall script.The simple premise is that they are looking for a house and when a creepy agent takes them to a maze like neighbourhood where every house is identical and there seems to be no way out, they are forced to live there in a world that is an especially bland kind of hell.This notion of being trapped in a home for seemingly endless time, where the days just blur together, is so perfectly fitting for this year. The fact that this movie was released the month the pandemic began in the US makes it such a surreal prophetic coincidence that is almost impossible to believe. In fact this should probably come with a trigger warning for anyone who chooses to watch it during lockdown, though perhaps you will be thankful that your situation isn't as bad as theirs.While the premise might seem so simple that you wonder how they fill the run time, please know that they keep things moving with the introduction of further plot developments which I won't spoil here. While it may drag for some I feel this is the intention, to put the viewer in the same frame of mind as the characters living through this hellish nightmare. And there is an underlying subplot that goes some way to explain the situation they found themselves in, which, while not unexpected, is definitely interesting.If you enjoy strange films, surreal places with, where reality is slight twisted in a surreal or paranormal way, then this is definitely worth a watch, and it will stay with you for some time.",Vivarium

Her gorgeous 'girl next door' look works perfectly in every frame. Jesse Eisenberg puts in the hard yards as a slightly toned down version of himself.The story starts with Jemma and Jesse accepting an offer to visit some display homes. They follow the salesman to an estate that's so new, the roads don't even have signs yet. The houses are nice enough, but every one is identical. Curiously, they're all painted in the same shades of green. The whole situation is a very weird, but they roll with it until... well, you'll need to watch the movie to find out.Vivarium is arguably the best interpretation of Franz Kafka's work to date, and draws upon two of his most well known quotes:'Better to have, and not need, than to need, and not have.''I am constantly trying to communicate something incommunicable, to explain something inexplicable, to tell about something I only feel in my bones and which can only be experienced in those bones. Basically it is nothing other than this fear we have so often talked about, but fear spread to everything, fear of the greatest as of the smallest, fear, paralysing fear of pronouncing a word, although this fear may not only be fear but also a longing for something greater than all that is fearful.'Kafka himself was a poor interpreter of his own work, which he rarely studied and often misunderstood. This is why films like Vivarium are so necessary.Jemma and Jesse are defined not by their characters, but by their relationship and its uneasy dynamic. The arrival of a newcomer is destabilising because they cannot adapt to a situation over which they have no control. Jemma's realisation of this fact is neatly articulated in Act 2, when she says 'Believing in progress does not mean believing that any progress has yet been made.'It is only much later in the film that they finally realise they are free, and this is why they are lost. As Jesse says in Act 3, 'I am in chains. Don't touch my chains.' It's a powerful and highly relatable metaphor.Vivarium was brought to the big screen by Lovely Productions (in association with Fantastic Films, Frakas Productions, PingPongFilm and XYZ Films) on a tiny budget of $4 million, most of which came from a grant donated by Deutsche Telefunken. Its high production values confirm that the money was well spent.I rate Vivarium at 29.97 on the Haglee Scale, which works out as a Kafkaesque 8/10 on IMDB.",Vivarium

The film hooks you quite quickly and builds up through an interesting premise and just gets better and better. It's interesting and it makes you think which I appreciate cause I hate being spoon fed answers. That being said sometimes it feels like it's ambiguous for the sake of it rather than being ambiguous with reason.
The film has a lot of surprises and it isn't that predictable. The morbid aspect is really handled well and is quite sinister and I loved that. It makes for a really great ending even if it's not the ending you might of hopedOverall it's a terrifc horror film which is grim but raises some good questions, if you look below the surface.

The sanitized beautiful environment is normally a dream for people but feels like a surreal bizarre nightmare because of the soullessness.I feel the rough patch of this movie is definitely the second act.

It's a well packaged whole with a great 3rd act , is well acted despite a shaky dialog.This might explain the lower scores obtained by vivarium compared to the platform, yet both movies are conceptually the same: dystopian, uncomfortable scifi on lower budget acting as allegories to modern society.There was nothing wrong with vivarium. The fact that some commenters have compared it to a black mirror episode is a testament to black mirror's production values , and shouldn't be used against vivarium.I enjoyed it.

125,Maelific71,Trapped And Unhappy,3,14 July 2020,"Yet another movie full of metaphors. And the point? Well it's obvious right? But seriously ask yourself if this overused ""tactic"" turns this work of so-called ""art"" into a good movie. So let me ask again - what was the point? Enter those who falsely claim anyone who does not like it is too unintelligent to ""understand."" Unfortunately, their psychological need to feel superior fails miserably because we all DO get it - but so what? The only thing this endeavor demonstrates is that using metaphors doesn't automatically morph a bad movie (about the experiences in life most people have, will have, or already had) into anything worth watching. I certainly didn't have to be bored and annoyed it's entire length so it could ""teach"" us something we already know and completely understand.",Vivarium
126,tvdefrancesco,Wrap This Movie In a Body Bag and Throw it Down a Hole,4,12 August 2020,"I think this movie could have been really good. Unfortunately it was not. There should have been more scenes at the beginning of the boy's life. The movie seemed to jump about 8 years at a time and really missed some opportunities.
There were interesting ideas and scenes sprinkled along the way but they were never explored. What were the images on the tv? What was the book of code? What kind of species or creature was the boy? What the hell happened at the end? Why couldn't they find a way out? Where were they? How was this neighborhood created and why?
The final nail in the coffin was when Tom finally found something in the hole (a body) after 18 years or so and didn't even mention it to Gemma?!?! The director really should have cut 40 minutes of the mundane scenes and explored the world below the curb Gemma passed through, and the unanswered questions I referred to earlier. I was left with more questions at the end, but it wasn't a ""deep"" movie that leaves an open ended question like Inception. I understand the symbolism but it came off as bland, lazy, and somewhat pretentious.
I'm rating this 4 stars because it was a unique idea and I was hooked at first. I also found Tom's relationship with the boy Hilarious. Jesse did well conveying pure disdain for that kid. Imogen really showed off her acting chops with this movie. Her ability to act out a wide range of emotion is impressive. I thought both actors did a great job, but the script and execution was too lackluster to redeem. It's another Sci-Fi movie that will be soon forgotten.",Vivarium

But Imogen Poots redeemed it for me. Her facial expressions and reactions were perfect and not overdone. I think that I first saw her in ""28 Weeks Later."" She was charming in that film, and she has since improved tremendously as an actor. I believe that she is qualified to play the lead consistently in blockbusters now.
As for the film's story itself, as I alluded to earlier, I knew what issues that it was attempting to explore, but it did not draw out the complexities of those issues in an engaging manner.
Overall, I enjoyed it, though.",Vivarium

The guy has zero charisma and appeal and can't carry a movie ) which is this case means that the entire movie is left to our female lead who is talented and is attractive but this movie really needed a team, a pair to carry the movie. We are after all stuck with these two the majority of the movie. I'm not sure what happened or if the director did it on purpose, but the feeling these two leads leave you with is really terrible. You're kinda hoping that the movie will get good so you don't have to focus on them every scene.
Unfortunately the movie never does get good and the leads get more and more unlikable as the movie lurches forward at a snails pace and nothing of any importance happens at all. Zero. Nothing. They get stuck. They stay stuck.
There is zero point to this movie.

The directing was well done but the script was so dull and boring that it leaves you wondering why on earth would this get made. It is like a Truman show except imagine getting stuck in the house the entire time and literally nothing happens. Jessie character was a total waste of time until he dies.

And the perennial nerd Eisenberg against type as janitor / mainly man? That might be the least believable aspect of this wacky film. No but seriously, this oddly timely film is a strong recommendation for me. EI would say my main criticism of this is that it tries to play it a bit too smart (cute) for its own good. There's a thin line between legitimately, intensely smart and a kind of ""Webster's defines..."" faux intelligence. The title (umm, do you know Latin??) broaches this territory as do some of the fiercely transparent metaphors.This film enters the metaphysical very quickly. Perhaps too early? I felt that way in the moment, but seeing how things play out, I feel it really works. And I don't care that the demon/quasi-satanic stuff is half-baked at best; that's weirdly kind of a positive for me, actually. Much of this movie is played out at face value. And since that face is the very definition of surreal, anything COULD happen next. The film, however, loses its sense of mystery in this regard, and that's undeniable.Vivarium isn't deep or hard to figure out. It's more horror than sci-fi, though it would devotees of the latter would likely balk at that. What it does and does very well is encapsulate a mood inside of a succinct and lovely visual style (""sickening little clouds"" as they're described by Poots). It's legit creepy and the small cast does big things inside of this unreal world. And it closes with an expertly placed XTC song. It's a good one.",Vivarium

138,shannen-l-c,"Interesting concept, poorly executed",3,29 August 2020,"Vivarium is a cool sci-fi concept with a lot of mystery. It did hold my attention and I felt sympathetic to the nighmarish hell that the main characters were trapped in. Unfortunately, the plot doesn't really go ANYWHERE, the ending is underwhelming and everything is left unexplained. There's no real logic to what happens or answers given to the WHY or HOW, it just is what it is. It's not necessary for me to be handed all of the answers on a plate to enjoy a movie, but I need SOMETHING.Imogen Poots holds this movie down with her acting, so kudos to her. I'm still confused by the casting of Jesse Eisenberg. The character he played and the overall tone of the movie didn't fit with his acting style at all. Perhaps my brain simply can't disconnect between him as the comedic, goofy nerd guy that I've seen him play so many times. Weirdly, this movie is labelled as a comedy, but it's NOT. I'm as confused about that categorisation as I am by Jesse Eisenberg being casted...The best part of the movie is definitley the concept. It would've worked perfectly as an Inside No. 9 episode (conviniently, the mysterious house in the movie is number 9). It doesn't have enough story to sustain it for a 1 hour 30 minute movie, it would've been much more effective if it'd been condensed down into a 30 minute TV episode. The twists would've been much more effective, the lack of plot would've been easier to forgive and overall, it would've been much more entertaining.",Vivarium

140,helenbassett,Vivarium Film Review - Lorcan Finnegan Directs Imogen Poots & Jesse Eisenbeg Buried Alive In The Scary Reality Of A Magritte Surrealist Suburbia,10,31 March 2020,"We watched while our government threw money at builders to get them to build identikit homes on identikit estates for those desperate to get on the housing ladder. In Vivarium, Lorcan Finnegan shows us the sci-fi horror of the dystopian reality for a young couple who believed the hype of boring box like suburbia.Imogen Poots and Jesse Eisenberg want a home of their own and somehow wander into an estate agents staffed by Martin. Jonathan Aris is like the big bad wolf tempting Gemma and Tom to come and visit Yonder. It's a Goldilocks sort of place, just near enough, and yet far enough, and just the right distance. From nowhere? Run away as fast as you can. It clearly isn't what they want looking around the Monopoly green identikit houses in the shop, but they follow Martin out to the estate where No 9 is available. And inside it's everything you expect a show house to be, with the artfully placed lamps, bed throw and welcome pack with champagne and strawberries in the fridge. And a spare bedroom already painted blue. They do want children one day Gemma explains, as they explore the plastic grassed garden. And then they're alone. So they leave too.Except every turn leads back to No 9 in this Escher style estate. And as luck (?) would have it, they run out of petrol right outside No 9, as they drive past once again later that same evening. So they go inside. The strawberries have no taste so I guess they must be Spanish out of season.When Tom climbs on the roof next day he sees nothing but more roofs, so they decide to follow the sun and find their way out. The comedy is black watching them cross garden after garden, always climbing on the same white plastic chair they've dragged across the same manicured green grass, until they finally find a house with lights on. No 9. This is clearly a Truman Show never ending set with Magritte surrealist clouds in the sky.Fortunately a box is always left outside with the same tasteless provisions, for our, let's call them self-isolators of today. Or live lab rats given the actual meaning of vivarium. But tomorrows box is a bit of a kicker. With a baby inside. 'Raise the child and be released' is the included instruction. Maybe all new babies should come with this get out clause. But this alien, the cuckoo in the nest we are forced to accept, is a fast grower and as day 96 passes he is already 7. Played by Senan Jennings he screams at Gemma and Tom until he is fed, like the poor birds dealing with the actual cuckoo in the nest, and watches the only tv channel with its black and white puzzles, even though they tell him to turn it off. And in reality this is actually how some poor parents live.After taking refuge in their car Gemma and Tom are amazed to find the radio still works and dance with joy until their 'son' joins in. Copying their movements he is quite fascinating as all children copy their parents to learn. But with a creepy robotic style voice that immediately makes you wary. They could be any young family dancing crazily in the empty street. In a few months the UK will look like this again.But Tom is the first to snap after these long months. He deals with the monotony by digging a hole in the plastic garden. Their relationship reduced to a few words here and there. With Tom continuously hearing noises further below, maybe a way out if he can only dig deep enough. It becomes a full time job of futility as he grows weaker. While Gemma struggles with maternal issues for the parasitic thing tied to them, and sits by the washing machine that washes the clothes they don't have.It's an absolutely fascinating film, in months the child grows into a cookie cutter callous young man, now played by Eanna Hardwicke, who Gemma follows when he goes out for his Escher style daily walk. She's literally walking around the bend. As our loving young couple fall further into their suburban nightmare.The ending is brutal, a shocking Alice In Wonderland fall to other unseen Gemma and Toms in equally trapped desperate circumstances. What an idea and script by Lorcan Finnegan and Garret Shanley. But I think in this cookie cutter film I would have liked to know who is behind this, and why? And then it all starts again.Now streaming online, or is that screaming online? I watched it on BFI Player.",Vivarium

Yes, there was a little suspense, but that got ruined after the girl decided to save the child. And the worst part is that the film explains not a single crap of the story at the ending.

It feels like the actors were told to just make up a dialogue on the spot.For a movie of this kind to sustain our attention for a full hour and a half there needs to be more than just the initial concept. Unfortunatley there's not. There's no twist. There's no second act. There's a really interesting ""nightmare""-type scene towards the end which feels for a moment like the movie's finally going somewhere. But then it dissipates and we're left with nothing much once more.Why didn't the protagonists try and decipher the book that was delivered? Surely that was a vital clue? What caused their health to fail? Why didn't they try breaking into other houses on the street?

I liked all the background on the images. It could be shorter but I wouldn't want to cut much of anything out. It's a dreamy sequence of events. And that is not a spoiler. I like the characters. The antagonist is interesting. At the time I wrote this review there are two goofs and neither one of them is a goof. I like the simplicity of the set. I'm curious what they did to create it without wasting material. I like the behavior between the lead characters. When you create an unreal world you need a way to manage the characters. I don't know if this came from a book but the aging sequences were a bit underwhelming. I give us an eight because it is very entertaining and playful with the mind.

That of Imogen Poots was remarkable: as she displayed a great deal of emotional range and nuanced acting - essentially holding the entire film together. The part of the young boy (Senan Jennings) was well-written - his performance well-directed.The story was also well-written with a sci-fi\horror mystery-driven theme that has you guessing throughout the film but never taking over the plight of the young married couple. This made for great drama held together by Poots.Even when the film is over, you have both the final answers and (for the really curious) additional trivial questions.Don't over-analyze, accept the (quirky) circumstances for what they are and enjoy the ride.

However, there's a certain serendipity to the timing, with Finnegan crafting a story that is wonderfully bleak, totally unnerving, and incredibly prescient for the times.For those who are curious, the word ""vivarium"" refers to a place such as a laboratory where animals or plants are kept under conditions simulating their natural environment so that they can be observed, typically for research.While Jesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots represent the proverbial labs rats in this mystery-horror-thriller, it's the impotency of adulthood and cracks in modern society that fall squarely under Finnegan's keen eye and sharp filmmaking.

""Just you wait, Cletus, I can tell just LOOKIN' at that guy that he's ONE OF THEM.""

It starts with a cuckoo. Do you really need any more explanation? The writer had an idea, what if there's a species that uses us like a cuckoo? Then he wrote this. It has no other meaning. It is what it is. It was an interesting idea but a terrible writing and execution.The actors were terrible. The writing was super lazy.. The characters were the dumbest people ever. Along with the movie's director.I only gave it 5 as it was very interesting. I thought it'll have a proper ending, but it turned out that the whole story was just FLat.

167,igl-55560,Flat Earth and Reptilians made into a movie !!!,4,16 November 2020,"Well, there are many ways to portray the monotony of life aside from the metaphor of the vivarium run by reptilian beings.
I felt like watching a summary of all the flat Earth arguments : following the sun, yet going in circles (not circumnavigating), the girl mocking his boyfriend for digging all his way down up to Australia or Hell (Sheol), windless atmosphere (no motion whatsoever), clouds painted on a dome-like sky and so on...
And right from the start, we are shown brood parasitism with the cuckoo bird which lays his egg in another species' nest to force them to feed its cuckoo chick.
What does this has to do with a so-called portrayal of the monotony of suburban life when it is shown that it is a race of reptilian that does the same brood parasitism to humans ?This is a movie that will give more arguments to David Icke's followers and they are not going to pretend that it is a metaphor.",Vivarium

It's black mirror episode that was trashed and someone found the crumpled up sticky note of it and decided to make a movie with it.You can poke holes all you want into the ""theme"" or ""art"" of it; the ""hidden"" messages or ""intellectual"" understanding. I seriously think it was made to just be made.I love weird and bizarre movies. Even ones that are so far out there that many just can't tolerate. This, however, is nothing but time lapsed scenery with actors messing around.It was leading up to an interesting concept, to only leave you off with ""THATS IT!?"" It's like a pilot episode to a show that gets you hooked. But there's no following episode to continue the mystery because it's a movie.If you want to see Jesse being Jesse, watch. If you want to marvel at how beautiful and talented Imogen is, watch. All I got out of this movie, if I can come up with anything at all, is, wow, Imogen is a pretty woman and can convincingly act out any emotion well.Don't let people tell you this only for smart people to understand.

Yes, with different actors and other slight differences but the same formula you've seen a 100 times before. Me, I just love it when a movie turns out to be one I've never seen before.
This one is certainly the latter!A very original sci-fi horror slow burn movie that starts out quite amusing even, but slowly turns more and more creepy ending up downright dark! As someone who appreciates Twilight Zoney stuff, I must say I really liked it.Of course this cant be realized, but I honestly think it would improve if there were different sections for children to review and for grown ups. Really dont mean this in any condesending way but internet throws everything together and I see in almost littarally EVERY movie FULL of countless really ridiculous 1 or 2-star reviews that make no sense.Makes it hard for different groups of people to judge whether they would want to give a movie a try or not, based on the crazy amount of contradicting reviews...But ah well....",Vivarium
170,Amadio,Not for everyone,7,2 April 2020,"While many people complain that 'nothing happens' in this dark tale, it is the set, mood and character studies that are on show. It's true, a few scenes could have been trimmed, and some important reveals are passed over too quickly, but overall the pacing and length of the film are acceptable.
While Eisenb is competent enough (I imagine he can choose to be in any film he wants) his performance is muted and he doesn't really shine. Maybe this is a director thing. Poots, on the other hand, is amazing, well worth watching the film just to see her performance as she goes down into the depths of her soul. She has a wider role to play than Eisenb and she is the star of the show.
Reminiscent of Dogville or Cube with their minimalist sets, the setting for Vivarium also provides a chilling canvas against which the characters are seen to strugggle. There is little distraction from the inner turmoil.
Categorizing this pan-European production (you know the film is going to be different when you see the opening credits and who was involved in making it) is not easy. The genre 'comedy' as appears in IMDB is whimsical to say the least. Sci-fi/drama, though horror - not in a traditional sense- could also be used.

173,dmanyc,Pretty on the Outside; Empty on the Inside,1,3 August 2020,"There's a fine line between an artsy film and a film that looks pretty but has no story to keep you interested. Vivarium is the latter.1) That name. Unless you studied Latin, the title makes no frigging sense. You couldn't have used Yonder as a title since it was the name of the neighborhood from hell?2) Tom and Gemma are a couple looking at starter homes when they come upon Martin, this spawn of Sheldon Cooper and Data, who pushes them to browse one of the numerous identical houses when all of a sudden Tom and Gemma are abandoned by Martin and stuck in this 9th circle of bland, no other humans around to help explain this cold prison without bars.3) Soon after trying to escape but stuck running/driving in circles, huge boxes arrive with equally bland food, clothes, even a baby they have to raise in order to ""be set free"". The baby grows to be an Annoying Kid who repeats Tom's and Gemma's mannerisms, screams incessantly, barks loudly like a dog, etc. I'm not one for corporal punishment, but I kept wishing the adults would've smacked that Annoying Kid upside the head. At least he got locked in the car once.4) Gemma tries to unravel the mystery of the really Annoying Kid, who watches black-and-white patterns on TV, disappears and reappears with more boxes of food and necessities. Tom tries to dig a hole to the other end of the earth, but as he gets deeper, he finds a dead body.5) Soon Annoying Kid becomes Annoying Adult and still no resolution, no explanation, no nothing except he still wanders around the empty neighborhood, Tom drops dead after digging the hole to nowhere, and gets buried in the deep hole. Understandably upset, Gemma fights back but Annoying Adult runs away making alienish noises and crawling like a spider, Gemma goes under an opening in the sidewalk and sees previous ""residents"" before she's back in the bland house from hell and she drops dead as well. Annoying Adult buries both in the deep hole without a care in the world, leaving to return to find Martin dead and aged. Annoying Adult steals the nametag, buries the older Martin in a file cabinet(?), and waits for the next ""customers"".What was the point of this film? There's NO story. No explanation of WTF Martin and the Annoying Doppelganger were (clearly they weren't human judging from their mannerisms, but the closest we got to a reveal, ANY reveal, was Annoying Kid's bulging neck as he was screaming his head off for the bazillionth time). No explanation of why Tom and Gemma were imprisoned against their will. No explanation of how quickly the baby grew to be Annoying Kid then to Annoying Adult, yet Tom and Gemma never aged a day. And how did a smoker like Tom managed to keep what seems like a lifetine supply?This looked like a half-baked Black Mirror/Twilight Zone episode, only Rod Serling, Charlie Brooker, hell even Jordan Peele would've come up with SOME semblance of a story.

It's small, it's simple, it's well-acted, and intriguing. These are the best kinds of movies, so why isn't this more popular?I've heard complaints about Jesse Eisenberg being miscast but I thought he was perfect for the role. Eisenberg is great at playing panicky, hot-headed, jittery characters, and that's exactly what this movie called for. I'd imagine most people if placed in a situation like this, would react exactly how Eisenberg plays his character.I don't have much more to say other than that I was engaged the entire time. The few characters and simple plot elements drove the story into a sort of Twilight Zone mystery - a type of story that doesn't get as much attention in film these days. Now that I think about it, Vivarium reminds me of one of my favourite movies, Coherence (2013). If you like small-scale sci-fi thrillers then I'd highly recommend each of these movies.",Vivarium
177,artsycutie,Did I just watch a movie or take LSD...??,6,8 April 2020,"I'm not sure if I just watched a movie or if I just took some trippy drugs. The movie is quite slow and very strange and I pretty much had no idea what was going on throughout the entire film. At first I was going to give this movie a 1 star rating. But I think the theories on youtube about how this movie is all one video game simulation is very interesting and there are definitely multiple parts of the movie that actually back that theory up. But I do think it is more logical to think that this is an alien abduction done to test human behavior in another world. But I thought it was so interesting to think of this movie as a game, with the food tasting like nothing, buildings rebuilding right away, things just appearing and disappearing, having no subsoils under the ground, and glitches is very telling. I think the most interesting part of the game theory is that the boy actually saw the viewer, or us and began to glitch. It's just a theory but that is so interesting. I feel like you might not necessarily understand the metaphors when you watch the movie but when you read an explanation, it will make a lot of sense. The problem is that the delivery of the movie isn't so great. Viewers may think they are just watching a weird movie with no meaning which is what i thought at first.",Vivarium

So a movie like ""A Quiet Place"" is so good because of the intelligent, creative, resourceful reactions of the characters. Unfortunately here, the characters are boring, dull, and dumb. Their reactions consist mainly of ranting and digging a hole in a random spot. No curiosity about, or attempts to understand the alien child in their midst; or speculation about their obviously technologically advanced captors.I get it, it's mostly a horror movie, not a science fiction. But this is a common science fiction theme: mysterious aliens holding humans captive for what? Experimentation? Simulated home in a zoo? A food source?

192,vandeman-scott,"Existential angst, a study in puke green",7,28 December 2020,"""Vivarium"" is a well-done extended metaphor for suburban living that will ring true for anyone who has ever had the passing thought that their life isn't quite what it was meant to be. That's most of us, from time to time, and that's why this movie will give intuitive viewers the heebie-jeebies.This film is a study in existential angst. Ever have that creeping feeling that nothing in your life has any real meaning? That your very being is merely the set-up to a cosmic, sarcastic punchline? That you're a hamster going nowhere on a wheel inside a ""Life Aquarium""? Yeah, us, too.Young couple Tom and Gemma yearn for that life, only to get ensnared in a grinding, oppressive sameness from which they can never escape. Every day is a carbon copy of the one before. Every sickly green house in their suburban hellscape is identical. Every bland meal is a bore. And worst of all, every interminable moment is as desperate as the last.Upon the arrival of a squalling, demanding, ever-present brat of a child, events take an even stranger turn. The boy is malevolent in his need and, like many parents, Gemma comes to believe he is an alien. ""I am not your mother,"" she says, while simultaneously nurturing ""it."" And to Tom: ""I should have let you kill it while it was young."" It's a chilling commentary on parenting because it's so relatable. Not that we hate our kids, but those thoughts ...In truth, however, Tom and Gemma are the real aliens, or at least they're alienated. They grasp for each other but find themselves pulled further and further apart as they search doggedly for freedom. So here they remain, lonely together.For Gemma and Tom, and maybe for everyone, the cookie-cutter, suburban existence is a trap -- one they entered willingly but from which they can never escape. That's the gut punch of this film.This may not be the healthiest movie to watch under the present circumstances (review written on 12/28/20). As the walls close in on us all and a vague sense of depression pervades every waking hour, ""Vivarium"" packs an even greater emotional wallop than it might ordinarily, so consider this a public health warning.Atmospherically, ""Vivarium"" sports an ambience reminiscent of ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" meets ""American Beauty."" Overall, it's an intelligent, if straightforward, movie with a message that's thought provoking and easy to grasp.Recommendation: Watch.",Vivarium

But it's really a well made film, with good acting, effective and beautiful sets and with some cool special effects, keeping your attention all the way until the end. It's a metaphor about the meaningless of bourgeois life, where the man works himself to death, the wife taking care of offspring and society around them doing the exact same thing in the exact same environment under the exact same boring conditions: one long stretch of meaningless boredom, no wind to bring change, no rain to give it all a refreshing well needed rinse. No connection to where their food is coming from or to who is handling the trash, with a big tv in the living room airing nothing but hypnotising mindless content. The child as a predator where days feel like years and years feel like days. The child as a given fact when you are moving into suburbia, no other choice than to raise the child. The car is the vehicle that could bring the couple to another life outside of suburbia, but they get stuck, energy drains and is running on empty. The child as this force which is taking all the energy from the parents for him to find gasoline, the energy to transport himself out of suburbia only for him to find a new couple to repeat this whole bourgeois suburb life. The child here then also symbolises the invisible force of unwritten social code (at one point he literally brings a book to the mother with unreadable code and technical drawings, making her none the wiser).

While delivering countless memorable moments, some terrifying, some confusing, some bitter, they always seem just as small and lost as the little family we are watching. It never comes together because the movie doesn't find it's own language; it jumps from subtle to in-your-face like it jumps from being a drawn out metaphore right into regular TV weekend mystery territory.And unfortunately it does not have a lot to deliver on both fronts and never builds up to anything. It carefully prepares moments that never come. It meanders around it's messages up to the point where you wonder if it even has any. Given the overall high technical marks, where pretty much everyone does a great job, it's almost wasteful.At the very least it built enough suspense to watch it until the very end, and there is an great, eerie atmosphere that will linger even after you are done, but if you are looking for any kind of gratification, this is a hard miss.",Vivarium

It starts out well, but unfortunately it turns into the old story of ""We had a great concept, but we didn't know where to go with it.""I've read some discussion suggesting it's all supposed to be a metaphor for the societal expectation of couples to devote their lives to bringing up children, having it be a soul-sucking, pointless experience that wastes their lives and then they die. I could easily imagine this is the metaphor but, if it is, I'm more worried about the people that see the world that way, than anything else. However, I don't _think_ that's the idea. Given the Cuckoo concept, it doesn't really fit.Essentially it's Village of the Damned (based on John Wyndham's book, ""The Midwich Cuckoos""), pared down to a single child, with the parents being transplanted into a simulated environment, rather than the children/child being placed in the parent's world.After that intriguing start, the film meanders a bit. Gemma and Tom don't seem to ask the obvious questions, or attempt the obvious actions. Can they break into the other houses? If not, why not? The first box with the child states ""Raise the child and you will be released."" - They then receive regular boxes of supplies. Why not leave replies on the return boxes, and attempt bargaining with the captors? ""Define 'released' or we will not feed the child."" or likewise other demands, such as books or other items. That doesn't mean these tactics would work, but from a writing perspective you have to at least acknowledge the protagonists _attempts_ at such solutions. When Gemma is trapped outside, why doesn't she break a window? We already know the house can be damaged. When the house is burnt down, it is repaired when they wake up. Following this, why is the hole Tom digs, left for him to dig deeper each day? If the creatures aren't bothered about his involvement with the child at this point, why keep him alive at all?The child 'disappears' at regular points, the implication being that it leaves the house to spend time with the others of its kind that it is learning from. They never try simply locking it in its room, so that it can't have this influence, or perhaps simply to provoke a reaction from their captors because it can't walk away to see them. Once it brings back the book, why not contain the child until it helps them understand the language? Or at least attempt it...On top of these issues, the characters actions often feel a little disjointed. Gemma and Tom never really talk about the whole situation, they just kind of 'react' occasionally, but their actions feel more about what the writer wants them to do in that moment, rather than how the characters would act (not that they're especially defined to begin with, admittedly).By the end of it, both characters essentially just 'give up' and seem to die of exhaustion (though Tom's death could also be related to some kind of lung infection after his hole-digging, when he decides to dig down into the garden, to see if there's a bottom).Then the 'grown' child goes off to replace the estate agent who showed them there, in a nightmarish loop. That conclusion is probably the most frustrating element of the whole film. We've all seen the 'nightmare short-story' ending a million times. It's _exactly_ what we expect. It also, as with most such stories, undermines the whole film. What was the point? It's merely a deflating ""Why did I bother watching."" conclusion, rather than something satisfying.I've said it before, but John Carpenter is the master of creating dark and cynical conclusions that _still_ leave you satisfied. Perhaps Gemma and Tom escape somehow, but the 'child' still survives to continue the cycle? Perhaps Gemma and Tom turn the tables, and once Gemma discovers the route into the 'other' houses, and since they can't escape this world, they begin slaughtering the other 'children' and gathering the other 'parents' as they go? Two very simple endings, both still in a dark, nightmarish vein, and thought up in five minutes on conclusion of this review. Both more satisfying and less obvious than what we got.Ultimately, Vivarium is actually more frustrating because of its potential. It's a great concept that just goes nowhere interesting...",Vivarium
209,Shuggy,A classic,9,1 August 2019,"SF? Fantasy? A personable young househunting couple are abandoned by a creepy estate agent in one of a development of identically uninspiring empty houses. Though the sun shines and similar fluffy clouds dot the sky, it's strangely claustrophobic. Their basic needs are taken care of, but they are given an unexpected task that grows increasingly onerous. Their different reactions to this burden, and to each other's reactions, give the movie substance. The climax and resolution are splendid, but this is NOT a feel-good movie.I think it's a classic (maybe not just a cult classic),. In his Q&A, writer/director Lorcan Finnegan referred to The Quiet Earth, Magritte, Escher and many more. Someone else has referred to The Truman Show, but to me the elephant in the room was Village of the Damned (based on, um, The Midwich Cuckoos). Yet its admixture of these themes keeps it from seeming derivative.",Vivarium

More importantly though, this is a film that will leave you wanting to scream at the characters for their utterly inexplicable behavior. Obviously if they did not behave so irrationally the story would no longer function, so the film had to show us characters behaving bizarrely, but that doesn't really make it any better. It is difficult to imagine humans behaving the way they do in this film, and the incredibly unclear timeline doesn't help. I've given it a 5 because it was an interesting premise and it did manage to hold my attention for the whole run time, but there really isn't any pay-off at the end for sticking with it.

223,sagniknath,Had some good ideas here and there but....,6,1 April 2020,"I chose to rent this movie for $6 on YT based solely on the lead actors being Jesse and Imogen . I followed their on screen chemistry in two previous films (The Double and Art of Self Defense) and found them likable as a couple in both of them.This led me to see their performance here as well.Before I go over my criticisms, I will say that this film really tries to be different from the norm. More than sci fi, I would say this film borrows more heavily from the philosophical ideas of Spanish writer Jorge Luis Borges. Borges would often allude the idiosyncrasies of daily life to fantastical and impossible scenarios. He was also quite fascinated with the theme of infinity or redundancy in his short stories. Without going into spoilers, I can say this film follows a similar theme of infinite repetition of life, equating the daily problems in rearing a family to the myth of Sisyphus. There is no respite from it.
Also, I liked the look of the film. The colors they used sort of helped accentuate the sensation of vapidity in the lives of the protagonist. In fact, besides the two human characters played by Imogen and Jesse, the vapidity of living in a society as a family is personified as a third character.However, I fell that given such an interesting premise, the writers could have worked a bit more on the material. Both Jesse and Imogen felt like blank slates. We knew nothing about their characters before or even after the end of the movie. It would have helped to get some context on their relationship and their own personal motivations . I was seven more confused with Jesse's role. I think he wanted to shake off his ""nerd"" image and be more of a butch in this role; however it comes off as being very confusing. Is he supposed to be assertive or mild mannered, smart or dull. I really couldn't get a grip on his character.Also, at the end of the film, even though I got the film's central message, I still didn't feel I got a well earned satisfying conclusion. And I think this ties directly to the notion that the two characters were underwritten. If they had personal good arcs, maybe I could have appreciated the film more.",Vivarium

233,kaneeddy,"Excellent world building and concept, but collapses in the third act",6,16 April 2020,"Vivarium, is an intriguing film that builds a lot of interesting pieces throughout its story, the performances from Jesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots are solid. the films biggest strength comes from its world building, we see a story built on imagery and careful cinematography. the concept it has is very unique and I liked the way it was explored throughout its first two acts, building a tense atmosphere and surrounding us in an environment that is sickly perfect, as the director states: The area that the characters are trapped in is one which humans dream of: A nice quiet neighbourhood, and a family, however it lacks the love and soul that the experiences of human life bring to these places, which creates that eerie atmosphere. The director succeeds in implementing that vision and praise must be given for that.However, the thing that truly annoys me about this film is its third act, it seems to be a film that stacks all these dominoes and you're waiting for all of them to fall, but they never really do, leaving us with a lacklustre ending, where it seems the director was trying to leave the story up for interpretation, but in the meantime, it doesn't feel as if it has earned that right yet, as they don't really give you enough information to go off to give a decent interpretation. I appreciate the risk that the film was attempting to take but it falls short of being truly captivating and giving us something to spend hours talking about, instead giving us an experience that was decent but doesn't transcend that barrier.Overall, Vivarium has decent performances, cinematography and world building but the storytelling falters, making me underwhelmed and wishing it had been just a little bit better, where it could have been truly great.

You know nothing about them or the world around them but it just goes full bore into this inescapable neighborhood. From there it just falls apart and next 70m you see them flounder in this world full of questions but zero answers.

242,andrewhumphreys9968,Vivarium - 5/10,5,22 September 2020,"The overly-pessimistic worldview at the core of this surreal, indie horror left a bit of a sour taste. I can normally get on with a film that might be a bit cynical, but the underlying allegory in ""Vivarium"" felt a bit basic and a little too miserable to enjoy.The movie sees Imogen Poots and Jesse Eisenberg play a couple who, on the hunt for a new house, go with a strange realtor to an even stranger neighbourhood for a showing. Once they arrive, the realtor disappears and they find themselves trapped in the pale-green, suburban nightmare. If that wasn't bad enough, they soon find a baby in a box that rapidly ages into one of the most annoying little brats I've ever seen in a movie.Eisenberg's not my favourite actor, some movies I've really enjoyed him in, others he's almost insufferable. Thankfully, he doesn't really fall into either category here and just sort of cruises along while Imogen Poots does all the good bits. In fact, if it wasn't for Poots' performance, I think this would've been far less watchable, especially since it's pretty obvious what's to come as soon as you see Senan Jennings' character for the first time.Jennings plays the kind of creepy, but mostly annoying, kid that Poots and Eisenberg are forced to raise. I can get past the shaky acting in some scenes because he's just a kid, but the multiple bouts of screaming were too much for me. One thing I will say, I didn't think I'd ever enjoy seeing a grown man body-slam a child, but there's something Vivarium's good for.The logistics of how the movie's cyclical events unfold are all well and good, but there's no explanation as to why they're trapped there and being forced to raise this inhuman child. I think the film's too focused on getting the allegory across that it forgets to explain itself sometimes where it probably should.You can work out where the film's going long before it even thinks about coming to an end, but it's surreal and intriguing enough to still be watchable. There's not much payoff which is unfortunate, but I'd say this is still worth the watch. One scene I did enjoy was when Poots chased the now-grownup version of the kid under the curb - the way he scampered away was pretty creepy and it really fit the surreal tone of the film.",Vivarium

256,opiaterein,Deliciously bizarre,9,3 April 2021,"I'll open by saying, Im not sure I have ever met someone who would enjoy this film like I did. I can't say it feels totally original - I couldn't help feeling echoes of The One I Love, despite there being zero obvious plot parallels. It just has a similar feel of walking out of the normal world and into a passive aggressive nightmare. Both have a delightful dark humor despite being a special kind of terrifying.In response to other reviews: no, this couldn't have been a short film, not without GUTTING the main characters and everything genuinely human about the film. Part of what makes the subtle horror work at all is that we feel how trapped and suffocated these normal people are in this supremely effed up cuckoo's nest. Neither is this film anything like any episode of Black Mirror. Twilight Zone for the modern age, maybe, but not at all Black Mirror. This movie isn't about technology and the way humans use it.I think some people are disappointed that the ending didn't have the same humor as the second act, but I feel like the first act was fine preparation for what was to come.Bottom line, you've gotta be a special kind of weird to get into this movie (I think being British might help), and extra weird to really love it.

262,Reviewer746,reading the positive reviews doesn't reveal the film's true theme,2,29 June 2021,"The positive reviews of Vivarium fall into two categories.The first camp, representing the clear majority, is convinced that the film is allegorical and meant to depress us with a story about raising an unwanted child in the endlessly bland and inescapable suburban hellscape of the UK. You can forgive people for thinking this since all of the symbolism, the dialogue, the cinematic style, every aspect of the film in fact indicates that it's a criticism of the suburban life cycle. Our heroes are literally trapped amongst endless rows of depressing, identical houses, raising a child they didn't really want and weren't ready for. The mother attempts to care for the child while the father works a meaningless job digging his own grave. Finally their child buries them in the same house and the cycle repeats. You can't blame people for hoping that the movie has some sort of meaning.Now, our second camp of positive reviewers have seen their share of nature documentaries and they know that the common cuckoo is a brood parasite which allows or forces other bird species to raise their young. These reviewers have seen the light, read the secret meaning between the lines and they're convinced this makes the movie better somehow. All of that obvious suburban symbolism, and indeed the name of the movie itself, was just there to trick you - the movie actually has no meaning, it's just a silly alien thriller and that's what makes it great!Alas, the movie is neither a worthwhile commentary nor a thrilling sci-fi horror. As an allegory, it fails to be poignant. As a thriller it fails to be thrilling. One B sci-fi concept does not a good movie make.",Vivarium

This movie simply didn't develop and I lost interest about half way in. To me, it seemed that this movie symbolized how people are conditioned to a storybook life: many have that fantasy of having kids and finding the perfect suburban home without realizing the emotional burden that comes with it. Often times parents are unprepared to have a kid and have no idea how to raise it.I think Eisenberg was a poor casting choice, he's incredibly flat and has no range. Imogen Poots did a good job -- overall the two main actors had no chemistry. This movie really could have been condensed into a Twilight Zone or Magic Mirror type format. It got repetitive and non-sensical the longer it dragged on.

Though it doesn't quite live up to my expectations it is still highly recommended just on sheer originality alone.
Eisenberg is always terrific in just about everything he does but it seems that he really rises to the top of his game when the material challenges him and his audience. I really like some of his more ""out there"" type of movies with a few being some of his most underrated but also being some of my all time favorite movies ( The Double, America Ultra.)
Eisenberg and Imogen Poots bring their A Game to what is basically a two man horror show with some big laughs and some even bigger scares.
Tight direction and amazing set design but at 97 minutes it's about a half an hour too long. It's a good and very different movie, still highly recommended but it would have made an outstanding episode of Black Mirror or Jordan Peele's new Twilight Zone.",Vivarium

When the two try to leave the labyrinth-like area, each road mysteriously brings them back to their starting point in a sort of infinite spatial loop.The movie is carried by the excellent performance of leading actors Imogen Poots and Jesse Eisenberg. Albeit interesting on paper, the story and intrigue work more as metaphor of suburban life than an sci-fi/horror/mystery story and probably would have worked better as a short more than a full length picture (e.g. A Black Mirror episode).

Jesse and Imogen are the camera's darlings for the full runtime, with no other notable cast to speak of except ""the child"" (no, not that one).Is it a commentary on the existential anxiety of domestic life? Is it a dark take on child rearing? Is it a critique of the American dream? Is it a science experiment? A bastard twilight zone episode gone long? You will wonder all these things at some point, and the wondering is largely in the movie's favor, as it's hard not to feel impatient for the curtains to lift on our lovable protagonists.There are moments of dread and well-played anguish, but an undercurrent of hyperbole and metaphor keep you thinking this could all be a dream-an alter-reality plot twist in the making, in which our heroic leads will wake up to find its Christmas morning and Tiny Tim isn't dead.So, is there a payoff? Not like you might hope. You will probably feel like the closing moments are suitably unnerving and provocative, but you will certainly furrow your brow later as you think back on the many aspects and nuances of this story that are never truly fleshed out, likely by design.Like it's philosophic premise, the plot will leave you struggling to find meaning in all the mess, and while the movie delivers well in this area, it, like the philosophy it touts, may ultimately feel a bit unfulfilling, despite the wonderful people and scenery.",Vivarium

For me personally it's an interesting exploration of the mysticism surrounding suburban life. We see a lot of defferent types of symbolism in it. The movie tries to tackle the issues of family life, parenthood and modern day working life cycle. It has a charming art style with an interesting color scheme. I accept the fact that it looks a bit corny, but for me this compliments the vibe of the movie. Eisenberg isnt doing anything special or new but that's perfectly fine with the type of character he is playing here. Poots is really pushing a dramatic performance, but in my opinion this movie is so self aware that it doesn't really need it. The performance I liked the most was that of Hardwick, who is making his first steps in the field of acting. Cold and distant, his acting made me believe he really isn't human. The climax, which so many dislike is perfectly fine for me. Of ourse the monologue of Eisenberg was stretched out and we saw his death coming a long time ago, but still the revelation that the child is a supernatural creature holding them there until their deaths worked fine for me. We got a couple of great elements and the whole atmosphere was sweet and warm. Perhaps too sweet for its own good. Nonetheless I think it's a charming little film which is executing it's tasks perfectly fine. I would surely see it again.",Vivarium

Idea of being trapped in outer parts of town was fine that no matter how near or close they drove, they drove in circles and returned back to the house of no. 9.

It's obvious, cause they don't and would never understand it!
Cycle of life as it is true for ordinary ones and it is mentioned in Vivarium, is not what rich or overrated optimistic people tell us about! The savage all day effort for making a good living or just getting away of that hard disgusting situation which is made by those who promise a great life to us, finally leads us all to death without approaching even a bit and consumes all days, months and years of our life without our intention and desire for it, As Jemma mentioned once in Vivarium; the only thing they wanted was to buy a house!
Cycle of life nowadays is savage for most humans, but is not seen by rich in one way(which can be reformed of course, but needs more humanity sense) and by greedy awful lying promisers in another way, they just get back to their greedily instincts of forcing people to do something even by telling them beautiful wicked lies, they're like aliens and not humans, like those Martins of Vivarium who just replace the last one and keep doing the same job, cause they're aliens of disgusting inhumanity instincts...This terrible cruel life that we made for ourselves in this world and force poorer ones to keep running along us, will finally make them die and makes us to become some kinds of species who are not humans anymore!Lastly, I think we may say to those who think Vivarium is a bad movie and ask us about the point of it, as Joker told that psychologist in Gotham madhouse: ""You Wouldn't Get It!""",Vivarium

The book in a weird language. The television with its one channel that looks like Wassily Kandinsky meets Istvan Banyai. The strawberries that have no taste. The grass suddenly shriveling up. The robotic nature of the salesman. The weird clouds.

Vivarium is a strange yet compelling story about a couple who are lured into a labyrinth like neighbourhood of identical houses by an odd real estate agent with otherworldly motives. What lies beneath this wildly uneasy premise is a pessimistic allegory on the suburban life cycle. The downright bizarre nature of the films narrative does inevitably spawn complications in terms of plot, and the conscious decision to not reveal answers towards the resolution has the potential to alienate its viewers. However, the film does invite audiences to engage in conversation and to speculate theories on what it all meant. I love how the film trusts our imagination to fill in the gaps while still feeling complete for what it was trying to achieve.What really stands out is the world in which the film creates. The uniquely mundane production design and attention to diegetic reality assists in creating a dread inducing atmosphere. The mind bending dream logic adds to the feeling of hopelessness and isolation. This is also accomplished through the Stylistic choices in editing and cinematography.I found the role of Jesse Eisenberg's character to be a somewhat refreshing detour from his usual annoying antics and Imogen Poots really steals the show with her gut wrenching performance.
I have read reviews criticising the concept to be in the likes of black mirror or a twilight episode and is much rather suited for a 30 minute short, which is fair enough but a 30 minute duration just wound't do the film justice. I preferred the slow building of tension and unraveling of plot. Most importantly I was invested throughout the entire runtime.Ultimately Vivarium is a very creative experiment on the human condition and does provoke thought with its outlandish ideas. Its difficult to express my opinion without spoiling the movie, I will recommend movie-goers to go into the film blind and refrain from watching the trailer or reading into the synopsis. It will for sure divide audiences and is by no means for everyone.",Vivarium

301,damfaz,Seriously?,5,7 June 2020,"I think that this is a bad movie because it highly pretends to communicate something which is not believable. Let's go into details.First of all, the movie lasts 90 minutes, but 10 minutes would have been sufficient to tell us that life is terrible.Many of us are already scared of cohabitation, and this movie definitely destroys every hope in life as a couple. The only aim of the couple seems to be raising that annoying robot-child, and nullifying them as human beings just to feed him with those damn cereals. Moreover, this movie describes human life as a foolish tragedy: we live just to raise our children. Once they have become autonomous, our existence makes no longer sense. The only thing we can do is die. Seriously? Come on, this is too exaggerated.At least, the man's behavior is consistent with its character: he spends all his time by digging in the hope of finding a way out. The mum's mother instinct is sometimes high, sometimes understandably non-existent. Should we interpret this as if fathers don't have any aptitude for family life and mothers are there just to feed us? Again, seriously?Now I try to neglect the moral of this story. It is not even a good movie because basically nothing happens, and both characters die in the end. So, it is just a waste of time.The only thing that I like is the pretty picture. At least, geometry and colors transmit the emptiness of that fictious world in a good way.",Vivarium

303,zbsdeizux,Not worth it,5,29 November 2020,"I can picture a bunch of film critics having a field day/an intellectual debate about the hidden layers of meaning of this movie. Even if there is a hidden meaning though, I don't think it matters that much, as their message is an entirely negative one.There was always the sense of impending doom throughout the movie, you always feel as though something terrible is just around the corner. It made me feel uneasy. I read a newspaper article that said the movie was based on a short - it did feel as though the movie was dragged out unnecessarily. It felt like an agony to watch (maybe that was intended), but there were unnecessary scenes that added nothing of value to the plot (brushing teeth, sitting on the toilet). Maybe that should spark a dialogue about the horrors of suburban life?The movie felt like it was made by someone who really detests children, someone who would donate all their money to Planned Parenthood in a heartbeat. The plot makes it look like there's nothing worse on earth than raising a child. I wonder if the ending had turned out differently if they had showed the child some love? Probably not, but the fact that they dehumanized the child and called it >it< just made both characters unlikeable to me.The alien part is just exaggerated and made me roll my eyes. They're all evil and out to get us for sure... it's such a cliché. It doesn't help that I don't believe alien life will ever make it to Earth.The time you're investing in this movie is probably not worth it. I feel like someone stole precious time from me.

The entire movie appears to nudge and provoke the psych without giving many conclusions and leaving the audience to interpret the movie in a variety of different ways. In other words. Thought provoking. Since there is a trend these days for action movies that are simply exercises in mindless destruction. I'm not surprised it would leave many people cold.

The situation of being suddenly bound to a place and having no chance to escape is interesting. Unfortunately, it also ends there.
Watching two people wandering along the street, only to end up in front of house number 9 again, has no entertainment value. Also the rest of the life in the ideal home can not inspire.
The appearance of the child is a moment in which you expect that there is now a little bit more drive into the matter. The cut from baby to toddler is merciless. Well, probably they did not want to torture the audience with another half hour of nothing.
The next 75 minutes are dull boredom, only interrupted by some screaming fits of the child, who obviously knows no other way to demand his needs. Even the couple's drifting apart doesn't really create any tension. After half of the movie I didn't care if they live or die.
When finally some more movement comes into the matter, it is so confusing that it brings no satisfaction.

At first the movie reminded me of the Twilight Zone episode ""Stopover In A Quiet Town"" where a couple awakens to find themselves in a town that is totally isolated and they can't find their way out. Same thing happens here. The odd realtor suddenly disappears and the couple is left at the home and is unable to drive out of the area.This is the kind of movie where you'll watch it and you'll stick with it only because you (just like me) are very curious to find out all the answers to the questions you have about what's going on. When the movie ended, I had to Google for explanation of the movie and its ending. I was a little more satisfied once I read all that, but it still doesn't excuse the movie for being so odd. Oh and when you watch this movie, you'll want to keep your remote volume buttons nearby.

But then again I'm a bit hard to disappoint in a film, as long as it's not really bad. With that being said though, this film is extremely hard to pinpoint for a specific audience. You could say it's for those that like the twilight zone, but fans of that show have already pointed out how needlessly long this film is, so that's a no. Could also say it has a lot of subtext in it, but people have already pointed out how obvious and in your face it is, so people looking for deeper meaning in their films don't like it much either. And then we get to the question: is it good? Which is also very difficult to answer because there's only 2 kind of people who watch this film: those that HATE it and those that love it. And the people that hate this film just really hate it, just look at the other reviews here, they are merciless. So, who is this film for? Well, for one, not casual audiences. The film is just too strange and bizarre for the casual viewer, so if you are one of them, maybe give this one a skip. If you are a more in depth viewer, and more specifically like thrillers and strange movies that don't answer all the questions like Donnie darko and the lighthouse, you might like this film. And the final person who might like this film are those just looking for an experiment piece. I'm sure a film student would love this film to death. Now with all of that out of the way, why did I like it? Well, the visuals were beautiful, the acting incredible, as well as the story being so bizarre that it's right up my alley.

349,Bilse85,Disturbing and depressive,6,5 November 2020,"IMPORTANT NOTICE:
If you choose to watch this, don't do it in lockdown.SPOILERS AHEAD:
This is a difficult one. Don't be fooled by the cuteness of the lead actors, the film is not funny. It is very depressing and disturbing. But not bad. I will talk about this later. But let me tell you this; in fact I could have given a higher note to this film because there is no specific fault in it but somehow it is difficult to rate higher. Maybe because of the fact that it is pointless. And I am not saying this as an insult. The film itself is saying that right from the start. The little girl in the school yard was asking ""why?"" and her teacher answered that it is the nature. The same thing can be said regarding the motivations of the aliens (I presume) in the film. Actually their actions are the mirror images of the bird in the opening scenes.
So this film is not a mystery, it is an open book. There is no great philosophical meaning behind. It is just their nature to behave this way. I guess if one tries really hard, they can find symbolism here and there but to me the main theme was only this.And as a low budget - low concept science fiction film it is rather successful in its genre.
However, oh boy, it is so depressing. So long. Excruciating in some ways. If it were a short that would not help much either. Because the idea is so unpleasant, it would still create the same negative sensation.
To sum up, it is not bad, just hard to look at.

358,wesleyvanauken,Definitely worth a rewatch for me.,9,10 June 2020,The first time through this movie I was solely focused on the surface level narrative that is obviously being portrayed here of the couple and their problems in this situation. But once the final credits rolled and the end song was playing (by XTC from the punk rock '70s a great choice) I realized that there was more going on here. There is definitely a symbolic story of our modern society's struggles with raising children in a world where our hard work to teach them right from wrong can be co-opted in the blink of an eye by different media outlets and radicalizing internet forums. The final song nailing home that the struggle is similar no matter which side of the political divide you're on. A very well made movie. This is scifi.

This is some kind of brilliant and profound statement about some kind of prescient social issue...and if you complain about it being pretentious, you just don't know how to have fun!As much as some ideas were interesting here, this movie is a dull slog filled with overacting, not convincing special effects, constant waffling on vague philosophy and mostly just bored, grouchy looking people in dimly lit rooms staring into space.The only real attention paid was to making the film look pretty, and it does at times, but the over stylization takes away from any potential feeling of real peril.If it was supposed to be profound, don't make it so silly.

But the moment the boy enters this film... It just starts going way downhill. I watch a lot of films and this one really made me want to throw something at my tv as the boy was just that part of the film who didnt belong and you wanted to remove him from your tv.There was absolute no reason for Tom to even contemplate of digging a hole besides his relation to being a gardener, beyond that - he had 0 purpose or insight as to how he thought it could help his situation. Once his storyline concluded with whats at the end of the hole the movie had already revealed how it would end and it kind of pissed me off, knowing I could have walked away from this film when I should have to find how redundant and meaningless the whole film was. We know they are there for over 270+ days so what I want to ask the director is.. Did not one other couple or single person looking for a new home go into the shop during that full duration?? Like cmon...I honestly think the only purpose of this film is to question ourselves, how would we react to a child we have absolute no control over, beyond that dont even bother.

364,williamrbabcock,Story and logic sacrificed for one reason.,5,8 December 2020,"I watched this movie the other day and it stayed with and I couldn't decide if it was in a good way or bad way. After digesting it for a few days I landed upon a bad way. The movie itself has an interesting premise and a bizarre, surreal feel about it, but that can't save the movie from getting lost in the point it's trying to make; children are parasites the suburban life is a wash, rinse, repeat cycle. At least that's what I took away from it. I feel the film suffers because the writer/ director was so dead-set on making that point that everything else became ancillary. I would say the first half of the movie was good. It established the characters and the world fairly quickly and to the point, but then one the kid shows up, it gets weird, the inconsistencies show up as well. The kid was creepy, I'll give them that, but the way the relationship between the two characters and the way they handled the child, especially the woman, became annoying. ""i'm not your fucking mom"". ""You can't leave him in the car."" And then the little things bother me, like they paint ""HELP"" on the roof in white paint, then another scene its shows ""FUCK YOU"" written on the roof. What happened to the help? Did they wash it off? There was no trace of it. Yes, that's a nitpick, but still, irksome. Then the whole ""I have to dig a hole"" plot device just so they could make the point that suburban life is nothing more than digging you own grave so your children can bury you, was quite forced. Then the thing that really bothered me was when he found the body in the hole. I mean, really? I am all for coincidence in a movie, BUT, that one was a little too convenient. Basically, someone else was trapped there, found out the grass was fake, had a shovel, decided to dig a hole, and then died in the EXACT SAME SPOT? Nope. And back to the whole suburbia point; why the hell would the aliens (or whatever) build an entire neighborhood and leave it all empty except for one house? That makes no sense. Again, nothing more than a plot device. The other thing that bothers me is there seemed to be no other explanation for the characters to die other than, ""Well, that's the life cycle in suburbia hell"". That didn't sit well with me either. And then the one kind of really cool scene at the end where she chases the alien into the alternate/ parallel areas where other people are seen in her same situation ultimately delivered nothing. I suppose what bothers me is that there is no real revelation, no reason. Yes, the very end shows the ""reason"" why the aliens are doing it, but it wasn't really a reason. Why did the aliens need the humans to raise the child? again, going back to the life cycle, reason and story telling your bypassed to make a point. And from what we get from the movie, this supposedly takes place on earth. How? Where? How could something like this stay hidden and how could only the aliens get in and out? Some kind of reveal or explanation there would have been nice. Something like in The Signal. It would have explained away some of the faults the film had. I gave it 5 stars because of the acting and because of the creepy kid and because it looked good, but as Paul Hollywood of the Great British Baking show would say, ""This was style over substance"".",Vivarium

370,barrywomb,Really Enjoyed this CreepyA** Movie,8,6 August 2020,"What an ODD movie this is. In a good way. Many people have likened it to a Twilight Zone episode. I totally agree. While the 'payoff' was a BIT scattered for me, the lead up to it was very cool and very eery.This is a creepy movie without gore. Without the typical scare thing (things that pop out, people react, whatever). Just creepy. You've probably read the plot already, no need to recap. Kind of like a demented Truman show.While I've never been a big Eisenberg fan (there's just something quirky about him to me) he was good in this (and his Zombie flicks). Funny that this role almost went to Corey Feldman. Whoa.For me, the kid (Senan Jennings) and the 1st realtor (Jonathan Aris) steal this movie. The kid is so darned creepy. No Damien, No Linda Blair Exorcist, no Children of the Damned - those were gimmicky and pretty silly by today's standards of scary kids. This kid and the way they wrote him and the way he delivered his lines and did his VOICES was superb to me. So 'OFF' that it was guaranteed to rub one's scary spot without the splatter. It was such a great casting decision.The 1st Realtor, in a very different way, also had a similar vibe, but he was more robotic. Normally not good. But here, it was a great touch. Saying stuff and acting in a manner that just didn't fit in the normal world worked beautifully here. Between the kid and the realtor being weird and the 2 main characters being pretty normal, it created a great juxtaposition.There were some things that would've been nice to explain (the TV, the book) but BECAUSE they remained a mystery, it ADDED to the story in my opinion.If I had to cite one 'miss' it would be for the grown boy. He acted a bit sinister where he really shouldn't have. After all, the first realtor wasn't like that, nor was the boy. (I mean they were sinister, but not in an overly intentional 'scary' way).The fact that people complain that it's slow or no action...
I miss the days of long attention spans.BTW- Check out the Trivia on IMDb about this movie. Have a look at the Avian Brood Parasite passage. It explains the movie and the opening bird sequence really well.Finally- Dear Movie Makers...
Is it REALLY NECESSARY to have your logo animations and then the text for those animations at the start of a movie? This movie had like 20 of them. I'm waiting for a movie of just logos. If there's an animation, why list it again right after. All movies do this, but this one had a ton.",Vivarium

It wasn't long after his introduction that I was wishing bad things would happen to him.As I said before, this is not your usual film by any stretch of the imagination. Go into it knowing that you are in for something ""way out there"" and you might enjoy the ride.The reason this film worked for me is that it shows us that hell is anywhere we can't escape from; the deprivation of liberty no matter what form it takes.

384,selfedluke,Like a really bad 90 minute Black Mirror episode,1,18 August 2020,"Felt like a really bad episode of black mirror stretched out as a feature length movie. The plot starts with a young couple approaching a real estate salesmen to ask about buying a first home. Apparently the couple has never had an independent thought before, because they seem totally disinterested in getting a suburban home before meeting this guy yet they go along fully with the over the top-weird salesmen who just stares at them, makes weird noises, and then suddenly declares ""I'm selling you this home now"" and the couple just shrugs and agrees to buy the property despite zero discussion.Now it starts to get really ugly. The director clearly wants/tries to pivot the movie into a horror/surreal drama once the salesmen suddenly runs away after dropping them off at the home. So the couple then launch into some of the most unbelievable dialogue and poor acting I've seen in recent memory. They try to leave the community, and after driving down one street and getting lost the man freaks out and acts like they've been stranded for days and screams at his wife as he demands to drive out of there himself. His emotional breakdown is so sudden and undeserved I just cracked up laughing. And because of the terrible cinematography and editing choices we never get to feel like this moment is authentic escape from anything. A crappy drone montage tries to show them driving against a inescapable suburban maze but it's shot with the same two blocks rotating around and then cutting to a bland shot of the two in their car, so we never feel any tension or belief that they are actually stuck in this surreal maze and not just being idiots.The rest of the movie is 1 hour of tedious dialogue, little tension, and laughably try-hard attempts at intellectual symbolism around a message that modernity is an inescapable hell full of fake people, fake communities, and alienated families toiling purposely in a consumer society.I'd rate the movie a 3 but the ""point"" of the movie the director attempted to covey is so poorly done that I decided on a 2, not even mentioning that the message itself is a dumb sophomoric take on life. Director needs to realize most people over 30 move to suburbs for a reason: ie they are affordable places to enjoy a easy going life of family, saftey, privacy and leisure. Reminds me of when I was angsty about modern life/capitalism/traditional lifestyles when I was in college and thought everyone in the suburbs was secretly drowning and miserable when really it was mostly just me.TLDR: a bad CGI satire of suburban community with dumb writing and little dramatic tension.

388,sven-koehler,this is a little science fiction gem,8,3 August 2020,"The film shows us the behavior of cuckoo chicks. Beside undeniable similarities, the story of the film is somewhat different.Here, a couple is taken hostage in a world that defies the laws of physics to some degree. The whole point is that the couple is to rise the offspring of some unknown species. The offspring obviously has the desire to imitate, but it doesn't seem to understand the human behavior sometimes. The offspring is eventually raised to a level that allows it to enter human society and ""recruit"" more potential parents for more offspring.The beauty of this film is not that we get shown some fancy alien world, but instead everything seems familiar but actually isn't. Food does not have taste, clouds look too much like clouds, walking towards the sun always takes you back to your own house, etc. Things are only slightly off, which just adds to the insanity.In spite of its low budget the film is well done. We get to experience the growing insanity of the couple. Imogen Poots gives a solid performance. Jesse Eisenberg is great as usual when he plays a slightly unlikable character.

The story of the movie exactly just like the definition of the tittleTHIS IS THE WHOLE POINT OF THE STORY (according to me): Alien (or whatever it is that abducted Tom and Gemma) can't raise their own offspring and need a human couple to help them to raise their own offspring just like the bird at the beginning of the story. And the bird that raise the baby bird (although the baby bird is not its child and this baby bird actually the one that killed the biological baby bird), can't do anything about it.The whole point of the movie explained entirely in this scene when a student of Gemma saw dead birds (The one that has been showing at the beginning of the movie). This is their conversation and the meaning of the conversation and the relation with the meaning of the movie itself:Student: S
Gemma: GS: Who did that to the poor baby birds? => this is we as an audience ask why the story punish both Tom and Gemma
G: I don't know. Maybe it was a cuckoo. => this is the Story explaining itself. The explanation is at the end of the movie when Gemma hit the Yonder's Boy
S: Why? => this is we as an audience ask the reason of that torture to Tom and Gemma and countless another couple in the story
G: Because it needed a nest. => this is the Story explaining itself.
S: Why doesn't it just make its own nest? => This is us again, asking the question
G: Because that's nature, that's just the way things are. => this is the Story explaining itself. We as an audience can't complain because that's just the way things are
S: I don't like the way things are. They're terrible. => This is us again, at the end of the movie, hated the Story so much. So many plot hole (you can read the plot hole at the end of this review) and so many unanswered questions make us feel incomplete when leaving the theater after seeing the movie
G: Well... it's only horrible sometimes. => this is the Story UNABLE TO explaining itself. This is why the logic of the movie is so low according to me. The story can't explain it self and only stating the statement that it's only horrible sometimesThough it's never made explicit in Vivarium's ending, the most obvious interpretation of Yonder and the strange boy that Tom and Gemma are forced to raise is an alien abduction story. The film opens with a shot of a newly hatched cuckoo pushing other baby birds out of the nest. This is a phenomenon in nature known as brood parasitism, in which some birds will lay their eggs in a stranger's nest in order to trick the other bird into raising their young. In Vivarium's opening, the cuckoo eventually becomes so large that when its unwitting adoptive parent returns to feed it, the cuckoo looks like it's about to consume the adult bird's head - foreshadowing the movie's ending.Vivarium takes the behavior of the cuckoo and reimagines it as an alien or extradimensional species that has invaded Earth and forces humans to raise its offspring by trapping them together in a ""nest"" (in this case, the house at No. 9 in Yonder). Just as some female cuckoos are able to lay eggs that resemble the eggs of the bird species whose nest they are left in, the boy's species is able to imitate humans closely, but not perfectly. Tom and Gemma notice something is off about Martin as soon as they arrive in the real estate office and observe his strange behavior, and the boy's voice definitely doesn't sound like a normal human child.Compounding the alien abduction theory is the strange alien language that appears in the boy's book and the patterns that appear on the TV, which are clearly communicating to him. At one-point Gemma asks the boy to imitate the person who gave him the book and he starts to transform, with bulging growths on his neck. Later, after she attacks him with the pickaxe, he gets down on all fours and scuttles like an animal - all of which points to him being an alien species in disguise. The impossible space that Gemma stumbles into when she tries to chase the boy at the end of the movie definitely seems like an alien construct, as does the impossible space of Yonder itself.Based on Vivarium's ending, it seems that these aliens age rapidly, growing to adulthood within a year (the boy looks about six years old after just three months) and declining from middle age to old age within the same space of time. They sustain themselves by trapping human couples in Yonder and forcing them to raise their weird children, and when a new ""Martin"" reaches adulthood, he replaces the old one. The aliens do not appear to form any kind of emotional attachments to their adoptive parents, and do not grieve for them when they dieTom and Gemma are literally stuck in this heteronormative structure of what a couple is ""supposed to do"" as they get older. Against their will, they have been forced into the suburban life, a home they despise, a routine they grow resentful of, and a child neither of them wanted. They are now stuck on a path for life that is both mundane and horrifying - one that ends in their deaths, with their bodies left to rot on the grounds of the house they hated. They aren't alone in this nightmare either, as the parallel worlds of Yonder reveal. This is the world that awaits us all, or at the very least, the white heterosexual middle-class couples to whom this fantasy is primarily sold to.Interestingly, Tom and Gemma never ask out loud why they have been trapped in the world of Yonder and its restrictive rules. They just get on with it because they have to. This is partly what makes Vivarium so fascinating: It is keenly aware of the smothering expectations placed upon people to adhere to societal norms, even as they become more unattainable and less desired by younger generations. Nowadays, we are less tied up by such conventions and it's far more normal for people, whatever gender they are, to remain unmarried, child-free, or off the property ladder, whether it be through choice or financial restrictions. Still, even today, it is that image of the happy suburban white couple with children and a mortgage that dominates the world and is deemed the default mode of life. Tom and Gemma were not picked to become a new part of Yonder for any other reason than because they were there, and that makes their fate all the more terrifying. It could happen to anyone.The most interesting and arguably the boldest aspect of Vivarium is in how it takes on the concept of parenthood. Here, to be a parent is to be forced into a one-sided parasitic relationship that will sap you of your very life essence. It is to be miserable and unfulfilled, to commit to something that will never make you happy or yield vaguely satisfying results. Tom and Gemma did not want a child but the society of Yonder demanded it, and the boy who grows in years as the days pass is unnerving, lacks imagination, and is utterly helpless without them. It's a blunt metaphor for the realities of parenting, but most stories end such narratives in a happy way, revealing how it was all worth it in the end.Vivarium doesn't do that. This is a film with the sheer guts to position the act of being parents as potentially the worst thing one could do with their lives, a mistake they will regret until they die. That remains one of society's last true taboos and Vivarium pulls no punches with it. Even when Gemma shares tender moments with the boy, she absolutely refuses to let him call her his mother. Her dying words to the now-grown boy are just that: ""I am not your mother."" It's a final act of defiance in the face of a world that took everything from her, and one that verbalizes countless people's lives, both within Yonder and in the real world.
PLOT HOLE:1. there's no explanation what the Yonder's boy really need actually from the human being. From the story itself, AUDIENCE ARE ABLE TO see that the Yonder's boy actually can raise its own kind. No need to established such a complicated vivarium in term of Yonder neighborhood and put a couple of human being in there in order to raise its own kind. Constant supply of food, electricity, etc., you named it. The Yonder's boy even can understand the TV channel in the other hand, the human couple that raise it, can't.2. there's no explanation why the Yonder's boy need to be exist in our world and what is its purpose.3. there's no explanation how the vivarium established in the first place4. there's no explanation why Gemma and Tom need to dieMajor failure in point number 1 above make the story pointless. Although as an audience we can get the meaning and associate it with our real-life condition but nevertheless, it is still meaningless.Truman show (starred Jim Carrey) is an example of vivarium but it is elegantly explaining the plot. The story (Truman Show) reveal itself and audience feel completed when leaving the theater after seeing the movie; whereas impossible to get the same feeling after watch this so-called Vivarium.
Just my 2 cents.

402,redres,was it a win for the makers of this film,6,29 March 2021,"I wonder if and when it went wrong with this film.Because the concept was there I guess. It is from a play.So it did not translate well enough for film?It is supposed to be surreal, but was there ever supposed to be a message?Or should it remain as an oddball.No explaining whatsoever in the end except that it looks like a viscious circle.I really feel some things where left out to keep it mysterously but if you had some other knowledge you would understand it better and maybe they where better expressed in the play.So anyway, the end is an anti-climax and feels like a sort off what's the point of it. Unless that is the point.I don't know, it does not make me feel I want to think deeper wich is the point if you want to make any point I guess.Strangely, I did feel the urge to write something about this interesting movie that may or may not have missed the point.",Vivarium
403,georjekc128,Ohhhh Kayyyy,4,27 March 2020,"Weird only for the sake of being weird. I'm easy on movies/people's creative efforts. I usually hand out 8s, 9s, and 10s as if they were Gummy Bears and Blo-Pop suckers for the kids on Halloween. On the rare occasion where I do dip below 5 stars I most often do what my mother always told me to do. If I can't say something nice...I don't say anything at all. And yet, here I am. Disappointed in the movie after 97 minutes of hoping it would offer some appreciable redeeming or artistic value (I strongly hesitate to criticize its artistic value since I myself can barely cut and paste) only to be sadly disappointed by its emptiness. How bad could it be I reasoned? After all my boy Jesse Eisenberg is in it and most of his movies are usually 8s... Aren't they?
Sorry, but I will not take the time to describe the storyline or plot to you. Instead I will recommend that you see the trailer on YouTube to get the feel and flavor of this movie and keep in mind that what you see is what you get. And that's all.",Vivarium
404,Nadara_G,"Great Concept, Good Execution, No Stroy!",8,28 March 2020,"So I will say right now this is the movie you watch for the execution itself. Acting, Metaphors, Ideas and the view. You will not be satisfied with the ending, you will not get what they wanted to tell you overall, you will like it while you are watching but when its over you will feel like you've wasted your time.The story begins but an ordinary couple trying to find a new home, they go to this weird salesman who takes them to the suburbs where every house is similar and just leaves them there. In the vast space and lots of houses they seem to be the only people living, they also get a child of sorts in a box and are asked to raise it. In the end they both die. That's it.However I did like the movie while I was watching it, it was very nicely done and I expected to get answers in the end which I really was curious about but you do not get any answers:
1. Who was the girl who advised them to get this house?
2. Who are the things that created this place?
3. What is this child?
4. What was the point of this?Aliens, robots, AI we never learn.I thing somebody just wrote a script about two people confined in a space forced to raise a child, but didn't have the ending, couldn't figure it out and still went with it.Overall, the movie is worth watching!",Vivarium

408,mayormcdeath,Great horro/sci-fi/comedy,8,28 March 2020,"How anyone could rate this movie below 5 is beyond me. This was a well made, clearly small budget indy movie. I can only say indy because it fits into: horror, comedy, drama and sci-fi categories all equally well. It is a weird, disorienting bottle drama that has decent performances from all the (few) actors involved.***SPOILERS BELOW***The story is about an unmarried couple who are looking for a house in an inflated housing market. They stumble upon this new housing development sales room, quickly get railroaded into going for a ""quick"" view of one of the houses in this new development and become trapped in a maze of look alike suburban streets. As the story evolves you come to learn that the couple has been trapped and essentially forced into raising.... something. The something starts as what looks like a baby but it quickly becomes something else, a mimic predator perhaps? All the while the couple cope with their captivity and run through a gambit of emotions, hating/loving each other intensely, hating/loving the child they have been forced into raising.The neighbourhood is creepily idyllic, the sky never changes with the same big puffy clouds, all the houses are exactly the same, and never another human in site.Personally I love movies that have their own vision and try something a bit different and don't just trope their way through 90 minutes of mediocrity. I feel some of the bad reviews are because the ending is not a happy one, I've noticed a correlational relationship with small movies on rating and whether it's a happy ending. Just my opinion anyway.In short I'd recommend this movie to anyone looking for something a bit different.",Vivarium

415,paularoger-94717,Like Driving Full Speed Into Glue,7,12 January 2021,"Liked it despite its quality of inescapable gloom. In one small way it is paradise, as advertised, in that they dont have to pay anything to be given their own home, and it is fully furnished. Furthermore no rent it charged, and every day they are given a box of food. Everything is taken care of. Just relax and spent your day relaxing even though there is no where to go and nothing to do. And that is the catch for these unfortunate hopefuls. The trap is spring and they cannot escape their cage, Vivarium or Yonder as it is called. I loved it, very quirky film with many surreal qualities. I liked the quirkyness of the salesman who uses every trick to get them to have a look at the house and suburb despite their serious doubts. Cant hurt to look can it?
The ""baby"" looks like a gift, until it starts screaming. Not nice. What do you do with such a child. What to do if its an alien? Does the child have logic?
I had hope that his digging would discover something. The body he found was revolting, of course. Why didnt they knock on other doors, or break in. Why didnt they discuss the nature of the trap/paradox? Setting fire to the house was a good idea, not that it worked.
Finally she escapes down a ""rabbit hole"" after attempting to kill the alien. Ooo bad move, it turns out to be a descent into madness and despair, not good for her psyche or her health. There's a message there.
Liked it but was disturbed by it. Yes it is a parable on life and the suburban trap. but also it hints at the evil spiritual realm that is around us all (christian world view). This is the nature of demons, and it reminded me of stories I have read of alien abductions and how manipulative aliens can be in these accounts. I found myself dereaming about it and brooding over it the next day. Good cinema, very good acting, too bad about the dead end. I believe life is more than this and has a way out.",Vivarium

now I didn't get to the end so I cant really tell you what happens at the end of the film but the start goes like this a couple wants to move into a new house so they go to this very strange estate agent and he shows them this house in a neighbourhood, which all the houses are exactly identical. so they get stuck in the neighbourhood and they cant get out.
So about halve an hour into the they get given a parcel with a child inside in it and they have to raise it in the house.

420,MamaPapaXP,"Like many works of art, you'll either get it, or not...",7,28 April 2020,"There are many artworkss I have come across I don't understand, or that grate on my eyes and ears, but I could never say 'this is the worst I've ever come across, I want my money or time back.' I just acknowledge I don't understand it and move on. The rhetoric used in many reviews here (and on other titles here) is nothing short of churlish and immature. I hope people with more rational minds can ignore the cancel culture reviews, use better judgement as to whether this film is worth their time or money and give equally fair reviews.That being said, I've given this a 7 (a 'good' but not 'great' in my personal estimation, your mileage may vary) and recommend this highly to lovers of noir fantasy/science fiction parables, or bleak social commentary framed in a Carrollian/Kafka-esque/David Lynch set-up. Many others, like me, may probably like, enjoy or appreciate it to varying degrees, but shouldn't 'hate' it.The two leads (Eisenberg and Poots) are quite up to the demands their predicament puts on them, and show a varied range of emotions and states. The supporting child actor, however, gives me the willies! If that wasn't his normal voice I was hearing, his mannerisms, posture and acting were still scarily on-point. (If that was his voice, however, his career should skyrocket.) As a 'family' their dynamic is both an exaggerated mirror of modern unprepared families, as well as a starkly portrayed descent into madness.Set design and overall production quality was obviously low-budget but very effective nonetheless. It perfectly evokes the subliminal nausea that modern suburbia often instills. You are asked to pay more attention to the tasteless food, the cookie cutter clouds and the pictures on the walls to better understand the complete lack of emotion or creativity of the antagonists, how completely different a species they are.The script is the only thing I knock a point off for. While it didn't do anything 'wrong', per se, I can agree with some reviewers that maybe, just maybe, some kind of clarification, exposition or slightly less bleak ending would make it more palatable to a much wider audience, but then we would be as remiss as if we asked Picasso to paint the whole face, or Jackson Pollock to join some of the dots up and give us a clue...

Let's start by saying, if you like sci-fi and love a metaphor with a load of symbolism thrown in, and you have some understanding of the way birds learn... then this is the film for you.There is a reliance on understanding that cuckoos are parasitic, from the first scene, and you do need to understand the premise that things in nature are preprogrammed to know what they need to do.You also need some appreciation of the artwork of Rene Magritte.There are many other themes in this, around the cycle of life, the misunderstanding of material possession by another species and the premise that a parasite will only keep the host alive as long as it is needed.I personally loved this film, but it is far more complex that you first may think.",Vivarium

The premise has been done before, couple are trapped in a labyrinth of identical houses with each escape attempt returning them 'home', only this time they are given a child and promised release if they raise it. It's an interesting situation watching how they manage their predicament and cope with a strange child they don't want or can relate to. The film has an insidious feeling of hopelessness and isolation which affects the characters behaviour in different ways. There's no plot other than them trying to make sense of their situation.

447,Fluzzy,10 stars for the first half. 1 star for the last half. = 5 stars,5,31 July 2020,"Loved this movie during the first half and was going to recommend it to my friends.
Finished the movie and I can't recommend it.Jessie Eisenberg's already brittle voice gets weaker and weaker toward the end.
This is not an artistic choice of an actor--he just has the same creaky, weak voice in every movie.Many things are left unexplained in the movie.
-Where do these realtors come from?
-Why in the movie does Imogen Poots walk like a man and dance like a man, what does this mean?
-What is the house made of?
-Why are the clouds cloud-shaped?The ending was unsatisfying. Many reviewers have said that it lacks meaning.
I don't know what the meaning is, but my biggest gripe is that it was unsatisfying.
Throughout the movie I wanted more and more for somebody to kill that thing.
Then at the end, the thing kills all the characters and we can see that it starts the cycle again with a fresh crop.
(spoiler alert)Interestingly, halfway through the movie I almost turned it off because I liked the movie so much (this has never happened). Unfortunately I watched it till the end and was hit in the face with a huge disappointment.In conclusion, the weakest parts of the movie are:
1. Jessie Eisenberg's strained acting (he's not cut out to be an actor because of his weak voice)
2. The middle through ending, where we see all the main character's actions being futile and even counterproductive (Jessie digs his own grave for most of the movie; I never saw that coming, probably many others did. (spoiler alert))The strongest parts of the movie are:
1. It's a beautiful movie, all the houses are color coordinated.
2. The acting from the bad guy...especially the first evil realtor Martin. That was AMAZING acting and I've never seen anything like it. Martin was played by Jonathan Aris, and he was the BEST part of the movie.
3. This movie is Kafkaesque, plain and simple. I used to love Kafka and Kafkaesque stories. Still do, but now I prefer unambiguous, unparadoxical happy endings.",Vivarium

The only real movie I could compare it to is the cube, in psychological terms, even though that movie is completely different, it really does make you think through the whole movie, and right till the end it still messes with your head, great actors, really good psychological thriller, not so much horror, 7.5 out of 10.",Vivarium

Mostly a work of art (which should explain the seemingly slower pace) and could have done better with a little more explanation around the extra terrestrial element involved. I would have given it another star had the part about the alien organisms would have been given a little more shape towards the end.The movie does get full points for originality of the storyline and concept.

If you pay attention, you can absorb the message presented of the tedious tasks of capitalism, suburbia, and the expectation of modern life which is constantly being shoved down our throats by media and society. The tone and setting are eerily disturbing without having to be stereotypically dull and dark. The story is interesting, and I was invested in the characters.

There is one scene that people who love this film will probably say is the climax. To that I would say it is too nonsensical to be climactic.

And he didn't care the end was left open ended either... but he does not deny these facts are true, it is slow and there is no definitive end.

In one of the most frightening scenes we watch how Gemma cunningly gains information about their captors from 'the boy' .'Pretend to be the person that you saw today'. Seeing her get the upper hand is soon torn away by the boys interpretation. I think this might be one of my favourite scenes in any film now, but its one of many beautifully crafted moments in this film.I loved the visual style and art direction. From the oddly rendered clouds and the model house designs complete with off-green colour scheme, the boys disturbing pitchshifted tone and dress, to the wonderful mesmerising 'language' on the television. The main characters look completely out of place in it, in their imperfection and increased ill and scruffy appearance.Its a original, well made and terrifying film, while barely showing a drop of blood and ( I believe) zero jump scares, its a cerebral story. The kind of horror that great playwrights like Pinter or Beckett might concoct...
But alas, it seems its mostly lost on much if the IMDB crowd.Its seems most people disliked this film, or at least were dissatisfied because they wanted answers. Some claiming these are 'plot holes', like they wanted to see the alien spacecraft flying off in the end or some derivative explanation of some inter-dimensional creatures that co-exist (or parasitically at least) with mankind, without our knowledge... or something.I love that I dont know. Thats whats terrifying and thats why (or at least a major reason) that my mind keeps wandering back to it. These creatures are just there and they are completely alien to us as Im sure most parasitic creatures are to other animal hosts. 'Why?' isnt important, its how the protagonists cope and survive. We reflect on how the humans react to the hopelessness of the situation, their motives and decisions seemed pretty accurate to how we would act (I saw The Blair Witch Project (1999) again recently, its a good film... but someone really should have started a fire as early as Tom had decided to) and, Im pretty sure if they had killed the child, they would have been presented with a new one the next day, no love lost on these creatures.Sometimes I feel people 'hate' films because they feel cheated by the horribleness of the subject matter, there is no winning for the victims dragged into this world, as its established in the beginning scene, the world can be terrible. I believe if a film affects you on an emotional level, they've probably done something right.Ill be keen to see more of Lorcan Finnegans work.",Vivarium

Of not knowing. Of not knowing about life. We're here, then we're not here. Plucked like the blind chicks from the nest.One of the most frequent criticisms of the movie is that it didn't go into more depth, didn't explain more, or provide more. For those expecting that it was slow, and not enough happening. But its part of the brilliance of this artwork, that the movie parallels the lack of meaning known in life. That life is a large unknown. That the only reasons life exists is to perpetuate life, For replacements, until human or other life doesn't exist. The movie captured the fate of life indelibly. .I couldn't imagine this movie being acted any better. All the contributions were excellent, and felt.If you watched this movie and didn't feel your own mortality, your own life's meaning flashing you didn't follow the message of this film. Or you were not wanting to. Which is understandable. This is the most emotionally difficult of films.This movie parallels the schoolgirl experiencing the horror of life and death. its about all of us, Metaphorically the chicks are us.

523,phoenix780-193-818687,Surrealistic view of the family unit,8,8 April 2020,"The movie Vivarium show us what it means to be alive or just exist. It asks the question - is it enough to have all the essentials in a family unit - a house (but not a home), food, a child? The answer is a big NO. You can have all of life's essential components to live, but not really be alive. When human contact with the outise world ceases to exist, our self validation also becomes extinct. When we live in a bubble, whether self made or not, our human senses grow weaker, and we as human's grow weaker.
The movie couldn't have been released at a more opportune time, during the Covid 19 Pandemic, when society right now is feeling alone and isolated. Right now the world is in our very own bubble or family unit, deprived of all but the essentials of life. Confined to the 4 walls of the BOX (movie metaphor) we live in. The movie's symbolism of the boy's bed with bars, the ladder that Tom climbs down, all prison bars in this surrealistic world that was built to be a perfect community, that turns out to be a living Hell. This perfect community where all the roads are the same and lead nowhere, and all the houses are the same reminds me of a communistic theory of life, which was supposed to be a more harmonies way of life, but turns out to be anything but that.
On another level is this a metaphor for a totally dysfunctional family. A cautionary tale if you will, about a family that desperately wants the American dream. The all American family, and gets a version of it that they weren't counting on. Their child, given to them, not born to them, is not the one they counted on. He embodies all the traits of an autistic child. This movie gives us a glimpse in the mundane, difficult, isolated life of a family trying to cope with an impossible situation with no relief from this horrible existence. This movie shows all the things that can go wrong as we travel along out path in life, seeking our perfect world. Also, the perverbial hole that Tom incessantly digs (reminds me of the dirt mound in Close Encounters of the 3rd kind that we see Roy Neary assembling - he is building, Tom is digging), is symbolic of the idiom ""you're digging yourself in a hole"", or ""you are digging your own grave"". He has gotten himself into a hole that he cannot get out of. As it turns out, he is literally digging his own grave.
Let us not forget what the word Vivarium means - an enclosure for keeping animals under semi-natural conditions for study or as pets. This movie is a study of humanity given just enough creature comforts for survival (the strange appearance of boxes with life's essentials) but nothing given for life's enjoument. All of life's joys are deprived - the food has no taste, the clouds have no shape, every house is exactly the same. Their only enjoyment was the one scene where the car radio still works, but that is short lived and distrupted by the strange boy.
Vivarium is definately something to ponder over. If you are looking for action this is not the movie for you, it is more of a nightmarishly, complex bizarre experience.",Vivarium
524,mx-85496,Twilight Zone it's not,3,23 March 2021,Equivalent to a really bad episode of the twilight zone.

525,Farshnoshket,It's a metaphor,8,10 December 2020,"At surface level this is definitely a whacky kind of science fiction. Nothing is making sense and by the end there is nothing to fill in the spaces. However, there are some films the viewer needs to participate in the thought process. Sorry to all those who just like to sit back, relax and get spoon fed, but this isn't that kind of film. I suppose the makers could warn people, but the whole idea of a film like this is for people to figure out what they're watching, so a warning would definitely be a move in the wrong direction.Basically Vivarium is a metaphor for life, or how humans deal with life. Most people, in the world, get married, have kids, and so forth, although there are some that don't follow the righteous path. It doesn't really matter that these 2 people are being studied by some alien being. What matters is putting a couple, any couple, into this trap, will result in the same end. We witness life before a child and life after a child. Having children after marriage changes EVERYTHING, and basically starts the second half of life. I think the best and most obvious metaphor was the hole Tom can't stop digging, just like the debt that accumulates after getting married and having kids. One big hole that just keeps getting deeper.Vivarium strips away all the layers and leaves the total monotony of what us humans experience. If you were waiting for the aliens to show up at the end you were in the wrong theater, or where ever you saw it. And if you were waiting for a happy ending you just might be on the wrong planet.",Vivarium

Very ""deep-thinking""/Syfy/future oriented-technology/a ""What If This Is How Future Life Would Be"" set up, esc. So the idea of the movie was good.

This could have easily been a short film. The only reason I can think of to have dragged this story out is so that the audience could experience the same slow agony that the main characters do. One doesn't so much watch this movie as they do suffer through it. If I could, through some time bending magic, go back and unwatch that movie, I would.Just so you have an idea of how my tastes run, I like horror, I like dark and I like bleak. I enjoy listening to dark horror wave synth (look it up), my favorite book is House of Leaves and I count movies such as Cube and Train to Busan as among my favorites. The bleakness of Vivarium doesn't bother me so much as its lack of any excitement or suspense. This movie doesn't have a story arc as much as a painfully slow decline to its unsurprising and inevitable ending, which, by the way, is the only thing that gave me any joy in the regrettable experience that was Vivarium.

This is not a Marvel or DC movie. I understand the ratings from that audience. Be prepared to watch a movie like 'Being John Malkovic' and not X-Men. Manage your expectation and you will have a nice movie evening before bedtime.That said, the message I got at the end of this movie is the deeper meaning of life or the absence of a deeper meaning of it. People are marrying, getting children, raising them and eventuelly die. While the circle of life repeats itself. That is basically the abstract of life as we know it. I don't share this point of view but the story told in the film was fun to watch.The story is told quickly and full of story twists which makes such a dark theme relatively light-hearted and fun to watch. I myself wouldn't put the film in the horror genre more in the mystery.If you like art-house movies then this is could be a classic in the making. I think it's a fairly low budgetted film which is made very keen and turned out to be worth watching.",Vivarium

559,smashingadams,A great concept with an amateur execution,3,8 September 2020,"When I watched the trailer for Vivarium I was immediately intrigued. The concept was definitely enticing, it seemed fresh and unique, and I do love Jesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots. The concept, admittedly, IS both enticing and unique- the issue lies not with the central plot or themes, but, unfortunately, with the execution of the story.Any good story is dependent on one thing: ""yes"". The characters must say ""yes"", literally or figuratively, to their surroundings. ""Yes"" to fighting their individual battle. ""Yes"" to acknowledging their circumstances. ""Yes"" to each other, whether or not that means supporting each other in their decisions or simply acknowledging that they are taking place. Vivarium is a story full of ""no"", and that is its ultimate downfall.""No"" is not a compelling story arc. ""No"" is boring. ""No"" not only stops plot development in its tracks, it stops the audience from caring a lick about the characters or what happens next. I can't imagine how much more interesting and compelling this moving would have been had either of the main characters decided to acquiesce to their surroundings, even falsely or superficially, to pay attention to the incredibly simple directions they were given of ""raise the child and be released"". It seems like a no brainer that they were being observed or tracked after a certain (very early) point, yet they seem to rage against that reality constantly. I can imagine resisting for the first bit of their time in this strange and isolated environment, but to constantly maintain their denial is not only totally unrealistic, it is objectively boring.Film writers who write characters which are made to seem smart, yet constantly make incredibly stupid decisions, alienate their audiences.Fantastical sci-fi narratives, especially when they feature human or humanoid characters, still need to be rooted in realistic human emotion. That's what makes a story about aliens or fairies or wizards relatable. It makes a totally unrealistic narrative something that people can place themselves in, which keeps us invested. This movie was centralized on two people who continuously made the most nonsensical, stupid decisions at every turn, which, in my personal case, made me feel completely alienated from them. I didn't care about their emotional arcs because they were so lazily touched upon. By the end, I really couldn't have cared less about what happened to them, because I was never given a reason to care.Vivarium was a wonderful concept executed lazily and haphazardly, a waste of two phenomenal actors, and a waste of my time. At least they got a good editor to make their trailer. Watch that instead, and then move on with your day.",Vivarium

581,nikki_lambert,Mixed feelings...,4,22 September 2021,"I expected to enjoy Vivarium which, from its previews, seemed to portray a surreal, existential nightmare. Unfortunately, the plot more resembled an unraveling fishing net, filled with holes and loose ends.The main theme was given away during the opening sequence, then again in the schoolyard. What remained unanswered were the reasons for and methods of the trap into which Tom and Gemma were led. While the cuckoo theme was patently obvious, the entire point of the trap seemed to be to generate yet another agent to lure yet another couple into the trap; the aliens seemed to have no other purpose, no lives of their own. Just reproduction.Motives remained baffling as well. Tom's obsession with digging an ever-deepening hole in the front yard. Gemma's disgust toward the child suddenly becoming protective and motherly. The fact that both Tom and Gemma gave up escaping rather quickly, settling into acceptance of their situation far sooner than was realistic.The montage at the end, while nightmarish, posed more questions than it answered. I was left feeling profoundly unsatisfied with Vivarium because it had so much potential that was never realized. As a metaphor for modern life, it was stunning. As a science fiction film, not so much.",Vivarium
582,martin-krh,Creepy dark suspense.,9,26 April 2021,"Seeing the mixed reviews I decided to add my 2 cents. I thought at first it would be a waste of time, but it is one of those films that linger in your mind and gives you lots to think about. The movie is in my opinion very underrated, it is not tedious and repetative, just slow. Also the visuals seems a bit cheap and cheesy at first sight, but that is part of the concept.There is a creepy undertone throughout most of the film (especially the real estate man is creepy as h...), nice visuals and very convincing acting throughout. The humor is there but very subtle, if you're a parent I think you will notice this.The plot unfolds slowly as the couple tries to cope with their desperate situation, I am not going to reveal much as part of the appeal is figuring out what exactly is going on. It will be revealed slowly as the movie progresses.If you thrive on action scenes, loads CGI effects or quick dialog this is not for you. If you enjoy movies such as those by David Lynch or similar just sit back and enjoy the experience, then I think you will be entertained. I wish there were more movies like this.I rated it 9/10.",Vivarium

584,lucy_brindley,Deeply disturbing for 30-somethings,8,27 May 2021,"Watching Vivarium was a deeply unsettling experience for me. The elements all came together to bring a terrible sense of being trapped in a never-ending cookie-cutter suburban nightmare, raising a child you're not ready for only to have it literally drain the life out of you and ending up in a sexless, spiteful relationship. It basically takes an optimist young couple and destroys them by dropping them into the American Dream - perfect home and yard, marriage, baby, the nuclear family. But what do you do then? They are completely isolated, the food is packaged and tasteless, and the child becomes more demanding and terrifying and they are unable to connect with or understand it. They glimpse the realities around them, with every other couple trapped in the same nightmare but no way to communicate it or break the cycle. Absolutely loved this film and it definitely left an impression on me. But then, maybe it's my age and lifestyle that makes me view it through this lens and project my opinions. Others may interpret it in a totally different way but there's so many great things going on it this film that it is definitely worth a watch.",Vivarium

This isn't a mainstream film, rather it resembles a play, which gives a nod to Samuel Beckett's ""Waiting for Godot"". With it's limited cast, static set design and dreamlike colours and soundtrack, I found myself mesmerised by every detail of this surreal little odyssey. It's necessary to absorb the atmosphere and dread of the existential nightmare that unfolds in order to enjoy the way it gets inside your head and alters your mood. Personally this is exactly the kind of movie which doesn't make me feel that I've wasted an evening. You can keep your guns and explosions, this is the closest I've felt to visiting a theatre since it's been impossible to do so.

The production feels and look crisp.The frame story is as follows. A young couple is looking for a home, a house, to spend their lives in. I'm not sure how, but they end up at a brokerage firm, run by this absolutely bizarre character. The guy is not creepy, sleazy or vile in any way. On the contrary, he is so over professional, he becomes a.caricature of every broker you've ever met. A genuin oddball.Together, they visit this seemingly new built neighborhood named Yonder. Row after row of houses, that looks exactly the same. Every. House. Is. Identical. Period. Every house look like they are on display rather than being for sale. Even the paintings in the houses depicts - the room the painting happen to exist in.The thing is, this could have been an excellent satire on the world we live in; a mass produces society, where everything looks the same but is empty on soul. I've heard others complain about the lack of ideas and substance, how this would have been better of as a short film. That's the main flaw of the film. In the end, it's an okay film.

The cast is small but talented, and their chemistry as a couple and increasingly distant lovers is displayed with poise, reserve, angst, and horror. Eisenberg and Poots carry the entire film through its run time beautifully, bringing characters to life as they very gradually fall into mania.The threat of the film is an unseen force, with subtle hints pointing towards an intergalactic threat that causes menace, confusion, and maddening fear all off screen. Their horrible trap is brought to life through synthetic clouds and identical nuclear age houses all within a warping maze that seems to haunt the characters the harder they try to escape.

Chilling atmosphere throughout the movie and really makes you think about the cyclical nature of existence that humanity brings upon itself and calls it living.Some reviews say that the beginning is boring and unnecessary, however this is because they can't comprehend that it actually sets up the psychological horror perfectly through a continuous metaphor. For example, cuckoo at the beginning in the nest, forcing another parent to raise its young, perfectly alluding to the rest of the movie.As well as the parasitic nature of the child/estate agent, but that if it had been parent living the same day in their boring, manufactured house with their own kid, it would be seen as normal.The child's species is like a termite, simply there to reproduce then die, which is what we are also designed to do, but that we trick ourselves into seeing ourselves as more important and that is what makes the concept of being nothing more than a termite scary to some people.",Vivarium

Cinematography and music / sound design has always been looked upon seriously by the director but the script was a bit vague, leaving holes and unexplored themes.The movie was slow and I generally like slow movies but the acting was not as profound and this could have made a big difference in such a small production (all scenes must have been shot indoors and in limited time - common guys, let some beard grow, play real, play dirty, people can take it now-As a said earlier the topic was not very original but the idea is genuinely interesting. I liked the intensity close to the end of the movie and the twist was ok and overall, the movie felt like something between a comedy and a thriller. Actually, everything that this movie attempted to communicate could have been best portrayed in a 25 minute Twilight Zone episode from the sixties, apart from the colors, visual effects and technical aspects of course, which are nice but did they help? No. The drama really turned into comedy and the suspense into horror. So overall, easyly digested. An ok film to pass the time.",Vivarium

There is no explanation as to why the neighbourhood is endless or where the boy came from. In my opinion, the setting of the endless neighborhood only expresses how the average, suburban family can't ""escape"" from their life. The tasteless food also represents how bland their life is. The guy digging a hole can represent the futility of working, or how by working so much he dig his own grave. I believe many metaphors can arise from this film, which is what makes it worth it: not the plot itself, but what it aims to express.
Like ""Mother!"", this film has a load of negative reviews for being metaphorical rather than having a clear plot.

A couple buys a house, they have an unexpected child, that child is a nightmare in their life but is their responsibility (in this case, by force,) the couple begin to fight because the child strains the relationship, the father works himself to death in search of some kind of meaning, the mother dies of heartbreak, and the child moves on to continue his own monotonous life cycle.I believe the movie was meant to be boring because it was supposed to reflect how boring ""your average citizen's"" life can be.I agree with other reviews saying there could have been a montage of the couple trying to escape. It would add a bit more substance to the actual plot and could have represented a ""midlife crisis"" to stay in line with the overall metaphor of the movie.I really enjoyed this flick, especially considering I've never seen anything quite like it.

Overall, I found it enjoyable, I liked the premise and the general mood of the film. It was slow in many places, I'd even venture to say it's a slow paced film in its entirety, but it only really feels slow in certain places. I'd like to imagine that's what the director was trying to convey; monotony, lethargy, emptiness, but it did drag on sometimes.
The ending was slightly anticlimactic in my opinion and in general i felt the story left much to be desired. But again I like the idea of it, it just felt very bare bones like it wasn't fully fleshed out yet. Perhaps it could be better as a book where one can spend more time on the details.
Would i recommend this? If you like movies with a hint of sci fi/psychological mind bending then maybe you'd find it pleasant enough. Not something I'll be revisiting though.",Vivarium

It could be interesting for a small group of movie lovers who don't mind thinking about painful darkness of the life on their weekend, but I do not recommend it to general public. It can be very annoying! Here are some positive points: 1) I liked the music and audio overall. The use of music during the movie and at the end was very good. 2) The act was also fantastic. there are very difficult scenes but they made them professionally. 3) The camera and edit were also great.

The story was compelling enough, but I have to say that the ending really bummed me out. Don't read more if you don't want spoilers!I suppose it's no one's fault but my own that I went into this hoping for a happy ending? I mean, they made it pretty clear that this situation is inescapable. It makes sense for the story, of course, that they weren't the only people drawn into this and they wouldn't be the last. It's implied that whatever it holding them captive is some kind of alien life form that relies on another species (humans) to raise its young. It's a good premise.Still, the ending has left me in a bit of a sour mood. I don't know, it might have been naïve of me to expect this mostly bleak movie to have a happy ending. But damn, they really hammer it in that there's no hope for these people.All in all though, it's alright. I had high hopes for this movie but I'm left feeling kind of indifferent.

If this had been cut in half then I am sure it would've been ten times better.What I liked was the production design, I would hate something like this in any other movie but it was fitting for the story and made sense. I also liked the performances, I think Jesse Eisenberg and Imogen Poots had an amazing chemistry and I loved their characters' relationship.If this had been given more thought, it could've been better, the whole cuckoo opening was just unnecessary and too telling, but it just comes across as a bit too amateurish and incoherent.

It was really disturbing. When I thought about it and looked up what the meaning of the movie was I was disturbed and didn't like it.
Also I don't like that the voice of the kid is a weird adult voice.
Idk what they're commenting on- the typical white heterosexual couple having a a baby in the suburbs and letting their relationship fall apart as they sorta parent a kid they didn't want? Maybe? I mean, everybody's not doomed to an unhappy marriage. You don't have to buy a house. Parenting a child doesn't suck the life out of you and most people don't consider killing their kid.
This movie was just sad and weird and I didn't like it. And the ending sucked. I mean what's the point. The aliens force the couple to raise one of their alien babies because they can't raise it themselves yet they can go to earth and build a weird neighborhood and give the couple food so they can raise it? And in the end it just replaces the other one that takes couples to the neighborhood? What's the point? There's no point.

From here on, I grabbed my popcorn and looked forward for a rollercoaster. Sadly that is not what I got. Instead I got a dull boring movie if nothing. Absolutely nothing. I still cannot wrap my head around, how an director can make such an empty movie like this. It is slow and boring as hell. The kid is annoying and WHATEVER WOOF WOOF. The movie isn't exploring anything(I now it is limited in the area). Many weird and surreal things happen, that are just to random or abstract for the general viewer. The ending is cynical and leaves me with a lot of unanswered questions. I don't know what the director went for with this movie. Maybe it is a matter of perspective. I think this movie is mostly based on philosophical topics such as existentialism, Kafka's ideas, and so on. There are many metaphors and symbolism, that can be interpreted in many ways. Minimalistic in it's dialogue, for you to analyse them carefully. Visually It is great. The acting as well. Special effects are amateurish.

694,graphicsgod,Movie makes Mormons evil... **Spoilers**,6,27 August 2020,"**This review will contain spoilers FYI!!**This movie was interesting and has a neat twist on the ""Stephen King"" like horror genre! But with a ""Edward Scissor hands"" like look. And basically, from what I understood, that Mormons are evil. ..Oh and they are aliens!Now take what I'm posting with a grain of salt, since I was doing computer work while watching this, so I might have missed something. But I got the gist of what happened!It starts off showing this baby bird killing other baby birds, so that it's the only bird in the nest, so that the mother has to feed it. And it continues to force the mother bird to feed it, even after it is old enough to get food on its own. Then the title appears. This was creepily done and sets the tone for the movie.Then a couple are walking around town and happen to walk into an office that sells people on buying a new home. He dresses and comes off as a Mormon. They feel this is weird, but he talks them into following him to check out one of the houses to see if they would be interested. They follow him in they're car for a ways before arriving at this subdivision of houses that are all green and look alike, with clouds that look like out of a painting.Then he shows them around, acting weird, then suddenly disappears! So they get weirded out and get in they're car and try to leave. At this point you kinda figure out something is very off. After driving in circles they keep arriving at the same house they left at. Eventually the car runs out of gas. They try they're cell phones, but no signal. So they decide to give up and go inside. The next day, they try walking in one direction, and end up back where they started.Next someone leaves a box of vacuum bagged food for them. The husband decides to burn down the house, hoping it would attract attention. It burns to the ground, yet no one arrives. After the smoke clears, the house magically reappears. At this point they don't know what to do. And at this point I was really invested in this crazy mystery!!Next another box shows up with a baby, with a note, ""Take care of the child, and you may leave."" Here's where the movie goes into Stephen King territory.At this point the movie asks the main characters to actually take care of the child, and he talks with a weird ""voice!"" Almost like an alien trying to mimic a humans voice. Side note, towards the end, they straight up tell you this child is an alien! They go back and forth treating it like it's they're child and hating it and wishing it would go away. Unfortunately the movie doesn't try to show the audience what would happen if the child were killed or ignored. And the child keeps watching a ""channel"" on tv that is similar to ""Hypto-toad"" from Futurama. Like the channel is feeding the child information or something. But they never show the other two trying other channels or even watching tv..Then the husband is smoking outside and flings his cigarette at the grass and it burns away in a manner, almost like watching ""stop-motion"" in action. So he gets the idea to start digging. And he keeps digging. And every day the child magically gets older at a faster rate.And then the husband mysteriously dies, although they show a scene where he starts to have leasions on his back. Is being there, the cause for them to slowly die from some kind of radiation? I dunno! Because she also mysteriously dies as well. But they clearly show at the end, that these ""Mormons"" like beings are aliens and they trick humans to go live at this house. And play mind experiments on them to be parents to these creatures, and eventually die to have the alien take them out like trash, and replace the Salesman at the office. Why?!?! What's the purpose (other than to have humans raise a alien child as a humanoid)?!? How has no one else found these houses?!? I dunno! The movie doesn't give more information than that! They just state it's an endless cycle, and that's it.I kinda liked it!! Minus the ""vague"" ending. My only odd gripe is Jesse Rosenberg, doesn't come off as someone who can play this character like how it should have been played. He is supposed to be a construction worker or electrician or something (since he has a ladder on his vehicle). But he just doesn't look like someone who would be in this profession. And Imogen Poots, did a great job, with what she had to work with.Anyway this movie isn't going to grip you or keep you on the edge of your seat, it's a slow burn. But I still really enjoyed it, an average thriller!",Vivarium

With that out of the way, the screenplay, however, was lacking. There were way too many plot holes.When they first tried to escape, they check their phones. Even without phone signal reception, GPS should work more often than not. Could've given us something about the nature of where the place is located.When Gemma is able to get the boy to pretend the person he met, she learns the boy's true physical nature. But then they drop this part of the plot and move straight to the future where he's a grown man. What happened next? Did she try to learn about the book more? Did she find anything? There was so much to explore there.Finally, they show how the boy/man moves: by lifting the sidewalk and going through. Here I thought they'd finally revel the nature of things, like what the creatures are, what kind of reality are they living in, and so on. But nothing of the sort. She falls through what seemed like space-time, watching the past tenants, and then back to the present, and boom, abrupt ending.Going through others reviews, one of the reviews talked of how humans feel empathetic to newborns and hence the hesitation to kill the creature as a young boy, and how the cycle kept repeating and that the ""aliens"" were just using the humans as caretakers until they found their next set of people to raise the next gen. While that's a good story, it doesn't justify stretching a story to 90 minutes.It's a one-time watch, nothing more than that. I really hoped there would be a lot more. But oh, well.",Vivarium

700,ashleyhaldane,Brilliantly Executed Thriller,8,6 July 2021,"Vivarium - at first glance - looks like an intriguing thriller film with an interestingly unique premise. On reading the summary, I at first wondered how such a basic idea could form the basis of an entire feature-length (1h 30min) film. However, the sense of horror and fear is derived much less from the actual plot (although the mystery surrounding this does contribute), and much more from the tension which is built up due to the excellent cinematography and acting.The film is unique in that it only uses a total of 4 (main) actors for most of the scenes - however, this does not stop the film from feeling big-budget and 'blockbuster' level, due to the amazingly convincing and genuinely terrifying acting on behalf of the main 4/5 characters.As the film progresses, it gets darker and darker - this culminates in a strange ending sequence which left me wondering what exactly I had just watched. However, this is one of the films which will stay with you long after you have watched it. It provides a unique commentary on human nature and psychology, civilised modern life, and being 'trapped' in a web of expectations and ideals.Tl;dr:An excellent film, with stunning visuals and brilliantly convincing spine-chilling acting from the main leads. Definately worth a watch for a thriller film which is unique and different, but one which you will also think about long afterwards.",Vivarium

Watching, because of the thought: ""this is sci-fi, some interesting plot, to make me think"". It was unpleasant, claustrophobic, the sets were as bland as they were meant to be, within a plot that went nowhere. It was depressing because there was nothing positive about it. It would have been saved by an interesting sci-fi concept, developed, other than a sci-fi plot that has been used many times before. I note the director has done only this, as a film. Otherwise, is an advertising producer, formulaic 'style'. This, as other reviewers have said may have been an attempt at getting 'black mirror' type cynicism. It was slightly intersting to see the characters psychological breakdown, within the impossible setting. They attempted to 'explore', to climb over multiple back fences, in this duplicate ""Barret"" (UK) type estate. They became run down, hopeless. Bleakness, cynicism without humour. It was unrelieving. No style. Everything in the sets, the plot, derivative. It is an 'ad'. It could be compared to say, 'Eraserhead', David Lynch did it better. No style.

722,Kaysomnia,"Interesting idea, not so great execution",4,26 September 2020,"If you're reading this, it's likely you already are aware of the plot, so I won't explain it for you.
The beginning of the movie pulls you in using odd behaviors from an introductory character and a very strange setting. The movie takes place mainly in Yonder, a ""neighborhood"" which, at first glance, seems to be a bizarre mix of something from Stepford Wives, Edward Scissorhands, and The Truman Show.
Once the couple nears the end of their house tour, the movie just gets more and more strange as the minutes pass.
The plot itself resembles the weirdest of fever dreams, with a lot of questions being raised and only a few of them being answered.
Poots and Eisenberg are absolutely the highlight of the movie, their sublime acting carrying my rating from a 2.5 to a solid 4. The cinematography is also note-worthy; as confusing as the movie is, it certainly is nice to look at.
While Vivarium isn't necessarily bad, it also isn't great. It's weird enough to keep you interested throughout, but fails to give the audience a satisfying ending.

But, then it takes a turn and seems to quickly rush through the to the end, leaving more questions than answer. But, it's not like the movie left you pondering the implications and outcomes. The questions were more along the lines of asking why they even did what they did. There was no resolution or reson given for what the main characters endured, and the end left you back at the beginning with zero clarity. People say, jokingly, that a movie could have ended after the opening credits, but in this case it's not in jest that you can make this claim.

727,reedisamonk,"An Interesting Allegory about the Horror of the Abstract, Impersonal Machinations of Civilization and its Reproduction",8,2 April 2020,"Stylistically and in terms of acting, I had some gripes with the movie. I thought Jesse Eisennburg just didn't fit the role...he's just too goofy to really convey ""terror"" as an actor IMO. Imogen did a lot better IMO. Also, aesthetically, some of the presentation was a little heavy-handed.That being said, overall, I really liked the movie. For me, it's an allegory about Society with a capital ""S"" in all it's abstractness and impersonalness. And the suburbs are the perfect representation of that.....the 'alien' force in the movie represents Society as an abstract, impersonal, top-down weight on the individual which doesn't really care about what makes the individual an individual, but rather only views the individual as a fungible entity that needs to ""fuel"" society and civilization's incessant reproduction, even when it doesn't actually serve the individual human beings it uses as fodder. The ""alien"" or ""monster"" in the movie just wants any warm body to ""play the part"" by following the ""typical"" path, i.e. move to the suburbs, raise a child, and then die and be discarded. The elite at the top of society that control housing, food, healthcare etc. just want to keep the illusion of life perpetuated, even when upon a closer inspection, it really has a deep disdain for real human beings and just sees them as a means to an end, not an end in themselves.That's also what the son/child represents. Its existence and presence is ""forced"" onto the couple, and the child's alienation from the parents represents the alienation inherent in the social life and the generational gap within the inorganic communities of the suburb/shopping mall/corporate office cycle of life etc.To summarize: the movie starts with a hopeful, romantic young couple looking to purchase their own home....but when they enter the suburb real estate office, the company representatives just see ""prey,"" not real human beings, and the couple is immediately thrust into the terror of being just a cog in the machine.",Vivarium

742,onenonymouse,Nonsense. Creative nonsense,3,14 October 2021,"I'm actually surprised by how many mid-to-high ratings this has.This was an interest concept in the beginning. It had a lot of potential to be social commentary and to have some deeper meaning. But instead it's just plain bizarre nightmare without any purpose. (Reviewers saying this does have some sort of deeper message or social commentary really confuse me. I love social commentary whether it's subtle or hits me over the head. But this movie doesn't have it.)Starting at the point where the couple receive a baby and are told they will be released if they raise it, the film could have gone in a different direction. It could have been an exploration of raising children, even if it was a sped-up version of child rearing, and its impact on couples. Maybe the tedium and boredom that can come with parenting. There could have been something really important they had to realize about raising children before they got released, an actual potential positive message. And of course there's the obvious potential for commentary about cookie cutter suburbia, which this obviously is alluding to but doesn't really address head on.Instead, the film just takes a bizarre direction of randomness. The kid is not a normal child in any way, and so there's no true commentary on parenting. The screaming is really annoying. The voice of the child is bizarre and creepy. From a purely horror/creepy movie perspective, though, it's not scary enough. The fact that there are basically 4 actors (ignoring the very brief schoolchildren in the beginning) is interesting but gets old. The relationship between the couple isn't really explored enough; she should get angrier and more frustrated with him, and vice versa; there should be more conflict and resolution. There is a bit of conflict that just sort of resolves somehow. We never truly get to know any of the characters. The ending just happens.I give it 3 for creativity (otherwise it would get 0 if that was possible), but I didn't enjoy watching it and wouldn't recommend it to anybody.",Vivarium

744,khaz411,Entertaining but average.,6,29 March 2020,"Heavy Spoilers ahead.I thoroughly enjoyed this movie but it could have been so much more. The first act takes its time with world building and character development. And then it falls flat becoming another run of the mill sci-fi movie. The main characters are basically stuck in in a cookie cutter world by aliens to trap them into raising alien children and to help them adapt for passable humans.This could have been a much deeper study in how we raise our children and prejudice indoctrination and the likes but it becomes an all too familiar story about how much modern society is not prepared for child care and home ownership. Even then, the message could have been better delivered if they had been given any choice in the matter but no, they are given a house and forced to live in it. They are given a child forced to raise it. If you're looking for clever development you saw in the first act then you can forget about it.
Like what happened here? With all the care the film makers took into developing the relationship between Gemma and Tom, it falls apart at the first sign of trouble. These two have amazing chemistry from the onset but disappeared into half assed narratives that are isolated from each other without so much as giving a proper send off.Incase you are still confused by what's going on at the end: aliens trapped a loving couple into a pseudo world in order to help them adapt into our world. They don't have the resources to do so given their rapid growth. When the child is mature they destroy the surrogate parents and find new ones. Rinse and repeat. There is no deeper meaning.

748,utopiafilm,Burning questions to read after watching,6,4 March 2021,"Thank God you can jump some seconds from time to time! The movie is watchable with this feature. Without, the lack of rhythm could make you quit to see the entire film after a so good trailer, so good cast and so good premise.The first burning question is this: if they experienced the double crime committed by the infamous bird - she even try to explain to a child the cuckoo life cycle - why the hell they do not realize the situation they are in and fight back? Okay, Mr. Film director: you injected my eye with an animal snuff scene, you show me how an infant cuckoo in murdering his host, then why the hell you frustrate me from my earned revenge? Why you do not give me the chance to see that perfect couple - yes, they are superbly bonded - fighting back and build a strategy? Her lonely fight is good, but this could be good for a final assault, after he had fallen heroically.The second burning question is where is the alien female? Why we see only the life cycle of a male? This is frustrating. If we could see the rest of the alien life, maybe the storyline could gain consistency.The third burning question is why bother so much? Why aliens are struggling so much to blend in when they could go to a less developed society to parasite them easier? If they could offer so much as home, space, booze and virtual reality why they do not negotiate babysitting for material presents? Three quarts of the actual population of our planet will gladly trade babysitting for some boxes full of FMCG.The premise is fine, the acting is great, why do not build a good story on those? All you have to do is to develop the alien logic of being. Why Poots and Eisenberg do not talk and analyze everything on and on, to the point to test everything, to scratch all the materials, to smash a neighbor's window, to make a short circuit, to pour on purpose water on the telly and so on and so on, like real prisoners do in a real jail.Why forcing me to give just a 6 to this film when it was so easy to award it with a 9?",Vivarium

And if the sight of ""perfect"" little clouds in a ""perfect"" sunny sky, day after day after day doesn't creep you out so much that you are still thinking about this frightening subdivision days and weeks after you see this film, then you might as well go and watch another formulaic and utterly forgettable slasher movie.You have to be able to put yourself in the place of the couple to see and feel all that is happening in this hell of a place as if it were happening to you.

Cannot imagine what was otherwise expected or not expected on to which the movie doesn't deliver. It was well executed with a kinda Twilight zone or tales from the darkside atmosphere. .. with only the 3 main characters and a whole lot of houses that look exactly the same. .. I thought it was a great flick with good acting, likeable characters (except for the mutant man child) lol. Even the look of this film had a crazy nostalgia, a sorta mystique that keeps you invested in its journey. ..ima hava say, think it was A very good and genuinely different blend of dark comedy, horror, and maybe some disturbing Sifi wit a

I figure that pack would have lasted 3 days at most...and he had them for well over 100 days. They don't ever say how much time has passed by with the exception of when they measure the freak of nature baby thing. I mean come on, how lazy of a writer can you be? At least say it's because of aliens or something. But to leave us with absolutely nothing and no explanation for anything is just plan laziness.",Vivarium

Similarly what happens in this movie seems to be pointless in the end, humans serving as hosts to foster alien children, but in their imprisonment they find out what really made life worth living, they miss the wind, the smells, they miss home, the things that we may take for granted that make up the very essence of life. This movie's ending was very much an artistic choice. Just try and put yourself in their shoes and then stepping out of the house as if you were free after escaping this alien suburbian neighborhood. Imogen Poots and Jesse Eisenberg are great in their roles and the surreal atmosphere of the movie is well acomplished and consistent to the very end, definitely a movie worth watching.",Vivarium

Yet the reviews for this film are hateful and short-sighted, and completely untruthful.This is, and always will be, an excellent horror movie. I would challenge any viewer to work with the details and revelations given piecemeal throughout the narrative to create anything more captivating or satisfying. The film rarely bores from start to finish and every insight into the mystery before them feels as though it raises another question in its wake.The majesty of this film is in its callous disregard to the viewer. It doesn't have to tell us what's going on because we're on a need-to-know basis. This does leave several unanswered tidbits floating around in your brain while the credits roll but they're the kind of blanks better filled by the imagination.Personally, I don't understand the hate over this movie.

We're left with a explantion-less, tedious, thoughtless film that focuses on suburban child-rearing of an artificial human being that goes nowhere, suggests nothing, and frustrates from start to finish from the raising of basic questions that could make the characters' dilemma interesting.How do the couple survive in the neighborhood?
How does this Children acquire any kind of knowledge?
How do you reflect and really act when you're a prisoner in a paradise?Instead we're left with ponderous and self-indulgent shots and staging that go nowhere.

There were a few interestingly shot moments and even fewer moments where something truly interesting and engaging was taking place on screen to the point where we were somehow begging to see what was going to happen next just so that the scene we were watching would just end already. The social commentary aspect is so annoyingly blatant that it feels like a 15 year olds creative writing essay. I'm not against the use of metaphors in film by any means, but when the substance and story of your film feel like a waste of energy to watch no amount of cool and quirky visuals can save it. Certain visuals and ideas were so interesting that we asked after them as the film continued, yet they were either never expanded on or show again.

891,jcc-26001,Quite a movie .. a little scary with hilarity .. Easy to Decipher ..,8,11 July 2020,"Mixed reviews here .. love it or hate it .. I loved it .. The last 20 minutes or so explain it very easily ..Vivarium features two worlds .. The first being ours .. We only get a glimpse of it at the beginning and end of the film where at first we meet Gemma and Tom, a thirtyish couple who seem to love each other very much .. our heroes for 90 minutes and very well portrayed by these two talented actors .. but very soon, a second little secret and bizarre world is introduced to us by Martin, who works at the realty company. This is where the entertainment starts - He shows them unit #9, a furnished condo style unit that is identical and attached to hundreds and hundreds of others, forming a little green community .. After some inspection of the condo, Tom and Gemma find that Martin has left in his car and disappeared .. Martin has planted them here for one simple reason: The SURVIVAL of his secret world .. He is the entrance to this world and like our own world, he has a life span .. He will have to be replaced either before or (spoiler) during his death ..The couple quickly learn that they cannot get out of their community and always end up back ""home"" at unit 9 .. someone secretly delivers food and picks up their garbage by the sidewalk .. Very quickly afterwards, they discover a box with a baby boy in it and the words ""Raise The Boy and You Will be released."" printed on it .. We quickly figure that if they raise the child, they will find their way back to their real world .. WRONG ..We've all watched the movie here .. the boy grows incredibly quickly into a man .. he's definitely strange .. he repeatedly calls Gemma ""Mother"", something she dislikes but she eventually shows him some love while lying with him one night when he goes to bed .. all part of the plan of life .. just like the real world .. this is just one of the metaphors used in unit 9 ..Tom becomes obsessed with digging a hole in the front lawn and almost lives in it until he discovers a body .. someone has been here before him and Genna .. there are many similarities between this secret community which is implanted in the real world .. survival, birth, life, love and most importantly, children who carry life on to another generation ..The strange boy becomes a man ready for just about any task and after Tom dies without any look of aging, so does Gemma .. the boy/man has supplied them both with body bags and thrown them into the pit that Tom dug in the last half of the movie .. he then fills and flattens the large hole and suddenly grass covers the scar on the front lawn .. He and Martin are both a part of the cycle here .. the cycle that keeps this creepy little life force alive .. Somehow the boy/man knows Martin is dying and pours some gas from a hidden gas can into Tom and Gemma's car and drives out of the community straight to the realty office where Martin is close to death in his chair .. The boy/man promptly takes Martin's name tag off and pins it to his own shirt pocket, slides him into a body bag, stuffs him into a large file drawer and sits in his new office, smiling. He's ready to start his new career; Making certain that he can create one more cycle of life in his insane world .. and he sees success as a young couple walks into his office and starts looking at the pictures of the little green condo community ..I absolutely loved this movie ... Martin is the gateway to this insane little alternative reality and he ages extremely fast (Reason why Tom and Genna both die in less than a couple of years without aging if you watch the growth chart of the boy/man on the white pillar in unit 9) .. Martin's sole purpose on earth is to replace himself with a new man that is raised as a baby (Don't ask where the baby comes from as this is Sci Fi ..) by a normal couple that he lures and locks into unit #9 and when the baby is able and ready to replace him, he does so, and repeats another cycle like the dead Martin did by simple repetition ...How a lot of what happens in this alternative space is clearly left up to the viewer .. Best left alone as it is the real entertainment .. And I thought it was GREAT .. but the cycle of survival to unit #9 is SO OBVIOUS .. It makes me wonder if many of you aren't paying attention, especially to the ending ... Great movie eh?I think the real theme of Vivarium is ""Life is a b**** and then you die ...""",Vivarium

896,soulbaby03,I liked it!,8,23 July 2020,"I was expecting something a little different from the movie description of a couple stuck in a labyrinth of identical homes, but I was pleasantly surprised. This isn't a slow burn but does require, and really commands, your attention. I don't even like Jesse Eisenberg as an actor and yet I was able to overlook that and enjoy it as Imogen Poots is the real star and did a great job conveying her emotions throughout. I thought the production value was great, and don't really understand others' comments about it being low-budget at all.I appreciated the opening sequence and thought it added a nice flavor of foreshadowing without ruining anything. Obviously some people need to be spoon-fed an idea in order to even get a movie like this at all. Despite the strong start and eerie setup to their predicament, they allllmost lost me at 28 minutes in when stuff starts to get really weird, but if you can handle the pitch out in to left field it does get better. Just don't be on the lookout for a happy ending. Definitely not a ""waste of time"" as some classify it. I would watch again honestly.
**Spoilers ahead**Some have mentioned this movie should have been a short or a TV episode, however I thought it fit well into the 1 hr and 38 min runtime, and actually would have enjoyed a little deeper dive into what the couple felt and how they dealt with the initial arrival of their second ""package"", as well as Tom's reaction to Gemma's discovery about the book and the boy's non-human qualities.The ending could have been a little stronger, but I did feel it wrapped up the story and didn't leave too much unanswered. It doesn't make sense, however, that there is one host life cycle just repeating itself, especially with the theory that this is the beginning of some alien takeover, even if there are multiple experiments or whatever going on at the same time. Why replace when you could replicate and populate? I would have liked to have seen how the man escaped the neighborhood in the car, maybe having the road in front of him lift up like the curb did, and an alternate ending idea could have been Gemma waking up to another baby being delivered to the house, maybe this time making it a girl? Just my 2 cents.",Vivarium

Between the 30 second bursts of screaming accompanied by the ""American Dream"" symbols, fear, isolation, psychosis, and ultimately death; like I had just been psychologically tormented all the while holding out hope that there would be a resolution.This film was made with no intent of resolution.

909,cornwels-45510,reading the negative reviews reveals the film's true theme,9,25 August 2020,"It seems many viewers were so distracted by the style of the film that they missed its substance. To me, the film is not a critique of suburbia or parenting but a horror film about the positive qualities of both. Spoilers are full steam ahead below...Humans are excellent parents. We parent our helpless infants for a shocking long time, we build safe houses for them - rain, lightning & earthquake-proof. We raise them in patterns; sweet quiet streets & cookie-cutter homes, cookie-cutter gender roles as parents. With such bountiful generosity & devotion, with such easily grasped roles, how could a brood parasite not take advantage?The aliens in this film are our cuckoos. They give us their child and we raise it in our own nest. We are trapped by our own humanity. When we see the newborn we feel parenthood instinctively. We cannot crush the newborn's head with a pickaxe, though we know it is not human. We feed & nurture the child - perhaps begrudgingly, abusively, neglectfully - but we feed and nurture it even as it grows larger than ourselves. It takes all our energy to care for it, draining our very lifeforce, but we keep doing it. We can find no other option... We are trapped by our own nature.Other critics seem to think the aliens lack motivation, or that they have totally alien motivation; researcher motivation. I don't think so. Like the cuckoo, they are only fulfilling their own nature. They cannot save their para-parents. They are doing this to survive - it is their role in the circle of life. Why? Perhaps because their life span is so short, perhaps because their extra-dimensional nature makes typical parenting impossible, perhaps just the quirks of evolution. They look at us as we would see a cow. And they know how valuable our milk is. They must drink it to survive, so the baby calf is turned to veal and we eat ice cream on hot days. But are they evil? Not unless your tapeworm is evil. Nature is amoral.It is our own morality - the love for a baby's face - that traps us. We cannot dig out of our morality, or outrun it, or outthink it. This movie is exceptional because it shows us how our freely given empathy could be used to entrap and enslave us. I guess the only escape from this trap is infanticide or suicide - making the brood parasite strategy untenable, but ending our own life in the process. A more cruel trap than Jigsaw ever made. Horror at its finest.",Vivarium

914,rolarocks,Futility of Existence Analogy,6,8 September 2020,"Jesse Eisenberg films tend to have a certain standard. With a description reminiscent of original Twilight Zone ""Stopover in a Quiet Town"" and on a very hot covid day, I decided to give it a go. Personally, I find plastic midcentury-modern dystopias intriguing.

The last 15 min of the movie is really where all the ""excitement"" is. This had potential to be a really good thriller, but fell way short. Just no depth to it whatsoever.

927,harrisonbhelm,"A beautifully surreal, dread-inducing meditation on suburban family life",8,23 November 2020,"Yes, this film is slow. But its slowness is intentional and effective, so long as the audience recognizes that the film is not a bloody horror with jump scares, or a thriller that will keep your heart beating, or a dark comedy that will tinge your sadness with laughter. It is a film driven by the gut-churning performance of Eisenberg and Poots, whose fracturing relationship anchors the emotional turmoil central to this film. We are misled to hope that the relationship will flourish, even in that lonely dismal house and forced to raise a seemingly unlovable child. But the true horror of this film is that, for all their trying, the partners cannot learn to love themselves or each other again. It seems many viewers have missed this point. The audience is given plenty of time to meditate on all the tragically subtle, surreal moments in this film, and to feel the dread that slowly creeps into the protagonists futile lives, destroying them.
The film is a warning. We, of course, will die as well, and many of us live similar lives, much of which we were pressured to live or didn't choose at all. We are encouraged, even in the face of a slow, creeping kind of terror, to remember that what we love most might still be with us, and even if it isn't, we should try our hardest not to become lost to ourselves. To that end, this film is a masterpiece.",Vivarium

That being said, I was anticipating something mysterious and entertaining but this wasn't it.My main problems with the movie is how it fails to explore key elements or outright doesn't incorporate them later. The sound that Tom hears in the hole he dug and on the Television could of had some meaning but it doesn't. The book that Gemma receives with crypt texts of alien language went nowhere. Furthermore, by the end of the movie you discover that when Tom finds the body at the bottom of the pit it becomes a predictable ending. Both the main characters die, the humanoid alien drives off to the estate agents and the cycle repeats itself.By the end of the movie you're wondering whether you should be curious or not care at all.",Vivarium

936,jakob-70802,A story about how we cope with our fate,10,24 January 2021,"This is the first time I write a review here in IMDB. I'm surprised at the many negative reviews. If you haven't see it yet, do not read past this first paragraph if you want to avoid spoilers. Vivarium is scary, but not your average horror movie with monsters from dark worlds. It's not build on the hollywood movie template. It's not about bad guys and your standard hero how always win the fight going out in a blaze of violence. It's about how we cope in a strange world with logic, fear, love. It's about choices. It's about us, the audience. Now go see it.Now for the part of this review with spoilers.Contrary to many reviews, I think this story is pretty straight forward. Perhaps me having raised two kids helps me put this in a context where it makes sense. Yes our couple is obviously luret into a fake world where they are basically locked up and unable to escape from. The boy is not their's, and it quickly turns he out is not human as you and I are. But this is where the plot of this brilliant story unfolds. For what do you do, when you are put in a strange and scary situation? Do you cope with it with fear, mistrust and hostility? Do you cope with it with logic, open mindedness, compassion? Outside the initial abduction, the abductors do not act with hostility. They provide a nice little home in a nice but obvoiusly fake suburbian area. They leave champagne and strawberries as a welcome package. They provide them with food and other necessities. When Tom burns down the house, they rebuild it. The abductors leave a message with the boy: ""Raise the boy and you will be released"". Tom and Gemma approach their fate completely differently. Tom is being hostile to the boy from the start and focused on breaking out. Gemma is more open. Finds compassion for the boy. Is more acceptive of the situation. Although the boy is creepy, he is not hostile. His mirroring of his ""Parents"" and his curiousness, although creepy and misplaced, is a completely normal metaphor for how our children act. When he is shown compassion, he responds with compassion. Gemma and Tom's misfortune is of their own doing. Our should I say of Tom's doing. His insistance that the boy is in ""It"" and not a ""Him"" builds a wall between the couple and the boy. They don't even give him a name. Tom's hostility influcences Gemma in a very negative way, blocking her from building a compassionate relationship with the boy. Gemma's reaction, when the boy shows us a hint of his non-human nature is fear and hostility. I bet this is also how we, the audience, reacts. And this is also where this movie is brilliant. Why do we, the viewers, even call it a horror movie? Why are we scared, upset? Yes, we meet something that is different. But it's basically not hostile or dangerous. Just different.Tom digs a hole to get out and that is his fate. The deeper the hole, the most sick he becomes, eventually dying. He died because he crossed the boundaries. Gemma's eventually suffers the same fate. When she follows the boy into other parts of the fake world, where we see example of other ways we humans could react in the situation, she exits her safe environment and catches a lethal dose of something.And that is what this movie is all about, Choices. What would have happened, if Tom and Gemma had acted with openness, curiosity, trust and compassion instead of fear from the beginning? How would their relationsship, and their relationsship with the boy and the abductors have involved? Would they have been released? Would they have lived on? Would they have made a family?So no, this is not the usual hollywood template movie. There are no heroes. Our main characters make the wrong choices and suffer from it. What would we have done? What do we do, when we face the unknown?",Vivarium

I continued to wait for ""something"" to happen but it was very repetitive. I didn't feel engaged in the characters and when ""certain"" things happened to the main protagonists, I had the attitude ""oh well"".I'm a huge fan of sci-fi and thriller and this left me regretting that this was an hour and a half of my life I wasn't getting back.I would have rated it lower than 4 stars, but I gave it a few stars, as I thought the premise of the movie was interesting, but they could have done so much more with this movie.",Vivarium

961,flycowboi,Good Idea Underdeveloped,4,2 December 2020,"This movie showed up in a couple of horror blogs I follow. I had never heard of the movie but it was new and looked different and creative. First of all I need to say this was a sci-fi thriller missing any real horror elements. There were many missed opportunities for a darker turn into the horror realm but I feel the producers were going for a different vibe. It was not scary however it was weird and interesting. I'd say for the most part the movie had a great concept but ultimately was produced before it had time to properly simmer in the brainstorm of the writers and become balanced. I liked the eerie style and loved the use of color. It reminded me of the classic days of Tim Burton films before Disney ruined him and let CGI rule his movies. Overall the movie has a lot of build up but the climax comes crashing down to an abrupt stop just as things are starting to be revealed. The film's arc was bent in a way that there was so much slow build up then suddenly too many things happening at once. Before we could indulge in all the crazy new twists the characters give up and we are left with so many questions.Vivarium was a captivating title and it perfectly describes the couples experience. I had never heard of the word so I had to look it up. If it weren't for the opening bird sequence the movie would have left even more loose ends. Some people like movies with a bit more mystery (Donnie Darko Theatrical vs Director Cut). I want an explanation of the why, when, and how because so many of those details are completely left out like the director expects us to not ask these important questions. I read one review that gave this a 9/10 and they were clearly full of their own BS. This was not a deep thought-provoking art film about the fear of starting a family and falling into societies standards; but it tried. If you want a dark artsy film watch Under The Skin.

You work until you die, the wife usually has to bury the husband. You have a kid that screams at you until you feed it and watches shows on television that sometimes seem like they might drive you mad. All the while living day to day life trying to keep within reality, and then you even see a peek that the only escape is suicide.You raise your child to do the same thing that you are doing in the end, like life is just a record playing on repeat.Like I said this movie could be a major trigger for the depressing tones that it plays. But if you have the deep opinion that there is more to life and death than what this picture of suburbia shows then you will also see the clever horror and well played creepiness of the film.",Vivarium

Where's the story?Even the""Sci"" is missing. The couples are the cuckoo caregivers, why kill them? Cuckoo's don't care, they want a free meal. They don't kill the caregivers, they just don't lose anything if they work themselves to death feeding the chick. Clearly this isn't that. Otherwise reuse the survivors.They're studying us. Hmm, pretty clear they are failing at keeping humans alive. Unless all the varied colors in the other houses were an experiment and not a reflection of emotions felt by the characters. Still, it's obvious we are a social species. How about filling in the zoo?They want to sneak into our society by planting their own among us. They don't even learn to imitate us. Good luck with that.And what? One creature grows old while one grows to maturity? I don't see them taking over at that rate.No, this was just a movie for the sake of making a movie. There isn't a good story at its core. This is a movie to showcase to your professor that you can make a scene driving to a mysterious location. You can make a scene with a woman that reached her breaking point, etc..

1018,MovieReviewer987653,This movie lacks any kind of profound twist or solution to the mystery.,3,3 October 2021,"Keep in mind, these are my opinions only, yours may differ. This movie is pretty much pointless. I'm saying this as someone who's a personality type that's very logic driven. The setup is great, but there's just way to much logical fails, + an ending that's pointless. This movie lacks any kind of profound twist or solution to the mystery.Spoilers ahead:What if I told you:
They never go into another house.Sometimes things reset, such as a whole house being burned down and then magically restored the next day.Sometimes things don't reset, such as a hole in the ground being dug day after day.The characters never attempt to truly solve it, such as drawing markings on walls or the road to figure out how big the place is.They decide to keep driving all night until the gas runs out instead of stopping and trying to figure it out.All in all there's enough fallacies and inconsistencies in there to clearly signal that this is not built on a solid foundation of clear rules but rather written in a ""being made up as you go"" kind of way.Things that further made me dislike the movie:
Near total lack of optimism or hope, virtually zero progress is being made to uncover the mystery as the movie goes on, rather it just drags on of them being in a nightmare for pretty much the entirety of the movie.To make things worse, they die in the end and no solution in sight.I saw some YouTube videos about what the director was trying to convey about an alien species forcing humans to raise their kids and also the part about how lack of ""natural elements"" was bad for humans. I think most of these were lost due to just general disappointment of the above mentioned fallacies.The good things:
I think everyone involved with production and acting did a good job, I think they probably delivered exactly what was asked for overall.I applaud the effort put into the movie.Some suggestions:
Make sure to play out all the possible attempts at solving the mystery before just giving up, let the characters play out the things that people in the audience are thinking such as example: ""why don't they go and check all the surrounding houses"".I think the ideas that was attempted could have done much better if you'd let the characters solve it and escape instead.",Vivarium

The movie has no ending and makes no sense nothing is explained are all negative reviews. So I'm gonna start with saying spoilers are coming so if you haven't watched it watch it because it's actually an excellent movie. I'm guessing most people don't know what vivarium means or is because the ones who are saying they have no idea what happened which is most of the reviews probably should look up the word. Also to the people that has said it made zero sense the entire movie is explained at the very beginning of the movie with the cuckoo bird and the switching out of the eggs. The entire movie is based on what if this happened to humans with the cuckoo bird egg switch. Yes they don't say if it was aliens or no but some other species not human are putting humans in an experimental vivarium and dropping one of their species mimicking a human baby for actual humans to raise and just like the story of the cuckoo bird and how it infiltrates other birds nests and we know what happens to the momma bird at the end of the cycle so everyone should knows what happens to our main characters at the end of the movie as well.

Vivarium has a big difference though: it lacks enough information to be considered as a concluded story, and it gives away too much info to be eligible for being called an open-ended movie.
If we place movies like Coherence, The Descent and Cube at the better end of ""Mazey Universe"" spectrum, then, as we pass Cabin in the Woods and 1408, we are moving towards the gray area. Until we get to films like The Signal and In the Tall Grass which belong to the lower range. And that's where Vivarium belongs to. In this movie humans are facing cuckoo-like beings that abduct human couples (instead of placing their children in their nest) and take them to the nest of their own. Apparently, these strange entities do not leave their offspring to fend for themselves and they provide them with enough education through a weird TV channel and a book with another-worldly alphabets. Now the question is that if these creatures are intelligent enough to create such a nest, why do they need humans to raise their children?

Whether we need to find truths (eg. Tom's digging, or Gemma's need to solve the mystery of the boy).2. We work until we die:
We work to survive and we survive to work, and inevitably dig our own graves.3. Rewarding misbehaviours:
Tom's tea kettle screams were ceased/rewarded whenever he got what he want. Gemma continued to tend to his every shrieks, therefore condoning this behaviour where the boy would do it over and over (I'm pretty sure my ears bled a little). Eg. Gemma continues to give the boy the right amount of milk in his cereal until his screaming stops.I'm sure there are more humankind criticisms I may have missed, but these ones stood out the most to me.I agree with other critics that this movie could have been shorter as there were a lot of scenes that were drawn out for intense stares, but also time was spent on beautiful scenes too.",Vivarium

I'm not sure if that was the whole point- that in life we just don't get an explanation, and that it was just 97 minutes trying to convey some deep meaning about life and suburbia and if it was then I guess they did that.Even though I feel overall pretty annoyed and can understand why some people hated this movie, it did really grip me in in the beginning in a way that a movie hasn't for a while, and the concept was very unique and that in itself nowadays is impressive.
So overall 6/10

1045,pritchardgordon,This is what sci-fi is all about,9,18 May 2020,"I agree that this movie isn't for everyone - that doesn't mean it's no good. Maybe it's just what I saw in the film when I watched it that made it so impactful. The movie is not called ""Suburbia"" - it's ""Vivarium"". That should have given you a clue. To me it's a movie about, for example, what fish in an aquarium or lions in a modern zoo must feel/think while researchers explore and try to understand their behaviour. Extending that further...it might also be what an invading force might do in order to prepare for battle I.e. study the enemy.

1071,aoifewan,An existential nightmare that unfolds like a stage play. Jesse and Imogen portray it perfectly,8,10 April 2020,"So I just finished watching this. Here are my fresh thoughts.
This is existential nightmare that unfolds like a stage play.
At first I think this is some extensive and ridiculous metaphor for life and the mundane reality of convention and bourgeois.
Next I start to resonate with it in the context of a very realistic portrayal of depression. When Gemma gets up in the morning and barely squirts the toothpaste onto her toothbrush I felt the hopelessness and saw myself in that moment. How many times I (and others) have played out countless similar scenarios in daily life?
Then I find out it's sci-fi and these two characters are actually lab rats. It probably is still a metaphor. But they are both amazing in this movie. I've admired them immensely as actors for years.
Tom's digging of his (and her) own grave is a poignant moment only realised when they are being dragged to it in the final scenes. Only then does the frightening reality of the whole setup begin to unfold before Gemma and the viewer. And the reality is...terrifying beyond imagination. At least to me.
I wonder if this is the kind of existential nightmare that lab rats are faced with each day of their life...at least on the same level as their level of consciousness allows them to experience.
Makes me wonder if our universe is a vivarium of sorts under eternal observation, only broken up by the existential crises we all seem to face day in day out.
I suppose there must be an economic/political message in there somewhere but that is beyond my own interpretation for now. But yeah that's my take on the movie.",Vivarium

1074,stefanTakeda,Get ready they are coming,7,13 February 2021,"If you don't understand something that doesn't need to mean it's bad. A lot of movie viewers these days enjoy shallow movies, where they don't need to use their brains. They want everything to be served, this movie doesn't work like that. In beginning, we see a cuckoo taking nest and Lorcan Finnegan wants to tell us something with this opening movie scene.
Gemma and Tom were brought to the new house by a creepy estate seller, later on, they get a child in a box where it says raise the child and be released. They don't know both the estate seller and child are some kind of creatures but not humans. These creatures, aliens keep humans trap in some kind of vivarium (closed area for keeping animals and plants for observation or research). Aliens are studying humans like lab rats and want to learn more about them so they can fit into the world unnoticed and slowly but surely take control of planet Earth. Gemma and Tom wasn't the only couple in the vivarium, we can see other families also there thanks to Gemma. Gemma was able to enter other dimensions and see other families there has the same struggle as they, but because aliens can manipulate time and dimensions she was ejected back to where she belonged. Also, Lorcan Finnegan reveals to us something important that I think a lot of viewers ignored. Food in a vivarium has no taste because the aliens don't know how real human food tastes like.
So let's back to the beginning with a nest and a cuckoo. The nest is a symbol for Planet Earth and the cuckoo is a symbol for an alien that is about to take the nest and we can't do anything about it.
They are here and they are observing us, it's only a matter of time when they gonna take full control of this nest aka Planet Earth.",Vivarium

1083,rachelcormier,Shockingly....I enjoyed this,10,29 July 2020,"Horror is my genre of choice and I am admittedly not much of a Sci Fi fan. This film, however, while straddling those two genres and including some black comedy, was actually quite enjoyable. Kafkaesque, certainly, as mentioned in other reviews, and a serious statement about suburban life and its repetitive cycle.The film centers around a young couple looking for a ""home"" who get railroaded into a showing in a cookie-cutter new development of identical houses. The agent (immediately bizarre AF. I would have noped right the F out of there as soon as he spoke) abandons them in this perfectly staged house, leaving them to see themselves out. Only they can't. There is no out. And regardless of how many times they round the block, attempt escape on foot, or set the place on fire, number 9 still stands. Provisions are delivered by someone unseen, and a second box containing a baby is left on the walk as well....with instructions to raise the child and be released.What happens next, and what is the bulk of the film, is watching this couple in the endless cycle of day-to-day life that only really differs from reality in the way that they are being forced to live this scenario. You watch as Gemma (Imogen Poots) succumbs to the exhaustion of ""motherhood"" as she attempts to placate the ""child"" and attends to its demands for care. You see Tom (Jesse Eisenberg) attempt to escape his reality by throwing himself into a project that is an exercise in futility, and literally digging himself Into an early grave. You see the frustration in both actors, and you watch their relationship move through the natural course of relationships in this very unnatural scenario; loving each other fiercely, resentment, fury, loving fiercely again.The climax is likely the most telling and relatable moment, as Gemma is somehow traveling through other dimensions where she sees others like herself in the same scenario. A woman at a kitchen table crying while her ""child"" watches staticky alien gibberish on TV. Gemma recognizes that desperation in her eyes before falling into other homes with other couples raising other imposters, landing on the bathroom floor of someone who just couldn't take it and decided to ""release"" himself early, before tumbling down the stairs of the inescapable number 9. This is what suburban life is like; behind every picket fence and well-manicured lawn is a family going through their own emotional struggles...all wishing they had their s**t together, but no one ever really does. All at some point wanting to run away from it all, but never really able to.And, of course, this cycle ends in the inevitable. Death. While the new generation sets to work quickly finding other suckers to rope in.If you're watching this for what it is on the surface alone, don't bother. You likely won't enjoy it. You likely won't understand the underlying themes. The acting is good, Imogen Poots is GREAT, the art is a 70s trip, and the symbolism is solid.",Vivarium

All of these things in this movie are only bad if you aren't ready or don't want them to happen, having a home isn't a bad thing, having a child isn't a bad thing, but they certainly can be if it's not what you want but it's what you think is expected of you.",Vivarium

1114,ricardo-yacine,Disaster,1,17 October 2020,"The ugliest movie in the world , an empty story without events, only slow repetition and the emd has no meaning .. I wasted an hour and a half from my life, please do not watch it and give it a zero in the rating",Vivarium

1117,rjonkergouw,TRUE ART!!,10,23 June 2020,"As others have said, this movie is about the imprisonment of marriage, the forced way of how we raise children, and the emptiness of the pre-fabricated lives we live.Many reviewers have said they missed more explanation, more guidance in the movie and not such a bleak ending that left most of us dissatisfied.But this is exactly the real point of the movie... I don't want to put any spoilers in this comment, but the ending is specifically made as it is so that the viewer his or her mind has an opportunity to shift to another place. Not many will be able to experience it, but I surely did and so it ""clicked"".When I finished watching the movie, and I had watched it late at night in a totally dark room but the television screen, I must say I felt pretty empty, but a bit later, laying in bed, something shifted... suddenly the part of ""me"" that lives through identifying with this empty, life-draining, stuckness routine the movie portrays, just dropped away... and I came into a tranquil state where all the worries related to this (silly) prison-like life fell away and left me feel very free in fact.Would the script have given more explanations, and therefore being less open, surely my mind would have taken that information and place it somewhere in its framework so that ""life is explained"" and I would stay stuck in that mindset.This is TRUE ART!! But if one's mind is really stuck, and does not have any imagination of how a free life could be for oneself, then this movie just pulls you down into an already present subconscious misery. A hopelessness that is there.... Hence, the many bad reviews.",Vivarium
1118,charleshafron,Just not very good,1,7 February 2021,They never really explain why any of this is happening or how this is happening. No answers just weird and frankly not entertaining 👎🏻👎🏻,Vivarium
1119,facenazy,That's a bullisht,1,29 March 2020,I don't believe that I watched till the end.. Please don't make movies like that ever again.,Vivarium
1120,bwashin,Ok .... confusing movie I have questions!,5,10 August 2020,The plot kinda made since but I have questions throughout out this whole movie. Like what would have happen if they never raised the child? What would have happened if they decided to to do what Tom suggested? Also what was the importance of whether they had kids or not? I could go on and on. I will agree the movie had my attention but the ending was a empty hole. I really wanted to see how the MAN they raised was going to interacted with people and the end.,Vivarium
1121,saturninestigma,"Disappointing, not what I anticipated",4,20 July 2020,"Honestly, I had pretty high hopes for this film. I really enjoy Imogen Poots and Jesse Eisenberg and I thought they would have some interesting chemistry on-screen. The story seemed captivating enough from the trailer: A young couple meets up with an unusual real estate salesman to look at a house in a picturesque residential neighborhood, and they get trapped into a hellish suburbia where their only chance of survival is to raise a child delivered to them in a box. I was interested to see what direction it would take and unfortunately, it didn't deliver. The movie sets you up for a thrill-ride and just kind of... stops once it establishes itself. Once Gemma and Tom give up and accept their fate, the movie takes a turn for the worse. I feel like there were a lot of missed opportunities in this film for scares and uncomfortable moments that the director just didn't take. The character development (ESPECIALLY Imogen Poots' character) is really inconsistent, and their motives don't make a whole lot of sense. Why is it that Gemma suddenly decides to care about this child? There's really no lead up to her tacitly accepting her role as ""mother"". She just kind of... does it one day, with little to no explanation for her behavior. Why is Tom so set on digging this hole? The ending is painfully predictable and unsatisfying. Overall, this movie reads like a crappy episode of the Twilight Zone. It had a lot of potential, but it also fell flat in a lot of places.",Vivarium

Just wasted my time, can't believe one could make this much empty & meaningless movie. No reason no conclusion no meaning. Just a complete fiction at it's worst.",Vivarium

I hope it manages to recoup its production costs and the team behind it can continue to make challenging and thought provoking movies",Vivarium

1128,alikiedrowski-62358,Real eyes the mess-age,10,13 July 2020,"You must bee well versed in symbolism and have a deep inner-standing of our predicament to appreciate the film. Each and every word spoken has a meaning. Including the ones that sounded 'silly.' Quite a crafty film, pun intended. It does take intelligence to over-stand the concept.Is IT A.I.? Is IT an alien? Is IT a demon? Is IT a mockingbird? Is IT all of the above?",Vivarium

i mean the beginning was fun, the concept was really good but.... the movie got kinda boring... we get it they're stuck in that neighbourhood and....? we get it he's watching weird tv and??? what's that's? what are those numbers??? oh you're not gonna tell us... uh okay. trying to be intriguing or mysterious but it was just so annoying, they really had a chance... woosh",Vivarium
1131,aotawney,Existential horror,8,30 March 2020,"Very neat. The film presents the analogy up front and then explores its implications clearly. The creators weren't egotistical enough to obscure its meaning, but it still felt rewarding when they zipped it up at the end. It's as cynical as it gets, which I appreciated in terms of it making for a less typical kind of horror. It comforted me with dread. We think we're free to do as we choose, to create a meaningful life, but both the cuckoo and its unwitting foster parents are pre-programmed, permitted pleasure only where it serves to perpetuate the inescapably futile cycle. At least, that was the space I happily dwelt in for the duration. Afterwards one has to get up and get on with it. What's the purpose of it all? The purpose is to die, of course :PI can't resist noting how ironic it is that some did not enjoy the film, yet felt compelled to stick it out until the end anyway - sort of like digging your own grave...",Vivarium

1133,spike_mf,Blunt try being philosophical,4,28 December 2020,"First of, the acting was great and is why it gets any stars at all. As someone stated before, the point of the story is that it's pointless and it's probably ment to be a reflection on our on lives and what makes them matter.
It started of well, with a lot of potential but ended up more like an essay about the circle of life by a teenager with no ambitions and imagination.",Vivarium
1134,gregorywinters,"Movie fails at storytelling , but thinks itself clever.",1,28 March 2020,"The movie spends the entire 2 hours trying to tell you what you already knew in the first 10 minutes of the film ( cuckoo bird ), but fails to deliver in all aspects of story telling. You are left with interpreting the director's failed metaphor on suburban life being like in a vivarium that has no real freedom, and the clinical indifference of the alien zoo keepers ( that you learn nothing about ) as a stand in for society itself.Stay away, a waste of 2 hours that has zero entertainment value. Slower and more boring than the worst documentary you can think of. This films only purpose is to feed the ego of whatever ""artist"" is responsible for this trash. I think I spent more time writing this review than the director did in making this film.Very disappointed that Jessie Eisenberg decided to be in such a film.",Vivarium
