0,bkoganbing,Invested with nobility,8,23 July 2012,"Anthony Minghella knew something of the Civil War in locating his story in North Carolina. Of all the states that seceded to form the Confederacy, North Carolina may have been the most reluctant. It's Governor Zebulon Vance who is mentioned in the story dragged his feet in giving help to the Confederate government and its citizens save for the east where the plantations were never really embraced the Southern cause. Jude Law's attitude about fighting for a rich man to own slaves was not at all uncommon in North Carolina.Which after a well staged recreation of the siege at Petersburg which when the north blew up the Confederate defenses by tunneling under and mining them with explosives did not have the desired result, Law decides he's sick of war and just quits to go back to his sweetheart Nicole Kidman on Cold Mountain. In the meantime Nicole is having her own problems just keeping body, soul, and property together on the small family farm. So the film proceeds along two tracks of Law's journey and Kidman's problems.The stronger track for me is clearly Kidman and her problems. Renee Zellweger won a Best Supporting Actress Award for playing a young white trash woman who Kidman takes on for just board and feed to help with the farm. Without her help the farm's survival would be problematic although she has to put up with some pithy observation as well. Zellweger invests this simple character with so many dimensions her performance even without the Oscar capping it is her personal best. Kidman while not to the plantation manor born being the daughter of minister Donald Sutherland also is not used to manual farm labor. She grows in character as the film progresses.As for Law and Kidman as well he has to worry about the Home guard, a self appointed group of militia taking over because official government machinery has broken down. Probably before the war they were slave catchers, now they hunt deserters and those who aid and abet them. Giovanni Ribisi also scores well as a young man in the home guard who declined to serve at places like Petersburg. Ribisi is some piece of work.Besides Zellweger's Oscar, Cold Mountain was deservedly nominated for a flock of other Oscars. It's a marvelous look at the decline of the Confederacy, a cause that simply would not die quietly. In its own way the survivors are invested with the same kind of nobility that the Gone With The Wind cast was.",Cold Mountain
1,Leofwine_draca,Plodding,4,10 March 2015,"Why are Anthony Minghella's films so plodding? I remember seeing THE English PATIENT at cinemas back in the day and being astonished at how long it felt. Okay, TRULY MADLY DEEPLY was acceptable but still could have been shortened a little. COLD MOUNTAIN is the worst yet, as what should be a Civil War epic turns out to be a lengthy and often routine melodrama with little to recommend it.Perhaps the novel was at fault too, although as I haven't read it I can't comment. The film is told from the point of view of Jude Law, a wounded soldier whose sole purpose is to get back home to the woman he loves (Nicole Kidman). The film chronicles Law's journey throughout, so why then do we get all the needless boring scenes of Kidman pining for him back home? Just when you thought things couldn't get any worse, in comes Renee Zellweger with a supposedly comedic character and proceeds to reduce it to pantomime level.There are elements to enjoy in COLD MOUNTAIN, not least the battle sequences which are well mounted. Law comes into contact with various characters as the story progresses, some of them engaging (Philip Seymour Hoffman), others less so; Ray Winstone seems particularly underdeveloped in a supporting role. But after a couple of hours or so it all gets rather repetitive, and you wish they'd just get on with it instead of dragging things out so much. The ending is particularly anticlimactic.",Cold Mountain
2,SnoopyStyle,don't care for the romance,5,31 December 2014,"Before the war, Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) and Reverend Monroe (Donald Sutherland) arrive in Cold Mountain, North Carolina. She immediately falls for Inman (Jude Law) and they become sweethearts. In 1864, Union sappers set off a large charge under the Confederate trenches outside of Petersburg where Inman is stationed. Union soldiers charge into the crater and are trapped under heavy Confederate fire. Inman is injured by friendly fire. After reading a letter from Ada, he deserts to go back to Cold Mountain. Meanwhile Ada's father dies and she is unable to work the farm alone without slaves. She is hounded by a home guard soldier. Her neighbor Swangers (Kathy Baker) sends her Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger) to help.The movie starts with a very impressive battle. It is one of the grittiest vision of the ugliness of war. After that, the movie depends on the romance. The overwrought melodramatic romance doesn't strike me with any heat. It is literally the proverbial love at first sight. In great film romances, they spend a little time building to that point. It is usually time well spent. This is no Scarlett and Butler. In fact, Nicole Kidman makes me want to ring her neck like that rooster. The Old South of Cold Mountain before the war is a beautiful lush gentle place with few references to slavery. I guess that's fine although they mention that the Monroes let go of their slaves. It seems like a good thing to put on screen. Inman's journey seems fascinating but very random. Renée Zellweger may have won the Academy Awards but it's a bracing performance next to Kidman's. Overall, there are interesting scenes but most of all, I find the romance rather uninspired. This is no 'Gone With the Wind'.",Cold Mountain
3,Hitchcoc,The Slender Thread,9,7 December 2006,"I've always reacted against the ugliness of war. The politicians who send others to fight for them, sitting back, pontificating about the justice of battle. This is a slice of life story where two people are victims of forces they can only hope to avoid. Having read the book and knowing how it ended (no spoilers here), I sat back and watched what went on, seeing how certain figures were presented. Renee Zelwigger as Ruby, of course, dominates every scene she is in. She takes it all on. She is equipped to survive where others are not. I would like to find out if there really were groups of raiders who sought out deserters. I sometimes wonder if people knew half the time who was actually in a battalion, let alone sending out warrants on them. Were people pursued like Jude Law was? I need to find a Civil War scholar. The movie is episodic, like a modern day Odyssey. Every obstacle just leads to a more overwhelming one. Was there no kindness? Were all betrayers? Anyway, I felt a great sense of having been in a fight at the conclusion of this film. See it for its intensity and its life. Some of the acting is a bit wooden, but the course is rough and the way hard. That's what the film is all about.",Cold Mountain
4,claudio_carvalho,A Beautiful Romance in Times of War,9,13 September 2004,"In Cold Mountain, North Colorado, near to the period of the American Civil War, the Reverend Monroe (Donald Sutherland) arrives in the small town with his daughter, the shy Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), due to health reasons. Ada meets the also shy Inman (Jude Law), and they fall in love with each other. With the beginning of the war, Inman becomes a soldier, and his great support to stay alive is the wish to see Ada in Cold Mountain again. Meanwhile, Ada meets Ruby Thewes (Renée Zellweger), a survivor of the war, who helps her in the farm and becomes her best friend. The story alternates present and past situations, disclosing a beautiful romance. I liked this film a lot. Having names such as Philip Seymour Hoffman, Natalie Portman and Giovanni Ribisi in the supporting cast, a magnificent direction of Anthony Minghella and seven indications to the Oscar, this movie does not disappoint. My remark is that there are some very important scenes deleted in the story and presented in the DVD. At least one of them, which show what happens with Sara, her baby and the three dead bodies in her farm, should not be deleted as it was. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): 'Cold Mountain'",Cold Mountain
5,classicsoncall,"""Come back to me is my request.""",9,30 August 2018,"The opening battle scene at the siege of Petersberg is filmed in a truly epic manner. If one doesn't comprehend the very real horror of blood and guts fighting while battling the muddy elements that go along with it, those gut wrenching scenes will stay with you a long time. They serve as a chilling counterpoint to the flashback scene of jubilant Southern farm boys who couldn't wait for North Carolina to enter the war. Many of them would not make it home. But the film isn't about the Civil war so much as one man's attempt to return to an idealistic vision of a woman he holds in his heart and mind. To do so, he must find the wherewithal to desert from the Confederate Army and undertake a grueling journey on foot to his former home at Cold Mountain. You can't really say that Inman's (Jude Law) behavior was admirable, as a deserter he would be hunted down by forces on both sides of the conflict. Yet there is something stoic about his resolve in the face of the war's inhumanity and the way it tramples on a man's dignity and self respect. Quite honestly, even though a number of reviewers here found Renee Zellweger's character to be intolerable, I thought Ruby Thewes was a hoot and a half. As much as she was embarrassing, there was a quality of loyalty and discipline to her character that helped mold Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) into a more well rounded individual. For most of the story, Kidman appeared to be just a bit too glamorous given the circumstances of her life at Cold Mountain, so Zellweger provided a much needed balance. I think this might have been the first movie I ever saw Renee Zellweger in, and it's not the type of role one forgets easily.I originally saw this film in the theater upon it's original release and hadn't gotten back to it until the other day. It still retains the drama and power of my first viewing, though for it's intense battle scenes and majestic cinematography, one's best bet is to catch it whenever possible on the big screen.",Cold Mountain
6,lee_eisenberg,travel from the war,9,7 November 2017,"I should start by noting that I've never read the novel on which Anthony Minghella's ""Cold Mountain"" is based. Seeing the movie on its own, I can say that it's a good movie. The gist of it is that war damages all sides involved. Inman (Jude Law) and Ada (Nicole Kidman) have vastly dissimilar experiences in the US Civil War but they both get affected by it. Even after the war, the effects will take years or even decades to heal.The most interesting character in the movie is Ruby (Renée Zellweger). From a background unlike Ada's, she always has something to say. But she, like the other characters, won't remain untouched by the events surrounding her.One of the points made with the movie is that not every southerner at the time was a slave-owning racist. Plenty of them rejected the plantation system and simply wanted to live their lives. It was unfortunate that the events of the ten years following the Civil War resulted in the old Confederates rising to power again and establishing the Jim Crow Laws, resulting in almost a century of institutionalized racism.Anyway, it's worth seeing. Zellweger deserved her Oscar for her role.",Cold Mountain
7,jboothmillard,Cold Mountain,6,5 December 2006,"I heard about this at the Oscars, a countdown show, and saw the trailer, and the result of the seeing the film was alright. The film does start off going backwards in time with Inman (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Jude Law) meeting Ada Monroe (Golden Globe nominated Nicole Kidman) and they have a short close relationship before he leaves to fight in the Civil War. He comes close to losing his life, but is rescued and has no way to find his ""love"" but to go back to her town, Cold Mountain. Meanwhile, she believes he is dead, and a lot happens to her as he is travelling. Her Dad, Reverend Monroe (Donald Sutherland) dies, and she gets a new friend acting almost as a servant, Ruby Thewes (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe winning Renée Zellweger). He does get back eventually, after many stops and some captures, and do get to have a proper love, till the almost-teary ending. Also starring Eileen Atkins as Maddy, Brendan Gleeson as Stobrod Thewes, Philip Seymour Hoffman as Reverend Veasey, Natalie Portman as Sara, Giovanni Ribisi as Junior, Ray Winstone as Teague, Kathy Baker as Sally Swanger, James Gammon as Esco Swanger, Charlie Hunnam as Bosie, Jack White as Georgia and My Name Is Earl's Ethan Suplee as Pangle. Zellweger was good, I guess she deserved her Oscar against the other nominees, but she should have won for a better role, say Chicago or Bridget Jones. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Music, Original Score for Gabriel Yared, Best Original Song for T-Bone Burnett and Elvis Costello's ""Scarlet Tide"", and Best Original Song for Sting's ""You Will Be My Ain True Love"" (also nominated the Golden Globe), it won the BAFTA for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music, and it was nominated for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, Best Cinematography, Best Costume Design, Best Editing, Best Make Up/Hair, Best Production Design, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Sound, the David Lean Award for Direction for Anthony Minghella (The English Patient), and Best Film, and it was nominated the Golden Globes for Best Director, Best Motion Picture - Drama, Best Original Score, and Best Screenplay. It was number 96 on The 100 Greatest War Films. Good!",Cold Mountain
8,ccthemovieman-1,Deserters Are Good; Catching Them Is Bad,3,13 December 2006,"I found the first 90 minutes of this film to be very interesting, even though a few parts of it were ridiculous (i.e.. Philip Seymour Hoffman's character). The last 60 minutes were distasteful and I began to lose interest in the film. The last hour lasted forever, it seemed.The movie is nicely acted and I can see why Rene Zellweger won an Academy Award since her character was so interesting. The movie also is beautifully filmed and the story is an emotional one. However, I found the message to be a bad one: not surprising these days in Hollywood. In this story, ""Inman"" (Jude Law) deserts the Confederate Army during the Civil War. His reason: his girlfriend misses him and wants him home. He's also getting disillusioned with war. (Can you imagine if every soldier who was in a similar boat deserted the army in the two world wars??!)Yet, in this film of course, all of that is perfectly acceptable. Then again, what Liberal filmmaker has ever had a nice thing to say about the U.S. military?? To add to their left-wing slant, they portray a vigilante-like posse going after deserters as cold-blooded sick killers. Well, in the world of films, as we know: good is portrayed as bad and bad is good.....and only Liberals would portray deserters as heroes.",Cold Mountain
9,rmax304823,War is all hell.,6,26 July 2005,"There's a stunning scene towards the end when Jude Law approaches his long-lost girlfriend, Nicole Kidman, on a snowy path through what appears to be an archway of rock pinnacles all dusted with white. Law is hardly more than a scrawny black scarecrow in a slouch hat. Not recognizing him after a year's absence she fires two warning shots towards him. He is shaken and begins to turn away, thinking she's forgotten him, but then awareness comes to her and she calls out, ""Inman?"" Now, what follows ought to be a slow-motion shot of the two figures running towards each other and weeping with joy. She runs and weeps and laughs in slow motion. He runs and weeps and laughs in slow motion. But, no. Minghella, the director, has Law and Kidman crunch towards one another cautiously, as if neither is entirely certain that what is happening is not an hallucination. And Minghella cuts away from the reunion after only a brief and tasteful moment.The movie is a series of rather loosely linked episodes, cutting back and forth between Law making his lonely and dangerous way back home from the battlefield, and Kidman who is about to starve on her wretched farm because, as a gentlewoman, she was taught only what was useless. She can name all the plants in Latin but she can't grow them. Renee Zellweger shows up at the opportune moment, a no-nonsense practical independent and blunt young woman who is able to show Kidman the ropes.The initial meeting between Law and Kidman only lasts for a few minutes, and they are together at the end just long enough for the anticipated climax, so to speak, but everything in between the beginning and the end kind of meanders about, like one of the ox bow lakes that Law must traverse during his journey. What the heck is going on?What seems to be going on is mostly two things. First, the movie gives us a pretty good ethnographic picture of the folks who lived in the Upland South in the 1860s. (Good production design and wardrobe.) There are no magnificent steps in the Big House for Bette Davis to trip down in a hoop skirt, just old weathered shacks whose shingles need replacing and whose corn cribs must be filled if the inhabitants are to survive the winter. Come to think of it, there are no hoop skirts at all. Everyone is dressed in more than usually drab garments, usually dirty. Even the women's underwear is yellow and blotched. The dialog isn't noticeably Upland South though. In the Lowland South, say around Charleston, ""sir"" becomes ""suh,"" but in the mountains it is ""sirr."" Not an important point.Because of their beards and raggedy clothing the men tend to look alike. They all look like Chuck Norris, unless they are older and look like James Gammon. In fact one of them IS James Gammon. Nicole Kidman's visage is as sleek as her figure. She could be the hood ornament on an old, ornate automobile.Some of the episodes are more interesting than others although it was never too difficult to figure out who would survive and who would die. Philip Seymour Hoffman as one of those pasquinades of pastoral piety is a riot. What music he lends his lines! And at one point Law is invited to spend the night in bed with Natalie Portman, her husband long dead, who writhes with grief, guilt, and horniness as she asks him to promise that if he lies down next to her he ""won't go no further."" Righto! It reminded me of a similar scene in which a lad was successfully tested in ""Tales of the Arabian Nights"", to which the translator, Richard Burton, had added a rare footnote -- ""The young man must have been a demon of chastity.""I have a feeling there is a moral to this movie. The moral is that war should be entered into only as a last resort, but I'm not sure.",Cold Mountain
10,ma-cortes,Sensitive film with great interpretations and spectacular outdoors,7,12 February 2005,"The movie deals about American Civil War (1861-1865) , the starring (Jude Law , though Matt Damon, Josh Hartnett, Leonardo DiCaprio, and Eric Bana were all considered for this role) meets Ada (Nicole Kidman , though Julia Roberts and Cate Blanchett were both considered) in ¨Cold mountain¨ and they fall in love . Then he's enlisted and participates in Battle of Saint Petesburg (Virginia 1864). He leaves and sets off to find his lover . Being dead her father (Donald Sutherland), Nicole will have to confront a lot of misfortunes until that she's helped by a valiant woman (Renee Zellweger) .The picture is overlong , runtime is approx. three hours but is neither boring , nor tiring , but entertaining for the reason that happen several events . The film blends epic battles, drama , a love story, shootouts and a little bit of violence . The motion picture is pretty strong with crude scenes : the bloody battles ,rampages , rape , murders...it has many violent shots , for that reason the film is rated ¨R¨ as the violence is extreme with cruel killings , besides some sex scenes.In United States attained a moderated success in spite of nomination to various Oscars , though only obtained one award to support cast for Renee Zellweger . In Europe achieved much more success at the box office . The picture has spectacular sets and some wonderful snowy and natural landscapes. Many of the scenes were shot in the Carpathian mountains in Romania . The production design and set design by Dante Ferretti is breathtaking .Jude Law and Nicole Kidman interpretation is top notch likeness to Renee Zellweger rightly rewarded . The secondary actors are first rate : The hideous Ray Winstone , the renegade priest Philip Seymour Hoffman , the kind Bernard Gleeson , everybody are good. Gabriel Yared musical score is romantic and magnificent and John Seale cinematography is astounding and stunningly made . Anthony Mingella direction is accurately developed but there're some moments with slightly slow movement . The flick will appeal to emotion enthusiasts and romantic films fans . Rating: Very good . Above average , well worth watching.",Cold Mountain
11,moonspinner55,"Civil War drama with epic grandeur and well-judged details, but curiously cast and ultimately draining...",5,25 November 2007,"In 1860s North Carolina, the daughter of a recently-deceased Reverend awaits a handsome carpenter's return from war, unaware that he was wounded after several violent battles with the Yankees and deserted his troop; meanwhile, with no means of support, she takes in a female ranch-hand to help transpose her bedraggled farm. Director Anthony Minghella, who also adapted the screenplay from Charles Frazier's book, shows a masterly tableaux feel for wartime savagery, and his openings moments of battle are vivid, acrid, and powerful. The unconsummated love story between Nicole Kidman and Jude Law doesn't work as well, mainly due to the past-and-present story structure but also because of the casting, which fails to come off. Kidman seems too womanly for this role--too alert and capable and grown-up--so it doesn't quite wash (in the dramatic sense) for her to be pining after a young man after just one goodbye kiss (and why did she pick him in the first place? we've already been told she could have any man she wanted); Law, who overdoes his performance with too much emphasis on his haunted stare, is a really odd choice to play a Southern American left alienated by wartime; Oscar winner Renée Zellweger comes into the picture at just the right time and, though her accent doesn't completely convince, she gives the proceedings a little spirit. Minghella treats this scenario with great care, and he triumphs with small, individual scenes (such as the slaves hiding in the cornfield with their basket of eggs, the rotting corncobs on the stalk, the drift of the first winter snow), but he loses his way intermittently (mostly with the extraneous story threads, such as the one with the preacher about to kill a slave because ""she's got my bastard in her belly!""). The howlers in the script are not gingerly trotted out--the whole film, with its pluses and minuses, is unashamedly forthright and unsubtle. Still, this treatment only works on occasion, and the length is self-defeating. ** from ****",Cold Mountain
12,Quinoa1984,One of those kinds of pictures practically budgeted to get Oscar nominations,7,26 December 2003,"Anthony Minghella, responsible for such films as The English Patient (which I did not like despite the acclaim) and The Talented Mr. Ripley (which I liked), returns with another adaptation- Cold Mountain, which entails the romance-during-civil war scenario passed down by the Gone with the Wind movie gods. Jude Law and Nicole Kidman play two people, Inman and Ada, who've barely known each other before Law goes off to fight in the War, but they write (Kidman contributes voice-overs that more often than not don't work or aren't needed for the story) to one another, that is until he witnesses a terrible battle years later. He becomes a deserter, as he travels across wild parts of the South on her way back to her. During this time Ada's father dies, and she's all alone until a girl from the mountains who's also lost her father, Ruby (Renee Zellweger), comes down to help on the farm. It doesn't take this reviewer to tell where the story is headed, and that's probably how Minghella liked it set up (from Charles Frazier's book). There's much that I liked about Cold Mountain: the strong, period-perfect production design by Dante Ferretti, an entertaining battle sequence near the beginning, and an all-star cast that, though mostly supporting, does it's job well. And among the Oscar nominations the film is bound to receive (from my perspective this film follows in the tradition that Miramax puts out at least one film every year around this time to garner some space in the audience at the show), I'd say that Zellweger could perhaps get her's. What I didn't think was all that great about the movie, and what makes it over-rated, is that it's a story that makes itself too clear that this will happen now, and this will happen in the next scene, and in a few minutes we can expect this, and so on. The presence of confederate soldiers, always on the look out for traitors around Ada's region, makes it all too by-the-books, so to speak. A couple of minutes could've been chopped off as well. Is it a well made movie? yes, but maybe it's TOO well made for its own good.",Cold Mountain
13,edwagreen,Give COLD MOUNTAIN the Cold Shoulder,1,6 January 2005,"What a lousy, boring picture.Jude Law was horribly miscast in this civil war yarn. Nicole Kidman pulls out all the stops to emulate Scarlett O'Hara but does not and Renee Zellwegger gives a performance that I quite did not understand. The best supporting actress winner spoke like she had marbles in her mouth. That combined with her southern drawl made her impossible to understand.Can't fathom that Kathy Baker recovered so quickly following the horrible massacre of her husband and sons. They ought to use Miss Baker as a grieving counselor in a public high school. Nice job of getting back to yourself quickly, Miss Baker, but it was inappropriate.Jude Law appeared to be able to survive anything in this grim civil war tale. I couldn't wait for him to get back to Ms. Kidman so that this darn movie could end.The civil war battle scenes can't match Atlanta in ""Gone With the Wind.""A real stinker.",Cold Mountain
14,jotix100,Tintypes,8,1 January 2004,"This Miramax film epic, directed by Anthony Minghella, will, no doubt, be hyped to the heavens by the studio in order for it to garner as many prizes as possible. Comments from viewers in this forum seem to indicate they love the film, which, at first glance has all the qualities to merit them. However, this Civil War story of romance in the midst of conflict, feels empty as soon as it ends. This film doesn't stay in one's memory for a lot longer than its 155 minutes of projection.Inman and Ada love affair is a bit a bit far fetched. Not only do they come from different backgrounds, but they don't appear to have anything in common. In the South of before the Civil War, with its class distinctions, Ada and Inman wouldn't have had a chance, let alone, have the long distance love affair that seems to hold the narrative.The other problem the film has is the many fake Southern accents, which is understandable when an international cast has been assembled to recreate the same Southerners that wouldn't probably understand what they're talking about. After all is said and done,  Ada only gets to keep Inman's image in the tintype picture he gives her, and as another Southern heroine, Scarlet O'Hara, she will survive the tragedy and come out ahead of the game.",Cold Mountain
15,LeonLouisRicci,Depressing and Desparing,7,12 April 2013,"Overly long and depressing account of mostly the Southern Homefront during the Civil War. This is not at all a pleasant time Historically and it is just the same in this well mounted Production. With Mega-Stars and Mega Character Actors it is one unpleasantness after another with very little left to the imagination.There was a lot of dreaming and romanticizing during and about this period mostly to conceal the unbelievable pain and suffering but none of that can hide here. This is an anti-war Movie no doubt and it pulls no punches in that regard. But it is so agonizing the Romantic elements can barely penetrate all the nastiness. Overall, it is a truly disturbing display of Wars inevitable intrusion into the participants lives and dramatically deconstructed the Heart and Soul and renders the most basic Humanisms, but it is not a pretty picture and is quite a despairing piece of work",Cold Mountain

17,zardoz-13,Bold Mountain!!!,10,25 February 2015,"""English Patient"" director Anthony Minghella died before his time. Nevertheless, he made one of the more memorable movies about the American Civil War. Adapting Charles Frazier's first novel, writer & director Minghella depicted aspects of the War Between the States that no other film else has ever detailed. First, this epic length war film unfolds with the disastrous Battle of the Crater at Petersburg in 1864. Late in the war, Union troops tunneled beneath Confederate lines and detonated explosives that they had stockpiled in a mine. Indeed, this constituted a daring maneuver, but the Union didn't take into account the consequences of such a plan and they paid dearly for their audacity. Our sympathetic protagonist, Inman (Jude Law of ""Alfie""), is one of many Southern soldiers resting in a trench who got the surprise of their lives. Moments before the explosion, a rabbit tears through their trench and not long afterward the charges ignited and blew up the area. The spectacle of the explosion is truly incredible. Afterward, Union troops poured into the crater as they charged Southern lines, but the rebels trapped them in the crater. ""Cold Mountain"" not only deals with the battlefront, but also it concerns the home front. After Inman and his friends enthusiastically march off to war, some of the most notorious citizens, led by Teague (Ray Winstone of ""Beowulf""), establish a Home Guard. The Home Guard has the right to enter anybody's home if they suspect the occupants are housing deserters, and they may even be able to confiscate the property. Teague and his evil henchman, including Boise (Charlie Hunnam of TV's ""Sons of Anarchy""), exploit these opportunities for their monetary gain, too.Aside from these two little seen events, Minghella assembled a strong stellar cast. As Ada Monroe, the refined daughter of the widowed Reverend Monroe (Donald Sutherland of ""M.A.S.H.""), Nicole Kidman is a young lady who has been raised like an aristocrat in Charleston, South Carolina, and has led an insular life. She doesn't know any practical to do, except play the piano. The Reverend Monroe left Charleston for reasons concerning his declining health. When they arrive in Cold Mountain, Ada meets Inman while his friends and he are erecting Reverend Monroe's church. Ada and Inman mingle now and then, but they never indulge themselves in hugs and kisses until the day that Inman must depart for war. After the opening Petersburg battle, Minghella shifts back and forth between Ada and Inman. Ada's father dies and she struggles to survive on a farm that she knows nothing about until her neighbors send her a laborer, Ruby (Renée Zellweger) who gets everything back in order for Ada and teaches her how to survive. Meantime, Inman leaves a hospital and deserts. He spends most of his time on foot avoiding groups of Home Front horsemen. Along the way, he encounters a hypocritical preacher, Reverend Veasey (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who has impregnated an African-American slave woman and plans to murder her. Inman thwarts the minister's plans and compels him to suffer the wrath of his congregation. Miraculously, Veasey escapes and stumbles across Inman later during his flight. ""Cold Mountain"" qualifies as first-class from fade-in to fade-out, with a top-notch supporting cast, including Natalie Portman, Jena Malone, Brendan Gleeson, Giovanni Ribisi, Katy Baker, and Lucas Black. No expense appears to have been overlooked by Minghella in this impressive $79-million production that was partially lensed on location in the Carpathian Mountains in Romania. If you consider yourself a Civil War fan, you should enjoy this movie.Interestingly enough, as an afterward of sorts to my comment about the Civil War and this film, historian Gary W. Gallagher cites Minghella from an interview about the director's sentiments about the Civil War and its relevance to ""Cold Mountain."" Minghella words can be found in Gallagher's book ""Causes Won, Lost, & Forgotten: How Hollywood and Popular Art Shape What We Know About The Civil War."" Says Minghella, ""This film is not a history lesson. It doesn't exist to stand in for a study of a real event. Rather, it tries to cast light on some circumstances which surround any war . . . . If I thought I was making a Civil War film, then I wouldn't have taken this project on.""",Cold Mountain
18,Boba_Fett1138,Certainly watchable but many things in the movie restrain it from being a masterpiece.,7,27 January 2006,"""Cold Mountain"" is a beautifully made movie with a great celebrity cast, than why don't I regard this movie as a masterpiece? There are several reasons for this.The heart of the movie is the love-story between the Nicole Kidman and Jude Law character. Everything that happens in the movie evolves around the fact that both characters are deeply in love and are always on each others mind. But problem is that the love-story is not believable at all. The love-story feels unlikely because there is no chemistry between Jude Law and Nicole Kidman at all. No click, no spark no nothing at all. Maybe this is also because the love-story in the movie is very underdeveloped. The love-story is only developed in the beginning of the movie when they are still together but honestly, that period of time is too short to build an entire movie around. It makes all of the other things that occur in the movie also extra unlikely.Which brings me to another problem I had with the movie; it was highly unlikely at times. The events and characters in the movie seem to pop out of nowhere. Obviously the story is supposed to be an adventurous one but yet the movie is made too serious so all the sense of adventure and fun is not present enough. All of the events in the movie feel highly unlikely and most of them lack a point or purpose.The big celebrity cast is great to watch but is also the downfall of the movie. Most actors suddenly pop up so every time a celebrity appears on screen you're thinking; 'Hey look there is Natalie Portman and hey there is Philip Seymour Hoffman, boy this movie sure has some celebrities in it'. Point is, it works distracting from the movie and it's story. It almost feels at times like they were bragging up by showing the many famous actors they got to appear in this movie. Yes, sure the actors are just absolutely great, especially Philip Seymour Hoffman, Renée Zellweger (yes, she deserved her Oscar even though I din't always liked her character) and Natalie Portman. Still I have the feeling that the movie would had been a better one with a more 'unknown' cast in it.Only reason why I still rate this movie as 'highly' as I do is due to the obvious profession it was made with. Director Anthony Minghella shows some moments of greatness and the settings and sceneries are quite beautiful. It also is no punishment to watch the big celebrity cast in the movie, even though still the movie is a 'celebrity-overkill' at times. The movie is loved by many, so I guess this is just simply not my cup of tea.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Cold Mountain
19,evanston_dad,Anthony Minghella Tries for the Great American Movie (and Fails),5,30 August 2010,"There is a difference between a movie about a grueling journey and a grueling movie, but ""Cold Mountain"" didn't get that memo.Director Anthony Minghella is cut from the same cloth as Sam Mendes: both are non-American directors who try time and again to make the great American movie and fail.""Cold Mountain"" is about a man (Jude Law) who goes on a bizarre odyssey from the battlefields of the Civil War back into the arms of his true love (Nicole Kidman). The journey is harrowing and unpleasant, and Minghella makes us feel every ounce of it without counteracting the unpleasantness with any suggestion as to why we should care.Law is good, Kidman is bland, and Renee Zellweger is ridiculous in a hammy performance as a Southern good ol' gal. A bunch of famous people (like Philip Seymour Hoffman, Eileen Atkins and Natalie Wood) pop up in cameos. It's kind of like a dismal Southern version of ""Around the World in 80 Days.""

20,ferguson-6,"Awright Then ... a rooster, a goat, a fiddle and Zeger",7,3 January 2004,"Greetings again from the darkness.  My first movie of 2004 has already shown up on most critic's top 10 list for last year so my expectations were high, yet tempered with the knowledge that director Anthony Minghella was responsible for ""The English Patient"" (the focus of one of the funniest ""Seinfeld"" episodes).  What an unbelievable cast Minghella assembled.  Every scene brought a recognizable star.  However, as feared, the story is excruciatingly predictable throughout.  The wonderful performances make the movie quite watchable, but never should such a predictable story land on a best movie list of any respectable film lover.  Surprisingly, Renee' Zellweger is most impressive in her quite less-than-glamourous role while firing off one liners to pick up the pace in the painfully slow dialogue. The stellar cast includes the leads, Jude Law and Nicole Kidman and the celebrity baggage associated.  Young stars such as Natalie Portman, Jena Malone, Giovanni Ribisi and Charlie Hunnam (""Nicolas Nickelby"") are joined by screen vets such as Donald Sutherland, Kathy Baker, Brendan Gleeson and the great Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  Especially effective and creepy is Hunnam.  Biggest question I have is, why so many foreign actors in a civil war picture?  The battle scenes are filmed wonderfully and the countryside alternates between beautiful and stark and with hope and desperation.  Law and Kidman are fine in the leads, but really have little to do other than look longingly into the lens.  While Minghella knows how to craft a beautiful film, he has yet to figure out how to write a unique screenplay.",Cold Mountain

Set in mid 1800's Jude Law fought in the civil war and suffered injury but he reflects upon the woman awaiting his arrival at Cold Mountain. She is played by Nicole Kidman and she is the daughter of a minister whose lifestyle changes after his passing. This subplot is interesting but Law's trek across country is littered with pointless subplots that greatly weaken his necessity. This climaxes with a simplistic gunfight and shed tears that viewers likely won't fall for. Directed by Anthony Minghella who made a superior film called The English Patient. Here he is backed with fine production. While Law's role becomes greatly expendable, Kidman slowly becomes a woman when a ragged Renee Zellweger appears. They have a fine chemistry as Kidman gets her hands dirty and Zellweger gets her hands dirtier. Among cameos are Phillip Seymour Hoffman as a sleazy minister who steals his moments with humour and found guilty of a crime for which he meets consequences. Natalie Portman has a pointless role as a woman raising an infant son, and whom Law assists in a crucial moment. Theme of emotional endurance is evident in our cold society.

22,HotToastyRag,"Dramatic, heavy war film",4,10 December 2017,"Civil War fans will find a favorite in the romantic drama Cold Mountain. Yes, there's violence, death, and unbearable tension, but that's what you expect when you buckle in for a movie that takes place during the Civil War! This one has a compelling story, good acting, and very authentic production values, so if you like this genre, it's worth it.Jude Law is a Southern soldier who, after being wounded, decides to risk being shot as a deserter and travel home to see his sweetheart Nicole Kidman. While he comes across helpful people, like Natalie Portman, during his journey, he spends most of his time avoiding the bad guys who are out for his head, namely Ray Winstone and Charlie Hunnam. Nicole pines away for Jude and finds it difficult to manage on her own until the feisty, Southern-cliché-ridden tomboy Renée Zellweger shows up and helps her. With Philip Seymour Hoffman, Kathy Baker, Brendan Gleeson, Donald Sutherland, Cillian Murphy, Eileen Atkins, and Giovanni Ribisi in the supporting cast, you know you'll be in for some quality performances, even if the overall aura of the film isn't enjoyable.The most famous element to Cold Mountain, besides the very graphic sex scenes and Nicole Kidman's needless nudity, is the make-up Oscar it won for Renée Zellweger, who had lost the gold the year before for her tour-de-force performance in Chicago. As a native Southerner, playing the tell-it-like-it-is Southerner in Cold Mountain was not a stretch for her acting abilities, and even though I'm sure she was very happy to receive her statue, I'm sure she realized it was a make-up Oscar.Be prepared when you go into it that the movie's a very heavy drama, more on par with Free State of Jones than Gone with the Wind. It's pretty upsetting at times, and will more than likely leave you unsettled in the years after you watch it. My brother cites this as one of the films he wishes he hadn't seen, but I'm used to the type so I wasn't too phased. Use your own judgement whether or not you can handle it, but by all means, put the kiddies to bed before watching it! Kiddy warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, due to nudity, violence, and graphic sex scenes, I wouldn't let my kids watch it. Also, there may or may not be a rape scene.",Cold Mountain
23,Wuchakk,Civil War Odyssey,9,12 January 2011,"A Confederate soldier Inman (Jude Law) deserts in late 1864 to return to the mountains of western North Carolina and his one true love, Ada (Nicole Kidman). Inman experiences many different people, events and obstacles on his long journey while Ada has her own problems to deal with: death, grief, the ruthless ""home guard,"" starvation/poverty, and a house & farm she doesn't know how to run, that is, until the practical Ruby (Renée Zellweger) comes along.Based on the 1997 novel by Charles Frazier, ""Cold Mountain"" (2003) involves two stories that ultimately intertwine and is reminiscent of Homer's Odyssey. In light of Inman's journey home, the film is episodic but, thankfully, never loses its sense of cohesion. The story shows how the war destroyed or corrupted the South on practically every level, not just the soldiers who went off to fight, die, be maimed, desert or suffer defeat, but everyone left behind as well. Every person Inman meets on his journey is somehow damaged or sullied because of the war.For example, in the case of the family in the large cabin the husband's friendliness is dubious. All the eligible men have gone to war and those who return are maimed and scarred. Is it any wonder that the women are love-starved and try to lose themselves in drunkenness and casual sex? As for a couple scenes of overt sexuality, the book & film are contrasting drunken carnal lust with intimate committed love.These scenes are adult-oriented, so be forewarned. I should add that the ""kitchen table woman"" is actress Melora Walters, who played George Costanza's date in ""The Hamptons"" episode of Seinfeld. Meanwhile Natalie Portman shows up for another key sequence.Then there's the immoral & looney ""Reverend"" Veasey (Philip Seymour Hoffman), who may tempt some to view the film as ""anti-Christian,"" but this is a premature judgment in light of the entire story and particularly the ending. Not to mention likable, but shakey religionists like Veasey exist in real life.Not everyone can handle ""Cold Mountain"" because of its hardcore depiction of the horrors of war, madness and immorality, but it's not all death, misery and darkness; these are commendably counterbalanced by the beauty of life, love, loyalty, companionship, poetry and music. ""Cold Mountain"" is an all-around well-made motion picture that cuts the fat out of the book for a more effective story.The film runs 2 hours, 33 minutes, and was shot mostly in the Carpathian Mountains, Romania, but with some scenes done in Virginia, South Carolina, and North Carolina.GRADE: A",Cold Mountain
24,siderite,Kind of slow drama,7,19 June 2005,"This is one of those movies you know how they're going to be from the first scenes. You do see the male and the female liking each other, you know they are going to fall in love, but you watch it all the same to see HOW they are going to proceed on doing that. You know there is a war and you already know how it's going to end, but you watch the fight scenes anyhow. You know he is going to die because she saw it in a prediction and in the movies predictions are law, but you still watch to see how he is going to die. You know who the bad guys are, you know they are going to die every one of them, but you watch to see it happened and get that feeling of relief that life does have a point.OK, the script was better than the average romantic drama, the actors all played well, the sound and direction were great, so you can call Cold Mountain a good movie, but only taken separately from all the other movies in the genre from which it parts only minutely.The nice landscapes in the background are Romanian, by the way, and this is one of the reasons why I chose to see this movie. And while I managed to endure its entire length without fast forwarding and I watched it with my wife, I would not do it again.Conclusion: this is one of those movies you watch with the lady. Nothing more, nothing less. It's not terribly romantic, either, as it fails to convey that ""Ooo"" feeling that makes women feel warm inside.",Cold Mountain
25,JamesHitchcock,A Confederate Odyssey,8,13 February 2004,"Possible SpoilersEver since `Birth of a Nation' and `Gone with the Wind', Hollywood has tended to be over-indulgent towards the Confederacy, playing down the evils of slavery and treating the rebel forces as, at best, romantic heroes and, at the very worst, misguided but nevertheless honourable. `Cold Mountain', which tells the story of a deserter from the Confederate forces during the American Civil War, is a welcome exception to this tendency. The central character Inman, who comes from a remote mountainous area of North Carolina, joins the Confederate army in a fit of bravado along with many other young men from his village. He deserts it not out of cowardice but because he has come to realise that the cause for which he is fighting is a hopeless one, both in the sense that it is doomed to failure and in the sense that it is morally worthless. There is no `romance of the Old South' in this film. The Civil War is shown for what it was- a grim and (on the part of the South) desperately defensive struggle, fought for much of the time in trenches and prefiguring the later stalemate of the First World War. The battle scenes with which the film opens are particularly graphic and dramatic and vividly convey the hardships suffered by the soldiers.After deserting, Inman tries to return to his native village of Cold Mountain and to his sweetheart Ada. The film recounts his many adventures along the way, intercut with scenes showing Ada's life in his absence. (There are echoes of `The Odyssey' in this tale of a soldier facing dangers as he attempts to make his way back to his loved one). Both Inman and Ada face great difficulties. The greatest danger to Inman is not so much the Northern armies as the `Home Guard', a band of Confederate irregulars who ruthlessly hunt down deserters and others they regard as disloyal to their cause. Ada's greatest difficulty is that she is a genteel, well-bred city girl who knows little about farming or housekeeping and finds it difficult to cope with life in a remote village, especially after the death of her clergyman father. She is helped to survive, however, by her friend Ruby, an uneducated but capable and practical young woman.It is interesting that in a film set in America and dealing with one of the central episodes of American history neither of the lead roles is played by an American; Inman is played by the British Jude Law and Ada by the Australian Nicole Kidman. There are a number of other non-Americans in key roles; Ada's father is played by the Canadian Donald Sutherland, and Teague, the villainous leader of the Home Guard, by another Englishman, Ray Winstone. The Israeli Natalie Portman has a role as Sara, a young widow whom Inman meets on his journey. The director, of course, is an Englishman of Italian descent, and the film, despite its ostensible setting, was actually filmed in Rumania. Filmmaking seems to be becoming more international, even when the film concerns an American subject.Nicole Kidman's acting in this part was a pleasant surprise to me. I had previously thought of her as the cinema's equivalent of the duck-billed platypus- happy only in her native Australian habitat- and she has her share of horrors on her CV (`Far and Away', `Batman Forever', the dull `The Peacemaker' and the truly dreadful `Moulin Rouge'). `Cold Mountain' is the first film in which I have seen her since `Flirting' in the early 1990s in which I have felt she was completely at her ease. I am not familiar with the dialects of the Carolinas, so I am not worried about whether her accent was entirely accurate. What matters is that she gives a convincing and touching performance. Jude Law's performance as Inman was adequate but not especially brilliant, and I found his Best Actor nomination surprising. There were good cameos from Portman (a welcome return to form after her `Star Wars' experiences) and from Philip Seymour Hoffman as a lustful preacher. The real star, however, was Renee Zellwegger as Ruby, a character who is ignorant but sensible and crude but sympathetic. Her Best Supporting Actress nomination is one that is well deserved.The other striking feature of the film is its magnificent cinematography, particularly the shots of the mountain scenery. Although the title of the film is taken from the name of the village, it is an appropriate one in that much of the story is set in wintertime, and the memorable scenes of the beautiful but bleak snowbound landscapes are a vivid symbol of one of the coldest, bleakest periods in American history. This is not the best film of 2003 (in my view both `Return of the King' and `Girl with a Pearl Earring' were better), but it is nonetheless an excellent one, a testimony to the human capacity for both cruelty and hope. 8/10.",Cold Mountain

It kind of brought me back to ""Gone With The Wind"". Jude Law and Nicole Kidman are absolutely amazing in the film. Their love scene was one of the most romantic scenes that I've witnessed in a while. I would highly recommend this film. Though it does drag on a little more than I wanted.

27,=G=,Not all that,7,30 June 2004,"A kind of poor man's ""Gone With the Wind"", ""Cold Mountain"" tells of a man (Law) who falls in like with a woman (Kidman) but has to go off to fight for the CSA during the American Civil War. After the battle of Petersburg in late 1864, he deserts and spends the bulk of the 2.5 hour film humping it back home to his kinda-sorta beloved all the while bumping into all manner of peculiar hillbilly characters while Kidman does a sort of Scarlett O'Hara thing trying to maintain a stiff upper lip in the face of cold and deprivation and never having had to do labor before. ""Cold Mountain"" is a worthy albeit Hollywoodized star power and hype film about star crossed would-be lover hillbillies who struggle with the tribulations of the time. The film suffers from a thin plot with a story which is filled with side characters who contribute little to the plot and a denouement which is predictable and too little too late. Don't expect to be seeing much of bit parters Hoffman, Ribisi, Portman, or Sutherland in this long wannabe epic which fared well with critics and public alike and garnered a respectable brace of awards.

The problem is too much license was taken from realism with the story. The sex sequences are absurd considering the historic era the film was staged in (the Civil War). Nicole Kidman isn't even given enough script to work with but there is no surprise with this considering the writers could not even get the history right.Anyone somewhat knowing of the era would consider some of the out door sequences to be absurd. Things are done which are totally out of context or totally out of sequence.The scenery is the films strong point, the rest of it is a pretty lame effort.

30,KineticSeoul,Cold romance,8,19 July 2013,Stories about two lovers being separated because of a certain dire situation has happened many times in books and movies. But this one is a cold and compelling story shown in a dark manner but still has heart and warmth to it. Despite the fact that the two main leads or lovers has to go through a lot of cold obstacles and temptations in order to meet one anther again. When they are separated because of the civil war. This is not a war movie but the journey of two lovers and the surroundings they must overcome to be with one another. The male lead is played by Jude Law who plays a character named Inman that is forced to fight for the confederates but don't believe in the cause. While Nicole Kidman is the female lead named Ada and comes from a well off family because of her father. But when her father passes away and she gets put in a dire situation she has to fend for herself. Until Ruby Thewes gets in her life and is my favorite character in this movie thanks to the script and a outstanding performance by Renée Zellweger. This movie has quite a cast and all the actors and actresses puts on some memorable performances even if some of them hardly has many scenes. This movie starts out kinda slow but as it progresses it becomes more and more compelling and a bit haunting because of the realistic and well told story direction. And because of the realism and the struggles of the two lovers to be with one another becomes strong to the point I felt they really earned it. And actually cared if they end up with one another or not. This movie is a bit depressing so it isn't one I would watch again. But movies like this really bring back the old school feel and is a good effort.8.2/10,Cold Mountain
31,sddavis63,"Both Pointless And Charmless, But It Does Have Renee Zellweger",2,5 April 2008,"Essentially, this movie could have chosen to move in one of two ways: either as a war movie, depicting the agony that the Civil War wrought upon the South and its citizens, or as a romance, depicting the agony of lovers separated by war and uncertain whether they'll ever see each other again. In the end, it tries to do both, with the emphasis being on the romance, and, in the end, I found neither part of the story - which seemed to me to jump around far too much, giving it an unfocused feel - either convincing or compelling. The challenges faced by the South are realistically portrayed, particularly with the emphasis on the ""Home Guard"" - a group of Southerners tasked with the job of searching down deserters and those sheltering them, and who, as the war approached its inevitable conclusion, chose to abuse their positions to satisfy their own desires rather than to fulfill their admittedly distasteful job. This part of the story was often brutal - perhaps realistically so - but it left me rather empty to be honest.As to the romance, it struck me as both forced and artificial. Neither Ada (Nicole Kidman) nor Inman (Jude Law) came across to me as star-crossed lovers, although I suppose that the point of the movie was that it was their love for each other that gave them hope, and the strength to get through their trials. Still, neither character really connected with me. The one character I did like was Ruby (Renee Zellweger) although, to be honest, it wasn't so much the character that appealed to me as it was Zellweger playing the character. Zellweger is a fine actress who seems to be able to take on any role in any type of movie and make it work. As to Law and Kidman, neither appealed to me. Law seemed flat, and Kidman, who is a very beautiful woman, nevertheless generally underwhelms me with her performances.For Zellweger's performance alone, 2/10",Cold Mountain

Unfortunately, it's also a world where the heroes, even when supposedly starving, have 21st century muscles, and the heroines all have 21st century teeth. More than that, they have 21st century values as well: I'm not saying that all southerners were slave-owning bigots, but the film establishes very early on where it's coming from, where the hero shows, in the very first scene, what was surely very unusual courtesy from a southerner to a black man, while shortly afterwards the heroine declares her happiness to be away from slaves, though without specifying the nature of her objection. Which means, of course, that the film offers no insights into how white people, viewed as having the highest moral character in their own community, could have fought a war ultimately for the purpose of the right to enslave others. Meanwhile, the various foes who stand in the path of a happy ending are all depicted as evil and venal, in contrast to the nobility and modernity of the sympathetic characters.

33,dromasca,what one would expect from a good Hollywood movie,8,18 September 2004,"'Cold Mountain' is a big studio epic, and a good one for a change. All elements of a successful creation of this kind are in place - a good historic theme, super-stars casting, good cinema (much was filmed in location in Romania) , and a message that is beyond the plot, and makes the film worth watching. The message is about the vanity of war, the conflict between love and man's brutality, the will of the human beings to love and survive despite the wish of their leaders to push them to war one against the other. It's an actual theme today as well, unfortunately.What the viewer gets is a good cinema treatment, a superb war scene at the beginning of the film setting the background and providing Law's character motivation for the rest of the movie, and very good acting from Renée Zellweger. I was slightly disappointed by Jude Law and Nicole Kidman. Each of them was good, but not at their best, and they never showed up the radiant chemistry of a true great love story as they should have. A full world of good supporting characters and solid cinematography re-create the world of the American civil war in a fresh way, despite the many other memorable film stories inspired by those times.

34,Cineanalyst,A Hill among Mountains,5,24 August 2004,"The romance is more complicated than that in ""The Birth of a Nation"", but not so much as in ""Gone with the Wind"". Expectations are rewarded. Slavery is mostly ignored, so there's supposedly no racism, either. A romance struggles against the vast setting of the American Civil War, but fate will reward the wait. Crosscutting between the lovers' situations was enough for me. The climax was the editing in the mollified sex scene. I must applaud any such sex scene for merely not being annoying. Additionally, it helps that the crosscutting is between Jude Law and Nicole Kidman.We don't expect Law or Kidman's characters to die, or anything, on any of their adventures, so we get the next best thing after surprise: encounters with many stars, including Donald Sutherland, Brendan Gleeson, Renée Zellweger, Philip Seymour Hoffmann, Giovanni Ribisi and Natalie Portman.

It begins with the Battle Of The Crater, which I have visited and find fascinating. It has Jude Law at what I felt was his peak.Unfortunately, the film is a mess...at least in the first third. It is, perhaps, the best example of the overuse of flashbacks that I have ever seen. It makes the plot confusing for the first third of the film. This film could have been done in normal progression, or with limited flashbacks, and it would have been much better. The director needs a lobotomy! Fortunately, once into the middle of the picture, the flashbacks end and it's a rather straight...but long...story (154 minutes). Honestly, the film could have been a 2 hour film without losing anything of substance.Jude Law is excellent here as the Confederate soldier who deserts the war after being seriously injured in the Battle Of The Crater. In my view, this is Law's best performance in film.Nicole Kidman...well, to be frank, I just don't connect with her acting. There were times here that I thought she was fairly good, but there were other times I found her performance shallow. Here she plays the young Charleston woman who moves to Cold Mountain and falls in love with Jude Law.There's been some criticism of Renée Zellweger's acting here as a young sorta backwoods-type woman who helps Nicole Kidman on her farm after her father (a minister) dies. In the first few scenes when Zellweger sort of storms onto the scene, I do think the performance was almost comic-bookish, but over time she seems to calm down and bring some depth to the character.Kathy Baker is excellent as an older woman of Cold Mountain who befriends Nicole Kidman. Her character pays dearly for her sons' going AWOL from the Confederate army.Brendan Gleeson is interesting as Zellweger's father.I was not impressed at all with Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance as an immoral minister.I enjoyed Donald Sutherland as a minister, although his role is short-lived.I watched this film twice, and had negative feelings about it both times.

Not to mention Nicole Kidman and an Oscar winning turn by Renee Zellweger. But it was on TV tonight and in the absence of anything else to watch, I gave it a go, and boy am I glad I did.Plot In A Paragraph: A wounded Confederate soldier named Inman (Law) who struggles on a perilous journey to get back home to Cold Mountain, to his sweetheart Ada (Kidman) the woman he left behind before going off to fight in the Civil War. Along the way, he meets a long line of interesting and colourful characters.Every actor I have listed gives a good if not great performance. Portman stands out in her small role, whilst Seymour Hoffman reminds us what a talent we have lost.Zellweger deservedly won the Oscar for her work here, Kidman may have been aggrieved that her work was over shadowed by her costar. As she too is superb, and was rightly nominated for a golden globe, but their was an academy award snub for some reason. For some reason I found the love scene with Law awkward to watch too. Weird. I didn't even find Jude Law as annoying as normal and he picked up an Oscar nomination.There are several problems with it, but not enough to ruin the movie. Definitely worth checking out.",Cold Mountain
40,sol-,My brief review of the film,7,8 December 2004,"A strongly acted and always interesting portrait of the hardships that came with the American Civil War, not only for soldiers but for those who did not fight too. The times are portrayed well, with sets and costumes that cannot be faulted. What can be flawed in the film however is the central romance, which is without much spark or realism. But all the action surrounding the romance is great, with some good-natured humorous touches, wonderful supporting characters and the perfect picture overall of life during the American Civil War. The cast is superb, with Zellweger in particular undergoing a superb transformation from her typical roles. The film is generally well written and well directed by Minghella, so that in spite of a lackluster romance, the film is still a captivating and entertaining watch.",Cold Mountain
41,briancham1994,Brutal epic,8,4 June 2020,"This film is an epic in its scale and tone. It covers the lives of many interesting, well-acted characters through the Civil War period and their stories are compelling. The tone is nihilistic and often brutal in its violence. My only complaint is that it's a bit too long and the pace peters out near the end.",Cold Mountain
42,helpless_dancer,Rebel with a cause: but he gave it up,8,21 February 2005,"Very enjoyable film about a southerner who gleefully goes off to battle only to find it wasn't the grand adventure he had envisioned. Sick of the carnage he takes the long road home, experiencing many rough knocks as he does. The picture bounces back and forth from 1861 to 1863 showing us the man before and after his soldiering experience. Primarily we see his relationship with a woman as it gets a rocky start and gradually forms into something permanent. Many fine performances in the movie made it memorable; I particularly liked the interplay between Ruby and Ada. I had to laugh a couple of times at Ruby's habit of counting off points she wanted to make. Hilarious. Well played out ending; fit in well with the mood preceding it.",Cold Mountain
43,funkyfry,"Underwhelming pseudo-""Gone With the Wind""",5,5 July 2005,"Not sure exactly what I was expecting with this film.... I went into it with a pretty open mind, but I was disappointed nonetheless. The story is just too flimsy to be believed, a very 19th-Century romantic story without much to back up the romance -- in fact more than once the main characters have to comment on how they had barely seen or spoken to each other, as if this makes up for the fact that their relationship is not established properly. I think the performances were generally good, if a bit over-sincere. Jude Law really made me feel for his character, and I was interested in his story as he trekked back to his love, though the episode with Portman fell flat for me, the sequences with Seymour-Hoffman made up for those. Zellwegger is great here, too, really appealing as the sort of tomboyish young woman who might actually have been found at that time in the South. One thing I also appreciated was that it gave a fairly balanced view of the average Southerner's take on the war.... in contrast to Hollywood's sometimes stereotyped approach. The battle sequences are excellent, but too short and falling only in the very early parts of the film. The big problem I had with the film was the unsubstantiated romance, along with some truly bad dialogue. It seems like the film-makers felt compelled to make a big statement on war when they really should have left their story a tragic romance and not tried to make it seem ""great"". The photography, however, is at times astounding, I particularly remember a shot of Law framed against a sunset early in the film that was quite beautiful.",Cold Mountain
44,dfranzen70,Turgid melodrama,4,24 August 2004,"Neither engrossing or compelling, Cold Mountain is a tale of a Confederate soldier (Jude Law) and his attempts to return home to his sweetheart (Nicole Kidman) in North Carolina.Since Inman (Law) has been gone for so long, Ada Monroe has taken over the management of her farm. But since the Civil War is underway, there aren't any handymen to be found who could help her with the day-to-day operations, so Ruby Thewes (Rene Zellweger), a rough-and-tumble tomboy who happens to have long, flowing blonde hair and wear a copious amount of lipstick, shows up to lend a hand and a barbed tongue.There are two story strands: Inman's travails as he desperately tries to get home (and labeled a deserter, at that) and Ada's difficulties as she alternately clears fields and pines for Inman. And pine she does! She can't live without him, it seems, and yet.. and yet somehow, she does. She puts off advances from other, opportunistic menfolk who are a-dyin' to get in her britches, all the while learning all kinds of Man Stuff, like firing a gun. O, will she survive? Will Inman make it home before his not-a-wife gives up and marries the cad from down the lane? I'm all a-twitter with my ruminations. Kidman and Law are well cast and do have some chemistry together (and Kidman's appropriately pale in complexion, since she's playing someone who's been sheltered most of her life, at least figuratively speaking). Zellweger, however, seems hilariously miscast. I know part of it is because her character's so broadly written, but her performance alternately made me chuckle and cringe, chuckle and cringe.It doesn't help that the movie's slowly paced and has at least two too many endings. Anthony Minghella directed, though, so that was to be expected.",Cold Mountain
45,meeza,Good view of Cold Mountain!,8,1 February 2004,"Almost every freeze frame of the epic `Cold Mountain' is encompassed with ravishing cinematography, an authentic art direction, and a heart-rending musical score. Those are definitely the hot properties of `Cold Mountain'. Jude Law stars as Inman, a Civil War soldier who is on an enduring journey to Cold Mountain to reunite with his love- Ada Monroe.  Ada is played by newcomer Nicole Kidman. Just a little kidman kidding!   Part of `Cold Mountain' revolves around the series of adventures that Inman is confronted with on his journey, which very much resembles `Homer's Odyssey'. The other side of the mountain focuses on Ada's desperation for her Inman to return, and the friendship she develops with the tough grassroots southern farmgirl Ruby- here played with dynamism by Renee Zellweger. Director Anthony Minghella continues to prove that he is mountains above many other directors as far as adapting epic literary works into major motion pictures. However, I must give the cold shoulder to the screenplay of  `Cold Mountain. It was a bit falsifying and way too melodramatic. Nevertheless, `Cold Mountain' is high enough with positive attributes for you to climb on to. **** Good",Cold Mountain
46,CubsandCulture,"Old Fashioned Romance, Powerful Allegory, and Sublime Craftsmanship",10,26 August 2018,"2003 was a great year for cinema and Cold Mountain towers over the the other offerings on every level. The surface layer of the film is a lush emotional romance about a a Southern Belle waiting for her Johnny Red to come back to her. Law and Kidman both are really good in their roles. Law especially gives a striking performance. I think the screenplay does a really good job handling the brief nature of the initial romantic scenes. And it is smart enough to have the characters acknowledge this aspect. It is like a updated version of Gone With The Wind.But below the surface the story is a combination of a Christian morality play around Charity and a reworking of the odyssey. What I mean is Inman symbolically dies at the beginning of the film, wonders around the afterlife, crosses the river Styx, all to get back to heaven (Cold Mountain) etc. All the various colorful characters he meets, played wonderfully by a great cast, track with both a Christian concept and something from Greek mythology. I.e. The Hillbilly family are the sirens and lust. Inman (INRI) has messiah imagery attached to him, at one point he is weighed down with the sins of others, and it all adds up to an extremely powerful allegory. This is most apparently in the Sara (Portman) sequence where Inman cannot offer to take her to Cold Mountain with him because she was, to say the least, uncharitable towards a union soldier. It is all emotionally gripping stuff.The cinematic craftsmanship of the film is top notch. The scope the colors in this film is extremely wide and the photography allows you to get lost in the story. The same is true for the other technical departments. The music is sublime.Two quick notes: Ruby is easily the most entertaining part of this film and at least Zellweger got recognized finally by the Oscars.Second: The film isn't about the civil war, the setting was selected mainly for its color and the practical aspects of a civil war (brother vs brother, friend/foe speak the same language) and because of Gone With the Wind. I don't have any idea how realistic the opening battle is but in terms of dealing with the Confederacy, despite not being really about that, this film treats it among the best I have ever seen. The Confederate cause isn't whitewashed, at least twice slavery was blatantly stated to be the confederate cause. More to the point, the home guard (allegorically the devil) is the primary source of antagonism in the film and that's the most visible part Confederacy. One can wonder if the using any war as a mere backdrop is OK for a film but here the film at least gets the main historical points across better than things like God and General.",Cold Mountain
47,Chris_Docker,Another triumph for Nicole Kidman,8,18 January 2004,"Another triumph for Nicole Kidman  in this one she plays the long suffering sweetheart of a man she knew for only moments (Jude Law) and who has gone off to fight in the Civil War. There are plenty of realistically bloody scenes tracing this troubled period of American history, but Cold Mountain is much more than a war film. Kidman is the daughter of a preacher  she can play piano and speak several languages but is poorly equipped to look after herself when times get hard. Zellwegger plays her down-to-earth companion and saving grace and as such is a revelation. Jude Law's character as a moral' soldier is an interesting one, as his long journey, physical and emotionally, against many difficulties. This epic tale tells not only of the torments of facing very alien scenarios unprepared, but of a love that spans several years of separation, based on next to nothing, and yet is the guiding light giving hope to the future. Kidman rises to the challenge and delivers another memorable performance. She is backed up by superb ensemble acting and fine storytelling, beautifully adapted to the screen.",Cold Mountain
48,sauravjoshi85,A Beautiful movie on Love between war,8,21 June 2021,"Cold Mountain is an epic period war romantic drama film written and directed by Late Anthony Minghella. It stars Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, Renée Zellweger, Eileen Atkins, Brendan Gleeson, Late Philip Seymour Hoffman, Natalie Portman, Jack White, Giovanni Ribisi, Donald Sutherland, and Ray Winstone.The movie is based on the life of a wounded soldier who embarks on a difficult journey to cold mountains to unite with his ladylove.I am a big fan of periodic war movies and had seen movies like Gladiator, Troy, The Patriot, 300 to name a few, all these movie had given me a satisfying feeling, same is the case of this movie although being a period war movie the war scenes are very minimal and the movie mostly covers the journey of Inman the character played by Jude Law who is on the journey to meet the love of his life.The plot of the movie which is based on the novel of the same name is interesting and the execution is superb, i have always mentioned that whenever you are working with a good number of talented people sometimes it becomes a task to use the talent of all the actor and actress to their fullest but in the case of this movie Minghella is been successful in getting the best out of everyone and almost all the characters will leave a mark on you be it Eileen Atkins, Natalie Portman or Giovanni Ribisi in their limited screen space or Jude Law, Nicole Kidman or Renée Zellweger who had got the most of the screen space.The acting in the movie is superb and almost all had done a tremendous job, in my opinion this might be the best performance by Jude Law, Nicole Kidman looked very beautiful, charming and effective, Renée Zellweger had also done a very much commendable job, Brendan Gleeson and Ray Winstone are the living legends and were equally effective.The screenplay of the movie is slow paced but is still very much effective, the movie will keep you engaged throughout and with the astonishing cinematography and mesmerizing music the slow screenplay won't bother you much. The climax of the movie is good but gets somewhat predictable.Overall this is one of the nicest movie to watch with beautiful locations, beautiful cinematography and equally beautiful acting, although the movie is a war movie you'll see very less war, although the movie is a romantic movie you'll see very limited romance, this movie is all about at what extent the person can go for his love and that's the beauty of this movie. Enjoy.",Cold Mountain
49,davispittman,"Film that addresses romance, friendship and the effects of war",8,1 August 2017,"Cold mountain is a film that addresses big issues like romance, friendship and the harsh effects of war. It shows these things in a very open and raw way. The film's best thing that it has going for it is the excellent performances by the A list cast. Nicole Kidman is an extremely talented actress and she turns in a great performance as Ada. Jude Law also stars as Ada's love interest, even though he rarely shares the screen with Kidman, the majority of the film focuses on them living apart longing to see one another again. And that journey to return to each other is really what makes the romance great here. We also have Renee Zellweger. This is the performance that earned her an academy award. Zellweger is wonderful here, she plays a very blunt, country girl that helps out Ada with the farm. The movie's best acted moments are by Zellweger. She truly makes the viewer feel the raw emotion in her performance. The script is very well written. I love how it isn't melodramatic but it still manages to create emotion. Seeing these characters and the tragic events they go through will make you care deeply for them. But it isn't just that they go through junk, it's how they survive and the connections they have in one another. That's really what Cold Mountain is all about. It's about connections with people and learning how to keep going. 8/10. I recommend this one!",Cold Mountain
50,slokes,Tough Climb,6,5 April 2007,"Some films are like sprints. ""Cold Mountain"" is a marathon. It pushes and pulls you a long way from point A to point Z, forcing you to bear witness to a lot of cruelty, devastation, and wildly variant plot lines, all in a sincere albeit misplaced effort to faithfully reproduce the Charles Frazier novel on screen. Oppressive, yes, but at least it's never dull.Inman (Jude Law) is a Confederate soldier, badly wounded, who decides to give up the Civil War and return to his North Carolina home, Cold Mountain. ""Come back to me is my request"" writes his lover, Ada (Nicole Kidman), and he obliges. While Inman meets a deviant preacher, a young war widow, and a kindly goatwoman en route, Ada keeps the house her father owned with the help of a female Huckleberry Finn named Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger).""Cold Mountain"" runs nearly two and a half hours, and you feel every minute of it. Because the film compresses everything so much, trying to fit all of Frazier's vision in, it never quite breathes in the way of another longer war epic such as ""Lawrence Of Arabia"" (an unfairly great film, yes, but those are the stakes ""Cold Mountain"" director Anthony Minghella plays for). While Ruby is running Ada through various farm chores, for example, she's also providing pertinent details on her character and motivation through talky exposition. Everyone in the film seems to have a monologue to deliver, crammed one after the other like air traffic over O'Hare.The other thing that makes ""Cold Mountain"" tough is its capacity for sadness. Sure bad things happen to good people, but seldom in so concentrated a form. This is also largely faithful to the book, but it should be pointed out that the novel uses its opportunity to better space out the ""war is hell"" theme. Also, certain characters suffer a worse fate in the movie than the novel (i.e. the Swanger family, the girl in the canoe, the war widow if you catch the extra scene on DVD). Usually films lighten up on a novel's content precisely because hard scenes one against the other alienate an audience, but Minghella trusts his audience to bear with him.I didn't exactly, but I did admire ""Cold Mountain"" for what it was, a stage for uniformly splendid acting and camera-work. Law nicely develops an understated tone as Inman, man of few words, while Kidman makes the romantic parts sing louder than they otherwise would and plays a good straight man to Zellweger, who gets most of the best lines and delivers them with gusto. The only great performance I saw was Brendan Gleeson as Stobrod, who really faked me out with his accent and with Zellweger co-stars in the best sequence in the film, when they meet again after a long separation.""He's so full of manure,"" Ruby says. ""We could stick 'em in the dirt and grow another just like 'em.""Minghella works in some great shots that keep you watching even as they don't lead anywhere, aided by an authentic-feeling musical score that feels at times almost devastating. In this way, ""Cold Mountain"" pushes in your face the fact the Civil War was fought by real people, not just played out in the quaint pages of a history book.I was reminded, with that music and Ada's voice-over letter readings, of Ken Burns' famous ""Civil War"" documentary. While not as inspiring or commanding as that, ""Cold Mountain"" retains the same aesthetic, and on that level succeeds more often than it does not. I just question anyone's ability to come to this movie without doing some serious homework, and when you do the homework, it may prove more interesting to you than the film itself.",Cold Mountain
51,Steffi_P,"""Having a thing, and the loss of it""",10,18 April 2012,"American cinema was once very much enamoured of the Civil War. The silent era produced the world's first blockbuster with Birth of a Nation. Then the classic era gave us its crowning achievement in Gone with the Wind. But since then Civil War pictures have been few and far between. That period has to some extent fallen out of favour as a cultural touchstone, and there has of course been widespread condemnation of the overt racism of the former movie and the general of-its-timeness of the latter. Now, with a more realistic approach towards the horrors of conflict and oddly enough a British rather than American production, we finally have another great Civil War epic for our times in Cold Mountain.Adapted from the popular novel by Charles Frazier, Cold Mountain is an epic that is made vast through its succinct storytelling. The background to the romance between Jude Law and Nicole Kidman is communicated to us with pure images and mere fragments of dialogue. The characters and where they came from is rarely stated overtly, and it seems more natural that way, as if we're watching life pass by before us. In keeping with this director Anthony Minghella (who also adapted the screenplay) often keeps his camera high and distant, although he's not afraid to put us right within the action at times, allowing the liveliness of a character's performance to push the camera away or their calmness to draw it in. His wide-open shots show off the landscape at its finest (Romania often standing in for North Carolina, but this doesn't matter; it looks wonderful), showing off the changeless beauty which surrounds the misery and bloodshed.The cast of Cold Mountain gives us some fine examples of non-American actors playing Americans, not that you would know for how well Nicole Kidman and Jude Law master the dialect. That lilting Southern States accent rarely sounds very serious to an outsider, but Jude Law manages to bring a strong dignity to the part of Inman. Irishman Brendan Gleeson is excellent as always, and his authentic fiddle-playing is a bonus. Best of the bona fide Americans is Renee Zellwegger. She's massively theatrical, but she gives us just the sort of larger-than-life supporting character the movie needs. She plays the role with life and likability, and she is deep and genuine when it's needed too.Cold Mountain is, above all things, a powerful romance. There's a sweeping, Odyssey feel to Inman's journey, and a burning idealism to the love story that some might regard as old-fashioned despite the movie's modern take upon warfare. And funnily enough those earlier movies – Birth of a Nation and Gone with the Wind – weren't overly romantic tales. Cold Mountain is, in a way, more achingly human; a beautiful picture, full of the balance between great evil and great kindness. It's a worthy and far less flawed successor to those Civil War epics of past generations, and it's a real shame it never got quite the reception it deserved.",Cold Mountain
52,dierregi,Depressing tale in frozen scenario,4,17 November 2006,"Much has been said about the implausibility of the romance between the Jude Law and the Nicole Kidman characters, but personally I do not find their idealistic passion unbelievable. Actually, the fact that they barely know each other adds to the credibility of their long-term, long-distance relationship. Love at first sight does occur, and mad passion usually burns in the early stages of a relationship, when one does not know the other well. Then you have mystery fueled by desire, hope and expectations.Therefore I do not object to Inman and Ada passion. What I object to, is the fact that Ada is quite too old to be taken seriously as a passionate virgin. When Kidman played this part she was 36, which is more the age for a mature spinster. Besides, Jude Law is five years younger than Kidman and it does show. Basically, I wonder why the part of Ada did not go to a younger actress. Kidman looks fantastic for her age and she is a beautiful woman, but this part called for a girl. Portman, who has a supporting role, would have been perfect for the lead.Another thing I object to is the artificiality of the whole set-up. This movie is corny sentimental while trying to sell itself as a great tragedy. Each situation is blatantly staged for maximum cheap thrills; from the opening battle, carefully shot so as to generate horror and disgust and to convey the idea that war is unreasonable, to the sadistic torturing and killing of Ada's neighbor family, to the obligatory sex scene between the two leads, artfully shot, so as to show parts of their tonic bodies floating in honey-colored light.Minghella is pressing hard to make us reach for the handkerchiefs, but his Ada is no Scarlet O'Hara, and the final result is gloomy and depressing rather than heartbreaking. The movie sits stills in its frozen scenario, the only warmth coming from Renee Zelwegger, who deservedly got an Oscar for her performance.",Cold Mountain

54,triple8,"breathtaking visuals,moving story but the film itself was tough to watch.",6,19 March 2006,"SPOILERS: Cold Mountain was a film I tried to see when it first played on the big screen but didn't manage to get to the theater. It's been playing on television lately so I sat down to watch. I didn't like it all that much even though it was very moving.The visuals, featured in this film, almost defy description. They were absolutely breathtaking, to the point where one could turn the sound down and just watch the film to let the photography envelop you. The landscapes were an absolute dream and the film was definitely moving.So WHY didn't I like this? Well first off, is the length. This is a very long movie and moves very very slowly so one really has to be in the right frame of mind when they sit down to watch it. Also, as anyone who knows the plot would know, it is a very sad picture and that element, coupled with the very long length, and slow pacing makes it rather difficult to enjoy.It is also very violent in many areas which again, most, who know the plot would know when sitting down to watch it, since it is about war.But there were other elements I had problems with. Nicole Kidman and Jude Law did not have any on screen chemistry, and, though Nicole Kidman is one of my favorite actresses working today, I felt she was miscast. She was supposed to be exhausted and despairing on a farm, yet her eye makeup never looked better. It was a bit tough to buy as at times she looked liked she was headed off to a modeling assignment.Some of the dialog seemed forced to me as well and the reunion between Law and Kidman lacked something as well. I'm an admirer of Cold Mountain because of it's beauty, poignancy and some of it's casting such as Zellweger as Ruby. But the movie won't go down as one of my favorites. My vote is 6 of 10.",Cold Mountain
55,rosscinema,Supporting roles save film,7,11 January 2004,"Even though this is one of the better looking films of the year its still a disappointment when you think of the main part of the story that involves the two main roles. Story is about a man named Inman (Jude Law) that lives in a small southern town called Cold Mountain and the Civil War is only days away from starting. Inman meets Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) who is the daughter of Reverend Monroe (Donald Sutherland) and once they lock eyes a flirtatious relationship begins. The two of them say almost nothing to each other but after war is declared and Inman is putting on his uniform he kisses Ada before he marches off. While at the front lines the Yankee Army dig tunnels and plant explosives underneath the Confederates and this is the start of a very bloody battle where countless lives are lost on both sides. Inman is wounded and while recovering in a makeshift medical facility he decides that he doesn't care about ""The Cause"" and deserts from the Army and plans on walking back to Cold Mountain and to Ada.*****SPOILER ALERT*****Back at Cold Mountain the Reverend Monroe dies and leaves Ada alone on the farm to tend for herself which she is not equipped to do. A local man named Teague (Ray Winstone) has his eyes on Ada's property and Ada herself and along with his band of thugs they execute Army deserters and torture and kill anyone that aids them. One of Ada's neighbors decides to get her help so one day the rough and tumble Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger) shows up and she helps her take care of the farm. During they're time together Ada and Ruby develop a strong friendship even though they appear to be total opposites. Ada keeps telling her that Inman will return one day even though she hasn't heard from him in years. While on the road Inman meets several people that either help him or try to arrest him and kill him. He meets a lecherous preacher named Veasey (Philip Seymour Hoffman), A grinning hillbilly (Giovanni Ribisi) with a house of sirens, an old woman named Maddy (Eileen Atkins) who lives in the forest with goats, and a young widow (Natalie Portman) who has a sick baby but yearns for the touch of another kind person. Both Ada and Inman spend the next 3 years or so going through all sorts of turmoil until Inman finally makes it back to Cold Mountain where they are united.This film was directed by Anthony Minghella who makes films in the most beautiful locations. This film is suppose to be in the South but is actually filmed in the lush forests of Romania and even though some of the scenes don't look like the South the scenery is still rich and gives the film a unique and remote look. The battle scene that takes place in the first part of the film is as barbaric as it is impressive. When the explosion goes off we actually see soldiers getting their uniforms blown off. Its a scene that film historians will be discussing at great lengths and its probably the best reason to view this film. With that, this film does have a glaring flaw that is evident from the first 10 minutes. Kidman and Law are practically strangers when he goes off to war and the supposedly love angle just doesn't come off. I wasn't sure why Kidman's character even gave Inman a second look. She's educated and proper and he's...well, he mumbles with nails in his mouth. Both Law and Kidman come off as strong but dull. What saves the film (For me, anyway) are the supporting performances that are all vividly shown and Zellweger steals the entire film. It's not that her performance is believable but it is impossible to take your eyes off her when she's with Kidman who stands around looking like a deer caught in the headlights. Zellweger's Ruby is a cross between Annie Oakley and Pippi Longstocking and she chews the scenery with gusto. While the story definitely has its share of flaws its still quite impressive looking and I believe this film is more about the journey than what its suppose to lead to. Minghella has shown once again that he knows how to tell stories on an epic scale and this is a well crafted film from start to finish.",Cold Mountain

But Inman needs to go to a war, and Ada, a city girl who moved to a farm recently, will wait for him. Ada needs the help of Ruby, a country girl, to make the farm function.

Cold Mountain was a yawning boredom almost all 3 hours. I waited for the famous Crater attack scene. It was shown. Not true, not as it was in reality. I wanted a Civil War movie and got a messed melodrama with very slow and poorly acting Nicole Kidman, very funny (the best there) Renee Z., and then, Jude Law. He was not good for his part. He was far too weak for that tremendously challenging character. So, even the parts of Donald Sutherland or Phillip Seymour Hoffman did not save this film from the abyss of boredom. Sometimes, it was OK, especially in battle or shoot-out scenes, but mostly - slow, deliberate and unnatural. There are many goofs, many historical inaccuracies for Civil War buffs' horror.

59,xredgarnetx,Great battle scenes,6,22 January 2007,"As with the French weeper, A LONG ENGAGEMENT, COLD MOUNTAIN is a war film within a romantic film, a chick flick with some pretty awesome battle scenes and satisfyingly bloody violence. Jude Law plays a southern farmhand who goes off to fight the Civil War, vowing to return to his true love, the aristocratic Nicole Kidman, who has recently moved with her ailing father (a bewigged Donald Sutherland) from the big city to the hills of North Carolina. While Nicole is waiting for Law to come home, she undergoes various trials and tribulations, as does Law. An almost unrecognizable Renee Zellweger plays Kidman's spunky right-hand woman, and Natalie Portman is a woman with child and no husband whom Law befriends on his arduous journey home. Jena Malone, Charlie Hunnam, Kathy Baker, Philip S. Hoffman, Ray Winstone, Cillian Murphy, Brendan Gleeson and Giovanni Ribisi play supporting roles. With all this star power, especially all the foreigners, I half-expected Keira Knightley to pop in. The thick southern accents are something to hear, if not always understand, and the many fight scenes are worth a look by all you unreconstructed males out there. I could have done without all the romantic folderol, but you can't have everything. Zellweger gives an Oscar-worthy performance. Come to think of it, she did win an Oscar for her role in this.",Cold Mountain
60,TheUnknown837-1,"Minghella's love story set in another gritty war plays well enough, unfortunately the romantic plot is the least interesting element of the picture",7,11 February 2010,"Watching ""Cold Mountain"" gave me the impression that its director, Anthony Minghella, was deliberately trying to outdo himself and the own film of his' that he was trying to beat was the virtually impeccable ""The English Patient"" from 1996. Comparing the two movies, the premise is quite similar. We have a passionate love affair between two people set in a turbulent time of war and they end up treating the war more or less as a disturbance in the background while trying to find themselves back in each other's arms again. The primary plot differences are that Nicole Kidman's character is not married, Jude Law's is a deserter, and the conflict is the American Civil War.""Cold Mountain"" is, story-wise, more watered down and mellow than say ""The English Patient"" and it's more on the level for people who want a simple love story with some kind of an exterior turbulence causing a problem. It is a shorter film, which is a plus for people with less patience. However, it's not as spectacular or original or genuinely gripping as ""The English Patient."" My *only* big complaint about ""Cold Mountain"" is, astonishingly, the love affair between the characters of Inman (Jude Law) and Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman). Amazingly, their love was the least interesting thing in the picture. They don't have a real relationship; we don't feel any real passion coming from them and the passion that we do see is more physical than emotional. I was more fascinated by the friendship between Nicole Kidman and Oscar-winner Renee Zellwegger and also Jude Law's travels across country dodging vigilantes and enemy soldiers. If Minghella had strengthened the importance of the love story, then he would have had, I feel, a better picture.Of course, the movie is entertaining even if the love story is uninteresting. The Civil War sequences are absolutely great; they are of the modern tradition that show war as horrible and dehumanizing. The re-enactment of the Petersburg campaign, in which tons of explosives was detonated from underground and then followed by a hand-to-hand battle is horrifying. Minghella does not shy from showing blood and gore in an artistic and sensible manner, and he's not afraid to show casualties of innocence and life in these scenes. There are moments where women as well as men are killed, oftentimes by crossfire. And there's more to it. Just the sound design of the movie generates tension. There's a scene where Inman and another deserter make themselves a meal by sawing off the head of a dead cow. We don't see the slicing, but the sound effects of blade going through bone are sickening.Lastly, I must congratulate the cast for the performances. Jude Law was terrific in the movie and deserved the Academy Award nomination he received. I feel that Nicole Kidman deserved one as well, even though her character was a bit shallow. Renee Zellwegger had the most personality and screen-stealing atmosphere. And then there's just the bit parts that also really work to complete this stylistic world recreating a horrible time in America's past.Maybe ""Cold Mountain"" would have been better as a war picture, but it most certainly would have been spectacular like ""The English Patient"" if its love story had been powered up and made more passionate by the screenwriters and director Anthony Minghella. As it is, it's a most enjoyable picture, I wasn't bored by it, and I recommend it. I just say that its love story - though a central plot point - is a little more mellow than it needs to be and all the stuff around it was what really worked.",Cold Mountain
61,mstomaso,Hope in Times of Despair,9,4 October 2007,"Anthony Minghela's (writer/director) Cold Mountain is a carefully constructed, sensitive, and intelligent drama set in the social context of the confederacy during the civil war. It deals with the politics of the war in a very subtle and realistic manner. While it accurately depicts the brutality and inhumanity of that war, it also does something that many films related to this period do not handle effectively - Cold Mountain studies the southern context from the inside out, and portrays changes among the non-slave owning common people wrought by the war. Almost uniquely, Cold Mountain does not over-generalize southerners, northerners or anybody else.The film surfs through genres as needed - never presenting a dull moment. It is a romance, a war story, an action-adventure and historical fiction, all nicely woven into one.The story centers on Inman (Jude Law) and Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), who are smitten with each other for very simple reasons. As this young romance begins to bud, Inman enlists in the confederate army, taking with him a book Ada has given him and a photograph of her. Ada's character is one of the most brilliant aspects of the film, which is important because the audience experiences this film from a third person perspective, but the story is clearly hers from the beginning to the end. Ada is an intelligent southern belle and daughter of a liberal minister. She begins the film as a daddy's girl skilled in many of the arts that southern women who have been surrounded by servants most of their lives were expected to learn. In other words, as she admits to Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger), she is a master of everything useless.Ada's father passes on, and she is left to manage his modest estate by herself. With no experience of this sort, she struggles, and survives by holding the memory of Inman close to her heart. Ruby enters the picture as a tough young woman who has been raised by a drunk and negligent father. Ruby has all the skills and abilities Ada lacks, and as they become inseparable business partners, they grow to love one another as best friends. Inman's experience is radically different, but something of a mirror image. During his participation in the war, he sees many friends killed for causes they don't really believe in, and decides to desert. Nobody he meets comes to his rescue as he begins the thousand mile walk back to Cold Mountain and Ada, and most of those he meets die.The bulk of the film takes place during Inman's long walk, following both of the protagonists as they live, learn, grow and change. An on-going act of will borne of desperation preserves their intense passionate love. For Inman, it is his only source of hope in a world of pure desperation. For Ada, it is very much the same thing, but also a symbol and remnant of the old south - a world which is rapidly passing.The cinematography is powerful and breathtaking. There are beautiful shots of Appalachian landscapes which give the film a strong sense of history. The script and editing are also extremely strong - emphasizing the broad class and educational differences reflected in the ante bellum southern dialects of the middle and lower classes. With the cast of this film, nothing short of perfection should be expected. And the cast, mostly, rises to the occasion. My one criticism, however, relates to the accents adopted by Kidman and Law's characters. An Australian and a Brit probably should not be expected to accurately reproduce southern American speech, but there are a few occasions where these two exceptionally gifted actors produce distracting vocal slips. I admit my oversensitivity to this, and can say with some confidence that it won't bother most people. Zellweger's performance is outstanding and she creates a character I will remember into my senescence.Very highly recommended.",Cold Mountain
62,sarastro7,"Good, but not an unmitigated success",7,31 January 2005,"I never bothered to see Cold Mountain in the theater, because the style and subject matter didn't off-hand appeal to me. Still, I felt I had to see it eventually, so I thought I'd give it a try now.It's a good movie, but I also understand why it has many negative reviews. It surely isn't very engaging, especially not in the beginning. I do think it gets better and better as it goes along, with a notable improvement as soon as Renee Zellweger appears. Natalie Portman was great, also.But although I think Nicole Kidman is absolutely beautiful in this movie, it does start off being rather dull. As it proceeds, however, one starts being caught up in the terrors of the civil war and the way the land was left largely without men, because the few ones left - even the old ones - would be shot by the patrolling deserter hunters. It was a momentary total breakdown of civilization. I don't know exactly how realistically this movie portrays the situation, but I assume it's very realistic indeed.The ending of the movie was bittersweet. I was quite annoyed that Inman managed to return only to get shot dead by the last ranger - it seemed to invalidate all the hardships he'd gone through on his quest back to Ada. But the final scenes, with their daughter, Ruby's father and husband and their children, and the beautiful music they played, actually managed to restore my faith in the beauty and continuity of life (in the context of the movie's story). It shouldn't all ride on single individuals; what really matters is that life, in a broader general sense, goes on. It is life itself that matters, and we are all part of it. Every individual is somehow present in every other individual, in every blade of grass, in the land itself. This beauty; this appreciation for all life, is greater than the love for a single person, because it spurs those who survive to live on. And this movie's ending actually manages to convey that. So the ending was very fulfilling to me after all.Still, the entertainment value of the movie wasn't great, which is why I will not rate it higher than a 7 out of 10.",Cold Mountain
63,vitaleralphlouis,"Seriously deficient history, poorly executed drama.",5,21 February 2007,"The film opens with a seriously flawed --- and boring --- portrayal of the explosion at Petersburg; an intensely interesting event in real history even if told briefly: A group of Pennsylvania miners suggested they use their mining ability to build a tunnel to right under the Confederate troops and set off a massive explosion. This was carried out successfully in the short-run, but in the immediate aftermath the Union troops were standing around watching their deadly handiwork but the Confederates reacted quickly with rage and shot down more Union troops, with the North thus taking the heavier casualties. The movie says nothing about this, preferring to focus on the rabbit being chased down by troops.The Siege at Petersburg is a part of the Civil War seldom told, seldom with honesty. Essentially a 10-month standoff, the South kept Grant's troops at bay even though Grant's army outnumbered the South by 12 to 1 and the North's troops were well armed and well fed while the South's were starving and ill equipped --- except for their tenacity and courage.Another review compares this film to Gone With the Wind. It's like comparing Burger King to Ruth's Chris. I've seen GWTW maybe 12 times over 50 years. Cold Mountain is impossible to watch a second time, as it lacks the dramatic interest of, say, a Tim Holt western.",Cold Mountain
64,DarthBill,Mountain Cold,4,11 January 2005,"The not so engaging story of two people who barely know each other falling in love and staying in love throughout the Civil War. The hero, Jude Law, spends the majority of the film trying to get back to his beloved, Nicole Kidman, who has to run the farm by herself after her pastor dad (Donald Sutherland) dies. The hapless Kidman is helped by a rugged Zellwegger and struggles to carry on in spite of the hardships and bullying of a greedy man (Ray Winstone, slumming it badly) who wants her lands and just happens to be the sheriff. Well, him and his thugs are later destroyed by Jude Law, but does Law live happily ever after? After the first ten minutes you probably won't care. Law gives his best but the film is just too bloated and sluggish to be engaging (and Law has noticeable trouble holding a Southern accent). Nicole Kidman is miscast as the hapless love interest; she's just too much of an authority figure to be convincing as a soft, delicate, helpless woman (plus she doesn't look roughed up enough when the hard times get underway). Zellwegger's heartiness borderlines being too comical for the film's own good.Scenery's beautiful though. That's New Zealand for you. Bad music at the end, I'm afraid.",Cold Mountain
65,tbills2,It Gets Very Cold High Up On Cold Mountain,7,20 July 2013,"Cold Mountain starts off as some sweeping, dramatic love story but soon settles into an unbecoming, whimsy mess of a movie, in a weird sorta way, but it completely strikes home. The movie begins by exhibiting a mood appropriately disparaging for a Civil War love tale, but it soon creates a strangely merry, airy atmosphere. It's fine or good either way. The plot is just as scattered as the movie is pieced together. There is largely lacking fluidity to the edited story. Although it has good action scenes, they are too ineffectively dark in contrast. More importantly worse, Cold Mountain has hardly any immersion. It detests and rejects you more than it entices and comforts you. I cannot care too much towards Jude Law's character as he makes his journey way back home, as he never ingratiates himself to the audience much in any way, other than being dashingly desirable as the love interest. The love story with Nicole Kidman and her character offers the closest thing to immersion, to getting lost in the story. Nicole Kidman is pure beauty. At this point in her life, Nicole has ascended into super beauty. She is, awe, her most gorgeous self. In a film that lives off its deep cast acting, Nicole in her lead's the best reason for watching, but Cold Mountain is not centered on Kidman's character enough. Cold Mountain is Kidman's movie. I'm certain Nicole Kidman gives the strongest acting performance of the three main stars, her, Zellweger, and Law, yet somehow Kidman was the only one that was not nominated of the three, and Renee even won! Zellweger gives an underwhelming performance, not even one of her best. Zellweger was far too exaggerated, talking and walking like some heehaw slack-jawed yokel, really ridiculous. How she won the Oscar, you tell me. She's just not a good an actress as Nicole is all. Her character, even though it's good in thought, is a big reason as to how the film winds up taking an unpleasant turn to the worse. Cold Mountain has near-great clips, but it's all throughout dressed up too unnatural. It's too divided between pained drama and gleeful amusement. I feel no chilling impact from Cold Mountain. I have to force myself to enjoy it. It's so, pointlessly underachieving. I do enjoy the movie for Kidman and Law's interacting, and that's about it. In retrospect, I was too critical in this review, but Cold Mountain sells itself as such an acclaimed movie and it's really not, so let me say, Cold Mountain is really, really good, very nicely romantically enchanting. There, is that good?",Cold Mountain

Mind you the movie is a success not because of, but despite, the two main leads.Both Jude Law and Ms.Kidman have trouble keeping their Southern accents in check;I for one was not persuaded that either gave convincing performances at all and because of that mis-casting the whole premise of the story that those two would fall in love at first sight is simply ludicrous. This film could have been a classic and for instance Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood would have made it so....don't say they are too old which would be Ageism.

At least a 7 and a half out of 10.",Cold Mountain
67,gregsrants,A good movie - not a great movie,8,30 December 2003,"I find it a little ironic that Cold Mountain took an English Director (Anthony Minghella), a British Actor (Jude Law), an Australian Actress (Nicole Kidman) and a supporting cast that primarily showcased a Canadian (Donald Sutherland) and an Irishman (Brendan Gleeson), to bring to the screen the best movie set during the American Civil War since 1989's Glory. Don't get me wrong, Renee Zellweger and Phillip Seymour Hoffman have probably the two most memorable roles within the movie's 155-minute frame, but it's the southerly-accent-challenged that get the most screen time. 
Cold Mountain is directed by Minghella (who has worked with Law and Hoffman before in The Talented Mr. Ripley), who worked from a script he adapted from the best selling novel by Charles Frazier.  The story surrounds a young woman named Ada Monrow (Kidman) who falls in love with the town handyman Inman (Law) right before the breakout of the American Civil War.  After a horrific battle with the Americans, Inman is injured and decides to dessert the army to travel back to his true love.  Back at the ranch (literally), Ada is finding the times hard.  Her father has died and Ada is unable to maintain the farm and garden.  Enter one Ruby Thewes (Zellweger) who hears of Ada's plight and attempts to show her how to cultivate the land and groom the animals in exchange for free room and board and the eating at the same table as the owner.Time goes on and the movie weaves between the lives of the two central characters.  Inman continues his odyssey back to Cold Mountain, evading those that hunt deserters and running into an eclectic bunch of characters that include a sexual promiscuous priest (Hoffman), a woman and a child left lonely by the war (Natalie Portman) and a hillbilly type character (Giovanni Ribisi) that lures Inman into his self-indulgent web.In contrast, Ada and Ruby continue to work the land and Ada soon becomes capable of sustaining the property on her own. We watch as they build fences together, grow crops and hunt for food.  They become friends and no sooner does Ruby confide in Ada of her abusive father, Stobrod (Gleeson) than he shows up caught in food trap on their property. Stobrod and his daughter begin to rekindle their loving relationship of old  But where would a movie be without a villain, and Cold Mountain has a few in a posse of men that are out to get back land once theirs and to rid themselves of undesirable deserters within their midst.  When the posse crosses paths with Stobrod and his band, Stobrod is killed and when Inman finally returns to the warm embrace of Ada, a gunfight ensues with nary a man standing its conclusion.Cold Mountain is one of those films that does everything an Oscar contender should.  It takes a bunch of good-looking, previously nominated stars puts them in a big budget war/drama/romance film with a love story that is multi-generational.  Minghella does his best with a multi-layered novel and brings to the screen characters that are both believable and enjoyable. But it is the relationship between Ada and Inman, or the lack of it, which is at the core of Cold Mountain's problems.  These two characters share but a kiss and rarely have any scenes together, so it is not very credible that they would pine for each other as they do throughout the film.   This suspension of belief alienates the audience from connecting with the two leads.  Everyone involved with the film is well cast (even and including Jena Malone as the Ferry Girl), but it is Renee Zellweger (who was a colored woman in the novel) stands head above the rest in her portrayal as the rough around the edges Rudy.  I heard one critic say that `Cold Mountain is a good film, not a great film', and I can't think of a better way to describe it.  The battle sequences you will admire in the trailer play a small part in the overall production so be prepared more for a dramatic romance rather than the fight for ones true love.  That said, Cold Mountain should do quite well come Oscar nomination time.  Kidman and Zellweger are Academy favorites and Minghella has won before with The English Patient.   In a year where the best films have all been about dark and dreary subject matters (21 Grams, Mystic River), Cold Mountain may stand above them all in late February with a bunch of non-anatomically correct statues in its hand.",Cold Mountain
68,Danusha_Goska,"War-Unleashed Sadism, and a Brilliant Jude Law",5,19 July 2007,"""Cold Mountain""'s leads are two of the most beautiful stars of all time: Nicole Kidman and Jude Law. In addition to being peacocks, their love lives are tabloid staples.It is set in the South during the Civil War, a time we inevitably associate with one of the epic romances of all time, ""Gone with the Wind."" Given the leads and the setting, not to mention the movie posters and the cover of the DVD box, you may come to this movie expecting an epic romance.What I'll remember from this movie, though, are the literally gut-churning scenes of war-unleashed sadism, carnage, and torture.I love Kathy Baker; she is an angelic presence in this film. And she is tortured on camera. It's a brief scene, but I wish I had never seen it.There's one scene of war atrocity after another: a beautiful and defenseless young mother menaced by Yankee soldiers who mean to rape her, steal her food, and murder her baby; a vicious albino (Albinos get such a bad rap; Hollywood should be ashamed) dancing on a board crushing a woman's neck, while her loved ones are shot in front of her eyes; soldiers blowing up other soldiers and then being trapped in the crater they created; a man attempting to murder the slave he impregnated.I'm willing to watch disturbing material if it comes together to educate me, move me, make me a better person...that didn't happen here. I was just cringing, holding my gut, waiting for the next unbearable scene.That's because ""Cold Mountain"" is episodic. Characters appear, speak high falutin', literary sounding monologues, and then disappear, often after being killed in some horribly diabolical way.These various characters' stories don't intertwine, or lead up to a climax where they all come together.You have to admire the very high production values of ""Cold Mountain."" It is beautiful to look at, but not in any new way. It's probably hard not to photograph snow covered mountains beautifully. I won't see snow covered mountains in a new way after watching ""Cold Mountain."" The cast is out of this world, and, in a way, that, combined with the film's episodicity and its off putting scenes of torture, took away from the film's impact, for me. Oh, look, there's Philip Seymour Hoffman! Oh, look, there's Natalie Portman! I half expected Charles Lane to make an appearance.I hope I can forget the torture scenes, and remember Jude Law's magnificent performance. He is just so, so good here: he is as believable as a taciturn, All American, homespun, working man of great integrity as Gary Cooper was as ""Sargeant York."" Law's performance deserves to have had a much more coherent movie around it.",Cold Mountain
69,rainking_es,The look of Nicole Kidman...,8,5 August 2004,"I didn't watch The English Patient, so I can't talk about it; but I did watch Talented Mr. Ripley and it seemed to me that Minghella  an elegant filmmaker, sober and perfectionist, and an excellent actors director. Now, Cold Mountain corroborates all those qualities. He's adapted to the big screen a classic love story set in USA's Civil War, where a refining girl (Nicole Kidman) has to  face up to poverty and to the absence of her beloved one (Jude Law), who's gone to fight in the War. The movie has two main lines: Kidman's character's evolution from a well educated and respectable girl to a farmer; and the oddyssey of Jude Law to come back to her from the battlefield.Ok, the story is nothing extraordinary, there're plenty of movies in the same line (starting by that icon called Gone With The Wind); but there's only one Anthony Minghella. He looks after every detail, he lavish care every sequence, every shot. Photography is just spectacular, and so are the locations. Wardrobe and soundtrack are just nice. Since Cold Mountain is based on a novel (just like Talented Ripley -and English Patient I guess-), the narrative style is rather literary, with a voice over and such well cared dialogues. Maybe Anthony Minghella's biggest defect is that he takes pleasure in every scene, in every view, in every look, and that makes his movies a little too long, and a little slow sometimes. He seems to be incapable of making a 90 minutes movie.
As for the cast, well, this is the very strong point of Cold Mountain. Nicole Kidman shines so bright, and she demonstrates that her talent seems to have no limits (maybe it's nothing to do with it, but since she divorced Tom Cruise she has incredible grown as an actress, so much so that she's become the best actress from his generation). Also her beauty is remarkable, she's more beautiful now than when she was 25 or 30. No doubt she's the most memorable thing in Cold Mountain. I'm not much of a Jude Law's fan, I think he's quite unexpressive, and without many registers, but maybe a more histrionic actor wouldn't have fit the character. I don't know much about american accents, but it seems to me that Mrs. Zellweger makes a good job imitating an accent that's not her natural one (and she takes charge of the funny points in CM -that's something she sure knows how to do-). There's also an impressive team of supporting actors: Donald Sutherland, Eileen Atkins, Brendan Gleeson, Natalie Portman, Giovanni Ribisi, Philip Seymour Hoffman ... a top quality cast. One of the best Hollywood pictures from 2003. A wise way of spending the money from the Studios.My rate: 8/10",Cold Mountain
70,jem132,"""Come back--come back to me""",8,20 December 2008,"I really enjoyed this Minghella epic, thought not quite so much as ""The English Patient"" (a modern-day classic). The first 20 minutes or so feel awkward, but as Inman (Jude Law) embarks on the journey back to his love Ava (Nicole Kidman), the film picks up in leaps and bounds and it becomes a very memorable, thoughtful romantic drama. Apparently it is fashionable to hate Kidman at the moment, but I don't agree at all, and she does well here. I actually think that the romance between Inman and Ada is weakly developed in the script (they really don;t get much screen time together to develop a relationship), but Law and Kidman give it their all and convince. Ada's journey is the crux of the film- she becomes a strong woman who can bear almost anything. Zellweger at first seems all wrong as Ruby, but she grows on you after all and sparkles in many of her later scenes. The film has beautiful photography and set design, but never really captures the true feel of a period piece. Jack White, in particular, has long straggly hair and a pale rocker's complexion that look completely out of place with the setting. Cillian Murphy fans will enjoying seeing the talented Irish actor in an early bit part, and Natalie Portman actually proves she can act in probably the film's most striking sequence. It's a pity that in ""The Other Boleyn Girl"" she's so inadequate.",Cold Mountain
71,jpschapira,Two Words: Anthony Minghella,8,24 September 2005,"I want to talk about Anthony Minghella, a British director, and his influence and impact on American cinema. He is one of the most awarded directors of our time, and has done films that will be classics years from now or already are (now I know that I must see ""The English Patient""). But personally, it took one screening of ""Cold Mountain"" so I could realize all his qualities as a director. First of all; perfect management of the actors. Jude Law is the finest example for this, if we explain that his two Oscar nominations as an actor were earned for his work in two of Minghella's pieces. Once in an interview, the director said: ""When I saw Jude Law, I didn't feel he was right for the role. I liked him, but he wasn't what I was looking for. But then, when I pictured Dickie, I couldn't imagine any face but his, so I called him"". And he was right, and Law's performance was great; so was Matt Damon's, and the portrayals of the whole cast. You'll never be disappointed in terms of cast when you watch an Anthony Minghella film. This is why the man has no problem in getting the best people on the industry, if only for a few minutes appearance. I'm surprised this cast didn't even get nominated for Best Ensemble in the SAG Awards. In the course of the story, we get to meet lots of wonderful characters, played sometimes for two minutes by names like Jena Malone, Cillian Murphy, Giovanni Ribisi; and larger parts by names like Natalie Portman, Kathy Baker, Donald Sutherland, Brendan Gleeson and Ray Winstone (are you reading these names?), where Gleeson clearly stands out. Continuing with actors, what I most enjoyed was when Law's character meets the great Phillip Seymour Hoffman's character, and Nicole Kidman's meets Renée Zellweger's respectively. I enjoyed it because it was amazing to see the scenes changing and watching stars of the caliber of Law and Kidman, each of them on their own, alongside the other two, not big stars, but actors I respect and like more watching on screen. I compared the talents because Hoffman is, well, a master in acting. And topic apart, Zellweger had made clear since ""Jerry Maguire"" that she urged for a deserved Oscar. Although she should have won it one or two years ago, her award for her portrayal of Ruby Thewes is more than well earned. A lot of power as always; in her words, in her looks, in her way of standingShe's so confident about what she does and that makes her perfect. At last! Then I can't forget the main stars. I don't really respect Nicole Kidman, but I pretend to accept her because she is considered an excellent actress by a ninety percent of the people. I can realize she changes a lot between performances. Changes everything, but forgets some very important details I will explain when I write about another of her movies; because her performance here is good, and helps the picture a lot. One thing I'll say; I keep on examining her beauty in all of her films, and I'll tell a friend of mine, again: She's not more beautiful than Katie Holmes. I didn't mention before, but I thought it was understood: this is Jude Law's best performance. Every part of his performance is understood too; this was a challenge (a big one) for the actor. I'd like to compare it with Adrien Brody's in ""The Pianist"". When a character suffers the changes these both characters suffer, it needs to be expressed by the actor. Brody, I've said before, seemed inexpressive in his film, with all the beard and hair in his ruined moment. With the same beard and a lot of hair, Law excels in showing he's ruined, this becomes noticeable in the way he introduces himself to people, the way he talks to them; and that's the strength and brilliance in Law's work here.From the way Law talks, we go to the screenplay, adapted by Mighella from a novel, as he did in some of his previous works. There are no hero intentions in this tale, no false words, no impossible love story. Everything is close to reality, which makes the piece a lot more powerful. In one scene, when an old lady is helping Inman (Law), she asks him: ""Why are you going to Cold Mountain?"", and he answers, almost crying: ""To find a womanAnd I barely even know her"". It's all very convincing; every moment. Going back to the main point; in the sceneries, the breathtaking war scenes and everything achieved by Minghella, show the committed director he is, and how he deserved and Oscar nod with this feature. He carried on a story that talks not just about love, but about several life aspects; and a very powerful work in every sense. With a constant melancholic tone, directed by Nicole Kidman's voice, that, even in the ending, talks about good positive things, but the music and the environment of the movie makes us think negative. I believe that's something terrifying but somehow fantastic at the same time.",Cold Mountain
72,gelman@attglobal.net,"If You Haven't Seen It, Don't",3,19 January 2004,"Cold Mountain is seriously over-rated and over-blown. It would be improved by losing an hour, and from this viewer's standpoint, by losing the entire 2-1/2 hours. It is s l o w, utterly predictable and irritating. Neither Nicole Kidman nor Jude Law make convincing Southerners and, though she won an Academy Award for her role, Renee Zellweger is less believable than either of them. For obvious reasons, Cold Mountain reminded me of Gone with the Wind, another Civil War story that seemed to this movie-goer to last longer than the war itself. Though the earlier movie belonged to the romantic fiction category and this one pretends to be more realistic, they are alike in seeking to capture (as does Tolstoy's War and Peace) history through the stories of fictional characters. Tolstoy, of course, produced a truly great novel which no film maker has yet brought successfully to the screen. In its time, Gone with the Wind was an extremely successful movie from a box office standpoint and won many awards which, in this reviewer's opinion, were totally undeserved. It was based on a very bad though quite popular novel. As a novel, Cold Mountain is better than Gone with the Wind though that isn't saying much. As a movie, it also won more awards than it deserved but it fell short of the success the makers hoped for and may have expected. Gone with the Wind is proof of the adage that no one ever went broke under-estimating the taste of the American people. Cold Mountain is less dramatic proof of the same adage. It didn't make its producers rich but it didn't exactly make them poor either. Crimes against art often pay very well.",Cold Mountain
73,Pedro_H,Basic human values laid bare - for those with the time and inclination to explore them.,8,8 November 2006,"A slightly narratively-divided tale of how America was torn apart by civil war using the device of two people (Inman and Ada) that want to be together despite all that has happened.This is a classic case of a movie which you can either get inside and consider a minor classic (as I do) or one that you get left outside of. In which case you may well use puns based on the word ""cold"". I think the IMDb reviews reflect that.What is amazing is that some of the serious UK press gave this a drubbing and the kind of ratings you would expect for X Men 13. If cinema is going to be a serious art form then it needs movies like this. Big money has been spent on what might be (crudely) called quality art-house with mainstream players.Not that it is perfect: Anthony Minghella has a tendency to spend a long time emoting and explaining when the actions and motives of the main players are already clear. War is hell and being on the losing side of a war is an even greater hell. Like Francis Ford Copolla - he tends to linger on a scene long after a point has been made or an action has occurred.America has never looked kindly at country people. It has a culture that is urban based and urban-basting. In cinema often a bunch of inbreed hillbillies that cannot be trusted. Growing food will never be hip and trendy and let's not pretend there is any chance of a makeover. The historical nature of this production doesn't change a thing.The concept of lovers torn apart (by war) is not new, nor is strong women that can cope on their own. There is plenty of cod drama here (fights, war, chase, capture, life-and-death struggles, etc.) but it has a proper setting. Tragic scenes are followed by happy scenes - because that is how life is and was.I thought all the main players were good. Nicole Kidman might have been a bit too pretty and made up at times and Renee Zellweger a bit over-the-top crude, but they worked well off each other. Jude Law has the kind of face (and hollow look) that the camera can focus on for long periods without him doing a lot. He is almost in another movie as he tries to fight his way home.Congratulations to Miramax for putting up so much money to make a risk piece - I hope you got your money back so you can invest it in more quality productions. Cinema that is worth the entrance money and that can send you away moved.",Cold Mountain
74,Ben_Cheshire,"The fatal flaw with the film, and why Nicole Kidman will lose her career if she's not careful.",5,14 July 2004,"Cold Mountain alternates between the stories of Nicole Kidman, waiting at home for her sweetheart to return from the civil war, and Jude Law, her sweetheart trying to find his way back to her. For conflict we have a rather nasty band of home guard who race around killing deserters... But Jude Law is a deserter... oh no! Run, Jude, run!Another period tragedy masquerading as romance adapted from a famous novel by Anthony Minghella. This time its a sweethearts separated by the civil war ""tell me a tale"" story. The plot is Mills and Boone / Midday Melodrama, but so exquisitely filmed with such an exquisite soundtrack that we hardly notice. It maintains a sombre tone throughout, and goes for tears almost non-stop.I've pinned down the fatal flaw with the film. I felt that Kidman and Law had zero chemistry: that the film worked, but when the two finally met up, it felt wrong, like they were two separate satellites, individually fine, but there was nothing between them. Its built into the structure of the movie. The two hardly know each other before he goes off to war: they kiss, she gives him a photo and speaks in a poor southern accent, and that's it. Then they spend the entire movie not sharing the screen. They have their completely separate story-lines: him at war, and then journeying back to her; her at home waiting for him. So by the time they finally meet, we have gotten to know them both as independent from each other - and somehow this fits. Which is why it seems wrong once they're together. And there's the fact that Kidman is an ICE QUEEN!She's becoming increasingly cold and distant - and looking more and more like Vivien Leigh. If she's not careful, she may just end up like Vivien. Her career is in danger of disappearing if she doesn't come back down to earth, experience the real world and real people again.For a female protagonist in this film we needed somebody who the audience could associate with, imprint themselves on - instead we have someone with only relevance to her insulated celluloid world than to us, the audience. She's like a porcelain doll: elegant, but nothing to do with reality.Zellweger is a definite scene-stealing highlight. A unique, vibrant character - almost a broad character, but not a 2D character.5/10. Everything about its look is 10/10 stuff. Superb cinematography, great performances from Jude Law, albeit iffy southern accents right the way through, and despite the fact that I did not like Kidman at all in this, I enjoyed it, but its flawed, to my mind, by the lack of a chemistry, and Nicole Kidman's unwelcoming, mannered persona.",Cold Mountain
75,manitobaman81,Good,7,5 September 2014,"I actually found myself watching it four times in a row. I probably could have watched it 24 hours straight, but I didn't want to ruin it right away, you know? In the waning days of the American Civil War, a wounded soldier embarks on a perilous journey back home to Cold Mountain, North Carolina to reunite with his sweetheart. So what do we get? We get sludge. You can tell that everybody in this movie knew that it was a stinker, so why try? Maybe the worst thing about this movie is that deep down, beneath the bad acting and the awful script, there were some okay ideas. Right from the opening scene I knew I wasn't going to be disappointed.",Cold Mountain
76,grahamsj3,Over-hyped,8,8 July 2004,"This film is NOTHING like the previews, which sucked me in believing I was going to see a war/romance flick. There's very little war in it. After 55+ years, I should learn to ignore previews! This film is mostly about an improbably sappy romance between Jude Law's character and Nicole Kidman's character. They barely know each other yet profess eternal love, etc. Law goes off to fight on the Confederate side of the Civil War, leaving poor Kidman to wait for him. Then Kidman's father, well portrayed by Donald Sutherland, dies, leaving poor Nicole all alone and unprepared to run the family farm. Law is seriously wounded, but in true hero fashion, DESERTS the army and begins the journey home to his squeeze. Meanwhile, Renee Zellweger's character shows up to help Nicole Kidman with the farm. The contrast between the two characters is very sharp and interesting. This film is OK but I sure would like to know what all the fuss was about. It's good, but not THAT good. I don't understand all the Academy Award nominations. I saw no glaring errors in the film and the historical part (that little bit of war that they showed) was pretty accurate with regards their treatment of the ""Battle of the Crater"". I gave this film a 6 and that's what it deserves. It is good but definitely not great.",Cold Mountain
77,esteban1747,Civil war aftermath,7,23 May 2004,"Any war brings disasters to any nation or territory. American civil war was not an exception of these calamities, and in my opinion, this is what the director Anthony Minghella wanted to emphasize in this drama starred by young Jude Law and backed by Nicole Kidman and always efficient Renée Zellweger. The plot is about the love of a young couple, W.P. Inman (Law) and Ada Monroe, (N. Kidman). The first one had to go to the civil war where he was able to fight effectively and even saved the lives of some of his fellows. War was finished and he escaped from the hospital where he was recovering himself. At this point he had to overcome several serious difficulties in his way back home, he made it and found a situation of abuse by a group of gangs in his site. The couple finally decided to marry and start a new life, but the gangs once again frustrated this desire. The film is a good combination of suffering and love.",Cold Mountain
78,artzau,Fine film,8,3 January 2004,"Many, many comments here.  Some good, many bad.  Zellweger steals the show. All the drama and intensity of this civil war odyssey aside wherein returning Odysseus too falls in the wasteland, Renee is simply wonderful. Her perkiness reminds me of an early Shirley Maclaine with the refreshing honesty and simplicity without dumbing it up.  Some fine contrasts between the social classes wherein Belles were raised to be Belles and farm girls were raised to be tough. The mindlessness and dehumanizing aspects of war are also clearly made, especially relevant in today's context [one hopes that this film will be shown at the White House...and understood there!]. Fine performances from Kidman and Jude, Hoffman and Sutherland...indeed, all give their best.  The corruption of the local Homeguard is often overlooked and it was a fine point to make.  The outstanding message seems to be that there was not a hell of a lot of romance in killing each other during the Civil War.  Hopefully, this message will be understood as being just as relevant today as it was then.",Cold Mountain
79,RJBurke1942,More like Dullsville.,3,28 October 2006,"This is probably my shortest ever review for any film.There is one spectacular battle at the start: grim, grimy and grueling and showing what war means: death all around. Technically well done, but nothing new. Quite a few war films in the last twenty years showed it equally well, or better: Apocalypse Now (1979), Platoon (1986), Full Metal Jacket (1987), The Thin Red Line (1998). Whew, even Gone With The Wind (1939) is a far better story.This movie is death to the senses, however, because it's what you can get when you mix genres: is it a love story during war or is it a war story that shows love is still possible? Either way, it's a dull, dull, dull story. The characters are dull, and the acting is dull. Which is all quite surprising from the late director of The English Patient (1996), a much superior film and story, in my opinion. Just proves, however, that you need a good story before you can make a good movie, especially when set during wartime. Cold Mountain, however, reminded me of the tedium of another war movie, Battle Cry (1955). And for a more credible love story set in war, see From Here To Eternity (1953)So, don't bother to see the rest of Cold Mountain after that first battle, unless you like long flashbacks, long interludes and voice-overs that serve merely to send you to sleep.In fact, I don't even recommend seeing it, even the first big battle. It's just not worth your time.",Cold Mountain
80,Dan1863Sickles,"Sumptuous, Sensual, Romantic -- It's Gone With The Wind All Over Again!",4,1 June 2004,"Wonderful, rousing story of true love with a tragic ending. Jude Law is haunting as Inman, the brooding, sexy mountain boy who gets pulled into the dying Confederacy's hopeless struggle. Nicole Kidman is luminous as Ada, the sheltered but courageous southern lady left behind on a dying farm, who learns to survive in the most trying circumstances. And Renee Zellweger is absolutely irresistible as Ruby, the poor white girl with the heart of gold who goes from scorning and teasing Ada to being her best friend and most loyal companion. It's very pleasant, this movie, as long as you don't look below the surface. If you love these characters enough as individuals, you can ignore the historical surroundings. Hollywood has been making this kind of movie ever since GONE WITH THE WIND. You know, the sufferings of the good and noble southern people during the Civil War. But black people are invisible. The idea that Ada is brave and plucky for learning how to pluck her own chickens is cute and sweet -- until you realize that for years black children went hungry so she could eat. No one wants to make a movie about that! Chris Rock tried to make some of these points at the Oscars a few years back, but Sean Penn (that well known liberal) shouted him down, showing his true colors once again as the classic playground bully. Why is it that Hollywood, the most liberal town in America, still wants to make movies like Gone With The Wind? They talk about how brave they are, (and I'm talking to you, George Clooney) defying racism in their talk and attitudes, but the movies they make reflect a very different reality. There's nothing in COLD MOUNTAIN to suggest that slavery was wrong, that blacks suffered, or that lovely young creatures like Ada and Inman have anything to apologize for. Wouldn't this story have worked just as well in Nazi Germany? Outside of Stalingrad, 1943, there is a noble German infantryman named Innmann. Of course he has never heard about the Fuhrer's plans for the Jews! But when his beloved Gretchen writes him that the family farm is failing he makes the pure, noble, humanistic decision to desert his comrades and head home at once. On he treks, nobly crossing five thousand miles of Russian steppes in the dead of winter, fighting it out with hateful, misguided Russian partisans who insist on trying to kill him. (They just don't understand.) Finally, on the outskirts of Berlin, he is gunned down just short of his goal by -- oh, the tragic irony! the literary brilliance! -- a callow, overzealous member of the Hitler Youth.A three hour movie about the sufferings of a Confederate soldier does not make it in my book. Inman got what he deserved. ""Those who deny freedom to others do not deserve it for themselves, and under a just God cannot long maintain it."" ABRAHAM LINCOLN",Cold Mountain
81,PersianPlaya408,A visually stunning film with a great score and solid performances,9,13 August 2005,"Minghella's cold mountain is a visually stunning and dramatically great film in adapting the famous Frazier novel. There are few films that one can say covered the task of adapting a novel into a screenplay and doing it well. I can say this about this film. The story is a bout a couple that is drawn apart because the man (Law) must go fight for the south in the civil war. The woman is left in ""Cold Mountain"" with no family and little friends. Nicole Kidman gives a solid performance as the woman while Jude Law was great as the man. THe film is well-acted for the most part. Most of the supporting actors are memorable in their short parts (especially Sutherland, P.S. Hoffman, and Giovani Ribisi). The film has a beautiful score and cinematography, the highlights for me. The story is good, although moving at a pretty slow pace, it is done well. Not one I can watch over and over, but enjoyed it a lot the first time",Cold Mountain
82,lawprof,Hollywood's Civil War Executed with Commanding Skill,8,1 January 2004,"Oscar nominations for ""Cold Mountain"" are assured. It's a sweeping micro-epic of the Civil War and it succeeds where other recent sprawling films about the great internecine conflict, ""Gods and Generals"" for example, fail. And the reason why it holds viewers' attention through two and a half hours is that it focuses on relationships - good, bad and homicidal - rather than on the great battles and still controversial generals from that conflict. Unlike ""Gettysburg"" and ""Gods and Generals"" we can all sit back in comfort and not debate or challenge whether Lee knew his business, a subject that prompts vigorous personal exchanges both North and South to this date. Based on Charles Frazier's outstanding novel of the same name ""Cold Mountain"" tracks Inman, Jude Law, a young, taciturn laborer falling in love with Ada, Nicole Kidman, as all in the small hilly North Carolina town await the act of secession that will lead to war.Australian-actress-of-any-accent-needed Kidman is marvelous as Ada who falls in love with Inman (no first name) before he joins his friends to march off to a jolly war guaranteed to be over in a short time. Inman, of course, has fallen for the preacher's blond and beautiful daughter. They exchange tintypes (an early form of photography). Donald Sutherland is the clergyman and he delivers an expectedly competent and familiar performance.Inman does not have, as the English might say, ""a good war."" He is present - up front and personal - when the Army of the Potomac launches one of the great disasters of its march on Richmond, the mining of Confederate lines before Petersburg. A curiosity: the slaughter of Union troops trapped in the Crater following the explosion is quite accurately depicted. But the troops sent in were largely black and inexperienced and here they're all white. Why so obvious a distortion of a horrific event? (Incidentally, the white brigadier general who commanded the black troops was hiding in his quarters behind the lines dead drunk while his men perished. Since the whole misbegotten, failed operation was an enormous embarrassment to generals Grant and Meade and the main Union casualties were just blacks, the drunk was quietly dismissed rather than being shot.)Inman survives a grievous wound and, barely recovered, he decides to check out of the Army of Northern Virginia and hike home. To Ada, of course.On his journey he has many adventures most of which could have been fatal. He meets and makes and loses friends. He meets and eludes or dispatches foes. Jude Law is a man with a grim determination that impresses and engrosses. His pain becomes the audience's. That's a compliment about how well he wears his role.Meanwhile, back at the farm, literally, Ada has taken in as a partner, not a servant, Ruby, played with insouciance bordering on the hopelessly comedic, by Renee Zellweger. There must be a reason why a large part of the audience broke out laughing when Ruby makes her first appearance in an unfolding set of scenes that has humor but also pathos.
All is not well in the environs of Cold Mountain where law and order seems to have been exclusively delegated to a small crew of Home Guard vigilantes whose cruelty and mindless killing polarizes the characters. There were vigilantes hunting Union sympathizers and Confederate deserters, especially at the tail end of the war, but this crew is off the charts. I don't think anyone in the theater liked them. I hope not. The actors are excellent in an expectedly stereotyped portrayal. Forget Manhattan, they won't be cheered in the Deep South. I think.A short but intensely emotional performance is Natalie Portman's as the Confederate widow, Sara, alone in her forest cabin with her little baby when first Inman and then a trio of Union soldiers arrive. Portman is believable and moving. She is Everywoman who is victimized by conflicts men fight and women and children pay for with if not their lives, their welfare.Curiously, except perhaps for Florida which fell to Union forces early in the conflict, North Carolina saw little actual combat (the one significant battle in that state, Bentonville, was near the end of the war). The privations that occupy much of the screen time were common as the war drew to its disastrous close for the rebels but in North Carolina things were largely better than elsewhere.Director and screenplay writer Anthony Minghella crafted a surprisingly taut drama given its length and the complexity of interactions by numerous characters. The cinematography is excellent-the movie was shot in Romania which, it's been reported, looks more like North Carolina in 1864 than any part of that state does today. I'm not sure if that's good for Romanians.General Sherman said that ""War is hell and you can not refine it."" Hollywood has grappled with the dilemma of capturing America's war that is still being fought over 140 years later. D.W. Griffith was the first prominent director to deal with the war and its issues and the celluloid avalanche hasn't stopped. ""Cold Mountain"" will achieve success throughout the country because it has truly terrible characters on both sides, avoids any real discussion of root issues such as slavery and shows kindness to slaves (Ada's willingness to go out in the rain to deliver cider to the slave quarters during a big party is almost enough to make one wonder what the fuss was all about). The war in ""Cold Mountain is brutal as it affects individuals and meaningless as a recounting of a conflict without comparison in our history. So general audience acceptance north and south of the Mason-Dixon Line (meaning box office receipts) is assured.But it is a very good, not a great movie, largely because of the intensity of Law's and Kidman's acting.

84,ThurstonHunger,lukewarmed over cold mountain,6,27 December 2003,"I read the book nearly four years ago. I very much enjoyed that and seem to recall it had much more interiority for Inman, whereas this film seemed focused on Ada/Ruby for character development. Jude Law was left to speak in silence too much of the time. He was longing embodied, though righteous (overly so at times).I almost wish they had given the narration of letters to Inman rather than Ada, it would have helped with his character as a deserter who has seen too much disaster. The interplay of Ada/Ruby seemed to work well-enough on its own.Also in the novel, the trek seemed more arduous, with more on the isolated survival of Inman. And I recall passages that felt quite poetic, that helped to distract me from the distinction what on film seemed to much like the good characters and the bad characters. Maybe more strife and chafing between Ada and Ruby would have helped? More dishonor for other deserters, as opposed to Inman??That said, this certainly makes fine use of the music cited in the text. And enough of the quirky encounters are decently recapped here. Seemed like an awful lot of close-ups, playing up the romance angle. The eventual sex scene was funny to me, as it seemed out of place with an edit of the two just laying in what I thought was post-coitus first and then into the beast with two backs and plenty  more wounds.Sex was not a problem for me, but a brutal beginning bugged some with me. Actually I recall the book being far more visceral, but reading pages of slaughter and amputation provides a better barrier of distance than on screen jump-cuts and gouges.This will win awards as a treacly epic when its really one of those not-so-bad, not-so-great films, I'd rather it had more of the arty starkness of Jim Jarmusch's ""Dead Man.""Who will make ""Blood Meridian"" into a film, one frets.

I thought I was going to like the film before I saw it, and well I was right. The film is good on many levels. The character study is great and there was really no bad acting besides a little cheesy romantic lines but thats about it. The large cast was great. There was some great scenes like the Civil War battle at Petersburg, the Union soldiers coming in the woman's house for food and for sex, or the return home for Inmann. The music was amazing like the piano playing, the Sting song, and the battle choir song. Overall, a good 2 hrs. 34 min film with a great casting choice by Anthony Minghella.

89,moviemanMA,Zellweger steals the show,7,21 July 2005,"Some movies has great acting that make the movie. This is a perfect example. Without Renee Zellweger giving an Oscar winning performance, this movie would not have been enjoyable. Her portrayal of Ruby Thewes, the tough talking farm girl who doesn't take nothing' from nobody. It was this character that saved the movie.The movie focuses on the journey taken by Inman (Jude Law) on his way back from the Civil War to find his lover Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman). On this journey he comes across some unsavory characters and has to tough it out to find his way back to Ada. Meanwhile, Ada must keep try and keep the farm with the help of Ruby. Ada doesn't know much about farming but since her father just passed away, she must make it or break it. Hiding two deserters from the war, one being Ruby's father, doesn't make things easier with the local law enforcement always keeping an eye out on the area for people hiding deserters.This movie isn't terrible, but it isn't unbelievable either. If it weren't for Zellweger's performance, the movie would not be even close to the caliber of greatness. It is a good watch with some thrills and entertaining portions. The journey that Inman embarks on isn't an easy one and does have its surprises. Overall Cold Mountain is worth a viewing but may not be the right choice to buy.

90,Flagrant-Baronessa,You know it's an epic when...,9,23 January 2007,"... it spans across 2½ hours, stars a wide-ranging montage of Hollywood stars, features unspeakably picturesque shots, evokes dramatic comparisons of 'Gone with the Wind Redux' and, more than anything, scored over seven Oscar nods with the Academy. 'Cold Mountain' boasts of all of the aforementioned accolades, although it is not usually hailed by critics or fans, possibly because this swelly dramatic Civial War set-up means treading down a road we've all been down before.Although there is perhaps not much novelty in Anthony Minghella's long epic, the end result is much better than it ought to be. Two things I feel compelled to put forth about this film: 1, how curiously low my expectations were seeing the underwhelming preview and a less-than-favourite cast of mine  only to be completely floored by a fantastic film and 2) how it is perhaps the only film I felt an urge to rewind and rewatch immediately after the end credits had started rolling. Now, I have many favourite films, but none have evoked this particular desire and as the cynic I am, I never thought I'd experience an overwhelming thing like that. This speaks volumes for me.The very core of 'Cold Mountain' is how absence makes the heart grow fonder. We see how awkward fleeting moments between the quiet, reserved Inman (Jude Law) and the rich preacher's daughter Ada (Nicole Kidman) turn into something quite profound and layered when the former is called to fight against the yankees in the Civil War. Through narrative letters, Ada communicates her longing and love for the soldier who finally decides to desert and head home to Cold Mountain to see her, not really knowing her but being swept away in the idea of his lover. While Inman embarks on a Homeric odyssey of varying degrees of humanity and desperation, Ada is at a loss as how to run a farm at home.You will be pressed to find a film that more strongly illustrates the dehumanizing effects of war on individuals and communities, even though it is a popular theme in movies. The difference between 'Cold Mountain' and heavy classics such as 'The Deep Hunter', 'Apocalypse Now' and more is that here we find a sweet core of love, and the story is infinitely brighter because of it. The screen is awash with dramatic lushly green hills, rivers, mountains and picturesque cottages and cabin logs filtered through almost unspeakably beautiful cinematography that fleets across the world with apt tracking shots. The costumework is equally impressive, capturing the bruised grace of the era as well as the gritty tragedies of war.As far as cast is concerned, I was skeptic to see Jude Law, Natalie Portman and Nicole Kidman in the same picture and expected polarised under- and over-acting. I was mostly wrong, for Nicole Kidman gives the best performance in her career as Ada Monroe with pure raw, intense emotional transparency. Jude Law, by contrast, is horribly wooden and botches through emotional scenes. Natalie Portman is not in the film for long, so there is no harm done. Every remaining actor is thankfully heartwrenching and apt in their respective roles, including a bold Renee Zellwegger as the unsinkakle hands-on-hips labourer who comes to help Ada with her decaying farm. She rightfully won an Academy Award for her performance.'Cold Mountain' is a perfect narrative with a brilliantly and patiently unfolding story, as is Minghella's style. Its only flaw, as I see it, is its inherently Oscar-baiting nature. But then again, it's a Hollywood epic about the civil war so it is presumably difficult not to fall into this trap. All I know is that it is so intense and touching that it fully trumps any film I have seen for the past months.9 out of 10",Cold Mountain
91,postmanwhoalwaysringstwice,"Visually stunning, but overlong",7,20 September 2006,"I never read the novel that ""Cold Mountain"" was based on, nor do I expect I ever will, but it seems that several elements must have arrived intact from the text.The film of ""Cold Mountain"" is a sweeping romantic epic, heavy on the epic and voice-over narration, and low on any real purpose. It's a flawed, but highly entertaining piece of work that leans heavily on it's terrific musical score, cinematography, and cast of supporting characters.With an unnecessary two and a half hour running time, ""Cold Mountain"" has plenty of time to present minor characters played by familiar faces. These minor characters combined with startling war scenes and intense torture scenes together create the most vivid picture of the South during the Civil War. Unfortunately the film feels weighed down by so much material.",Cold Mountain
92,PudgyPandaMan,A difficult movie to watch...,8,27 July 2008,"I am from NC and was intrigued when I first heard of this movie. First, because it was based on a novel by a first time author. How amazing to score such a huge first success on your rookie novel. It also interested me that much of the story is set in Cold Mountain, which is an area near Asheville, NC (only a few hours from here). The other item that got my attention is that part of the story is based on true accounts of a member of Charles Frasier's family that did desert during the war and walked many miles home.With all that said - I finally watched the movie not knowing much else what to expect. Needless to say, it has a horribly tragic ending. I'm not sure I saw that coming. There are some very raunchy scenes that rightly have this as an 'R' rating - notably the scene where the women trap Inman and his buddy and turn the deserters in. I also found the role of the corrupt preacher very offensive - but when does Hollywood every portray clergy in a positive light, so no surprise there.But the love story is very haunting and you can't help but be drawn into a love so strong that a man would go to the lengths he does to be reunited with Ada. Zellweger's performance deserves all the accolades she received.I think my final analysis is that the movie is a very raw depiction of human nature - both the worst and the best of it.",Cold Mountain
93,scottshak_111,Brilliant direction and great performance by the cast,7,8 March 2011,"Kudos to Jude Law and Nicole Kidman ( and how can I not mention the mouthy and boisterous Renée Zellweger). They were bloody brilliant in the movie. Albeit the story moulded itself in a predictable fashion, it was exceptionally well directed by Anthony Minghella. Love was what bound them together (Jude and Nicole), although the moments were brief and the talks were tacit, Nicole kept on waiting patiently for Law while he eagerly wanted to return for her. A great love story, I'd say, hardly possible in today's scenario. While we always want things to end up happily, the movie ends up with a sad note. While I watched the flick I had a premonition that something bad was going to happen eventually.Natalie Portman's role was brief although very well portrayed as a widow. Giovanni Ribisi and Philip Seymour Hoffman performed their part very well. Renée Zellweger surely deserved an Oscar for her performance. She was brilliant and fluent with her accent. Nicole Kidman was amazing in the flick. While the whole world crumbled upon her and the wicked self proclaimed sheriff Ray Winstone kept on coming at her house asking her to give up but she wouldn't. She kept on patiently waiting for Law to come back as he had promised her. The war had separated them and that war demanded every man from the Cold Mountain to show up while the crude Ray Winstone didn't allow anyone who absconded from the war to live as he hunted them down wherever he found a runner.Jude Law had to return for her. She had to wait for him. That is the basis of the entire story. It was a well written story by Charles Frazier with a brilliant screenplay by Anthony himself. A wonderful love story with marvellous dialogues and great acting by the actors in the flick. I would rate this movie a 7 on 10. Albeit the story went on in a predictable fashion it was brilliantly directed and well produced eventually. It managed to wet the cheeks of the viewers and that is what acting and directing is all about.",Cold Mountain

95,deanofrpps,An American Odysseus from Penelope's Perspective,9,13 July 2005,"I hesitated to see Cold Mountain. I figured it for a heroic tragedy from an officially sanctioned Southron viewpoint in the vein of Gone With the Wind. But to my pleasant surprise Cold Mountain was very different anti-heroic and anti-war to the point that I'm surprised top see that the Bush administration allowed it in the theatres. Perhaps Cheney left no instructions.Cold Wind is an ant's eye view of the Civil War's impact on the Carolina Highlanders, an everyday in the life of story of the frightening last days of the Confederacy. The Highland lads have been dragged off to fight for slaves they did not have. Many included Inman (Jude Law) have become disillusioned and have deserted the Lost Cause. Rebel officialdom has branded them traitors and ordered them hunted down and shot or returned to the crumbling front lines breaking under the pressure of Yankee raiders.Back home genteel Ada (Nicole Kidman) sits on her front porch reading books as she pines away awaiting Inman's return and as the farm goes to seed. Wooed by an offensive, murderous member of the home guard, Ada is content to live off the generosity of neighbors who have little to spare. There is only hope for Inman's return; no word has been heard; postal service has deteriorated from sporadic to non-existent. Outside of die-hards in the Home-Guard freed from service at the front, most locals are praying for the cause to be lost and the end of the war.Enter roughneck Ruby (Eileen Aikens) who forces Ada off her pedestal into the real world of living off the sweat of the brow and brings the farm back to productivity. Ruby came from a family dysfunctional even for its times and despite her hatred of her Pa, she saves him from capture by the Home Guard. Ruby says of the men who planned the war being lost that ""They go out into a thunderstorm; stand there till they're drenched and all they can say is 'Sh - - it's raining.'""Inman's Homeward Odyssey is laden with traps: sirens, the home guard and yankee raiders.Will Ada and Inman survive the tempest?

The result would have been the same if it had been an adaptation of ""Uncle Tom's Cabin"" in the hands of those filmmakers. Just like the benighted citizens of Ancient Rome amused themselves by watching human beings dismembered for their enjoyment in the arena while the rest of the world burned in a conflagration they had started but didn't know how to stop, today's Americans love nothing more (apparently) than to collectively cuddle up to tales of squalor, gratuitous blood spilling, dehumanized killing, torture and various acts of degradation and wanton barbarity. What distinguishes this little effort from the mainstream snuff porn you can rent at your local sex shop is that the values of womanhood, motherhood and vaginahood are raised on a pedestal on an equal footing with apple pie while all men (i.e. walking phalluses) are portrayed as anti-feminist pigs. For two and a half hours, the spectator is kept in perpetual suspense as to how his/her gag reflex is going to be stimulated next. This passes for art in the United States these days.

Given I only understand this is based on Charles Frazier's novel about the final days of the Civil War and that is it.It's the final days of the Civil War. Inman (Jude Law), being wounded from the war, slowly made his way home to Cold Mountain to be together with his sweetheart Ada (Nicole Kidman) once more. Along the way he had to overcome various obstacles as he had learnt that those soldiers who had escaped will have to be brought back to be on the battlefront once more. Something definitely not all those who had escaped wanted.Also at the same time, Ada is trying to keep her faith that Inman is still alive and well. She even got a helper for the house and it's in the form of gutsy Ruby (Renee Zellweger).I was almost horrified looking at the war how some of the soldiers treated the ordinary folk. Looking at how Ada and Ruby are like, they cannot be more different from each other. Maybe Renee's convincing portrayal of Ruby was the reason why she won at the Golden Globes and the Oscars as well.Maybe for someone like me who may not understand the historical aspects of the Civil War, but then maybe at least the love story part kind of won me over.",Cold Mountain

The movie is the life journey of Inman returning home to the woman he loves, played by the extremely young looking and talented, Judy Law (The Talented Mr. Ripley, Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil). I paralleled his return to `Ada' played by Nicole Kidman (The Hours, The Others ) as most people's life.  Inman's life journey is told in a fashion of a person returning home, in a sense like we all are, in a journey back to the unknown, and to the woman he loves. His life's journey is full of struggles and temptations, but more than anything a very humbly experience. He becomes a deserter and is very much persecuted because of it. Now comes Renee Zellweger as `Ruby Thewes' (`One True Thing,' `Bridget Jones Diary' and the much anticipated, `Bridget Jones: The Edge of Reason.'

101,dimplet,Titanic meets the Beverly Hillbillies,4,25 May 2011,"First the good: Jude Law delivers a first-rate performance. Renée Zellweger overdoes it at first, but given the growth of her character, this can be forgiven. Nicole Kidman is Nicole Kidman. But beyond that, the characters lack depth. Except for Kidman's father, Donald Sutherland, all of the men are either sadists or hillbilly simpletons. And even Sutherland's character comes off as being a rather simple-minded preacher, who doesn't have the decency to provide for Kidman after he is gone. So, ladies, all men are oafs, at best, except for that one ideal man of your dreams, in this case Inman, who is easily manipulated by a pretty, scheming woman. Kidman (Ada) and Inman meet after Maddy suggests Ada could bat her eyes and get him to clear her field. They meet, and next we see Inman clearing the field. So, naturally, Ada falls in love with such a malleable man. This is romance? And all the women are good, caring, honest, hard working, and detest the violence of war. Except for the hillbilly family, in which case they are drunken whores. All hillbillies are stupid and have bad manners, and almost all Southerners who live outside the city are hillbillies, with poor hygiene (contrasted with Kidman, who always looks like she is fresh from a cosmetics ad shoot). But Zellweger is a hillbilly who is not a complete moron -- she can count to 20 and spell ""catastrophe""! She is the most interesting person in the film, but, sadly, she, too, is the victim of stereotype and exaggeration. In Cold Mountain, we've got cartoonish caricatures masquerading as people, much like The Beverly Hillbillies. And, like Titanic, we've got a black and white world of either very good, saintly people -- the women plus Inman -- or very evil, sadistic, stupid people -- the men.Plus, we've got the all-too-brief romantic love affair that is too perfect to ever survive on Earth, just like Titanic. So, it sounds like a formula for a chick flick.Except, we've got unnecessarily graphic and gruesome violence, including animals being killed on camera. This is normally not allowed in American movies. The only other time I can recall this sort of thing is in British movies, and Anthony Minghella is a British director, so perhaps he thinks is all right to linger over the slaughter of a goat, as though it is art. It is not. The way Minghella treats people is far worse, and sometimes almost laughable. Like three Yankee soldiers who threaten to kill a baby if her mother doesn't tell them where her pig is. Yeah, war is heck and there was plenty of looting, but this defies credibility. And those home guard sadists are also beyond credibility, especially that blonde acrobatic sadist. The movie would have you believe these were the last men left in town and so the women were helpless. In North Carolina, especially along the Blue Ridge, there was less sympathy for slavery, and not every male was of draft age. Plus, in the South you could pay $300 and not have to fight. As to slavery, the cause of the war, we do not see any actual slaves working or even talking, beyond one slave helping the Confederate army, who is treated so politely by Southerners you would think he was the town banker! Yeah, right. Anthony Minghella resorts to time shifting in the beginning of the film, from present to future, and back to the past. It is interesting for a little while, but once you set up the film, enough is enough. This goes on for about a half hour, which is so lacking in momentum it is sorely tempting to time shift to a baseball game. When I see this I begin to suspect the plot is too weak to survive a linear unfolding. In this case, we have boy meets girl, boy is separated from girl, boy overcomes insurmountable odds to return to girl. So the plot is a bit thin. But it is not as paper thin as ""An English Patient,"" which, once you straighten out the story line, doesn't actually have a story line.For the rest of the movie we have to endure cuts between Inman's Homeric odyssey of endless trials and tribulations on a 250 mile trek home, and Kidman's penniless struggle for survival. Talk about an exhausting movie! Kidman's is the more interesting side; the story of the three women banding together to endure the war is by far the most interesting part of the picture, but, sadly, is marred by absurd exaggeration, including the near lynching of Maddy by the home guard. The extreme sadism reminds me of another foreign-created American ""historical"" movie, ""The Patriot."" Like Titanic, there is a gratuitous graphic love scene that does not live up to the build up. Half-clothed, half-porn, all awkward, it seems to be there for the teenage girls, just like Titanic. Inman is in (Ada). We see the climax, and the result is a posthumous girl. Leaving it to the viewer's imagination would have been far more effective. The cinematography is beautiful, though it would have been more beautiful if it had actually been filmed in the Blue Ridge Mountains, and the recreation of this historical epoch is thorough enough, like Titanic, that you assume the rest of the movie is historically accurate. But like Titanic, the people do not ring true. Minghella's instincts may have proved true to the extent that foreigners would love a film that portrays most Americans, North and South, as stupid sadists. To foreigners, this film, sadly, might seem totally realistic. (Kaori Shoji, writing in The Japan Times, was one of the few reviewers to see through this movie's stereotypes.) It is not. Cold Mountain is no more realistic than a comic book.",Cold Mountain

Were it not for that miraculous invention called a DVD, I think I would've put my head through the monitor, I was so bored!I closely watched Kidman and Law when they meet because their characters are supposedly ""destined"" for each other. Yet Law's face showed anything but dumb-struck love, while Kidman seemed to be counting the seconds until she could run back to her trailer! Zellweger's character is pure Granny Clampett (as if we don't get it, cornball banjos mark her every entrance), and so over the top, it was all I could do not to laugh! Ironically, her performance serves to highlight just how stiff-as-a-board the leads are.Ada nearly starves because she freed her slaves; we never learn why. More perplexing is why didn't any of them stay on as Ada and her father were unusually benevolent, and (as shown in one scene) it was a very dangerous time for Negroes (as they're politely called here). Why didn't the neighbors teach her how to milk a cow or grow a crop? Heck, why didn't she just sell the farm and go home? And for all of Ruby's practicality, when she dispatches Ada's ""evil"" rooster, that kind of puts the kibosh on them having any more chickens!By the time her beloved finally returns, Ada doesn't need him or anyone else -- which is the big joke! Indeed, she may be physically intimate with Inman, but her real intimacy is with Ruby, who has turned Ada into an Über-Babe version of herself. Did anyone else notice how they walked down the hill holding hands, happy as two peas in a pod, as they left Inman behind?I doubt that Minghella recognized this as he was too busy making an anti-Bush movie. Inman tells us he is ""like every fool sent out to fight with a flag and a lie"", and Ada's father says ""I imagine God is weary of being called down on both sides of an argument"". These ""observations"" are historically inaccurate and insulting. While slavery was the basis of the South's economy, the reasons for the War were more complex. It was incomprehensible for a soldier to think that the cause was ""a lie"" (in fact, most in the rank-and-file were indifferent to it). For filmmakers to stamp their views onto a period where such views were foreign to those who lived in that time is beyond obnoxious.Structurally, the film is choppy and episodic. Law and Kidman are miscast, and have zero chemistry! The script is little more than half-baked dialog, and an egregious bunch of clichés and banalities. ""Small moments like a bag of diamonds?""

The epic historical/love story, the score, the cinematography, the broad and unique cast of characters, and wonderful performances all-around made for a very impactful film experience for me. It's not that I didn't like Nicole Kidman, it's just that prior to her work here I always thought of her as overpraised. That all changed with her performance here. It wasn't only the delivery of her lines but she also brought an intense, genuine, and robust physicality to the character that blazed with power and intensity. Jude Law and Renee Zellweger played opposite characters, one barely spoke at all (Law) and the other wouldn't stop talking (Zellweger), but both were just right here. The score, which was a combination of newly written music along with traditional American folk music and was very emotive and greatly enhanced the story.

And to start with the complete movie I say a very nicely written screenplay and some very fine performances that I had recently seen. There were some moments in the starting when I felt sleepy but as the story progressed it started to show that it is a promising film. A girl saw a boy and both felt in love secretly with each. This might not be a new formula but was well made into a completely nice movie. The girl has to wait for the boy to return from the war. How the relationship got so close is the only part where something more had to be explored but nevertheless after that the movie picked up its pace and didn't made me feel like a time waste. Jude law is always good no doubt but I had never seen Nicole kidman performing so nicely. A completely new side had been explored in the movie regarding what a girl would do when she is waiting for someone in a war time. Many movies related to war been made and there are only a few who touch a completely different aspect and this movie made me remember of The Pianist. The things going on in the girl's life while waiting for her man were good. Another aspect was a number of twists at all times. The way they pictured the difficulties on his way home were very nice.

Now I know what all the hoorays are about; Nicole Kidman was terrific as well as her leading man Jude Law, and what a strange love affair they did have.  But the one who stole the show was Renee Zellweger.  In fact it took me half an hour to realize who the actress was; playing a distinctly different role, that of a strong self-willed southern gal, she stole the show as well as my heart.  If anyone gets an award, Renee Zellweger should definitely be that one to get it.  The war scenes are brutal and bloodthirsty, but they do not take long, thankfully, and the rest of the two and a half hour show is definitely a must see.

109,ilovedolby,"Many great filmmaking qualities, but the melodrama of it's love story is annoying!",9,28 December 2003,"`Cold Mountain' is one of those tragic love stories that director Anthony Minghella loves, like his Oscar winning film, `The English Patient.' However, unlike `The English Patient,' one does not feel swept away in the grandeur of the love story. `Cold Mountain' plays out like an overemotional romance novel turned film. Still, I cannot deny that the film has many great filmmaking qualities that to down it would be unfair. This movie is marvelous for its cinematography, direction, performances, and musical score. The film is based on the book by Charles Frazier. 	`Cold Mountain' opens with a stunning battle scene during the Civil War in which one of the characters, Inman (Jude Law) is wounded. While in hospital, he is read a letter from his lover, Ada (Nicole Kidman), back home in Cold Moutain by a nurse. Ada's final comment was `come back to me,' so he deserts the Confederate Army and begins his trek home. On the way, he is troubled by the memories he has of Ada, as they have only met on a few occasions but have become infatuated with each other. The same is true for Ada-she is so consumed with grief that she spends more time writing him letters and pining over him than she does taking care of her farm. On the way home, Inman meets many colorful characters that give him aid, or slow him down. One of which was Reverend Veasey (Philip Seymour Hoffman) whose piety and bad habits do not mix. As for Ada, a young woman named Ruby (Renee Zellweger) approaches her. Ruby has a cocky attitude and hardy nature that bring about some of the film's more whimsical moments. She wants nothing more from Ada than a home and food. The two agree and get the farm back in order. But there are problems in Cold Mountain-the sheriff is on a mission to kill anyone who may harbor deserters of the Confederacy. Ada, Ruby, and Inman will have to face the righteousness of the law before all is said and done. I was not impressed by Reverend Veasey's character, regardless of Hoffman's excellent performance. He added distaste to the film when at that point it was based on noble characters. However, Inman also met two other women during his travels. One of them was named Sara (Natalie Portman), a woman whose husband had died and she was now alone to fend for herself and her newborn son. Portman portrays her grief so effectively that it pulls at the audience's heart. Especially during a scene when she asks Inman to sleep in her bed with her so she will not be alone. Nothing sexual occurs, but it was a nice touch to give this woman something to feel after she had been alone for so long. Another interesting character that Inman meets is an elderly woman named Maddy (Eileen Atkins) who looks after him-she lives in the woods, in a shack and raises goats. She provides Inman with medicine and food for his journey. What's more, she also provides understanding of Inman's heartache for his beloved. `Cold Mountain's' one weakness is its melodrama-it becomes irritating at times and one cannot help but want it to end. In one scene, Ada and Inman confess their love and want to get married by saying `I'll marry you' three times, as they do in some strange land unknown to them. Give me a break! It is a good thing that the film can fall back on so much filmmaking majesty as opposed to its overbearing love story. ***1/2",Cold Mountain

Nicole Kidman, Jude Law and Renee Zellwigger were simply wonderful in the movie. The scenery and largeness of the movie was also superb.  We would recommend it to all.

111,axlrhodes,A solid tale of love and survival with some questionable casting choices.,7,22 July 2012,"Based on a book by Charles Frazier and adapted for the screen by Anthony Minghella, Cold Mountain is a broad, ambitious love story set against a backdrop of the American civil war (1861–1865). It has a cast that you imagine being assembled at Cannes, as almost every character we encounter on the journey (all 148mins of it) is instantly recognisable, and therein lies my beef. For any period piece brimming with big names, there's an inherent distraction from the material when each time we're introduced to a new Hollywood star. I found myself holding my breath as to whether he or she had the ability to adapt to the landscape of the time with an authentic southern accent. What's worse is when my fears are realised and actors like Ray Winstone, Jude Law and Nicole Kidman allow their accents to slip resulting in a character/audience detatchment that need never have been there. I understand the box office benefits to having star names dotted all over your poster, but in this case, a few more indigenous folks wouldn't have gone amiss. Casting issues aside, the film looks beautiful. Clearly, this is an ambitious piece and fittingly the cinematography is epic and sprawling. There's striking visual metaphors too. Apart from in the opening scenes, we see very little of the actual conflicts, although what we do see is brutal and bloody. Instead of witnessing soldiers dying, we see the crops on the farms and the unattended fields going to waste amid the absence of farmers to tend to them. It's symbolic of a country that was tearing itself apart from the inside. Essentially though, this is personal love story, but within that it's also a survival tale and the film stands and falls on buying into that love. I'm pleased to say that i felt it worked. Casting issues aside, such is the weight of what's happening in the background coupled with the obstacles our couple have to overcome to try to be together, that it's hard to deny some sort of emotional investment. That said, the initial set-up of the relationship, crucial to understanding and believing in the central love, could have been more played upon. Nicole Kidman is a fine actress yet here she lacks a sense of warmth. The times she shares the screen with a lively Renée Zellweger, she almost fades into the scenery. Additionally, Natalie Portman, in a brief role, brings real humanity and weight to proceedings leaving Kidman, the main star playing very much third fiddle. I'd have to say that although Cold Mountain is long and flawed, the backdrop events really help carry the film through some odd casting choices to help it become a good, but not great story of love's efforts to overcome the seemingly insurmountable. 3/5",Cold Mountain
112,WubsTheFadger,Cold Mountain,8,10 March 2018,"Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadgerFirst off, the film delivers a story that is profoundly powerful and heartbreaking. It shows us the needlessness of The Civil War and how it destroyed innocence and purity. The film shows us the drive and power of love and how it can overcome the greatest of odds. The ending is powerful and touching in so many ways.The acting is amazing. Jude Law delivers a stunning performance as a man who overcomes the greatest of odds. Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger also perform very well. Brendan Gleeson, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Giovanni Ribisi, Donald Sutherland, Ray Winstone, Kathy Baker, James Gammon, Charlie Hunnam, Jack White, and Cillian Murphy all add so much to the story and the devastation of the Civil War. Natalie Portman's performance really hit home for me. She plays a woman who has lost everything and just wants hope. She is broken and torn. Her performance was stunning.The pacing is a little slow, but I was completely engaged throughout the entire movie. The runtime is a little overlong.Pros: Powerful and heartbreaking story, touching ending, amazing acting, Jude Law's performance, Natalie Portman and her powerful acting, and a great message about loss, love, and warCons: Some slow pacing and an overlong runtimeOverall Rating: 8.4",Cold Mountain
113,Ronin47,"Well, the last hour is good (**1/2)",5,8 January 2004,"Miramax's ""gimme some Oscars!"" movie for this year, ""Cold Mountain"" is a distant and rather empty movie, but does manage to become pretty involving in its last hour. You just have to get through an extremely bumpy hour and a half to get to it, which isn't really worth it if you ask me.
Nicole Kidman and Jude Law are two of the several European actors trying on southern accents here (well, Nicole Kidman is Australian, but you know what I mean), as two southern lovebirds during the Civil War who barely let each other know of their feelings before Law's character, Inman, leaves for war. Kidman's Ada is then left home to fend for herself, after her preacher father (Donald Sutherland) dies and leaves her broke and hungry.
Near the start of the film is a huge battle sequence that in my opinion is not very well filmed, with its fake-looking, orange CG sky and comically overbearing choir music. Hospitalized soon after, Inman decides to desert and head home to Ada. And that's basically the meat of the story, we cut back and forth between Inman's journey on foot home (crossing paths with several would-be interesting people, but the only actually interesting one is played by Natalie Portman) and Ada's struggle to survive at home, with the help of a sassy local woman, Ruby (Renee Zellweger). After solidly disliking ""Cold Mountain"" for a long time, I was surprised to actually become quite involved in the last hour, when the plight that Ada and Ruby are facing becomes genuinely interesting and suspenseful, especially when dealing with the intriguing neighbor played by Kathy Baker. Kidman's character finally becomes interesting and so does Zellweger's, who seemed overbearing at first, but suddenly becomes likeable and sympathetic.
In a nutshell, ""Cold Mountain"" is pretty to look at and has good performances, but it's cold and remote for the most part, and only comes alive in a few isolated scenes. Pretty much like the other two Anthony Minghella films I've seen (""The English Patient"" and ""The Talented Mr. Ripley""). One note of interest is that it does feature the first and not-bad-at-all acting performance by Jack White of the phenomenal rock band the White Stripes, playing one of the members of Ada's father's bluegrass band. That's pretty cool, I guess.",Cold Mountain
114,dhaufrect,Accurate Adaptation of the Novel. Bravo,10,28 December 2003,"The screenplay adaptaion of the novel, ""Cold Mountain"", is perfection similar to that of a prior masterpiece, ""To Kill A Mockingbird"".

115,jrfranklin01,A Return to Classica,7,30 June 2004,"Probably one of the more pronounced impressions of this film is its dusty and nostalgic feeling for old classics.  It has all the right ingredients - a small farm town, a southern belle, her farmhand lover, a war, villains and deceivers everywhere, and your immortal tragedy.  But in order to bake a cake it takes more than just ingredients, it also takes exquisite chefs. And who better for such a job than Jude Law, Renee Zellweger, Nicole Kidman, Donald Sutherland, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, and Natalie Portman.I found the most difficult part of the movie to digest in terms of plot to be the short-lived courtship of Ada Monroe (Kidman) and Inman (Jude Law). Once you can accept that their almost nonexistent relationship has had an enormous effect on them both, the movie seems to movie along without further questioning.  The plot is very simple.  It is the Civil War and Inman is a confederate officer gone off to war.  Ada agrees to wait for him but months and then years pass.  To help her survive, Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger) comes to help her on the farm.  The two become close friends during dark times.  The only thing keeping Inman going out on the battlefield is the letters he receives from Ada.  When she tells him to come back to her he obeys, but the journey home proves harder than he ever could have imagined.I have wondered how true to life some of the elements of this story are. More men died in the Civil War than all the other wars combined.  That alone should give some indication of how gruesome life was at that time.  But for those that lived on or who sat at home and waited, praying for their loved ones to return, what was it like for them?  This movie tries to give some indication of that existence.  The horrors it shows I can only hope weren't real but in my gut believe they could have been much worse. 
This movie seemed to depict how two young people were trying not to fall in love and yet despite themselves did so completely.  Outside influence symbolized by the war is so determined to break them apart in their struggle towards one another.  When all else appears to have to gone to hell, these two individuals cling tightly to what they believe and pray they have left - each other.",Cold Mountain
116,polednick,Overrated drama,4,23 February 2021,"This is the usual Hollywood drama about the aftermath of the Civil War.

117,extravaluejotter,Misery Lesson,4,5 September 2006,"One of the astounding things about ""Cold Mountain"" is How Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellwegger's characters manage to keep their eyebrows in such good shape. Through famine and war, these two women maintain the most finely drawn eyebrows in movie history.It says a lot that I was able to notice Kidman's and Zellwegger's eyebrows with all the tragedy, action and pathos being chucked at me. To be honest, most of it washed over me, leaving me to ponder such questions as ""Why does Jack White sound like a whiny brat on his albums when he sings very well in this movie?"" and ""Did the producers of 'My Name is Earl' cast Ethan Suplee because of his role in this film?""Anthony Minghella has written and directed a hybrid of the classic Hollywood epic and the classic anti-war movie. In my mind, this fails to work because there is so little hope expressed. Inman's journey from Petersburg to his home at Cold Mountain is almost entirely depressing. He has to slog through pretty much every extreme of human cruelty on his way back to Ada, who is hardly having the time of her life at home. The film's only tiny victory is that Ada ends up with a loyal band of friends and family at the end. It's that perfect, trite, white middle-class ending, perched on the peak of a Golgotha of suffering, that made me give this film such a low score. This movie would have been so much worse with a less talented cast. However, it could have been so much better with a more original script.",Cold Mountain
118,Pavel-8,Hookless.,6,18 January 2004,"**Warning! Spoilers Ahead!**""Cold Mountain,"" based on the best-selling novel, tells a love story set in the South against the backdrop of the Civil War. Inman (Jude Law) plays a Confederate soldier who abandons his comrades to return to the woman he loves, Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman). Meanwhile back at the ranch, Ada has enlisted the help of mountain woman Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger) to survive.Right off the bat, therein lies the problem; the story that is intended to propel the film doesn't fulfill its purpose or promise. The first act love tale between the characters of Jude Law and Nicole Kidman isn't developed into a convincing relationship. Thus, without the necessary screen time or situations for the two to truly fall in love, the film has the unfortunate feel of a typical teenage romance, in which the two lovers fall for each other in a ridiculously short amount of time, based largely on looks and infatuation. The entire plot is based upon that hook, which provides each character with motivation to keep on keeping on. Rendered hook-less, ""Cold Mountain"" still looks great, but doesn't engage as great movies do, instead plodding along through the first hour.Then Ruby shows up, infusing ""Cold Mountain"" with the vitality it desperately needed. Zellwegger, continuing her remarkable run of stellar role choices, effectively provides the comic relief while remaining entirely within her character as a woman well-acquainted with the physical and emotional hardships of life. Despite being the less attractive of the two female leads, she maintains a magnetism that outshines even Kidman's strong acting chops. Zellwegger will likely earn an Oscar nomination and completely deserves such an honor.The rest of the cast ranges from solid but not spectacular (Law and Kidman) to surprisingly good (several stars in unusual roles). But the most entertaining aspect of the film was the long list of highly recognizable faces in minor roles. Many people will notice six or more ""names"" in parts that are slightly more than cameos, along with another half dozen faces that will be familiar to regular movie-goers. All of these actors turn in very good supporting work that colorfully fills in the background of the film.
That background, both on the screen and behind the scenes, may very well garner a basketful of Academy Award nods, and while I would dispute other acting nominations and any screenwriting award, I acknowledge the technical quality of the film. In his director role, Anthony Minghella (""The Talented Mr. Ripley,"" ""The English Patient"") has produced a quality presentation of a sprawling book, but as I have said, I point the finger at his adaptation, which failed to adequately evoke emotional involvement in the romantic aspects.With Romania largely filling in for the South, John Seale (Oscar winner for ""English Patient,"" ""Witness"") lenses a good-looking film, and that beauty contrasts starkly with the often excessive violence on screen. Composer Gabriel Yared, another Minghella favorite, again takes a relatively minimalistic approach, similar to his score for ""Possession,"" mixing Southern strains with typical film music to complement the film well. The score doesn't stand out like many of the year's dramatic work, but that's not a bad thing.Bottom Line: The film doesn't live up to its hype. When a movie aims high and misses, it often falls below what might have been had it aimed lower and succeeded. That is the case with Cold Mountain; although signs of brilliance were evident, one glaring off note holds the movie back at all times. A marginal thumbs up at best. 6/10",Cold Mountain

Doesn't shag anybody else, after just one bloody kiss, loves black people and even tries to help the Yankees.We then have Teaque, fat and ugly, nasty to the core, wants to shag Inman's betrothed love, wants to hurt and kill everyone.  As soon as a film follows this children's book story line, the realism and belief is totally lost.  How about Inman also hating black people, how about him getting the odd shag on his way home, why not.  How about Teague being good looking and generally ok, but felt he needed to do his job.

121,rcavellero,SUPRISINGLY WARM MOUNTAIN!,8,1 January 2004,"Cold Mountain is just full of suprises. I must say tht I did not completely enjoy this film. But I liked it alot.  I found it to be very creative and involving.  The love story aspect of the film isn't particularly invovlving but what the film does succeed at is showing the loss that war brings on. On all accounts, from loves to families to lands.  The horror of war is very apparent in a film that fills it's moments with constantly changing charachters, weird humor, and a war torn land. Some of the suprise pop ups include Natalie Portman showing her acting chops, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, The sexy guy from 28 days later, the guy from the white stripes and etc. The real reason I went to see Cold Mountain is for Nicole Kidman and although her porcelain presence and timeless acting are just as good as ever. Her role just isn't enough to sustain a real powerful performance. However Renee Zellwegger is the extreme stand out performance, with a rocky sense of humor and times of melodramtic overacting she contains into a heartfelt performance. Hottie Jude Law also does a fine job showing his charachter's complexities as he goes from one emotion to another. From acceptance to despair, from love to hate.  The film takes place during the last quarter of the civil war as Law and Kidman are seperated as he goes off to war. She longs for him as her father dies and he realizes the horrors of war.  She tries to keep the farm in shape as the local villain tries to take it from her, and she slips into lonliness from having no one and nothing. The war takes it tolls on everyone and everything and Renee Zellwegger enters as a young hard working woman whom decides to help Kidman. The only strong chemistry is those formed from friendships. The kidman Law love triste lacks it but they certainly look great together. Making probably the most sexy couple on film of the year! Cold Mountain doesn't draw any real tears besides a watery eye it remains overly warm and even though it's quite depressing it manages to leave you in good reassuring spirits.",Cold Mountain
122,alanjj,Much more vivid and enthralling than the book,10,13 January 2004,"I read the book and found it tedious.  The movie, though, is magnificent. The author, Charles Frazier, seems like one of these guys who really gets into describing everything--each action, each button, each leaf.  As well as the thoughts of the characters about these items.  Now, part of the plot is about the importance of knowing the names of things (Ruby knows the names of everything; Ada knows the names of nothing; Ada becomes one with her new land when she knows what things are called).  But reading this stuff was a horror, while watching it played out in widescreen technicolor with wonderful actors made it a fascinating element of a grand movie.The battle scene in the book is practically un-envisioned.  It's a vague memory in the mind of Inman, which he wants to forget.  The directors wisely decided to include a battle scene, and it is one of the best ever.  Two segments in particular--where the US troops appear out of the smoke, and where the troops get trapped in a ditch and a ""turkey shoot"" begins--are among the best I've ever seen.Visualizing the battle scenes makes the character of Inman seem so much more real.  You get a full sense of the horror he's experienced.  All his other actions afterward are understandable and seem trivial compared with the horror that happened all around him.The book did one scenario a lot better than the flick:  Inman's transition from a soldier to a deserter is poetic in the book, mundane in the movie. Inman is in a hospital, looking out the window toward Cold Mountain.  One day, he feels that he must go back to Cold Mountain.  He wills himself from the hospital room out into the world beyond the window.  The window goes from a frame for something distant, to a gateway to Inman's new reality. The movie treats this as an ordinary escape from captivity to a tenuous freedom, whereas the book made it magic.But the movie has so much other magic--it contains the best Phillip Seymour Hoffman performance ever--he's the perfect clergyman with  no scruples. Eileen Atkins as the frontier woman who can fend for herself is memorable.Especially great was Rene Zellwegger--it's a role meant for Mary Steenburgen or Holly Hunter, and she plays it to perfection. It's hard to believe she was ever the star of a splashy musical.  She embodies the self-sufficient country woman, and deserves Oscar No. 2.",Cold Mountain

It's all dark and everyone's getting killed or tortured.  And not to spoil the ending, but it's so depressingly awful.  I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone. It's not even a tearjerker in a good way, it's just plain depressing.  If you like Civil War movies, there are better ones out there, and there are plenty of better love stories out there that actually have happy endings, unlike this awful film.

124,FilmSnobby,A better-than-usual Miramax picture.,5,3 January 2004,"But let's not get too carried away.  *Cold Mountain*  emerges as a profoundly unadventurous film.  It's devoid of ambiguities . . . an unforgivable thing, given the setting of the Civil War, and the subject, which is the desertion of a Confederate soldier  (Jude Law)  who forsakes ""the Cause""  in order to return home to his wallflower Southern belle (Nicole Kidman).  This movie was based on a  ""prize-winning""  novel by Charles Frazier.  The story could withstand some improvement.  For instance, let's make things interesting by having Jude Law be a UNION soldier.  Let's challenge that multiplex audience just a bit.  Because after all, the ""moral problem""  of this picture as it now stands -- e.g., the hero's placing of higher importance on his love-life over his country -- has been solved far in advance.  OF COURSE any sensible fellow would desert the evil Confederate Army in order to get back to luminous Nicole.  Nicole is a worthier cause than States Rights . . . but is she worthier than Abolition? Ah . . . now the scene would begin to cloud, a bit.  And the Home Guard (who patrol the local area looking for deserters and otherwise  ""assisting"" those who remain home), represented by an unrecognizable Ray Winstone and several other heavies, provides the audience with straw men hissable enough to leave no doubt as to the justice of Law's desertion.  Or, if we must insist on keeping Law as a Confederate, why not make the Home Guard a bunch of nice old guys, rather than Winstone's murderous mercenary who also has a pecuniary interest in Kidman's property?  Or, even further, why not have the women at home remain fiercely patriotic, who would consider a deserter a gutless coward?  Then Law would actually have to WOO Kidman, a task he otherwise gets to avoid in this movie  (apparently, his suffering baby-blues are sufficient to make the lady weak in the knees, without the demonstration of any other virtues).But to ask for any of these possibilities is to ask too much from the likes of Miramax studio, and the wise viewer will regretfully put such considerations aside and cast about for other things to enjoy.  The fundamental emptiness of  *Cold Mountain*  gets redeemed by a number of things, starting with Anthony Minghella's expert direction, particularly with regards to the difficult time structure in the first half.  The picture is graced with astounding cinematography all the way through, but especially near the beginning during the siege of Petersburg:  the gigantic pit caused by a large underground explosion, and the resultant  ""turkey shoot""  by the Confederates after the Federals stupidly rush in, is smeared over with a dank, sulfurous haze, making the scene look like something from Hell itself. (The movie is otherwise gorgeous as hell.)  And finally, a large cast of well-known faces contributes, rather than distracts:  Philip Seymour Hoffman gets another opportunity to give a flashy performance; Brendan Gleeson, Kathy Baker, and Ray Winstone  (despite the phoniness of his part)  all provide strong support.  But praise is especially deserving to two young actresses:  Natalie Portman as a widow with a sick baby whom Law encounters on his trek home; and the wonderful Renee Zellweger as a sort of prototypical white-trash tomboy named Ruby.  Portman surprisingly, and magnificently, aces the crucial cameo part of the desperate widow . . . and Zellweger steals the entire movie out from under everybody's feet.  (Kidman knows it, and doesn't even bother to challenge Zellweger for supremacy in their scenes together.)  Once Ruby is -- finally -- introduced  (it takes almost an hour), the rest of the movie is basically a waiting game:  we wait for the next scene with Zellweger, and become indefatigably bored with the dour young man trudging homeward.  In fact, we didn't realize how bored we were with  *Cold Mountain*  until she shows up.  It's the serio-comic performance of the year, and the  ""Academy""  should feel free to give her a long overdue Oscar for it.  She makes this otherwise dutifully anti-war picture  (and hence, rightfully unpopular picture, given our current circumstances)  well worth seeing.",Cold Mountain
125,cnycitylady,"Cold Romance, Warm Story",7,2 April 2013,"Cold Mountain is a love story set during the Civil War. Now this movie doesn't move you to tears, it doesn't make you yearn for great romances but it doesn't quite leave you empty either; and that is because it was carried all the way home by one shell-shocking performance.The story is rather trite but not so boring that you refuse to view it to the end. The character's earn your sympathy and friendship but you don't really know what you want to happen, because you are unsure of what to root for. The love story may be a great one, but the casting and the acting takes away from it. Jude Law and Nicole Kidman have absolutely no chemistry and every scene where they are supposed to make love to each other just comes across as forced and awkward. The jewel of this movie is Renee Zellweger; She steals every scene she is in and almost without effort becomes all that you are interested in, in the movie. Her accent is flawless, and her emotional breakdowns and highs are what keep you tethered to your seat.Nicole Kidman, who is usually the star of her films, falls flat here. She plays sorority belle gone farm girl with a beau in the war, but she conveys almost no genuine emotion. Yes she looks as beautiful as ever but you cannot help but feel that should the role have gone to someone more suited to it that the part could have been great. Jude Law was okay, he looked the part but again, with Kidman as his love interest you don't really find him too believable.All in all Zellweger really saves the film. She knocked it right out of the park and truly deserved that Oscar awarded to her. All of the small parts played out by big names (such as Natalie Portman who makes an appearance) are really cool to pick out while watching it, and watching Jude Law interact with them on his journey home is thought provoking with how true and harsh it all must have been. 6.8/10",Cold Mountain
126,clydestuff,A tale of two movies,8,2 February 2004,"When Miramax spends $80 million dollars of their money to back a film, then spends another $25 million for marketing it, you can be sure that they expect huge things in return for their investment.  Then again what studio doesn't?   Most studios are pleased as punch when their films simply give them a profitable return on their investment.  I'm sure Miramax loves a profit margin as well as any other studio but for films like Cold Mountain they make them because of the little visions of gold Oscar statuettes dancing around like so many sugar plums in Harvey Weinstein's head.  Nothing wrong with that either, I suppose, but when you set out to make a film with winning awards being a top priority, everybody had better be at the top of their game.  It is apparent in Cold Mountain that everyone involved is trying hard to achieve greatness.Minghella bring us the riveting stories of a Confederate Soldier, Inman Balis, struggling to find his way back home to the life and the woman he loves, Ada Monroe.  Ada, at the same time is struggling to hold on to her farm with the help of Mountain woman Ruby Thewes.Cold Mountain is a breathtaking film to look at.  John Seale's cinematography of Civil War Battles and landscape is almost worth the price of admission alone.  Dante Ferrati's production design, especially in an early battle sequence will leave you gasping. Along with Minghella's direction, it will remind one of the opening sequence of Saving Private Ryan.  In other words, war is chaos and hell, and there's not much glory in getting your body parts blown around the battle field.I can find no fault with the acting in this film either.  Though some have been critical of Nicole Kidman performance and most notably her accent. I found her southern accent to be every bit on a par with many others who have played the Southern Belle but were hardly from the South.  It is (the accent) easily comparable to that of Vivien Leigh's Scarlett in Gone With The Wind.  As for her performance, it is a role that is not demonstrative, requires reserve and Kidman gives it exactly that.  So why fault an actress for staying in character and bringing to life the role of Ada Monroe as it was meant to be?Jude Law will quickly make you forget his robotic role in AI. As Inman Balis, he too is a quiet reserved Confederate soldier, who is willing to fight for the cause up until he has nothing left to give, and begins to see how hopeless and pointless the bloodletting has become.   
As mountain woman, Ruby Thewes, Renee Zellweger nearly steals the show. When she shows up to aid Ada in putting her farm back together, she brings new life to the film and the audience.  Having watched as Ada struggles just to stay alive, and as Inman deserts the Confederate Army, Ruby gives us a shining glimmer of much needed hope.  She is a strong willed, no nonsense woman, and with Ada and Ada's farm sees a chance to have something that would not have been possible previously.  There is not enough words available to me to talk about the excellence of the rest of the supporting cast.  Brenden Gleeson plays Ruby's no good father who returns for a last chance at redemption.  Eileen Atkins as the always concerned, always giving friend Maddy, who after witnessing one of many senseless acts of brutality in this film, is forever changed.  Natalie Portman as the young widow Sara, trying to deal with the loss of her husband while raising her ill child will make you forget completely about her stale performance in Attack of the Clones.  Ray Winstone, who plays the head of the local home guard, is as evil and lecherous a villain to ever disgrace the South.  Donald Sutherland is also on hand giving a touching portrayal as Ada's father.So, with all the great cast and production values, why does Cold Mountain fail to achieve greatness?  Unfortunately, it just tries to do way too much. Most of the blame is with the screenplay, and the rest of it has to be placed on the shoulders of director Minghella.  In trying to bring us so much story, we are never quite drawn into it the way we should be.  At times we are with Inman as he fights to make his way home, then we are returned to the story of Ada and Ruby on the home front. What this does is shortchange both stories.  The opening scenes between Kidman and Law pass by so quickly that we never truly understand the chemistry between them.  This is made even more difficult because Ada and Inman are both quiet and reserved by nature.  We can see where they may be attracted to one another but we never feel it in our hearts.  Ada's struggles on the farm and Inman's struggle to return home are both captivating in themselves but trying to tell both stories just doesn't blend together. Just as we are being drawn deeply into Inman's story, Minghella quickly whisks us away to check in on Ada and Ruby. By the time we may return to Inman's narrative, it has lost whatever momentum it might have gained.  I would have like to have seen a film about the story of Ada Monroe, Ruby Thewes, Maddy and Teague.  A film about a Confederate soldier deserting the army to return home would also have been a great film.  Putting these two stories together is trying to give us too much of a good thing, and sometimes it's better to have just enough than overfilling the cup.My Grade A-",Cold Mountain
127,gcrokus,Nice Acting,8,28 December 2003,"This movie, suffering a just a little from the semi-believability of the plot (a tale set in modern times and loosely based on real events; the real and somewhat less than heroic desertion a centerpiece for rumination), is nonetheless engaging and so well cast, acted and filmed it deserves a viewing.  The fans of ""Dances With Wolves"" will be delighted as well as those enamored of the Odysseyan journey-film, sure always to be populated with oddball characters, punctuated with humorous moments and almost always senseless violence.   ""Dead Man"" seems to be the only film of the recent past with the feel of ""Cold Mountain"", though the earlier film had more bizarre events than are recorded in the latter.  But here we must note the attractiveness of the cast in ""Cold Mountain"".  Renee would look great in a burlap sack, and Jude Law and Nicole are of the same ilk. The battle scenes are all quite good, although it is a bit of a stretch to think Inman would find his documents so readily after so horrendous an explosion.  And for the life of me I cannot determine how the ""turkey shoot"" devolved into a hand-to-hand combat situation within a few frames of film. Inman's journey (oddly from inland to coast to inland) expressly exploits the ""Dead Man"" aspect (or more recently ""Oh Brother.."") view of travels cross country.  Note the completely rural setting of all the scenes; even in the U.S. of the 1860's it would be difficult to steer such a course.  Not on any occasion is a large town sighted. There is more than enough good writing to offer us some laughs, but for certain Ms. Zellwegger steals the show.  Her portrayal of a country girl of resource and unbounded energy (I don't offhand remember anyone filmed walking so bouncily)is such a pleasure to watch almost anyone in the camera with her seems to be in a support role.",Cold Mountain
128,travisimo,A Gritty Look Back,10,13 January 2004,"If there was anything that really stuck out to me in Cold Mountain, it was the beautiful imagery.  The scenery was just amazing, and you really get a sense that you are looking at a Civil War-era South.  Some may complain that this movie lacked compassion or chemistry, but wasn't life back then a lot more restricted than it is now?I thought the actors did a tremendous job, but it was the side characters that really stole the show.  Natalie Portman gave a very strong performance in a small, but powerful scene.  Philip Seymour Hoffman provided some surprising comic relief as did Renee Zellwegger who really shined as a tomboy who resurrects Nicole Kidman's broken down ranch.  In fact, I'd say Renee deserves an Oscar for this role, but that's not for me to decide.The movie is a little long, but you come to appreciate the struggle Jude Law's character goes through as he treks miles to reunite with Nicole Kidman, all while being hunted down as a traitor.  I imagine this story isn't that far from the truth.  Life was quite different back then, as I noted earlier, and probably more ruthless, so it wouldn't surprise me that some people were hunted down like dogs.So overall, this is a very powerful flick.  It gives you a true sense of what life was like back then, and it's another adaption of the classic Odyssey tale that just never gets old.My IMDb Score: 10/10.  My Yahoo! Grade: A (Outstanding)",Cold Mountain
129,eastbergholt2002,Good Movie: Variable Acting,8,11 February 2007,"I watched Cold Mountain and the English Patient again this weekend. The former is a Civil War melodrama about Inman (Jude Law), a Confederate soldier who deserts the army to return to Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) a girl he barely knows. Both films were lovingly directed by Anthony Minghella who does an exceptional job. Although, Cold Mountain is very good it could have been a great movie with the right casting and less folksy, backwoods dialog.Romantic epics need a convincing heroine. The English Patient, had Kristin Scott Thomas who was perfectly cast as the smart, alluring and beautiful Katherine Clifton. The main problem with Cold Mountain is Ada who seems silly and dim-witted and lacks that quality would make you believe that Inman could become obsessed after one kiss. As an actress Kidman has a limited range, she usually plays stern-faced women who face adversity with stoicism. Kidman was also too old to play the ingénue and Law's love interest. The film needed a young actress who could play charming, warm and vulnerable. For someone who was supposedly enduring hardship and near starvation she seemed ridiculously well-fed and over-dressed. Kidman was so impeccably groomed that it looked like she had spent three hours getting made-up for each scene. Michele Pfieffer in her younger days could have played the part perfectly. Even Natalie Portman would have been an improvement.Renee Zelleweger was more appropriately attired but her animated performance chewed the scenery but maybe she was trying to compensate for Kidman. Jude Law was in his own silent movie in the Odysseus role, but played his part well. Ray Winstone was excellent as the London/Southern villain.During the Civil War, people were probably not very well educated by today's standards and maybe they did speak in monosyllables. However if you watch BBC adaptations of Dickens, Austen or Mrs. Gaskill everyone is articulate. Maybe this is unrealistic but it would improved my entertainment.",Cold Mountain
130,jackjack-2,"mostly fiction, historically inaccurate",2,1 October 2005,"One would think that the setting of this movie was in Kansas with Quantrills Raiders and the Jayhawkers, not North Carolina. This movie is full of brutal atrocities that never happened in North Carolina and to some extent not during the Civil War.For example is the rogue Southern militia rounding up deserters and punishing all they believed helped them. Deserters were not executed by the militia as depicted in this movie. They were turned over to the nearest Souther Army units and then sent back to their units where they were court martialed and executed as example in their own units.Another example was the incursion of a Union patrol into the North Carolina mountains in 1864. That did not happen but members of this patrol attempt to rape a widow with a baby. Never happened. One of the atrocities that didn't occur during the Civil War was rape. The entire scene was unreal. A patrol might scavenge for food but the soldiers would have most respectful to the woman, particularly since she had a baby. They would have been solicitous of her welfare.And then when the widow escapes from the soldiers, she finds a rifle that did not exist in the Civil War and shoots a naked soldier running for his life in the back. Pure nonsense.Then the Southern deserter has the horses of the Union patrol available to ride to his destination but instead of using the horses he continues walking across the mountains. Could he be that stupid? Nicole Kidman was completely miscast in this movie like trying to fit a square peg in a round hole. Even her costumes are too well tailored for a mountain girl.And her acting left a lot to be desired. Renee Zelwigger fit her part perfectly which was that of a homely mountain girl.All in all, this movie didn't bother with the facts. It was much more interested in titillating its viewers with sex and violence and any success it had was in doing that.",Cold Mountain

132,stevetseitz,A starkly beautiful film of great emotional impact,7,23 December 2003,"Nicole Kidman and Jude Law are two of the most beautiful people on the planet, so it shouldn't be difficult to understand why many critics are praising this film. Watching the emotions play upon their nearly perfect features is mesmerizing. Did any Confederate soldier really have teeth this good? Impressive performances by both leads (particularly Kidman's range) and a stellar cast bring this Civil War tragedy to a higher level. Brendan Gleeson and Philip Hoffman are wonderful. Natalie Portman is so convincing and heart-wrenching that one has to wonder what narcotics George Lucas had her on in Star Wars Episodes I and II. I will say that the opening battle scene was a huge disappointment. The choppy cuts and camera movement meant to give the documentary feel doesn't work here. The reason it worked so well in Spielberg's WWII era films (""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Schindler's List"") is because there were actual gun cameras, footage of combat and newsreel documentary footage as a frame of reference. The film feels gritty and authentic in all other respects. Excellent suspense is maintained up through the rewarding and mature climax.",Cold Mountain
133,Tashtago,Rushed,3,14 November 2004,"This movie suffers from a case of something that I find in a lot of newer films. The narrative or plot is rushed as if the director was in such a panic to get the story told that he forgot to develop the plot and characters. A great actor like Donald Sutherland is wasted in the role of Nicole Kidman's father. Case in point is the scene where Sutherland is trying to suss out Jude Law's intentions toward his daughter, the camera inexplicably pulls back in a monumental crane shot to reveal Kidman at a window listening. The effect is that we are supposed to somehow sympathize with Kidman. This is difficult to do while the dialogue is rendered inaudible and ineffective. Another remarkable weakness is the fact that the film is about the civil war but there is very little reference to black people. The ever hammy and over-rated Rene Zellweger comes across as giving the best performance only because her character is the only one that has more than one dimension. A waste of money all around.",Cold Mountain
134,CatRufus5591,Embarrassing.,4,13 September 2020,"...So the husband of one of my wife's co-workers and I struck up a friendship based on our mutual interest in anything Civil War- related. I'd read Charles Frazier's book and loved it; a beautifully written story. But I'd forgotten about some of the 'seamier' elements in the book (like a fat woman gyrating on top of our hero). I'd suggested we see the film together, the four of us, until I read an unfavorable review of the film that mentioned the sleazy, albeit brief, sex scene.
When the other couple arrived at our house I tried to head off the impending disaster by saying that the light snow outside might make travel to the theater hazardous. ""OH
NO!"" Exclaimed the husband, ""We MUST go.
I've been looking forward to this ALL WEEK!!!""
(Let me explain here that these are simple, semi-prudish 'country folk'. Okay.)
Hoo boy. So off we went. I could FEEL their discomfort throughout the film. Renee Zellweger: ""So have you RIDDEN HIM YET?""

Her line about the stupidity of wars, all started by them, comes naturally from the mouth of a person with a strong character like her - enough to make the principal of the romance change to a practical stance in life... Also, that sentence should be mandatory reading in high-schools, everywhere! (Expletives included...)She has already won a British award, and should win the Oscar in this category. IF there was justice on this world, which it ain't.For instance, it's impossible to give another prize to the beautiful Kathy Parker, whom lechers won't look twice at... shame on them!

136,the-gossip-king,Second time lucky,7,10 December 2007,"This is actually a very decent film. It centers around the cold war and has a beautiful cast with Jude Law (could have been a bit better) Nicole Kidman (very well done) and Renee Zelweeger (best of the cast who gives 100% and deserved the Oscar). Jude Law portrays Inman. He is a laborer in Cold Mountain N.C. He soon meets the mayor's daughter played by Nicole Kidman. The obvious occurs and they fall in love but only do they share a kiss just as Inman is about to leave for war. Five years go past and neither forget each other but it is clear that they are beginning to lose hope. Then when everyone is on the verge of tears from this very emotional story, in comes Renee. The funny, somewhat retarded farmer who helps Nicole through managing her farm shortly after Nicole's dad dies. She loosens the tension a bit but creates some new chemistry with Nicole Kidman.

137,mwendel,Too Much Hype Not Enough Substance (Spoilers),7,6 January 2004,"Typically I like movies like this, but at the end it felt just flat.  I had already guessed, as soon as Law's character is killed, that in the one night of sex Kidman and Law had that she would be pregnant and end up with a child.  I was just kind of surprised after having Law's character live that long that he would be killed off.  Law gets blown up, shot in the neck, trapped in a chain gang (of which every single one in the chain except him gets killed), and travels thousands of miles just to clean-up, shave, have sex, and get shot buy some nobody character?  That was a real downer.  He should have stayed in the cabin with Natalie Portman it was probably safer. The story was, in my humble opinion, flawed with much potential, but they went a little too far away from reality I think and the finale was kind of anti-climatic for the above-mentioned reasons.Thankfully, the scenery during the thousands of miles of walking was diverse and a visually stunning of sections of the country that haven't been on film in ages.  The civil war combat scenes were highly graphic and displayed the real horrors of war well.  The music to the movie wasn't the same old rehash that you hear in most movies today, so that was refreshing too.Renée Zellweger and the rest of the supporting cast is what helped me enjoy this movie and get through the whole movie.  Donald Sutherland, Jack White, Brendan Gleeson, Philip Hoffman, and Ethan Suplee, to name a few.  The characters are bright, colorful, and well garbed for the period to the best of my knowledge.  This is a film that you can watch on DVD.  I am sure some of the scenes are prettiest on the big screen, but a wide screen version on a 25"" TV or better will probably work just as well.No one's going to fault you if you don't watch this movie, but you will run into a lot of people who have seen it.

138,WCS02,I'll bet Charles Frazier has to be as pleased with the translation of his extraordinary work ...,10,26 December 2003,"A brilliant film.   The book was fresh, original and `tight' as stories go. On film, it's the best love story since West Side Story.  There's plenty of killin' and explosions to keep the story moving for the guys.  If Minghella decides to release a 3 hour director's cut, I will buy a copy.  Seinfeld had fewer eccentric characters than this gem.  I did not want it to end.  And then it did  brilliantly again.Every actor hit their marks.  Kidman has been exceptional for years Jude Law finds his talent here.  Both will get nominations.  Supporting: Zellweger, Portman and Hoffman are brilliant  Brilliant!  especially Zellweger and Hoffman.  Renee's worth the price of admission all by her lonesome.  Cold Mountain is a beautiful place to be.  True love is a beautiful thing to have.   Against the backdrop of war's horror  the brief life spans of the day  the inability of mail getting through, forcing those starving for a lover's words to cling to a single sentence, or a memory when words are unavailable  . . . these are things to be treasured.   Only those with dry-ice frosting in their veins can't see it.Favorite parts:  That the characters think / speak like they would in the era (as I imagine it anyway).   1860s South.  Zellweger and Hoffman are best in supporting roles.  The war is portrayed as realistically as I've ever seen it.  The war photography is gritty  real  the war action is painful and morally split - like a bayonet to the gut.   Remedies to repair damaged flesh are fresh out of Granny Clampett's doctorin' bag.

140,JAKastner,The Moose Hole - Review of Cold Mountain,6,3 January 2004,"What is with Hollywood and the concept of love in the mitts of great disasters? There can be no greater example of this obsession than the highest grossing film of all time, Titanic. Though the Oscar darling can be blamed for the most recent trend, it is not the first to start this. There's the classic Casablanca and many other films set in and around World War II that do the same thing that is happening today in war features. Many films have come out recently and tried to duplicate the same result as Titanic but none have come close. Miramax is hoping they can break that statement with their film set in North Carolina during the Civil War. The Great War that divided this nation from 1861 to 1865 has become a hot subject as of late but few have taken the time to really focus, accurately at least, what this war was truly about. Instead they focus on side issues and stories that were only a small piece of the puzzle that was this time period. Gangs of New York, which starred Leonardo DiCaprio, is a perfect example of this. If the subject matter of Cold Mountain and the historical time period are blended in a way that creates an accurate interesting tale then maybe more and more films will be able to do the same.The story follows the young Confederate soldier who has deserted his position in the army in order to return home to be with his pre-war sweetheart. Inman is a man of very little words and actions but when he discovers the new missionary's daughter, Ada, he is at even greater loss for words. The two young North Carolina residents seem to take an interest in each other but that development is quickly put in jeopardy as Inman goes to join the other young men of the South to defend their homeland from `Northern aggression'. After he is wounded after the Siege of Petersburg, he deserts the Confederate army and starts a long and tiresome journey back to Cold Mountain. Along the way, he encounters many different characters that both help and hinder his journey home. Back in Cold Mountain, things are no better for Ada for the farm goes into disarray after the death of her father. With help of a drifter named Ruby, she hopes to survive long enough to reunite with Inman once again. The story for Cold Mountain may have been a bestselling plot when it was in book form but up on screen it is nothing short of disappointing. The plot is pretty predictable with several actions leading up to `major' events that could be seen from a mile away. The feature runs into the same problems as Gangs of New York, which opened this same time last year, in that it tries to cram too much into three hours and loses its focus not too far from the end.Though the cast seems to be an impressive group of Oscar favorites, few of them really show off why they should be labeled as such in this film. The biggest problem has to be Nicole Kidman's character, Ada. In the beginning of the film, it seems as though her character should be a little younger then Kidman herself makes her out to be. How old is Kidman? Forty years old? Whatever age she is, the way the character is presented, it seems she should be a lot younger. Another problem is featured after the death of Ada's father. Obviously Ada is going through rough times taking care of herself and the farm all alone but her faces just holds up so well. Boy! The medical care back in the 1860's may have been crap but make-up was just spectacular. This sarcasm being said, they could have made her character a little less dolled up, cosmetic-wise, as the film progressed. Despite a somewhat impressive performance by Jude Law, the bottom line is that the so-called relationship between Inman and Ada lack substance. They barely know each other and yet the audience is made to believe that they act as if they have known each other all their lives and once the war is over, they can go back to where they started? And critics should especially be yelled at believing this after ranting on such films as Daredevil and Pearl Harbor for attempting the same thing Cold Mountain tries to pull off. If there is anything good about the cast, it has to be Renee Zellweger's Ruby, who really picks up the film where it seems to be heading for a continuous decline.Overall, Cold Mountain manages to outdo last year's Gangs of New York but like the English Patient, it takes the film a long time to get to its predictable and pointless conclusion. Once again the Union on the basis of the Civil War are demonized and made to look like idiots no more so then in sequences like the scene that involved Natalie Portman's unnecessary character. Even the issue of freeing the slaves, which was not the main issue of the Civil War though many try to make it that way,  isn't as focused on correctly as they could have made it. What would have been a lot more interesting then the bland `love story' would have been the more grand battle sequences and issues of statehood and homeland but those are only battered about here and there without developing into anything grand scale. The film presents a valid topic of the Confederacy wanting to start a war and even doing anything they could to fight the North but when it comes to the end of the war, they blame everybody but themselves for what has been brought upon them. Director Minghella could have done something like that but chose not to. Once again another lackluster Civil War feature is presented to the movie-going public. Hopefully the American education system can pick up where this film fails to lead up to.My Rating: *** out of 5 (Grade: C)",Cold Mountain
141,kellyadmirer,"Weak unintentional remake of, well, you know",6,19 January 2004,"I know, I know, this is the film of some fairly recent book that everybody loves. Well, to me it is just a lame remake of ""Gone With The Wind"" that is dumbed down for the modern era, with several essential ingredients removed because the film-makers probably feel they are too sophisticated for modern audiences to grasp. Girl falls for handsome dude, the Civil War is declared, everybody down on the plantation thinks this is just the coolest thing, handsome dude goes off to war, war is hell, girl's daddy dies leaving her to fend for herself, girl has a hard time keeping Tara, err, I mean the family farm going, handsome dude returns home all roughed up, girl and handsome dude ultimately wind up not together after all. The best part of ""Wind,"" Rhett Butler, is missing and replaced with the vastly inferior character played by Jude Law, and that isn't the only reason this is a lesser film.I will give credit where it is due. Renee Zellwegger absolutely steals the movie and runs around the block with it. Her character is refreshing and easily the best thing in the film. Some of the other supporting characters, such as Natalie Portman as a war widow in dire need of assistance, do fine work.But the list of faults is greater than the list of virtues. Jude Law is stiff and even more inarticulate than his character could possibly call for. Nicole Kidman is simply too old for the part of a naive preacher's daughter blushingly falling in love for the first time, and it is unbelievable that she continues looking daisy fresh even while supposedly suffering the greatest of privations. Donald Sutherland sleepwalks through his role as Kidman's father. The villains are one-dimensional and unbelievable, and the background townspeople who would have been a major factor in such peoples' lives pretty much non-existent with a few notable exceptions. There is a notable and inexplicable paucity of African-Americans, by the way, they seem to get thrown in for atmosphere once in a while and then disappear without a trace.War is hell, and this movie keeps hitting us over the head with that inarguable fact. Fluff it up with a few soap opera moments (women getting pregnant after one romance-novel type of encounter, for instance), some obvious foreshadowing (no, don't split up before going back down that mountain, someone always gets killed when that happens!), some really unnecessary and obscure plot complications with symbolism that just bangs away at your head like a gong (having a preacher try to throw a slave off a mountain after drugging her up but getting stopped from doing so by our oh-so-pure hero, then have that same preacher coincidentally save our hero later, what exactly were the screenwriters smoking anyway?) and you have ""Cold Mountain.""I have a pet peeve about films told out of sequence like this one. It is becoming a common tactic to tell films out of chronological order. The directors who do this are just telegraphing that they feel the story is insufficient to carry the film without tricks. This was terrific in ""Slaughterhouse Five"" thirty years ago, but is suddenly being used in films where it is pointless - as here. The most egregious recent example was ""21 Grams,"" where it was difficult to tell what the heck was going on despite the simple plot. There is absolutely no reason to tell ""Cold Mountain"" outside of normal order, and I hope this Hollywood fad passes away quickly. Please stop!I like history-based dramas. There was enough good acting and enough action and plot complications to keep my interest. This film, though, is not nearly as good as the hype it is getting as the big Oscar candidate this year. Zellwegger may deserve honors, but the rest of the film is just one step above dull.",Cold Mountain

143,teejayniles2345,Well worth renting - - a war movie with a heart,10,9 March 2005,"My wife and I enjoyed this studio adaptation of a superior recent novel and highly recommend it to film buffs. Not everyone rates it a ""10"" but it achieves a number of commendable priorities. It conveys the rage, gore, and horror of battlefield combat with its mass confusion (not being conveyed in the present-day coverage of the Iraqi Insurgent War and Afghanistan Taliban- al Qaeda battles); also, it highlights the ambiguity of ""Support the Troops"" when their place is so desperately needed back at the homes of their loved ones. I know that purists might object about the accents of the multi-national cast. It is, however, a treat to hear the talented actress Renee Zellweger have a go at the most rambunctious and endearing character of the entire film. The film's score and end credit music are quite excellent and demonstrate something of the character of that period of U.S. culture. The director and art-scenery department also have produced a landmark depiction, meant to update some of the cultural ""imaging"" done in the classic GONE_WITH_THE_WIND.

147,vvanpo,Movie passes but not Mountains,7,7 March 2004,"Starting in I had a trepidation that ""Cold Mountain"" was going to be sympathetic to the South. It takes place in the fictional town of Cold Mountain in western North Carolina.  The townfolk are constructing a church in anticipation of the arrival of the new pastor (Canadian Donald Sutherland) and his daughter (raised in Australia Nicole Kidman).  Sparks eventually fly between the daughter, Ada, and a carpenter, Inman (Englishman Jude Law).The romance between the two is supposedly the main plot point sustaining the movie but it's really to demonstrate the futility and eventual desperation of the Confederacy.  When war was announced, the menfolk of the town were enthusiastic to join the fight.  Three years later, some of them - those that haven't died - have had their fill of fighting and try to return home as deserters.Here's where the dramatic tension comes in the film.  The South had set up a Home Guard, a force granted powers to ensure deserters and the people who sheltered them were punished.  Naturally the Home Guard abused those powers and that's what we see in ""Cold Mountain"".I read one negative review regarding the lack of African-Americans in the film.  It is true their are very few scenes with slaves but I let is slide because the scenes take place mainly in the Appalachians where slavery was not common.  Indeed it gets me to thinking why the people there would want to fight for a system that was against their interests.What did confuse me were the mountains.  The Appalachians are ancient and rounded.  The film was shot in Romania and its craggy Carpathians.  I expected to see troikas in the mountain snow scenes.Lastly a reviewer remarked the Renee Zellweger appeared to be channeling Granny Clampett.  It was meant as a insult but I like that.  I now think of her character as Granny Clampett's Granny.",Cold Mountain

We've all come to expect that there would be some battle scenes in a Civil War film yet there was one scene at the start of the film and it was very short.It was basically a war about Southerners who were excited about getting into a war but after a few years decided to desert. Deserters are shot and those deserters are pursued throughout the film for their betrayal of the ideals for which they started this war.Yes, there was some good acting but the film dragged on and had very little action.It wasn't until after I read the reviews about the film that I found out it was made by the same dork that gave us one of the most boring films in history, ""The English Patient"". If I had known about this before renting this film, there's no way I would have rented this clap-trap.If you're in the mood for a mindless, boring, ineffectual film, then this is the film for you.For the love of everything that's holy, don't watch this nonsense.",Cold Mountain

The acting and the writing is excellent. The editing of the first 40 minutes is brilliantly done. The way Inman is flashing back to his meetings with Ada. Ada also recalling some moments with Inman. You really believe in the passion this couple has for if not each other for the idea of it when the their world is falling apart. The scene Jude Law has with Eileen Atkins is incredibly moving and deeply felt. Renee Zellweger is great in the role of Ruby. She is both hilarious and heartbreaking. Any scene with Sally is extremely well done. Kidman also gives an excellent perforamnce. She really inhabits the character and here ""there will be a reckoning"" kine is nailed. Cold Mountain has the best gun fight probably since High Noon. The action in the movie is consistently raw and shocking. The most underrated movie of the 2000's.",Cold Mountain
153,HardKnockLife210,Emotional and Balanced View of the Civil War,7,12 August 2004,"Cold Mountain was nominated for several Golden Globes, including Best Motion Picture Drama.  When time for the Oscars came, however, and the Best Picture nominees were released, Cold Mountain had been replaced by Lost in Translation.  I was further surprised when I realized that this movie was not unanimously acclaimed by critics.  Yet I knew that since there was such controversy over this film, there was all the more reason for me to see it. I came out of the theater having watched a very good movie, but after seeing the movie I also realized why many critics would not praise this motion picture.  Let me explain.First of all, the music from Cold Mountain, both the original songs by various artists and the original score by Gabriel Yared, was nothing short of incredible and I felt that it matched the film very well.  The film rightfully received three Oscar nominations for its original music.  Also, both Jude Law and Renee Zellweger put in solid, emotional performances, and Zellweger rightfully won her Best Supporting Actress Academy Award.  I also felt that the dialogue was well-written and genuine, evoking a flow of emotion from the audience.  The tragic aspects of the film are also shown to be full of emotion, and the story is paced well. The view of Civil War is well-balanced, showing corruption on both sides. However, my one complaint was the often awkward acting and staging by and for the minor characters.  They are obviously seen to be in a league not of their own.  One of the most controversial aspects of the film is Kidman's performance.  I felt that she played her role well, even though her makeup often made her seem out of place.  The other reason that many seemed to hate this film is because it seems to be a poor adaptation of Charles Frazier's book, focusing more on the love story than on the fighting itself.  I have not read the book, so I can not truly affirm or discredit this idea, but Minghella obviously focuses on the love story in order to make the film as emotional as possible.  I feel that this was a good choice in his writing and direction.Overall, a few minor flaws (as mentioned above) and some unneeded sex and nudity keep this one from reaching its full potential, which is a shame, especially as one considers the caliber of cast and crew involved with this movie.Final Grade: A-.",Cold Mountain
154,katydid4819,'Mountain' Stands Tall,8,17 April 2004,"Despite the reviews of this movie and its lack of major Oscar recognition, I thought it was one of the best movies of 2003. It is not only beautiful to look at, but it is both sad and hopeful at the same time. Every scene is equally as important as the last and in the end it feels like you have actually seen the lives of these people, felt their pain and understood them through it all.The great novel that this was adapted from is just the beginning of many amazing elements that came together to make Cold Mountain a success. The screenplay does not feel like too much has been crammed into in but loosely enjoys the story that it is telling. The dialogue feels right and even though all the actors could have improved on their accents, this flaw seems to fade into the background because the actors don't place the emphasis on their words to tell the story but rather use them as one of their many tools instead of the only one as is the mistake in so many movies.And as for those actors who couldn't create the accents...well, they can create characters. Nicole lives up to her title as Academy Award winner and gives a better performance than the one that got her that title. Jude Law's character is the simplest and he knows it. You won't see him stealing any scenes from his co-stars but that is what is supposed to be. Renee is the polar opposite of that. She is the comic relief for the film and she does it with grace. Her loud and very southern character of Ruby fits her well, but then again, so does everything else she does. She just further shows us that she is one of very few actors working today with a range that has yet to be defined. She is the focus of our attention whether we want her to be or not.The entire film feels very natural and is one of the years best. ****/****",Cold Mountain

I had quite high expectations before seeing it (even if the name of Anthony Minghella should have made me suspicious), but this film didn't even meet my lowest expectations. Though shot in beautiful landscapes (in Romania, I read), it is overblown, boring and didn't touch me at all. Only in a very few moments I felt that all this could have been much better - as in the sequence with the young widow (Natalie Portman) searching a moment of comfort with Inman (Jude Law). Renée Zellweger's genuinely comic performance was also one of the few good points - even though the script didn't help her much.And please: Nicole Kidman is quite a good actress, but she was definitely too old for this part - especially with her Botox-ridden features... Compare her in this movie with her superb and fresh performance in the amazing ""Dogville"", only about a year earlier. What a downfall... :-(",Cold Mountain

So why did I despise the director for making it, how could he waste so much of a good thing, lack so much common sense, live in such degradation, and ruin such a plot? So, I read other commentaries to see if I'm psycho. It seems I'm not alone, there are others, very bitter and disappointed.I thought Law was supposed to be good, well he is, so why waste it?Kidman begins to shine, you start to feel her character, and she is loosing that, I'm a cold bitch look, I could fall for her now, but wasted character.Well Renée? We've got to love her for this part, she was having fun and so was I. She did well despite the likely best parts on the cutting room floor.A supporting cast? Whow!, long list of wonderful character and characters that filled the basket even fuller, but the production scattered it all to the wind. No matter how well they did, it was an impossible task of bringing it all back together.Where does this creative crew live? The dark side? With no personal fortitude, no faith? The whole world sh-ts on them? Life's not worth living? Then, what a cheep shot for and ending scene, there is no redemption in guilt. Do a good job in the first place. Something more than Ruby should have shined.When having something good, it should have been building plot and character, but it quit cold, when it should quit and move on, it dragged on, then came back and threw in more. This movie started so many good ideas and characters it didn't use, and wasted so much on the irrelevant. There is enough real horror in war without creating your own useless paranoia.Damn it was a good movie, why couldn't it have been a good movie.Ratting is hard.

159,benc7ca,A Whiter Shade of Pale,8,7 July 2004,"Anyone of colour in this movie is relegated to `walk-on, walk-off' or `drop dead and stay that way' roles.  Even `Gone With the Wind' managed to convey less on-screen apartheid.  This is a movie about white people and white peoples' preoccupations in a war being fought essentially over the rights of black people.  So where are they? We understand in a phrase or two that Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman) owns slaves; she uses their unseen presence as an excuse to talk with Inman (Jude Law).  Then, much later, in a toss-off sentence, we understand that she freed them. How very liberal. In the beginning, all the men are happy that they got their war.  But what are they fighting for?  Later, Inman walk away from `a cause he no longer believes in', but what was that cause?  I believe that the purpose of this vagueness is to keep audience sympathy with the main characters who are fighting  this war to preserve states rights and to OWN SLAVES. A braver film maker would have conveyed these paradoxes, not been afraid of them. The life of non-slave owning rural whites (and let us remember that they were the majority of the Southern population) is portrayed realistically as one of semi-literacy and hard-labour,  punctuated by  fervent and musical religious expression. The scenery is beautiful, Nicole is beautiful, Jude is beautiful (even when he's ugly).  Their relationship, founded on a few glances and even fewer words, lasts an Odyssey of time and travel.  Frankly, I believed it.  The privileged upbringing of Ada, alluded to by her dress and deportment and later on by her incompetence at anything practical, would have predisposed her to this very passionate, frustrating attachment. The type of fiction she would have read (we hear her reading `Wuthering Heights' aloud to Ruby Thewes (Renée Zellweger) is all about intense, thwarted passion.  But Ms. Kidman is a superstar and has arrived at that place where all I can see is Nicole Kidman and not the character she wishes to portray. Ms.Zellweger finally convinces me that she can act and steals every scene in which she appears.  Jude Law is soon to arrive at that superstar category where he can only be `Jude Law', but thank God, he isn't there yet. He's wonderful.The opening battle sequence is justifiably famous and will be the new benchmark for period war filming.Let me mention the music in this movie which is a true highlight.  Powerful, evocative and, for anyone who isn't familiar with Sacred Harp (Fasola), a revelation.The book( and I urge everyone to read it) was a wonderful read BUT the movie is not the book.  Judge the movie as a separate, independent work.  I have no patience with people who cry `But the book was so different'.  Of course the book is different; it's a different medium. If anyone is at all interested in the period, I would suggest they read `The Civil War Diaries of Mary Chestnut', a work of non-fiction written by someone who was there and at the very top of the social heap.

Everything about it seems to be a conspicuous grab for prestige and Academy Award consideration. But more often than not things go horribly awry.Its a splendid looking film, but the design more correctly evokes Trannsylvania than the Old South. More than once I awaited gypsy caravans and torch bearing villagers.In homage we have Jude Law dressing up as the Wolf Man for much of the running time, stumbling through thickets in search of Nicole Kidman. He has the good sense to keep his mouth shut most of the time - his accent being so studied that it lacks all credibility - adopting a generally pained expression that suffices for most emotions.Nicole Kidman is simply woeful. Much too old for the part, she lapses between Australian twang and Southern drawl to basically nil effect. We simply don't care about Ada as portrayed by the now familiar Kidman twitches. Renee Zellweger makes amends for Kidman stealing the Oscar that should have been hers for Chicago by stealing Kidman's film from under her. Its not much of an achievement, given that La Kidman seems to be asleep for most of the film.Amongst the mugging supporting cast, Giovanni Ribisi stands out, incomprehensibly decked out as Theda Bara with a beard.It may go on to triumph at the Oscars, but that will be small consolation to people suckered into seeing a sterile, boring film.",Cold Mountain

167,hokiemo,Worth Watching,7,23 August 2004,"This is a good but not excellent film. To begin, at 152 minutes, the film is too long. I could have easily cut out 30 minutes of the film with none the wiser. Nicole Kidman and Jude Law do well with their scripts, but are they too old for their parts? I haven't read the book ""Cold Mountain"" so maybe their characters are suppposed to be in their thirties. I have no problem if the characters are supposed to be in their thirties, but it would have been interesting if this had brought out more in the film as people used to get married much younger.Further, I think parts showing Ada messing up domestic chores should have been included, a bit like Scarlett O'Hara in ""Gone with the Wind"". Ada Monroe mentions her naivity in farm and house work, but adding some humorous learning experiences for Ada to a somewhat sad film could have added more realism to her transition from fair haired maiden to skilled markswoman.Also, I'm not a prude, but the sex scene between Ada and Inman in my opinion is softly p*rnographic and unnecessary. I think more awkwardness would have occurred between Ada and Inman for their first time yet Ada appears to be a skilled and unhibited lover. I think less should have been shown and more imagined by the audience.Renee Zellweger is excellent as Ruby and most believable as her character. Lesser known actor Brendon Gleeson as Ruby's father also does a fantastic job in his role.The film's cinematography is excellent and the scenery gorgeous.

The opening battle scene was quite gruesome and brought home the true horror of a war fought on land that belonged to all of the participants, and which ran red with their blood. When the battle was over it was time for the real story to unfold, the real story, not of war or desertion or slavery but a story of love and journeys. Jude Law as Inman, makes a long and treacherous physical journey back to the arms of his soul mate whilst she makes a journey from somewhat spoilt and superficial girl to strong determined womanhood. There are many that will rail against the historical inaccuracies, and the script, and the acting - but the story was well told.Bravura performance from Ms Zellweger and excellent support from Brendan Gleason, Philip Seymour Hoffman, Charlie Hunnam and the wonderful yet still underated Kathy Baker.

Yet, Minghella managed to portray this weak romance into something fabulous that at least in the middle of the movie, we somehow FEEL that Inman and Ada do love each other. The scene in which Ada and Inman sit by the fire chatting is superb -definitely one of the highest point of the film, but the film goes stale after that. The final shooting scene is somewhat redundant (kinda remind me of old stupid Westerns); it's like a reminder of the lingering of the civil war but it simply falls into the wrong place.

Ada is immediately attracted to Innman as well, and after only a few meetings they have fallen madly in love with each other. But they never get a chance to form a real relationship, because Inman is soon sent off to fight in the Civil War.Inman is gone for several years, and Ada continues to hope for his return and send him letters. While in a hospital bed, Inman receives a letter from Ada; ""If you are fighting,"" it reads, ""quit fighting. If you are marching, quit marching. Come back to me.""And Inman does - he gets out of his bed, and sneaks away in the night, heading back to Cold Mountain. He treks through the wilderness, avoiding the army (he is a deserter, after all) and running into several interesting characters, including an adulterous preacher and a widowed mother. Ada, meanwhile, is having trouble maintaining the farm after the death of her father. So Ruby Thewes, a strong-willed southern woman, is sent to help out. Upon arriving, the first thing Ruby does (other than berate Ada), is rip the head off of a troublesome rooster. Soon, the farm is nearing its former glory. But not all is well. The head of the local ""home guards"" has his eye on Ada and her land. Things continue to get worse when Ruby's father, another deserter, and his band of musicians (including a surprisingly good Jack White, of the ""White Stripes"") show up for a visit.

(Long story).What makes the film fall short of perfection is that it at times drifts away from Inmans quest. Making it confusing, and sometimes annoying. It looses focus quickly on Inman's quest, his journey home and that hurts the film. It relies too much on supporting characters. By supporting I mean characters that last no more than 5-10 minutes. No importance really to a good portion of them. ***1/2/*****",Cold Mountain
180,ghigau,Not THAT good,5,1 January 2004,"OK, it is a pretty good film. It certainly does not glorify war, which always is an excellent point. The performances were all good, though I did not see how Kidman survived as long as she did after her father died and before Zellweger arrived. The human gene pool can be improved at anytime when we lose a person with such poor survival skills (should Paris Hilton be far behind in a Darwinistic world???). So, if the performances were finely crafted, why isn't it the best film of the year? It's trite. You always can guess the outcome of a scene, so the film begins to drag. Jude Law deserved to survive, but after dodging thousands of bullets, he falls slowly from his horse after a pistol shot from a somewhat distant, mounted evil-doer (homage to Dubya). Everyone else in the film explodes when he is shot, but Jude Law melts. Come on. Shane showed us that big calibre guns throw you backward. And even well-aimed shots usually miss moving targets. Mortality in war is luck, not marksmanship, and most wounds are not fatal (check out the wounded vs. killed statistics for Vietnam, for example).",Cold Mountain
181,debrahnava-52496,Never Before Has Movie Touched Me So Deeply...,10,16 May 2018,"As I write this, I may be going on the 10th time viewing Cold Mountain. I was watching another movie on Hulu/Showtime and it rolled over and it dodn't Have the heart to change it. This movie never gets old.., the characters so rich albeit beaten. To call it a war or romance movie - doesn't do it justice. It's a movie about humanity or more often the lack of it. It's about survival and redemption. The way all the smaller stories wind around the larger is brilliant. Some may think it's depressing and maybe they're right, but I think Cold Mountain presents life, and it's trial and tribulations. Sometimes we control what happens - most time we don't. If you haven't seen this beautiful movie - gorgeously acted - give it a chance with no preconceived notions. You will not be diappointed.",Cold Mountain
182,nikhil-damodaran,Epic!,7,2 July 2012,"You might just want to flip over your Civil War classic Novellas. Well this movie just does that for you. In a telling tale of love in times of war, men in times of service to country, and a women trying to cope with sudden helplessness! The ingredients are just right. This story parallels back and forth two lovers. One who goes for war and hopes to get back home to this other who is touched by some feeling that she is ready to wait till he comes back. What is really beautiful are the emotions of this young man in upholding hope of reaching back just to try and tell her that she wants to marry her. Amidst the ravages of war, the experiences in those times of men running away from their cavalry and being declared a criminal on charges of treason; is handled superbly. The subtlety of the multiple stories while the protagonist travels back is amazing. If one is really not impressed, then there are more on the other side where the female protagonist tries to uphold herself. An upper class petite girl faces the hardship she never expects. There is where the icing of the story also lies (Renée Zellweger). For all the depth, it finishes beautifully.Hence a 7.5 out of 10.",Cold Mountain
183,hypersquared,Tasteful and Dispassionate,5,17 December 2003,"""Cold Mountain"" certainly lives up to its name. It is a monumental film with almost no hint of a beating heart. To call it cerebral, as The Hollywood Reporter did, is to put a kind spin on the utter lack of passion in the storytelling and the performances, and also suggests a heady element that maybe I just missed.From the first frames of the picture, the level of professionalism from Anthony Minghella's frequently enlisted team of craftspeople -- John Seale, Dante Ferretti, Walter Murch, Gabriel Yared, and others - is undeniable. They certainly have their act down. (At one point in the movie, I kept myself entertained by counting the impending Oscar nominations, and that game went on for some time). The film is elegant, even pristine, and so very tasteful. Within minutes, though, it's also clear that it is to be a film in which every character speaks like an aspiring poet, regardless of their level of education or their wits. The story, which the film makers purport to be about man's eternal failure to respect natural law, gives itself a cramp trying to be literate. Yet in the final outcome, it has managed neither authenticity nor poetry nor philosophy, leaving me to wonder what all the florid dialogue was in service of. The picture nearly chokes on its pedigree. Minghella stuffed the cast with Oscar-credentialed actors (both past winners like Nicole Kidman and nominees like Jude Law) and others, like Donald Sutherland, whose very presence seems intended to maintain an air of prestige. The lot of them seemed as bored as I did with the script's simplistic philosophizing (is Law's character really dodging bullets and trudging through swamps so he can find some hermit woman who'll enlighten him that he's just part of the circle of life?). As a result no one in the cast, with only a few exceptions in the bit parts, ever manages to transcend who we know them to be. Kidman is Kidman throughout. Law is Law. Sutherland is Sutherland. Zellweger is, to a lesser degree, Zellweger, but she's also the movie's only consistent comic relief so she's spared the worst of the effect. Kidman and Law, for their parts, look like they're asleep for most of the picture. The passion, the ennui, and the despair they both supposedly suffer is talked about, inferred, and presumably understood on the part of the audience, but I'll be damned if you can find a trace of it on their faces. Kidman especially is never given her due as the actor of incredible spunk that we know her to be. I know she could have played Ada's overwhelming fear of death - her loved one's as well as her own. If she can carry off a prosthetic nose, surely she could have let her skin take a weathering from all the hunger and hard labor her character endures. Someone decided to not let it happen that way, rather that she should remain the radiant movie star throughout, and it was a catastrophic choice, undermining the depiction of rugged endurance that the movie so desperately needs. Renee Zellweger hams it up like a pro, and if the rest of the cast had looked a touch more alert, she might not have seemed so completely over-the-top at times. Still, she gets to say stuff like, ""You can get three feet up a bull's ass just listening to what sweethearts whisper to each other,"" and she hits the proverbial ball out of the park every time she does. It's a showboat of a role, but in the absence of anything else really happening, her levity was really quite welcome. And yeah, she's probably got the Oscar in the bag. Natalie Portman, whom I was shocked to find I did not recognize, is featured in the movie's only genuinely touching sequence. Her advantage was to land the role that is the least heavy-handed in the writing, and she rises gracefully to every nuance the page offers her. As a widowed mother caring for her sick baby in a cold house, she subtly negotiates an arrangement with Law's war deserter that both satisfies her unfathomable loneliness and respects his spoken-for heart. After twice succumbing to the rigor mortis of the ""Star Wars"" pictures, her re-emergence as a natural, warm-hearted actress is the greatest gift that ""Cold Mountain"" offers. Also, the veterans Kathy Baker, as Kidman's kindly neighbor, and the great Ray Winstone as a deserter in at least two senses, are also spot-on: never forced, always real, bringing welcome doses of gravitas to every scene they're in. The greatest disappointment for me in ""Cold Mountain"" is that it's the first Minghella film to paint strictly by the numbers. Everything of his I've ever seen has taken the form of a well-known model and then upset it with something wholly unexpected, but this latest holds not a single surprise. ""Truly Madly Deeply"" took the same premise as ""Ghost,"" and then played against every known rule by first suggesting that the ghost may be a creation of the widow's neuroses, and then delivering as its message that love is not eternal, but that death demands that the living get on with their lives. ""The Talented Mr. Ripley,"" though messy and somewhat ungainly, was a mesmerizing balance of travelogue and psychological thriller. ""The English Patient"" is most similar to ""Cold Mountain"" in its intent, an epic romance playing equally to the head and to the heart, but it was one that actually deserved the ""cerebral"" descriptor and also brought hard-earned tears to my eyes. ""The English Patient"" made me feel the cleaving knife of choosing love over country. It hurt to watch Fiennes endure his choice in that film. No such sense of pain gets through in ""Cold Mountain.""",Cold Mountain

185,boomerchinde,Good depiction of a little noticed by-product of the Civil War,7,10 July 2007,"If you are a Civil War or American History buff, then you'll appreciate how this film addresses an ignored aspect of that violent part of our past known as the war between the states. Although mired in a somewhat predictable and sappy love story, it pointed out very well how many common folks were abused by their own people as these miscreants preyed upon their vulnerability. Beautifully photographed, with set designs accurate to the era. I thought Nichole Kidman was miscast in the primary role, which is difficult for me to admit as I believe she is one of the most talented actresses in the business today. However, it was Renee Zellweger who stole the movie. This actress never lets her ego get in the way of playing any part, even if that part lacks glamor. I recommend this film on several levels -- acting, directing, and historical significance. Weakened only by a trite ending.",Cold Mountain

No pressure...It succeeded.  It's a great movie, gritty, powerful, engaging, and wonderfully directed and acted.  It's not quite amazing, but it's worthy of the attention it has received (namely by the Golden Globes).As much as I love Nicole Kidman and how well she did, Renee Zellweger is the best part of the movie.  Her often humorous, yet diverse, roll was perfectly done on her part.  Jude Law was great in the roll that where all the ""gritty"" parts take place, as he is a soldier in the Civil War who escapes to travel home (treason).  Nicole Kidman tries to have a southern accent, and it slips every now and then.  I'm not sure if she was supposed to have a big one, as I think her character doesn't originally come from the south...at any rate, she's great, as usual.  While it's not as ""rangey"" of a character as past performances (namely Moulin Rouge), she takes her role and owns it, sans a perfect accent.I didn't care for all the historical, not harsh, gore, but that's just me.

Quite honestly I never cared much for Nicole Kidman before I saw her in this movie. She was absolutely stunning. This is the first movie that I ever remember seeing Renee Zellweger in. I fell head, over hills, in love with her character, Ruby. I'm from the south, and am quite familiar with southern accents, and this is one of the few movies I've seen where the accents of everyone included were done with perfection, especially Ruby. As a rule I'm not a big fan of movies involving romance, but this movie had a very poignant twist to the romance involved. It ended with such profundity, that this 59 year old mans eyes filled with tears. I can't think of enough good words to describe what an absolutely wonderful movie this was.A little bit of trivia. The revolver that Inman was using in the beginning of the movie was a pretty unique weapon. It was a Le Mat, nine shot 44, 42, or 44 caliber revolver, which also had another short 18 gauge barrel in the center of the cylinder. It was essentially confederate weapon, but by the end of the war it was, like a lot of other weapons, in the hands of both sides.If you don't see this movie you're missing a very enjoyable experience.",Cold Mountain
189,mymtproject,A very good time period movie,10,29 November 2016,"Most Civil War movies have a tendency to overly dramatize the war scenes and ignore the day-to-day struggle of the common people caught in the middle. Not so with Cold Mountain, a movie that explores the individual lives of a preacher's daughter, her farm hand and her lover as their world spins out of control.Renee Zellweger delivers a tremendous performance, while Nicole Kidman and Jude Law are strong in their roles as well. This is a movie about memory and destiny. The conclusion will leave you with conflicting emotions but there's satisfaction from a story well told.I hope that producers learn from COLD MOUNTAIN and start making more era dramas that give you a connection with the characters and their times, as opposed to overly glorifying battlefield scenes. The lone battle scene in COLD MOUNTAIN was the battle of ""The Crater"" during the Siege of Petersburg, Virginia. It is done with attention to the facts and illustrates the battle in all it's goriness. You felt like you were right there in the thick of the smoke, dirt and blood.The rest of the movie explores how the people of the 1860's coped with the savagery of their existence, how some remained in tune with their humanity and others devolved to murderous animals.

This was a side of the Civil War that was relatively unknown to me--the desperate situation back on the home front, particularly involving self-righteous individuals searching for deserters. I found the movie incredibly moving, the war scenes horrific, and the love story unbelievably touching.Bottom line: Any movie that moves me to tears once earns a high rating in my book.

193,JWBly,Ridiculously predictable and BORING,2,24 October 2007,"This is the kind of film that women almost universally like, and men generally hate. Jude Law gives a wooden performance as a deserter from the Confederate Army whose one mission is to return to Nicole Kidman, a woman whom he barely knows. Along his merry journey home, he meets a collection of other cowards and deserters, and has many adventures. Historical inaccuracies abound as apparently the entire Confederate Army was trying to desert, and the film lovingly celebrates these acts of cowardice. Kidman herself, whose meager talent has always been grossly overrated, gives another forgettable performance here. The one bright spot is Rene Zellweger, who gives the film some welcome comic relief. She plays a woman who apparently is one of the few people in the South with a Southern accent. Her performance is marred only by one over-the-top antiwar speech, intended to be a dramatic highlight of the film but which turns out to be unintentionally hilarious. Ethan Suplee and Giovanni Ribisi are also good in minor roles, as both apparently are developing their characters for use in MY NAME IS EARL. Except for some interesting battle scenes early on, there is nothing at all in this movie to hold a man's attention. It plods on at such an excruciating pace that Jude Law's death is a welcome signal that the end of the film is near. An hour of the film could easily be cut with no loss of quality.",Cold Mountain

I don't think there was a single line of black dialog. 2) The soldiers of the Union are portrayed as being no better than those of the treacherous South. 3)Renee Zellwegger is obnoxious. 4)I've never seen so many animals callously mutilated in a movie!If you want to see an adaptation of The Odyssey set in Dixie, O Brother Where Art Thou is much better. 5/10",Cold Mountain
195,rogerhwerner,This is less of a film review and more of a commentary of some of the reviews herein presented,8,28 January 2021,"Reading through the many reviews it's obvious that in spite of their confident tone, most have little real knowledge of the period beyond what they've seen in movies. May I suggest that these self-absorbed experts read the novel on which the film is based and then read some 19th century social history and a few histories of the post-Gettysburg South. The relationship between the two main characters, Inman (Jude Law) and Ada, (Nicole Kidman) is rather accurate and sufficiently developed to drive the plot. Young people unfamiliar with how love developed even 75 years ago need to understand how loving relationships evolved in the Victorian era: in fact, the main relationship is portrayed quite accurately, and if that seems underdeveloped...well, it isn't. The Ruby character (Rene Zellweger) is terrific, presenting an excellent contrast between the well bred quintessential Southern woman and the generally not well film-documented hardscrable backwoods woman. The Battle of the Crater at Petersburg July 1864 is not overly detailed but accurately represented. The trials and tribulations of the Confederate Home Front present, in all their glory, a willingness of some people to abandoned personal honesty and honor in exchange for power and wealth, providing a plethora of hissable villany. Cold Mountain is a long film at more than 2 hours and 30 minutes but it's thoughtful, absorbing, and very well acted but be forwarned: it isn't a war film but a dramatic antiwar movie.",Cold Mountain
196,The_Real_Review,Are you Kidding me? Oscar Nominate this? Please.,2,15 July 2004,"Are you seriously kidding me? This movie got Oscar nominated for what? After watching this I thought someone was pulling my leg. Lets start off with some facts. This is a civil war movie filmed in Europe. Totally inexcusable. The location was enough to make this movie doomed. But no instead we get a LONG drawn out movie where Jude Law ""Inman"" dies at the end after watching him live through every sort of situation imaginable he gets into a talking duel with Cold Mountains ""Billy the Kid"" and slowly dies. Come on! How cliche is this? Not only was the end of the movie pathetic it was anti climatic. What a waste of an opportunity. You had all the makings of a good movie and all the necessary characters early on, instead the script calls to kill everyone off slowly throughout the movie. The art of good script writing is dead. To many movies like this. Yes war is bad and people die, why not show us the smart ones who live through it and how they did it.Now lets not get me wrong Jude Law does a good job trying to be southern but I can't get over he is from England! The producer of this movie needs his head examined filming a Civil War movie in Europe with an English lead actor. Nichole Kidman does a good job but she just remains way to clean compared to the supporting cast and it stands out, she looks out of place even when they try to ""dirty"" her. Things like this and the completely depressing pathetic ending not to mention the overly long movie run time make this just not a very good film.Movies with bad endings are always easy to spot. They never get much public support. The reason is simple people DO NOT like to be depressed. That is why I was so hesitant about Cold Mountain. I kept hearing Oscar Nomination but no big push by the public for it. Some things never change. Maybe one day these producers and directors will learn that people really do enjoy good, smart movies about redemption, hope and happiness. Not sappy tragedies. There is a reason Shakespeare is only brought up in literature class and Cold Mountain was named ""Cold Mountain"". Sometimes its obvious, what a waste of time.",Cold Mountain
197,bzb2001,Direction and acting a savior,6,5 January 2005,"Anthony Minghella is a master of the old fashioned love story. His films do not house cynicism nor bad intentions. His two previous efforts, 'The Talented Mr. Ripley' and 'The English Patient,' were so good I had them at the top of my top ten lists for their respective years. In the case of 'The English Patient,' I believe it even outdid 'Fargo.' The classic beat the absurd.'Cold Moutain' is different, it is a long film. Not particularly its running length, which I don't surmise is much longer or shorter than 'Ripley' or 'Patient.' It is long because many of the actions in the film are not entirely that entertaining.We start toward the end of the Civil War. At a bombed out confederate strong-hold we meet Inman, not so different from the other soldiers. It is as if by happenstance that we should immerse ourselves into his life rather than anyone else out there. Inman, we learn, has been separated from his love, Ada. Although as we soon find out, Ada and Inman hardly know each other. It was fate, or love at first sight, that brought the two together. It was bloodshed and war that tore them apart.In ways this seems hokey, and it is. Minghella had done so well in his other films to stay away from sappy, in this one he dives right into it. As the story moves along we understand their feelings deeper, and thus some sappiness goes away, but to many it will be too heavy to bare.Inman deserts his comrades knowing the end is coming. He is far more interested in meeting up with his Ada, though the journey will be perilous. As he leaves, the Confederate Army everywhere begins to hunt down deserters and those who let them stay on their land. Inman's journey becomes an 1860s Oddysey through the American south. Along the way he meets an amorous preacher, runaway slaves, a widow and her baby, as well as your standard country cabin full of horny women.These stories are okay but lack any cohesiveness, it is the same problem that faced 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?'. 'O Brother,' however, was an all-around better film, the pace quicker and the characters better situated. All this having been said, the guilty truth is that I liked it. I tried reading the book at least four times and could not get past the first few chapters. I figured the movie had no chance.There is plenty wrong with it, but the gorgeous cinematography and exquisite acting made the film sweet enough to swallow. Listen to the names: Jude Law (as Inman), Nicole Kidman (as Ada), Philip Seymour Hoffman, Donald Sutherland, Natalie Portman. But above all, the year's best scene stealer was Renee Zellweger, a character straight out of the back-woods to help a bewildered and dainty Ada survive on the farm. The humor and life she brings to the film is enough to lift it from the despair of the rest.There is enough wrong with 'Cold Mountain' to make it a bad film. It is a credit to the fine director and gifted cast that they were able to lift a diamond out of this rough. *** out of ****",Cold Mountain

This film isn't of epic stature, but it turns out i was relieved it wasn't.  It's a love story in the midst of the horrors of war where young men are sent off to fight, deserters are tracked and killed, and the women and children at home are left to fend for themselves while the men are gone.Anyway i thought Nicole Kidman and Rene Zelleweger were pretty decent and not knowing much about Jude Law, he was all right, also.  It seems Rene Z. had the more fun part of the 3 leads and was able to smartly play a spirited, feisty downhome woman with much aplomb.

Also you could easily make your way in the winter when everything is dead but it get deadly cold there. I spent 6 total years of my life in Candler, NC. I've seen it get to -7 there before. Though not normal most days in winter don't get above 42 and stay in the 20s to teens at night for a good 5 months out of the year. People in the South are not friendly to strangers. I'm a CA boy who just happened to be lucky to be the first in my direct line not born in western NC since 1765.

I had never heard of this book but now 18 years later movies about the south, west, civil war etc. Are epic! Tombstone, Young Guns, Turn about Washington's spies in the revolution, even Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter was more entertaining and factual than Cold Mountain.

200,Bgb217,This is why movies are made. Tops my list of 2003.,10,28 December 2003,"`Cold Mountain' may perhaps be the best picture of 2003. In a year of such feats as `The Station Agent' and `The Human Stain'. I think I am coming to realize, that the Civil War epic love story (sounds like it's been done before, doesn't it?) stands in a high place, maybe above those other first two.  You see, `Cold Mountain' is the type of movie that is rather hard to review, as there are aspects of the film and plot that one can't allude to without something being given away; with that I say, if you are an avid movie fan, and think you may want to see this film in any (even small) way, go see this art and experience it for yourself. Each performance in this movie fits into the larger puzzle in pieces, with supporting performers such as Natalie Portman or Donald Sutherland or Philip Seymour Hoffman playing their parts with a certain flawless, true and often brutal, beauty. And so it goes for the leads-each is simply spellbinding. I believe Nicole Kidman to be one of our time's greatest actors, and as Ada, one part of the epic (though unconventional) love story, gives a phenomenal performance; capturing an inexperienced character in love and life in the beginning pieces of the film, and taking that character on an amazing, harsh journey into real life and romance in the face of such terror, through the film's remainder. And Jude Law; I did not know he had this in him. I'd seen very good performances from him in `Road to Perdition' and even `The Talented Mr. Ripley', but as Ada's lover Inman, he blew me away. His accent, look, body language were all perfectly woven together in his character. As is also the case with Renee Zellwegger; of course, given the uneducated attitude one might attribute to a stereotypical `hillbilly' type of her character, it is not hard to see how some would think her performance strictly comic relief. But Ruby, her character, is so much more than all that. She's funny, she's honest, and she feels; she's human. A beauty character-in a beautiful ensemble.  On to the story, which has been called `uneven' by some, for reasons which include every thing to its only having one graphic strictly battle scene in the film's opening (one extremely powerful piece of cinema that effected me in a way I'm not sure I've been touched before) to Inman and Ada's relationship before the war being to brief, to the fact that Inman is a deserter, low-life, traitor of his cause. If you watch `Cold Mountain', and still think that, then I do not know what to tell you. Yes, it is about a deserter; a man who leaves the war he's fighting what is his life's love, for he yearns for life beyond the death of war and no longer wants to support anything such as the brutal ugliness of the Civil War. That is what the whole movie is about, love and life, and the pointlessness of fighting in the extreme ways of war. The story is about the people-not strictly the battle fought on the field, but of the ones fought in the soul-their love, their simplicity, their depth, their comic moments, their tragic moments; as the moments of their lives.  No other film this year has captured me into the state of emotional involvement, also. Though the film is something close to two and a half hours, to me it seemed nothing like the time. It did not seem short, but it was in no way `long'. It was a perfect piece of time during which I experienced some great, involving art. And while you have to see the film to understand the type of love story it is, I can tell you the love story had me entirely swept away (unlike Minghella's other major work ""The English Patient"". The final hour of the film had me, and then, I knew this was a feat of cinematic achievement regardless of the ending, and I let the film take me entirely.  The result was quite possibly one of the greatest movies I've ever seen.
 I highly recommend you go see `Cold Mountain'. A standing ovation from me for director Anthony Minghella, leads Nicole Kidman, Jude Law, and Renee Zellwegger; and all those involved.  Avery large, enthusiastic thumbs up.",Cold Mountain

202,jake j,Weinstein-Miramax Bulldozer Can't Scam This Viewer,1,25 December 2003,"Critics are falling over themselves within the Weinstein's Sphere of Influence to praise this ugly, misguided and repellent adaptation of the lyrical novel on which it's based.  Minghella's ham-fisted direction of the egregiously gory and shrill overly-episodic odyssey is one of the many missteps of this ""civil-war love story"".  Are they kidding?  After Ms. Kidman and Mr. Law meet cute with zero screen chemistry in a small North Carolina town and steal a kiss before its off to war for Jude and his photo souvenir of the girl he left behind, it's a two hour test to the kidneys as to whether he will survive a myriad of near-death experiences to reunite with his soulmate. Who cares?  Philip S. Hoffman's amateurish scene chewing in a disgusting and unfunny role pales to Renee Zelweger's appearance as a corn-fed dynamo who bursts miraculously upon the scene of Kidman's lonely farm to save the day.  Rarely has a performance screamed of ""look at me, I'm acting"" smugness.  Her sheer deafening nerve wakes up the longuers for a couple of minutes until the bluster wears painfully thin.  Released by Miramax strategically for Oscar and Golden Globe (what a farce) consideration, the Weinsteins apparently own, along with Dick Clark, the critical community and won 8 Globe nominations for their overblown failure. The resultant crime is that awards have become meaningless and small, less powerful PR-driven films become obscure.  Cold Mountain is a concept film and an empty, bitter waste of time. Cold indeed!!!",Cold Mountain
203,Sabriane,"Beautiful-looking and compelling in parts, but falls short of greatness",6,2 January 2004,"This film is a sad reminder that an impeccable pedigree does not guarantee an impeccable result. Great cast, a powerful story, amazing cinematography, a director whose previous two films I enjoyed immensely - so why does this movie feel so underwhelming and hollow?Well, the biggest obstacle for me is the central relationship of Inman and Ada. I love Jude Law and Nicole Kidman, but their scenes together are the weakest link that ultimately undoes the chain. In a film where your star-crossed lovers spend most of the time apart, it is crucial that one believes in their love and wishes for them to get back together, and that's just something the film fails to do completely. One could blame the fact that Ada and Inman spend barely any time together before they're torn apart by the war, but when you come down to it I simply felt no chemistry whatsoever between them. There's far more sparkles flying between the characters of Renee Zellwegger and Jack White, for crying out loud.On their own, Law and Kidman fare with varying results. Kidman's Ada turned out to be a far more sympathetic character than I expected her to be, and her growth from a helpless and clueless house plant into a self-sufficient farmer is convincing even if not exactly demanding. Jude Law tries hard to inject some humanity into Inman, but his supposed suffering over the horrors he's seen and done never really rings true.It is also a problem IMO when your main characters are getting constantly upstaged by the far more interesting supporting players. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is fantastic (as always) as a fallen priest who tries to commit a murder. I noticed that people either love or hate Renee Zellwegger's plucky Ruby. For my part I was initially distracted by her over-acting and the way every word comes out of her mouth like a pistol shot, but she definitely injects some energy and no-nonsense humour into the film. It's a flamboyant and showy part that is bound to get awards, but for my money the best supporting moment belongs to Natalie Portman as a single mother struggling to survive all by herself in the woods. The scenes with her are the most poignant and hard-hitting in the film and really make you feel that the horror and cruelties and senseless waste of war is not confined to the battlefields.Unfortunately all this good stuff is not enough to give Cold Mountain a true emotional core, or make it the sweeping epic it clearly strives to be.",Cold Mountain
204,mac-hawk,A valiant attempt but not quite there,7,22 November 2009,"It's initial premise is based on the American Civil War but it's ultimately a love story. We start at the beginning of the war where the main characters (Kidman & Law) are obviously aware of each other and there's an obvious attraction, they have a passionate kiss on the day he leaves for the war. The main thrust of this film is for Law's character to return to Kidman's and his struggles to achieve that and her struggles to survive until he returns. The reason it fails to convince is that we don't see enough of this relationship before Law's character leaves for battle - it's difficult to believe the premise that 2 people yearn for each other so much given they've had so little contact. Everything else is just about fine, Renee Zellweger and her incumbent father and his entourage are lovely additions as is the threat from the gang chasing deserters. Sure it's a long film but it does hold the interest and the cinematography is great. An honourable attempt that doesn't quite make it but worth a watch nonetheless.",Cold Mountain
205,thundrmi,"A Very Good, Almost Great, War Drama",8,25 December 2003,"I have been waiting for the release of Cold Mountain for more than a year, and eagerly attended the first showing on opening day.  My interest was based upon the Civil War theme and my respect for Minghella, Law, Kidman and Zelwegger.  My expectations were largely met, but there were aspects of the film that came up just a little short.What was great about Cold Mountain?  As Ruby (Zelwegger) would say, Number one-  the cinematography.  The initial battle scenes were astonishingly realistic and inspiring.  I have not seen such splendid reenactment since Glory (a favorite film).  Number two- the authentic costumes and set design. Number three- Jude Law's perfectly understated characterization of a war-weary Inman.  Number four- Renee Zelwegger's delightful portrayal of Ruby.  Number five- Nicole Kidman's beauty and grace.All of these splendid facets made this a superior film.  There are a few small details that detracted from its greatness, and here's my short list: number one- the location shooting in Romania works 70% of the time, but the extremely high, sheer-faced and snow-capped mountains are not typical of North Carolina.  number two- the instant attraction of Inman to Ada is part of the plot but needed to be developed just a little more to make the separation more meaningful to the viewer.  number three- being no prude, I have no real objection to nude scenes but they seemed unnecessary in this Victorian-era romance.  Leigh and Gable didn't need to flash breasts and buttocks to make it clear they were about to have intercourse when Rhett swept Scarlett up the staircase in GWTW.  number four- what's with all the animal mutilation? people have to eat but for goodness sake, there's a bull sawed into pieces, a rooster head yanked off and a cute little goat's neck is slashed.  PETA members, be warned. number five (and last)- Civil War history buffs know that the vast majority of casualties at 'the crater' caused at Petersburg were African Americans but this is not evident in the opening battle scene.Overall, Cold Mountain was a terrific dramatic film and certainly deserves the accolades it has received.  I cast an early set of votes for upcoming Oscars as follows:  Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Supporting Actress, Cinematography, Screenplay, Direction, Costume.",Cold Mountain
206,ksundstrom,"Civil War of blood, pain, love fails to reach the heights",5,10 March 2008,"After 630 or so comments what remains to be said? A European view maybe? The film fails. Why? Historically, its so American. 1860 of the civil war was fought primarily between the European immigrants who fled Europe because of the continual wars, social conflicts, poverty that their generations had experienced. The film lacks this perspective. The films from the great directors on war, U.S. and European, avoid the exaggerated dense combat in such a compressed colour spectrum as that of the Cold Mountain, found however in European paintings but nowhere better than in Leonardo da Vinci's Battle of Anghiari. Paintings are not films. Cold Mountain lacks distance, space and battle rhythm that is so well done in Sam Peckinpath's masterpiece Cross of Iron in the other great war films. The love story fails to reach the heights of intense emotion as other U.S. and European war films have done. The acting is good, but no better than many other films of relatively good quality. Strong coherence of a powerful current throughout the film is lacking. Through American eyes the film has nostalgic merit but as an independent work of art in the western world it lacks emotional conviction, and so sadly fails.",Cold Mountain

Until I find myself in possession of this movie, thinking with my luck it's be scar arched and unwatchable, I tried it. Looking back (after watching it) it was a beautiful movie, to say that it was quality in every aspect (not like many movies nowadays). It's a story of love, torn apart by war, life and evil. Through it all, they fight to be with one another. Great characters (except the Joker-like Bosie). A few unnecessary scenes amd lines that take away from the story and potential of its greatness, but other than that it's almost perfection. A movie I'd definitely re-watch, but hesitate to keep.

For the most part, though, the movie moves from pointless gore to meaningless degradation, scene after scene. I understand very well that there are times and places in which that's what life mostly is. And if this movie were an exception to an overload of happy films, who could object? But it is not. It is simply the dramatization of suffering for the purpose of making the rich richer. And we already have plenty of that.",Cold Mountain

The acting mainly carried this film, with superb performances from Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger, as well as the supporting cast. These actors portrayed characters so intensely human that they lingered the remainder of the night with me, and I had trouble shaking this war drama. The costumes and cinematography were also magical, but didn't get carried away with themselves. They didn't take focus, but added to the whole effect. Cold Mountain could never become my favorite movie, as that title will always belong to The English Patient, but it's in the top five. The story itself was well developed, and stayed fairly unpredictable. I did not find myself guessing what line came next. A heart-wrenching story about humanity and war.

212,janne_w,Wonderful heartache,9,12 July 2004,"Judging from the plethora of comments I've seen in the message board, there are lots of folks that loved and hated this movie. I could not have hated it, and not because I am located in the south.I think that Nicole Kidman and Jude Law were perfect for these roles. The romance that the previews promised turned into a longing that I felt with every bit of the woman I am, but it didn't really disappoint me that it wasn't exactly as much a romance as I felt I was led to believe. I hadn't seen or read much about the movie before I saw it, and I'm glad. It was mostly a big surprise all around.Renee Zellweger may just be the actress that stole the movie, but then I think she does that with every movie she appears in. I'll say she was an addition that kept it from becoming morose, for sure. Thankfully she added a bit of wit, whimsy, down home country feelings, which are very much a part of any southern home. Her brutally honest presence in Ada's life gave a feeling of security, even when she was being sarcastic which is often. *smile*The war scenes were difficult to watch and seeing the desperate men that did their best to return home only to be shot down by the home guard hurt... because even though I understand their need to encourage loyalty to the confederacy, surely they had to realize that it was quite fruitless to kill that which you needed so badly - able bodied men! I cannot understand this part of history - meaning, I do not see what benefit it gave the confederacy, and may very well have been one of the reasons the south lost that war so pitifully. So many men deserted that were shot rather than rehabilitated.Anyway, I thought Donald Sutherland was wonderful in his brief role, and think he always lends a classy air to any movie. The ending was bittersweet... the waiting, looking and watching, hoping and praying they both did ended differently than I'd thought it would. I would buy this one and recommend it to anyone.

214,olethrosdc,"Glacially slow, cliched, messy and uninteresting.",4,2 August 2004,"This movie talks about the civil war. The main downfall of the movie are the numerous pointless scenes. Do not get me wrong. In general, I enjoy slow movies - if they are well done. i.e. I loved 'The gaze of Ulysse's' and 'Das Boot', both extremely long movies that tell quite a simple story. However, the longer scenes in those movies aid characterisation and immersion. The scenes in 'Cold mountain' are one of the following types:1. The heroine's voice reciting love letters to her love. 2. Pointless scenes of havoc and violence. 3. Depiction of unbelievable cruelty by the 'villains' 4. The hero wandering around.This is all packaged with very badly thought out characterisations and motifs that follow really trite cliche's.During the course of this overlong movie, nothing is learnt of the protagonists. I felt no empathy for them, or for their quest. The letter-reciting is particularly loathsome and does not add *anything at all* to the movie. Also, no matter how many times you show the hero not letting himself to the pleasures of another woman, or how many times he looks at her picture, it does not make us feel that he loves the heroine.A lot of characters are introduced quite briefly. Given that this movie is so long, it would have been better had the characters been given some more time to develop rather than have all this letter reciting. Maybe it is better that they are not, since all of their lines are just patronising monologues.This movie has no romance, no interest and no soul.",Cold Mountain

218,wrcong,Dull Mountain,5,18 February 2005,"Romance tales are not my cup of tea, but sometimes we do what we have to and go see them anyway. My wife had read the novel and wanted to see the film, so I went along for the Civil War scenes.I am a Civil War buff. I have tromped around on battlefields, visited Lincoln sites and toured museums. I've read most of the best of what is out there to be read on the subject, and I have to say, Anothnoy Minghella admirably captured the battle scenes depicting the slaughter in the ""crater"" portion of the battle of Cold Harbor. He also displayed a deft touch with the more subtle concept that by 1864, the Confederate army were becoming increasingly disenchanted at the idea that they could win the war.Consequently, many did simply head for home, hoping that there was still a home to get to when they got there. Those are the two things Minghella did very well. That's where he earned most of the five points on the IMDb scale that I gave this film.Beyond that, this movie seemed to take days to tell a story that can be summed up in three sentences. Inman (Jude Law) is fed up with the war and wants to go hone and consummate his love for Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman). On the way he encounters hardships, acts of courage, acts of cowardice and the like while Ada battles with the help of some unlikely allies to keep from dying herself. Finally Inman gets home, makes to love Ada, and then he dies.Jude Law turned in a credible performance as the soldiers' soldier, Inman. Renee Zellweger was entertaining as Ada's friend and companion (lover?) Ruby Thewes. Phillip Seymour Hoffman turned in a nice performance as the cad, Rev. Veasey. Otherwise the performances were certainly not horrible; the cast was solid and portrayed the broad brush characters they were given to portray with reliable predictability. As for Nicole Kidman, I never for a moment believed that she was on the brink of starvation after her father (portrayed with a kind of bemused indifference by Donald Suterland) died. People on the brink of starvation are not perfectly groomed with meticulously combed hair, fluorescent white teeth and not a callous on her hands. I suppose it's not her fault that that the director and make-up people were unable to suppress her natural beauty, but she never looked to be suffering from anything more than mild discomfort. As is often the case with ""Hollywood"" productions, the people are just a little too pretty to be believed.The whole purpose of the movie seemed to be to get to the torrid love scene between Inman and Ada, followed hard by his death. I hope the journey was worth it for Inman; it certainly wasn't for me.",Cold Mountain
219,WheezyJoe,Misery Mountain,7,13 January 2004,"Adapted from the much-loved novel by Charles Frazier, `Cold Mountain' has been a welcome arrival to the big screen. Acclaimed director/screenwriter Anthony Minghella, thankfully, has taken on the responsibility of bringing forth the tangled story of love and war to a visual reality. May it be war on an epic scale or war on a personal level Minghella knows precisely how to capture the moment. And even with the abundance of splendid scene-scapes and backdrops spread throughout the film the key achievement `Cold Mountain' exhibits is the emotion and passion harnessed within the characters.Clearly the heart of the story is one that viewers are more than familiar with. Hope, loss and love, all up against overwhelming odds, it's hardly original. But, you will find satisfaction by being able to identify with the emotional quandary of these characters. Once you get to know them you slip into the story and enjoy yourself all the more. But Minghella has some trouble getting you there. The movie starts off slowly as exposition and character development is needed to boost the rest of the film. It's all stuff that is essentially needed but it's just a little dreary at times. On top of that the need to get closer to true history means that the tone gets quite depressing. This is only strengthened by the characters who the majority are driven by a sad coating of misery, sin or defeat in their lives. Then add the Confederacy losing the war and you don't have a very happy place to be. Make no mistake about it Minghella has made a serious drama with a somewhat relaxed momentum in the telling. But if it's authenticity that he wanted then he has done a marvelous job. It's just that, in this case, reality can really bring you down.Performances are all A-class. The two leads, Nicole Kidman as Ada and Jude Law as Inman, are truly great actors. The roles themselves are not the best we've seen but they work well within context of the story. Renée Zellweger's character, Ruby, strikes a sudden change to the pace and grim guise the rest of the movie holds. I found myself liking all of Ruby's scenes but am still trying to figure out if it's because she's the inversion of an overly dim film or because she just sticks out like a sore thumb. Either way I think the film would have probably fell completely stagnate if it weren't for Zellweger's lively portrayal.`Cold Mountain' is not exactly Anthony Minghella's greatest effort but definitely one of his finest. This is a great story made with tremendous care by a large handful of master filmmakers. It's a little bleak and sluggish for most of the time but done in reflection to the literary source and the authenticity of the story. Ironically, it's hard to imagine it done in any other way. Despite some minor announces you will have a hard time not enjoying yourself. In the end this is a good entertaining few hours. I'd even go as far as saying it's a must see film, because you really must see it to make your own judgment.Score - 3 out of 5",Cold Mountain

Renee was good, but it is not her best role. In my opinion Shoheren (spelling) did a better job.

Her transformation from delicate Southern belle to strong survivor is notably strong.Renee Zellweger steals the film with her plucky and sassy Ruby Thewes.

I usually am deeply disappointed when I see a movie based on a book I've read.  Not this time!!!  This is a 2.5 hour plus movie, and not once did I look at my watch.  Anthony Minghella beautifully captured the feeling of the book, which is a somewhat surrealistic journey for Inman through all of the faces of evil temptation and a test of his inner strength and determination.  It also captures the trials of Ada as she struggles to learn to become useful in spite of her sheltered upbringing, and to hold onto her belief that Inman will return, and to overcome the dark designs of the local ""home guard"" soldiers.

The opening sequence of jumping forward and backward in the story's time- line was fine but went no where.  The interesting ""play"" on practically being mute by choice for Law's character looked like a good concept but what should have been a critical symbol and foreshadowing is used miserably with litteimpact / connection to the characters that do lose their voices (literally or metaphorically) later in the film.  The screenplay weaknesses do not stop there.  Frankly, the dialogue wasweak.  Only one of the characters had strong dialog, and compelling speeches. With the exception of a well-acted character by Renee Zelleweger, the dialogue was simply not worth listening to.  The Cinematography and editing was effective enough, and the costume/ design, while not worthy of awards, was realistic.  In short, the film looked o.k. and was cohesive. But that is it.     Kidman, Law, and an impressive supporting cast did well [with what they were given] but it was obviously that the entire cast [but Zelleweger] was starving for lines.  What a waste of talent.

There are flaws to this movie, but they don't drag it down into a quagmire of mediocrity.First, the good Renée Zellweger is brilliantly cast as the crotchety (and all the more lovable because of it) Ruby Thewes. She is a strong woman (which is immensely tantalizing to begin with), competent, and independent.

She is completely believable in the part. You might wonder if she could pull off going from the charming southern belle with nary a marketable skill to an independent, functional, and prosperous farm owner, but there it is.The cinematography gets a nod as well. Good location work and visuals.Now for the bad This movie is at least half an hour too long. It wanders, repeatedly, away from the point and seems to forget where it's trying to go. Better editing could have made this movie top-notch, but not enough of it found its way to the cutting room floor. The excessive length and meandering plot are a serious detraction from the overall quality of the film, preventing a higher score, but the core of the movie is reasonably solid, so I can't knock it TOO badly.6.5 (maybe a 7) out of 10.",Cold Mountain

Didn't look it.  She is so breathtakingly beautiful.  Renee is so funny and spunky. Lots of oddball characters and B list star cameos.  My favorite was Natalie Portman in a heartbreaking performance.  Best war battle scene of 2003 ( the turkey shoot in the bomb crater ).  I didn't think Minghella had it in him to display such intense, in-your-face carnage.  Return of the King battle scenes come in a distant 2nd to this ferocity.  The movie's ending had me crying like a woman.  Easily one of my favorite movies of 2003.  Thanks for reading.  Bye.",Cold Mountain

228,Foxterrier,wow! - powerful and involving,9,1 January 2004,"Wow, what a movie! After ""Chicago"" last year, Miramax has done it again. Come Oscar time, look for Cold Mountain to get plenty of nominations - and hopefully a gold statue for Rene Zellwegger.Roger Ebert has criticized Jude Law's and Nicole Kidman's characters as being like islands, complete unto themselves. I agree; while the two are talking, you just about want to grab them and say, ""oh come on you two, start smooching already!"" But if they're islands, what islands they are. ""Inman"" is, on one hand, a man so gentle he can catch birds with his bare hands, but also a cunning warrior who will kill when he has to. ""Ada"" is an upperclass lady who falls on horrible times, and does what she must to survive. Yet nevertheless she remains a lady, with skin that never loses its  soft pearlescent glow.Rene Zellwegger - wow, can you imagine anyone more perfect for this part! I loved ""Ruby's"" outspoken words and manner. Yet Ruby and Ada hit it off like sisters. Their chemistry is delightful, and you sense they're having fun. Rene's chemistry with musician Jack White is also tangible, and a closing scene involving children may be prophetic. There is some VERY beautiful photography in this. There is also a lot of blood. As with ""Master and Commander,"" the fighting is often point-blank and frightfully realistic. Several good people die. (Several bad people die too, happily, but still....ewwww!) Funny how you can see three James Bond films in a row and never blink an eye, and then you see this and just about reach for a glass of water. My only other complaint with Cold Mountain has to do with a love scene between the lead characters. I find it too graphic, and out of harmony with the rest of the film. Inman's and Ada's love is built on faith, promises and high ideals. Likewise then, their love making should have been romantic, idealized and cloaked with mystery. Frankly, it seemed like the director or somebody wanted a sex scene, so okay, they did a sex scene. Ugh. In contrast, the sex that happens earlier in the movie suits the primal nature of those characters and that situation. It seems funny to say this, but in this context, I did not want to see close-ups of Nicole Kidman's tush. Whatever. Nine out of ten is still an awfully good film. Enjoy it!",Cold Mountain

Renee actually ""stole"" the movie, and most certainly was deserving of the Academy Award. It was brutal, it was tender and, it was one of the best motion pictures I have seen.

230,rominaferraro,Not good enough,5,5 February 2005,"I was really disappointed in this movie. First of all, it's really long. I'm not saying that I can't enjoy a movie for more than an hour and a half, but the fact that the journey is an ordeal for the Jude Law character doesn't mean that it has to be an ordeal for the viewer too. I've seen long movies before, but these succeeded in keeping the viewer interested. That wasn't my feeling with ""Cold Mountain"".The end was a downer too. It was a complete cliché. (SPOILER) I can't stand another movie in which the hero comes back and has sex with the heroine just once, only to die afterwards. And, of course, she gets pregnant! I'm starting to think that waiting for your lover for a long time, having sex with him and having him killed is an excellent method to improve fertility.What disappointed me the most was that, in fact, the actors did a very good job. And, besides the clichés, the script depicts certain aspects of the war that are not usually shown, like the role of women or the cruelty away from the battlefield. I have the impression that these aspects were treated quite realistically, and that emphasizes the contrast with the glurge in the end.I have to admit that, in terms of music and photography, it is a really beautiful movie. Nevertheless, that's not enough to make it a great movie.That's what annoyed me so much: with great resources, Minghella didn't make a great movie.",Cold Mountain

And indeed, it could have been good. But this isn't.The director seems to have decided, for one thing, that the best way to make the audience really feel the passage of three years is to keep them in the theater for as significant a fraction of that time as possible. The book this movie is based on is about 350 pages long. About two-thirds of the way through the movie, I began to feel like I was in for a page-per-minute interpretation.As little regard as I have for her, I must confess that Renee Zellweger is the only reason to see this movie. Her comic relief, in addition to being much needed, is wonderfully done, and she comes closest to having anything like an accurate dialect.If you've heard like I did that this film got snubbed for Oscar nominations because (a) Nicole looks too glamorous or (b) it was filmed in Europe instead of on location in North Carolina, let me assure you: there are hundreds and hundreds of good reasons this movie didn't get more nominations. You can count them on your watch.Original grade: 6 out of 10, 1 mark above ""never should have been made""Revised grade (3/7/2012): 4 out of 10. Bad.

Unfortunately, this film is so depressing there is no entertainment value. In a word, Blech!Even illiterates involved in the Civil War had clearly understood at least the basic reasons they were fighting.  Both sides had concrete and heart-felt convictions to the last man.  There is no excuse for painting it as a Vietnam style political fiasco-- even allowing that over simplistic view of Vietnam-- other than outright ignorance or a desire to revise public perception of what really happened.  Read a book, people!Hollywood's obsession with antichristian themes is annoyingly prevailant these days, but here we have a blatant case of malicious slander against anything related to church, even though the moral influences of christians in general played an enormous role in America's growth and stability, and particularly in Abe Lincoln's resolve to follow moral issues rather than political ones in fighting the Civil War, to the ongoing benefit of African-Americans and the United States overall.

Unfortunately the trailer contained ALL the best scenes from this extremely long movie! I wasn't aware of that & naively thought, the movie could offer me something more.What I totally hated is that there was ONLY ONE battle scene in the movie!!! The one which was going on for something like 5 minutes & was shown in the trailer! Yep, no more battle scenes for the entire 2 & half hour movie about the civil war! What the hell? Is Miramax in such bad financial state? Couldn't it have afforded battle scenes or what?Apparently most of the money was spent on the actors' salaries. Yeah, money well spent, since most actors in this movie couldn't do the most important thing - portray credible characters! Yeah, they were all wonderful at moaning, whining, crying & expressing different emotions. But did they manage to make us viewers believe that depicted characters could have existed in real? NO! The acting was very emotional in the beginning & got simply pathetic by the end of the flick. The only one, who's done her job well was Renee Zellweger!!! Her acting was awesome & it was the ONLY thing I enjoyed about Cold Mountain!!!The movie is based on the book, which I haven't read, so maybe I ain't gonna be very fair. But to me the story seemed to be quite sappy. It featured some goofs & stupid plot lines. It would be OK, if the actors were able to play believably, but they couldn't & all the flaws became evident to the viewers.Maybe the direction is to be blamed on such far-fetched performance. The movie focuses too much on emotions, but it sometimes doesn't make sense. Apparently, the idea was to show the misery of civil citizens, who suffered the terrible consequences of war. The director failed to do this. The main character is running through the woods & swamps occasionally coming across some civil personages, who are mostly weird & don't meet sympathy from viewers.To sum up, the flick appeared a far-fetched, pathetic,unpatriotic, cheap anti-war crap to me. And if to be honest, I felt some compassion towards the characters in the beginning, but by the end of it I could care less, because of terrible direction & over-acting. The movie has some clear anti-war trend, but it seems ludicrous, cause the war itself wasn't even shown well enough .According to the trailer, it was gonna be an uplifting patriotic film with vivid breathtaking battle scenes. In real, it sucked. I got punk'd. But I guess, it was my fault. I should have read the book at first.P.S.: Harvey what Oscar award are you talking about?

235,kennyevans,Solid Acting-An Excellent Portrayal of mid 19th Century America,8,5 March 2007,"I really enjoyed this film. It was about time Anthony Minghella had the success he so justly deserves after making some fairly good films throughout his career, most notably Truly Madly Deeply and the English Patient. Strange though that a thoroughly English director should take on a staunchly American subject and then also fill the main roles with a host of Non American actors. I can't vouch for the authenticity of accents, but the main characters did a fantastic job. I loved Winstone, you could even smell him, such was his menacing presence. Natalie Portman also did a great job in what was only a fleeting role in the film.The battle scenes were brutal and I think well researched and recreated based on my knowledge of the American Civil War. It really plunged you into the horror and chaos of warfare in that era with muck and bullets abound.The central story of Law and Kidmans character was strange in that it was based entirely on voice overs and the odd look or sigh from the characters. Apart from a brief period at both the start and the end of the film, the two just spent the time longing and it's clear that their love for each other is what helped them through their individual struggles as Law recovers from serious war injuries and Kidman tries to cope with running a farm on her own.What I thought was also good about this film was the sense of suspense and empathy for the characters, built up through some excellent development. I genuinely thought Minghella might kill off any character at any given time and I was not certain that the plot would converge as it would normally. The shock shootings of Zelweggers father and the retarded musician were among the many twists and turns that kept the audience unsure of the outcome. However the plot did converge as you would expect but even then Minghella handled the reunion with 'real world' strategy and we don't see the pair running together in slow motion into an obvious camera flying around them, embrace. Instead we see what would have been more probable at the time and the period. A very conservative reunion with the bed scenes saved for later and executed very tastefully.I loved the way the whole vibe of 19th century America was portrayed and it was the setting that really embedded the characters as much as anything. The hardship, the realities, everything was masterfully put together. Right down to the fantastic costumes, it was a winner for me. Zelwegger did steal the show and I couldn't help but think how rugged and weathered she looked. Either good make up, or she was hitting the drink during production! A tragic yet happy ending and for me a great film.",Cold Mountain
236,igmu,Definitely worth a look.,8,18 January 2006,"I haven't seen this film for about a year, but something brought it to mind. I decided to browse the comments here and am most surprised, especially by some of the negative ones.Two of the most laughable are that a) Jude Law's acting performance was very wooden and b) there are two many non-American actors in the film.a) Jude Law IS one of the most wooden actors ever, and in my view is normally dreadful in all that he does. However, in this film his character, Inman, is one of the most dull individuals ever realised on film, and Law is ideally cast as the shy, boring, monosyllabic carpenter. He fitted the role perfectly.b) What the critics who moan about the use of non-American actors forget is that the USA is a land of immigrants, and that the likelihood of people speaking with a not quite perfect 'southern' accent was very high in the melting pot of the 19th century. Granted, I don't suppose that there were too many Australian immigrants ;), but that shouldn't be held against Ms Kidman who does a fine job with most parts that she takes on.The film itself? It is not the greatest thing since sliced bread that some people believe, neither is it the boring rubbish described by others. I found it an engrossing story that, although episodic, held my attention for the whole two and a half hours. The story was well told and visually it looked good; the only reservation I have is that of the character played by Ray Winstone, which grated somewhat.Overall, well worth seeing. 8/10.",Cold Mountain
237,Red66,"Law Soars, Kidman miscast.",7,19 January 2004,"WARNING: SPOILERS AHEAD! The main aspect of ""Cold Mountain"" that resonates with me isJude Law's haunting performance. For most of the film, Law isrequired to act with just his face and he conveys much complexemotion and turmoil within his eyes. I was again reminded of whata truly splendid actor Mr. Law is. It's so easy to get caught up in hisequally splendid beauty and forget that he is certainly one of thetop five best young actors of today. The only problem is that thereis absolutely ZERO chemistry between Law and Nicole Kidman,which makes the film's central love story fall flat on it's face.Kidman is fine--she's pretty much on auto pilot, which, even forher, is far more compelling than most of her contemporaries. But,it's impossible to believe her agony and struggle over the man sheloves, when you aren't convinced she actually loves him. Plus,she's too old for the role. Natalie Portman would have made amore believable  virginal daughter of a minister (in fact, Portmancontributes a compelling cameo). Law is on the borderline ofbeing too old as well, but he can pass for a man in hislate-twenties. Also, to nit pick--how could starving, unwashedpeople from the 1860's have such perfect white teeth? Every timeLaw smiles through his bearded dirty visage and flashed thosepearly whites, I just thought of modern dentistry. At least knock thecolor down a shade or two. In the cameo department (whichcomes close to a ""Love Boat"" episode), Phillip Seymour Hoffmanis exquisite--deserves an Oscar nod as usual; Zellwegercontinues to proves herself and steals every scene from Kidman;and, once you get use to the bad wig, Charlie Hunnam issurprisingly up for his deliciously evil role. This boy may havesome range. The cinematography is gorgeous and the artdirection is spot on. Overall, the film is enjoyable and offers somegreat performances. But it is the miscasting of Kidman that keepsthe film from truly soaring.

I think it is beautifully filmed and the story is OK but the characters make it. I particularly like the smaller characters as played by Brendan Gleeson, Renee Zellweger and Philip Seymour Hoffman is, as always, amazing. The two female leads are actors that annoy me as much as they impress me but have most definitely impressed this time around. The one problem I speak of is Jude Law. There are any number of great actors that could have played the part and they wouldn't have even had to fake an accent. By no measure does he ruin the film and actually does a good job through most of the film. It's when he and the Nicole Kidman character aren't going at it that the relationship is farcical. Their debates as to whether they are behaving appropriately as a couple and their attempts to outdo one another in the ""most poetic expression of love"" competition were unnecessary.The casting was great but almost unnecessary. As was the marketing ploy of the bit part player Jack White, who performs the musical parts well but acts badly. Other personnel include Cillian Murphy, Natalie Portman and Giovanni Ribisi who do really well but, again in bit parts. Ray Winstone is unrecognisable as ""the baddie"" and plays the part really well.

241,jordanbeaver,Barely Watchable for the first 30min,4,17 May 2006,"This film could have been a much more reasonable 2 hours in duration, if only they had made the decision to sum up the boring first 30 minutes into a 2 minute narrative.Until Zellweger appeared, I was ready to gouge my eyes out. The first clue that this was going to be a rough 154 minutes was when our main characters opened their mouths for the first time. Wow, you'd think that if you're going to shoot your film in Eastern Europe, throwing an Australian and an Englishman into your lead roles is pushing it too far. Those were, hands down, the worst attempts at southern accents I've ever heard. I really like Law and Kidman, but they just couldn't pull off 19th century Southern if they were sitting on a front porch fanning themselves while eating pecan pie and listening to a conversation about the rising costs of negros.Zellweger's characterizations were great. She was a little to impolite to be a southerner, but the overall spirit she got right.Hoffman's brief stint in the film was wonderful and I was ready to rate this film a 9, until he was killed off. It's too bad Hoffman doesn't weigh 40lbs less, he would make a fabulous Inman.Portman provided an impeccable performance, but again, for too short a period.At one point Inman mentions that it's a long way to the Blue Ridge.. unfortunately for him, he wasn't actually going to the Blue Ridge since Cold Mountain is mentioned to be in Haywood County. During the Civil War, Haywood County was much larger than present day Haywood County, but still didn't encompass any of the Blue Ridge. Of course, this may explain why the movie was so long.. Jude never stopped to ask for directions.In the end, this movie just gave me a very hollow feeling. Hollow actors in the lead roles, hollow story with holes at the edges, and a hollow love story that ended in horribly done movie-kisses that looked like two large goldfish trying to swim around in too small a tank.I'd give it a 9 or 10 if only they had cut it down to just the secondary characters, which were exceedingly watchable.",Cold Mountain

The main fault lies with the screenplay. Whatever charms the novel might have held were mostly lost in the translation. Supporting characters never stick around long enough to justify their presence - the hermit lady who heals Inman, for instance, adds nothing to the story line or theme that is not added elsewhere. With sparse dialogue and introverted main characters the script fails to invent ways to reveal their inner lives in ways that we really care about. And after 2.5 hours we really should care what befalls them at the end. Despite the massive promotion as the year's masterpiece the film just doesn't deliver the goods, and, to their rare credit, most critics and Academy members were able to see that behind all that sizzle there wasn't a whole lot of meat.

He seems very natural in the skin of a southern man. The love scenes are very well done and very beautiful, the chemistry between them is electric.But it's a rather long and boring movie, with many unnecessary sub plots and annoying characters, like the priest and his strange habits, (at least for a ""man of God"" anyway as he calls himself).The self appointed home-guard is also quite good, being true to their call: nasty, cruel and relentless, if not contradicting!

The production, the direction and the acting are greater than the sum of their parts. The camera work, the editing, the costumes and ESPECIALLY the sets get top marks. The script is good.The Actors are great, save a small caveat. Some (not all) of the bad guys (and there are lots of bad guys in this movie) play the heavy a little too heavy. Not over the top, but just a little too mean AND evil at the same time, you know? Part of that probably comes from the way the characters and their actions were written in the original novel, and some of it comes from the age old problem of basically decent human beings playing (and directing) the role of sick, demented, evil human beings, and not really having anything in their own life experiences to base something like that on. I am not referring to Ray Winstones performance as Teague, I thought he was great. Very believable that you can dislike someone without being able to put your finger on why at first. A real trick to play that character and have the audience feel the distrust without the words and/or actions to substantiate that emotion.There isn't a female actor in this movie that doesn't do an OUTSTANDING job. Nicole Kidman is stunning, she has never been more attractive than in Cold Mountain. Renee Zellweger is brilliant.

251,philip-63,"Slow, slow, quick, quick, SLOW",3,9 January 2004,"There's a certain amount of nice scenic photography in this film. The mountains in winter look good from a helicopter. There is some rather horrible gore at the beginning, during the civil war battle. The rest is like ""The Outlaw Josey Whales"" without pace and without Eastwood's charisma. Just when you think the action may pick up, we get another softly-spoken, dirge-like voice-over from Nicole Kidman. Jude Law makes little impression in the lead male role. He is monosyllabic, and comes over as too lightweight for the 'epic' tale he is obliged to carry. Overall, the action is fatally episodic and the script WAY TOO LONG. Someone should have told Mingella to get busy with the blue pencil, but I guess he is too big a fish these days for that to happen. Pity. In the hands of a more dynamic director/writer it could have been good.",Cold Mountain
252,spaceboy_a,This is why I go to the movies - NOT FOR ESCAPISM...,8,5 January 2004,"After all the fuss over 'Lord of the Rings' and everything else out over the the Christmas period - you know all the films that people see in droves to try and escape from their reality? It was so nice to see 'Cold Mountain' a couple of days ago.Yes it's pretty morbid but does have touches of humour. And when you have a great lead cast and an amazing supporting cast giving some very strong performances, plus some lush cinematography and a compelling story, how can you complain?I like the fact that there's something deeper happening here with the characters other than the love story. But unlike 'Titanic', 'Cold Mountain' isn't a Hollywood love story, it's a story about survival and Law and Kidman are very convincing here - they also heat up the screen too towards the end. Plus Kathy Baker, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Jena Melone (in a very small role), Natalie Portman (reminding us after 2 'Star Wars' films that she CAN act) and Rene Zellwegger, I came out full filled. This is a film about 'us' and anyone who says it's too bloody needs a reality check because this is what life was like and for all we know could be like it again some day.I don't think anyone will come out of 'Cold Mountain' saying, ""that was just a bit of fun... harmless entertainment"" but I think it's impossible to come out thinking that you haven't just seen a film of very high quality both in production values and in terms of story. If you want your movies sugar coated, then by all means, go spend another 3 hours and see 'Return of the King' again.If you didn't like 'The English Patient' or 'The Talented Mr. Ripley', then you might not like this film as all three are by the same writer/director, but if you enjoy seeing some real characters in real situations, this movie could be what you're looking for.8 OUT OF 10",Cold Mountain

I really enjoyed the comic moments with Renee Zellweger and Philip Seymour Hoffman.  They were hilarious!I would recommend this movie if you're in the mood for a deeply touching love story.

They've been pushing Cold Mountain down the public's throat for quite a while.  My only question is: Will they refund me the $10 for two matinee tickets, $13 of refreshments, and time spent traveling to, sitting through, and racing home from this piece of garbage??? They did just enough Civil War research to learn how to spell ""war."" As an avid student of the time period, I was horribly disappointed by their parade of inaccuracy.  They present battle scenes unlike those ever witnessed during the 1860s, because their film crew had no apparent clue about Civil War battles and tactics.  It is no small wonder that they had to retreat filming overseas.  They had hoped that re-enactors would give their time and effort to this work, as they had done so for ""Gettysburg"" and ""Gods and Generals.""  Not a single living historian of the Civil War was willing to be associated with this drivel, and now, having seen it, I understand why. One is hard pressed, indeed, to find anything historically accurate, emotionally moving, or socially redeeming in this utter affront to the hundreds of thousands who died during the American Civil War.  This film wants so badly to be on par with ""Gone with the Wind.""  It would have trouble matching up intellectually with ""South Park"" or ""Freddy vs. Jason."" Don't be suckered in.

All the letters she wrote , they were for him and for herself , to help her hold on and to not lose faith. And can you believe in a man who tries to get to her to her for only one day, or maybe less, and the day which may never really come? And the way the story ended is the only one possible. Inman could kill the man who shot him in he end, even without talking to him ,and Ada could give up, find herself someone else or merely get insane, but they two have met - through the horror of war , despite people's meanness - they've met and had the happiest moments in their lives, those moments which never last forever.",Cold Mountain

Is this a historically correct, Oscar winning masterpiece that filmsyidents will be studying in a 100 year...no. But that is the worst that Can be said about it. Nicole Kidman and Renee zelwegger make a delightful couple of misfits off the opposite end. They bring humor in what would otherwise be a tearjecking tragedy. The romance is believable if you consider the lack of choice and the hard times. It is a realistic portrait of war. There is a moral about how harsh conditions bring out the best and worst in people. It is not a happy end and yet it is. The photography is beautiful yet gruesome. So why do I call this ' just a nice movie'? Because it doesn't go to extremes. The acting is good but not perfect, the story works and has a good tempo but is not mind blowing. The photography is beautifull but not sophisticated. There is a moral but it doesn't break down any doors. It is a well balanced, easy going, beautifully directed movie that has you engaged but not on the edge of your seat.

258,erialc,The love epic of the year,8,26 December 2003,"Having read a great deal about the film during its production, I have to admit that Cold Mountain was my most anticipated movie of the year. Now, having finally seen it, I'm pleased to say that not only did it live up to my expectations; it has exceeded them in many occasions.
Through its portrayal of the brutality of war, Cold Mountain more importantly conveys a powerful love story that transcends distance.Aside from the breathtaking cinematography that takes us into the world of Cold Mountain, director Anthony Minghella yet again managed to assemble such a group of talents as his leading characters. Because so many have already commented on the scene-stealing performance given by Renee Zellweger, let us focus on the other two, more subdued, performances given by Jude Law and Nicole Kidman. We should observe things from a different perspective. Unlike Ruby, Inman and Ada are much more introverted. They do not easily reveal their emotions through gesture or speech; instead, they most often communicate silently through their eyes that convey the sense of hope, of despair, and most importantly of love.In addition, worth mentioning is that even though the two lovers, separated by war, are not to be seen in the same scene for the majority of the film, Minghella, through his juxtaposition of certain scenes, hints a sense of an emotional interaction between Inman and Ada. These poignant yet subtle details are what convince the audience of the reality and the passions of the love between these two characters.",Cold Mountain

It is atmospheric, beautifully filmed (in a beautiful part of the world) and combines a war film with a love story, with other elements thrown in. It is also important in illustrating just how grim the American Civil War was, at the front or on the 'home front'. Although Rene Zellweger won the most acclaim, I actually think Jude Law steals the acting with his portrayal of a thoroughly honourable 'southern boy' soldier torn between his desire to do his duty to his state and his love (Nicole Kidman). Where light relief is needed the brilliant and versatile Philip Seymour Hoffman provides it as 'the Reverend', not to mention Brendan Gleeson as the musician father to Rene's character - though it is never over-done. On the darker side Ray Winstone and his extremely sinister albino side-kick (Charlie Hunnam) provide the menace. Together with a superb soundtrack I would rate this as a timeless classic to be enjoyed in DVD collections for many years to come.",Cold Mountain

Though given the epic treatment the book deserves I'm afraid the film does not have the same emotional impact.  The casting seems to have gone somewhat awry. Inman (Law) should have been a rugged giant and required a more mature actor with more presence. Ada (Kidman)should have been prettier and of even higher social grace, making her even more vulnerable. Zellewegger as Ruby was OK, but her character should have been less comedic and more down to earth.Having said that, the performances were OK, but the screenplay left a lot to be desired. Inmans' journey was a series of separate scenes that didn't flow very well. Adas' struggle should have been harder.  In the end the viewer just didn't have the emotional tie to the characters that made the book so outstanding.At the end of the book I found myself screaming ""No"" at the pages, at the end of the film I found myself groaning ""No"" at the screen.5 out of 10",Cold Mountain

While most films give us a view of the Union side of the war this gives us the opposite, showing that war brings out the worst in everyone but also their best.  Jude Law and Nicole Kidman were good, however I may question the casting of an Aussie to play a southern belle.  Anyway the truly great performance was given by Renee Zellweger.  I base a great performance on whether or not the actor can make you forget about anything else they have ever done (such as Tom Hanks in ""Forrest Gump"") and she did this.  This should ensure Miss Zellweger a Best Supporting Actress Oscar nomination, her third nomination in as many years I might add.

It would be one thing if the production had allowed all the other actors to remain clean and perfect, too, but she was the only one who didn't get messy. There was never even a smudge on her powdered cheek. Are we to believe she was the only person in the Civil War with a bathtub and a mirror? She certainly looked like the only one who used them. Tweezers, too; I mean, what's with those eyebrows? She looked absolutely mean!The love story was implausible.

278,sazo-2,Love triumphs over any suffering,8,26 January 2006,"Although I haven't read the book, it became obvious that the film's screenplay has origins from literature. Many novels, poems written on diverse languages have at their basis the topic of fighting and suffering for love. This is the essence of the film. The rest is detail. But these detail differentiate it from other films. The age, the natural surroundings, the supporting actors are also chosen carefully, distinguishing the film from the majority.It is the age of the Civil War. A wounded soldier begins his journey back home to Cold Mountain, North Carolina to reunite with his love. Their love is pure, idyllic. The whole journey is also fabulous, he gets in amazing situations encountering evil and good. Meanwhile his love meets her own problems at home in the lean and dire days of the war.The acting is very good. I won't comment it in detail, I am sure others did, anyway the names and nominations speak for themselves. The scenes filmed in Romania near Brasov are beautiful, although I'm sure there are differences between the Carpatians and the Appalacian Mountains. The costumes and make-ups are good, the filmmakers even manage to make the audience forget about the fact that Kidman and Zellweger are film stars. This is not the usual romance story. Violent sometimes naturalistic scenes are mixed with romantic scenes. There are people, loving romantic movies, who consider it too violent at some places, others consider it too romantic.

279,unitythroughterror,A flawed film indeed,8,25 June 2014,"It's good for what it is, but Cold Mountain eradicates a lot of things that made Charles Frazier's novel more grounded. There is barely any attention paid to the slavery and atrocities that made the South so hell-like for those unfortunate to be born and sold into slavery. Inman is never shown to be remorseful except once (""I don't want to fight for a cause I don't believe in"") but there is nothing more shown for that. He is portrayed as a pretty vapid, shallow mystery man of few words and even fewer perceptive thoughts. This works, and it makes his heroism all the better because of its stark contrast to his otherwise nondescript character. Renee Zellweger does a fine job as Ruby, and really is the heart and soul of this film. Nicole Kidman is excellent as always, although almost too otherworldly as a presence to be perceived as a riches-to-rags girl from the city. It makes her a joy to watch, though. Charlie Hunnam really steals the show with the few scenes he's in as a reinvention of Birch, this time around named Bosie, an albino with a hobby of inflicting serious pain on unlucky victims. Ray Winstone is effective as Teague, although he always plays sleazy, sneaky villains so this is no exception. The battle scenes and violent moments in the film are the most effective parts of the film. They really draw you in, and although are nowhere near as graphic or realistically gory as Saving Private Ryan (indeed, I would have appreciated more gore for realism's sake, people get gunned down and they have no wounds or blood sometimes) the drama is truly jarring as we see humanity at its very worst (boys and men being killed in the blink of an eye, stepped on, and crushed). The torture of Sally Swanger (Kathy Baker) is also an effective look at the brutality of the home guard, these scenes really work because the violence - although lacking in realism at times - is still well played in terms of shaking you up and reminding you times are grim. All in all, the emotional scenes are beautiful (if not a little hammy), the supernatural elements effective, the battle scenes excellent, the photography beautiful, and the performances more or less right on target. It's one of those trendy ""epic violent movies"" of 2003, which seemed like a real hot year for violent, fast-paced epic movies. Check it out, but don't expect a masterpiece of modern cinema. But it definitely hits the mark in a way that few filmmakers can do.",Cold Mountain

In reading some of the external reviews for this movie there seems to be universal praise for Renee Zellweger's performance and I would agree.  There also seems to be some disappointment in the fact that the two main stars are separated throughout the movie and in this I disagree.  Whereas the detractors seem upset that the movie was supposed to be a great love story, I never took it for that.  It was true that the two main protangonists are infatuated with each other in the beginning, how can that be mistaken for love.  However, each becomes the symbol to the other of the way they want the world to be and not the daily horror the war has made it.  It is clear from the beginning that Inman's home coming is going to be long delayed, and that the story is each protagonists' reaction to the war and how they managed to survived it.",Cold Mountain

Renee Zelwegger was brilliant and Jude Law was very good too.What put me off was that this movie seems almost designed to win over Oscar voters (and I'm surprised it did not). Take a typically american theme, add equal parts of the brutal and the beautiful, throw in some romance - a movie by the numbers.Another big minus was the lack of chemistry between Law and Kidman.

What we have is a loose re-telling of ""The Odyssey"" set in the Civil War. The long journey to returned to a loved one and overcoming the obstacles to get there are right out of The Odyssey. Even the sirens are in this story. This is a classic formula for good storytelling. The protagonist (played by Jude Law) has a literal journey in this film, but he failed in having his inner journey. The character is rather flat and doesn't change much. It is implied that he is changed, but I just felt Jude Law didn't portray that change well.Here's where I will demonstrate unpopular opinion...Renee Zellweger. Everyone raves about her performance and how she ""stole the show"", how great she is, her best performance, bla, bla, bla. I completely disagree. Sure, she stole the show, but it was with a completely campy, over-the-top, almost cartoon performance. The characters in this film were so believable, except for the character of Ruby. They might as well have had Ruby played by Daffy Duck; it would have had the same effect. This movie is steeped in realism, but Renee takes the audience out of that realism and puts them into another movie. The character was a nice contrast to all of the low-key characters, and was necessary for some comic relief, but a better actor should have been used. Phillip Seymour Hoffman's performance is a better example of doing a colorful and comedic performance without being out of place. Rene Zellweger was acting in a completely different movie than everyone else. You think that the director would have noticed and had her tone her performance down a bit. That being said, the rest of the supporting cast is outstanding (unfortunately, the leads are rather flat). Phillip Seymour Hoffman, as I mentioned before, and Natalie Portman are the ones who ""stole the show"" and Renee Zellweger should be happy she was not in any scenes with either of those actors because they are a completely different caliber of actors than she, and it would be very apparent that she doesn't know what screen acting is. Her style would be better suited for stage performances, because that kind of acting is necessary for that environment.Gee, I guess I don't much like Renee Zellwegger. I never realized that until now. All in all, I still think Cold Mountain was an excellent film with some amazing cinematography. The visuals alone are enough to see this film.",Cold Mountain
284,allthumbs,Episodic Civil War Story,8,2 February 2004,"mengella tells frazier's episodic war tale with finesse.i've read many, but not all, comments on this graceful but violent movie.a long time ago, i read a comment about the five essential things to a good/great movie. the five were grace, line, tone, speed and heart.this movie measures up as:GRACE: it is surely beautiful to see, and perfectly played as an anti-war film. the violence is contrasted with the desire for peace after seeing the realities of war.LINE: here's a problem. episodic films work only if each different segment lead to a convincing end. also, the movie tries to tell one episodic tale about inman, and a story in linear fashion about ada. while the cuts aren't too jarring, they change the pace of the movie.TONE: well, it's the old ""war is hell, and i'm disgusted"", refrain. however, mengella manages it well on both fronts. the opening scene at petersburg, the incidents of inmans return, and ada's tribulations and rebirth at her farm give us a sense of time and place, necessity and hope, fear and caution.SPEED: ok. at 2.5 hours we're moved along with intriquing scenes. but some episodes stand out. the natalie portman episode was filled with irony. the backwoman healer episode was interesting, but felt more like a 50's half hour teleplay. (think twilight zone, or 5 star theatre.)HEART: well, it's all here. desire, difficulties, resolution.in total, a good to great type of movie, handled well.so, go see it. it's worth the cash.",Cold Mountain

He goes off to fight, she stays and waits for him.My first problem was i did not think the director developed the love story enough. It was love at first sight but not convincing enough for me. I kept asking myself, why has she fallen for this guy she has only just met? Once the film gets going it was quite watchable. There is a bit of gore with he battle scenes and the war is a constant part of the plot with shootings all through.The acting is good although for my English taste I think Zelleweger does a a bit too much over acting.All in all worth watching.",Cold Mountain

I guess I can't particularly say what part of this movie I didn't like, but it just didn't get me enough into the story to really feel for the characters.In a way it reminded me of that dutch film, Antonia's Line (not exactly like it, but similar feeling...  I guess the remainder of the cast having dinner in a garden brought that movie back), however the later seemed like a much better movie to me.Also, the visual stress that the movie shows (sawing of the bull, killing of the goat and neck twisting of the rooster) seemed to substract instead of add to the movie like it should have.(If I keep going on people are gonna get tired of my message...)Point is, I can't say that the story was bad, it just managed to loose me and things got reaaaaally boring after that.Ignacio",Cold Mountain

288,kitkat9,There Are No Small Actors,7,20 March 2004,"This is a great drama that contains many interesting elements of romance, struggle, and the human condition, that nicely combine into a satisfying plot but it is truly the actors (and mainly the supporting ones at that) that make this a film worth seeing. There are many striking performances from individuals who ofter go above and beyond their pre-established skill levels.  Indeed, it is not the actors telling the story but rather the characters themselves. The Stanislavski method was definitely in use and just as the actors had immersed themselves in the roles, we, the audience we're able to be fully immersed in the story. Of particular note (besides, of course, the incomparable Renee Zellweger, who is fantastic but won her Oscar based not only on this performance but that of the last three years of work!) are Natalie Portman, Giovanni Ribisi, Kathy Baker and Philip Seymour Hoffman, who all make the most of their brief, yet poignant, appearances in the film.  Each of these actors make their jobs seem effortless and all have an incredible way of getting at the soul of the piece and the heart of the audience. All in all, this is a fine drama and worth at least one look.  Be prepared to get lost in the story and inwardly applaud those who made its telling possible.",Cold Mountain
289,Sarie26,Not the year's best but a darn goon one!,8,8 March 2004,"At the end of the Civil War, Confederate soldier W.P. Inman (Jude Law) makes the long, arduous journey back to Cold Mountain, North Carolina to reunite with his sweetheart, Ada Monroe (Nicole Kidman), whom he left four years ago with only the promise of a relationship-to-be.This epic romance was adapted from the popular bestseller by Charles Frazier, and I'd have to say they did a pretty good job converting the book to film. This movie was met with a lot of disapproving critical reactions but to be honest, I really enjoyed it. I like all of Anthony Minghella's films. And I'll tell you what, it's a lot easier to understand waiting four years for someone you have barely spoken to when that someone is played by Jude Law (or Nicole Kidman, depending on which way you want to look at it - either way, they're both impossibly beautiful).The movie does have some flaws. One - it's hard for our now more...promiscuous human race to understand waiting and waiting and waiting...and waiting and waiting to be with someone you just kissed four years ago. But times were different! At least that's what I told myself. However, this was smoothed over by a hell of a kiss between Law and Kidman before he takes off. I don't know what the critics were thinking when they said there was no chemistry between them, because I'm a-tellin' you these two were on FIRE. I almost felt guilty watching them.Two - and I will be met with some disapproval here, but I absolutely did not like Renee Zellweger as Ruby Thewes, the pistol-packin' mama who comes in to help Ada survive the war. Ruby is a cool character in the book, but I didn't approve of Zellweger's over-the-top, cartoonish, stereotypical Southerner. I will never in a million years understand her receiving an Oscar for this role - it had to be a pity vote. She's kind of funny, but ultimately obnoxious, especially if you read the book - she wasn't at all what I pictured.However, what you do have are divine leads. Jude Law was absolutely wonderful as Inman, exactly as I pictured it in the book. He definitely went through a great transformation along with his character - you'll see him sweat and strain through gunshots, near-deaths, starvation and heartsickness. It's a wonderful moment when he finally gets back to Cold Mountain and reunites with Ada, who I also thought was played beautifully by Nicole Kidman. Were I the one casting, I think I would have gone for someone a little younger for the role, but Nicole has the depth to carry this woman through four years of struggling and starvation. I'm not sure why people attacked Nicole's performance so much, I thought it was subtle and elegant. And as much as I didn't like the Renee casting, she and Nicole were good together. I felt the sisterly love.Also some fine cameos in the supporting cast - a brilliant performance by Natalie Portman is the near-highlight of the movie, rivaled by Kathy Baker as Ada's kindly neighbor Sally.And at the risk of sounding totally and completely shallow - oh what the hell, you'll all agree with me anyway - y'all should watch this movie if for NO other reason but the amazing, amazing scene between Law & Kidman at the end. Oh man... ...I wonder if Jude Law realizes that he will, in fact, be marrying me? He can be MY ain true love! Yeeeehaw!All in all, not the best movie of the year but a dern good one. 4/5",Cold Mountain
290,J_7,new meaning to the word facial,3,22 January 2005,"A movie incredibly over-awarded. Sure, Zellwegger is good but I think she's had more Oscar worthy performances. Ever since the divorce, I've come to really appreciate Nicole Kidman but this is just crap. I don't like Jude Law but tried not to think about it when I watched this. The problem is that even if these two did get together, it would most likely have been more of an occasional visit type of thing. Maybe this worked in the book, but it just didn't pan out for me. If you want to see one of the stupidest courting scenes, watch Kidman play piano on the back of a moving wagon while she's intermittently watching Jude Law in the field. It's so stupid, I wonder who her publicist is. I know that everyone in America really loved this movie and thought it was the godsend of great post Civil War romance/dramas but in my opinion, America seems to have forgotten Gone With the Wind. Want to see really painful love experiences and blood, and war, and drama, and everything else really uncomfortable? Watch Vivien Leigh be Scarlet O'Hara and you will wonder why you thought Cold Mountain was so good. And the sex scene? Yeah, right. I'm sure it's a really sexy experience for someone who's never seen a naked man before. Imagine, in real life, they both had butt facials and I just couldn't get over that one real aspect of movie making. Who needs to see that anyway? I don't. Rent a porn if you need to sex in a movie. It completely took away from the ""love"" and you realize that these people have been jonesning from afar for way too long. They could have picked someone else up by now. Just forget about this sappy, crappy, junky Hollywood movie that is a terrible excuse for believability -- unless, of course, you like that kind of thing.",Cold Mountain

It simply sucked! with a boring and pointless story, over-acting, over-dramatization with prolonged, superficial and over the top romantic exchanges. As for directing, well...it had to be bad to put together such a lousy product. There was absolutely no true romantic chemistry between Kidman and Law, nor was there any build up for their relationship. I did not feel connected to any of the characters, and there were way too many of them with very short life span, as if the director was trying to con us into liking the movie based on its size. The movie did not move me in any way. It didn't make me feel sad, funny, excited, or entertained. I simply didn't care. Rarely has a movie made me feel so indifferent about its plot or any of its characters. It is worse than day-time soap operas.

Jack White should have been in more films after. His role wasn't large but what he did felt natural. The only thing that gets on my nerves in this film re Hollywood is the typical actors ""go to"" gimmick. In this case it would be Renee Zellweger's attempt at a pouty mouth and overly circled lips as Julia Roberts has the obnoxious laugh they force these gimmicks into almost all films. Other than that, I've not got a bad thing to say about it. It was Charlie Hunnam's best American accent yet.

Unfortunately, he only knew her for one month or so before he went to war.  Well, I guess that is the irony business.  They are consumed by love for each other.

297,lostcheerio,Beautiful and Sad,9,1 July 2006,"Liking Jude Law has been elevated to the level of national pastime among my demographic. The last few movies I've seen him in, he was in his clever fop mode, and I started losing sight of why. In this movie, he was different. Spectacularly different. I never watched this movie when it came out, because I thought it was going to be sappy. It was not. The reason is Jude Law and his fierce, raw performance as the soldier dude who leaves the confederate army after coming back from the brink of death from a gunshot. He leaves to walk a thousand miles through a war zone, avoiding the home guard who want to put him back in the army. The reason he walks is Nicole Kidman, the awkward and beautiful belle he left back home in Cold Mountain, was being harassed by locals and starved by the war. She wrote him a letter telling him she needed him back.It's rare when two actors can make love at first sight work on screen. These do.Another reason I didn't watch it was that I have an irrational dislike for Renee Zellwegger and she got so much attention for her role, which I thought would be too precious. It was a little precious, but also was hilarious. In this very dark movie, which had me crying a bunch of times, it was a welcome bit of levity.I'm glad I watched it finally. Wouldn't want to do it again soon, because of the wrenching sadness. In the ethos of this movie, there are more than two sides in a war, and none of them are good. The victims are the soldiers, the civilians, and everyone affected by the changed rules of war. ""Hey, there's a war on,"" is an excuse for a lot of sick injustice, and that doesn't ever seem to change.",Cold Mountain

We also see how the lovers were separated by the war, how the war destroyed Inman's spirit and the only thing that kept him alive was his desire to get back to Ada. Ada in the meantime, had to grow up the hard way after her father died. Then enter Rene Zellweger's character, Ruby.

301,jordans51,"Despite attractive leading characters, it was a disappointment.",6,20 January 2004,"I go to the cinema infrequently these days.  I love the old movies, but I am usually disappointed by the chase-them, bed-them, blow-them-up approach taken by so many of our current movie makers.  Advertisements for ""Cold Mountain"" managed to conquer my trepidation.  It seemed that  finally we were going to be given a real old-fashioned romance along with a bit of history.  I regret to say that it was a disappointment.There was romance, of course.  I found the main story line of star-crossed lovers very appealing, and I thought that the lead actors carried it off very well.  They were attractive and generally convincing.  Also, the supporting cast was excellent, the cinematography was outstanding, and the director did a good job of depicting the horrors and sadness of war, both in battle and on the home front.  As a student of history, however, I must say that historical accuracy did not enter into it.  Perhaps this was also true of the novel.  Since I have not read it, I cannot say.The way this story is presented, the Home Guard was nore of a threat to the Southern civilian population than the Union Army.  This, of course, is utter nonsense.  The Home Guard was made up of men too old or too young to serve in the army, and its primary mission was home defense -- not hunting down deserters and shooting them on sight.  In reality, the aim of Confederate officials was to return deserters to their units in condition to fight -- not as cadavers.At the time our fictional hero was trying to make his way back home to the North Carolina mountains (in the winter of 1864-5), there were deserters all over the South, especially in areas of strong pro-union sentiment such the Southern highlands.  Also there were thousands of former Confederate soldiers who had been seriously wounded in the fighting and invalided out of service.  Under these conditions, does one think that a man like Teague, along with his murderous companions, could have terrorized and entire county for months on end?  But the lack of historical accuracy is not my main problem with the movie.  After all, when do you go to the cinema expecting an accurate portrayal of an historical event?  Like most people, I go principally for entertainment.  On that level, my real problem with this movie is some of the excessive non-battlefield violence and the graphic sexual encounter that is depicted at one point in the movie.  That sexual scene was gross, unnecessary, and over the top.  It made be embarrassed to be in the theater, and I was embarrassed for the actresses who had to bare their breasts and bottoms to make the scene.",Cold Mountain

She completely stole the show as the loud and seemingly emotionless drifter. Nicole, as always, was brilliant, but I couldnt help but feel that Renee totally overpowered her.
The film was extraordinary with a great script. I was reduced to tears on more than one occasion, the film moved me immensley. From each heart breaking letter that Ada (Nicole Kidman) sent to Inman (Jude Law) to each step Inman took to get home to his love. The ending wasn't 'typical Hollywood' and was one of the most powerful ending's I have seen in a film for a long time.

This movie was utterly boring, as yet another episode in the society governed by the moving image.  Boring boredom.  Bad adaptation, badly used script... every thing about this was simply bad. I think Nicole kidman has great artistic skills and the same goes for Jude Law, but what on earth made them take up this horible movie - maybe the fact that miramax had 85 mil to misuse.

304,boomaga1,The stars are the weak points,7,6 November 2006,"""Cold Mountain"" - a movie that you can watch.Script: tight, if you can mentally insert the ""Years later..."" card between a few scene cuts, and I know you can. A few Oscar-bait monologues are clunky in that adapted-from-the-novel way... but that's just me, I like to be shown rather than told by a character what they're going through.Production design: convincing, believable, with that old movie-magic feeling of being a window into the way people lived oh so long ago and far away... (though when Kidman walks in front of it, the jarring incongruity jumps out that, despite her partial grime-over, there simply were no women as pretty as Nicole Kidman 140 years ago. Squinty-eyed pout-machine Zellweger looks more like Appalachian mountain breeding stock.) Cinematography: Amazing. Everything has the natural light look - absolutely absorbing. One of the most beautiful winter snow scenes ever filmed.Story: Good Guys good, Bad Guys bad... with their character conflict/resolutions built right in. A series of long, protracted tragedies you don't have to see comin' round the mountain when they come. But still, the familiar crudeness and cruelty of events have that original-source feel - when life was more of the hardscrabble scrape than the dreamworld we live in. Casting: Ahhhhh... this is where the movie both succeeds and fails. It's mostly inspired. Jude Law and Brendan Gleeson are very good... no, they're excellent. The character actors are all first-rate - I mean, you could SMELL the backwoods witch goat-lady. Jack White does a fine understated job, though I found it impossible to stop seeing Jack White and thinking how cool it was that Jack White was in this movie, and wondering if Jack White was really playing his instrument. (It couldn't have been more amazing if his character's name was ""Jack White"" too - I mean, that even sounds like the name of a traveling mountain musician. Anyhow, the point is it kind of breaks the spell. )And Philip Seymore Hoffman is good in anything.But this movie belongs to Ray Winstone. His Confederate villain is more than just menacing. He's got the violence of battlefield madness in his quiet voice. (Can you believe he's British ? His Southern accent wasn't just convincing, it was FLAWLESS, something that even American-born Yankees can't manage.)I know villains never get For Your Consideration treatment - but this one should've instead offfffffffff..... (*drum roll*)ZELLWEGER-MANIA !She won award after award for this. People gushed about how great she was as the comic relief. Hm. I didn't find anything she said or did particularly comic. And I could spend a little while detailing why she shouldn't have all those awards. Cause Renée Zellweger stinks. Her accent is inconsistent and drawling - it's Appalachian mountain folk accent, Renée, not Savannah, not 'Bama, not Texas or Nawlinz... Study the dialect tapes, honey. Amazingly, she's up against British, Australian, and Irish lead actors, and yet her accent is the weakest. Maybe that's why she kept changing her mind about it as the movie progressed. (Do like Kidman does - pick one wrong accent, and stick with it.)Zellweger plays her character with three emotions - mad, madder, and wounded-&-mad. But it's not the bitter anger of a young woman whose life has already let her down and had to come up fighting - it's more like the pouting petulance of a teenager who spends most of the day brooding cause she's mad at her mom. She's so ADORABLE when she pouts ! Oh no, her pouting is out of control ! Ha ha, oh, Renée !How does Zellweger keep getting work ? Beats me. I wonder if her British affectation is any more convincing. Who would've been better in this role ? Oh, I could say something cruel like, ""Hold an open casting call and throw a rock."" But instead, let me ask who might have been a WORSE casting choice for Renée Zellweger's role. The answer springs immediately to mind: Winona Rider. An only slightly worse choice. Also, it seems Nicole Kidman is in the movie. ""Cold Mountain"" may have originally been a vehicle for her. I like Kidman, and she's done good work elsewhere; it's just that this was just not a standout role for her. Next to the wailing klaxon horn of Zellweger's acting, Kidman seems merely to perform adequately. And again, it doesn't help that she's just too Hollywood-pretty for the part. Truthfully, both female leads could've been cast better. Because the other issue is that not for a MOMENT did I believe that Jude Law's and Nicole Kidman's characters were attracted to each other. Sting, who used to be a rock and roll singer, wrote the theme song that uses the word ""ain"" in the title, which just gives me Reason #98 to want to kick him in the *ss. But I can't fault the movie's music at all. Good score, great sound.So there you go. ""Cold Mountain."" A movie that you can watch.",Cold Mountain

I never bought into the great love between the Kidman and Law characters--love at first site (especially intense/non-physical love) is hard to convey and altho they are fine actors, and I truly enjoyed the growth/transformation of the Kidman character throughout the movie, I didn't buy the premise.

313,Wonderkind,Minghella and his mountain,8,21 May 2005,"Anthony Minghella, perhaps not a genius, but a storyteller. This film is a visual feast, the cinematography is in parts, breathtaking. Each camera angle adds to the simple message, this is not a story about the American Civil War, this is a story about love. Any person who is after realism will be sorely disappointed. Despite the constant historical references, Jude Law escaping and wandering back to Ada is something that in essence, is part of the theme of love, the theme of the beauty in love. Of course most instances are highly improbable and sometimes laughable e.g. that he can stray across a woman herding goats and be lifted by an old woman to be nurtured back to life, but what we must understand is that in film, nothing is realistic. Nothing is real. Accept that and I believe this film is incredible. So it may be designed to pull on the heartstrings, but what is cinema for if not for evoking emotion? Cold Mountain is not a masterpiece but is still a piece of art. Grudgingly, I'll accept some lines are cheesy, out of place, ridiculous, but isn't that what you want from a love story? Perhaps I am just a romantic but I found this gripping, not didn't find it long and boring, but then I enjoyed The English Patient. I'd say, definitely, this is worth watching.",Cold Mountain
314,elinmagdalena,Fails structure wise.,4,5 September 2010,"The decision to tell this story in flashbacks for much of its beginning does not work to it's advantage as a film. Since I have not read the book, I am not sure how the author structured it to begin with. But flashbacks are always tricky to work with, it has to be done in the right way. Patricularly in films you have to set up the story and characters before you begin throwing flashbacks at the audience.That's my major complaint about ""Cold Mountian"". We get thrown into a love story without first knowing the people it involves, so why should we care? There are some good scenes scattered here and there, and it's a beautiful film to watch; wonderful landscapes, detailed, pretty clothes and attractive people. And the war is portrayed in a respectful manner I guess. Yet, I cannot feel anything for the main characters. It's not that I'm not moved by some scenes, but it's never about their love, it's more about the circumstances of war, and the more interesting character of Ruby.It moves way to quickly, especially in the beginning, for the mood and the care to set in. It feels like a whole 30 minutes or more is missing from the setup. I'm sure the story works better in the book, but it does not hold together as a film. It gets boring as soon as it stops portraying war and goes for the main love story. Might have been better as a mini series.In short: A love story seldom works if you don't care about the lovers. And ""Cold Mountian"" does not give their lovers a chance.",Cold Mountain

Also, the somewhat graphic depiction of rape and brutality amongst people surprised me.The performances are excellent, with Jude Law playing the handsome farm boy who falls in love with Ada(Kidman) and his obstacles and challenges that he encounters on his way home to her. But I must say, I was highly impressed with Renee Zellweger's contribution to the dramatic scale of the film. She portrays the 'workaholic' role very well and captures the very emotion and feeling that she possesses depending on the situation.I thought that this was a nice story and however brutal, or sexual it may be, can be enjoyed by quite a range of audiences",Cold Mountain
317,Ulysses186,"Love, Loss, and Drama during the Civil War",6,24 September 2006,"The film Cold Mountain portrays aspects of the Civil War in many different ways. Cold Mountain does not focus on an actual battle, or series of battles, but rather around the lives of a few people and how the war at large impacts all aspects on their lives. The film depicts an odd duality, a double edged sword, and shades of gray that have become the modern understanding of the Civil War. The war is shown as not an end, or final destination, but rather as a journey, fraught with war and peace, love and hate, and action both magnanimous and malevolent, and all the shades in between.The film opens with the siege of Petersburg. An explosion tears the cities defenses asunder, and soon after an unfortunate union corps charges into the crater left by the explosion. Here an understanding of the savagery and murderous nature of the war was illustrated as hundreds of Confederate soldiers take position around the edge of the crater and pick off the helpless Union forces trapped inside. Wild calls of bloodlust fill the air as countless blue coats die. Yet amongst the bloody horrors of war the protagonist Inman, dives selflessly into the crater in attempts to rescue a mortally wounded comrade. Though surrounded by an immense slaughter one man brazenly risks his own life to save that of another. This action shows us the duality of the understanding of the war, wanton carnage, and selfless valor to protect life all in the same scene.Life away from the front is seen through the eyes of another protagonist, Ada, a preacher's daughter cast adrift in a small unfamiliar town. Her love interest, Inman, goes off to war leaving her alone to cope with the hardships the war brings to those who remain behind. The war brings chaos to a previously tranquil environment. At the onset the men cheer for their long awaited war, and joyfully march off to the sorrow that awaits them on the battlefield. The film illustrates the hardships that await those who remain as the news of the deaths of the once exited boys return to Cold Mountain. Ada nears madness with uncertainty and anticipation of Inman's fate. The townsfolk suffer under the unscrupulous care of the local magistrate and his posse. Life at home slowly unravels into struggle and despair. The portrayal of the hardships of the civilian southerners establishes a modern understanding that the war left no aspect of social life unscathed.The stark suffering of the battle's aftermath is portrayed as Inman is wounded and taken to an over-crowded makeshift hospital. Men lay all around, bleeding and dying as moans of their suffering fill the space. These scenes add additional understanding of the massive scale of pain and human loss. Yet in this hopeless location, one man's will to live and to return to his love overcome the grisly reality and as soon as he is physically able he decides to desert and fueled by a letter he takes on the long and arduous journey home.The journey of Inman echoes the central focus of the film. This journey exposes the viewer to various social and individual impacts left by the war. The chaos created by the war act as a perfect backdrop to display both the very best and very worst aspects of human nature. Inman comes across reverend Veasey, who is about to drop an unconscious African American woman into a river because he had impregnated her. Later he and Veasey pay a young girl an exorbitant price to be ferried across a river to escape perusing soldiers tracking deserters, half way across she offers her body up for a price. A moment later she is killed by rifle fire from the departure point. After their escape Inman and the fugitive Veasey come across a man who offers room and board for their assistance, they agree and are baited into a trap set for deserters. Later Inman is welcomed into the home of a young, recently widowed mother, her infant son is ill, her husband had been killed in action and she is left to reconcile survival with the pain of carrying on alone in the world. All of these vignettes signify the disorder, opportunism, and survival mechanisms of individuals attempting to cope with the societal shock-waves of the Civil War.One of the few positive side effects of the war portrayed in the film is how circumstances caused by the war bring individuals together. As Ada struggles with depression and madness another young woman, Ruby, appears on her dilapidated farm to assist her. Ada might not have survived otherwise. The two women help inspire each other to do what is necessary to survive. These circumstances allow Ruby to reconcile with her estranged father, and meet her future husband.As Inman's long journey reaches it end and he returns to Ada it seems that all the suffering each had to overcome was worth the cost, love triumphs over trials. However, their time together is not long as Inman is fatally wounded in a gunfight with a local unscrupulous law officer. The long journey home and all the ordeals that were overcome seem to be for naught. Despite this tragedy, Ada is able to move on her with her life and with the help of her new friends, all brought together by the war, and create a good and happy life.",Cold Mountain

321,supernova_painkiller,"i really loved it, despite the main couple in the beginning...",9,15 April 2011,"Don't misunderstand me, I liked the acting, but I thought that relationship between Inman and Ada was so sudden, unexplored and poorly developed that I could understand anyone who'd give up in the first 20 min of film (although I disapprove this). But anyone that did not it, had surely (like myself) a wonderful surprise. While separated, Inman and Ada are such powerful characters. Unfortunately they just work as a couple at the very ending of the movie, when there's not much left.I like Jude Law very much, but I think (like many people do) that he finds hard sometimes to flee the stereotype that he's got over the years (it happens when you watch Alfie and thinks - Oh no, he is playing ""Jude Law""* again), but in this movie he stood still and cried out loud ""Yes I can!"" ""I can be someone else, I have talent"". Yes, he does, and moreover playing a difficult character which gives you no clue of his heart and behavior, and you see that the actor have to build it up from nothing, he did. And could give us his own mark (believe he has one, he just needs to show it more times). Well-deserved nomination. Two lines he said that I won't forget: ""I marry you, I marry you, I marry you"" and (when Ada asks him to turn his back so she could undress and he so decided and sweetly says...) ""No, I will not"". Oh I almost forgot the scene when he gets shot, coughing blood (to die), was so well-done!Kidman (who I don't like) did a good job, her character was more interesting when alone or in company of a great Zewegger, which she spent most part of the movie. But I still think that she could do some more. I see her in the movie and think ""only if she had done more about acting she could have been convincing"", her role was a real good and easy one, she threw away a great opportunity.René was superb. Althoug in the beginning I thought ""she is far-fetched"", but along the movie be she knew how to, covertly, do it right. I don't much to say, for it is impeccable.What as good surprise I had with Portman, Jack White, Philip and the rest of the cast.This movie, amongst The Talented Ripley, made me feel very interested about Minghella's work, the next to be seen (by me) is the English patient. The photography was amazing, how could it not receive a nomination? (that's why I think that the Academy is a crap) Well directed, well acted, good screenplay, although it was confused at first...So, I truly recommend this one, but be patient and watch it until the end, and not just give up at the first half hour. Give it a chance, it will give you a sweet surprise.* When I say ""playing Jude Law again"" I do not mean the person ('cause, obviously, I don't know him), I mean the actor.",Cold Mountain

324,SurlyRonin,Good but...,7,29 December 2003,"I must admit, after watching the trailers, I wanted to despise this movie. It seemed a heap of melodrama with some utterly stupid dialogue (what was Ruby saying about the weather again?  Come on...) intended only to win Oscars for Miramax.  And while it had all the trademarks of Minghella, the overt symbolism and sheer epic-ness seemed to work for it.  Certainly the performances by Jude Law and Renee Zellweger will not go unnoticed come the Oscars - Jude is quite touching as a man of few words with his emotions all stirring beneath his face, and Renee is a barrel of energy and intensity who can put on the brakes when she has to.  Both create very unique performances, which cannot, unfortunately, be said of Nicole Kidman.  Brilliant in the Hours, here she returns to her trademark ticks and stock emotions, which are normally quite nice, but certainly don't match up with the other more subtle and intriguing people that surround her.  As well, her accent is pretty awful, even for Hollywood-impersonates-the-South standards, and she is FAR too old for the role this time.  Really surprising is Natalie Portman in her small role, getting back to acting after her horrendous turns in Star Wars. In five minutes of screen time she shows more layering and creates more understanding for a character than she has in the last five years of her career.  Perhaps she should have been given a chance at Ada, although Miramax must have desired a huge star in the lead, regardless of how ill-suited she is for it.  Overall, probably Minghella's best movie to date, with possible Oscars for Cinematography, Actor, and Supporting Actress, but if this gets Director and Picture over ROTK, it'll be a crime. 7.5/10",Cold Mountain
325,shesanopenbook,"When a movie tries to be everything to everyone, it usually fails to live up to anyone's expectations. Cold Mountain is one of few exceptions to that rule.",7,14 July 2004,"When a movie tries to be everything to everyone, it usually fails to live up to anyone's expectations. Cold Mountain is one of few exceptions to that rule. The critically acclaimed, award-winning film is now available on 2-disc DVD and VHS.While the recent theatrical success of Fahrenheit 9/11 highlights the country's division regarding the war in Iraq, this film tells a similar tale. Set in a time where America was torn apart by clashing ideology and values, Cold Mountain is an epic saga of life during Civil War America. In it, we bear witness to the lives of a blossoming couple who are torn apart by duty and loyalty to one's country. Inman (Jude Law, Road To Perdition) is a young Confederate solider who, after being wounded in battle, deserts the war and takes a 300 mile walk toward home and his sweetheart, Ada Monroe (Oscar winner Nicole Kidman, The Hours). Inman's journey takes him away from the war and towards the peace he sees can only reside at home with his love. But, standing in his way are bounty hunters, slaves, sirens and Union soldiers at every turn. Meanwhile, well-to-do Ada takes a journey of her own. While his absence cements her feelings for him, Ada fears her love for Inman may be in vain as her countless letters go unanswered. When her father dies suddenly, she must learn to take care of herself and to survive long winters, merciless lawmen and overwhelming solitude. Along the way, she forms a life-long alliance with Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellweger, Chicago), a scrappy drifter who only knows hardship and back-breaking work.Cold Mountain is a breathtaking drama and love story starring award-winning actors, based on an award-winning book and directed by an award-winning director. Written by Charles Frazier in 1997, Cold Mountain, the novel, won the National Book Award that same year. Director, Anthony Minghella (The English Patient, The Talented Mr. Ripley) came across the book and decided to adapt it into the film now known for seven Oscar nominations including Best Supporting Actress, Best Actor, Best Cinematography and Best Score. In addition to about a thousand Romanian soldiers, the film also includes cameos by Natalie Portman (Star Wars Episode II: Attack of the Clones), Jena Malone (Saved!), Jack White (singer of the rock band The White Stripes), Phillip Seymour Hoffman (25th Hour), Giovanni Ribisi (Lost in Translation), Donald Sutherland (The Italian Job) and more. Cold Mountain has been released on DVD and VHS. Special features on the 2-disc collector's edition include feature commentary with the director and editor; 'Climbing Cold Mountain', a documentary; 'Words and Music of Cold Mountain', a 90-plus minute special about the music behind the movie; 'A Journey to Cold Mountain', a featurette on the making of the film; 3 storyboard comparisons and 11 deleted scenes. Not only does this film deglamorize war and highlight its violence and brutality, Cold Mountain also takes us beyond the battlefield and into the lives of the civilians, many of them women, left behind to fend for themselves while the majority of the men fight for their cause. Rarely do you come across a film about the Civil War that is accessible to all people. Surprisingly, Cold Mountain has the ability to draw in men with its action and women with its romance. Though, the film does drag a bit at times, Zellweger makes up for it in her Oscar winning performance as the strong-willed yet humorous Ruby. In fact, all of the acting is brilliant. The above-mentioned cameos are all well executed and Kidman and Law are extremely believable as the star-crossed lovers, Ada and Inman. Shot largely in the unspoiled country of Romania, the landscape is stunningly beautiful. To top it all off, the well-crafted film is also set to a phenomenal score by Oscar-winning composer Gabriel Yared and original music performed by Sting, Elvis Costello, Jack White and many others.Cold Mountain gives the audience a little bit of everything: action, romance, drama, even some comedy. It is a sweeping epic with big battle sequences, passionate love scenes and a haunting score. And, yes, it is worth 2 ½ hours of your time.",Cold Mountain

A couple years ago, here came ""Chocolat"" bumbling along in all it's sensual tastes that were bittersweet to most.  Last year, the literary tale ""The Hours"" was transformed into a psuedo-epic of triple proportions, and it seemed the only thing the movie was accomplishing was obtaining acting prizes.  So, here we are, another year, another Oscar season, and another Oscar-made production.  Ladies and Gentlemen, I give you ""Cold Mountain.""Hmm, where shall I start?  Let's start with the movie itself.  The grand scale in which director Anthony Minghella paints his portrait of the ""South"" is relatively huge.  The landscapes are opulent, lush beyond your wildest dreams.  In fact, it rivals LOTR in the category of ""Beautiful Scenery."" The story isn't all that bad.  The writing isn't spectacular, but it probably will be nominated for reasons already mentioned.  The dreaminess of the film is all around beautiful, spectacular in all its shapes and colors, and the spectacle of such a view is unmatched in many parts of the world. (However, this movie was made in Romania, which continues the trend of artsy moviemakers moving their production sets around the world, and that doesn't fare well to the US)  The fault of the film does not lie with Minghella. In fact, I believe that he and Ms. Zellweger deserve nominations, if not wins. So, what exactly makes this movie subpar, or par in some people's eyes? Well, it's mainly the acting of Jude Law and Nicole Kidman.How many times is good ol' Jude gonna say with his faux-southern gruff tone the word ""Ada"" with a heavy accent on the ""D""?  Seriously, I thought he was, to put it bluntly, a meathead.  I'm not saying Jude is a horrible actor by no means.  In fact, at the beginning of the movie, it seemed to me that he was going to have a breakout performance, one of those ""quiet and subtle"" performances that Benicio Del Toro has perfected.  However, by the end of the movie, I saw how much Jude failed in his quest to be a leading man. His character didn't change.  Period.  He was the same rumbling, bumbling, stumbling baffoon who left Cold Mountain at the beginning of the movie. Such a shame.  Nicole Kidman, on the other hand, does less with the little she is given.  She's a remarkable actress, maybe the best of our time (although highly debatable), but she just doesn't do anything special here to merit a nomination, although many ""experts"" have her picked to be nominated.  She looks quite radiant in her belle costume, but not much of that radiation gets to the audience.  She is quickly turned upside down by the appearance of Renee Zellweger, who STEALS THE MOVIE!  I haven't seen such a remarkable performance by a supporting actress in quite some time. I even forgot it was her.  It may be Oscar grandstanding in a movie full of attempts at Oscar grandstanding, but this one is genuine in my mind.  She struts around, openly showing her accent and womanly power as if she had possessed it all her life.  Such an extravagent performance in an otherwise dull adaption.Final Grade:  C+",Cold Mountain

The film combines some epic footage with superb acting from Jude Law, Nicole Kidman",9,2 March 2004,"Cold Mountain	A fantastic, refreshingly original and understandably highly acclaimed film from the Writer and Director Anthony Minghella. The film combines some epic footage with superb acting from Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and in particular, Renee Zellweger. 	In his moving and dramatic film, Minghella adapts the book to the big screen with the sort of class and impeccable attention to detail that sets apart quality Writers and Directors from the rest. This is without a doubt the best film adapted from previous material and would be top in this Oscar category, sweeping aside films such as The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King, if it was not for the disgraceful shambles surrounding the fact that it was not nominated in the first place. Perhaps this polemic shows that the good people at the Academy didn't want Cold Mountain to go away with too many awards, having already been nominated for six, including Best Achievement in cinematography. 	As well as the amazing writing and direction of the film, Minghella has managed to use cameo appearances that were as surprising as the quality of the motion picture itself. The cast included actors such as Philip Seymour Hoffman, Giovanni Ribisi, Natalie Portman, Ray Winstone and Charlie Hunnam and many more. This large and tremendously talented cast of well chosen actors helped to give the film just what it needed, a strong sense of community and friendship. This in turn was a brilliantly thought out move to back up the strong bond shared by Inman (Jude Law) and Ada (Nicole Kidman), which is the crux of the film. 	The action sequences, although incredibly well filmed, were few and far between. Many war films have two plots, the main part of which being the battles, interspersed with short moments from the sub-plot (usually a love story). However, in this plot, such a structure is turned on its head with the main focus being Inman and Ada's struggle to find each other again in the face of considerable danger or hardship. All credit to the writer of the book, Charles Frazier, for creating such an inspiring, touching and originally masterpiece, and to the actors, producers, writers and director for doing it such immeasurable credit.   	Inman, the wood labourer turned Confederate soldier, struggles to deal with the pressures of the war, and after having been shot, an injury as well. He receives just three of Ada's numerous letters to him and when he hears, in the last letter, that she wishes him to return he sees his opportunity. Temporarily crippled by his injury, Inman must wait to recover before trying to come back to her.' One evening he escapes from the Military Hospital in which he is being treated and heads for his home town of Cold Mountain. Soldier turned deserter,' he is hunted down by the decadent Home Guard.' On his travels he meets an immoral Priest, banished from his home town, and together they are drawn into a web of deceit that leads them to being captured by the Guard, previously their Allies. Inman continues he fight, not only to get back to Ada, but also to survive with serious food and sleep deprivation. This fight is brilliantly acted in its entirety by Jude Law in this winning performance and supported by the cast of just as fine actors.	Meanwhile, Ada, sick with love for the man who she is desperate to see and hardly even knows at the same time as facing starvation. She writes that the war is being lost twice over by the people who have been left behind.' In one of her finest performances to date, Nicole Kidman shows that she really knows what acting is all about, emotion. Hungry and poor, Nicole Kidman receives just the help she needs, only from an unexpected source. Ruby (Renee Zellweger), appears on the scene in an excellent performance, capped by her very authentic and well developed Southern accent, to help out. As good as a man in practical skill, Ruby has learnt to look after herself from a young age. She too has her own problems to deal with. In particular, the appearance of her deserter father/ musician and his friends, triggers memories of her hard childhood, caused in part by the neglect of her father. The struggle that she faces is beautifully acted and the grit and the determination that make her what she is are the building blocks for the portray of her character in the film. Renee Zellweger does this with a style and uniqueness that makes the part her own. 	From set design, to plot, to fantastic casting, this film has all the right ingredients for an all round spectacular film. With one of the best film endings I have ever seen I can justify summing up with the words: Ingenious, resourceful, imaginative and Breath taking!",Cold Mountain
335,5dawgz,A rare film where the movie is better if you've read the book ...,9,31 July 2004,"Rarely is a movie improved by having read the book. Usually, whatever they do with the movie will be a disappointment if you loved the book. I love the book ""Cold Mountain"" and have read it at least 4 times. I think that it speaks to the horror of war, the wickedness of which the human species is capable, and the futility of the bloodshed better than any other book I've read. I think the movie captures those feelings very well indeed. I hope I am quoting this correctly (but I'm close, anyway) -- when Inman says that he is like any other fool ""going off to war with a lie and a flag"" ... well, yeah. A lie and a flag. That IS what war is, for the most part. The battle scenes at the beginning of the film, according to those who have been witness to real battles in war, are as good or better than any battle scenes ever filmed.The story is, of necessity, simplified for the purposes of the film and that's where it helped to have read the book. My husband and I were able to mentally fill in ""missing pieces."" I found that among my friends who saw the movie, those who did not first read the book thought it was okay, but didn't love it, whereas those of us who had first read the book, really LOVED the movie.I also felt the casting was exceptional and that Renee Zellweger well deserved her Oscar. When I realized that she had been cast as Ruby, I was highly dubious ... but she made it work. Jude Law, who is not usually cast as a leading man, gives a super performance, for which he has received surprisingly little recognition. Finally, if you love classic ""old timey"" country music, the score for this film is beautiful. As is the cinematography.This is not an upbeat movie, but it wasn't an upbeat book, either. The adaptation is deeply faithful to the author's intent. It's definitely worth watching ... maybe more than once. But also, perhaps it would be worthwhile to read the book first. Great book. Fine adaptation.",Cold Mountain
336,soffineer,In hopes of a better world,9,15 September 2004,"Aside from the fact that most people apparently are not cerebral enough, nor paying attention to details, the comments I have seen lack imagination in the extreme. When I see a movie I suspend disbelief and become absorbed with the plot and characters. I am, however, more disappointed to discover that there are a large number of people whose attention span does not go beyond 90 minutes.As to the film, I have seen it about 12 times which gave me the opportunity to watch the details and still I am compelled by this film. I have also read the book, which indeed does not match the film. However, the details that are added to the characters are worth the time to read it.I have to agree that Nichole's acting is shallow and that the development of her character seems lacking. As you watch Inman from the beginning to the end you see a remarkable change in his carriage, looks and demeanor that is stunning to watch. He ages in accordance with what he experiences. As you watch Ada, she does little more than change her clothing and it is obvious that makeup is performing all the acting when she should be blushing.Having seen both of these actors in other movies, I am very impressed with Jude Law and his desire to hone his craft. Nichole seems to be riding her sexuality to the end and I fear she will never go beyond that to make a real actress.I give this film a resounding 10/10 rating.",Cold Mountain
337,jack_attack69,Solid leads enhanced by an outstanding supporting cast.,8,4 December 2004,"As Nicole Kidman walks across the screen towards Jude Law, the question remains; where is the chemistry? As solid and thoughtful both actors portray Ada and Inman individually, together their love just doesn't seem believable. Law's limited expression doesn't benefit his character's myriad of emotions, and Kidman, though slightly more realistic, conveys, at best, a weak and fragile woman lost in depression. Despite these few faults, both the leads create the tone and mood of the film to be one of despair and depression, amidst all of the feelings of love.What makes Cold Mountain special is the supporting cast. Natalie Portman enrichens the screen as the wife of a soldier. While delivering her script with raw austerity, she also enhances Law's presence with her compassionate and understanding person, despite the turmoil surrounding her. Giovanni Ribisi also shines in his role, offering a believable and realistic role in the time of war.But it is here that Renee Zellweger shines. The minute Ruby appears to Ada, the movie changes it's monotony and depression to one with depth and even excitement. The way Zellweger shapes Ruby's personality towards her surroundings is a stark portrayal of strong women during war. Her Oscar is only a testament to one of the most captivating and intelligent performances of the 21st Century, rivalled only by Charlize Theron's portrayal of Aileen Wuornos. Ultimately, Cold Mountain depicts the solid leads enhanced by one of the greatest supporting cast ever to be assembled in a movie.",Cold Mountain
338,katsprogis,Don't compare it..,7,7 January 2005,"I do not understand how anyone can try to compare this to Gone with the Wind just because it took place during the same era. This was a story about another group of people during the civil war. Scarlett and Rhett were not the only southerners with a story during the civil war folks.Nicole and Renee were fantastic in their roles as 2 strong women trying to make it on Cold mountain. Although I did not find it as ""deep"" as I hoped and the film lacked something (I cannot put my finger on exactly what), I felt it was worth watching just to see Nicole and Renee's relationship grow and the bond that formed between them. Definitely worth watching!",Cold Mountain
339,dumbblonde416,Great Movie,10,1 August 2005,"This movie was good because of how it portrayed the Civil War, it wasn't boring at all. But I love it because of the way the actors portrayed their characters. Renee Zellweger was by far the star of the movie, stealing the show. Even though she is a supporting role, she plays Ruby so well, and she makes Ruby seem so real. Renee takes Ruby to so many different places in the movie. She makes Ruby a fighter at times, such as when she is kicking her father or swearing at him;and she is not afraid to make Ruby seem bossy, like when she is telling Ada all the farm chores that need to be done. She is not afraid to make Ruby seem ignorant, like when she does not understand why Ada cannot do all of the things she can. Not afraid to make her seem frightened, like when they rescue Sally; and Renee was not afraid to show Ruby's soft side, to break down all of the toughness surrounding her, such as when she starts to cry during the sequence when she tells Ada that she has ""big plans for that farm"" after Inman comes because she is afraid she is going to be made to leave; or when she starts to become emotional during her ""cloud over the land"" monologue. Renee had only played a suicidal woman, a thriller role, and several comedy roles before, and I think that this role is her most versatile and complex role yet. This is proved, since Renee won an Oscar for best supporting actress for ""Cold Mountain"" in the role of Ruby Thewes. She also pulled off a Southern accent perfectly. Nicole Kidman and Jude Law also did very well in their roles, and made their characters seem real. I don't think Nicole and Jude had that great of chemistry between them (maybe because of the age difference, Nicole=38, Jude=33)but they managed to make that seem not too apparent. This is a great film for someone looking to learn more about times of the Civil War, or for someone that just wants a good romance/action/drama/adventure flick. 10/10! :)",Cold Mountain

Horribly staged battle scenes, laughable dialogue, generic southern accents, and a story-line that would make the writers of daytime TV hide for shame.

343,fluke182,Most overrated film of 2003,6,27 December 2003,"This movie was just flat out disappointing. I love every actor in it (Save Jack White, who's White Stripes are the biggest travesty in music today), and you have to love the sweeping romance epic angle, but this movie was just...meh. It reminded me of a really really beautifully shot adaptation of a trashy romance novel. In the first hour the dialouge is flat out terrible. Revolting even. Jude Law was excellent as always but my god, Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger hurt me. The supporting cast saved the movie, Portman was wonderful, Gleason and Hoffman as always were excellent. But for the most part I was just sitting there wondering how this movie was nominated for 8 Golden Globes, or any for that matter. Maybe it's because I saw 21 Grams earlier in the day for the first time. This movie did not even make my top 10 for the year, no where close. It will be a joke if this wins Best Picture, just like Chicago was last year. I know it will be nominated for sure, but it really should not be. I liked this story better, when Homer wrote it... 6 of 10",Cold Mountain
344,FD-a,Unlikely Plot Elements and Cynical Trite Ending,3,1 February 2007,"This is my first comment on an IMDb page. Interesting idea. I suppose it is possible to be a ""spoiler"" for a three yr old film, so be warned. In fact I won't rent or see a film without knowing beforehand if the plot and acting are plausible. There is nothing particularly surprising or startling about film plot twits because most of them are taken from previous works or are a contrivance that contradicts logic. My purpose in reading literature and viewing movies is to see if authors and directors can extract accurate lessons from reality or history and apply them in a rational yet artistic ways as a means of teaching life lessons, reflecting in some believable way the ironies of fate.Mr. Minghella and his Editor cut this film up quite badly and left a lot of speculation hanging in mid air. Yes I'm going to have to read the novel to find what the author intended.The scene of the attack by Teague and Home Guard on the Swangers left me baffled. What all these location people, dialecticians, stunt men, historians and advisers don't know about North Carolinians could fill another book. Perhaps it is unwise to contradict a determined director when he has a specific story in mind.Five known enemies on horseback do not openly approach a mountain home occupied by three men (southern boys are men at 12yrs in that time), all armed and probably very well armed with ""souvenir"" battlefield pickups of the period. They boys would have brought home their muskets at the very least. Teague's marauders would have had to attack by stealth at night to gain sway over the Swanger household and even they they would have lost one or two men. An open approach in daylight would have ended their careers as ""guardsmen"", with perhaps one or two wounded and soon dispatched. That entire scene is nonsensical in the way it played out and spoiled the movie for me from that point on. Imagine four guns hidden and barricaded against five in the open. Wow! What a short film that was.The final denouement at Cold Mountain with the death of Inman was equally disappointing. This is a silly ending that says Inman learned nothing with all his battle experience and in fact forgot the lessons learned in dealing with Teague a few moments before. In fact this is exactly the kind of false moral that ideologues frequently inject into fiction, making it non-believable. When you chase down a man on horseback you need not catch up right away, especially tracking in snow. Let him tire out a while. Firstly you pick up Teague's repeating Spencer rifle, not a revolver with only one or two shots left. Then get into a position to shoot the horse out from under the fleeing murderer. Then wound him from long range repeatedly. Then leave him to freeze. Nature is your ally in this case. Mingella's notion that you negotiate with a ruthless torturer and try to convince him to go home peacefully after committing mass murder is plainly idiotic. This story should have had a happy ending with good triumphant over evil.In fact it is standard repetitive nauseating practice for screen writers to engage in amateur psychological (crackpot Freudian) speculation that war ruins men and violence even in the name of freedom and decency is inherently evil. Experience and history teaches us differently yet the beat goes on.I think a masterful film with much more authentic sensibilities could have been made from this material. Imagine having to construct a town in Romania. What was that about? There are no unspoiled wilderness scenes in the south? I lived for several years in Kentucky and Tennessee. Georgia and Alabama as well. I have hunted and hiked over the Smokies and traveled across both states extensively. There are hundreds of thousands of unspoiled acres of land and many very authentic ancient villages, cabins and farms scattered all over the South. Civil War reenactors abound all over the South. Men who would gladly volunteer to help make an authentic film.Many of these kinds of logistical location decisions, such as travel to Romania to ""rent the army"", are made as much for travel and vacation opportunities and social opportunities as much as budget considerations.Well, that's all I have to say about this until I read the original novel and find out what the author really had in mind.Will",Cold Mountain

348,pintofsmooth,Epic film-making of the highest caliber,9,19 October 2004,"As the dust clears and the rumor mills are finally silenced, it is time to acknowledge Anthony Minghella's Cold Mountain in a separate light from the tiresome and repeated scandals that surrounded its production. The film finally surfaces on both sides of the Atlantic conveniently in time for Oscar consideration, and the nods of recognition from the Academy must surely follow will be richly deserved. This is a wonderful movie, executed to perfection in both performance and direction and a fine example of epic film-making of the highest caliber.The narrative tells the story of a man known simply as Inman, played by Jude Law, who deserts his position at the front of the American Civil War in order to return to Nicole Kidman's Ada, his true love who stayed behind. The story splits its concern between the two characters as Inman continues his odyssey across war torn America and Ada undergoes a transformation of her own. Both Law and Kidman are excellent in their roles but the real revelation here is Renee Zellweger, whose performance breathes new life into the movie whenever it shows signs of flagging.It is a good job that the central figures do perform to the highest of their ability because the film is so packed with talent, any weak showing would be quickly overshadowed. It is hard to recall in recent times a movie that employs so many actors at the top of their game, even when playing cameo roles. Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Giovanni Ribisi and especially Natalie Portman all threaten to steal the scenes they share with a bewildered but single minded Inman.Complaints are few and minor, with the only major misjudgment occurring in an ill conceived and distastefully executed whore house scene. Some viewers may also find it hard to empathise with a romantic pairing that is given so little screen time to develop, and it is true that Inman and Ada develop very strong feelings in a short space of time. It is as Inman's hand that the explanation for this is found though as he clutches a photograph of Ada throughout. When war changes the world perspective around him, one image and one glimpse is all the motivation he needs.Cold Mountain is a riveting film that remains brutally true to its source material, and though this does make for a rather relentlessly bleak experience, it is refreshing to witness a director fully in control of his craft. Minghella has produced one of the best films of the year, an achievement that deserves to be assessed apart from its accompanying gossip.",Cold Mountain

The main love story is very well acted and there does not seem to be too many follies into the ""who cares"". From the trailers and TV spots I was expecting to be bored silly by this movie, only sitting through it to keep my wife company.I was very surprised, lots of war stuff for the boys, and an engaging love story without rambling into the corny or cliché.

I don't really mind Nicole Kidman but she does not deserve any nominations for this performance, nor does any one else in the cast.

351,Alex_Glass,A Review of Cold Mountain,9,3 January 2004,"*Slight spoilers but if any one has read a review of this film, they will probably know them all ready*Synopsis: Cold Mountain tells the story of Inman (Jude Law), a wounded Confederate soldier fighting in the American Civil War, and his journey home to meet his love, Ada (Nicole Kidman). Meanwhile, Ada is struggling to maintain her father's farm since he passed away. That is , until farm hand Ruby Thewes (Renee Zellwger) comes along.Many people have dismissed Cold Mountain as being boring and too romantic. Just because it is not an 'indie' film, it has rescieved mixed reviews. In fact, it is an excellent example of an epic and it is easy to see why the all star cast chose to star in this movie. It features drama, comedy, action and romance and is a movie and is a movie most people can enjoy.Inman's journey is similar to Homer's Oddysey and the colourful cast of characters he meets along the way are almost as interesting as the three leads. Natalie Portman in particular shines as a young widow. The two plot threads, Inman's journey home and Ada maintaining the farm, could stand alone quite easily. As much I liked Inman's action-packed voyage back to Cold Mountain, I thought the scenes with Renee and Nicole were more enjoyable.Ada loosing her reverend father, played by Donald Sutherland, is the first major emotional scene and it is done well without being cheesy. The introduction of Zellweger perks up the film. Her character is definatley the most interesting character and she is sure to win the Oscar this year. When first introduced, it is hard to understand her dialogue and it appears Zellweger is going for easy laughs by portraying stereotypes. Within about three minutes these thoughts are abolished and she helps to make the film more enjoyable. People who have seen it will know what I mean, especially on the 'bag of diamonds' scene. Ruby helps to make the emotional scenes less schmaltzy. Nicole portrays a subtle performance in Ada and proves once again why she is the greatest current actress in Hollywood. Ada's and Ruby's struggle to rebuild the farm complements Inman's chapters of the film.Overall, Cold Mountain is a marvel in film making and is one of this years best films. The three leads are excellent, as are the supporting players and cameos. Cold Mountain is well directed and well made. My only fault is that it could have been edited slightly but the time passes quickly anyway. 9/10",Cold Mountain
352,c75,I'm A 21 Year Old Guy! I Don't Cry At Films!!!,10,16 January 2004,"Whilst not perfect, I thought this was a film full of beautiful and moving moments and the simple fact is that I had tears in my eyes at 4 or 5 points during the film and, whatever comments or criticisms I can have, nothing can change the fact that I was deeply moved from this film.I think one of the biggest perceived criticisms of the film (i.e. the fact Inman and Ada barely know each other film) is the very thing that makes it such a beautiful, moving idea.   I really loved the idea that someone could be going through such a terrible time and the only source of hope that I have is not even, as such a person, but the image and idea of a person who they don't even really know.I found Ada's letters to Inman extremely touching and the sense of longing throughout the film is absolutely staggering heart-wrenching although, to be truthful, this sense of longing also does cause problems with the film's end as the hope and longing can never live up to to the final realisation.Elsewhere, Natalie Portman has the single saddest, sweetest moment of the film in a brief but outstanding cameo while Philip Seymour Hoffman adds brilliant comic relief.   Renee Zelwegger must surely be a strong contender for the Best Supporting Actress nods at the Oscars and elsewhere.True, the ending has its problems, true the chemistry between Jude Law and Nicole Kidman does not entirely work and Law gives a strangely muted performance (I don't mean in the sense that the character doesn't speak much, although he doesn't, but that Law does not give as strong an impression as the character as you might expect from such a talented actor).But, when a film is as moving and brilliant in its conveyal of the horrors of war and when I enjoy virtually an entire two and a hour film - I'm a firm believer that there is seldom ANY excuse for making film more than 120 minutes - all quibbles seem minor.",Cold Mountain

354,peacefrogx,did Minghella even read the book?,9,27 December 2003,"First off - let me state that I enjoyed this film very much. Now...let me begin my rant.  I understand that every book or novel that is turned into a movie is subject to screenplay interpretations and revisions;  a custom tailoring, if you will.  But in the beginning, at the very touchstone of any screenplay of a successful novel, there must be the essence of the author's intention by which to proceed forward from.  In the case of ""Cold Mountain"" it is just that - Cold Mountain.  The book's central theme - it's essence - was Inman's love of home and longing for it's simpler life (back in Cold Mountain, NC) and THEN his love for Ada.  I'm not downplaying that a major major theme of the book was the lovestory of Inman for Ada and vice-verca - and of course, the movie played that to the hilt.  However, to ignore or at the very most make scant reference to, Inman's love of home and life back in Cold Mountain does the book and the moviegoer a great injustice.Another theme (a central one at that) was Inman's abhorrence to the war and his own disgust with himself for his loss of innocence through his horrific experiences.  I understand the time restrictions and limitations of film, but to barely develop the author's true characterization of Inman will leave those who did not read the book prior to seeing the film at a loss of why Inman was such a righteous man BEFORE the war.It's interesting to think what Minghella would have done if given Homer's The Odyssey instead of Cold Mountain to direct.  Would he choose to ignore the near god-like status that Homer betroths upon Odysseus throughout his epic and rush to  put him in the sack with Kidman's fair-headed Penelope? Would he skip the Sirens and the Lotus Eaters in favor of a more violent encounter with the Swineherd?Probably.",Cold Mountain

I rather enjoyed the entire film.If you're in the mood for a good love story, this may just be the thing.",Cold Mountain
357,Gandalf35,Civil War accurately portrayed?,1,28 August 2004,"This movie was filled with tiresome clichés dressed up as an historical portrait of the South.To begin with it buys into the fallacy that the Civil War was primarily about slavery when it only became about that in the history books after the Union forces won. Some glaring historical facts support this such as the fact that Lincoln did not ""free the slaves"" until at least two years into the war and then he only freed the Southern slaves. Ulysses Grant - general of the Union forces - had slaves during the war whereas General Lee did not.In the South blacks fought alongside the whites. Whereas in the North they had their own segregated regiment - ""eulogized"" in the movie ""Glory"" with Matthew Broderick - as the union men did not want to fight alongside ""darkies"".The people of New York rioted and killed blacks after Lincoln's emancipation decree - somewhat accurately portrayed in the movie ""The Gangs of New York.""All these facts fly in the face of the ""death to all abolitionists"" line in the movie Cold Mountain - when in fact there were many abolitionist organizations in the South. These facts fly in the face of the seeming ignorance people in the movie have as to the battle cry of the South when one says ""last time I checked the south was a direction"". As if someone in the South - who voted overwhelmingly for succession - would not understand that the war was about the independence of states and their rights. They fought against the tyranny of the North to force their will on other states simply because they had more guns. Like most I am glad slavery died but let us not pretend that this was nobly achieved as the central cause behind the American Civil War - or more accurately The War of Northern Aggression.",Cold Mountain
358,oschaefe,A chilling vision of a tragic era,8,22 August 2005,"'War movie' is a Hollywood genre that has been done and redone so many times that clichéd dialogue, rehashed plot and over-the-top action sequences seem unavoidable for any conflict dealing with large-scale combat. Once in a while, however, a war movie comes along that goes against the grain and brings a truly original and compelling story to life on the silver screen. The Civil War-era ""Cold Mountain,"" starring Jude Law, Nicole Kidman and Renée Zellweger is such a film.Then again, calling Cold Mountain"" a war movie is not entirely accurate. True enough, the film opens with a (quite literally) quick-and-dirty battle sequence that puts ""Glory"" director Edward Zwick shame. However, ""Cold Mountain"" is not so much about the Civil War itself as it is about the period and the people of the times. The story centers around disgruntled Confederate soldier Inman, played by Jude Law, who becomes disgusted with the gruesome war and homesick for the beautiful hamlet of Cold Mountain, North Carolina and the equally beautiful southern belle he left behind, Ada Monroe, played by Nicole Kidman. At first glance, this setup appears formulaic as the romantic interest back home gives the audience enough sympathy to root for the reluctant soldier's tribulations on the battlefield. Indeed, the earlier segments of the film are relatively unimpressive and even somewhat contrived.""Cold Mountain"" soon takes a drastic turn, though, as the intrepid hero Inman turns out to be a deserter (incidentally saving the audience from the potentially confusing scenario of wanting to root for the Confederates) and begins a long odyssey homeward. Meanwhile, back at the farm, Ada's cultured ways prove of little use in the fields; soon she is transformed into something of a wilderbeast. Coming to Ada's rescue is the course, tough-as-nails Ruby Thewes, played by Renée Zellweger, who helps Ada put the farm back together and, perhaps more importantly, cope with the loneliness and isolation the war seems to have brought upon Ada.Within these two settings, a vivid, compelling and, at times, very disturbing portrait of the war-torn South unfolds. The characters with whom Inman and Ada interact are surprisingly complex, enhanced by wonderful performances of Brendan Gleeson as Ruby's deadbeat father, Ray Winstone as an unrepentant southern ""lawman,"" and Natalie Portman as a deeply troubled and isolated young mother. All have been greatly affected and changed by ""the war of Northern aggression,"" mostly for the worse. The dark, pervading anti-war message, accented by an effective, haunting score and chillingly beautiful shots of Virginia and North Carolina, is communicated to the audience not so much by gruesome battle scenes as by the scarred land and traumatized people for which the war was fought. Though the weapons and tactics of war itself have changed much in the past century, it's hellish effect on the land is timelessly relevant.Director Anthony Minghella manages to maintain this gloomy mood for most of the film, but the atmosphere is unfortunately denigrated by a rather tepid climax that does little justice to the wonderfully formed characters. The love story between Inman and Ada is awkwardly tacked onto the beginning and end of the film, though the inherently distant, abstracted and even absurd nature of their relationship in a way fits the dismal nature of the rest of the plot.Make no mistake, ""Cold Mountain"" has neither the traits of a feel-good romance nor an inspiring war drama. It is a unique vision of an era that is sure not only to entertain but also to truly absorb the audience into the lives of a people torn apart by a war and entirely desperate to be rid of its terrible repercussions altogether.",Cold Mountain
359,johnny-wales,"Long, rambling, pointless and depressing",1,26 February 2005,"Maybe I missed something, but this was one of the 20 worst movies I've ever seen. Every time you get attached to a character in the least, this random band of 5 murderers comes along and kills them. Why didn't somebody just shoot those Home Guard fellas if everybody knew they were just coming around to kill you and rape your family? There was not a single redeeming quality about the plot of this movie. It started out depressing, got more depressing, looked up for 1 day in movie time, then it got REALLY depressing. Living in the South, I've heard stories all my life about how terrible things were back then, about how there was no real government for a long time there, and there were constant murders and lynchings surrounding the war. But this really took that theme to an unbelievable and ridiculous extreme. Don't waste your time, you'll just wind up feeling like all the life got sucked out of you.",Cold Mountain
360,emilywildes,beautiful story but has credibility stretch,9,16 June 2005,"I thought this was a beautiful and strong story with excellent performances by the entire cast. In one instance I thought believability was stretched for the sake of a dramatic moment, but forgivable for the otherwise flawless film that this is. Renee Zellweger delivers what I think is her best performance. Kidman is stunning as the belle who has to learn to manage on her own. Her frustration at her upbringing which has made her a ""refined lady"" but almost useless in the harsh times the war brings comes across and really helps the viewer see her as a whole person. She easily have been a very flat character only serving to move along the plot for the others (unfortunately many female so-called leads are written that way)--but is not. This film is able to pull many different emotions as the characters struggle. Since historical epics are coming around like TROY and now KINGDOM OF HEAVEN, this one is great as a short epic of the ending of the Civil War for many of the same reasons the Odyssey was of the Trojan War.",Cold Mountain

Script, direction, cinematography were all perfect. Nicole Kidman is great in it. But the real winners of this movie are Jude Law and Renee Zellwegger. Renee was great as Ruby and she fully deserves the Oscar nomination. And i think it's time to recognize Jude Law who is the perfect cast for Inman. It was also nice to see Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Donald Sutherland and even in a very brief role Cilian Murphy. Overall, i rate 7.5 out of 10.",Cold Mountain

I consider this the equal of many grand romances, and war dramas that have gone before, especially about the Civil War. The opening battle sequence is nothing short of astonishing.

First, he destroyed The English Patient, which was bad enough, but now I discover he's butchered Cold Mountain - butchered!!!I had such a strange reaction to The English Patient. My son and I went to see it the first weekend it was released, and I was so disappointed, but told my son I felt like I needed to read the book. I drove straight to Barnes and Noble, bought it, read it, and tried to figure out what in the world the critics were talking about when they said Minghella had trusted enough in the intelligence of the movie-going public to give them a great film. That is what he most surely did not do. I do not ordinarily read a great deal of fiction, but Cold Mountain was so highly recommended by friends that I felt compelled to read it. I did not see Cold Mountain, the movie, when it played in theaters, and it was because of what Minghella had done to The English Patient. But like a fool, I rented it today, and I'm so upset, I had to vent my frustration and, most of all, my sadness, that someone could have taken this beautiful story and crafted it into something almost as beautiful on the screen, and now they never will. READ THE BOOK AND LET THE MOVIE ROT ON THE SHELF. I will never be taken in by a Minghella project again. I think he may be one of the worst directors working today, and I'm tired of the praise Hollywood heaps upon his head. It must be that no one in Hollywood reads anymore. This movie bears no resemblance to the book, except for the names of the characters. Minghella's ego must know no bounds, and if he didn't like the book, then why didn't he write an original screenplay and leave the book alone. Even if I hadn't read the book, I would still consider this movie one of the worst I've seen from 2003; and I've seen almost everything that's been released for viewing in the USA.Elaine, you aren't going to like this one either.",Cold Mountain

Just boring and never goes anywhere.  Sorry, the Miramax folks will probably promote the thing for awards but those who vote know nothing about movies.

368,redleigh86,It was better than I expected.,5,23 December 2003,"First, I have to explain the one line summary above. The only reason I saw this movie was because the theater I work for was screening Cold Mountain and Peter Pan the same day and I didn't want to go home so I stayed for the first screening (Cold Mountain) just so I could go straight to the Peter Pan screening in the adjacent theater. So, having said that, I think it's obvious I didn't really want to see it. I don't like war movies and I'm not a huge fan of Nicole or Renee (I do, however, like Jude). It was better than I had expected, of course that doesn't mean I think it's a good movie, I'm just a the-glass-is-half-full kind of girl. Another way to put it would be that the movie isn't as stupid and lame as I had expected. Judging by the previews I assumed there would be a lot of battle sequences. Well, there really wasn't but the battle scenes that were in the movie were some of the most horrifying and grotesque I've seen (and I have seen quite a few). The movie seemed way too long as it jumped back and forth from the character's present day to the character's past and then jumped from Jude's story to Nicole's story. It all seemed very tedious and there were some scenes that could have been left out to make the movie much shorter and not so boring. Nicole's American Southern accent is not very good, Renee is somewhat entertaining and the highlights of the film were all the close-ups of Jude's rear end. And, as much as I enjoy seeing Jude naked, the sex scene was much too long as well. The whole premise was a bit unbelievable (they go through these great ordeals after having known each other for only a few days) and there were a lot of scenes that were a bit unbelievable as well. Then again, this is a movie and its sole purpose is to provide entertainment, which it does at times. I don't suggest seeing this movie unless you're a great fan of the actors, of love stories, or just need to kill three hours. I gave it a 5/10.",Cold Mountain

What makes this even more irritating is the fact that the acting is so strong, that the audience would have understood the horrors of war so much better if the director had allowed the actors to do their work.  I can't blame the director for the ending, that's the author's contrivance, but that's what it is, utterly predictable, hokey and contrived.  The script at best is an excuse to allow a whole bunch of fine actors do some thankless, but brilliant character work.",Cold Mountain
372,wie_ein_wilder_stier,One of the best war movies,8,22 August 2011,"My mother told me that I would probably not like ""Cold Mountain"", because the love story in it, the romantic part would be too big for a male audience. But I have nothing against a nice romantic part, as long as it does not get corny or is filled up with bad clichés. ""Cold Mountain"" does not.The focus of this movie is war. Every scene seems to be connected with the civil war and like ""Saving Private Ryan"" showed us the cruel nature or World War II, ""Cold Mountain"" shows the cruel nature of any war, led by human fate and desire.The battle scene at the beginning makes ourselves think: why should anyone go voluntary to war? Jude Law's character refuses to go and he deserts. Now, it is like the Greek story of Odysseus. He needs to go through a strange scenery and country and of course the military is hunting him because of his desertion.Meanwhile, we see Nicole Kidman and Renee Zellweger back home at the plantation. This part could become a true cliché, but it does not, because the audience needs a refuge of the war. It is quit peacefull, until the war strikes there, too. But in fact, the civil war did not elide any part of the country or any person at all. Everyone gets tortured, psychically or physically. Or both like the Jude Law character.I liked ""Cold Mountain"" because of its universal message about war. What is war? This movie does not say yes or no to one party, it just shows the nature of war and how it horrors. No way out.Another positive point was the work of the director of photography, John Seale. He gives them all an epic touch. Director and writer Anthony Minghella did nothing wrong and I found it almost surprising that ""Cold Mountain"", a movie with no Best Picture nomination at the annual Academy Awards is in fact such an essential war movie that contains without any doubts to the best of his genre.The actors are also very well. Law, Kidman, Zellweger and Ray Winstone.

It's only after the appearance of Renee Zellwegger as the mountain woman Ruby Thewes that the picture becomes interesting. If nominated in the best supporting actress category, Zellwegger will be hard to beat this year. The film strives so hard to be epic in scope that the intimacy is often lost. ""Cold Mountain"" is a good film, but could have been a very good one had it been edited down to under two hours by chopping out much of the military violence.Nicole Kidman as Ada is not asked to do much. Jude Law as Inman has the more physical and challenging role and is outstanding. The supporting cast is also excellent.One of my friends loved the film.

I was most impressed with Anthony Minghella's ability to clearly capture the emotional plight of a variety of characters on screen. Jude Law was great as Inman. The internal nature of this character makes this an extremely difficult role, and Jude succeeded most of the time in conveying the emotions of Inman. Nicole Kidman was good but not great in her role as Ada Monroe. I thought the accent and the fact that she is Nicole Kidman made her seem out of place at time, but overall she gives an effective performance. Her transformation and ability to not beg for sympathy from the viewers was most impressive to me. Rene Zellweger really stole the show. She was in total control of her character (Ruby Thewes) and served as not only witty but really spiritual relief. Her character was so complex and well developed it was very easy to forget the fact that she was being played by Rene. The supporting cast (Kathy Baker, Natalie Portman, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Brendan Gleeson, Eileen Adkins) in general was incredible. They really shaped the movie as a whole.

375,varenya1,Thinly Disguised Chick Flick,5,2 January 2004,"Despite the ads showing the Battle of the Crater, anything looking like the Civil War only appears in the first few minutes of the film. The rest of this depressing film has the feel of a western. The plot is episodic, with Inman drifting from one encounter with a colorful character (more colorful than him) to another.  None of these encounters propel the plot or change him.  Meanwhile, the perpetually glamorous Ada, looking like nothing from the 1860's, is given a lesson in how to survive by Ruby. Aside from feminist feel-good, what does this have to do with the theme of waiting for Inman? Speaking of which, there's no explanation of why the two are so intent on reestablishing a relationship based on one kiss. Is she a beacon of comfort for a brutalized war veteran?  Is he the only eligible batchelor in the back woods? The movie doesn't address motives aside from a patently ridiculous romantic obsession.  And then there's the villains. The Home Guard seems to enjoy killing every stranger they find. Why?  What's in it for them?  The movie is handsome, it seems to have a grand theme, whatever it may be, and looks like a serious, major film. Problem is, the movie isn't really about anything other than two people getting back together. The grander themes of the Civil War, such as liberty or self-determination, don't play into it. In fact, if it weren't for the occasional grossly brutal scene, it would be boring.  What was Minghella thinking?",Cold Mountain

377,spikey01,"Overblown, Tedious, Boring Melodrama",1,28 December 2003,"Kidman and Law lack the chemistry to make this sloppily directed, poorly written romance/melodrama work on any level other than grandiosity. Kidman pouts andpines wistfully for her absent lover Law. She's just met him when he's whisked off to do battle for the South in the Civil War, and they've only exchanged about 5 sentences and one kiss, yet they're totally smitten. Law's main direction throughout seems to be `Look vacant and shell-shocked, but sensitive.' Rene Zellweger is about the only spark in this dreary script, but she plays it way too broad and over the top, like she was starring in `Annie Get Your Gun.' Yee-hah boy howdy! Something about her character felt more like it belonged in a Monty Python sketch - the one from `Holy Grail' where the peasants spend all their time wallowing in muck making mud pies for no reason. Kidman is a smart enough actress to stay out of her way whenever she can. Their scenes together are like a comic book hidden inside a Victorian Era novel.Whenever the action bogs down into total tedium, which is frequently, all the writers do is shout `Cue the Simon Legree-type Villain!' and Teague (Ray Winstone) comes galloping out of nowhere to do his unspeakably dastardly acts, like kill and torture innocent God-fearing townspeople in the name of loyalty to a fast-fadingConfederacy. All other times, he's missing in action, which is preposterous even in this cornball script. There is a plethora of other talented actors who give credible performances in small roles. These are the characters Law meets as he does his Johnny Appleseed trek from the front lines, where he has deserted, to the hopefully loving embrace of Kidman back in Cold Mountain. Ultimately though, none of these characters matter. Law has no time for them or their lives. Each of these little mini-movies has the same tired theme: war is gol-durn heck, and turns otherwise decent Christian folk into rabid animals.And the script is far too predictable, too heavy-handed. Moreover, the pacing of the story is dreadfully slow. You spend the entire movie waiting for Romeo and Juliet's inevitable reunion, with Kidman wringing her hands and sighing, Law overcoming incredible odds and dodging bullets. And when it finally comes you just don't care anymore. You'll be looking at your watch wondering how much more of this clap you have to endure.I give it one star out of five for the battle scenes. There is a potent anti-war message here. The incredible lack of concern for the loss of life by the Generals on both sides of the conflict is powerful stuff.

'The Lord of the Rings' series has not won before and it is not likely that it will win this time because of it's content and predecessors. The Academy have never given Best Picture to Fantasy picture and they have never given it to a sequal unless the first installment won (Godfather part II should've been Chinatown) and it doesn't look like they'll do it this time.'Cold Mountain' is a sweeping romantic epic and a five star visual acheivement with stand-out performances and stunning music. Even though it is not as critically loved as LOTR it is exactly the period romantic tales that the Academy love and how can this Film be snubbed when it has the Oscar giant Miramax throughing 100% of it's support behind it this year (They won last year when they had three film's to support: 'Chicago'(won)'Gangs of New York' and 'The Hours'. It also has a previous Oscar winner at the helm, Anthony Minghella.Now to the picture itself: 'Cold Mountain'is a beautifully constructed re-entry into the great romantic epics of old (my personal favourites of which are: 'Gone with the Wind','Doctor Zhivago')The lead performances from Nicole Kidman and Jude Law are impeccable, but admittidely the supporting players slightly steal the show especially Renee Zellweger (my Best Sup. Actress pick) and Natalie Portman (I don't think she got enough rcognition for this role). The Technical sides of this film are also amazing: John Seale's cinematography, Dante Ferreti's art/set direction (should've won last year for 'Gangs'),Ann Roth's costume design, Walter Mursch's editing and most of all Gabriel Yared's amazing score (I'm listening to the soundtrack now)Many people on this site have complained about the violence and sexuality, but that's what films need these days, realism (that's what it was like back then, times were tough)Now for all the offended LOTR fans out there I do like the LOTR series (I thought Fellowship of the Ring would win over a beautiful mind anyday, But to all you blinded fan's out there just think was ROTR really going to be able to compete with Oscar's fav. genre, Romantic Epics ???And I just think that Cold Mountain is a bigger individual acheivement while ROTR is just really a continuation (would it be so successful critically if it was the only LOTR movie released? (I think Peter Jackson should get an honorary oscar for the overall acheivement of the series rather than just a fragment of it (all be it a very impressive fragment). When you think about it the more likely choice for best picture out of the LOTR series would be FOTR because it could at least stand as a movie with a beginning and an endIn conclusion: Cold Mountain 9/10 The Return of the King 9/10Thankyou and may the best movie win.............'Cold Mountain'",Cold Mountain

380,yxcool,Cold Mountain tells a story happened during American Civil War:,7,29 March 2005,"Cold Mountain tells a story happened during American Civil War: Young Inman(Jude Law) fell in love with beautiful Ada(Nicole Kidman) in a place called Cold Mountain. But Inman decided to leave and fight with the Confederate Army when the civil war broke out. As the years pass, Ada struggles on her deceased father's farm with Ruby (Renne Zellweger), a doughty girl who assisted Ada along way, they had to work extremely hard to survive from the harsh environment and protect themselves from the Home Guards bullies who left behind the war. Meanwhile injured Inman received a letter from Ada and he realized that he had enough pointless slaughter, so he tried to go back to his spiritual land- Cold Mountain and beloved Ada. Inman had to walk through the dangerous and unstable south, cross the mountains without let the pursuing Union Army find him. On the way of his unforgettable and perilous odyssey, he met a lone line of interesting people who suffered from the war in different ways. When finally Inman arrived to Cold Mountain and married Ada, an irreparable tragedy happened: Inman lost his life during a conflict with the Home Guards, but Ada faced her miserable future bravely with her friends. The movie clearly expressed its theme- the ruthlessness of the brutal war by showing audience two different parts' stories: the journey of Inman and Ada's hard life back in Cold Mountain. Examples: On the way home, Inman suffered from starvation, injuries and frustration; Back in Cold Mountain, Ada the genteel intellectual had to face the real world on her own for the very first time, all she could do was to create the refuge herself or to die. The story contains some interesting characters that have distinctive personalities. E.g. a beautiful and well educated young lady was forced to run a farm, something she knows absolutely nothing, she was waiting to die in the beginning, was fortunately saved scrappy Ruby. And then she turns 180 and shown great determination to survive. There are some people like Ada in the real life: could be very depressive in a special moment, but when once activated by someone or something, they could change the way of attitude and do really well. Obviously, Ada's special personality made the story more interesting and extend-able; the next good example should be Ruby, she has a resisting personality, it shown by her dialogs like ""oh, I am better than any men!"" and actress' great performance like her complex emotion when found her father has been shot. So Ruby was also an important role of connecting and extending stories. The movie used some remarkable techniques such as the repeating of flashback in the beginning, it shows the huge difference between the life in Cold Mountain and the life that Inman is having in the war. It worked with actor's incredible performance to made audience feel stronger of character's situation and created a sense of horror which could immediately draw audience' attention to the film. It also symbols how serious the movie is; cross cutting has been largely used through out the movie, it created the special structure of the film: starts with flash back, and then tells two different parts of story at the same time by kept cutting forth and back. The director used this structure was probably it deferred to the original form the story: the novel Cold Mountain by Charles Frazier. And it also successfully reinforced the meaning of the movie: on both side, they were all suffering but not giving up.There were also some impressive scenes in the movie: Scene one: when Ruby's father realized that Home Guards were came to kill them, he chose to play and sing a real nice song and hopes to soften their hearts. The pace of the scene was so slow in the beginning but was sudden turns to fast when the singing plan fails- they shot two members of the band. After that, the pace slowed right down and long still shots were used again to emphasis the death. it made the scene so shocking! Scene two: In the last part, whole ""family"" was sitting around the table, they were the survivors and everything seemed great. But from their faces, audiences could easily tell that none of them is happy, because they've all lost something from the war, things those will never come back. It once again strongly reinforced the powerful meaning of the movie and highlighted the main theme: ruthlessness of the war.Over all, I think it is a great movie and I really enjoyed watching it. Excellent acting performance, vivid personalities of characters, refined camera shots all linked by a nice storyline. The only regret I left was the pace of whole movie; it seemed a bit too slow to tell such a story. But anyway, this is good movie to watch. Recommended to everyone who interests in the movie.",Cold Mountain
381,matiasdlc,One of the most wonderful films i've ever watched!,10,2 May 2006,"Well, this movie...is something completely wonderful. Its script is very well done. Renée Zellweger makes an impressive performance, and Jude Law and Nicole Kidman also have good performances. I love the photography and the costumes. I guess i love this movie, because i love Renee Zellweger, who always makes excellent performances and leaves you with your mouth opened. Sorry if my vocabulary isn't very good, but i'm Argentinian, so it's difficult for me to talk exactly. The movie, makes you cry a lot and leaves a wonderful message... ""if you are in love with someone, no distance will ever be enough to separate u from that person you love...u can suffer and be hurt ed...but if you wait...you'll get what you always wanted""",Cold Mountain
382,lhansen14,A Must See!,9,18 April 2013,"First, I have to say that I fell in love with Cold Mountain from the moment the movie started. The power of Inman and Ada's relationship is apparent from the moment the two meet and their powerful connection does not fade the entire film. What is so captivating is that Inman and Ada only have a few encounters before Inman if forced to leave and fight in the Civil War. But those moments are enough and subsequently change them both forever. While Inman and Ada are separated by war, each face hardships of their own. The movie focuses a lot on the effects of war on those fighting as well as those left behind. It specifically focuses on how war can affect two people in love that want nothing more than to be reunited. After being wounded in battle, Inman finds himself removed from the battlefield, but he is still not free to return to Cold Mountain, where Ada is. Inman is now a deserter and is in almost as much danger as if he had remained on the battlefield. Inman continues to fight for his life as he tries to make it back to Ada, encountering several interesting people along the way. All Inman has left are the memories of Ada and a single picture. Unaware of what is going on with Inman, Ada faces struggles of her own in Cold Mountain. Her father dies, her house is falling apart, she barely has enough food or money to survive, and the town is destitute because of the war. Ada receives help from Ruby, sent to help by one of Ada's neighbors. Ruby knows how to work the farm Ada has let fall apart and is not shy about ordering Ada around. Ruby acts as a much needed comic relief to the otherwise intense and emotional parts of the film. Although the journey was not easy, Inman finally makes it back to Ada (what you wait for the entire movie!) but the couple soon faces tragedy and Ada is once again left alone. I was very impressed overall by the film. The setting, scenery, and costumes all work perfectly together and are not overdone. I also really liked that the film did not feel like a Civil War movie, even though the War was a major component. The focus is more on the development of the main characters and the difficulties they face as well as the unbreakable romance between Inman and Ada. Cold Mountain is a must see!!",Cold Mountain
383,robertclinton865,Surprising and beautiful,7,24 August 2014,"First, it is surprising that very little of the film is shot in North Carolina - and that the majority of it is actually filmed in the country of Romania! Having been to 'the real' Cold Mountain many times, one can see the similarities though. The landscape around the mountain is filled with the same type hillsides and hollers we see in the film.And honestly, even in 1860's character, Nicole Kidman has never looked more beautiful. She is very much like a porcelain doll come to life, and the perfect choice for this film - cause she nails this helpless yet proud character of Ada, her performance is virtually flawless. And even though Renee Zellwegger's character is a little irritating, but her performance is brilliant. The rest of the cast is well chosen and most acceptably fill their roles. Watch for Giovanni Ribisi and Kathy Baker, they are especially good. Ribisi brings his trademark 'weirdness' to a despicable character, and Baker is amazingly 'motherly'...The most upsetting thing about the film is the realistic and historically accurate portrayal of the disgustingly rancid 'home guard' - who in real life simply took advantage of the war (as an opportunity) to terrorize the countryside, humiliate or routinely murder personal enemies, and line their own pockets with impunity. As if the war wasn't bad enough, southern towns and communities had to endure it with this accompanying evil in the form of men purported to be patriotic to the cause - when all they were (were) violent criminals who deserved to die.",Cold Mountain

The story held my interest, though the end was predictable. Renée Zellweger was fresh, terrific and funny. Jude Law acted beautifully in his long-suffering role (best take some Prozac before watching). Nicole Kidman didn't move me, but she presented a coherent character.However, through my eyes, it didn't add up to anything fresh. Predictably, a bunch of really bad things happen and the people are all miserable. It's probably about the courage of the human heart, or some such thing. If you're having a good day, it's, ""love, no matter how brief, is worth fighting for."" On a down day, it's more like, ""give up your romantic fantasies and get on with your f**ing life."" If the message isn't important to you, and you love the craft of acting and pretty scenes, go for it. If you like romance and need a cathartic cry, try Somewhere in Time.For me, it was just people suffering (beautifully). By the end of the film, I felt sorry for the characters and the actors.

I absolutely adore Renee Zellweger in this film and find it chillingly haunting. A sadly beautiful ending, this movie will stay with me for a very long time. The length of the film might run a little long for some, but I enjoyed all of it. Why was this not nominated for 2003 Best Picture?

By ""exaggerating"", I am referring to the fact that Inman literally survived a shot to the neck, and got shot later on as well, but couldn't handle that last bullet in the end. First of all, I believe that the acting was incredible, the scenery was astonishing, and the portrayal of war is somewhat realistic. What I couldn't understand however was the point of Inman travelling all that way just to die in the arms of a woman he hardly knew, he did admit that he hardly knew her, but then why? What made Monroe so special that someone like Inman would take immediate interest in her? A quarter of this movie involves Inman thinking about Monroe and how much he wants to see her, but his reaction to seeing her in the end is weak. 8/10 stars from me, because of the missing pieces, highly recommend this movie.",Cold Mountain
389,charmedaddict666,Not Everything It Was Made Out To Be - But Good.,7,12 August 2007,"This movie is one of those that was built up just a little too much. Don't get me wrong, I did like it - but it was 2 and a half hours and some of it just didn't seem to flow as well as I thought it would.The whole thing was touching and lovely, if a slight boring. To me other films that I have enjoyed (I won't list since this is about Cold Mountain, nothing else) which involved the characters falling in love and beating the odds have found two actors who have a lot of on-screen chemistry. So much that you just want to leap off of your chair and grab them and bang their heads together and you even get butterflies of frustration when things don't go that way.But, Jude Law (Inman) and Nicole Kidman (Ada) just didn't give me that feeling. They're characters were too rushed it seemed and when 'that' kiss happened it was too predictable and too cheesy for a film with such a bitter under taste of death and depression.The film picked up, though, I thought when Renée Zellweger was introduced as the charming Ruby Thewes. Her character had a lot of depth but you weren't bored to tears by her past but instead were intrigued into why she was the way she seemed but at the same time you just enjoyed her on-screen time. And also when Phillip Seymour Hoffman took up the role as the priest with his roving eye and the love for that saw I had to admit, I thought the film was getting good.Natalie Portman, Ray Winstone, Emily Deschanel, Kathy Backer and Brendan Gleeson all took up the other roles in the film, however short, and in their own ways added some sort of attributes to it. In my opinion if it had just been a love saga without other characters we could look at, I would have been bored to tears (And I actually like those kinds of films.) And though the film was supposed to be focused on Nicole Kidman and Jude Law's characters love, I'm afraid to say that all my attention was on Renée Zellwegers characters development with Georgia and how their relationship would work. Screen chemistry is a must for me and if I can't see any then it's not worth the £15.99 I paid for it.There were good bits in this film though, some acting (Not Jude Law's best attempt, though it has to be said he didn't have many lines), the scenery, the battle sequences and the fact we went back and forth for a while which kept my attention. What didn't keep my attention was the fact they could have told the story in 2 hours instead of boring me with other sequences that didn't need to be there.The ending was predictable although it was raved about being ""very shocking and unexpected."" I felt sorry, almost, for Jude Law. He had around a page worth of lines and didn't even get a hero's ending as the poor bugger went and died. Quiet pathetically in my opinion, please don't let him die in other films. (He just can't act) I'd give it a 7/10 - and thats because I loved the Ruby character.",Cold Mountain

Never have I met anyone with an accent like Nicole Kidman's. That, and an overt awareness that they were ACTING, placed this movie in my personal ""eh"" file. The only character that makes this movie watchable for me is Renee Zellweger. This movie should not have been made with major Hollywood stars from England and Australia. This story deserves real Southerners, and emerging stars who don't divert focus from what is otherwise a beautiful story.Read the book instead.

There are far better romantic films out there, and far better war films (Band of Brothers, Saving Private Ryan). As graphic as those war movies are, they weren't sadistic like this one. The Renee Zellwegger character was pretty amusing, and the scenery was pretty but that isn't enough of a compensation for the gross stuff.

But don't get me wrong, Minghella delivers every bit of a grand epic and for those who enjoy that kind of experience and are willing to take that adventure and accept what comes as just that, then they will not be disappointed and it will be one of the better films of the year in their opinion.  The acting is of a high quality and will most likely come away with a trinity of oscar noms for Law, Kidman and Zellweger, even though Portman's few scenes may be the most powerful in the film.  The locations are beautiful and Minghella has an eye for a good shot.However, for those like me who want the director to take them on the adventure instead of going willingly may come away disappointed mainly due to Minghella and his adaptation.  The film is so utterly bleak it makes for what I consider to be a punching bag epic which is a film that that tries to hit hard with emotion but does so to such an extreme and so often that during the film I didn't have the time to emotionally invest, or hadn't recovered from a previous blow, and it became unrealistic and consequently too difficult to really care, not to mention predictable. Overall the ""Cold Mountain"" almost left me too drained to even think back on the good aspects of the film, as all I remember is death, which may have been an original motif but ends up being the focus instead of the characters.",Cold Mountain

There was no build up to the characters.  The kid that dies I guess was suppose to make us cry...but for some reason it just irritated everyone.  Then we have to listen to line after line of sappy dialog that tried desperately to mimic ""Wuthering Heights"", which of course was also quoted in the movie.  Go figure.  There was nothing original about the movie at all, it was like sitting through the most mundane parts of every war movie ever made, with a little bit of humor thrown in to keep you hoping that it was going to get better.  Sadly it doesn't.  3 hours later, I leave the theater feeling cheated.  Anthony Menghilla should be shot for trying to duplicate the English Patient, which for it's time was a good movie, but now I wonder....should I rent it and make sure I wasn't just caught up in the HYPE???

Renee' Zellweiger added some great moments to this movie, the character added humour & contrast-her relationship with Kidman was very, very strong and quite touching.

The peaceful Southern countryside has an almost mystical air, of some far-off legend which cannot exist in the modern world. There is plenty of action and heroism, and a suitably grand battle scene to end things. It's all been done before, but this does not mean the movie is not entertaining.The one problem I have had was the over-use of cheap devices to provoke emotion, which had the action bordering on melodrama on several occasions. We don't need slow, sad music and slow-motion footage every time some character dies or gets hurt. Subtly inserting emotional content is one thing, but this film takes it and beats you over the head with it, then shoves it down your throat. It felt rather insulting and unnecessary, almost like the sad equivalent of a laugh track. But perhaps it was just me.",Cold Mountain

I've heard some  people say that it was the best part of the whole movie, and I thought it was a poorly  edited confusing mess...I.E. they are right and it is better than most of the rest of the  movie. Nicole and Jude's characters completely bored me. I didn't give a crap about  either of them and didn't believe they were in love for one second. Nicole had more  chemistry with that rooster than with Jude. Nicole is incredibly miscast in this movie. I didn't believe her in this roll. It is easily her worst performance that I've seen, and I've  seen Birthday Girl. Jude was a lot better than Nicole and was pretty good in some  scenes, but I still just couldn't connect with his character at all and just like Nicole, his  accent was very questionable in many parts. People were trying to kill him and I really  just couldn't have cared less if he lived or died. Nicole and him lacked any chemistry at all in the beginning scenes so it was impossible for me to understand how he could risk  death to just see her again ""for 10 minutes."" This is the kind of movie you have to care  about the lead character for it to work, and I down right hated them for the most part. I  was more emotionally connected to just about everyone else in the movie than Ada and  Inman. Even some of the bad guys that I wasn't supposed to like. Horrible editing,  cheesy dialogue (I call this nail 'Northern aggression.'), painfully melodramatic, repetitive, lifeless lead characters, uninspired directing, and just plain BORING. There is  only one thing that saves this from being even worse than TEP...Renee. You only really  comprehend how dull everybody else's performances are when Renee absolutely puts  them all to shame. She is the highlight of every scene she is in and saves the movie from  being completely unwatchable. I absolutely loved her and I hope she wins the Oscar.They should have just made a Ruby movie because the rest is a complete waste of time.

Although I do admit that the plot has been performed many many times before, Anthony Minghella is able to bring in different aspects to keep the story unique. The story does not only focus on the main love plot and the viewer is not over-stuffed with tacky romance and cheesy catch phrases. The entire time I watched this movie all i wanted was for Nicole Kidman and Jude Law's characters to get together. Both deliver amazing performances, and as always, Jude Law looks immaculate and Nicole Kidman is able to make the audience cry with just one look. The surprising actress for me was Renee Zelwegger. Having mostly seen her in comedic roles, I did not expect much from her. Her performance, however, is simple but extremely powerful. Although I admit that I did cry the entire movie, and through the credits, the movie is beautifully presented and pain-stakingly desperate love story. Some may say that this has been done before, but with the amazing cast and unique directing, there are many factors that set this movie apart from the rest. I say: watch it!

So those of you who haven't read it should take my comments with a grain of salt.One of the best things about the novel was the lack of schmaltz. There, the relationship between Ada and Inman was secondary to Inman's travels and Ada's coming into her own -- yet always there was the potential for love. Focusing on the character development -- and hinting at this potential -- made sense because Inman and Ada really didn't know each other before their separation, yet through the years each developed in a way that could only add to their compatibility. I looked forward to their reunion knowing that it had become logical for them to be together. That's romantic. In the movie, however, it was presented as a given that they were each other's ""aine true love"" -- yet Minghella never did the heavy lifting of creating scenes that showed them actually getting to know each other -- just blushing and making googly eyes. So really all we knew is that they found each other hot. Instead of Inman clinging to the notion of Ada as ""home,"" and Ada finally arriving at the mature conclusion that she wanted to be with Inman, we saw a lot of pining after each other to the swelling of syrupy music. Please! If you want to see a true romance, watch Minghella's MUCH superior ""Truly Madly Deeply.""",Cold Mountain

To begin with Nicole Kidman's heavy makeup in the beginning of the movie would probably have had her branded as a prostitute in those days. Also, she was miscast and her acting was terrible. Jude Law tried, but again he along with the rest of the (mis)cast never evoked any emotion in me. Rene Zelweiger's acting was convincing, but reminiscent of Granny Clampett in the Beverly Hillbillies. The characters were one dimensional and even Natalie Portman's scene did little to arouse any emotion in me. Donald Sutherland was the best actor in the movie and he was gone during the first half hour!! The script was terrible and laden with clichés from the characters to the dialogue. Even when Inman and Ada meet again, a scene that shouldn't leave a dry eye in the house, it left me cold, as did his death at the end. I just didn't care because these characters and actors never invited me into their world.

I mean, name the last chick flick where two men cut up a cow in 'chapters' so that it could be moved more easily?Also, the near three hours of the movie seemed to go by like minutes.  I could have gone through another hour or so.Overall, I would give Cold Mountain a 9/10",Cold Mountain

There's nothing wrong with that, per se, but it would have been more honest of the filmmakers to release this as a Lifetime channel movie. But women should really be smarter than to fall for the cloying, nonstop, politically-correct BS-claptrap women's-lib business which is not the bulk of the film, but rather the film itself. It's almost worth watching for the breathtaking scenery, though. If you are a student of cinematography, a lesbian, or just a not-very-bright woman, there's no reason why you shouldn't enjoy it.

The acting, script, cinematography were abosuletly the best I had seen in a long, long time.  But what impressed me the most was how the whole cast played their characters and how the movie didn't really focus on just one actor or actress, but where everyone was important in the movie.I would like to say one thing about Nicole Kidman.  ""BRAVO !!"" for your role as a Ada Monroe.  In my humble opinion this is by far your greatest work. Keep up the great work.",Cold Mountain

More assets: Natalie Portman, Renee Zellweger (not that she's so great, but at least she tries hard, creates a memorable character - as opposed to Nicole Kidman - and injects some humor into the oh-so elevating story.On the minus side: no chemistry between the two main characters, occasionally awful dialogues, glossy and boring Ada, jarring accents.Altogether a rather tedious and overrated movie, IMO, with a few well acted scenes and believable images of fighting and dying.

415,Pinkgirlie001,This film would melt even the coldest of hearts.,10,12 April 2004,"Set during the American Civil War and comprising of an all-star cast, this romantic tragedy cannot fail to captivate. The story alternates its focus between Ada Goodman (Nicole Kidman), a young reverends daughter, and Inman (Jude Law), a wounded Confederate soldier.With the unexpected death of her father, Ada watches as their farm falls into disrepair, relying only on her letters to Inman to help her through the long winter. When Ruby (Renee Zellweger) wanders onto the farm one day offering help, an inseparable bond begins between the pair. With new found strength the two gradually put the farm back together, whilst secretly looking after Ruby's estranged fiddler father.Determined to make it back to Cold Mountain after three years of being separated from his beloved Ada, Inman uses the last of his strength to drag himself out of his hospital bed and onto the long road home. Encountering slaves, bounty hunters, deserters, women of the night and a witch along the way, Inman's journey is a slow and treacherous one.With a strong story (based on the novel by Charles Frazier) and excellent acting, this film would melt even the coldest of hearts.",Cold Mountain

I couldn't help wishing something different for she and the blanket-conscious soldier, but as a product of both the North and South, I'm used to such confusion.This movie is **not** an ""Ah, I'll rent it!""

418,twyllie,An excellent drama that captures the dangers of the day,10,2 January 2004,"Civil War films are of particular personal interest because of my many forbears who fought and died defending their homes.  The film opens with a dramatic re-enactment of the horrific Battle of the Crater. The necessary meanness that comes with combat is seen on both sides as well as acts of personal heroism. The Crater foreshadows the bloody battles of WWI and re-enactors will be engrossed. It is, however, a film about a Southerner's dangerous road home whether it was before or after the Surrender.Jude Law's performance is extraordinary.  Up until the 1950s when roads came to NC's mountains, people spoke a dialect closely resembling 18th century English; so his articulation is effective as this would have resembled the language spoken in England at that time.  He also captures the sense of the strong, quiet mountain man who is a formidable adversary but inept in the language of love. Zellweger's performance also celebrates the virtues and determination of a woman from the Smokies.  Her dialect, expression, and sentiments capture the heart of the clever and quick witted Carolinian of the day. There has been no better performance by a supporting actress. While most of the characters rely on 'types', those that are developed are well done.  The licentiousness of some characters seems a bit over the top. For example, the murderous minister's character (not the father) is the exception rather than the rule. Read Glasgow's ""Barren Ground"" for an accurate, fictional depiction of white landowners relationships with African Americans.The film's use of folk music is effective and helps develop the audience's understanding of Cole Mountain.  Was  surprised that the director did not use ""Imogene"" or ""In the Pines"" for the song played in the hospital.The announcement of war in the film is poorly done and unfair to Western North Carolinians.  If they celebrated they would have sung ""Dixie"" (a song I heard played at the end of every major evening event followed by hurrahs until about 1970, which is an appropriate time for that custom to die). The idiotic, visceral hollaring about war is just that. Many opposed the war. One forebear from a tobacco growing region argued in county debates in 1861 to remain with the Union. When defeated in debate he enlisted as a private to defend his homeland. In 1864, North Carolina's gubernatorial debate centered on whether or not to re-enter The Union. The secessionists narrowly won the election. And she was the state who lost more men in the conflict than any other Southern state. But many other parts ring true. Great-great uncle Vann died at the age of 12 as a bugle boy. All we have is a tin type of him in his uniform. Great-great Uncle Bill was murdered by a scalawag while trying to return home.  It was a time of great nobility of spirit and base profiteering.  Very few people today in either the North or South understand the ethos of the players in the War Between the States and this film brings us a bit closer, if by way of metaphor rather than history. The best still remains ""Birth of a Nation"".There is much more to be said for than against this film.",Cold Mountain
419,chasehunterj,This movie was just plain good.,9,6 January 2004,"Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zellweger all put a great deal of effort into this film and it has paid off well. I think critics will agree that Law is one of the better actors in this 21st century... oh yeah, and not bad at the box office either. Inman really seems like a reasonably realistic person of the time. The only problem in my mind, is would even a woman of the civil war times stick around for a man who she has seen for a very brief period of time and has kissed only once? That struck me as odd, but in the long run... I was not dissapointed when my sister dragged me into this one. B+ for this one.",Cold Mountain

Animals were not romanticized as they are today.  They were useful tools for labor and food.  Family and neighbors were necessarily close in order to survive the harshness of existence.

I enjoyed and loved the whole movie, from beginning to end, though there are some moments that, for me, are specially great: the first kiss between Inman and Ada (I didn´t expected it and breaks the ""coldness"" between the couple), the scene with the white pigeon in the church (shows Inman's sensibility), when Ruby appears (Renée Zellweger really surprised me, she is completely different from her other movies and makes a great performance), when Ada and Inman meet again, and of course the end, which I wish it was different but the truth is that it is absolutely perfect.",Cold Mountain

I cant understand why the movie wasn't nominated for an Oscar in the Best Picture Category, actually it was better than Master & Commander, with more places, better cinematography...I don't know.

Jude Law has an astonishing performance, but the real treasure in this film, even more than the story itself, is the one and only Renée Zellweger. There are no words to describe her performance as Ruby Thewes. She brings real life into this film. I think she is the true soul of COLD MOUNTAIN. I really believe she deserved the Oscar she won. I can´t think of nobody who could perform such a though role in such a splendid way. When she is on the screen we completely forget the also great actress Nicole Kidman.

The love story was so believable because of the harsh realities during times of brutal war. Nicole Kidman, Jude Law and Renee Zellweger were perfect for their parts. The movie had a good balance of drama, romance and a bit of humor. My husband even liked it and he is not too into love stories. The scenery in parts of this movie was spectacular. Jude Law did an amazing job of acting. He should have won that Oscar. This movie does have some harsh war scenes so if you are too squeamish this movie may not be one of your favorites.

429,dbarnes-6,"This movie works, but it is no ""Gone With The Wind""",7,30 July 2004,"This movie worked for me because I see this movie as an exact opposite of 'Gone With The Wind.' Farm owners instead of plantation owners. Scarlett fights and connives for what she wants; Ada gets depressed and turns inside herself until Ruby, (Renee Zellweger,) shows up to save the day. Sort of, in a round about way. Deserters instead of officers trying to get back to their families, the lists goes on and on. Even the love story was opposite. If this is what the producer and writers were trying to get across it succeeded with me. There are only two things I didn't like about the movie, the rest I thought was well done and I liked it enough to recommend it to friends. First, I couldn't see the attraction between Inman, (Jude Law), and Ada, (Nicole Kidman,) as being strong enough for Inman to desert to get back to her. Inman said he only had written to her a few times where Ada wrote to him almost constantly. Second, something or someone getting killed or dying in almost every scene was a little much. I must say it was full of action because of that, but after about the second scene I knew something or someone was going to die in the next scene. I like to be surprised by the next scene, not know what is going to happen before it does.I thought all the acting was very well done, with Zellweger the best. She deserved the credit she got for it. I thought she played the part of the hillbilly girl very well. She must have done her homework on the part. Zellweger even said in the movie that she was smarter than people thought she was. I think that was true. Law did well with his part with all he had to go through to get back to Kidman. It must have been a lot stronger love to go through all that than I thought it was. Now he showed a lot of emotion in his face during his trials. Kidman's part may have had something to do with the fact I chose her performance after the other two. Except when she was depressed she didn't show much emotion, I don't know if that is how the part was written or if that is how she perceived the part. She still did a good job, I just thought the other two were better. I liked the scene with the Zellweger, Kidman and the rooster, even though it was one of those scenes I mentioned above. I thought the 'Home Guard' was exactly as they probably were back then. Even though we don't hear much about them they were a part of that time. I thought the scenery was beautiful. The movie had everything needed to be a good historical romance.",Cold Mountain
430,neenienoonie,Very Dramatic movie with lots of violence.,8,14 August 2004,"This movie was very dramatic. A great performance from Jude Law, and Renee Zelweger. I think Nicole Kidman was a bit over the top. An appearance from Jack White of the band The White Stripes appears as Georgia, a fiddle playing band mate of Rudy's(zelweger) father. If a dramatic love story with a war tie in is what you crave, this is the movie for you. But there is much death and blood, and drinking, and major violence. It is not for the weak of heart. Definitely a movie that was really worked on, but its long like the lord of the rings, and i got a bit bored in the middle once nothing was happening, the end is where the most productive events happen. The ending is sweet and sad at the same time. See it for yourself and post here your views. see if you agree with me.",Cold Mountain
431,bhague-2,Moment of irony,6,29 December 2004,"It's very brief, but I couldn't help but wondering if the director meant us to see the irony. In the open battle sequence in the crater, there's a shot of Inman's Cherokee buddy struggling with a black Union soldier. To me, the image of the Native man and the African American man struggling to kill each other in a white man's war was deeply ironic, but perhaps unintended? I'd be interested in knowing if this was commented on in the book . . . Overall I though the technical quality of the film was quite high. Also, I was struck by how many Irish and English actors were used. Was this because their accents were closer to the way people in the American south spoke at the time, I wonder? I actually thought Law's performance was much more affecting than Nicole Kidman's. I think he did a nice job portraying a man who was swept up in events beyond his comprehension. And what's her name did a fine job as Ruby, just what was called for. I don't think her accent and mannerisms were over the top, rather they fit the character . . .",Cold Mountain

On the contrary, Inman escapes from the war in an attempt to reunite with the love of his life, Ada.

The battle starts with an explosion and then a fight breaks out. The battle shows the horror of the civil war. The battle has young men that are getting killed by guns and close combat. The battle shows how wars were fought back then, close combat fighting. Before the battle starts a flashback occurs to Cold mountain North Carolina were the main two main characters meet for the first time. Inman and Ada, they both like each other. Inman goes to fight in the war. Ada and Inman become separated. Inman becomes sick of the war and tries to find Ada. Inman is injured and starts his way home. After a long time of search Ada and Inman run into each other. After some tension Ada falls back in love with Inman. After a little while some enemy soldiers find them.

Cold Mountain also drove home the point that the Civil War tore families apart and left no real winners, as is apparent in the end of the film. This film also brings to light the point of view of the South during the Civil War, which is not as common as the north's side being shown; at least in my experience. It was interesting to see that Inman, a Southerner from North Carolina, did not believe in the South's cause, yet he chose to fight. I guess the director has a little bit of a Northern sentiment. I definitely thought that Ada's progression from dainty lady to tough farmer/outdoors- woman was realistic given the circumstances, although her hair was always a bit too perfect. I thought that the ending of the movie was fitting. The Civil War left no victors, and that had to include Inman and Ada. Cold Mountain was, in my opinion, an excellent film that showed the brutalities of the Civil War.",Cold Mountain
435,e-bouse,Film with long lasting impression (on me at least),7,25 July 2005,"I have not managed to completely block out this film from memory even though it has been two years since I've seen it.Don't get me wrong - I have long forgotten the main story line - the relationship between Kidman and Law, that made no impression on me but it was the torture scenes in the film that really struck me. I cried for about two hours straight after wards. It had never previously occurred to me how people, in war time, could take advantage of something as pure as a mother's love. We see several examples of this here - in both the scenes with Natalie Portman and with the mother with her fingers in the fence for keeping her son hidden at home. I was shocked at these scenes and will probably never watch the film again as a consequence because the scenes even now are perfectly clear in my mind. However, I am glad I watched the film simply because it has made me more aware to the horrors of war and the horrible cruelty that mankind can inflict on it's own. The blonde albino character has been top of my list of most evil bad guy ever since I saw the film. His horrible sneer and lack of any human feeling for the people he tortured really hit a nerve with me. At one point I wanted to get up in the cinema and kill him myself (see the movie pushed me over the edge of reason,it only occurred to me afterward that I'd only be hitting a big screen - that shows the film's power and intensity at least). I recommend the film for it's sheer experience not for the entwined love story but for the manner in which it depicts war without needing a battlefield.",Cold Mountain

So is the story - especially if you compare it to that of the novel. (I'm not writing this because I believe a film adaptation should be faithful to the book, but in this case, like so often, the difference in quality is outrageous.) The music is the usual fake, flashy, gushy Hollywood score (there are very few good score composers in Hollywood...) This film is not even worth writing more about it. Definitely made for the Oscar, but the Academy for the first time seemed to ignore the bribe of Miramax, and fortunately this film didn't win any important award - except for Renee's that was rather a compensation for Bridget Jones...

I don't fit any any of those classification. The other classification that needs to be on the list is 5) people didn't like this movie because it was not good. I found the film to be booring and forced. My wife picked it for us to see because she is a huge Kidman fan and she also likes Jude Law.Speaking of Law, it took a long time and a huge amount of suspension of belief for me to believe his southern accent. I can't help but wonder if they didn't make his character less talkative on purpose so we would't have to hear that tortured accent so much.As far as the movie, it took a long time for it to get interesting (about 1 or 1.5 hours), and then fell flat in it's ending. What was interesting, is that I did not know that this film was directed by Minghella. About 40 minutes into the movie, I asked my wife ""this isn't going to be another English Patient is it?"" It absolutely was.As far as the battle scenes. I'm trying to think of a word to describe the opening battle scene, but I think the most descriptive word that accurately describes it is simply ""dumb"". It was forced, it was unbelievable, it was silly and it was dumb. (After the battle I looked at my wife and asked ""was that just dumb?"" to which she vigorously nodded her head).The only bright point in the film was the performance of Zellweger. The role was a bit over acted like any decent comedy relief role, but it worked. From her speech pattern, her walk, her mannerisms and esp. her little quips (my favorite: ""If you want to get 3 feet up a bull's ass all you have to do is listen to sweethearts talk to each other""), she was able to create an almost cartoon-like character who did her job extremely well.I simply did not like this movie and I have to wonder about the kind of people who do say they like it (or the English Patient for that matter).

It's told with such intensity and it speaks right to your heart. All the time, you wish that they see each other again, you feel what Inman has to endure while he wanders through the woods. The actors are brilliant: Nicole Kidman as Ada, she embodies all the things - Ada's inability to cope with the situation that Inman is gone, the situation after her Dad is dead (she doesn't know how to cook or how to lead a farm); but also Jude Law: he plays the silent Inman so well, the one who never says much, so there are many things left unsaid. Renée Zellweger even received an Oscar for her performance of the farmer girl Ruby who helps Ada to get along. I think she really deserved it. Great movie! Watch it!",Cold Mountain
441,bunigirl,cold mountain,9,3 June 2006,"Anthony Mingella has captured the reality and feeling during the civil war. Although i have never read the book, i enjoyed watching the film. It made me think from the characters point of view and what it would have felt like for them,and what they would have felt.An effect which really caught my eye was how the first hour of the film was set in flashback. The dramatic change from violence in battle scenes to peace and tranquility back in cold moutain had an amazing effect on me and really caught my eye. It's as if Inman (jude law) is fighting on and on then thinking back on how life was before the war and each flashback holds more regret that Inman had signed up for the war in the first place.One thing that isn't so good about this film is that it drags on in places and is really a bit to long. People don't want to sit and watch a film for 2 and a half hour straight. As a 14 year old, i am not one to sit and concentrate on a certain subject for as long as 2 and a half hours. After about an hour and a half i begin to get bored and cold mountain is a film that needs full concentration right the way through.When ruby (renee zellweger) is entered into the film, it all of a sudden becomes more interesting and exciting. She manages to keep the film on a top level as she is entertaining. With renee zellweger, cold mountain would be slightly boring and highly stereotypical. I am a huge fan of renee and believe cold mountain is one of the best pieces of work she has done. Well done renee!!!!!!! Nicole Kidman plays the part of Ada very well. She is consistent through out and her acting typically fits her costume. Despite this, the chemistry between her and Inman (jude law) could have been much stronger. It seems a bit unreal that somebody would wait for four years to see the person they don't even know and only saw a few times and kissed once.Overall i think this film has been wonderfully casted and directed. Despite all of the bad things i have pointed out on this review, it is expected to be mistakes in a film on this subject. It was on of the most critical moments in American history. If somebody gave you the book of cold mountain and said "" Read this book and make a film on it. "" Would you be able to make a film anywhere near the quality that Anthony Mingella has produced? It was a big ask for him and therefore i believe he has done a fantastic job.",Cold Mountain
442,laclan29,Awesome and Educational at the same time,10,17 July 2006,"I loved this movie. First of all, Nicole Kidman was, awesome. She got the part down perfect. innocent yet somehow mysterious. Then there's Renee Zellweger. Number one, shes my favorite actress ever. Number two, Ruby Thewes is such a strong character. She is so supportive. And Number three, rock on Renee. I hope they make more movies like this in the future. You know before i watched this movie, had no idea about anything on the Civil War. Didn't know what treason, or the pain and agony that everyone went through. So i would just like to say that i got an educational and exiting lesson on history. There is so much drama and excitement in this movie. Also, the romance and tragedy blended to where it was depressing and joyous at the same time.",Cold Mountain
443,lazymouse8,"Not a Civil War movie, but a western",7,22 October 2006,"I thought this movie was going to be a Civil War epic, but it is actually more like a western. The pace is western (very slow), the shots are western (big landscapes), and the story is pretty far fetched, like a western (not criticizing--I like westerns). Yea there is also a half-baked romance that drives the plot along, but it is totally unbelievable so I wouldn't call it a romance. But nevertheless, I found this movie enjoyable. You will also enjoy this movie if you have studied the Civil War. I kept on picking up on things and saying ""oh yea, I learned that"". The movie could have been called '101 reasons why the South lost the Civil War'. But anyways, this is no epic. It is a western.",Cold Mountain
444,j379995137999512,reflection,8,13 June 2007,"In my opinion, this is a very touching story. Inman's life was full of frustrations after he met Ada. Many people sacrificed themselves to save more people. And in the story end, Inman departed from the world forever. Just because want to save Ada, his lover. Does everybody can sacrifice for their lovers? Maybe some of the people will just say""Of course!"", but when they are in danger, they'll first run away! Also, some will say""Let me think about this question!"" They are not very sure about it. However, Inman does. He can put his lovers and his life in the same place.This is a very precious sentiment. P.S. I like Nicole Kidman a lot. She's very beautiful and graceful.",Cold Mountain
445,hummer2192,No chemistry whatsoever...,4,25 December 2003,"It is most sad that there has been such a slew of bad Civil War movies in theaters of late. That said, you have an idea of how the rest of this review shall go. Cold Mountain concentrates on one thing, how war tears families apart. This it does very well, again, and again, and again. In fact there are so many examples, one wonders how they had any time for plot. This proves to be true as Anthony Minghella spends most of his time showcasing how pitiful Kidman is, how mopey Jude Law is, and how whiny Zellweger is. All three of these characters have no chemistry with eachother, especially Law and Kidman. The entire movie subsists of them pining for eachother, yet they had little, if nothing together to begin with. Now one might say that there is a much deeper meaning in this relationship, which i do acknowledge. These poor fools are cast into a conflict which they do not wish to be a part of, and they are trying to hang on to whatever is fimiliar to them. This is where it all ends however, as Law marches on home like a mindless fool and Kidman begins to move on with her life. The story as a whole sounds like the screenplay was derived using a cookbook strategy, requiring shoot outs, explosions, and a fat naked woman to keep the interest of the audience. Minghella also threw in a sex scene towards the end of the movie in a manner which lead me to believe that he almost forgot he needed one, and threw it in. Historically, there were a few inacurracies as well. Through much of the movie, Jude Law carries with him a Le Mat pistol, an item which would cost the average soldier over a month's pay. Overall, I believe that Cold Mountain should remain what it once was, a book. Simular to Hemmingway's ""A Farewell to Arms"" the book is ripe with symbolism that High School English students would love to tear into, but as a movie the characters and events are as two dimensional as the screen on which they are projected. Please, if you are looking for a Civil War movie with profound depth and entertainment, save the nine bucks and rent Glory.",Cold Mountain

Could watch this movie over and over again. Great bonus points from my girlfriend for that. I really don't mind, though. What guy doesn't love a good war flick, right? Additionally, however, this movie gives a guy a chance to look at emotions, very raw, and not feel like he's less of man because of it. Emotions, especially in their rawest state, are what make life worth living. And this movie allows that. And you can always plead that you just enjoy the blood and guts if you want to later... Rocky, Shawshank Redemption, Unforgiven, Mystic River, Man on Fire... All of these movies do the same thing that Cold Mountain does: explore all the raw emotion in life, simplify all the complexities of life, and allow the viewer to brush it off as just enjoying a good flick.",Cold Mountain
448,TomDan,Torture. Slow Torture.,1,19 January 2004,"Another tiresome bore from Anthony Minghella, who seems to thrive on these big bloated super-productions that take over two and a half hours to do what any reasonable filmmaker would do in about ninety minutes.The story centers on Inman (a somnambulent Jude Law), who goes off to the Civil War having just barely started a sort-of romance with Nicole Kidman, a Preacher's Daughter who has recently arrived in the prettily photographed backwater town.  The story cuts back and forth between Inman's trials and tribulations at war (which is, guess what boys and girls? HELL!!) and Kidman's trials and tribulations back at home (which are, very predictably, incredibly boring).  Renee Zellwegger appears on Kidman's farm to help Kidman get it back into shape after Kidman's saintly Daddy dies of Inconvenient Character Disease.  Zellwegger acts all squinty and bossy in that Granny Clampett kind of way, dispensing enough Tough Love and Homespun Wisdom to turn the stomach of even the hardiest watcher of Touched By An Angel.This film is, quite simply, excruciating.  Avoid it like the big bloated Oscar-bait Bogus Pretentious Literary Adaptation nonsense that it is.",Cold Mountain

The acting performance of Renée Zellweger is phenomenal and she steals the show in every scene. The scenery shoots of North Carolina are sumptuous are punctuate the storyline. There are elements this movie that may dishearten some viewers, this film has a narrative and it tells it unapologetically and unreservedly. If you can get on board with a brutal and romantic war movie that focuses on those relatives of soldiers, unwilling, separated and lonely. Jack White gives a wonderful musical cameo. Highly recommended!",Cold Mountain
452,Wynner24,Could have been better,6,1 January 2004,"I had mixed feelings going into this film as the trailer was promising but it also appeared to be a film obviously gearing itself towards the Oscar race. The film itself is well shot and has some beautiful cinematography but it is the film's story that causes it to not live up to the hype. For whatever reason I found that I did not care about Nicole Kidman's side of the story nor did I care about the love story. To have a gripping love story when the main characters are not in the same scenes is hard, but not impossible, to do, and they fail here. Jude Law's side of the story is entertaining and I would argue a great 2 hour movie could have been made just with Law's story including a lot more of Phillip Seymour Hoffman's entertaining character. But instead we get a drawn out film that shows some great promise(the Civil War scene, the various character's Jude Law meets)mixed with a lot of unnecessary scenes and a story that fails to engage the viewer beyond it's surface. Overall I feel disappointed not because it was bad but because of what it could have been.",Cold Mountain
453,Nic_JudeROX,"Much better than I expected.. I mean, WOW",10,4 January 2004,"Cold Mountain was such a great movie! In fact, it's my favorite movie of the year, maybe even my favorite movie of all time. It was almost perfect, with the great directing and amazing performances. Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zelwegger make a magnificent team. They did such a great job that affected the movie in a good way.I don't know why people were saying that Law and Kidman lacked chemistry in the movie. I thought they had a perfectly good chemistry in the movie that made it even better. Jude Law really surprised me on this one. I never knew he had the talent to pull this off. I thought he was perfectly cast. I can't imagine Tom Cruise (who was supposed to play Inman) to play this role. Jude deserves an Oscar nomination for this performance of a lifetime.Nicole Kidman, on the other hand, was also good, although I liked her better in Moulin Rouge and The Hours. She delivered a great performance, as usual, but  she kinda messed up on her southern accent. Renee Zelwegger HAS to win the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for this movie. She just HAS to. She was perfect as Ruby Thewes. Natalie Portman, in my opinion, delivered her best performance so far in her career. You can actually feel her pain and her love for her husband, who died in the war, and her baby (who was, by the way, HUGE!). I think that Jude Law, Nicole Kidman, and Renee Zelwegger all deserve Oscar nominations, and hopefully wins.Ok, about the love scene. It was... um.. weird and confusing. It's not like any love scenes you see in other movies. It was confusing too because one moment they're standing up and Nicole is naked, next they're lying down and Nicole isn't naked. Then they're standing again and she's naked, then they're lying and she's not naked. blah blah blah. I dunno about the love scene. I thought that it was uneccessary to show Nicole's butt twice. I didn't see the reason or the point of showing it.Anyway, I liked this movie because you can relate to Inman as he travels home to Ada. You can tell that he's really, really, really, really, really in love with Ada, and vice versa. It was amazing how they didn't lose hope and how they remained faithful to each other even though they only shared three or four moments at the beginning. And that kiss. That kiss looked... WOW. I'd kiss Jude in a heartbeat. It was that kiss that helped him survive through the war, and with the help of Ada's picture.This movie deserves all eight nominations it got for the Golden Globes. I'm rooting for this movie to win the Best Picture award for the Globes AND the Oscars.I give this movie two thumbs up! ***** out of *****! 10 out of 10! A+",Cold Mountain
454,are_you_a_giraffe,"Unforgettable, unmissable, unbelievable.",10,29 February 2004,"Big, sweeping romantic epics don't come along as often as we'd like, so set a date to see this powerful love story set during America's Civil War. From the director of The English Patient, Anthony Minghella, the film focuses on what matters cinematically, such as impressive scenery and artistic, daring camera angles, as well as adapting and delving deep into the heart-warming emotions, originally displayed in Charles Frazier's acclaimed novel. The chemistry between onscreen sweethearts Nicole Kidman and Jude Law is explosively romantic, while Renée Zellweger injects some well-timed humour in amongst the thrills, spills and heartache that wartime love can bring.Although a sombre movie, with numerous explosive scenes full of the best special effects around, cinematically, Cold Mountain is given an authentic look- largely due to the exquisite costumes displayed on screen, exquisitely hand-crafted, and are appropriately suited for the backdrops around them.
The actors in the film, all make admirable attempts at capturing the Southern accent. Although their accents are flimsy and inconsistent at times, the variations in speech could be put down to Minghella's creativity and authenticity, and relate to the different cultures and backgrounds at the time.Overall, a terrific romance/war epic, with sensational technical work, horrifically spectacular action, rich characters and a love story to die for.A MUST SEE FOR 2004!",Cold Mountain
455,romanthompsonthompson28,"Civil War Epic, good, maybe even really good, but not great",7,29 January 2011,"It seems this is a controversial movie. Reviewers are equally divided in pros & cons. In my opinion this is not an outstanding film, but it has some good features to point out. First of all the marvelous photography done by John Seale (he is also responsible for ""Gorillas in the Mist""). Snow covered woods; rural trails and mountainous landscape are shown with masterful skill. The music is another high point, T-Bone Burnett is the executive producer and three of his songs are scored here. Nicole Kidman in the role of Ada Monroe and Jude Law as Inman performs correctly and convincingly. Renée Zellweger as Ruby Thewes a rural girl is really the best of the cast. Outwardly hardboiled and outspoken, she let the viewer get in touch with her inner tenderness and humanity thru her shinning eyes and glances. The director, Anthony Minghella, is not one of my favs, but this is by far, much better than his well known ""The English Patient"".The story is situated in the Civil War times. Inman goes to war, as thousands of others, only to find out that war is cruel and senseless for the ordinary soldiers. After long years of service he is wounded one more time and decides to quit. To go home, to return to his true love, to where he belongs. This is a forbidden issue for any soldier in any war. So his long pilgrimage is full of obstacles and dangers. In Cold Mountain, Ada awaits the end of the war and the return of her lover. She faces many hardships with the only help of Ruby. Will they reunite? You must see the film in order to discover it. A final caution: there are some nude scenes, well acted and filmed but may be inconvenient for young audiences.",Cold Mountain
456,gcutforth,Captures the spirit of the novel superbly,10,26 December 2003,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS**** Cold Mountain is a beautifully written novel, one that captures the anguish and heartbreak of a time when families could not look to the future with any certainty. The story of Ada and Inman took me to places I had never been before and moved me to emotions that were felt deeply. The ending is filled with irony and heartbreak and yet it is also filled with hope. I knew Cold Mountain would make a great movie.Thus, when I heard that Anthony Minghella would be making the movie I was sure he would do it justice. However, I was quite surprised and leery of the casting of Nicole Kidman and Jude Law ... not quite how I pictured Ada and Inman. Not to worry. They are both excellent and now I can't imagine anyone else in either role. Renée Zellweger was definitely not how I pictured Ruby, but she is also marvelous.As I watched the movie, many of the feelings and emotions from reading the book welled up inside me as scenes that had been only moving pictures in my mind played across the screen in front of me. I wasn't expecting this until the end, but for me it is a sure sign the cast and direction and music and writing had all superbly combined to add even more pleasure to my enjoyment of the book. As with Mystic River, having read the novel was perhaps an advantage that enhanced the movie experience. Even though I knew how everything would play out, knowing the background behind each scene allowed me to add in my mind what the movie was unable to present. Both Eastwood and Minghella were able to strip the story down to the necessary parts that moved the story forward without losing any of the emotion and complications.I am looking forward to seeing Cold Mountain many times again once it is released on video. It is one of the great Civil War movies, along with the Shenandoah, the wonderful James Stewart movie from 1965, that really captures the heartbreak of how the war disrupted the lives of ordinary citizens.Those who loved the book shouldn't be disappointed. Cold Mountain will take it's place as one of my all time favorite Romances, along with Casablanca, The English Patient, The Princess Bride and The Way We Were.",Cold Mountain
457,aaronsaft,Why I thought Cold Mountain was just plain bad.,1,16 January 2004,"I could forgive the fact that the movie was shot in Romania (the time and place are a crucial part of the novel full of character and qualified film staff, but remained an untapped resource for the movie).  I could forgive that foreign actors were used as leads, presumably for their names, while there are perfectly qualified American, or better yet southern actors available (there was an Australian, an Englishman, a couple Irishmen, and a whole bunch of Romanians; Oh and one great young southern actor, Ethan Suplee with a relatively inconsequential part.).  I could forgive the geographical mistakes (if you are in Petersburg, VA start walking south or west or better yet uphill and you will get to Avery County, NC, but you will never see the ocean).  I could forgive the lack of true development of a villain or evil (several were suggested, the weakest of which was there for the finale).  I could forgive Phillip Seymore Hoffman's British southern fusion accent (Not nearly as bad as Nichole Kidman's or Jude Law's sad attempts at southerners...sad and inconsistent), or Rene Zellweger's comic book interpretation of her comic relief character (she was occasionally amusing after all).  I could forgive the soundtrack for leading me by the nose though every pivotal scene like some kind of emotional laugh track (not the bluegrass, the bluegrass was great).  I could forgive Natalie Portman for anything (because she is supremely attractive).  I could forgive a lot of things, but I'm not gonna.  It was just bad.  The acting. The interpretation of the story.  Character development.  The sexual tension. The release of said tension.  This is Hollywood hubris at it's best.  To be fair everyone worked very hard, and with a different script and a different director this cast could have made one of the greatest movies ever (I have a deep respect for so many actors involved in this movie), and Cold Mountain is a nice vehicle (most of the nice parts of the movie were where Minghella left the book alone), but it just didn't happen.  Donald Sutherland was very good along with James Gammon and Giovanni Ribisi.  Romania was pretty. Cold Mountain however, was just plain bad.",Cold Mountain

Jude Law and especially Nicole Kidman, whose last year's performance in The Hours shocked me with her undertone of power. And with a cast of amazing supporting actors, including the likes of Phillip Seymor Hoffman and Giovanni Rabissi. How could anyone not love this movie? Simple, it was sold to you. You were not expected to buy it or believe. It was a bad soap opera on wheels rolling into a ravine. True, this movie had its moments. But that is all it had moments of average filming that swept you away for a second. Yet, you were brought back quickly by the stereotypes of the film.

The film then centers around Inman fighting for, and then deserting the South in the civil war.I loved this movie, and I hate how everyone's been calling it 'mindless action'. It's not mindless, it's actually very dramatic. The acting is great from pretty much all accounts, even Jack White does a good job.Inman captures the 'love-torn soldier' role, and Kidman does well as his lover.

Nicole Kidman looked too beautiful throughout the movie (even in scenes where she is suppose to be ragged working the fields and going through extreme hardships). I always thought she was attractive but never looked so good as in this movie. It was the only unrealistic thing, almost a distraction (fault of Mingella).

The camera, as it remains fixed on Inman's face, after the desperate widow shoots the soldier whom we know is innocent, one feels the despair in his washed out expression; that he has nothing to hold onto, except to move on, since there are those few precious moments in memory that demand a final word. There is the old woman who soothes Inman's wounds, also soothing his soul; his love pours out in words. There is Ada digging the soil; her awkwardness in life striking her, maddening and incapacitating her; she still exercises the art of eloquent speech, when she needs desperately to learn to work her fragile body. There is Ada's photo, being charred in the remains of the fire, when Inman, in his zombie-like resurrection, saves it from ceasing to exist, or maybe he doesn't and I am imagining this (remembering a film is always an act of imagination) There is the parade of the American flag, as it sweeps across a land exploded into a dark, saturated, reddish glow. What must that photo, and those few letters from Ada have meant for him, during the time of death, when they are always at the brink of being lost, being left behind. There is also forgetfulness, in the cheery obscene dinner table where caresses are swapped beneath the table, along with vulgar proposals, when raw, immediate desire threatens the abstract, precious memory.There is the promise of the green forest, when it stretches, from a bird's view,immeasurable distances and also its deceit, when it proves itself inhospitable for refuge.

Regardless of what those idiots think: the purpose of a movie is to entertain its viewer no punish him for being dumb enough to buy a ticket.Because of this movie, I have dubbed its makers a pox upon humanity.  I haven't got the grapes to do it, myself, but if you erase all traces of their existence from history I will tip my hat to you.  Don't watch this movie.  It is an agonizing waste of life.  I'm not much of a reader, but I would say that, in this case, you would be better off reading a cheap supermarket romance novel or beating yourself to death with a sack full of doorknobs.",Cold Mountain

Both Nicole, and Renee deserve awards along with Jade for excellent performances.  The depth of the movie was breathtaking.

478,skilesj8020,The Gone With the Wind of 21st Century!!!!,10,10 January 2004,This is a tremendous film and definitely the best of the year. I would rate this film as the Gone With the Wind of the 21st Century. The name of Nicole Kidman speaks for itself but Cold Mountain should give Jude Law the recognition he has long deserved. Tremendous cinematography and superb acting will definitely make this film a classic of the future. The Academy has definitely missed it if this film does not walk away a big winner at the Awards ceremony. Best Film! Best Actress! Best Actor! Best Supporting Actress!!!

I was genuinely surprised at how much I loved it--I don't remember the last time I shed a tear over a movie. I sobbed during this. After leaving the theater with friends, we were nearly uncontrollable in our emotions. This movie leaves a lasting impression. It was the first thing I thought of when I woke up. I just can't get it out of my head. You feel like you were there, like you personally knew the characters; it makes you want to cling tightly to everyone you love. It makes you appreciate life. I LOVED this film. I think this is a must-see. I know it was based on a book. I have not read the book, but this movie definitely stands on its own.",Cold Mountain

Here you have a movie where 4mm men went off to war, leaving all the women behind. Good idea.  Not only show a cival war period movie but show what went on behind the curtain as well. Ada and Ruby did not have time to feel sorry for themselves-they had to invent their own survival.I gave it an 8 based upon an average of 10 for Ada & Ruby, and 6 for Inman and the rest of the men.

482,phf_uk,Cold Mountain - A Review,8,23 January 2004,"Ada and Inman love each other. But like most young people, they take life and time for granted and leave things unsaid. Only when Inman is called to fight for the South in the American Civil War do they realize the magnitude of their loss. Separated and constantly assailed by the horrors of war, death of loved ones and the cruelty of weak men, they hold on to the hope of finding each other to keep them alive.
Director Anthony Minghella creates truly memorable images that are certain to linger on in the viewer's memory. The scenes where Ada and Inman interact are carefully played down and manage to maintain a clear originality. The superb visual style of the film owes much to the excellent work of cinematographer John Seale, who worked with Minghella in 'The English Patient' and in 'The Talented Mr. Ripley'.
Jude Law does a good job of portraying Inman, a man of few words, and the scriptwriters made sure his lines are well worth the utter. Equally impressive is Nicole Kidman, whose character (Ada) undergoes a complete transformation from a shy, spoiled girl to a brave and resilient woman. But Renee Zellweger is the one who steals the show as the laborer Ruby - in fact, she's so good you almost forget her character is rather two-dimensional.
All in all, Cold Mountain is a very satisfying cinematic experience that works on all levels - good acting, well-structured screenplay, assured direction, beautiful soundtrack and superb cinematography. And unlike most long films, it keeps a fast pace right to the very end. A realistic, sometimes brutal, love story, Cold Mountain is a true work of art.",Cold Mountain

Nicole Kidman's accent was kinda weak, but believable. Renee Zellweger was amazing in all aspects. Jude Law had the best accent and did an incredible job. That and he is really, really hot. I don't think the violence is over done at all. I mean it's really not that graphic and there's not that much of it. The sexuality really seems to be a big issue. If you are a mature person than you won't have a problem with it. It's not that bad and it is completely necessary to the story. Anyways go see it. It's worth your time and money.

True, the actors did a great job with what they were given, but the story line was weak and was fleshed out by violence and very explicit sex. Do not take children to see this movie or you may be answering more questions than you are ready to. Being a civil-war era buff, I was very disappointed in this movie.  It had so much potential and was sensationalized just to get the rating of R (and in some cases could have been X).",Cold Mountain

Young man meets a girl, falls in love, goes to war, gets hurt, can't get back to her, finally goes AWOL, nearly dies in returning, saves her from bad guys, then dies in a gun duel.Some of the premises were less than convincing. I think the cinematography was pretty good, but it was hard to notice while sleeping.Basically a Romance Novel on speed... guys, don't be fooled by the scary commercials and hints at war. A few explosions and disappointing gun fights make this movie out to be one big disappointment. ~Jason",Cold Mountain
487,Valezza,A very atmospheric movie,10,17 October 2004,"(small spoilers)The author of ""English patient"" hardly could shoot a film somehow in other way - a very dramatic story about parting against a background of breaking down the foundations of society in Anthony Minghella's style could look exactly like this. The main hero of the picture hides from battue against deserters and makes his way home, the main heroine beats off all the nature assaults and those who wants encroach on her, on her home, but love being borne after a few short dates overcomes all tests.This director's sending worked greatly - those who wanted to see in ""Cold Mountain"" the rough narration about faith and courage in hard times, will get enough of this. Nevertheless, the rest of the people can find it not such a great - here and there the author goes too far, and constant changes of rhythm get the audience out of their groove. In some scenes, the film amazes with its style and exility, but in the others it bores hell a lot! But it is normal with Minghella - either you accept his conditions or go pass over it.Judging by that the budget was repaid already in American box-office, Minghella's vision of shooting the historical film has got the whole crowds of admirers.4/5",Cold Mountain
488,hbomb7,"Human characters, Zelwegger's accent",10,18 May 2004,"This contains a few spoilers of relatively minor plot points. The thing that struck me most about this remarkable film was its intense humanity. It's been several months since I've seen it, but I recall vividly the power of being sucked into these characters' physical and emotional hardships. It was the kind of power that had me asking myself ""could I love that strongly, or obsessively?"" ""Would I be able to stand battle that ferocious?"" I could lie with Natalie Portman's Sarah and feel her anguish and loneliness. I could kneel in the dirt with Nicole Kidman's Ada and feel her helplessness. I could imagine the terror with Sally Swanger as her sons and husband were murdered before her eyes. In short, the actors were so adept at portraying the characters that I could imagine being any one of them, which made the film highly affective, indeed.By the way, one other commenter said that Renee Zelwegger is a Brit and, considering this, did a fine job with her accent. Actually, she is from Texas and I was happy that she had a chance to return to her southern roots (although the accent was greatly exaggerated for her character Ruby) after portraying the British Bridget Jones a couple times.",Cold Mountain
489,jelleybeans,Stunning film!,10,27 June 2004,"This movie is set for release to DVD/VHS on Tuesday, June 29th. I work for a major chain video store and I'm able to view movies prior to release in order to make recommendations to customers. I missed this in the theaters but just finished watching it on DVD a second time!I watched it TWICE in two days because I wanted to catch what I may have missed the first time. The scenery is gorgeous, the major battle scene is epic and despite what an earlier comment states, the love story is totally believable. Yes, the two principals, Ada (Nicole Kidman) and Inman (Jude Law) only share a few words and glances but the spark is ignited before Inman marches off to war with the rest of the able-bodied young men of Cold Mountain. The thought of the possibilities of that love is what carries Ada and Inman through the most difficult times in their separate lives. It's a dream, a hope that some day things will be better if they are ever reunited and that together, there is a future even though the war and the resultant circumstances have changed them both forever.Ada writes to Inman constantly although he actually only receives three of her letters but they are most precious to him and he reads and re-reads them every chance he gets to help keep him sane in insane times. He never writes her back although he composes his own letters in his head (heard in voice-overs) because he feels that the war has changed him too much and he is not the same as when he left her. He is injured and recuperating in a hospital when he is outside one day to enjoy the sun and he decides to go back to her (one of her letters pleads with him to stop whatever he is doing and just ""Come back to me. Come back to me."") He simply starts walking even though soldiers are warned to stay on the hospital grounds. Inman's adventures as he makes his way back to Ada and Cold Mountain are strongly reminiscent of Homer's ""Odyssey"", complete with a long time away from home due to a war hundreds of miles from home, suitors angling for Ada/Penelope's hand and land, Sirens and a person who takes care of Inman/Odysseus in a hut in the wilderness.A separate disc is PACKED with Special Features that only added to my enjoyment of the DVD, including a segment/special called ""The Words and Music of Cold Mountain"". In this special, director Anthony Minghella is interviewed about the process of bring the movie to life, Sting reads part of a chapter of the book (yes, it was a BOOK before it was a movie) and Jack White (who plays ""Georgia"" in the film) performs some of the lonesome bluegrass music heard in the film.The acting is superb; Renee Zellweger more than deserves her Supporting Actress Golden Globe and Oscar and it's too bad Nicole Kidman while nominated for a Golden Globe was overlooked at the Oscars. (Charlize Theron won both for ""Monster"".) Jude Law is excellent, too. I much preferred his performance over Sean Penn in ""Mystic River"" (Oscar) and Bill Murray in ""Lost in Translation"" (Golden Globe).All told a great movie. I highly recommend it.",Cold Mountain

Yes, ""Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" was a wonderful movie, ""Cold Mountain"" was everything I want to see in a movie. It had a beautiful romance that came at the very beginning of the Civil War. The most romantic part of the movie is that they fight to hang onto, some hope that the other is not dead or wed another.""Cold Mountain"" shows what war will do to people. There are scenes in the movie that will make you laugh, cry and even realize that even in the darkest of ages, even in the most desolate of times there is some hope that people can hold onto. For those people who have read the book it maintains the true essence of Charles Frazier's masterpiece. It shows the beauty of the South and the terrifying events that changed America forever. Inman's struggle is a version of the ""Odyssey"". Inman's eternal struggle will make you reach for your tissues. When he tells yells ""I'm done, I am done fighting."" It makes you fall in love with him ten times over. He has struggled to leave the war, but it seems that the war is only at his doorstep. Thank you Anthony Minghella for making movies such as this. Thank you for maintaining the classical way of film making. Cold Mountain gets a 10.",Cold Mountain

492,gwr50,Opportunity Missed,3,6 July 2004,"If you saw and liked Doris Day as Calamity Jane, -- in a past decade, then you will love Renee Zellweger as Ruby. When you first meet her, you will smile. A little further into the movie she will make you laugh, and before its over she will make you want to cry. A truly great performance, and a marvelous character.I thought Nichole Kidman also had an excellent performance as Ada. Unfortunately for her, many of her scenes were shot with Zellweger's Ruby causing her to be upstaged. Overall, I found the movie disappointing. If one thought they were going to see a civil war movie, they didn't. If they thought they were going to see a love story, they didn't. Instead you got to witness the journey of an unworthy and somewhat despicable character who evaded and escaped from characters even more despicable then he, for the purpose of reuniting with, not a lover, but a mere acquaintance.The performance of Jude Law was without any passion. He didn't show fear when he should have been scared to death. He didn't display anger when he should have been mad as hell, and regardless how perilous his plight, he never showed despair.Whether the responsibility is that of the director, the content of the book or even the quality of the screen play, I do not know, but the opportunity to make a very good or even great movie was missed.Perhaps they should have considered new patches on old jeans. Sommersby, with Richard Gere comes to mind.",Cold Mountain

In particular, I thought the director and Jude and Nicole did an amazing job with the kiss between Inman and Ada just before Inman left. It was the most romantic kiss I've ever seen in a film. I thought it was crucial for setting the tone for the rest of the movie; it managed to make it believable that Inman and Ada would walk/wait, respectively, for each other for all that time without ever really having had a relationship. I thought the film managed this crucial plot point much better than the book itself. I'm sure many of you will be quick to name other film kisses which best this one, but this one is it for me!

Just seemed like the directors way to making the movie better. You can only shine a turd so much.Overall I though the movie was disturbing. I know a lot of how the movie was put together was based on 'how it was then' but some things you don't need to see. The old lady petting her goat talking about how much she loves it, then slicing it's throat was unnecessary. The child watching his Mom shake her naked ass in font Inman while bent over a table was unnecessary.

Despite Ms. Kidman's performance, the movie and the rest of the actors were wonderful. I would definitely watch this movie again. This movie is more of a romance mixed in with occasional action. The one really bad part of the movie is that the role of the bad guys is deeply overplayed and too predictable. The movie would have been better if these bad guys made hardly any appearances until the end. I don't know if the position of these bad guys is historically accurate, but it did not seem very believable.",Cold Mountain

501,armintamzarian-1,"""Cold Mountain"" - A Technical Review",10,24 January 2005,"Adapted from the Charles Frazier novel, and a poignant study of love prevailing over distance, time, and war, Cold Mountain (2003 Miramax Films) tears a romance asunder by means of the Civil War.Reverend Monroe (Donald Sutherland) and his beautiful and loving daughter Ada (Nicole Kidman) move from Charlotte to the community of Cold Mountain, North Carolina just before the War Between the States. Ada subsequently meets and falls in love with Inman (Jude Law), a local laborer and soon-to-be Confederate soldier. Inman is sent to the front lines as his relationship with Ada is only beginning, and, soon after their relocation, Reverend Monroe passes away, leaving Ada to care for herself. Much to the dismay of her neighbors, Ada is unable to take care of both herself and the Monroe's property. When it seems as if the situation could not worsen, Ruby Thewes (Renée Zellweger) arrives and restores the Monroe estate and Ada. Inman meanwhile escapes from a military hospital, deserting his country and its cause, to return to Ada, to whom he has been writing and from whom he has been receiving letters. The movie relates Inman's journey home and also chronicles the difficulties that both Ada and Cold Mountain experience in the absence of all of its able-bodied men.Virtually every aspect of Cold Mountain is effective in contributing to the movie's success as a whole. Casting is excellent. Each actor fits his or her role quite well  there are very few times in the movie that the audience is reminded that this is a production by professional storytellers. Scenery is unquestionably one of Cold Mountain's fortes; sweeping panoramic shots of picturesque landscapes characterize the movie's cinematographic establishment of setting. Along the same lines, the movie's setting (both time and location) compliments the central theme of romance exceptionally. Cold Mountain's use of Civil War-era Appalachia for a backdrop plays on the nostalgia of the audience perfectly. The tempo of the movie is another of its strengths. At no point is the viewer bored  constant plot twists abound and new characters appear often, yet the observer commands a comprehensive understanding of the tale at all times. To top it off, Cold Mountain successfully utilizes an oft-ignored component of cinema: music. The musical score does its job modestly, enhancing the different elements of the film, but it rises to the task when called upon.First-rate casting, outstanding cinematic work, and a plot that is both captivating and moving provide for an extraordinary movie. Cold Mountain relates a saga of romance and undying love while exploiting the historic sentiments of its viewers.",Cold Mountain

The film has an air of slumming stars playacting backwoods characters: they got them south'n accints down real gud, paw. Superstars should simply stay away from playing regional characters unless they go all the way, like Charlize Theron in Monster.

When the film first came out, I wasn't at all tempted to view the movie. It appeared to be dull and depressing. I happened to receive the novel as a gift, and recently finished reading it. I was absolutely enchanted with the book. I've never really been impressed with movie adaptations of books. This novel was so brilliant, I felt an urge to see the visual adaptation. My oh my, I'm glad I've seen it! The acting was absolutely superb. The whole cast gave believable performances that totally envelopes you with emotion. My favorite character was Inman. He didn't say much, but his body language and facial expressions spoke a thousand words. I also think the chemistry between him and Ada closely represented what was written in the book. They only kissed once before Inman went to war, so some may think it's unreasonable for them to cling to their love through three or four years of separation. We're talking about the 1860's people...sex before marriage was uncalled for. A kiss meant so much more than it does nowadays! The cinematography was stunning. Who knew that Romania was so beautiful? According to the director's commentary, scenes jump from S. Carolina, to Virgina, and then to Romainia. The transitions were seamless, and you had no idea the filming was done on two different continents. You could also understand why Inman was so drawn to Cold Mountain. Not only was it Ada, but the locale was mesmerizing. The music was entertaining and poignant. Stobrod's fiddle changed his life forever, which in turn brought him together with his daughter he neglected for so many years. The music not only affected the characters emotionally, but the viewer as well.What more can I say? I am absolutely shocked. I had no idea I'd be so in love with this film.

506,cjmxv3,Alright movie,6,1 June 2005,"The movie had a pretty good story, but overall I didn't think it was a great movie. Overall I just think it went on too long. I don't really understand why they did the ""three years earlier"" thing, it wasn't really necessary I didn't think.The end of the film was surprisingly anticlimactic and dragged on further then it had to. I was under the impression that the whole movie was about these two people in love with each other and trying to find each other again. So he finally finds her and...well the next scene is Ada and Ruby are having some off topic conversation. Maybe its just me, but I was a little disappointed when, after three years of searching, they didn't simply find each other, put something good in, and end the movie. They finally made love about 10 minutes (film time) after meeting for the first time in three years, but by then it was already ruined.Then I thought that parts of the story were pretty phony. I know it's a movie and its not supposed to be 100% realistic, but after he stumbles upon the third random woman in the middle of nowhere who happens to openly offer him food and shelter (which was limited to them as well), it got kind of fake. Then, Ruby's father is shot and laying in the snow overnight but Ruby and Ada somehow revive him in a little wooden shack on the mountain? My whole party believed he was dead after getting shot, kind of fake there as well.The last little quirk for me was that some of the dialog seemed really bad. Like lines from a Schwartzeneger movie or something. Like when the old hag kills the donkey (I hate her for that), the little monologue she says before that, come on. Nobody would do that. For a movie that was supposed to be so serious, the one liners in the battle scenes were pretty dull as well.Don't get me wrong, it wasn't a bad movie, but it just wasn't a great movie. I thought it had a good story from about 15 minutes in to about 15 minutes before it ended. The acting was pretty good, I don't know what the deal was with the Boy Meets World guy, but even he wasn't bad.Overall, this is definitely a movie for the women. I can see how a woman would like this more then a man. You can't be picky when you watch it, and you have to be really ready to watch it, because it moves at a SNAILS PACE.

Simply put the film is about a Civil War deserter trying to get home to the love of his life.Unfortunately, Inman is just a little too humble to be the main character of a romance film such as this one and it is beyond insane that he is driven by his love for Ada even though the two had barely known each other and only crossed each other's paths a handful of times. As a result it is hard to really care if the two end up together or not because the fact that two people could be so blinded by this sham that they call love is nauseating. Overall, the film does an outstanding job recreating the Civil War setting in the south and there are a few watchable scenes, but the boring Civil War deserter Inman and the unlikable Ada eventually put the viewer to sleep.",Cold Mountain
508,lethaloption,Lack of relationship building early in film.,8,17 July 2005,"One of the most notable criticisms is the lack of relationship building between Inman and Ada in the beginning of the film. Having not read the novel, is there a deeper explanation? I do believe that in the 1860's relationship development was much shallower than what we perceive to be necessary today (depending on how you look at it). In the film the characters seem like genuine good people. The interaction between these two early in the film certainly doesn't warrant almost getting yourself killed everyday to 'get back to her.' Maybe it's that 'in love' vibe that people get when they first flip out over someone - and it just never wore off? That seemed like the only thing that didn't make much sense about the story line.",Cold Mountain
509,jrbreeze-92686,AP US History Movie Review,7,22 December 2015,"After doing some research on this movie, I found that it was a decently accurate movie, but there were times when what was shown wasn't what actually happened. The first scene is the battle at Petersburg, which was very accurate, except that when it actually happened, there were both African-American troops and white troops, since they were separate at the time, and in the movie there were only white troops present. The details in the scene were very accurate, though, like that the place the Confederates were was blown up and because of how it was done, many were trapped, and then the Union army was able to move in and attack those that were still there. On the accuracy of how the women are shown, I have found that overall it was very accurate to the time. Often, people believe that everyone who lived in the South during the Civil War was a supporter of the war, but women usually weren't, just as they weren't in the movie. Also, since the characters lived in a rural town, the women weren't always supervised like they would have been in a place that was more populated. In the film, the two main characters that were women were often together, but not usually with anyone else. I personally thought the movie was okay. I didn't think that it would be as violent as it was, but it wasn't too bad. I enjoyed the love story part of it, too.",Cold Mountain

Witnessing war's atrocities, Inman begins a trek across the war-torn South to return to Ada.",8,3 January 2016,"This movie expertly illustrates a different point of view than most are likely used to. Politics are largely neglected in this film, as opposed to the exclusively political conflicts depicted in Lincoln and other such films documenting the Civil War Era. Instead,the struggles and tribulations of an average confederate soldier brings the atrocities of the war, and its impact on the entire south into context for viewers. Viewers are able to, in a very emotional way, experience the horror of battle, as well as the effect on all walks of life in the south. The film details several battles between the Union and Confederate forces, all of which are barbaric bloody brawls. It brings to light the desperation of the soldiers to survive, as well as the near-fervor for their own cause. The way in which southern soldiers were shown to fight reflects the honor and the warrior mentality that the south had at the time, which bolstered its efforts against the Union. Historical accuracy seems rather evident. Conflict existed all across the South during this time period, and it seems accurate that there would be Union Soldiers desperate enough to raid entire towns, steal livestock and supplies, and terrorize locals, seeking food. A mother is encountered by Inman, who misses her husband enough that she would lie with him to recall her husband's presence. It is safe to assume that the husband was also drawn away by the war. The conflict affects every person in the country, and this film makes the situation heartfelt, and as evidently volatile and conflict-ridden as it must have been to actually experience it. The choice to steer clear of political dealings, and focus solely on the domestic effects and tolls that the war took, serves this film well, and it engages viewers, as well as drawing them into the time period. One can truly learn about the war, as well as the time period from watching this film.",Cold Mountain
511,erikahermanson,Summary of movie and review,8,3 January 2016,"The movie was a romantic film that captured a love story as two people split up because of the Civil War. The movie shows both the relaxing parts of the war, the intense battle fields, the families struggling at home, and women's roles during the Civil War. In the beginning of the movie Inman the soldier who will soon go off to war and Ada, the daughter of a Charleston preacher man who has recently moved to Cold Mountain meet and instantly have a connection. The film then follows Inman as he struggles the difficulties of war so that he can return home to Ada, and Ada as she struggles to maintain the life she once knew after her father passes identifies key points of the Civil War. The movie shows gruesome scenes that show how the war ended up affecting many people's lives. The movie details how soldiers treated women and families and indicates the death and rape of many of the women and children. The movie also captures the age differences in the war and showed that many young men were off to fight the war. During the movie Inman and a few other men are captured and this shows that different soldiers would do anything they needed to try and win the war. Overall, the movie captured different aspects of the war pretty well. Although some of the terms or ideas used in the movie had not yet been used during the time period, the movie did a good job showcasing the important details and ideas of the Civil War that are educational and important for the audience to know. While detailing the Civil War the movie also described a love story that captured the audience and made them want to watch until the end.",Cold Mountain
512,TheSundancekid0,beautifully haunting,10,16 November 2005,"I love this movie, I think it's beautiful and the fact that Anthony Minghella is a genius and should be treated as such. The fact that this man treats the eerie and beautiful music as another actor that he cast in this film says a lot about the man. You know, there was a time in which this did happen ladies and gents, I've talked to my great grandma and she's told me plenty about her grandpa's adventures during the civil war. Whether we like it or not, our amazing country once decided to separate and fight one another. If that doesn't amaze you, then don't watch this movie. The story is as rich as the country itself, it lingers within my heart.Anyone reading this needs to realize that in our generation, all links to the civil war will be gone, and with this the understanding of such an event will be gone too. We're losing what once made us what we are today. I love this movie; listen, love and learn about our families history. thanks :)",Cold Mountain
513,br-70517,Southern Homefront Lifestyle,7,2 January 2017,"Minghella's Cold Mountain is a love story gone wrong. The story was mostly accurate depicting of the impact of the Civil war on the Southerners. The story was written by Charles Frazier- whose great great grandfather, W.P. Inman, fought for the Confederacy during the Civil War. During the war, Inman was wounded and brought to a hospital. After he healed, he escaped the prison hospital in Virginia in hopes to return home to Cold Mountain, North Carolina, to reunite with his love. Frazier did not know all the details about his grandfather's journey, but through research, he wrote what he believed Inman's journey would entail as he traveled home. Prior to the war, Ada, one of the main character, has recently moved to Cold Mountain with her father. She doesn't have any friends besides her father, but she briefly meets Inman and they fall in love. However, shortly after Ada's arrival, many men including Inman are overcome with nationalism and join to fight the war. Ada and her father continue to live on the farm until the father dies unexpectedly. Ada now owns his property and the farm; she frees all of her father's slaves but now is struggling to keep the farm alive. Eventually, a neighbor named Ruby comes along to help her with the farm. Ada learns new skills and the farm begins to thrive again. Ada continues to stay loyal to Inman and writes him several letters. However, as the war drags, the more Ada questions their love- after all they had only known each other for a short period of time. She prays for his survival and tries to predict the future by looking in a water well. With the help of two neighbors, she leans back with a mirror to see the water reflection in the mirror. She briefly sees a man coming closer as crows surround him and he falls to the ground. Confused about the message, Ada is unsure if the message means Inman is returning to herMeanwhile, Inman is traveling back home. Throughout his journey, he meets a variety of different people and encounters many challenges. He scavenges food and in some households he is invited for an overnight stay. At one stop in particular he meets a young woman named Sara. She became a widow when her husband joined the war and she is currently raising her young baby alone on a small farm. She lets Inman stay for the night but the presences of a man reminds of her husband and she begins to sob. Without a husband or father, Sara and her baby's life will be impacted forever. The morning after, soldiers come to her farm asking for a runaway soldier (Inman). She declines any knowledge but they search her house and torment her and her baby until Inman appears and kills the soldiers. On several occasions during his trip, Inman meets people that will delay or hurry his voyage; very similar to the epic, The Odyssey. In The Odyssey, Odysseus went far to fight in war which lasted longer than expected. He wants to return home to his wife and let her know he's alive but is faced with many challenges. Odysseus encounters a Cyclops, sea monsters and much more. Inman's story is very similar. Inman is returning home from war to reunite with his love, but his journey was not easy and very time consuming. Some people provided him with supplies, others tagged along on for the trip and others make the journey more difficult. Overall, I think that the attitude about the war is supported well by the variety of people Inman comes across. Each has their own perspective about tolls war brings and each person has a story. Like the hermit goat lady in the forest. She is very kind to Inman without knowing who he is. She heals Inman and sends him on his way with supplies. Although the war changed people, it showed there is still kindness which has been lacking for some time. The movie demonstrates the impacts of the war, not always thought about. More than slave owners were impacted by the war- families lost their males and towns were reduced to mostly women and young children.",Cold Mountain

Ada is left to manage Black Cove Farm all alone after the death of her father and she has no idea what to do. Seeing Ada so lonely, Sally Swanger sends a local girl named Ruby to help Ada out with the farm. Inman goes through a dangerous and violent journey westward but had to retrace his steps when he was handed over to the Home Guard by Junior. Inman ends up meeting a nice slave who feeds him as well as provide clothing and help him draw out a map of what lies ahead. As Inman continues to wander, he meets many other people along the way who aid him on his journey. Inman soon arrives at Black Cove Farm and finds the sight of Cold Mountain. The next day he finds Ada hunting turkeys and they spend the next few days together at the Cherokee village, discussing their feelings, past experiences, and their plans for the future. Inman decides to walk north to surrender to the Federalists because the war was going to end soon. This movie really touched my heart because Inman had to go through such tough obstacles to get back to his loved one and through this we can see what people during the Civil War had to go through. The movie really absorbs the audience into the lives of the people who were away at war and those who were left behind, trying to desperately get rid of such horrible repercussions.",Cold Mountain
515,amyla-25681,The movie deeply moved my heart,9,1 January 2017,"The movie amazingly displays the time period of the Civil War, showing the great scene of the giant explosion that started the Battle of Crater in part of Siege of Petersburg as the opening scene into the movie. Just with this horrific scene of the war, it brought me the feelings of terror and the visions of the war that I could never imagine. It got me absorbed into the movie quickly. Throughout the movie, it provided us the hardships that the main characters, as well as the people that lived through the war, had to survive in. The film not only conveyed one perspective during these terrifying times, it showed us a woman's point of view and what they had endured when the men had to live for war. Additionally, the film portrayed the scenes of the war very well with appropriate attire and choice of music. The director, Anthony Minghella gave the realities of the battles that men were forced to face, for instance, some of the Yankee soldiers were treated brutality. Nevertheless, this film is originally on two lovers (Inman and Ada) that longed for another and hoped to reunite since the Civil War brought them apart.It's a tragic story that both Ada and Inman only have memories of each other to rely on. Also, in the film there were symbols displayed to foreshadow the outcomes of the couples. It was very interesting to connect the dots and predict the outcomes, which I was not expecting. Briefly, the movie overall was excellent. Not only did it showed the battles that one could not imagine except to those who experienced war. Jude Law and Nicole Kidman both played their character very well. Law portrayed as Inman, a young man that was very considerate and shy that lived in Cold Mountain (NC) while Kidman was Ada that was forced to mature as her father died. This movie had made a great impact on me and I would highly recommend this, however, to those who are very emotional be prepare to cry.",Cold Mountain

You too will follow Inman back to his love that he longs for a few more precious moments (diamonds) with a women he hardly knows. The obstacles and challenges that he must endure. You will feel the painful separation and longing for a love that Ada felt for her Beau (Inman)....all the way to the end.

517,jessica-56155,"Cold Mountain: Beautiful cinematography, yet bleak execution.",6,1 January 2018,"Cold Mountain touches all of the social issues that occured at the end of the Civil War leading into the era of Reconstruction. Ada (Nicole Kidman) falls in love with a shy man Inman (Jude Law). Inman gets sent off into the war, as a Confederate soldier, where the whole thing explodes, and leds him on a journey to find his one true love Ada back at Cold Mountain. Inman faces a perilous journey where he is captured, held at gunpoint, as well as dealing with prostitutes and the homes guardsmen of the South. The movie starts out very strong with the Battle of Petersburg, but quickly fades and slows down leaving audiences bored. However, director Anthony Minghella did display a work that was very unique regarding a Civil War film. Technically, this film is very pleasing. Minghella captured correct lighting to show the emotions of the era, and particular characters, yet did not cast properly. Renee Zellweger's character of Ruby was the only believable character in the film, when it came to the ""look"" and accent.

518,kalan_lover_101,Cold Mountain full of great actors and a thought-out plot.,9,26 August 2006,"As I look out on today's popular movies, it's hard to find some that have a good plot that balances out well with the action sequences. The problem with movies like Dead Mans chest, is that they try to incorporate too much action sequences, and leave behind an tangled mess of a plot. Cold Mountain seems to hit the jackpot. It can keep people who are just interested in the sex or violence in it, as well as captivating those who like intimate plots and a beautiful storyline. Cold Mountain seems to have all the right aspects. Cold Mountain does have it's weaker moments, but they are stronger than most movies highest. What appears to be a weakness to me, is that Nicole Kidman, who is always looking beautiful, doesn't change with the environment she is put in. She always looks perfect and like her make-up has just been done. Even when she does labor, her cheeks are still as rosy as they always were, her lipstick just as red and every hair in place.

520,cptklogg,A likable movie disrupted by disturbing improbables ...,6,2 January 2006,"I realize I must sound like a bit of a flake, but the improbable deaths of the Swangers almost ruined this film for me. I would just as soon not have had all the violence that opened and continued in the film to show me that ""war is hell"", but, I was revulsed by the gore and aware of its relation to war, so, I suppose, it accomplished its purpose, and, anyway, I might not have liked the film as much as I did w/o being manipulated that way. And I wasn't tremendously put off by the historical improbability, as I understand it, of much of what the movie depicted. Neither Confedrate nor Union Army was much for rape during the war, so the historians tell us, and I am willing to believe, but I can't believe some of it didn't go on. Likewise, neither North Carolina rural farmers nor those anywhere else outside of certain border state areas were much afflicted with the relatively able-bodied and well supplied Home Guard depicted here, but there may have been some, and I'm willing to afford a degree of license to the director. But the way the Swangers were murdered was so bizarrely unbelievable, that it jarred me out of the suspension of reason that I'd been willing to afford the film up to that point and made me walk away from it; had I been watching CM in a theater, I likely would have stifled myself for ten minutes or so and then walked out (yes, I also don't take exception to the criticism that the movie seemed overlong). The murder of Mr. Swanger was jarring enough, there had been entirely too little precedent in the movie to establish that the Home Guarders had broken that far with the social contract that they'd had w/ their pre-War neighbors, forgetting the fact that such lawlessness is entirely at odds with the historical record. But then to have the sons come running to their deaths immediately thereafter is too much of an absurdity to tolerate. We are expected to believe that the sons had fought for three years in the bloodiest conflagration to occur in the Western Hemisphere and then, somehow, become so rattled at the actual/potential death of their parents that they run to their deaths like lemmings over a cliff? What detachment did they desert from, one guarding Jefferson Davis in Richmond? Every major Confederate battle unit had suffered severe casualties by the beginning of 1864; even the most innocent of veterans had combat instincts that were not going to be swept aside by death/danger to a loved one, death and dismemberment of one's friends were too constant companions. These battle hardened soldiers came running to their deaths with loaded firearms in their hands! With the enemy in plain view? The likelihood is just too absurd. There were any number of quick and gory ways of killing the Swangers off available to the director that weren't as offensive to logic as the ones chosen; they should have been picked and the scenes used consigned to the cutting room floor. The superb acting - particularly the appealing relationship developed between the Zellweger/Kidman characters - deserved better accompaniment.",Cold Mountain
