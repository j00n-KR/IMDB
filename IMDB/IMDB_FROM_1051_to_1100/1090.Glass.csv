0,Leofwine_draca,"Works, generally",6,1 January 2020,"GLASS is an unusual beast, a sequel to two separate movies: UNBREAKABLE and SPLIT. I love the former movie and enjoyed the latter, despite thinking it a bit gimmicky; this film ties together both plots into a largely satisfying whole while at the same time building on the shared universe's superhero mythos. This is one of the director's better movies of recent years, although it's still not perfect: it goes on a bit too long, and the double-twist ending made me think ""so what?"" rather than being genuinely impressed by it all. However, the performances are all strong - Willis dependable, Jackson understated for a change, McAvoy a showstopper - and the quiet, non-showy direction works a treat.",Glass
1,SnoopyStyle,the journey of our characters,6,2 May 2019,"David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is now a vigilante working closely with his son. They are investigating a series of missing young women. Kevin Crumb (James McAvoy) has unleashed the Beast upon his victims and is holding four cheerleaders prisoners. David battles Kevin but they are interrupted by the police and Dr. Ellie Staple (Sarah Paulson) who uses strobe lights to control Kevin. She holds them in her institute along with Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson). Her goal is to convince them that their superpowers are nothing more than delusions. Price's mother (Charlayne Woodard), Dunn's son (Spencer Treat Clark), and Casey Cooke (Anya Taylor-Joy) try to intervene.M. Night Shyamalan delivers his superhero trilogy. I have issues with the story structure of Unbreakable. I like Split better. This one falls somewhere in the middle. From the start, I assumed that Staple to be the new super human. I never bought into her explanations or the world in general. Something is obviously off. The legality of the situation seems problematic. David should get a better lawyer or even any lawyer. When the reveal happens, none of it surprises me. The story needs a reality check. I really like the initial battle at the beginning. The institution doesn't have the needed tension. The audience isn't given the story elements to believe that it's all a delusion. What works are the characters. They are compelling characters built up over two movies. We are invested in them. We are interested in their journey. It's a compelling watch all the way to the end because of them. They make this movie work.",Glass
2,Prismark10,The signs are there,8,4 April 2019,"You can get a sequel to one film. Glass is a sequel to two different movies that span several decades and different production companies. Split (2016) and Unbreakable (2000).David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is the vigilante who plans to catch Kevin Crumb (James McAvoy) the man with multiple personalities including the Beast, who has abducted four cheerleaders. After a showdown both get captured and sent to Raven Hill Memorial hospital which has been adapted to keep them both locked in their rooms.Also inside the hospital is Mr Glass (Samuel L Jackson) almost comatose filled with drugs and confined to his wheelchair because of his brittle bones. The man who killed hundreds to prove a theory that some people had extraordinary powers. The kind of powers you find in comic books.Dr Ellie Staple (Sarah Paulson) has been sent in to show these three people that they are normal people, their abnormal frontal lobes making them think they have superpowers.M. Night Shyamalan after his initial success with movies like The Sixth Sense and later flops such as The Happening. He went back to basics and re-invented himself through low budget independent horror/thrillers. It culminated in the critically acclaimed Split.In Glass, Shyamalan pits Dunn against the Beast but it is also a tease. The film is called Glass. Watching and waiting is Elijah Price/Mr Glass. He has woven a web, his body is weak but his mind is sharp. That is his superpower. His past actions has led to the present and he envisages a comic strip superbattle.Shyamalan has made the movie he wanted to make. The pace is deliberate, it alludes to comic book conventions but without taking the Marvel Films route. I thought it was wonderful even if the movie had faults.",Glass
3,nogodnomasters,You're not one of those Hello Kitty pervs?,8,2 February 2019,"Dr. Ellie Staple (Sarah Paulson) works at the Raven Hill Sanitarium in Philadelphia. She studies patients who believe they have superpowers and tries to convince them they are normal. Her three patients include David Dunn (Bruce Willis) who is a vigilante. Mr. Glass (Samuel L. Jackson) is confined to a wheelchair and has a brittle bone ailment. His superpower is his mind. Kevin Crumb (James McAvoy) has multiple personalities, one of which is ""The Beast.""Comic books are the real history books. The film was an interesting twist on mutants or X-Men. Unfortunately, there was too much non-action in the asylum and Samuel L. Jackson doesn't make an appearance until 40 minutes into the feature and doesn't speak much. Anyone else notice this is a sequel to ""Split?""Guide: No f-words, sex, or nudity.",Glass
4,kosmasp,Finish line,7,6 June 2019,"When Unbreakable came out - I don't think anyone could have imagined where that movie would lead us. I remember that I did like it, but I have to rewatch it to really write a review. But Split was not released that long ago and remembering that character and also the cameo Bruce Willis had in the end of that movie (or after the credits if you will) kind of makes up for that. I do think that it makes sense having certain things fresh in mind, but an overall understanding is enough I reckon.I have to admit this went quite differently than I thought. The addition of Sarah Paulson might annoy some (her character that is, Sarah herself seems like a great and funny person), but is necessary for the story. When it comes to the ending (and you should expect this to twist again - sort of), the scope is big, the overall sensation is missing though. It felt a bit underwhelming for what it actually is suggesting. So this is really good and it ties up neatly .... but where is the emotion? I do think that might be an issue for some. Still curious to go back and revisit Unbreakable",Glass
5,Sleepin_Dragon,"The critics once again, know nothing!",9,30 January 2019,"If you believed everything that was written by critics, your movie viewing options would be high limited. I'm my opinion they got Glass badly wrong, what's slated for being dull and flawed is actually a terrific movie. It had be captivated, I loved Split, and it literally felt like I was returning to the cinema to watch events directly after that great movie.I thought the film had a very grounded feel, never did it go utterly bonkers, or dip and lose my attention. I thought the way they concluded it was fantastic, opting for a showdown that wasn't the typical superhero style, displayed on top of the new huge building, if anything they underplayed it.Fantastic direction, sound, action etc, but as with Split, it was the phenomenal performance of James McAvoy that had me hooked, once again he switched from character to character with ease, even his demeanor and facial expressions told you which persona he was in before speaking, quite extraordinary.Enough tension, enough action, and more then enough story to keep you totally entertained.Exceeded my expectations. 9/10",Glass
6,classicsoncall,"""If super-heroes exist, why are there only three of you?""",8,11 June 2019,"Having seen all three films in the Shyamalan trilogy, I'm still not going along with the premise that the story was about people possessing comic book, super-hero abilities. Extraordinary physical and psychic abilities, yes, but not enough to qualify them for The Avengers or The Justice League. The closest any of the characters comes is David Dunn's (Bruce Willis) status as ""Unbreakable"", and even then, one might consider his surviving a massive train wreck as incredibly good luck. What this story does is pit three individuals of widely divergent talents and (dis)abilities for and against each other in a tense, psychological drama that plumbs the depths of rational and irrational behaviors. Unlike many viewers, I wasn't upset about all the principal characters dying at the finale; what bothered me was the motivation of Dr. Elle Staple (Sarah Paulson). She appeared to betray her profession to learn as much as she could for the benefit of mankind by analyzing the psyches and abilities of Dunn, Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), and Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy). Instead, she was the leader of a cabal to eliminate those with innate capabilities beyond normal understanding. David learned this, and it became the instrument of his undoing. It might have been better if we had an insight or an inkling into Dr. Staple's background to better understand why she had it out for the protagonists in the picture. Yet for all that, I thought this was a compelling story with a phenomenal performance by McAvoy, who positions himself as a contender for the role of a 'real' super-hero villain at some point down the road. Too bad ""Joker"" is already spoken for.",Glass
7,lee_eisenberg,it works to go for the eerie stuff,7,12 July 2019,"M. Night Shyamalan made an interesting movie with ""Split"". It was no ""Sixth Sense"", but still worth seeing. ""Glass"" turns out to be equally mind-bending, with the characters from ""Glass"" and ""Unbreakable"" meeting. And there are some other people to add to the mix.Maybe the movie goes a little too far in posing the question of whether or not superheroes exist, but I liked the tricks that Shyamalan played; basically, he needs to make more movies like this and fewer like ""The Happening"". Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson and James McAvoy put on the performances of their lives. I also hope that Sarah Paulson (whom one of my friends met in New York) gets more roles like her role here.",Glass

9,BA_Harrison,Glass < Split < Unbreakable.,4,21 January 2019,"After carefully establishing a new super villain in the form of The Beast (one of the many personalities of Kevin Wendall Crumb) in Split, director M. Night Shyamalan does precisely what I feared he would do with Glass and wastes all of the series' potential. For the majority of this movie's two and a half hours runtime, the three main characters - Crumb (James McAvoy), David Dunn (Bruce Willis) and Mr. Glass (Samuel L. Jackson) - have virtually no interaction and are given very little to do other than to sit and stew in a psychiatric institution where Dr. Ellie Staple (Sarah Paulson) tries to convince them that they're not so special after all. I can't say I was enthralled by this, but hoped that a blistering final act would make all of the waiting worthwhile. Fat chance...When Crumb, Dunn and Glass finally face each other outside the institution, we get a lame smackdown that fails to generate excitement, followed by the sudden deaths of all three characters and a couple of Shyamalan's weakest twist endings (and that's saying something): 1) Staple is actually part of a secret organisation tasked with controlling superhumans, and 2) before he dies, Glass uploads footage of Dunn and Crumb fighting to the internet to prove their existence (as if people believe everything they see on the web is real).As in Split, McAvoy impresses with his ability to switch between many different personalities, but to be honest, even his performance starts to irritate, a case of too much of a good thing.4/10. The weakest of the Unbreakable series.",Glass
10,tavm,M. Night Shyamalan's Glass confused me though it probably didn't help I wasn't completely awake during much of it...,3,7 February 2019,"When M. Night Shyamalan's Unbreakable came out way back in 2000, I remember enjoying it but it's now been about 19 years since then and I didn't know about his Split-which shared some characters with Unbreakable-from a few years ago but I hoped watching his Glass which now shared characters from both movies would bring it all back to me. While it probably didn't help that I was sleep during some of the beginning scenes, I have a feeling if I was wide awake the whole time, I still wouldn't make sense of it all. Especially when the Samuel L. Jackson character seemed less energetic compared to other characters he played. In summary, Glass seemed a confusing mess to me and my movie theatre-working friend.",Glass
11,Coventry,"You break it, you buy it",1,22 October 2021,"Note to self: stop watching films of which you know from beforehand you'll end up hating them! After recently having re-watched ""Unbreakable"" (and liking it much more than the first time around in 2000), and being pleasantly surprised by the rawness of ""Split"", I felt morally obliged to give ""Glass"" a fair chance as well. Kind of like the ""you break it, you buy it"" principle, which is quite appropriate for a movie named ""Glass"". But, somewhere in the back of my head, I just knew M. Night Shyamalan was going to screw things up again, because he remains a vastly overrated writer/director, and simply cannot make two half-decent movies in a row.In ""Glass"", Shyamalan reverts to his same old and dreadfully frustrating routines again. With this I mean the film has a dull and talkative plot with a pretentious atmosphere and pseudo-intelligent themes, but it is almost without any noteworthy action sequences or suspense. He also feels the need again to insert a whole lot of pointless symbolism and a couple of hopelessly idiotic end-twists. Let go of your trademarks, Mr. Director, it'll do your career good.The film supposedly unites the protagonists of the aforementioned ""Unbreakable"" and ""Split"", but for the vast majority of its running time, the three of them are stuck in a room in a mental institution. The new and utterly loathsome ""villainous"" character is a female psychiatrist who devotes her talking sessions to persuading the trio they are basically normal people. Wow, what a great concept! Here you have a guy with super-strength who survived a deadly train crash, a psychopathic mass-murderer with a physical disability, and a schizophrenic nut with 23 personalities, and what do you choose to do? Put them in white rooms and a chat a little! When the ultimate confrontation finally comes, literally on the parking lot outside of the sanitarium, it is every bit as boring and disappointing as I feared it would be. The two or three ""twists"" that follow at the end make it even worse.It's been a long time since I rated a film with the minimum score of 1/10, but I honestly can't find any redeeming qualities in ""Glass"". The performance(s) of McAvoy was impressive in ""Split"", but quickly becomes very annoying here. I also love the fantastic young actress Anya Taylor-Joy, but her role here is utterly meaningless. Me thinks she more or less felt forced to accept because ""Split"" was one of the films that launched her career. Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jacksons are mere shadows of the great actors they used to be. I find there's absolutely nothing to recommend about ""Glass"", but I'm sure many people will claim I completely missed the point again.",Glass
12,michaelRokeefe,Weird brain bruiser from M. Night Shyamalan,8,9 July 2020,"A psychological thriller written, directed and produced by M. Night Shayamalan. This is the final installment of a trilogy including his UNBREAKABLE (2000) and SPLIT (2016). Three weeks have passed since three young girls were kidnapped by a man (James McAvoy) suffering dissociative identity disorder that can manifest at least two dozen personalities. McAvoy is superb! This film also features Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Anya Taylor-Joy, Shannon Destiny Ryan, Diana Silvers Luke Kirby and Adam David Thompson.

13,LeonLouisRicci,COMIC BOOKS 101...LONG...THICK...HEAVY DREAD,7,3 September 2021,"Almost Two Decades in the Making.This is Sort of a Follow-Up-Sequel to ""Unbreakable"" (2000) and ""Split"" (2017).M. Night Shyamalan has been Trying to Emerge from a Career Slump.Some Say He Has, but it's Still Debatable in Certain Circles.These Two Movies that He is Riffing here are of Different Epochs in the Writer/Director's Filmography.""Unbreakable"" is Arguably His Best Film, even to this Late Date.So it is a Welcome Return to a More Pleasing Time, although ""Split"" was mostly a Critical Success.This one, Not So Much. It Received a Luke Warm Reception All Around.""Glass' is a Movie that can seem so Sophomoric at times in Dealing with its Conceit of ""Comic Book Intelligentsia"".The Deconstruction is Pedantic, Pedestrian, and could be Acceptable in an ""Introduction"" Course.But Shyamalan Lays it on so Serious and Thick that it Screams of Pretentious Platitudes that are so Shop-Worn even ""Newbies"" might Cringe.Other than that Anchor Weighing the Proceedings, the Movie has a Relentless Tone of Dread and a Certain Spooky Atmosphere that the Director Excels.It's Talky to a Fault, especially for the Genre, and it Moves at a Lumbering, Lethargic Pace.The Acting is Good and the Quirky Characters Abound making it an Interesting if Unengaging Watch for most Audience Expectations.The Look of the Movie is Artistically Accommodating and Striking to the Eye, and there's a Certain Off-Beat, Other-Worldly Charm.Just Like Comic Books.",Glass
14,zardoz-13,"""Glass"" Isn't Shatterproof",4,5 February 2019,"""Sixth Sense"" writer & director M. Night Shyamalan's psychological superhero thriller ""Glass"" concludes the East Rail 177 Trilogy that his earlier epic ""Unbreakable"" (2000) launched and his previous outing ""Split"" (2016) followed. Better than ""Unbreakable,"" not as emotionally gratifying as ""Split,"" ""Glass"" chronicles the events that ensue after Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy) pulled off a vanishing act in ""Split."" Meantime, since ""Split,"" this deranged, multi-personality, serial killer has remained at large in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. When ""Split"" came out, nobody knew Shyamalan would link ""Split"" to ""Unbreakable,"" particularly the diners' comparison of Crumb to Glass. ""Split"" introduced moviegoers to Crumb and his 'Horde' of 24 personalities that formed a bulwark against the grim reality of his traumatic adolescence. His sadistic mom, Penelope (Rosemary Howard of ""Super Troopers 2""), tortured him, after his father died in a train wreck. Similarly, one of Crumb's hostages, Casey Cooke (Anya Taylor-Joy of ""The Witch"") had suffered abuse at the hands of her decadent uncle. Since ""Unbreakable,"" the taciturn David Dunn has maintained a low-profile, because he knows the authorities have their eyes on him. Nevertheless, he still moonlights as a vigilante and uses his superhuman qualities to thwart random street crimes.In ""Glass,"" Shyamalan has brought the ultimate villainous mastermind, Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson of ""Pulp Fiction""), David Dunn (Bruce Willis of ""Armageddon""), and Kevin Crumb together as a psychotic riff on ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."" Naturally, if you have seen neither ""Unbreakable"" nor ""Split,"" you may find yourself at a severe disadvantage where the characters are concerned. Interestingly, Spencer Clark Treat, who played David Dunn's young son in ""Unbreakable,"" reprises his role as Dunn's adult son Joseph. Anya Taylor-Joy encores as Casey Cooke, one of Crumb's abducted high school students who survived 'the Beast.' Finally, Charlayne Woodard returns as Mr. Glass' doting mother. The first two acts of ""Glass"" deliver exciting, action-packed drama, bristling with intrigue. Sadly, the anticlimactic third act doesn't witness the triumph of good over evil, but a compromise. Comparably, this third act is reminiscent of ""Avengers: Infinity Wars."" Moreover, Shyamalan has said publicly that he has no plans for a fourth film. Not surprisingly, McAvoy's hammy, hyperactive performance, as he skips elusively from one personality to another, overshadows his straightforward co-stars. That's a whole lot of winking on McAvoy's part. By comparison, Mr. Glass and David Dunn appear dull and dreary.Shyamalan has created a new character for ""Glass."" Creepy, but conscientious, this reserved research psychologist, Dr. Ellie Staple (Sarah Paulson of ""Ocean's Eight""), treats patients afflicted with delusions of grandeur. Curiously, after admitting all three to Raven Hill Memorial Hospital, Staple points out she has only three days to convince them that they have nothing in common with comic book super heroes. Shyamalan never justifies this arbitrary 72-hour deadline. Dr. Staple has tailored their accommodations carefully so nobody can escape. These scenes generate more excitement than the talky, therapeutic panel discussion about their superhuman powers. She has incarcerated Crumb and his 'Horde' of personalities in a room equipped with banks of blinding strobe lights. These activate automatically when Crumb crosses a line or behaves in an aggressive manner. Every time the lights blaze at him, Crumb changes from one personality to another. Nothing he can do enables him to escape. Another former trauma victim, football stadium security guard David Dunn, who nearly drowned in a community swimming pool in his youth, confronts similar obstacles. If David moves too far in his cell, a battery of water nozzles installed in the ceiling is poised to saturate him into submission. Dr. Staple struggles to convince Dunn that his super heroic manifestations are a byproduct of his near-death experience. Finally, not only does Staple keep Mr. Glass heavily medicated, but she also orders the installation of additional surveillance cameras, so her staff can keep track of his escapades. Later, the villainous mastermind reveals to Kevin when he visits him that he is one step ahead of Staple. Just as Mr. Glass crashed the East Rail 177, so David Dunn would realize his miraculous powers, he is also responsible for Crumb's warped multiple-personality and the rise of 'the Beast.' As it turns out, Kevin's father, Clarence Crumb (newcomer Bryan McElroy), boarded the same train that Mr. Glass sabotaged, and Clarence died, leaving his poor son in his wife's treacherous hands. If you find Mr. Glass's machinations slightly preposterous, you're not alone.Nevertheless, far-fetched as Mr. Glass' scheme is, the last-minute surprise at the end of ""Glass""--appears even more outlandish. In the final quarter hour, after Mr. Glass, David Dunn, and 'the Beast' have broken out of the hospital, we learn Dr. Staple's secret. Literally, she as well as an anonymous group of others like her have something up their collective sleeves. She summons the Philadelphia Police, with their SWAT teams, and watches as they subdue Dunn and 'the Beast.' 'The Beast' had locked two female mental hospital attendants in a vehicle, but David released them once he whipped 'the Beast.' Imagine David's surprise when the SWAT team tackles him as well as 'the Beast' to regain control of the situation. What follows undermines everything before it. Although our hero and villains prove themselves endowed beyond any doubt with superhuman powers, the ending is dreadfully depressing.Writer & director M. Night Shyamalan springs not one but several of his usual last-minute surprises. Each has an incredible but gratuitous, tacked-on quality. Reportedly, according to Shyamalan, this complicated ending was something he had planned as far back as 2000 when he helmed ""Unbreakable."" My earlier comparison between the comic book heroes in ""Glass"" and those in ""Avengers: Infinity War"" seems too good to be true. The outcome of David Dunn's fight with the SWAT team is tragic as is the demise of 'the Beast.' Nevertheless, Shyamalan isn't content to hit us with only two surprises but also a third. Altogether, the ""Unbreakable,"" ""Split,"" and ""Glass"" trilogy amounts to nothing less than an elaborate but implausible conspiracy thriller!",Glass
15,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,More than half full,8,19 January 2019,"David(Willis, stoic) has fully embraced the role of hero, and routinely takes down violent criminals. He's looking for one in particular: The Horde(McAvoy, with several new alters for him to act), who continue to unleash The Beast on increasingly larger groups. But both are put in a mental institution, that seeks to rid them of their delusions of grandeur, led by Dr Staple(Paulson, compassionate as she tries to bring them back to reality). There, they are joined by Elijah(Jackson, on his quest, deeply compelling as the mastermind). Can Dunn prevent them from escaping and killing dozens of people?I respectfully disagree with most criticisms of this film. This does a great job of putting every returning character(all six of them) into places that are both new to them, and logical as growth from where they used to be. Not to mention having interesting things result of the meeting of the casts of the previous two movies. I'm not going to claim that this is entirely satisfying in bringing them together, and as a sequel to a nearly two decades old picture, it doesn't completely live up to hopes for it. ""How could it possibly"" is not sufficient in explaining why it doesn't. Some developments were exactly what we had already guessed they would be - it almost feels as though this was made by people who don't know what internet speculation is. Parts of the ending, which can feel like it goes on forever, ironically seem as though they simply stop part way through. I will say that the twist, or some of them, rather, blew my mind. When Shyamalan nails that aspect, it's amazing. His signature style is impressive, coming off as chosen because it fits the material, more often than not. The action is memorable and well choreographed, even if there could be more of it.There is a lot of disturbing material, and a small amount of moderate violence, in this. I recommend this to fans of comic books and of this Cinematic Universe. 8/10",Glass
16,neil-476,An unusual and effective sequel to two films,9,1 November 2020,"In Unbreakable, we met Elijah Price, a brittle bone sufferer who engineered a multi-fatality accident in order to prove that David Dunn was a superhero with great strength and resistance to physical harm. Then writer/director M Night Shyamalan's run of critical and commercial hits entered a downward spiral, culminating in the awful The Last Airbender.After some years spent rebuilding his career, Shyamalan came out with Split, in which one of Kevin's multiple personalities is The Beast, who has a tendency to kidnap and muder young women. The very end of Split teases us with David Dunn, making it clear that the two films are connected.And so we come to Glass, in which, after some exposition and plot engineering, Elijah, David, and Kevin end up in the same psychiatric unit, where Dr Ellie Staple is trying to deal with the mental condition of people who think they are superheroes.Shyamalan has done a good job here. This is a good and original story, well scripted, with resolutions for the three main characters which make sense, and two late plot doglegs which are quite fair but not easy to anticipate. It is also well directed, with some excellent directorial choices.Thanks are due to Bruce Willis for playing the very necessary but lowest key of the principals. McAvoy, as in Split, gets to do masses of showing off and, boy, is he good!",Glass
17,ferguson-6,split decision,5,17 January 2019,"Greetings again from the darkness. It's pretty simple. If you are a fan of UNBREAKABLE (2000) and SPLIT (2016), then you need to see this finale to M. Night Shyamalan's trilogy. If neither of the two previous films tickled your creep fancy, then you'll likely find nothing of interest here. The biggest fear is that fans of the first two (like me) will be disappointed and frustrated (like me) by the missed opportunity. Rather than real world super abilities clashing, we get what is mostly a silly letdown.The set-up is outstanding. David Dunn (Bruce Willis) and his now-grown son Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark) have teamed up for years in tracking down lowlife societal scumbags and teaching them a lesson. Mostly avoiding cameras (more difficult now than when he first realized his power), Dunn now has a nickname, The Overseer, and still dons his green poncho - though it's now equipped with a headset for communication with Joseph.The Dunn men have been tracking Kevin Wendell Crumb (with a Beetlejuice twist), who has kidnapped more teenage girls and is holding them hostage. James McAvoy returns as Kevin, and his 23 other personalities (referred to as The Horde), and early in the movie we get our first Dunn vs. The Beast battle. Unfortunately, it's brief and ends in their capture and being locked away in an institution. And this is where the fun comes screeching to a halt.It's at the institution where we discover Elijah Wood/Mr. Glass (Samuel L Jackson) is also being held, and Dr Elle Staple (Sarah Paulson) is the psychologist specializing in treating those who believe they possess super human traits, be they good or evil. This misdirected plot line is our first real frustration, as we have already seen the super strength of Dunn, the massive transformation of The Beast, and the villainous mastermind of Elijah. By definition there is no suspense when we know the answer. Because of this, the entire treatment segment drags on far too long, and features entirely too much of Ms. Paulson, and too little of those we came to see.Also reprising their previous roles are Anya Taylor-Joy as Casey, the only surviving former captive of Kevin, and Charlayne Woodward as Elijah's mother. Ms. Woodward is given little to do, and Ms. Taylor-Joy's strong acting almost saves her from the ludicrous script ... a development we intellectually understand, but emotionally refuse to accept. In fact, the script is to blame for most of our frustration here. McAvoy is again tremendous in his ability to convey multiple personalities, and Jackson, once he is no longer catatonic (never a good use of a dynamic actor), relishes his return to evil. There is an interesting use of color for the three main characters: Dunn - green, Kevin - yellow, and Elijah - purple, and the cinematography of Mike Gioulakis (IT FOLLOWS) contributes some unusual angles and views.Disney and Universal are to be commended for a rare rival studio collaboration, and M Night Shyamalan certainly deserves credit for being on the front end (with UNBREAKABLE) of the serious, dark, atmospheric superhero movie perfected by Christopher Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, but this film is nothing to be proud of. The film's twist is easily predictable (and dragged out), and some parts are disappointing while some are an insult to our intelligence ... and downright silly (the ending). Still, there is a certain value to closure, even if it's a letdown.",Glass
18,bombersflyup,Waste of talent and potential.,2,4 April 2019,"Glass is basically a re-hash of the second film, expanding on nothing.Willis and Jackson are back, but don't have significant roles with McAvoy the centerpiece. Which is a huge mistake, as McAvoy again is quite annoying and they're both greats in the field. I like that Willis's character's son's played by Spencer Clark, same as the first film. He does a good job, why his character's sitting with Jackson's character's mother at the end baffles me though, as she raised a monster and he's good. The footage being uploaded to the net's a poor ending and I don't see how anybody's life changes the following day because of it. Unbreakable's a remarkable film however and the only reason I gave this a chance.",Glass
19,deloudelouvain,James McAvoy kills it.,8,11 April 2019,"Unbreakable is just too far away for me to completely remember, the only thing I remembered was that I liked it. Split on the other hand is still fresh in my memory, a movie that I really enjoyed, especially for the convincing acting skills of James McAvoy. In Glass James McAvoy excels again, he's by far the best actor in this movie, and that not only due to his exceptionally weird character. Bruce Willis is just an okay actor, nothing brilliant, it seems like I know all his facial expressions even before they occure. Samuel L. Jackson had more of a silent role but even then I thought he was better than Bruce Willis. Glass took another direction in the end than I thought it would, so that was a surprise, i don't really know if I liked that route though. For that I will have to binge watch Unbreakable, Split and Glass again, an option that I already look forward to as the three movies are all better than the usual stuff..",Glass
20,namashi_1,An Interesting Spin On Superheroes!,7,20 January 2019,"Writer-Director M. Night Shyamalan's sequel to the director's previous films Unbreakable and Split , 'Glass' is the director's most ambitious attempt in years. And the man helming this recent box-office Hit, gives his Superhero saga an interesting spin. So, if you go in thinking that this will be a yet another Superhero movie with the usual cliches and it's generic tropes, you're in the wrong movie. Shyamalan flirts with the ideas of Superheroes, but gives us a tale on what makes one special and how one's gift cannot be denied or contained, irrespective of the people who want to destroy it.'Glass' follows David Dunn (Bruce Willis) who gets locked in a mental hospital alongside his once-rival Mr. Glass, (Samuel L. Jackson) as well as the multi-personality ""The Horde"" (James McAvoy) and must escape from a psychiatrist (Sarah Paulson) who is out to prove the trio do not actually possess super-human abilities.'Glass' combines Shyamalan's very own Superheroes to deliver a spectacle that will keep you invested, although it lags in parts. Yes, 'Glass' isn't perfect, but what makes the film work overall is how it pushes the audience to think beyond the usual mayhem and over-the-top nature of Superhero Blockbusters have turned out to be. While there is action here and some true thrill too, this superhero-thriller flick is more about exploring one's self. We watch the three characters locked in a mental ward by a psychiatrist who wouldn't let them be who they are, thus, arresting them from their superpowers. Shyamalan keeps the narrative progressive and the connections between the 2 previous films prior to this, add up nicely. But his message and vision of making 'Glass' remains clear: You are who you are and the truth of being special, cannot be denied!Shyamalan's Screenplay definitely could've been sharper, though. While I enjoyed the themes and particularly the film's final act, the Writing lags in the middle portions. Also, the narrative doesn't gather much speed in the first-hour, it's only when Sam Jackson's Mr.Glass comes into play and the film grabs you. The middle bits, particularly the continuous jabbering by the psychiatrist, is given too much screen-time, but hardly leaves any impact. Simply put, The film begins with a bang, then slows down for a good 30-minutes, and then picks up for a truly enjoyable second-hour. And a word for the much-talked about culmination of the film: Rousing! Shyamalan's view of superpowers and his brave approach to do away from the cliches, is rather innovative and impactful.Shyamalan's Direction is commendable. The man is in form this time, and despite his own Writing not giving him support all through, he Directs the film with a distinctive style. Mike Gioulakis's Cinematography is excellent. The Lens-Man's work is especially impressive when he goes for the close-ups, that explore the intensity of it's characters. Luke Ciarrocchi and Blu Murray's Editing could've been a little more crisper, but it's decent nonetheless. Art and Costume Design are well-done. West Dylan Thordson's Score is excellent.Performance-Wise: Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson and James McAvoy reprise their popular roles and none of them disappoint. Willis is restrained as the unbreakable hero, delivering a controlled performance from start to end. Sam Jackson has a blast as the conniving Mr.Glass, who despite his bad deeds, makes us feel for him by the time the film ends. And McAvoy is absolutely sensational as The Horde/ Kevin Wendell Crumb, the multiple personality brat, who's flair for change is a joy to watch. His change of personalties are funny and scary, in equal measure. Sarah Paulson is one-note as the adamant psychiatrist. Anya Taylor-Joy,
Spencer Treat Clark and Charlayne Woodard return to their roles and deliver credibly.On the whole, 'Glass' pushes the Superhero Genre to interesting results. While it's not perfect and will not appeal to all, for a change of pace, it works well! I recommend it.",Glass

22,cherold,A movie with some good performances and intriguing ideas that would have been pretty good if it had had a decent ending,6,1 June 2019,"Once upon a time, director M. Knight Shyamalan was the champion of endings. The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, and Signs all had these terrific mind-blowing twist endings. And while later endings didn't always work, and weren't always twists, it was clear Shyamalan at least understood how important the ending was.Then there's Glass, which is actually positioned as the last leg of a trilogy yet doesn't even have enough ending for one movie.After the entertaining Split offered up a coda (*not* a twist) with an appearance by David Dunn from the ingenious but rather tedious Unbreakable, Glass puts it all together. Dunn and Split's James McAvoy are both supernatural, so why not put them in a movie together. They are caught and held in a facility for those with ""illusions"" of superpowers along with Unbreakable's Elijah Price.It's an interesting premise, and James McAvoy is once again electric as the multiple-personality horde, even if it feels like more of a reprise than something new.There are a few twists, most pretty easy to predict, one less so, none with the feel of a classic Shyamalan twist.It's all really pretty decent, really, and enjoyable more often than not. I like this very different take on superheroes, and the action at the end was actually pretty good. But ...************* SPOILERS START HERE **************************
The final ""twist"" is that Elijah had set up his own death (all the superheroes die, which in the case of Dunn I found not so much sad as just annoying, since it seemed hard to believe no one would have seen what was happening and it served no dramatic purpose beyond a writer's need for symetry) so that all the superhero antics would be on video. Where did that video go? To Dunn's son, the surviving victim from Split, Casey (who inexplicably involves herself in the drama), and Glass's mom. They release the video to the public, fulfilling Elijah's dream that humans realize they have vast potential with the goal, seemingly, of creating tons of superheroes.This is a terrible, terrible ending.First off, why would Dunn's son be eager to fulfill the vision of the man responsible for his death? Similar question for Casey, who learned Elijah was responsible for the monster who tortured her as well as responsible for the death of that monster when Casey was attached to him.And yet, they dutifully follow Glass's wishes.To make it worse, the movie portrays this as somehow a good thing. At the end it comes off a bit like some infomercial about the unlimited capacity of the human mind. No, Shyamalan, this isn't an uplifting ending. And guess what, it *shouldn't* be an uplifting ending. A psycopath murdered some people and caused others to die in pursuit of a really stupid version of a self-help program.If Glass had a decent ending I would give it a 7, because in spite of some slow bits I enjoyed it. If it had a Sixth Sense/Signs level ending I'd give it an 8. But seriously, there is no excuse to end a movie like this.",Glass
23,FeastMode,awesome with some big flaws... maybe,7,6 July 2020,"I LOVED most of this movie. unfortunately it failed to stick the landing. some of the story elements in the finale felt clunky. and there were some side plots that seem totally unnecessary. but the performance by mcavoy combined with the direction by shyamalan helped this movie overcome its flaws.on second viewing, i liked it even more. some of the flaws don't bother me as much. although some still do. and there are certain story elements that i'm starting to appreciate more. while i still see this as a step down from the previous two movies, it's a strong conclusion to the trilogy. and who knows, it seems like the kind of movie that continues to grow on me.

24,Pjtaylor-96-138044,The Glass Jedi.,5,20 January 2019,"Not every movie needs an earth-shattering, experience-altering twist. I still don't think that M. Night Shyamalan's got the memo. However, most of his famed twists serve no function other than as the twist itself and, as such, have no real impact. It doesn't help that pretty much all of them occur right around their respective films' denouement, leaving them no room to alter the narrative going forward. The twist in 'Glass (2019)', which I won't spoil here, is no different. While it's perhaps Shyamalan's tamest, it's also one of his most superfluous. You could cut it right out of the final feature, effecting only a few minutes of late-game screen-time, and it wouldn't even make a difference to the overall result. Its only function, aside from setting up something that's essentially resolved in the next two minutes (possible - if unlikely - sequels, aside), is to paste over some obtuse character-motivation and potentially 'excuse' the logic-lite dialogue involving them. This works about as well as when the characters call out select, genre-specific events as they occur within the plot; that is to say, ""not very"". See, 'hanging a lantern' only works if you then go on to subvert the tropes you're calling out, instead of just stating that you know you're steering straight into them. While there is some broad subversion within the story, it only really serves to put further distance between the final output and its initial intent. It feels like the film is trying to say something, with its characters often talking - seemingly directly to the audience (in straight-to-camera close-ups) - about how comic-books are deceiving your friends and family and how the events of this flick are going to have limits because this is the 'real world', but it doesn't actually say anything at all. If it's trying to be a more realistic take on the superhero genre than the Marvel stuff we're seeing now, then it completely fails. This is probably because it makes the classic mistake of thinking that 'realistic' and 'grounded' are the same thing. Even if its diegesis is initially closer to our own everyday life, it makes a number of 'rule breaking' and, sometimes, downright silly moves, all while saying its the most realistic superhero film you'll ever see, that make it feel far further from our own reality than it intends to. You believe even the most outlandish of MCU pictures because they put their relatable characters first and they never break their own rules, even if you have to believe that aliens or magic exist. Every movie, even the most straight-shooting of documentary, is fake. It can be honest, but it's never going to be 'real life'; it can only be grounded within its own world. The initial 'Unbreakable (2000)' worked so well because it was seemingly one of the first comic-book movies to take its source stuff seriously, playing like a drama with some subtle fantastical and 'meta' elements. When you only have 'Batman (1989)' and his weird, gothic world or 'Superman (1978)' and his 'repair-the-Great-Wall-of-China'-vision to compete with, you've got a pretty good chance of being 'realistic'. Speaking of 'Unbreakable (2000)', this piece doesn't really do it justice. It's contrasted heavily with the over-the-top 'Split (2016)' stuff, especially when it comes to the acting, and it doesn't feel like it's continued in a natural way. Willis seems like he's bored most of the time, with only a few moments bringing back memories of his reserved but powerful prior performance, whereas Jackson is as good as he ever is, no matter the quality of film. McAvoy is doing the most acting here, as his number of personalities is pushed way into the double-figures, but most of his characters are more like quick impersonations and the more major returning ones aren't really given justice. He's also, frankly, quite hammy - though, it's only because he really goes for it that his character works at all. The side characters aren't really characters, even less so than our underdeveloped main players, and one of them in particular is, I feel, incredibly underserved, transformed into an almost 'Stockholm syndrome' romantic interest. I know it sounds like I absolutely hated the flick, but I didn't. It's rather dull until Jackson's role escalates from glorified cameo to actual star, but then, if you're willing to go with it and ignore (or embrace) the fact that it's all so silly, it starts to get rather good. Here, Jackson gets to actually act and we finally see the 'superhero' stuff we've been waiting for. It's good but not great, though. The 'superhero' stuff mainly consists of Willis and McAvoy - or, rather, their stunt-doubles - bashing each other against a truck and even this section isn't devoid of the strange Shyamalan issues (including a screenplay in which, essentially, every line sounds unnatural in some way) that the rest of the affair is. It all culminates in an unceremonious, almost tone-deaf finale that paints the serial-killing villains in an as good, if not better, light than our actual hero and features just as much 'tell-not-show' exposition as the rest of the picture, just saturated into a smaller screen-time to account for that previously mentioned superficial twist. In the end, this is an intermittently entertaining film that's got nothing to say and suffers from the same issues that Shyamalan's been dealing with for, at this point, decades. At the very least, it's interesting to talk about. However, I do find myself liking it less the more I think about it. Really, in this world full of superhero sequels, the most subversive thing Shyamalan could have done would have been to not make this movie at all. Perhaps, for fans of either 'Unbreakable (2000)' or 'Split (2016)', it would have also been the most merciful. 5/10",Glass

Once the characters get to the asylum and are all in the same place, the film comes to a fault for over an hour with boring discussion after boring monologue flooding the screen. The one consistent positive throughout is the performance of James McAvoy, who gives dozens of unique takes as his character constantly goes from character to character. But that performance isn't enough to save this movie from boredom and M. Night going back to his pretentious roots.3.8/10",Glass
27,Cineanalyst,Glass is Reflective: A Comic-Book Movie About its Own Making,8,7 October 2019,"The final part in M. Night Shyamalan's superhero trilogy, ""Glass"" is clever as a meta-narrative about its own making. ""Unbreakable"" (2000) was similarly--although, media-wise, more limited--a movie about a comic-book enthusiast (Mr. Glass) creating a superhero (""the Overseer""). I think ""Split"" (2017) is the disappointment among the trilogy because it largely failed to realize its potential of a character as analogous to cinema and of an actor playing multiple characters in an actorly manner; it was as disparate and disorganized as the mind of its villain. ""Glass"" takes these notions of meta-narrative to the next step--beyond the simple deconstruction of ""Unbreakable"" or something like, say, ""Scream"" (1996), where characters act as though they're in a movie. What Mr. Glass does here is construct the superhero movie, as informed by comic books. It's a glass-mirror image reflecting the same thing Shyamalan has done in making this very picture.Unfortunately, the last time Shyamalan employed this type of self-reflexive meta-narrative, it was one of his most-widely-panned releases and certainly his most pathetically self-indulgent effort in ""Lady in the Water"" (2006), which starred the writer-director himself as the genius author with a martyr complex whose work is misunderstood by a movie critic. Seriously. Years later now, the Shyamalan cameo in ""Glass"" is a man who admits that he's done some bad things in the past, but he's since turned his life around. At least, it appears he's since become a little less blatantly egotistical in his work since ""Lady in the Water,"" as well as, perhaps, less pretentious in his subject matter by turning his attentions here to the popular subject of superheroes instead of water nymphs and whatnot.Nevertheless, ""Glass"" features a mastermind storyteller and director (although played by Samuel L. Jackson instead of Shyamalan), who is tormented by his critics--there being a clandestine organization seeking to prevent him from exposing his stories to the world. Even the way they are depicted here meeting in restaurants seems aimed to make them look like snobs. Anyways, they lock Glass and the other two supers in an asylum for this purpose of shutting them up and to berate them with psychobabble in an attempt to convince that their stories are mistaken--not unlike what many a film critic will do to movies. Meanwhile, us movie-goers are represented on-screen by our surrogate spectators and fans of superheroes: the mother, the son and the orphaned friend. They--and thus, supposedly, us--believe in the awesome power of the superheroes despite what the critics say. In the end, ""Glass"" implies that it doesn't matter what the critics say--they can try to beat his creations to death--but they can't stop him from telling his stories. Mr. Glass finds a way to get his cameras and to distribute the footage to the world, so that all that's left is for him to direct his comic-book-informed characters in a climactic showdown for all to see.",Glass

34,ironhorse_iv,It's time to look through the magnifying glass. Is this movie worth watching? Somewhat.,7,2 February 2019,"This 2019 motion picture written & directed by M Night Shyamalan doesn't quite manages to pull together the two worlds of the previous 'Eastrail 177' films (2000's 'Unbreakable' & 2016's 'Split'), into one cohesive film. It felt somewhat unsatisfying, scattered, and uneven at parts. It likes to subvert your expectations a little too much as well. All the 'red herrings' parts will indeed rub people, the wrong way. The tone is also awful. The movie was light-hearted, cartoony & felt like a farce than anything else. It does not match well with how convincing intense & scary, the previous movies were. Don't get me wrong, it had a good premise with mental patients with Übermensch delusions, having to fight back against the harsh oppressive of the hospital trying to say otherwise; however, the film doesn't dig deep enough in the physiological thriller concept. It doesn't challenge or explore much of the characters' dark potential mental breakdowns. Nor does it show, how the cruel lockdown of the asylum, is making it worst for them, leading to tragic, yet chaotic results. While the movie is rated PG-13, it still need to be bit more unsettling & shocking. It plays the concept way too safe. The film was really tamed in suspense & thrills. Hopefully, 2019's oncoming similar movie 'The New Mutant' could do better than 'Glass', and delivered twist & turns from our deepest, darkest fears. Hopefully, it will scare us! This movie did not. Another thing, this film needs to do better, is make more sense. Without spoiling too much, the film was unrealistic convenience. It felt a bit too structure in places. Examples like, the love ones, all arriving at the one location at the same time during the climax & the fact that all three main characters are somewhat related by past events. Even if it's foreshadow in the first movie, the third act revelation was by far, the worst. Seeing that there is a secret society out to eliminate people with special abilities just doesn't add up! Wouldn't it, make more sense for this secret group to exploit these powers for their own purposes rather than this unrealistic 'beware of superman' belief that Shyamalan has poorly written it as? I believe so! After all, if it wasn't that, what was the point of waiting, nearly 19 years to lobotomize or kill, the extreme comic fanatic, Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) & give the other two, Kevin Crumb (James McAvoy) & David Dunn (Bruce Willis) 3 days to change their mind? From the looks of things, they hardly stop anybody from working & training for those skills and being inspired by the few talented people within their own circles. It seems like they're doing a crappy job. Not only, has they allow the family & friends of the patients to live, and furthermore influence people, but they also alright about comic books being released to the public telling stories of super humans strengths & powers. None of this, makes sense. Honestly, the movie would had been better, if there was no secret society. The idea that the patients might be crazy, is a good enough, dilemma. Regardless, I doubt the ending will make much impact. A viral video of people fighting each other in a courtyard will not raise much eyebrow in the public. There is thousands of those in the internet, far more controversial and entertaining. Most of the audience will probably think of the viral video, as a hoax or special effects commercial stunt. Others will think of it, as boring. After all, this is a world where the average person, attention span is 20 minutes. They will quickly move on to something more eye-opening. According to Samuel L. Jackson, the film originally had a very different ending that needed to be changed due to real life events. Whether or not this ending will ever be made available is unknown. Maybe, one day, we see, what was amended in the direction's cut. After all, the original cut of this film was 3 hours long. A whole 50 minutes longer than the finished version. At least, it's not as a slow moving as 'Unbreakable', in its pacing. Regardless, this movie did a good job, intermixing unused footage from the previous films as flashbacks. I just wish the flick has a lot of fluid camera movements. Several camera angles should had been chosen to simulate the comic book device of a frame around each scene. The same with the use of mirrors and reflective surfaces as shots. You should really get the sense of glass, being a theme, here, but you don't. The same with the color palette. The only great use of that, was the pink room scene. As for the acting. I felt like the main cast were either wasted like Jackson, too cartoony like McAvoy or lackluster like Willis. The only one that kinda shines was Sarah Paulson as the head doctor, Dr. Ellie Staple, even if some of her lines sound really silly. Regardless, it was nice to see some of the supporting cast from the previous movies, reprisal their roles like Spencer Treat Clark, as well, as the creator cameo. However, they kinda wasted Anya & Charlayne Woodard. They're not given much to do, but act like Stockholm syndrome victim & mother unwilling to bare the true that her child is a monster. Both of them, felt counterintuitive and their actions baffling. Why are they alright, spreading the news of killers? That's probably, the most disturbing thing in the film, in a flick, lacking those. Despite, having no scares, the movie was somewhat entertaining, both in action and humor, however, 'Glass' could had been a lot better. In the end, like the trilogy titles represent a spectrum of stability within people. It's by far, the weakest of all the films. This 2019 motion picture is brittle.",Glass
35,Platypuschow,Glass: Passable finale,6,3 April 2019,"As far as Shyamalan movies are concerned I deemed Unbreakable (2000) to be one of the better ones. Though I can confidently say I never saw the potential of a sequel let alone a trilogy.Combining all the characters from Unbreakable (2000) and Split (2016) for one final showdown we see this unexpectedly lengthy story come to a close, but did it deliver?Well I expected the worst, though not terrible I certainly never got on the Split (2016) bandwagon. McAvoy was great, but I don't think the film was. I was however very curious what they were going to do here and it had peaked my interest.Sadly I don't think Glass is great and certainly not as clever as I foolishly expected it to be. Big finale twist? Absolutely, several in fact but they were hardly unexpected nor shocking.The cast delivered and it all looked the part but the trilogy needed to end on something big and I just don't think it did. It ended with a nod instead of a cheer and despite my opinion of the franchise I still felt it deserved better.Passable stuff, entirely watchable but this franchise hasn't left me understanding its critical acclaim in the remotest.The Good:Decent performancesA culmination of an almost 20yr storyThe Bad:Certain elements make little to no senseUnderwhelming and hardly a ""Smart"" film",Glass
36,The-Sarkologist,Are they Delusional?,5,17 January 2019,"I'd thought that Shyamalan had made a superhero film previously, but I could not for the life of me remember what it was called, namely because a part of me wanted to watch it before I watched this one. As it turns out, this is sort of a sequel to that film, in a way that it is also a sequal to Split - it basically rounds out both films and brings them to a conclusion. Mind you, when I say superhero film, it isn't quite what you would expect from DC, and it is definitely not something that you would get from Marvel either, rather this is more of a psychological thriller, in the style that seems to be a trait of Shyamalan's films.It starts off with this guy named David Dunn, who is basically a vigilantie. Then we also have this guy who is best known as The Horde, namely because he has so many different personalities it is mind boggling. The personality that is the focus though is the one known as The Beast, which seems to not only have super strength, but is also able to scale walls.The problem is that these people end up in a psychiatric hospital, namely because superheroes don't exist, and we are lead to believe that they are simply suffering from some sort of delusion due to some traumatic events that occurred during their lives. As such, to protect them not only from themselves, but also the people at large, it has been seen fit to lock them up and attempt to cure them.If anybody has actually seen Shyamalan's first movie, you will basically know that not everything is as it seems. I'm not going to really go into that though because it sort of spoils the film. However, throughout we are left wandering whether they are delusional or not, and whether they actually have super abilties. In some ways you are lead to believe that they have these abilities, but in other ways you are given rational explanations as to what is actually going on - that fear of water that Dunn has is really only a psychological reaction to something that happened to him as a kid.Then we have this rather enigmatic character, Elija Price, who seems to sit silent in his wheelchair for most of the film. Apparently he suffers from a degenerative bone disease that means that even the slightest pressure will cause them to break. Yet, what is his super powers? Well, it is never actually explained, with maybe the suggestion that he is actually hyper-intelligent.In a way this film is in part one of those films about beings who walk among us, even going as far as suggesting that comic books may actually be modern records of these super powerful beings. Yet there is also a sense of disbelief in the whole affair, or at least an attempt to make it appear that this may not be the case. However, the problem that arises is that we know that they has superpowers, for want of a better way of describing them. As such, it does make it a little difficult to really get caught up in the 'what it is are they' aspect of the film. Maybe it was just that I was really wanting them to actually be superheroes.The problem with the film though is that it is pretty slow going, but once again that is because of the nature of the film. However, since I spent most of the film expecting them to actually be who they said they were, the whole nature of the film was sort of lost on me. Maybe I should actually go back and watch Unbreakable, which apparently Elijah Price and David Dunn also appear in, which makes me wonder why there wasn't any real recognition when both were in the room together.",Glass

As an auteur superhero film combining two other films, it has a unique style and premise that wouldn't be found in any other film. It is definitely a distinct viewing experience due to its creativity. As the title suggests, this film is really about the final member of the trio, the mastermind Mr. Glass. The other two characters The Overseer/David Dunn and The Beast/Kevin Wendell Crumb are really just there as part of his plan. This can be both good and bad. We see more of Mr. Glass and his plans beyond the terrorist attacks of the first film, but it almost seems dismissive of the other two characters. Their endings are very anticlimactic considering how much they were hyped up. There were other big flaws as well - too much of the film is dedicated to slow ""therapy"" sessions, the conspiracy came out of nowhere and the security in the complex was bafflingly incompetent.

41,tomgillespie2002,Underwhelming closure to an unexpected cinematic universe,5,19 April 2019,"When M. Night Shyamalan's Split came out three years ago, I doubt anybody was expecting what appeared to be a relatively low-key kidnap thriller to eventually reveal itself as a supervillain origin story of sorts, as well as a sequel to the director's finest film, Unbreakable, released a whopping 16 years previous. Despite its flaws, Split was a success with audiences, and it seemed that Shyamalan's reputation - relegated to near-joke status following a string of utter stinkers like Lady in the Water, The Happening and The Last Airbender - was starting to claw its way back to the dizzy heights of his early career, when he was dubbed the next Steven Spielberg after scaring audiences with The Sixth Sense and, to a lesser degree, Signs. Shyamalan doesn't do middle-of-the-road. He's either at the top of his game or testing our patience, but Glass, the inevitable third instalment of this 19-years-in-the-making trilogy, may be the first time he's dabbled with both extremes.Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy), the abusive victim whose 23 other personalities serve to protect him, is still at large. His activities have led to the press dubbing him 'The Horde', and he is currently holed up with four young cheerleaders, the next potential victims of his cannibalistic hunger and his most feared personality of all, the hulking 'Beast'. Meanwhile, super-strong David Dunn (Bruce Willis) juggles his time between running a security business with his son Joseph (an all-grown-up Spencer Treat Clark), and fighting crime.On top of being damn near indestructible, David - named 'The Overseer' by fans of his work - can also sniff out crime by mere touch, and a chance encounter with Crumb leads him to an abandoned warehouse, where the girls wait bound and terrified. The two superhumans slug it out, but before one can outmatch the other, they are set on by a SWAT team directed by the unnervingly mild-mannered psychologist Dr. Ellie Staple (Sarah Paulson). She specialises in cases in which the patient believes they are a comic-book character, and takes David and Kevin to a grungy institution where an old friend awaits them.The old friend, of course, is Samuel L. Jackon's Elijah Price, aka Mr. Glass, named after the rare brittle-bone disease from which he suffers. Split is still fresh in the memory, but if - like me - you haven't seen Unbreakable since it was released 19 years ago, it may take a while to fill in the blanks, because Shyamalan isn't willing to refresh your memory. Glass was an intriguing (and surprising) foe for David last time around, but would a man who is simply more intelligent than most really be lumped into the same category as a man who can survive a train crash and another who can scale bare walls? Nevertheless, the actors are all on top form, with Willis' gruff, underplayed performance finding a nice balance with McAvoy's manic character-switching, and when he isn't being laboured with exposition, Jackson has fun as the guy who is always one step ahead.The strength of the performances makes it seem as though all of the movie's budget went into paying the actors to up their game, as it's difficult to judge where else it was spent. The first two-thirds builds an intriguing atmosphere, despite spending too much time pondering the question of what it would be like if superheroes really existed (doesn't every superhero film tackle this in one form or another?). Shyamalan blows it in the last act, delivering an underwhelming showdown that will leave audiences wondering what the hell the writer/director was thinking. It won't have many calling for more from this unexpected cinematic universe, but it's certainly worth a gamble.",Glass
42,cruise01,James McAvoy's performance was great but Shyamalan's film suffers from lacking thrills and boring direction.,4,19 January 2019,"Glass (2 out of 5 stars).Glass is a terrible excuse for M. Night Shyamalan to put his stamp on a superhero genre. Most of his films are poorly done with a twist that goes sideways from making it a decent movie to a terrible one. Glass being the third film in the entry of Unbreakable and Split. Unbreakable is a slow burn film about David (Bruce Willis) surviving a train crash and realizing he cannot be broken. While Glass (Samuel L. Jackson) was born with a genetic defect that causes him to easily break a bone if he softly hits the ground. While Split was one of M. Night Shyamalan's better film that could have been better if it was a stand alone about Kevin (James McAvoy) who has 23 personality disorders and kidnap's young girls to feed the beast who transforms him into a super strong killer. Glass is a terrible conclusion to the trilogy if you can even call it a well developed trilogy of films. M. Night Shyamalan's script and direction is at his laziest, the plot is boring, it lacks any thrills or suspense, and characters are written to be stupid.It is hard to give away details about the plot without going into spoiler territory. It follows David (Bruce Willis) who is a vigilante known as the overseer and fights crime. While, Kevin (James McAvoy) is back at his maniac self of kidnapping girls to feed the beast. David rescues those girls and fights with the beast. But they both get captured by Dr. Ellie (Sarah Paulson) who wants to evaluate the beast and David. At the mental institution, they also come across another patient known as Glass (Samuel L. Jackson).The only positive thing about the movie is the first act with David going on a rescuing spree of beating up criminals and coming across the beast. It had its thrills and excitement. After they get captured by Dr. Ellie. The film falls so far below, it is never getting back up for the next two hours. The second act drags on for a long time with Dr. Ellie evaluating David, Kevin, and Glass. Lots of dull conversations that slows the pace down. The climatic third act is even worst when David is facing against the beast. Characters makes stupid decisions. Even the hero makes terrible choices. The script and direction also makes the security guards and police officers to be dump when they see a threat and they do nothing. Really? The twist in the end was just flat out boring and disappointing. M. Night Shyamalan is clearly out of ideas on how to conclude the trilogy and the ending to the movie. You cannot even call this a grounded superhero film.The best thing about the movie besides the exciting opening first act. The cast James McAvoy, Bruce Willis, and Samuel L. Jackson were good. Anya Taylor-Joy was good as well with a minor role this time. And Sarah Paulson is talented but her character was the worst addition to the film. And the music score West Dylan Thordson was probably the best thing about the film. The ticking clock sound tries to build some suspense.Overall, Glass is a bad film. The opening act, cast ensemble, and music score was not enough to save the film. M. Night Shyamalan missed his mark on this film with a lazy script and a boring direction.",Glass
43,Floated2,Quite underwhelming,5,15 November 2019,"After being surprised by how enjoyable and thrilling Split was, and seeing how it connected to Unbreakable in the end (also being a fan of Unbreakable), there was a lot of overall hype surrounding this film- Glass. Did not think it lived up to the hype, as it was a major step down from Split, and also Unbreakable. The tone isn't as mysterious, gratifying or engaging as Split. And it feels somewhat long and boring in its first hour or so.The film has great camera angles and is well show, and the uses of colors do stand out but as a plot, there isn't too much of intrigue. It gets started off quite slow, gets a little better and its ending isn't quite as strong. Glass is watchable but as a whole is really quite underwhelming and not that great. The critics were more so right about this film than the audiences. Whom most praise for the film comes from James McAvoy's performance, which is understandable as he is great but this time around, it isn't as fresh (as we have already seen it). Sarah Paulson's character was a negative as she was annoying and took up too much screentime. Too much talk, not enough action. In all, a lot of the film the three main characters of McAvoy, Bruce Willis, and Samuel L. Jackson felt caged up in the psychiatric prison institute.Also the ending twist is somewhat confusing but as predictable, but when it occurs, it wasn't something that completely shook and took a turn for the greater. We were waiting for something and overall it was slightly disappointing and felt forced.",Glass
44,eddie_baggins,Pointless but filled with some great scenes,6,20 January 2019,"The conclusion (?) of one of the most unlikely and unexpected of shared movie universes makes its way onto our screens in the form of M. Night Shyamalan's Glass, the melting pot of ideas that started 19 year's ago with the oft derided directors under-appreciated sophomore feature Unbreakable from 2000.Following up his return to form and smash hit Split, Glass follows directly on from the turn of events in Shyamalan's James McAvoy dominated thriller and while not all is successful in the filmmakers often too self-indulgent outing, this far-fetched yet entertaining affair should please fans of this particular world created by the divisive talent.Bringing together Samuel L. Jackson's scheming and intelligent Elijah Glass, Bruce Willis's nigh on indestructible David Dunn and McAvoy's Kevin Wendell Crumb (among a collection of other's) in a loony bin coordinated by Sarah Paulson's mysterious Dr. Staple, Glass is a character driven piece that explores the possibility of real-life superheros and villains, with a dabbling of beast oriented carnage thrown in for good measure.Those not overly familiar with past occurrences may find themselves growing quickly tired of Glass's rather slowly paced and methodical approach to its material, inspired by Shyamalan's love of comics and his desire to create his own heroic landscape but fans of past event's will lap up the chance to see the three lead actor's together on screen.The shared scenes between the A-list performer's is unquestionably the films strongest asset with Willis the best his been in some time and Jackson doing his usual solid shtick but much like Split before it, McAvoy elevates everything around him quite substantially as he laps up the chance to run wild with the many personas of Crumb.If it weren't for the fact Glass is very much a genre film and made entirely for pulpy audience enjoyment, McAvoy's multiple performances would garner a substantial and well-deserved collection of plaudits and whenever his given a chance to run riot, Glass is a seriously entertaining and crazy ride.The ride Glass takes however is halted in its tracks as it's third act begins, an act that feels both like an anti-climax and an event that explodes with a fizz rather than a bang.It feels as though Shyamalan didn't have the means at his disposal to deliver what seems to be coming or that perhaps he was unsure of how the slow build to the films finale was going to get done in a way that ties many of the plot lines together and for a director that found fame with how his film's often conclude, Glass finds itself lost in its last waltz, making what has come before it feel somewhat underwhelming.Final Say -There's fun to be had here thanks to the performers (especially when McAvoy is given the limelight) and fans of the previous installments will find much to enjoy yet while Glass doesn't shatter what has come before, it also doesn't do enough to feel totally warranted.3 carnival rides out of 5",Glass

46,leonblackwood,Big let down but McAvoy smashed it! 4/10,4,21 May 2019,"Review:
After the success of Split and Unbreakable, I had high hopes for this film, especially as the whole cast was returning, but once again, it turned out to be a total disappointment. The movie is based in a mental institution, which was a bad idea from the get-go because you don't get to see the 3 main characters, David Dunn (Bruce Willis), Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) and the Beast (James McAvoy), use their unique powers until the very end. Although it's called Glass, it's mainly about the Beast in my eyes because Elijah plays dumb for most of the movie, and David is locked up in a room, playing the ""Good Samaritan"" who gets treated like the enemy. After an hour and a half of boring psychoanalysis, and the beast constantly changing from one character to another, I got fed up with the film, and the ending was appalling. Samuel L. played his usual type of role, where he is superior to others, but James McAvoy was excellent throughout. Without his character, the movie would have been much worse because Bruce Willis looked like he didn't want to be in the film. All of the action scenes which involved Willis, were really weird because you could see that he was struggling to play the role convincingly. As I had watched Split and Unbreakable, the whole Mental Institution concept seemed pointless because I already knew about there powers and what they were capable of. Towards the end, the director finally woke up and started to add some complex elements, which didn't make any sense to me, but by that time it was way too late. It seemed like he did a tribute to the Usual Suspects, in terms of the way that Dr. Ellie Staple (Sarah Paulson) pieced together the whole suicide plot at the end, but there were way too many holes in the script and I was left feeling that it was a total waste of a great cast. Personally, I thought that we were going to get an in-depth look into Elijah's character as we did with Unbreakable for David and the different personalities of McAvoy's characters in Split, but we ended up with pointless hospital jargon about comic book heroes and fake superhumans. On the plus side, the beast was pretty scary, and his physique was a drastic change from the usual size of McAvoy, but this film really didn't live up to its expectations. If they do decide to gather other superhumans for another movie, I really hope that the director gets back his spark because his last few movies, except for Split, haven't been that great. Average!Round-Up:
This movie was written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, who also brought you Praying for Anger in 1992, Wide Awake, The Sixth Sense, Unbreakable, Signs, The Village, Lady in the Water, The Happening, The Last Airbender, After Earth, The Visit, and Split. His career has certainly had its ups and downs, and he's worked with some top actors when they were in there prime, but his complex storylines sometimes leave the audience baffled and confused. After creating 3 brilliant characters, who brought different elements to make a perfect movie franchise, I don't know how he made a shambles of the whole thing. He had already done the hard work by giving all of the characters an in-depth back story, which was why it was weird that he didn't give Glass his own standalone movie, and then made a 4th movie about all three characters together. Anyway, judging by the box office takings, it's obvious that the public has grown to like these characters, which was why they rushed to the cinema to see them all together on the big screen, but after reading the critics reviews, it certainly didn't go out with a bang.Budget: $20million

47,TheMovieDiorama,Glass surprisingly does not shatter into tiny shards of stupidity.,6,21 January 2019,"Well, this may just be one of the most conflicting films I've watched for quite some time. For everything Shyamalan executes correctly, he also manages to mess something up. Much like Glass himself, he has written an over-meticulous, overwrought and occasionally divisive story. And yet there I was, slowly perking up after slumping in my chair. It was happening. I unashamedly admitted to myself, I was actually enjoying a Shyamalan film. Not since 'Unbreakable' have I truly liked one of his films ('The Visit' has been his closest). Yet, including all of the problems this thriller has (and there are loads), I liked it. Set after 'Unbreakable' and 'Split', David is on the search for Kevin so that he can save some abducted girls. They both get caught by an organisation that deals with individuals deluding themselves with the thought that they are superheroes. And of course who is locked up with them? Elijah. ""First name mister, last name Glass"".This concluding chapter of an unplanned trilogy attempts to incorporate elements from the surprise hit 'Split' and the cult classic 'Unbreakable', by merging the characters from the former with the latter and maintaining the genre deconstruction from the latter. And for the most part it works. Frustratingly I found 'Split' to be average, and because of its success Shyamalan focused much of the story on Kevin (or ""The Horde"" now) and left David completely underused and Elijah waiting on the sideline until the third act. For us 'Unbreakable' fans, that was an underwhelming move. Family members and previous victims questionably return for character development and backstory, which is not necessarily a negative but acts as one of the many plot conveniences scattered throughout. However, I cannot criticise the film. I just can't! No matter how ludicrous these conveniences were, no matter how absurd the ""mastermind's"" plan was, it all makes sense given the parameters that Shyamalan has set. You could simply say that every action that takes place is ""all part of the plan"", and you wouldn't be wrong. It is near impossible to criticise the plot. But then you go deeper than that. Bad dialogue? Just a construct of early superhero comic books. Cheesy reveals? Again, a typical narrative structure that many in the same genre utilise. Just got ""Shyamalan'd (twice!)? ""All part of the plan"" I'm afraid. It's strangely clever, I mean is it an act of genius or just pure luck? Regardless, how far can we go to make comprises for this thriller? There is a underlying sense that something just isn't clicking together properly, and I think it's just down to the lack of balance.McAvoy gives yet another excellent performance(s) with Shyamalan executing some nice one take shots to allow him to change personalities and show off his talent. I did find that ""The Beast"" was no longer menacing in comparison to 'Split', mostly because he had so much time in the spotlight. Jackson was good in yet another comic book film, although was overacting with his eyes (we get it, you're the villain). Willis was severely underused. Paulson was an enigma for me. Her character was so boring and clinical, yet I felt there was substance to her motives. The real star for me was Shyamalan who used his creativity to create some intriguing shots. Y'know some nice details like tilting the camera when in Elijah's brittle perspective. His acting though? Please stop. ""Let the man walk, jeez!"". The musical score was also noteworthy, accompanying some decent scenes of grandeur especially when David retrieves his rain poncho and wedding ring. Simple, but powerful.The film could've concluded atleast three times, and Shyamalan did shoot himself in the foot occasionally. Divisive is an understatement, however I thought it was necessary. In the end, despite all the negatives, I kind of loved this? I mean I don't even know anymore! It's not the new 'Unbreakable' but it's a step up from 'Split'. I suspect the rating will change upon a rewatch.",Glass
48,damianphelps,In case of boredom...break glass,8,6 September 2020,"Good entertainer, intriguing and rewarding.Most facets of the movie flow together well to provide an enjoyable tale that pieces together the trilogy nicely.I loved all four of the main characters but obviously the kudos belongs to McAvoy. As with Split his performance is brilliant and I think its somewhat of a shame we don't get to enjoy more of the horde instead of a couple of lines from each member. Often I watch a movie and see the actor more than the character (this happens with Tom Cruise for example, for me) but with McAvoy you have to see the characters, you never see him.First class movie and I'll be interested to see what, if anything, happens next within this particular universe.",Glass
49,matthewssilverhammer,A Noble Ending to an Unlikely Trilogy,7,25 January 2019,"The movie-going audience has a bipolar relationship with Shyamalan. Once proclaimed ""the next Spielberg"", he then went through a string of big budget failures, before making a resurgence in the past few years. Through all his highs-and-lows, Shyamalan has always made ambitious films, and Glass is no different. Here in his finale to his superhuman trilogy he does for superhero movies what Scream did for horror, lovingly recognizing its genre tendencies as benchmarks instead of clichés. It's not quite as clever or urgent as it could be, but Glass, like a good comic book, still manages to strike an appropriate balance between admitted absurdity and unashamed sincerity.
Following cult hits Unbreakable and Split, Glass finds Jackson's titular mastermind once again (what else?) masterminding another bit of real-life comic book lore, pitting Willis's hero against McAvoy's villain. It's a great tonal combination of the two previous films, though leaning heavier on the psychological superhero drama of Unbreakable. All about trauma, identity control and cultural elitism, it has as much intriguing philosophizing as it does action. By the end, it borders on being a Shyamalan mess, but its ambitions are too noble to write-off.
What really makes Glass fly are the performances, especially from the central figures. Willis is fine, but McAvoy and Jackson are remarkable. Jackson is laying on just the right amount of ham to show that he's having fun, while underlaying it with plenty of care, and McAvoy is like a magician, pulling off each internal character nearly simultaneously with equal parts comedy, pathos and horror. Some questionable story logic must be set aside, but I think it's worth it for a superhero movie this abnormally bold.",Glass
50,marmar-69780,glass,4,17 December 2019,"Glass is for some people satisfaying conclusion to the end of franchise,but honestly i was expecting more from it,for my taste it has little dynamic effect between three leads and to little time to spend on them together instead we got far less intersting plot with secret groups and their entire twist in the end that didnt work so much for me,glass is dissapointing compared to unbreakable and even to split and fails to demonstrate epic conclusion that easily could if it was overall better made and with better plot and story convinced on screen",Glass
51,southdavid,Glass Slip-up,6,24 January 2019,"M Night Shyamalan reunites the cast of two of his former films for a sequel that I found enjoyable, and yet somehow still a bit disappointing.With the news of ""The Beast"" (James McAvoy) kidnapping and killing girls across Philadelphia dominating the evening headlines, David Dunn (Bruce Willis) and his son Joseph (Spencer Treat Clarke) are trying whatever leads they can to track him down. When they eventually do cross paths, their showdown is interrupted by Dr Ellie Staple (Sarah Paulson) and a large team of well-armed police. Staple takes them both to a secure psychiatric ward to convince them that their superhero manifestations are all in their minds, but the hospital has another patient, who though catatonic, has close ties with Dunn.As with ""Split"" James McAvoy's performance is wonderful, the way he can switch characters mid-scene and portray the differences between them is mesmerising. So it does feel make me feel bad to say that I wish that ""Glass"" had concentrated a little less on Kevin and ""The Horde"" and a little more on David Dunn and what he has been up to since the events of ""Unbreakable"". I think perhaps it's just that ""Split"" was only a couple of years ago and ""Unbreakable"" was nearly two decades hence but that was where I'd hoped the film would focus.As I said in my review of ""Unbreakable"" Shyamalan is a very gifted technical director and shot selection and cinematography are again excellent. Again though, perhaps it's his desire to throw a twist in at the end lets the film down a little. Without speaking about it specifically, it's not really layered into the story enough. Watching the film a second time, I don't think that the clues are there, that you'll be able to logically see it coming. (Although whilst watching the film, with a gut feeling and nothing else I was heading along the right lines).Whilst I quite liked the film that's there, I did come away a little .... short changed maybe, that despite the clashes between ""The Beast"" and ""The Overseer"" (as Dunn's character is named) we don't get that definitive clash between the two of them. I can't help but feel like I want to see more from these characters, or perhaps this universe - though I think from the way Shyamalan is talking, this is the conclusion.",Glass
52,jtindahouse,Overall a disappointing conclusion to a wonderful trilogy,6,20 January 2019,"I'm a huge fan of the first two films in this trilogy. 'Unbreakbale' is one of my favourite movies of all time, and 'Split' is a very well made film with one of the best endings I've ever witnessed. So needless to say I had been eagerly awaiting 'Glass' and had high hopes for it. Unfortunately I would have to call it a let-down overall. It was a very different film to what I was expecting and it didn't hit the notes that I had hoped it would.The main problem I had was with the story structure they chose to use. The entire first half of the film felt wasted to me. There was some interesting dialogue and you could tell that it was setting everything up for the second half of the film, but when you take that long to go about things the pay-off better be bloody incredible. M. Night Shyamalan is more than capable of delivering that pay-off, but on this occasion I felt he got it wrong.The conclusion was all very strangely done in my opinion. We were promised something big and spectacular only to find out that that was a ruse. Instead we are treated to a messy car park battle. It all just felt very underwhelming for the conclusion of an amazing trilogy. Also the sloppiness with which it was done was beneath Shyamalan's standards. It felt extremely amateurish at times with choppy cuts between characters and a real lack of overall focus.To end the negatives and get into some positives I'll just add that the movie is called 'Glass' and yet that particular characters is absent for a large portion of the film (at least in terms of being any worth to the story). His mental absence is explained later, but it still feels like a great character was wasted. Finally I think Shyamalan didn't handle juggling so many characters very well. He seemed hard pressed to give them all enough screen time and because they were all basically on their own for the majority of the film the choppy editing back and forth between the characters was a distraction.At this point you probably think I hate the film with a passion. I don't - I just didn't love it as much as I hoped to. Mostly I just wanted to get the negatives out of the way first. The best thing this movie had going for it was probably James McAvoy's performance and character. Every time he's on screen he steals your attention and is impossible to look away from. He never once has a weak scene (maybe his parking lot scene would be considered slightly weaker than the rest at a stretch) and without him I don't think this film would be as popular as it's possibly going to be.Even though Shyamalan wasn't in his best form with 'Glass' there are still little moments of magic from him. Little stylistic ideas that only he could create. Otherwise though the project all feels a little rushed. Maybe with some more time he could have tidied up the edges and ironed out the creases. This is the film we got though and while it's not terrible I would suggest that people just lower their standards before going in slightly.",Glass
53,jamesrupert2014,"Weak, derivative ending to an otherwise promising trilogy",6,22 March 2020,"M. Night Shyamalan's three alleged meta-humans (fragile genius Elijah Price/Mr. Glass (Samuel L Jackson), reluctant hero David Dunn/The Overseer (Bruce Willis), and one-man crowd Kevin Wendell Crumb/The Horde (James McAvoy) are incarcerated together by psychologist Ellie Staple (Sarah Paulson) who is attempting to prove to them that they do not have 'super-powers'. Comic-book obsessed Glass, wanting to publically demonstrate that meta-humans do exist, tries to set up a traditional final-episode confrontation between the Overseer and the Horde for the world to see. The movie takes the clever premises from 2000's 'Unbreakable' (that by engineering disasters, you could identify meta-humans amongst the survivors) and 2016's 'Split' (multiple personalities could be biologically distinct and include manifestations with meta-human abilities) and drags them into a derivative and implausible 'secret society' story. In general the cast is good: Willis is fine (albeit a bit bland) as the laconic Dunn, Jackson is very good as the unique character Dr. Glass and McAvoy is again excellent playing the rapidly toggling personalities of 'The Horde' (amazingly, he manages to make the potentially gimmicky role both authentic and menacing). The first ~80% of the film is quite good, as the scene is set for the inevitable showdown but then it goes off the rails when Shyamalan reveals his trademark 'twist ending'. The whole premise that there is some kind of 'secret organisation' that has, for millennia, been supressing meta-humans and that has the power to insert its operatives in hospitals, police forces etc. seems ridiculous (and more-of-the-same, the movie and TV worlds are full of secret 'Men in Black'-like organisations with seemingly unlimited influence fighting demons, supervillains, aliens, etc). The film also has an odd anachronistic feel: Mr. Glass' elaborate plot is to have the two meta-humans fight on the grounds of the hospital because there are hundreds of cameras that he can hijack and stream evidentiary images to the world, but these days if he had taken them to the building inauguration (his decoy plan) there would have been tens of thousands of cameras, all independent of anything Staple and crew could do to stop the dissemination of images. Shyamalan has stated that there will be no further sequels, which is good, as the (real) world does not need yet another paranormal-battling 'secret organisation' franchise.",Glass

But I must to say some going into this, If you are expecting a superhero film like Marvel or DC, then you will be disappointed, but if go in this expecting an M. Night Shyamalan film with some surprises, then ya'll probably enjoy it more.
A worthy follow up, Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson get back in there roles perfectly, almost feels like they never left. James McAvoy chews up every scenery he's in, showing a great range of his talent, able to jump for one personality to another. Sarah Paulson is good here, has the doctor who thinks there crazy. Lets not forget Spencer Treat Clark and Ana Taylor Joy. Has great action and great suspence.",Glass
55,dfranzen70,Easily shattered.,3,18 April 2019,"Glass is ineptly paced and written, with broadly drawn supporting characters, too-obvious motives leading to a predictable ""twist,"" a lack of suspense, and virtually no payoff. As the sequel to both Unbreakable and Split that really no one asked for, Glass feels forced from start to finish, as if Shyamalan is desperately trying to convince his audience that the interconnectedness of the three films is important or interesting. The performances onscreen are pretty good, from Willis, Jackson, and McAvoy, although the movie probably would have been vastly improved with a stronger female lead. The supporting characters played by Anya Taylor-Joy, Spencer Treat Clark, and Charlayne Woodard, are placed in hopelessly contrived situations, behaving merely as vectors to move the story along. The plot feels as if it was written by a middle-school class, and not one of the advanced classes, either. This movie veers from being amazingly boring to plain idiotic. No, I did not like this movie.",Glass

This is the third of a trilogy, the first being Unbreakable from 2000 and the second being Split from 2016. It helps considerably if you have seen the first two. All three were directed by M. Night Shyamalan. Some people are fans of his work-I am-and some are not. I really liked Glass and think it's a good movie, but it is a tad slow in parts. The story is good and has the usual M. Night twist ending-it's better if you do not know much about it prior to viewing it because it's a goody-and M. Night has a small cameo role. James and his 23 personalities is on a kidnapping spree-his latest involves 4 cheerleaders being held hostage in an abandoned warehouse-and Bruce spends his down time looking to rescue them. Sarah shows up and captures both James and Bruce in the middle of a battle royale and take them to a hospital for observation-she is a psychologist. Samuel is already there, under treatment. Sarah knows their history with the super hero fascination and tells them they are just delusional. FYI: You do get to learn what caused James to have all those different identities. Anya, being the only person to have escaped James-from Split-shows up wanting to help and maybe get some kind of closure. This is a comic book movie but it's grounded more in the real world. The only thing resembling a costume would be Bruce's rain coat with a hood.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, bloody images and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 9 minutes.
You will either like it or be confused by it-that's why it really helps to see the other two movies first-but I enjoyed it and would buy it on Blu-Ray.",Glass

58,alindsay-al,A Great conclusion to this unexpected trilogy,8,22 January 2019,"I recently watched Unbreakable and Split again and I really enjoyed them so I was really excited to see the conclusion Glass and I was relieved because I believe that this film delivered on the hype and was a great film. The premise of the film sees David Dunn on the hunt for the individual called 'The Horde' which leads him to meet his old enemy Mr Glass. James McCavoy plays The Horde in this film and is absolutley amazing in this film, the way he switches between the personalities is pretty brilliant to watch and captivating to see and even a level above the great work he did in Split. Bruce Willis is back as David Dunn and you can tell he does care about this character, he delivers a strong performance befitting of the character and perfromed very well. Samuel L Jackson returns as Elijah Price AKA Mr Glass and he really gives everythingto this role, he takes his time to get going but he really thrives in this role and it really helps return him to the mainstream. The supporting cast also does a great job, Sarah Poulson plays a doctor and she adds alot to her role and becomes an interesting character to watch on screen. Anya Taylor Joy reprises her role from Split and she does a decent job with the work she has given. The story of the film is interesting to see these three characters interact with each other and deal with their dynamics. Also like most M Night Shamylan films there is a big twist in this film, but there are a few different twists in this film and I thought the majority of them worked even with quite a controversial ending. However, I feel like the way the story is structured David Dunn isn't actually in the film that much which takes away from the gimmick of being a true Unbreakable sequel. The script is great with some great dramatic scenes and also some well placed humour which added some much needed levity to the film. The style of the film has a great feel to it in this world with more comic books they take advantage of it successfully. Unfortunatley though with the few action scenes in the film, I felt they were pretty poorly filmed and made it seem a bit silly and like it was clearly stunt doubles. Overall this is a unique great sequel that if you are a fan of the previous films needs to be seen.",Glass
59,henry8-3,Glass,5,17 December 2019,"Willis, McEvoy and Jackson are taken to to a secure facility to persuade them that they are not the superheroes they think they are as laid out in previous films Unbreakable and Split.Interesting and actually largely restrained insight into the 3 characters. Willis is his usual cool, restrained self, Jackson, the real menace, wide eyes and pent up to take the lead and McEvoy, the real nut who is actually more convincing here that in Split.It's fine up to a point and the characters are fun to watch, but it builds to a rather disjointed unsatisfactory climax where the 3 characters never really come together in any way. Watchable, but a bit disappointing given what it could have been.",Glass

61,sauravjoshi85,A Decent farewell to the Trilogy but climax could've been much better.,7,31 May 2021,"Glass is an action thriller film written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan and stars James McAvoy, Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Sarah Paulson, Anya Taylor-Joy, Spencer Treat Clark and Charlayne Woodard.The movie is third and final installment of Unbreakable trilogy.Before watching this movie i would like to request you all to please watch Unbreakable and Split in order to understand this movie and without watching any of these movie it would be difficult for you to understand the characters.The movie undoubtedly a good movie and a decent farewell to what have been a great trilogy, there are certain dissatisfaction regarding the end of the movie and i would also like to raise my voice in that favour that the end of the movie could've been better.The plot of the movie is good and execution is somewhat great as the movie is been successful in keeping the the interest and curiosity of the viewers afloat, the screenplay of the movie is gripping and will keep you guessing about the outcome after almost every scene.The acting is decently average to good with James McAvoy again reprising his role with utmost perfection and intensity. Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson were also impressive and in my opinion they were underutilized and had deserved much more screen-space, If they would've been given decent screen-space the movie could've been more better and probably different. Sarah Paulson was average and Anya Taylor-Joy looked confused and ineffective. Spencer Treat Clark and Charlayne Woodard were effective in their limited screen-space.The climax of the movie is the main spoiler of the entire movie as i was expecting some great climax but is disappointed, Entirely the movie is not disappointing and but the climax spoils the show still the movie is a decent end to the Trilogy and a good watch. I am not able to understand why is there so much hate for this movie?",Glass
62,kirbylee70-599-526179,TRIPLE THREAT,10,21 May 2019,"Director M. Night Shyamalan is technically a great film director. Couple that with his ability to concoct an original story complete with an ending you rarely if ever see coming and it makes him one of the best around. With GLASS the question is can he take three movies and bring them all together into a cohesive story? The answer is absolutely.If you missed the earlier films go back and watch them starting with UNBREAKABLE from 2000. In that film Bruce Willis stars as David Dunn who discovers he is invulnerable and can sense evil when he touches someone as well as having an arch enemy in the form of Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson). Shyamalan followed that film up in 2016 with SPLIT in which we are introduced to James McAvoy as...well numerous characters. His character possesses several personalities the most frightening of which is the Beast, a serial killer. At the end of that film just before the credits we got a glimpse of Willis as Dunn and word quickly spread that this was a trilogy.Now we have GLASS. All three characters come together in a unique and fascinating way. The film opens with Dunn now roaming the streets in search of the Beast who's been killing women still. Dunn's son Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark who actually played the same role in UNBREAKABLE in 2000) helps him as well as keeping tabs on their security business. As he's about to return home Dunn bumps into McAvoy and realizes who he is. Tracking him down and facing off against the Beast both are surprised when a task force shows up and captures them.The task force is led by Dr. Ellie Staple (Sarah Paulson), a psychiatrist who works specifically with patients who believe they are super heroes. Each of the three is held captive in a special location with different safeguards to prevent them from escaping. For Dunn it is his ""kryptonite"", water that hoses him down daily. For McAvoy is flashing lights that force him to change personalities. And with Price he is now in a catatonic state in a wheelchair unable to speak.Dr. Staple works with the threesome as she tries to convince them that their beliefs are nothing more than in their minds. Physically they are no different than any other person on earth. Which makes the viewer wonder, were we actually seeing them perform the feats we saw in the previous films or were we just believing they could do what they did?Along the way Joseph continues to search for a way to free his father. At the same time the sole survivor of the Beast's attack, Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy), is called in by Dr. Staple to talk to McAvoy. She does so but is left with more questions than answers. She checks out comics, the source for these three's behavior according to Price in the first film, and learns more about them there. At the same time Joseph does some digging and discovers a secret as well.Elijah Price isn't seen until 20-30 minutes into the film and silent for quite a bit of that time. But since his character is also known as Glass (his super villain name because of a disease that makes his bones brittle and easily breakable) he has to have a larger part than one would think. The evil mastermind that is Glass comes out eventually and plans the escape of all three.I could provide more but I don't want to ruin the surprises that Shyamalan has developed for the viewer here. Suffice to say that you might think you know what's coming but by the end you'll still end up surprised. And in addition to that while nothing has been said the distinct possibility of yet more films in the UNBREAKABLE universe are a possibility.The acting here is amazing. It's the best performance from Willis in some time, especially since he's made a career change of starring in low budget action flicks these days. Jackson as the evil manipulating, posturing mastermind does his usual standout job. But as with SPLIT it is McAvoy who takes the cake here giving multiple performances in one person. Each of the characters that inhabit the body he owns has their own way of behaving and that's amazing to watch.I'd read lackluster reviews for this film before watching and I'm not sure why. Perhaps it was because the two previous films moved at a faster pace and had more action. But for me this film was still a joy to watch and tied up all three films perfectly. It's one that I know I'll watch again alongside the other two and would recommend for your viewing as well.",Glass
63,juneebuggy,James McAvoy is fantastic,4,6 November 2019,"Didn't get this at all. I guess Glass is not a stand alone movie, I guess you must have seen other two (Unbreakable and Split) -although I'm now in no hurry to watch those. I never really figured out what was going on here, James McAvoy and his 'horde' are brilliant is about all I can say. Oh and M. Night Shyamalan directed.",Glass
64,kluseba,Like a chocolate pudding turning out to be dog feces,7,21 February 2019,"Glass starts like an intriguing supernatural thriller with bleak atmosphere as three men with mysterious powers encounter at a mental institution. The movie is a contiunuation of Unbreakable and Split, hence completing a trilogy that had started quite promisingly. The acting performances by a resilient and tough Bruce Willis, a highly diversified James McAvoy and a gloomily intellectual Samuel L. Jackson are absolutely outstanding. The settings are also quite intriguing as the mental institution has a vibe of insanity, isolation and secrecy. The camera work is calm and precise, amplifying an almost claustrophobic atmosphere.As the movie progresses however, it loses some of its atmosphere, creativity and wit as the film turns from a psychological thriller into an action film where the fascinating three main characters are degraded to superheroes that could come straight out of the uninspired, repetitive and stereotypical Marvel universe. The movie progressively loses its identity and even the usual twist that occurs in Shyamalan's clever films is too predictable to leave a mark. The viewers gets fed entertaining but shallow popcorn cinema by the end.The movie starts like a rich meal at a steakhouse to turn into Kentucky Fried Chicken fast food by the end. The exposition of the movie is brilliant, the rising action is promising leading to a tense climax but the falling action is disappointing and the resolution simply uninteresting. The film will have commercial success since people prefer empty superhero flicks over Shyamalan's more intellectual works. However, more sophisticated cinephiles will feel let down. It feels as if Shyamalan tried to jump the bandwagon midway through the film. It isn't surprising that he wants to experience commercial success after his unique films like The Happening have been harshly criticized by people who are unable to think outside the box. But as a fan of his works, the outcome of Glass is disappointing, especially since its premise had been so promising. Since the first two thirds of the film are still great, the movie deserves an overall solid rating by mathematical laws but the final third feels like a huge failure to me. It makes sense to watch the film if you have watched Unbreakable and Split but if you haven't, do yourself a favour and refrain from watching this to avoid popcorn cinema disappointment.",Glass
65,Kdosda_Hegen,Most underrated movie of decade.,9,9 April 2020,"Firstly those casuals Marvel fans couldn't even understand that this is not a Marvel movie... Superhero movie is not always mindless hero vs villain crap, you know. Sometimes it's a serious drama. In this case, this is almost the perfect sequel to Unbreakable and Split. The whole character study and build up to the end was the best I could have ever ask for. And they even made a fight scene at the end, so those mindless casuals could not cry themselves of boredom. Anyway that fight scene was so much better than I expected, I was impressed, it was awesome. After it, sadly movie dropped balls, the ending is quite insulting to the franchise. They killed all 3 heroes like nothing. I don't mind if they died, but they died the cheapest and worst way imaginable, that was a huge let down. And then the predictable plot twist which in real life would not change anything at all. I mean so what that they published the fight scenes, people will think it's just a fan made superhero movie or video or whatever. Everyone will think that it's just special effects and not real. But still, even with crappy ending everything else was pure perfection, definitely 10/10. Sadly I have do decrease the rating for ending.",Glass
66,Pairic,"This film will delight, confound and annoy!",8,20 January 2019,"Glass: The third in a trilogy which began with Unbreakable, continued in Split and now reaches it's conclusion(?) in Glass. This film constructs a new narrative of Superheroes and Supervillains only to simultaneously anatomize that chronicle. David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is happy to be a low-rent Superhero, beating up petty crooks but when out on one of his ""walks"" he literally bumps into Kevin Crumb (James McAvoy). Crumb has abducted four cheerleaders and Dunn fights him to save them. Far from being pleased with Dunn the authorities consign him to a psychiatric hospital along with Crumb. The special asylum wing has a third occupant, Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), the brittle boned super-intelligent villain who has brooded there for years. Dr. Ellie Staple (Sarah Paulson), believes that the trio are suffering from Superhero Syndrome and wants to break them from this delusion, she believes that their supposed enhanced powers can be explained away by the use of sleight of hand and people seeing what they wanted to see. She is determined to cure themSo the game commences, Price believes that people with super powers have always existed and that narrative has been related through fairytales and folklore and in modern day comics. Indeed Dunn's son Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark) has an epiphany in a comic book store which allows him to finally understand what is really happening. Casey Cooke (Anya Taylor-Joy), kidnapped by Crumb in Split, undergoes a similar experience and shows that she is no longer a victim. Shyamalan exploits the public's fascination with comic book characters to suggest that their powers are a creation of the awe and acclamation of those very multitudes.Shyamalan can't seem to make up his mind whether he is being light hearted or serious, do you laugh or shiver at how Price introduces himself? Can Dunn's raincape which results in him being called The Green Guardian or The Overseer be anything other than a joke? This film is a strange mixture of The X-Men, One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest with touches of Dan Brown and even a homage to King Kong. While the battles in Glass may pale in comparison to those in The Avengers they are powerful nonetheless as they involve the clash of Archetypes. Written and directed by M.

In this outing, we have Bruce Willis' character at peace w/his rain parka'd superhero out roaming the streets of Philly righting wrongs committed on the innocent. When a quartet of cheerleaders turn up missing, Willis, along w/his son (Spencer Treat Clark nicely returning to a role he originated) via surveillance earpiece, track them down to the warehouse district where James McAvoy's multi-personality serial killer confronts him. Once the showdown gets underway, all of a sudden a cadre of police surround the pair capturing & placing them in a mental hospital where an earnest psychologist (played by Sarah Paulson) tries to convince them they're powers comes from a brain abnormality & not a natural state of evolution. Things gets interesting when Mr. Glass (Samuel L. Jackson) himself turns out to be in the hospital as well which leads the film into the 'really, he went there' category when it enters a realm of introducing an overarching entity that runs all things placing our superhero/villain trio in jeopardy. Not as bad as Night's prior string of turkeys, this feels of a piece w/his last few efforts but this one's story didn't get cracked satisfyingly giving the audience the grudge match they wanted but served under the auspices of Night's annoying twists which this story didn't deserve.",Glass
69,aidanratesmovies,"McAvoy Shines in a very interesting, but somewhat uneven film",9,4 May 2019,"By far one of the most interesting films of the year, Glass shines greatest when it embraces the sole weirdness that made it shine in the first place. The script can be a bit messy at times, but in the end you are left with strong impacts from all that it has brought down, and you can't help but like it for that. James McAvoy is fantastic again as Kevin Wendell Crumb, and in fact may be even better the second time around, as we get to expand into the mind of the character and go further than ever before, and McAvoy never lets down with it. Samuel L. Jackson is good, for the time he is in the film, which is mainly the second half. Bruce Willis' part, unfairly, is obviously the weakest part of the film, mainly do to the script showing insecurities the most when it comes to his part of the story. However, Willis still is able to bring us to care for his character in more ways than one, and tries his best with what he is given. Sarah Paulson is also unexpectedly good in a very interesting role that may not seem like much at first, but like the film itself, grows into something greater as it grows on. All in all, Glass is by far not a bad film. It can be messy at times, dialogue isn't always the best, and out of the many twists some don't quite feel right. However, McAvoy saves the film largely by giving us one of the most unique performances of the year, and the film itself provides for a very unique and intriguing experience, that is bound to capture your attention whether you like it or not.

70,TheFearmakers,Glass Lacks More Than Action,3,12 February 2019,"M. Night Shyamalan never needs to provide a director commentary track for GLASS since the actors do it for him.

Night Shyamalan's conclusion to the story he began in 2000's Unbreakable is really good until it's much derided final moments (they're too short to call an act), but I'll get to that later.As it stands, the first four-fifths of the film is quite strong. David Dunn occupies the focus of the first act as he searches for The Beast three weeks after the events of Split. He searches different areas of Philadelphia for the man who is feeding off of young girls, using his power of vision through touch to try and narrow the search area down. The fight that ensues is perhaps a little closely filmed, but tension filled and exciting. The sudden end to it, when Doctor Staple shows up is jarring, though. However, I wasn't ready to dismiss the movie because it had made a move that I wasn't really expecting.The largest major section of the film occupies the psychiatric hospital of Raven Hill where Dr. Staple tries to convince Dunn, The Beast (and the Horde) that occupies the abused man Kevin's body, and the long in keeping Elijah that they are suffering from a delusion of grandeur. It is Staple's priority to convince these three that they are mere human and should give up their beliefs in their power.And here's where I think the intellectual heart of the movie resides. The Beast and The Horde talk about belief. They speak of making the masses believe and of how the members of the Horde are losing belief in The Beast and his way. Elijah, once he begins speaking halfway through the movie and take on the moniker Mr. Glass, talks about the three believing in their own abilities. And all the while, Dr. Staple is trying to get them to explicitly not believe in the same thing. Dunn is caught in between. He, and certain members of the Horde, begin to waver in their belief in their extraordinary selves.In many ways, this central idea reminds me of The Incredibles and Syndrome's plan to make everyone special, undermining the specialness of those who actually are special. Glass and The Incredibles could act as a pair of sister films to watch side by side. The Incredibles, though, is more successful on a basic narrative point of view, but I do think that Glass explores the central idea in a more interesting way. As Dunn doubts his own abilities over time and only rediscovers himself through the necessity to fight The Beast.One element of the film that's received some derision is the buildup of the idea of the Osaka Tower and the great fight that will come. However, I think that buying into that premise is the audience missing the point of Glass's philosophy. It's not that comic books are real, but that they are born from events that then get blown up into something else. Superman couldn't fly in the beginning Casey reminds Dr. Staple at one point. So, what we end up getting is the beginning of belief, the extraordinary feats of extraordinary people, far removed from the spotlight of a huge crowd. The final fight takes place in a parking lot in much the same way that, if Glass's philosophy is correct, the inspiration for Superman lifting the car on the front of Action Comics #1 must have. It wouldn't have been with millions of eyes on him, but with a small crowd.And that's the origins of belief. To take this in an explicitly religious direction for a quick moment, it wasn't a multitude that witness Jesus' transfiguration or resurrection, but a handful of believers who went on to spread the word from there. It's an interesting idea, explored in an interesting fashion, and told well.Until that ending, though. I don't hate the final ten minutes of the movie. It's competent and sort of makes sense. The problem is the basic plot elements of the super secret anti-superhero society are so poorly established early that to turn the final moments of the film into a cathartic ending around that, instead of our actual main characters, feels incongruous at best. It's like Shyamalan wanted to both open the door for sequels and not leave too much of a cliffhanger at the same time. I think it would have worked better if they had left out the bit about the videos going viral, and just ended with the videos showing up in our three supporting characters' email inboxes.Still, I think the movie isn't really getting a fair shake. The dialogue isn't great, sharing a wordiness that's both unnatural and perfectly in line with everything Shyamalan has ever written, but it's well acted, looks good, and has a very interesting take on its central idea. It's something I want to see again, not because I think I missed something, but because, now that I think I understand what he was going for, I could probably appreciate it more.",Glass
77,TheOneThatYouWanted,Negative reviewers are totally wrong,10,15 September 2020,"Yeah, my boy M Night Shyamalan nails it again! Such a smart way to conclude or explain the 'Unbreakable' world, if he chooses to build upon it later and so on. Let us be honest here, 'Unbreakable' should have been a stand alone film but when he came out with 'Split' then 'Unbreakable' sequels became fair game. Would I have liked 'Unbreakable' to have been a stand alone film? Heck yeah. But because this is now a universe, you must review this film based on that new working. And he put out a great film and tied-up all the loose ends. What more do you want?",Glass
78,jadepietro,Another Disappointment,4,21 October 2019,"GRADE: C-THIS FILM IS NOT RECOMMENDED.IN BRIEF: Not much makes sense in this well-made supernatural thriller.JIM'S REVIEW: M Night Shyamalan digs up his past in his latest supernatural offering Glass. He stitches together his Frankenstein cinematic monster by returning to two of his former box office successes, Unstoppable and Split, in hopes of creating a third. But there is no lighting in a bottle here. Everything fizzles in the third chapter of this trilogy.The plot: Vigilante David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is fighting criminal evil in the form of multiple personality killer, The Beast, aka Kevin / Patricia / etc. (a still impressive James McAvoy) when they are brought together with evil mastermind, Elijah (Samuel L. Jackson), by a sinister Dr. Ellie Staple (Sarah Paulson) who specializes in mind control techniques. Havoc, of course, ensues.The screenplay by Mr. Shyamalan wallows in convolution and confusion. It also unites these super anti-heroes's families and victims into this complicit situations that never make any logical sense, especially Casey (Anya Taylor-Joy) who, for some unknown reason, now pities her former abductor and torturer. This all leads to a belabored sequence of events that become preposterous, although conspiracy theories and fanboys may enjoy the complications. I didn't and found my moviegoing experience to be disappointing due to the movie's far-fetched and completely unsatisfying ending.Glass may be a well crafted film but it is all too fragile when it comes to logic. The first cut may be the deepest, but the third is just plain dull.",Glass

Some certainly have become more famous due to their stinkers than their successes, and tonight one of those directors tries again to make a win in his library. Hitting the surprise third film of the expanded universe, yours truly hits the latest thriller to get some points into the beginning of the year. My review tonight is on the epic finish to the movie made in 2000, as I feature:Director:
M. Night Shyamalan
Writers:
M. Night Shyamalan, M. Night Shyamalan (characters)
Stars:
Anya Taylor-Joy, James McAvoy, Sarah PaulsonLIKES:Consistent With Universe
Same Atmosphere
Decent Fight Scenes
Writing
ActingSummary: A trilogy sometimes loses the feeling established by its predecessors. Glass though, keeps in theme with the universe, going back to its roots and making sure to incorporate the past into the present. In doing so, the story sticks to its themes, accounts for the changes, and provides an atmosphere that feels much like Unbreakable film, at least in terms of the darker tones. As such, fans of the series can at least get into the promised psychological premise the film had to offer. A concern I had was cheesy fighting that we glimpsed into the trailers, but again surprised that Glass had fight scenes that again agreed with the tone of the film. Not too grandiose, but also not lame to not be needed.
Yet, while the atmosphere and tone of the universe was welcomed, the writing surprised me in terms of the dialogue. Glass has enough psychological mind games, mastermind planning, and comedy integration to please a variety of people. Balancing the comedy into the field and not forcing it led to some well time guffaws, that were quickly drowned by further dives into the dark world of battle of the minds. Yet, the lines are really brought out by the acting. The leaders for this round are McAvoy and Paulson. The former transitions into his personalities beautifully, and sells the D.I.D presentation to the letter in all its grandiosity and humor. Paulson on the other hand sort of brings her creepy, intensity to the world, adding a little mystery to the plot at hand. As for Willis and Jackson, they play their roles well, but the tyrants of the first installment didn't quite have the same presence as they once did, with the exception of a few scenes. The verdict is they play their parts well, but not quite as integrated as I wanted.DISLIKES:Pace
Losing the Heroic Feel
A Little More Suspense Needed
Integration Of The Characters
Some Editing
Summary: Glass may keep much of the atmosphere of the first film, but it kept the pace for me as well. Much like many of Shyamalan's works, Glass sort of slogs along after the first twenty minutes to open up to a lot of talking and a little less survival aspect. As stated, it's a little more down they psychological tunnel, and this does not open up to the most engaging premise if you aren't willing to pay attention. As such, the movie is missing some of the suspense and intensity both films had prior to it. By missing the suspense, the over 2 hour run time feels a little boring, a few moments open to editing to lighten the load and assist with getting to the more exciting components.
In addition, I do agree that the film missed that heroic component that the first installment had. Certainly a different take based on Elijah's goals, Glass finishes the trilogy in the style worthy of the mad genius' name. While I think it works well, the film fails to do the Unbreakable character justice, and by missing that heroic qualm I felt missed an opportunity to cover the major motion spectrum. Still I do give props to the twist ending.
In regards to my biggest area to improve on, it's the character utilization. As stated in the acting section for my likes, Glass managed to do well with some of the characters, but the kings of the 2000 film I don't think had quite the sting we were waiting for. I was hoping for all three of the commercial characters to remain equally integrated, a bout of cat and mouse as the wits go against the strengths of the duo. Even the, non-super characters needed a little more incorporating to feel integrated, with the ending sort of giving them the justice they deserve, but again not used in the way I was expecting him to go.
The VERDICT:Glass is a movie that still holds the psychological thriller the last two have held in their presentations. Shyamalan has once again managed to write an installment fitting the universe, and did a nice job incorporating the mindset of the infamous of Mr. Glass. Yet, the pace doesn't quite match the intensity of Split, and without that it feels a little slow and off put compared to those that came before. In addition, the characters were inconsistent for me and given the direction the film took, not the conclusion I expected though still somewhat satisfying. I'd say worth a trip to the theater, but not quite the film to shatter the glass ceiling like it was promoted.
My Scores are:Drama/Mystery/Sci-Fi: 7.5
Movie overall: 6.5",Glass
81,burlesonjesse5,VIEWS ON FILM review of Glass,4,24 January 2019,"""We almost got you bro"". So says James McAvoy's Hedwig in 2019's Glass (my latest review). Glass the movie, well it didn't quite ""get"" me either. With an overwrought narrative, weird camera angles, a lack of terror/suspense, and some shoddy Spielbergian interludes, M. Night Shyamalan directs the film like a poker player with way too many hands. Sadly, he comes up with a metaphoric, busted straight.Anyway, Glass is a mumbo jumbo sequel to Unbreakable and 2016's Split. It involves the characters from those flicks (David Dunn, Hedwig, Elijah Price) being locked in a mental hospital with a psychiatrist trying to prove that they aren't formidable superheroes.Bruce Willis reprises his role as Dunn and sorta phones it in. Samuel L. Jackson and McAvoy are reliably solid as Price and Hedwig. As for the part of psychiatrist Dr. Ellie Staple, well Floridian Sarah Paulson comes off as awkward and incredibly annoying. It doesn't help that Shyamalan insists on shooting her in amateurish, close-up fashion. Oh and I almost forgot, M. Night also makes another look-at-me cameo in Glass. Like many of his other Hitchcock-wannabee cameos, it's pretty forgettable.Harboring a paltry, $20 million dollar budget (it shows), feeling completely different than your typical superhero endeavor (I'm talking Marvel and DC Comics), and containing an obligatory Shyamalan spill ending that reeks of being run out, Glass again shows M. Night Shyamalan at his most pretentious and most la-di-da. This movie is multi-layered, pat, and hooey-ed, with every supporting player acting as if this is the first time they've ever been in front of a camera. While watching the prolix, dark-hued Glass, I felt underwhelmed, under embellished and at times bored. Yeah, Glass is a cinematic ""bypass"".Bottom line: The Sixth Sense and Split are the only flicks I would consider to be Shyamalan masterpieces (Unbreakable upon multiple viewings, is serviceable). Glass unfortunately falls into The Happening territory (ugh). It's not completely ""broken"" but it sure seems ""see through"". My rating: 1 and a half stars.",Glass
82,rannynm,"Unique Twist On Superhero Movies With Lots Of Comedy, Action And Drama.",10,17 January 2019,"The film Glass is breathtaking! This unique film is such a great combination of comedy, action and drama and that's what makes it unique and different. I didn't want to look away during any part of the film, because every second you feel like you want to know more. The way each story is laid out is outstanding. Each character is so unique and all have their own strengths and weaknesses. The film is so extraordinary that you think you have powers.The storyline is about three people who have amazing gifts that are so unbelievable that they start to believe they are more then just a person with amazing gifts. Then, a doctor finds out about them and takes them in because she doesn't believe that they have extraordinary gifts. She believes they just have mental disabilities from accidents that happened to each of them during their lives. She tries repeatedly to make them believe that they are all normal with a disability, until they decide to do something insane to show her that they are not just a normal people and are special. This film will surely bring chills, smiles, laughter and maybe even tears to those who watch it.The main characters are: James McAvoy (Kevin W. Crumb/The Beast/Patricia/Barry/Etc), Bruce Willis (David Dunn), Samuel L. Jackson (Elijah Price/Mr. Glass), Sarah Paulson (Dr. Ellie Staple), Spencer Treat Clark (Joseph Dunn) Anya Taylor Joy (Casey Cooke), Charalayne Woodard (Elijah's Mother). These actors truly make you believe their characters are real and keep you on the edge of your seat with their performances.My favorite part is when Anya Joy (as Casey) speaks to Kevin Crumb who has split personalities - good and bad. During this conversation, Casey talks to all of Kevin's various personalities and the love she shows somehow fights off the other personalities. It is heartfelt to watch this scene because it shows how important their friendship is.The message of this film is that we are all special. All we need to do is express ourselves and not hide. Another message is that it doesn't matter if other people believe in you. As long as you believe in yourself, anything is possible.I rate this film 4 out of 5 stars and recommend it for ages 12 to 18, including adults. I truly believe that many who watch this film will really enjoy it.Reviewed by Nancy F., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, visit kidsfirst dot org.",Glass
83,rannynm,A breathtakingly unique twist on the classic superhero movie.,10,18 February 2019,"Glass kept me at the edge of my seat the whole time! This film takes the viewer on a rollercoaster of twists and turns. It's very well done with exceptional acting, which is what I like most about it. James McAvoy, Ana Taylor-Joy, Bruce Willis, Sarah Paulson, Samuel L. Jackson all make you feel as if you are inside the movie, living all the intense moments they go through as your own. M. Night Shyamalan's direction is outstanding. Everything is so well set up and all the questions are answered at the end of the film, giving it a suspense that keeps the audience engaged.Glass is a mixture of narratives of two of standout originals, Unbreakable from Touchstone and Split from Universal in a new comic-book thriller. From Unbreakable, Bruce Willis comes back as David Dunn and Samuel L. Jackson as Elijah Price or Mr. Glass. From Split comes James McAvoy, replaying his role as Kevin Wendell Crumb and the multiple identities that reside within and Anya Taylor-Joy as Casey Cooke, the only survivor from the Beast. Following the conclusion of Split, Glass finds Dunn pursuing Crumb's superhuman figure of The Beast in several events, while the manifestation of Price appears as a mastermind that holds secrets critical to both men. Definitely this concludes the series in an unexpected, yet impressive way.My favorite part is when Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy) switches and acts like his multiple personalities when he is first taken into the mental hospital. For anyone that has seen Split, you get to relive how funny his impressions of the distinct personalities are and remember how much you enjoy them. The whole plot is so tense throughout, that it is good to have moments like these to breathe a little bit before the film goes back to more serious moments of the story.This is a very entertaining film that perhaps reminds us not to be friends with psychopaths. I recommend it to ages 14 to 18, plus adults and rate it 5 out of 5 stars.Reviewed by Alejandra G., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic. For more reviews by youth, visit kidsfirst dot org.",Glass

85,vengeance20,"No better than Split, but ok",5,22 January 2019,"I know many are going to think I'm just agreeing with the critics, but I can tell you now, I'm not! This is an honest review from an honest film goer! So don't confuse my half negative review for one of the many critics, I'm truly being honest here & have a right to think whatever without being judged & misinterpreted. It's important to note everyone on here is different & those who dislike or give low ratings for this film aren't all because of what the critics say, I go by my own opinion when watching & reviewing a film.Also to just say this, I never even knew Split was a sequel to another film, it's no wonder as 1, the first film came out 17 years before Split & 2 we're in the last year of the decade of the 2010's. Unbreakable is nearly 20 years old & I only knew of the film when stumbling onto the Wiki page for this film I'm reviewing!So with that my opinion on this film is this, I thought it was ok. Not amazing, but ok. I seen split 2 years before & thought the same, but Split had a higher rating which I think the critics got all wrong due to the fact that I didn't think it lived up to it's hype. This films got negative reviews, yet I can't help but agree as I partially thought the same way, this again isn't me just agreeing for the sake of it, I generally agreed partially what the critics thought. The film did feel underwhelming, I didn't feel moved by it & felt disappointed & confused by the end.So having not seen Unbreakable & now only seeing Both Split & this film, Glass. I sort of roughly knew what this film is going to be like. But like many others I had no idea Unbreakable existed, even before seeing Split I had heard absolutely zilch about it, which kind of shows its popularity & how deflating these sequels are which are the only reason as to why Unbreakable even gets noticed. It almost seems to have been forgotten.But there were good points in this film & some interesting parts also. So it wasn't all bad, but it sadly wasn't good enough. But it was watchable is not a bit long for what it is. I did feel the ending was underwhelming & I truly felt that from viewing.Overall 5/10",Glass
86,moviexclusive,"Fascinatingly intriguing and immensely satisfying, this psychological thriller that both deconstructs and reinvents superhero mythology is one of M. Night Shyamalan's best",8,17 January 2019,"Far more than being a gripping psychological horror, 'Split' will best remembered for its shocking final moments, which revealed it to be a standalone sequel to its writer-director M. Night Shyamalan's 2000 superhero drama 'Unbreakable'. Those moments had therefore also set the stage for his latest film, named after the remaining member of the triumvirate yet to have a movie in his reference.But frankly, if you didn't already know that, you'll likely find 'Glass' confusing, even frustrating - unlike the last two movies of his interconnected trilogy, this is intended as continuation of both storylines, and Shyamalan makes no apologies for not restating the context leading up to the meeting of these three unique personalities.At the risk of stating the obvious, these are: Bruce Willis' David Dunn, the so-called 'unbreakable' human who discovered that he possessed superhuman strength and invulnerability; James McAvoy's Kevin Wendell Crumb, a serial kidnapper with dissociative identity disorder and a couple dozen 'split' personalities, including a murderous one known as 'The Beast'; and last but not least Samuel L. Jackson's Elijah Price, a devotee of comics literature whose struggle with his rare genetic disorder of osteogenesis imperfecta (i.e. his bones break easily, like 'glass') has made him convinced that his place in life is to be the very antithesis of superheroes.Through the engineering of psychiatrist Dr. Ellie Staple (Sarah Paulson), they find themselves imprisoned at the same institute for the criminally insane. According to Dr. Staple, she has three days to cure what she terms their 'delusions of grandeur', failing which they will be trialled and probably put away for life.Much of the movie therefore takes place within the confines of the hospital where our three leads are locked away, with a good first hour at least spent watching Dr. Staple's therapy sessions with them. Though the routine isn't as fresh as before, there's no denying that watching McAvoy shift abruptly from one persona to another continues to be fascinating, especially how they respond to Dr. Staple's therapy. In comparison, Willis' David remains largely subdued, as if both sceptical and hopeful that Dr. Staple will put things right with Kevin; on the other hand, Jackson's Elijah appears to have regressed into a catatonic state, showing little expression beyond twitching his facial muscles.But there is good reason why the movie is titled after Jackson's character, so you really should not be surprised when Elijah snaps out of his stupor to put the finishing touches on his nefarious plan. Oh yes, like he revealed at the end of 'Unbreakable', Elijah is a master manipulator with his own designs for the world. Whereas his string of terrorist acts were intended in 'Unbreakable' at proving the existence of those who were indestructible, Elijah now wants the world to see that superheroes and arch-villains do exist, and sets out to free both David and Kevin so they can duke it out in public.If you know Shyamalan, you'll know better than to expect that things are as simple or straightforward than they first seem, so rest assured that we haven't at all spoiled the movie for you; in fact, we'll even let you know that there are at least two or three major twists in the second half of the movie alone, leading up to a shocking conclusion that all but sets the stage for an exciting new chapter.Lest you recoil at the very notion of Shyamalan's so-called 'twist ending', we'd say this - before he turned his own technique into a laughable gimmick, it did actually stand for something, and this one here is as good as that in 'Signs' or even 'The Sixth Sense'. At his best, Shyamalan has proven himself to be a master storyteller, and 'Glass' finds him at his world-building best.Like 'Unbreakable', 'Glass' finds him deconstructing superhero mythology through Elijah's obsession with comic book lore; yet beyond drawing parallels between the characters and classic superhero archetypes, his most intriguing conceit here is that of pain as a form of cleansing that opens the door for those who are ""broken"" to acquire superhuman powers. Sure, the dialogue may tend towards the pedantic at times, but Shyamalan's singular vision and view of the superhero construct is unmistakably bold and fascinating to behold.It is also brought to fruition by a trio of excellent actors that highlight their characters' contrasting nature with alacrity. Call it showboating if you want, but it is no small feat making a showstopper of each one of 23 different personalities - including a nurturing older woman named Patricia, a lisping eternal 9-year-old boy named Hedwig, a pair of Irish twins and even a pompous professor of Japanese cinema - and that is what McAvoy does. Whereas Kevin is violent and unstable, David is strong and sceptical, and Willis continues to underplay the role as he did in 'Unbreakable'. And then of course there is Jackson, who is deliciously sinister as the delicate but deadly Elijah, a more fully formed villain than most of those in the Marvel or DC movies so far.Much as we were wowed by 'Glass', we'd be naïve not to recognise that there'll be those who think it pretentiously meta. Lovers or haters aside, Shyamalan has always been a divisive filmmaker, and this is no different. In part, we were half fearing a bomb like 'After Earth' or 'The Happening' after the deluge of negative critic reviews, so we were pleasantly surprised by how brilliantly clever and original it turned out to be.We'd also caution you not to expect a typical superhero movie complete with a grand action-packed climax - not only are there enough Marvel and DC movies for that, 'Glass' was always intended to be more of a psychological thriller. Yet it is precisely this cerebral quality that sets it apart as a truly original piece from an auteur, and we're thrilled to see where Shyamalan takes his universe of world-savers and evil-doers to next.",Glass
87,elliotjeory,Disappointing end to the trilogy,5,22 May 2019,I feel like Glass was a disappointing end to a trilogy that never reaches its full potential. The two films were released too long after unbreakable and James McAvoy looks ridiculous jumping around like a dog.,Glass

(PG-13)Continuation/crossover of the stories previously told in ""Unbreakable"" and ""Split""; here, we get superhumans McAvoy and Willis locked up in the same mental institution as brainy baddie Jackson. Talky and plodding for about an hour after we get the trio in the same location; once things begin percolating, though, Shyamalan starts delivering the ham-fisted twists, which are neither rational nor satisfying. McAvoy amuses when bouncing between his split personalities, though like in ""Split,"" it's a case of more-acting, not good-acting; Jackson doesn't say a word until the second half but eventually gets to be cold and charismatic at the same time (a neat feat), though anytime he starts yammering about literal connections between comic books and real life, it's tough not to groan. Of Shyamalan's many failures here, the most disappointing is that he doesn't allow Willis and Jackson (a good match in ""Unbreakable"") to spar with each other; he even botches that great setup of putting all three of them in the same room with a psychiatrist (Paulson)--the scene simply goes nowhere.36/100",Glass

90,nancyldraper,A World Builder's Masterpiece,8,19 January 2019,"I'm coming at this movie from a different perspective than I usually would. This film is the culmination of unobtrusive trilogy (most of us had no idea we were engaging in a story in three parts until the very last scene of SPLIT). It is in this third piece where M Night Shyamalan earns our respect as a creator of worlds. While we were drawn (or repelled) to UNBREAKABLE or SPLIT as individual entities, Shyamalan was laying out his unique take on the worlds of Super Heroes and Villains. This third film finally reveals his perspective which culminates with his signature twist. As the dialogue frames it - this the realization of a comic book universe hidden in our real world, not a super world. I found his premise very interesting, complex yet simple. Now to the movie, itself: its stellar cast do not disappoint. Bruce Willis, James MacAvoy and Samuel L Jackson perfectly recreate their roles. Sarah Paulson perfectly calibrates her performance which leaves the latitude for the final reveal. Anya Taylor Joy (especially) and Spenser Treat Clark mature their characters and their performance beautifully. This trilogy always pulled to the dark lane, skirting Horror (which I think determined its audience and almost kept me from seeing SPLIT). I gave the first two instalments a 6 out of 10 each, but now, surprised by Shyamalan's greater vision, I give this film an 8.5 (great with some brilliant creativity in its vision) out of 10. {Slow Burning, Dark, Superhero Thriller}",Glass
91,arungeorge13,Not much to dig beyond McAvoy's terrific acting showcase! [+54%],5,19 April 2020,"As a follow-up to Split and Unbreakable, Glass feels like an incomplete yet somewhat middling finale. McAvoy is, once again, brilliant in his portrayal of Kevin Wendell Crumb and his 23 other personalities. We get to The Beast more often here than we saw in Split, and it's safe to say that the lead character in Glass, more than David Dunn or Elijah Price, is Kevin Wendell Crumb. Maybe, that's got more to do with Split being writer-director M. Night Shyamalan's more recent work as compared to the 19-years-prior Unbreakable. In fact, it did feel like a clever ploy on Shyamalan's part to put Kevin, Dunn, and Price in the same universe at the end of Split.Now, the question here is, whether the effort really pays off in Glass. The character arc for David Dunn is the weakest, I must say. He and his son (Spencer Taylor Clark returns as Joseph), run a security systems showroom as a cover for the vigilante work they do (using Dunn's superpower). Elijah Price is put away in the Raven Hill Memorial Mental Institute. An incident brings all the 3 unusual personas to the same facility, under a single roof. Shyamalan's universe-building capabilities were now going to be put to the ultimate test.Dr. Staple (Sarah Paulson) is supposed to be the binding force bringing all of these explosive characters together. Yet, that scene (involving the lead foursome), barring McAvoy's hypnotic display of acting prowess, is the least memorable in the entire film. McAvoy seamlessly hopping from personality to personality (we see a few that we didn't really get to, in Split) is easily the film's unique selling point. Seeing how things play out in Glass, I now wish Kevin Wendell Crumb (and/or The Horde) had been left in a universe of his own. Anya Taylor Joy, who was splendid in Split, is relegated to an extended cameo and her character did not feel as integral to the movie as it should have been (especially, in the climax).As for Willis, it's an okay showing. It definitely isn't his greatest effort; considering how Dunn (even while being the conventional protagonist) is lacking both physical and emotional finesse. Dunn's character closure also felt the most unconvincing, as opposed to Kevin's or Price's. He deserved a more heroic conclusion than what transpires in the film. Maybe, pitting the arch enemies 19 years later against each other and adding The Horde into the mix wasn't such a great idea after all. Also, you'd better have watched Unbreakable and Split - two solid standalone films by themselves - before sitting down to watch Glass. A lot of plot points from those films are brought into question here. Some of the dots do connect without making much of a mess.It's clear that Shyamalan hasn't entirely lost his twisted touch. However, I'd have preferred a Split sequel with David Dunn + Elijah Price cameos instead of Glass.",Glass
92,Abdulxoxo,The last act ruined everything,6,5 February 2021,"The first act is the best section in the movie. It only last 20 or so minutes, but it is exactly the style of movie that was interesting to watch. There's action. There's suspense. There's hope for where this film might build up to. Unfortunately, things would continually go downhill from the point where they get caught. The second act is very dialogue-oriented, which at times was interesting; but sometimes it became quite boring. The way in which Dr Staple tried to convince these characters that they were merely normal humans was fascinating and actually did make sense. Although the expositions became a bit tedious. What made this section stand out was the performance of McAvoy. The way in which he is able to switch between multiple personalities and make each of them so recognisably different is such an impressive skill. The third act belongs to Mr Glass. During the latter stages of the second act we begin to understand that Elijah has had a plan in his head the whole time and was waiting for the perfect opportunity to execute it. During the third act is where we watch on as he attempts to make that plan a reality. This third act is where the movie goes completely off the rails into utter nonsense and criminally misjudged directorial choices. The twist was disappointing. This final act ruined all the good work from the first two acts; and for that matter all the good work from the first two films.",Glass
93,michaeltrivedi,Just Plain Horrible,1,3 October 2019,"I must say Split was actually a pretty good and entertaining movie to watch. I like M. Night Shyamalan. I think his movies have a lot of intrigue and suspense. They may not be the scariest movies around, or the most well made, but they have a certain aura that just makes you feel satisfied at the end. You feel that all the way through. It's comforting.And yet some just fall flat. I would say some of the movies he made outside of the horror genre really sucked. This movie was better than those, but still pretty bad. It actually is probably the worst horror movie he has made.Don't see it. Don't waste you time.",Glass
94,cricket30,This flick's makers could not have chosen a more fitting setting for their . . .,8,1 February 2019,". . . geezer super hero story than Philadelphia, home to ROCKY XXXIV. It gives film goers of a certain demographic the rare thrill of viewing the geriatric caped (or not) crusaders of GLASS pushing their walkers and dragging their oxygen tanks across the Big Screen, echoing the Real Life ""Senior Citizen Discount"" folks' own halting progress through the theater lobby toward the ever-expanding ""handicap seating section"" as the previews were playing. It now seems likely that the self-proclaimed ""Baby Boomers"" will drag their movie-shooting equipment down into their anachronistic tombs when they finally ""go,"" so that they can continue to ""bless"" We People of Tomorrow from ""Beyond the Grave"" (or at least from the ""City of Great-Grandfatherly Love,"" aka, ""Birthplace of Legionnaire's Disease"").

95,Troy_Campbell,Frustratingly weak.,4,23 January 2019,"When M. Night Shyamalan's 2016 Split drew both critical acclaim and commercial success, a sequel was inevitable. Adding to the buzz was a rug-pulling end credits stinger that placed the split-personality thriller in the same universe as Shyamalan's 2000 hit Unbreakable. The first half of Glass plays on the notion of world's colliding to entertaining effect; Bruce Willis' David Dunn (aka ""The Overseer"") hunting down James McAvoy's Kevin Crumb (a serial killer with 24 distinct personalities) in a traditional good-vs-evil showdown. The trio is complete when Dunn and Crumb join Samuel L. Jackson's hyper-intelligent and physically fragile Elijah Price (aka Mr Glass) in a purpose built psychiatric ward, where the enigmatic Dr Ellie Staple (Sarah Paulson) seeks to understand their grandeur of delusions. It's an exciting and interesting first hour in which McAvoy steals the show playing a wide range of enjoyable characters: the buttoned-up Patricia, the childish Hedwig, the flirty Jade and the monstrous Beast to name but a few. Unfortunately the film takes one almighty nosedive at the halfway point and produces an hour of impossibly bad cinema that is at complete odds with the first half of the movie. The plot becomes ridiculously convoluted, winding down a meta-comic-book path that is so cheesy it's unintentionally funny, whilst supporting players - particularly Anya Taylor-Joy's Casey - are given developments that seem to go against character. Disappointingly, the action climax that's built up throughout the entire final act never eventuates as promised, replaced with a sequence (essentially amounting to an underwhelming wrestle) that highlights the low budget. It's also afflicted with the multiple-endings curse, proceedings dragged out unnecessarily as Shyamalan overestimates how much we care about these characters. Distilling his divisive, up-then-down career into a single film, Shymalan's Glass ends up a frustratingly weak affair despite it's relatively strong start.",Glass

97,saptesh786,Disappointing Merger !,6,4 April 2019,"The movie is merger chapter of 'Unbreakable' and 'Split'. If you have already seen those two movies then you will easily enjoy Glass. So as you also feel that it is not justified chapter. When I saw the movie I have many questions like, why lady doctor pick all our superhero at a high tech jail cum mental hospital? Who replace their medicines with alcoholic one? Why they got killed instead of curing them? What is approval for go to next city by lady doctor ? And such superheroes do not show their power in last chapter? Why they died as an ordinary man? I did not find trustworthy answers to them. Some things are gone wrongly here. Otherwise movie will be best one with story of such extra power humans. It seems that movie only made for wrap up those characters forever in a hurry. I really disappointed after. The drama could be taken further away for another trilogy too. Previously 'Unbreakable' was boring and 'Split' was interesting. And this final is disappointing. However acting of various personalities from James McAvoy is superb and deserve for an Oscar award ! Bruce Willis looks old and helpless. Spencer Treat Clark having much acting spark. Anya Taylor-Joy is looking beautiful and mysterious. Sarah Paulson is okay in her Dr. Elie 'role of greedy doctor. Movie is just watchable. But it is injustice to our superhero, Mr. Glass, Mr. Kevin and Mr. David.

I already though he was awesome because I always like him, but Jesus Christ.But other than that, the movie gets super boring, Poulson was PATHETIC as the psychiatrist (really, The Purge levels of pathetic acting). Bruce Willis continued with his ""character"" of non-personality whatsoever, and the great Samuel Jackson was absent for a big portion of the movie.The story ""makes sense"", but contrary to the Split's great use of psychiatry, it's kind of dumb on this one, the characters don't question anything, and there aren't many surprises (and some surprises, I just got them before, so maybe some would enjoy them more).Honestly, probably the worst part of the movie it's the slow writing. Some scenes could've included more information (I don't want to spoil anything), but instead we get little pieces of information and development, and it makes the movie move too slow in the middle, where some rewriting could've taken 10/15 minutes of the middle and make the movie a more fun watch.Another thing: There is little tension during the majority of the movie, which is basically the opposite of Split, which would end up being the best of the trilogy BY FAR.James McAvoy alone worths every penny.

101,aciessi,A Slight Derailment,5,27 January 2019,"The third and final film of the Eastrail 177 Trilogy. Glass is an fun, enjoyable, dopey, psychological thriller. But there is something jarring about combining the Unbreakable universe with Split. Unbreakable is a dark character study about two extraordinary beings who turn out to be superheroes. Split is a dark psycho-comedy about multiple personalities. Riding on the coattails of two remarkable M. Night Shyamalan films, Glass doesn't come forward as remarkable all it's own. You need to see the first two to understand this, and that's a major flaw. Secondly, I wasn't on board with the whole idea that Kevin is in fact a superhero too. Shyamalan, in typical fashion, twists himself into a pretzel in order to make it work. In the end, he successfully pulls it together into something coherent. Will you like it? Yes. Will you remember it? Debatable.",Glass
102,rockman182,Glass (2019),7,22 January 2019,"Its been a while since I've seen Unbreakable but I loved that movie. M. Night Shyamalan may have slipped creatively in more recent times but he was at his peak around the time Unbreakable and The Sixth Sense came out. Split was decent, I wasn't as big on it but admittedly James McAvoy was rather sensational in it. I was very hyped for the last film in this trilogy no one even know would be a trilogy. I've heard bad things but overall I liked the film. The climax will not please many but I think its a grounded realistic look at how superheroes and supervillains would be perceived in the real world.The film is about the battle between David Dunn and Kevin Wendell Crumb (primarily his Beast persona). Both are caught and find themselves in a psychiatric hospital where they are receiving counseling to show them that they are not actually superhuman but rather gifted within the realms of normalcy. Also, Mr. Glass, Dunn's arch-nemesis from Unbreakable, is also housed at the facility. Glass has a nefarious plan that he attempts to put into motion which involves controlling the Beast.Something that impressed me was the return of child actor from Unbreakable, Spencer Treat Clark. Not something you see often with child actors. Anya Taylor-Joy (who I have an Unbreakable crush on) also returns to connect with her former captor. I thought the film has a really incredible build in the beginning and is an interesting concept. The climax is where people will be disappointed as Shyamalan utilizes his twist in the plot and it has serious consequences. Still, I think its a film that somehow unites two films that weren't even similar and binds them into a same universe.This isn't going to blow anyone away but I appreciate what Shyamalan was trying to do with the characters he created decades ago. The acting is fantastic on all fronts. Though I do get lost in the multiple identities of Crumb, McAvoy once again is fantastic and shows great diversity in quick thinking personality switches. This may be a hate it or love it type affair for some. It could have been stronger but I had a good time with it and the message of the perception of superheroes and villains in the world that it portrays.7/10",Glass
103,phanthinga,Find your inner superhero,9,21 January 2019,Glass is my most anticipated movie of the early 2019 after Split make my jaw dropped to the floor with how good it is and the after credit only hype it more and after see it now I'm glad that I went into this movie blind with an open mind cause Glass maybe not many people cup of tea but for me this movie seal the deal of a superhero universe in Shyamalan style. The final showdown in the third arc of the movie can be a big disappointment for fan of flashy CGI fight in the usual superhero movie and I'm totally agree cause after all that built up I think the audience deserve more that just some few punch and extremely close up shot of characters face that get annoyed real quick.

104,Benjamin-M-Weilert,An OK end to a trilogy of loosely connected films.,6,23 March 2019,"Much like Incredibles 2 (2018) felt like a movie that came out far too late, Glass (2019) caps a trilogy of films that technically started with Unbreakable (2000). Both the original Incredibles (2004) and Unbreakable were genre-defining movies for the practically non-existent superhero films that are all but ubiquitous today. The fact that they took more than a decade to capitalize on this phenomenon is part of the reason why both sequels feel somewhat dated. Sure, they recapture a bit of the charm of the originals, but that's not enough to overcome what superhero films have evolved into since then.If anything, Glass owes a debt of gratitude to its predecessor, Split (2016). If it weren't for James McAvoy's expert transitions between a dozen different personalities, I wouldn't have been particularly interested in this final chapter of the trilogy. While Split was a return to form for Shyamalan, Glass seems like a bit of a regression. Perhaps this is due to the heavy burden placed upon Glass to combine two tonally different movies into a cohesive narrative, but the camerawork seemed a little more amateur than usual. Almost as if it wasn't quite sure which film to imitate. It's this kind of multiple personalities of the film itself that ends up shooting itself in the foot.I will admit that the ""twist"" in Glass is relatively satisfying and wholly unexpected. I also appreciated the conclusive nature of this film as well. It's pretty clear there aren't going to be more sequels after this. After all, it's clear that this film about superheroes is trying its hardest not to be a superhero film. In fact, it almost seems bitter that this genre of cinema exploded into what it is today, and it tries to talk down to those who find them to be pure entertainment (and nothing more).An OK end to a trilogy of loosely connected films, I give Glass 3.0 stars out of 5.",Glass
105,RforFilm,Glass makes for a good sequel to Unbreakable and Split...until the ending retcons to tone of both stories,6,28 January 2019,"Time to talk about M. Night Shyamalan again! He is a director who, a lot like many, have many hits and misses through their careers. What makes him unique that along with crafting his own stories and directing them, he's one of the few filmmakers to truly have their own voice. Many of his movies feel like slow burn thrillers and fantasies set in modern day (except for The Last Airbender and After Earth), but also try to focus more on characters and how the situation is affecting them psychologically. I give this guy credit for not changing his style, even when work he produces doesn't always work.I've too made fun of his tropes, whether it's is odd dialogue or an overreliance on the twist of the story. It's not to say he's a bad filmmaker, but it's how the story is ultimately setup. So hence Bruce Willis as a psychologist in the The Sixth Sense worked because of the twist and why a child reading cereal boxes in Lady in the Water for the plot was just stupid. In an interesting twist, we are no getting a sequel to both Unbreakable and Split in Glass, which throws all three main characters together.Nineteen years after Unbreakable, David Dunn (Played by Bruce Willis) has embraced his identity as a protector of people that the newspapers have dubbed ""The Overseer"", with the help of his son Joseph (played by Spencer Trent Clark) who listens on police scanners for local trouble. They trace an area where kidnappings have taken place, which lead him into a warehouse. He helps a group of cheerleaders escape, but comes across their capturer, Kevin Wendell Crumb (played by James McAvoy). They both fight, but are stopped and arrested by the local police who take them to a nearby mental institution.Not only do the two find Elijah (played by Samuel L. Jackson) there as well, but all three of them are being cared for by Dr. Ellie Staple (played by Sarah Paulson). She's come to the conclusion that their belief that their super beings are all part of a delution. Joseph, Elijah's mother (played by Charlayne Woodard), and Casey Cooke (Played by Anya Taylor-Joy) all try to convince Dr. Staple otherwise against treatment, but all fail. Like any superhero at his lowest, David starts to believe he may not be the super human that he thought he was. But like any villain, Elijah has another scheme up his sleeve along with help from Kevin.Glass has a lot to live up to for it's fans that have waited for the sequel. Like a lot of Shyamalan movies, I could see this as polarizing with people wither loving it or hating it. I'm personally somewhere in the middle as the film doesn't always know how to mix all three people into the story. It starts out fine enough by showing how David has changed since Unbreakable, but once he's in the hospital, he's almost left on his own without much to do. Probably because Split was more recent, the focus is on Kevin.The good news is that his scenes, along with Dr. Staple, are actually interesting and kept my interest. It's good to note that also like a lot of Shyamalan movies, the pacing is slow, allowing the cold tone to blossom. This is why that despite the dialogue being a little too exposition-centered, it makes more sense for the sake of the story. As far as things went, I was entranced by what Dr. Staple (played incredibly well) had to say, even though I knew that she was doing more harm. Good writing allows it's audience to sway even if you don't agree with the character.The part that's going to be divisive is the ending. Again, like a lot of Shyamalan stories, the twist either makes or breaks the entire thing. While I'm not judging the decision of how things end, it does end on a note that I wish would have been more in line with the hopefulness of Unbreakable. The conclusion that comes might have worked more before YouTube and social media became a thing, but I could see society not seeing things how the main characters saw.I'll give this five green ponchos out of ten. Glass may not be as good as either Unbreakable and Split, but I still got enjoyment out of it. Its it's ending that left me on a sour note. It just wasn't enough to ruin it for me. It's highly recommended that you watch both Unbreakable and Split first, but it's not completely necessary. Check it out and see if this ending ruins it for you.",Glass

David Dunn(Bruce Willis) uses his special abilities to find Kevin Wendell Crumb(James McAvoy), a man who has dissociative identity disorder(DID).Glass is an awesome movie. Writer-director M. Night Shyamalan has successfully combined the characters of Unbreakable(2000) & Split(2016). I just felt that though the film is good, it didn't live up to my high expectations. That's how superlative Unbreakable(2000) & Split(2016) are. There are one too many plot twists. The performances are the highlight of the movie.

The way McAvoy switches personalities in a matter of seconds, is awe-inspiring. Bruce Willis is brilliant as David Dunn. Samuel L. Jackson is spectacular as Elijah Price. Anya Taylor-Joy is outstanding as Casey Cooke. Sarah Paulson is amazing as Dr. Ellie Staple. Spencer Treat Clark is great as Joseph Dunn. Charlayne Woodard is superb as Mrs. Price.

108,spookyrat1,So Very Underwhelming!,5,31 May 2021,"I'm giving it a 5, pretty much largely because of James McAvoy's truly impressive performance as the gifted/plagued (Take your pick.) multi - personalitied Kevin Crumb. But Glass, the final chapter of M. Night Shyamalan's Unbreakable trilogy is a real disappointment, made even moreso, by the anticipation and buzz created by the clever ending of Split, which served to directly connect it to Unbreakable. Glass is dialogue heavy, ponderously overlong and confirms what many critics and fans have always suspected of Shyamalan; he is incapable of directing an action film, or at the very least, exciting set pieces.Shyamalan does what Marvel did with its TV series Legion. He sets up a scenario whereby ostensible super hero David Dunn (Bruce Willis phoning it in.) is likely to clash with the troubled Crumb's super - powered and extremely aggressive 24th personality, The Beast, as well as his old foe, Elijah Price and then proceeds to suck all the energy and life out of the narrative, by turning it into a wordfest. Just boring! Even the hoped for twist conclusion just drags on and on, well after most of us have already figured out the final outcome.Glass strikes me as a good idea looking for an inviting storyline. But the best writer/director Shyamalan could come up with is a hoary old tale, largely set in an asylum, focused on the extremely unlikely actions of a Nurse Ratched type doctor played competently enough by Sarah Paulson. To pad things out extraneously, we are given threads involving Dunn's son Joe, Price's mom (still kicking) and Anya Taylor-Joy's character Casey from the previous film, who appears to be suffering from an extreme, if not outright unbelievable case of Stockholm Syndrome. Again, nothing caught my imagination, or attracted me to their back stories. Everything was pretty much a yawn.I have to say, I'm really surprised Glass did as well as it did commercially, though it's not spoiling I guess to state that expensive special effects are fairly minimal. In other words, it doesn't have the look of a big budget super hero film. Rather it appears to revel in the fact that it appears to be another middling Shyamalan product, emanating from his Philadelphian abode. It ends up being a major step down from Unbreakable and Split, which remain a couple of Shyamalan's better-conceived films structurally and thematically.",Glass
109,PsychoBeard666,McAvoy deserves all the awards,8,1 June 2019,"Split was an excellent follow up to Unbreakable in which James McAvoy delivered a performance that should've seen him pick up every award going!
Glass is a very good addition to the surprise trilogy of Superhero/Villain films from M. Night Shyamalan that is only let down by a bit of lazy writing. Sarah Paulson should be called Basil Exposition because her character over elaborates for the sake of the audience in ways that just don't feel natural and frankly aren't necessary.
Another minor criticism is that The Beast lost all mystery and intrigue as a character as he was overused and undersold.
James McAvoy was again fantastic and it was nice to see Bruce Willis in a film that he wasn't phoning it in for. Samuel L. Jackson was very good but some of his dialogue felt forced (again, lazy writing).
It's not a spoiler to say there are twists in Shyamalan films but a major one in this felt a little bit tagged on and could have benefitted from a bit more attention.
Overall I really enjoyed this but Unbreakable and Split are far superior films.",Glass
110,MihaiSorinToma,A worthy follow-up which could have done more,8,20 May 2019,"This third act of Shyamalan's universe of extraordinary individuals brings together many characters from ""Split"" and ""Unbreakable"", letting them do precisely what they do best. The plot is quite interesting, taking advantage of the protagonists' skills and building suspense upon them. It keeps the viewer interested at all times, inserting something new from time to time while maintaining the bar up. The characters are the same as in the previous movies, well played by their actors and very enjoyable to watch. The movie also has a couple of twists up its sleeve which it uses with skill and I liked it a lot how it explains every single one of them towards the end.Unfortunately, the conclusion let quite a lot to be desired. Although it comes with its own twist and opens a new world to be discovered, it seems to end a bit abrupt with little satisfaction. The way its main characters are treated is quite disappointing in my opinion. Another downside worth mentioning is the lack of action. Although it is focused on the brainy side of the characters as the title suggests, even when it gets the chance to expose some quality action, it gives the impression that it's shy about it, giving only small hints of what the characters can actually do.Overall, it's a good follow-up to the previously mentioned two, with a good plot and the same great characters, but it left the impression that it could have done more in terms of finale and action.",Glass

Everything in this film is the worst except for the fact that James McAvoy did a good job.

114,Snootz,Another clunker by M.Night,4,18 April 2019,"M's movies are either ""love"" or ""hate"". Loved Unbreakable. Thought The Village and Lady in the Water was pure tripe.While this movie isn't tripe... it misses the target on so many levels. I can't go into it too deeply or we'll get into spoilers. First, the acting was good, the script was good (mostly), the directing was tolerable. But the ""big climax"" was just well... a let-down (to say the least).The best example of this was when ""The Beast"" was running on all fours across the lawn. Shy could have accomplished so much more if he'd just sped the film up a little and had the guy run at the speed an animal would be running. As it is... it looked like nothing so much as a normal man running on all fours across the ground. BOOOORinggg.Most of the film takes place inside a mental hospital... not a whole lot of scenery to intrigue the viewer. The high points were the actors. James' performance far exceeded in quality what he was allowed to do in Split (possibly because he was given significantly more screen time and considerably better script). Samuel reprized his role top-notch. Bruce on the other hand really wasn't given much to work with. It seems he had one expression throughout the film and not given much in the way of glory. Seeing him stand outside in broad daylight in his Security poncho was almost bad-cosplay humorous.In the end the final fight scene was unimpressive and really-- proved nothing. Normal humans have turned over cars before. Normal people have punched their fists through walls or dented metal. Strong men have bent iron bars.In short, the film was quite a let-down... and could have been written/directed much better. The idea was for these men to PROVE they weren't just psychos. If Bruce had thrown a car at the beast, or the beast had crouch-ran at 50 miles per hour-- if they'd have shown some super-genius LOGICAL METHOD Glass used for escaping his room... we might have enjoyed this film much more.Instead what we get is a ""Lady in the Water"" drivel (well, not quite that bad), an anti-climatic fight scene that is underwhelming, a ""proof"" video that's not all that convincing, and a resolution to all three characters that was just plain goofy.Loved Unbreakable. Been looking forward to this film ever since I first heard about it. As it is, I have to say even the extras on the BluRay aren't worth the time watching them; they're even more blase than the film itself.Mediocre. M.Night, you're focusing too much on details of your personal vision-- and not enough on making a good movie. Does Shy listen to feedback from anyone?",Glass
115,kjproulx,"An Earned, Yet Flawed Film",7,18 January 2019,"World-building has become a trend recently, but everyone pretty much knows that by now. Ever since The Avengers hit the big screen back in 2012, everyone has been trying to copy this formula. That being said, it felt fresh when director M. Night Shyamalan put the twist at the end of the film Split, which connected it to the 2000 film Unbreakable. While it was clear that he was taking his idea from what was the most popular thing to do these days, it felt earned, as it was done very well-not feeling forced. Being someone who loves the film Unbreakable and enjoyed Split quite a bit, I had nothing but excitement every time I gazed upon the marketing for Glass, which would combine both storylines and bring them to their climactic finales. While there are many things about this film that will turn viewers off, this is a solid film that I enjoyed watching very much.Following the characters in their current state after the events of their respective films, we find David Dunn (Bruce Willis) on the hunt for ""Kevin"" (James McAvoy), as they're hunted down and captured, only to be placed in the same institution as Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson). These events eventually have each of them interacting at some point, but there is much more going on behind the scenes at this facility. Without getting into too many details, the setup and core story of this film is really the smallest aspect of what director M. Night Shyamalan is trying to get across here. This is where the movie is easily going to lose some viewers from the beginning.Being a sequel, equally to both Split and Unbreakable, it's almost pivotal that you see both films before feasting your eyes on this amalgamation. There are storylines that carry over from both films and revelations that will feel pretty much no impact if you haven't seen both. For this reason alone, I have to dock it a few points for feeling a little disjointed for newcomers. However, there are a few twists towards the end of the film that felt very rewarding for those who have invested themselves in both films and remember key moments. The final act of this film is a little too complex though. There was a lot to like about this film, overall, but I did feel Shyamalan getting a little too full of himself in terms of overly revealing certain things. Other than that, this was quite a pleasant experience.M. Night Shyamalan, no matter how great or how terrible his films have been throughout the years, has always had a great eye for how he wishes his films to look and feel. From the colour grading to the odd (yet unique) choices of cinematography, he is able to put his vision onscreen in a way that many filmmakers have yet to accomplish. Personally, if only he didn't have that long streak of misses, I believe he would've been known as one of the best filmmakers out there. While this is far from his best film, it shows that he still has potential and I'll be in the theatre for his next go.In the end, Glass is a risky film that explores the story of two separate films that came out nearly two decades apart from each other, but is ultimately worth the wait in my opinion. The conclusion does feel a little overstuffed in terms of revelations, but the majority of the film is very well-written, directed, and performed by these actors and actresses. From Bruce Willis giving his most devoted performance in years to the little, yet great screen time that Anya Taylor-Joy receives, I was grinning from ear to ear as I watched these characters onscreen once again. Overall, I would recommend Glass to fans of both films, but I can see this being ridiculed and neglected by some of those who haven't heard of Unbreakable and choose to go into this as a sequel to Split. Glass is a solid film with a few glaring issues, but I had a good time with it.",Glass

Well done, the most unexpected superhero saga of the 2000-2010's. while i watching this movie i was so excited that I feel like I'm gonna jump out of my own skin. one of the best superhero movies. McAvoy his multiple personality acting skills amazes me a lot he is by far, was the best in this movie Simply incredible As far as the movie goes I have to say it's one of the best I've seen this year. Probably one of the most interesting and fascinating stories so touching & real. The critics said it was bad/regular. You know what? They know nothing. Absolutely masterpiece!! What I loved about the fight scenes was it felt like humans fighting, not superheroes.",Glass
118,Carycomic,"I didn't think it was going to be possible. But, this blows ""Aquaman"" out of the water!",10,23 January 2019,"When I first saw UNBREAKABLE (the debut film that made Mr. Shyamalan a household--if barely pronouncable--name), I admit that I wasn't too impressed. Yes, the premise of it involved comic books as a sort of modern mythology (and I admit that I'm a bit of a comic book nerd). Namely; that the emergence of ""super-villains"" catalyze the emergence of their ""superheroic"" opposites...and vice-versa! But, at the time, I still felt that the film as a whole had been a shameful waste of Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson's talents.Yet, it's always being claimed that practice makes perfect. And, as Mr. Shyamalan progressed with other works (such as SIGNS and THE VILLAGE, where he started making Hitchcockian cameos), he got his act together in a progressively good way. Unfortunately, he sort of back-slid with SPLIT, which I still regard as nothing more than a slightly innovative slasher flick. One that I might have upgraded to refreshingly innovative if there had been _more_ than one female survivor (similar to the four cheerleaders in Act I of this film)!He's regained his cinematic footing with this sequel, however.Fellow reviewer Breneff is half-right. This is both a superhero flick _and_ a psychological horror film. Similar to the 1989 BATMAN film with Michael Keaton! And the initial premise of UNBREAKABLE is expanded upon in a rather fascinating way. If moral opposites attract, why have only these three emerged in this particular universe over the last two decades?Answer: because of a secret society bent on maintaining an ordered balance at all costs. Even if it means the whole world remains stagnant! But, everything comes with a price. And, in this universe, the price for an increasingly intolerable stagnation is a proportionate increase in chaos. The only way to battle that chaos? Let the real truth come out. Even if it means morality reverts to clear-cut black-and-white (as opposed to murky gray)!In short: if the moral of this story is that all buried truths inevitably get exhumed--and sometimes sooner rather than later--then, Mr. Shyamalan, I couldn't agree with you more!",Glass

121,anselmdaniel,Decent culmination,6,26 June 2021,"This review contains spoilers.Glass is a psychological superhero movie that premiered in 2019. The movie is a culmination of the two previous movies by M. Night Shyamalan in Unbreakable, and Split. The movie follows the ending of Split as David Dunn goes after Kevin Wendell or the Horde.Glass is not a perfect movie. There are many flaws in this movie. One of those flaws is Bruce Willis' flat performance. In this movie, Bruce Willis did not feel like David Dunn from Unbreakable except in certain scenes. Most of the scenes with David Dunn felt flat from Bruce Willis. Glass did not make it seen as if David Dunn had embarked on his character journey in Unbreakable. This movie made it seem as if David Dunn regressed.The movie is also different and rife with plot holes. The three characters in Kevin Wendell Crumb, David Dunn, and Elijah Prince are taken by a psychiatric hospital. It is revealed later that the head psychiatrist Dr. Ellie Staple is part of an organization that hides the existence of superheroes. This plot development does not make much sense. At this point of the story, the organization already knew that Kevin Wendell Crumb is dangerous and has superpowers. The one that is not known is David Dunn. However this too can be tested. If the goal was to destroy superheroes, then they could have eliminated them. The entire story in the psychiatric hospital was not necessary to the plot.The movie does have good aspects. Samuel L. Jackson returning as Elijah Prince is great. Samuel L. Jackson's performance resembles an aged Elijah Prince and his return makes for good revelations in the plot. The face off between Kevin Wendell Crumb and David Dunn is great. The struggle between these two are portrayed in a cool way that resembles a confrontation in a comic book.I would recommend ""Glass"".Grade: C.",Glass
122,msbreviews,Rating: B+,7,17 January 2019,"If you enjoy reading my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)The first act is seamless. I love how David is introduced 19 years later and how his life is now. Kevin continues to abduct impure teenage girls, and after a few minutes in, we get the first confrontation between our hero and villain. I wasn't expecting an action-heavy film, and I'm glad it isn't because it would ruin the tone of the other movies. This was never intended to be a massive finale with epic CGI fights, like a Marvel or DC installment. If you're one of those people who expected Glass to be an Infinity War-ish film, I don't even know why are you reading this because you have no idea what this trilogy is about.Sarah Paulson portrays Dr. Ellie Staple, and she is responsible for treating people who think they are superheroes. So, the second act revolves around a fascinatingly engaging yet overlong narrative which leaves the main characters (and the audience) doubting if everything they did was a product of their supposedly damaged minds. There is so much to love and hate throughout this act. The interactions between these characters are as captivating as they could be, and I couldn't take my eyes off screen. Then, there's James McAvoy ... I have no words to describe how astonishing his performance is. Portraying one character is hard. Portraying almost 20 characters is just outrageous! However, McAvoy nails each personality delivering himself to his roles in such an unbelievable way. Sometimes I chuckled because I couldn't understand how it was possible an actor being able to do what he did, several times, in one-take sequences.Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson return to portray David and Mr. Glass, respectively. The former is solid, and the respect he has for his character is evident. However, David is sort of left aside in this movie, but I'll get there. SLJ, even with less screentime than the other two, has more to do, regarding moving the plot forward. He gives an extraordinary performance, as expected from such a capable actor. During this act, these four characters offer a lot of memorable scenes, but the narrative is filled with exposition, and it overextends its stay. Shyamalan wanted to show everyone that he knows what he is writing about and a lot of times he used his characters to explicitly say, well, everything the audience needed to know, without any need to.The third act is where everyone is going to either love or hate the film. In this genre, we all know that the ""middle ground"" is non-existent. Either you're part of the group who loves it and you will defend it at all costs, or you're part of the group who hates everything about it just due to its final moments. There is more than one Shyamalan twist during this final act. Truth is, I left a bit disappointed. It doesn't matter what your expectations are, it doesn't matter your preferences, at least one of the twists is always going to upset you. What disappoints me the most is that I don't really love any of them. Unbreakable has a final plot twist that completely changes its whole story, and it comes out of nowhere. It's literally mind-blowing! Split has the 17-year twist of it being part of the former's universe, which made several audiences in festivals give it a stand ovation. Glass has ... a bunch of twists. Period. There are no OH-MY-GOD-like reactions. There are no jaws dropped.Instead, we are left with an arguably questionable decision. A couple of the twists are fine. I would even call them ""good twists"". However, the one that changes everything feels incredibly forced and most of all, it falls short for such a highly-anticipated trilogy's last installment. I can't help but wonder ""is this really the best path you could have chosen Shyamalan? Of all the endings you imagined, this is the one you think is the best to finish a 19-year-in-the-making superhero trilogy?"" Regarding the screenplay and the characters, I have the issue above and one associated with David Dunn. If Split didn't have that final twist, it would be a good thriller. Way above average, but not astounding. The link to Unbreakable's universe is what makes it a standout movie of 2017. So, I was expecting a lot of David, and I only got a small fraction of him.I'll put this way:
if you're expecting an Unbreakable sequel, you'll probably leave disappointed;if you're expecting Split 2, you'll love McAvoy's take on almost 20 distinct personalities, and that alone is worth the price of admission;if you're expecting a formulaic superhero epic finale, filled with massive CGI fights and tremendous visual effects, all wrapped around colossal set pieces, then you are not worthy of even watching Glass, because this means you don't have a clue what this trilogy is about.This is NOT a conventional comic-book trilogy. If you don't know this by now and you're still waiting for that last climax, you're only setting yourself up for disappointment, when no one asked you to anticipate such unrealistic stuff. Never criticize a film for not selling you something it was never even marketed to do (it's like expecting a horror movie to have a romantic happy ending). That said, I left disappointed with its conclusion, but there's still so much to love and praise. Seeing how David accepted who he was and the life journey he took, experiencing Kevin's pain and how each personality was born, understanding what Elijah's purpose is and being blown away by his mastermind plans ... These are characters so well-developed and so well-established that I can forgive some missteps here and there.Before diving into the technical aspects, Anya Taylor-Joy, Spencer Treat Clark (Joseph Dunn) and Charlayne Woodard (Elijah's mother) deserve appreciation for their performances, even if they don't have that much impact in the overall story. Anya has more to do as Casey since her character's bond with Kevin is an explored subplot. Regarding the last two, they only serve as exposition devices which connects to one of my problems with the second act, by not helping the plot move forward in the smoothest way possible.Concerning M. Night Shyamalan filmmaking skills, I barely have anything negative to say. The only minor issue I have is the excessive use of POV in the action scenes (a camera attached to the actor's body which provides a close-up of his face while fighting). Nevertheless, this film is yet another proof of how skillful this guy is behind the camera. There are so many memorable moments where the technique at display is worthy of awards. We will have to wait a few months to find such marvelous cinematography as in this film. Shyamalan and Mike Gioulakis (DP, director of photography) use our characters' respective colors (yellow for Kevin, green for David and purple for Mr. Glass) as the background palette of each scene in glorious fashion. The gradual change in color tells the audience so much about what our characters are going through, elevating one of the best dialogue sequences in the entire movie (the pink room).The editing is sublime, and I love how Shyamalan uses close-ups to show how remarkable his cast is. McAvoy's performance is one of the best this year is going to give us, but part of it is even better due to the camera work. The unfocused background stunt work in a character's close-up is the art of filmmaking at his very best, and Shyamalan knows how to film it beautifully. The score is not as memorable as Unbreakable's, but the sound design is on point. Even with a low budget (compared to the other superhero movies), Shyamalan is able to produce a technical showdown of all his attributes as a sensational filmmaker. And this, my fellow readers, I will defend until the end of his career.All in all, Glass doesn't live up to my extremely high expectations, but it does more than enough for me to enjoy it. I can't help but feel disappointed with the way everything ends and the path that Shyamalan chose, but there's still so much to love. James McAvoy offers you a performance worthy of any price of admission. Watching him portray over 15 characters is something you won't experience maybe ever again. Going through the layers of suspense, disbelief and mystery that the screenplay is structured by is itself an adventure filled with twists and turns which grabbed my attention until the very end.An almost flawless first act delves into an overextended second act where the story lacks consistency and even logic, at times. However, the performances and the main thread of the film keeps everyone enthralled until the polarizing third and final act, where the significant plot twists occur. How can a movie be so fascinating and frustrating at the same time? Shyamalan, ladies and gentlemen. This masterful filmmaker lends all his skills to the film, and technically it's close to perfection. Disappointing? Yes. Frustrating? Yes. Does it ruin the franchise? No, not even close. This isn't The Matrix Revolutions, but it's not Return of the King, as well. It's a good ending to a superhero trilogy that might not be the best of all-time, but it's up there, and it's definitely unique, imaginative and the closest to what our real world would be like if superheroes were a real thing.If you're a comic-book fan, this trilogy is mandatory. If you love Marvel or DC, don't you dare use the word ""grounded"" without watching this saga first. Shyamalan, see you around!",Glass

A far lesser league.It started promising enough and I liked how self-aware it often seemed. I even found myself laughing in odd moments too. It was clear Shyamalan was going for something a little different and that was to be admired - but it just lost the plot entirely. The second half of the film derailed more spectacularly than the train in ""Unbreakable"".Bruce Willis's character (David Dunn) was woefully under-utilised and it sometimes left you wondering why it wasn't just called 'Split 2'. The dialogue itself became woefully dumb by the end. It was almost as if Shyamalan just went nuts trying to create as many twists as possible and totally forgot he was even making a movie.There are no satisfactory endings here and ""Glass"" probably features some of the worst character conclusions of all-time - despite also trying to be an origin story in itself.

128,MrDHWong,An intriguing culmination of two films involving three interconnected characters... for the first two thirds at least,6,17 January 2019,"Glass is the sequel to both Unbreakable and Split, written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan. Starring Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, and James McAvoy, it is an intriguing culmination of two films involving three interconnected characters... for the first two thirds at least.Nineteen years after the events of Unbreakable, David Dunn (Bruce Willis) works as a vigilante to track down criminals and bring them to justice. One day, David happens upon Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy), a man with multiple different personalities who he learns has a group of cheerleaders captive. After attempting to take matters into his own hands, David and Kevin are arrested by police and brought to mental institution, where David discovers an old acquaintance - Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson).Despite a solid first and second act, Glass unfortunately fizzles out near the end due to its underwhelming conclusion. There's so much squandered potential here that could have made this one of the most memorable, unconventional superhero films alongside the original Unbreakable, but very little of it has a chance to shine through. With that said, the best performance in the film is clearly that of James McAvoy, whose fantastic ability to play 24 different personalities showcases his talent as an actor. Unfortunately, both Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson were woefully underused, the latter of which is a big surprise considering he is supposed to be the film's main focus. As previously stated about Split, M. Night Shyamalan still has a long way to go before he is fully redeemed of some of his most awful films, but he is certainly showing glimmers of promise.I rate it 6/10",Glass
129,Alexander_Blanchett,All right conclusion but a great character piece,7,23 January 2019,"It was a decent sequel. The ""Unbreakable"" universe are among the best films of M. Night Shyamalan. It works because it follows its own interesting mythology and has an original origin. I also like the characters that were extremely well written and developed throughout the triology.
As the final conclusion I expected a more twisted and exciting twist at the end, but the final twist was somehow an excuse for a good twist. Anyway Shyamalan knew how to use symbols and style to wrap up his story. It is a very dialogue-heavy film that really takes more time to look at the characters instead of too much plot. The result is a bit messy but far from bad. Bruce Willis was a bit pale and the most uninteresting and almost invisible of the cast. Not on par with his ""Unbreakable"" turn. James McCoy once again nails it. When he becomes ""the Beast"" he overdoes it but otherwise it is a fantastic and literarily twisted performance. Also the film improved everytime Samuel L. Jackson was on screen, especially after the first third of the film. A really great performance by Jackson and one of his best characters. Sarah Paulson was also fine, although her expressions were a bit monotone but it was still an interesting performance because you never knew whats up with her. Good to see Spencer Treat Clark back who was actually good. Nice score and look in general.",Glass
130,eva3si0n,An alternative look at modern superhero,7,4 January 2021,"An alternative look at modern superhero. M. Night Shyamalan contrasts his film with contemporary trends from Marvel.

132,Eumenides_0,The conclusion of a perfect trilogy,9,25 January 2019,"My trusty sidekick IMDB tells me that the last time I bothered to write a review in this website was way back in 2013.Never in my wildest dreams did I see myself coming back, let alone to enthuse over an M. Night Shyamalan movie. Sure, I liked The Sixth Sense and Unbreakable, but the good bits in Signs didn't hide an obvious decline. For the next years I only heard about Shyamalan whenever a friend griped about another dud; his output seemed to be getting progressively worse.I was so uninterested in Shyamalan's movies I only crossed paths with them whenever Honest Trailers released another mockery. And so it was that Split flew under my radar - I now regret I didn't pay money to watch it on the big screen - until I clicked on its Honest Trailer back in 2018, expecting another belly of laughs... and for once they actually praised it. A lot. That was unexpected. More importantly, I learned it was an Unbreakable sequel. What?Of course I knew the rumors from yore that Unbreakable was intended as a trilogy; but as the years went on and nothing happened, I figured the projected had been abandoned. And a good thing too because Unbreakable was still the best superhero movie ever made after The Incredibles, and it didn't need to be ruined by Shyamalan's decline. But Split seemed interesting and meanwhile the trailers for Glass were coming out, and they were so exciting I had to watch them for closure.So I watched Split and it was as if Shyamalan had made a smooth transition from Unbreakable to it; it's as if he hadn't made anything else in between. Here was the inventive, sensitive, spiritual filmmaker I remember admiring all the way back in 2000. Here was another one of his beautiful, slow dramas about ordinary people discovering extraordinary gifts and learning to cope with them. And it was packaged as a tense thriller about a kidnapped girl trying to escape from a serial killer with multiple personalities who discovers he's more than human, like David Dunn. It was also an emotional story about finding the courage to face up to our inner demons. Thinking about it now, if I didn't cry at Split's beautiful ending, it's probably because I was subconsciously saving them for Glass.Ah, Glass. A movie so reviled by critics you'll think it was directed by Tommy Wiseau. I don't understand what happened, I don't know what they expected, and what they saw. For my part, I saw the fitful ending to what is now one of the rare perfect movie trilogies.Glass builds on the previous movies and maintains its tone and pace. By tone I mean it's a low-key superhero movie grounded on realism. Like in hard sci-fi novels, frequently the characters will discuss plausible theories for feats and powers that seem extraordinary. By pace I mean it's mostly a character drama spiced with tense situations and spliced with trappings from horror, sci-fi, mystery, and thriller.Were people really expecting a 2-hour showdown between David and The Beast? On Titan, perhaps? When were Split and Unbreakable action movies? Strange thing to expect from the sequel to a movie whose most iconic scene consists of a man standing in a train station being touched by strangers.Glass is a slow burner like its predecessors. By now we've had the characters' origin stories; they've accepted their roles as heroes and villains. We know who they are; we've grown to love them. The focus, then, is no longer on David and Kevin but on Elijah. His goal has always been to show the world that superhumans exist, in order to find a role in the world for himself, so he won't feel like a mistake anymore. As such the movie revolves around his plan to escape from a mental facility where all three are being held. Of course they'd end up there, because that's where people go who claim to be superhuman. They may believe in their powers, but the rest of the world doesn't. This is consistent with the rules Shyamalan has been playing with from the start. And even the reasons for this realistic disbelief get a twist in the end.Basically, this movie focuses on Elijah's transformation into Mister Glass, a genius supervillain; and since he's the cerebral villain you shouldn't expect action but displays of genius. And that genius is shown in the way he plots the escape and also in the third twist ending. (By my count the movie has 3 twists in a row.) Those who want to see David fighting The Beast - that's what I wanted - won't be disappointed. There are two well-directed, fluid fight scenes that seem like fossil records in this age of shaky cam and fast-cut editing. But this is Mister Glass' movie and it's all about his uber-plan; in the end, David and Kevin are just pawns in his plan to justify his existence to himself.While the plot unfolds towards its gut-wrenching climax, Shyamalan elevates the most mundane scene with odd angles, the use of color, and games of light and shadow. He imbues the movie with an atmosphere of enigmatic dread. I missed James Newton Howard's score; although West Dylan Thordson composed some very good tracks, and Shyamalan uses them to add tension and sentiment to the scenes, I wish I had heard more of the original score. Although Bruce Willis doesn't have a meaty role, nobody can complain about the performances by Samuel Jackson and James McAvoy. And then there were the little things I only picked up on the way home: the leitmotif of the train station used in the three movies. The beautiful symmetry of the ending, with Mister Glass not just bringing David and Kevin together, but also three strangers who loved those three extraordinary beings to honor them. The more I think about the movie, the more I marvel at its intricacy.I didn't feel bored for a moment. Before I knew it, the climax was on. And this is where many people say the movie was ruined. I think the fury viewers are showing is a sign that Shyamalan imparted these characters with life and so they're real to a lot of people. I wish their fates had been different. But I don't begrudge the decision nor do I think the execution was flawed. Some seem to think David deserved a more dignified ending. As someone who's been reading superhero comics since the age of 9, I sympathize with that; I personally love a heroic sacrifice, going out in a blaze of glory, one outnumbered guy holding off the line. That never fails to get me. But once again, reality-grounded rules apply. The truth is many good, heroic people don't receive a dignified ending; many, like Dunn, never even receive any recognition for their deeds.I understand that the climax is upsetting in an industry where superheroes ""die"" turned into dust after a magic finger snap; and stay ""dead"" while trailers announce one of the ""dead"" heroes' is not too ""dead"" that he can't star in another money-grabbing movie, around the same time another movie will officially undo all the ""dead"" heroes' deaths because they also need to star in some more movies, whether they're alive or ""dead"" - we can't let Disney's shareholders be kept away from money they make exploiting true creators like Jack Kirby and Jim Starlin. I can understand why so many are upset in a world where people have been trained to treat superheroes as their indestructible, unkillable, cool-one-liners-spouting virtual best friends who'll never abandon them, so long as they keep buying tickets. I mean, what kind of sadistic imbecile would kill his cash cows? Like I said, it's a testament to Shyamalan's ability to impart real life to his creations. It's funny, I've been reading DC and Marvel's superheroes for longer than I've known David Dunn; I've spent thousands of hours with them, much more than I ever did with him; I only saw Split last week. And yet nothing in those superficial, pandering, glib adaptations of my favorite superheroes has ever elicited from me the bliss I felt watching Glass. The kind of bliss I only get from well-written, well-acted, well-made human drama. I never imagined that I'd leave a theater room in 2019 crying from a M. Night Shyamalan movie.What's sadder, though, is that the critics will frighten viewers away from a movie that's better than 90% of what comes out every Summer. In a world where any crappy, soulless, mindless blockbuster makes 1 billion dollars easy, this movie probably won't even make it to 300 million. Split didn't and had better reviews. And so we'll continue to get bad thrillers, action and superhero movies full of CGI, pointless explosions, and boring, by-the-numbers, sequel-hinting storytelling everyone wants - and cynical shareholders will continue to get richer while creative filmmakers see their opportunities dwindle. Funny, even in that Glass was grounded on reality: in the end the faceless villains we never suspected existed, chilling out in elitist restaurants we can't get in, always win. Curiously, that's one of the messages in the movie: the gifted are always being held back, overshadowed by the uncreative, those who enforce normalcy. But as the ending shows, the creative ones always find a way to outsmart the bureaucrats of normalcy. I hope that with time more people will come to know the truth that the critics have been hiding.",Glass
133,CANpatbuck3664,A Less Than Heroic Conclusion That Gets the Job Done,7,26 January 2019,"I saw Unbreakable far past when it premiered in theatres and I saw Split after it was released on DVD. I feel like I'm in the minority because I liked all 3 of the movies in this trilogy but I don't really get the cult following they've inspired. But people remember these characters and I liked the direction that they're creator (M. Night Shyamalan) decided to take some of them. David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is dealing out justice as part of a vigilante team with his son Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark). Their cover as owners of a security supply business was a nice touch. Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) is being held in a psychiatric ward and him being so heavily medicated to dull his intellect made some sense to me. I also thought bringing back Casey Cooke (Ana Taylor-Joy) as a sympathetic character towards Kevin (James McAvoy) was a step in a different direction (it didn't make a ton of sense, with what he did to her fellow captives, she's willing to hug him and hold his hand?). The only character that didn't feel natural was Dr. Ellie Staple (Sarah Paulson), the movie needed someone like her and the idea surrounding her character was interesting. But they make it pretty obvious she has ulterior motives from the start, and I was never able to buy into her trying to help David, Elijah and Kevin. So, while they didn't nail every transition, the creative team did a good job updating the characters and showing their growth.Most superhero movies follow a similar formula and play the same beats in the song but one of the aspects that made Unbreakable special was it sought to tell a story of people with extraordinary abilities in a semi-realistic scenario. It didn't come down to a huge battle at the end and the movie had very real consequences for the world they constructed. That effort continues over into Glass. There's a focus put on the highly personal conflicts between the 3 main characters of the story and while they obviously didn't have the budget to do some jaw-dropping sequence, they still provided the requisite action to satisfy that part of the genre. I've said in a couple of my other reviews, it doesn't have to be about the world ending conflict every time. Give us some characters that we can attach ourselves to and create natural conflict as organically as you can (e.g. Wade Wilson and Francis/Ajax in Deadpool). I think they succeeded in doing that.The big stars from the previous movies in the Unbreakable series all return in Glass, but one member of the cast gets more screen time than the other two. The sheer amount of energy and passion in James McAvoy's performance is stunning, he never comes across as scary for me but the acting gymnastics these characters put him through is crazy. I really enjoy watching McAvoy running well past 100% and he chews scenery in the most fun way possible. His performances in both Split and Glass make both movies worth checking out. Samuel L. Jackson is great but for being the titular character, he's in the movie far less than you would expect. I heard a lot of criticism about Bruce Willis' acting going in, but he did a fine job. You can tell its not him doing the action scenes any more, but he didn't phone it in like the reviews claimed he did. Spencer Treat Clark and Ana Taylor-Joy are strong in their supporting parts. I didn't think Sarah Paulson was up to the task but its not so much her performance as what she's saddled with.I've been pretty positive so far, but Glass has a fair share of missteps. The first is the glacial pace that the movie goes along at. The action scenes are few (that's by design) but the movie fails to compensate and some of the scenes in the hospital come off as unnecessary or boring. The next is that the movie stretches plausibility pretty liberally. The amount of money invested in Kevin's, Elijah's and David's rehabilitation is a dead giveaway, the traps put in place can too easily be circumvented and Shyamalan puts a few too many twists in Glass and it makes the ending tough to swallow. The last problem is the poor dialogue which undermines many of the emotional scenes.Unbreakable, Glass and Split all fall into the middle for me, they've definitely got their respective strengths, but I feel like their weaknesses are glossed over by their cult fan bases. The acting (McAvoy's performance especially is something to behold) and the commitment to telling a more grounded and intimate story keeps Glass interesting when the run time really begins to wear out its welcome. But M. Night is his own arch-nemesis because the pacing, the dialogue, the character choices and the twists (both of the minor and major variety) are all lacklustre. Even though I liked Glass more than I didn't, this is a disappointment considering the anticipation surrounding the Unbreakable sequel. I left the theatre feeling conflicted about Glass and while I think this will be a love it or hate it type of movie, it accomplishes its goal to expand this universe and pose a few questions about how superheroes and villains would function in today's world. I'd give Glass a solid but unspectacular 6.5/10 rounding up to a 7/10. If you're a fan, check it out in theatres but newcomers could wait on this if they're too busy.",Glass
134,Beejerman,CHEER! - (7 stars out of 10),7,16 January 2019,"The stage curtains open ...In anticipation of ""Glass"" opening in theaters this weekend, I watched both ""Unbreakable"" and ""Split"" back-to-back when I got a call from my friend who happens to work at a local movie theater. He says, ""Hey. We've got our copies of ""Glass"" in. After we close tonight, we're gonna set it up and watch it. Wanna come?"" Yep. You guessed it. I jumped into the car, stopped off for some soda and candy, and joined my vampire friends for this long awaited M. Night film.It's a good thing I watched those two movies first, because this one gets right into it with very little set-up. David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is now running a home security company with his grown son, but is still very active as a vigilante in fighting crime. He finds his way to a warehouse where some kidnapped girls are being held by Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy), otherwise known as The Horde. After a battle between Dunn and The Beast, one of Crumb's multiple personalities - they are taken and remanded to an insane asylum where Mr. Glass (Samuel L. Jackson) is already at. Enter the psychiatrist, Dr. Staple (Sarah Paulson). So here we are. All three of them - together at last. Of course, ever intuitive and scheming, Mr. Glass has plans for The Beast ... and plans for Dunn as well - it becomes no holds barred as Dunn has to play protector yet again - leading to yet another M. Night Shyamalan twist.Both ""Unbreakable"" and ""Split"", though of the same trilogy, were stand-alone movies. Both distinct and different, yet contributing to the same overall story. The problem I found with ""Glass"" is that in trying to combine these two stories now into one, it really didn't develop it's own identity. And things just didn't get going in the direction I was hoping they would. Bruce Willis seemed to be happy to be back in a role that he actually cares about and it shows. James McAvoy was just excellent, pouring his all into the role - investing everything he had. Samuel L. Jackson was vintage Mr. Glass here, playing his role to the full. The movie was very well acted, it just didn't really seem to gel.I did like it though. The atmosphere of the two previous movies was captured here - the cinematography was very good, the soundtrack and movie's score was fitting. The big twist at the end had me shaking my head a little bit. To be honest, I still haven't decided if I like it yet or not - LOL. But overall? A good movie. If you are an M. Night Shyamalan fan, I think you'll enjoy this one. I would feel justified in recommending it. I plan on watching it again this weekend with a full audience to get the entire experience of it. Maybe that aspect of it will influence how I feel about the ending.",Glass

136,garabedian123,Jeez that was lame,3,17 April 2019,My first question was why did they take Bruce? Has he become such a popular superhero that everyone knows him? Maybe? We never get a chance to find out..Other than a few newspaper articles.. Why is a vigilante and a solidified serial killer being locked up together? Why do the police allow a mental institution to house a mass murderer before his trial even happens?Why are the flashback inconsistent? First we get flashbacks to the actual movie..Which were unnecessary. Then we got newly recreated versions of those same flashbacks. Why? arguments from previous movies were so pointless. Why all these unsed plot devices. The girl from split was in love with Kevin and it seemed like it was going to be a wild ending with her helping Kevin to escape. But no. ..Then the movie takes a turn and instead focuses on the side characters? WHY? We wasted so much time on the side character and it was all for NOTHING!. ..And what a lame ending..I mean really. just one of the worst endings of all times...So much uselsss rhetoric about comic books...repeated over and over again.,Glass
137,rdoubleoc,Well done.,9,16 April 2019,"Edit: I wrote this before I knew there wouldn't be another sequel (the trilogy is done, supposedly, even though I think this makes Glass and Split lesser movies -- I liked them because I thought there was more to come, almost like a long-running TV show).I wasn't expecting it to be that good, but maybe having low expectations is why I actually thought it was pretty good (I've seen a lot of bad movies and TV lately).First, you've gotta realize this movie is one of a series, with Split and Unbreakable coming before this. As long as you know that, and have seen them, you're good to go.The universe created with Glass, Split, and Unbreakable are almost better than the Marvel or DC universe movies, if you ask me, just because they're more realistic, but they really better stick to the realistic superheroes approach, and keep it high quality, or they're just going to end up being the same as Marvel and DC movies, which I think people are getting used to (I don't want to say getting tired of, since they've gotten better and are enjoyable too, like Ant Man and Deadpool).Can't wait to see what's coming next, though, since this was definitely a good movie, and a good installment in the series.If you think this movie is bad, you've been spoiled by Hollywood big-time, or just haven't seen enough bad movies.",Glass
138,AvionPrince16,Good with 3 characters from different movies,7,19 August 2021,The fight scenes was pretty intense. Elijah was pretty god in his role i enjoyed it and the guy with 12 personnalities too also david dunne. The movie reunite very well the three characters. I enjoyed all the part of the movie. But the end i found it very too much. It wasnt necessary to do this. We can perceive this like shyamalan wanted to precipitate the end or didnt know what to do with all the three characters.

139,Azanspy,An unpredictable and good ending to a long trilogy.,6,3 April 2019,"I think we all should appreciate how M. Night Shyamalan has made the Unbreakable trilogy. It is so different and fresh. These three movies has turned the superhero genre to something we haven't even thinked of. It is not as good as Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight Trilogy but Unbreakable Trilogy satisfies one who enjoy thrillers. Glass is not as good as expected. But it gets the job done. All the lead and supporting characters have done a good job. The music and cinematography were also good. The unpredictable twists and an emotional ending will definitely hooks up the viewers. If you like the the other movies in Unbreakable trilogy, Glass will definitely not disappoint you.",Glass
140,trinaboice,Great tribute to the comic book world and human spirit,9,25 January 2019,"M. Night Shyamalan gives us an intriguing superhero series that is unlike any other.

141,sbweightman,Above average but disappointing.,6,18 January 2019,"A disappointing mystery with a good cast of characters who, apart from McAvoy who is superb, don't really seem to do much acting. The plot is relatively slow, taking a long time to say very little, and although the ending is climactic, it is rather underwhelming. Interesting use of cinematography and music, but it doesn't really add anything, and a few silly moments spoil the overall experience.",Glass
142,thekingsdom,Far Too Slow,5,11 May 2019,"I actually long for the days for the studios to take back control from the directors. This film was at least 30 minutes too long. It was so slow moving and could have easily been condensed into a much tighter film. It starts off well but then stagnates for ever. After an hour, I was beginning to get bored, mainly due to the slow pacing. James McAvoy is a great actor but Anya Taylor-Joy isn't. She's quite wooden and some of her facial acting was pretty bad. She looks good though, so I suppose that's what's important in films hey. This could have been good film but sadly ends up a 5/10.",Glass
143,bgar-80932,Tried too hard,6,6 November 2019,The film was entertaining enough and James McAvoy stood out as his character was great in split and he's great here too. The writing was so/so though and they tried too hard with the superhero parallels. Samuel L. Jackson's part where he kept saying why what was going on was just like superheros was lame. Willis was alright. I was entertained enough but Split was way better.,Glass
144,PyroSikTh,Fantastic Start. Aimless Middle. Terrible Climax,6,22 January 2019,"Glass opens some time after Split, with The Horde still out there and abducting ""impure"" girls for The Beast to feast on. Except now he's being hunted by David Dunn, the unbreakable man - now dubbed The Overseer - with assistance from his now adult son Joseph. The local authorities jump at the opportunity to capture both serial killer and vigilante in one fell swoop and cart them off to a mental institution in order to be ""broken"" by a psychologist who specialises in those deluded into thinking they're superhuman.While this is not where the movie falls apart at all, it's where the cracks start to show. For the most part, the movie is very solid all the way up until the third act. The fight between Dunn and The Beast at the brick factory is fantastic, and is immediate pay-off to Split's final recontextualisation. Bringing back Spencer Treat Clark to reprise the now adult Joseph is fantastic (although Robin Wright's absence is sorely felt, despite being explained fairly satisfactorily), as was tying Shyamalan's own cameos in Unbreakable and Split together; ""Got in with some shady stuff at the stadium, but I turned my life around"" (also, the comic book store clerk is the same guy too. A* for attention to casting, but is there really only one comic shop in all of Philadelphia?).Unfortunately I felt like it tried too hard to bring too many characters back. Charlayne Woodard returns as Elijah's mother, but considering the twenty year time jump, surely she'd be dead of old-age by now? Or at the very least not nearly as spritely as she appears here (also her make-up was terrible, while we're at it). Anya Taylor-Joy also returns as Casey, the sexually abused teenager from Split, which also didn't quite fit right. I could understand her feeling a connection and maybe even responsibility for Kevin. She understands his condition more than anyone else, but Glass doesn't take place that long after Split, she's been through a lot, and those wounds from both The Horde and her uncle would be far too fresh to risk opening them up again for daily hospital visits (also while we're at it, her sense of fashion took a very sharp and sudden nosedive).While the scenes in the hospital often felt over-long and aimless, I can't say I didn't enjoy them. Seeing Kevin, David, and Elijah all in the same building, sporadically interacting with one another, was a massive joy to see. While David definitely gets the short-end of the stick (and in truth the whole movie, but more on that later), each of the three characters are given some great moments, like Elijah feigning sedation and managing to break the asylum's various security systems multiple times, or Kevin's various personalities attempting to outsmart the hypnotic lighting in their room. Even the initial breakout is captivating with some exquisite moments, like David charging down his reinforced door, or The Beast beating up security in the background while Elijah rolls himself down the corridor.But it is right at this moment that Glass just suddenly lost everything it had going for it. I'm not even sure what happened. I want to say that Shyamalan got stuck for ideas, or grew lazy and tired of the concept/characters, and so just haphazardly threw something together. But then I remember this has been the culmination of two decades of work. This is the grand finale he originally intended when Unbreakable was meant to be all three movies in one. I have a hard time believing he half-assed a movie he's been so passionate about for the last twenty years that he mortgaged his own house to finance it.That said, I do kind of understand what he was trying to do, but he did it badly and it did not work. There's a very good reason superhero movies have grown more popular the less they adhered to the comic book tone and format, something Shyamalan either hasn't thought of, or has wilfully ignored. In many ways, Glass' climax is ripped from the panels of a comic book, but what works in a comic does not work in a movie. There's monologuing, there's cheesy one-liners, there's the need to over-explain everything, the action feels disconnected and split into moments rather than a fluid sequence, and random characters interject at random times when they shouldn't even be there. Shyamalan very obviously wanted the climax to feel like a comic book, but an old and dated comic book tacked onto the end of a grounded, modern graphic novel. He casts the self-aware realism in the lofty heights of a comic book lense and it just doesn't fit.And while that is fundamentally my biggest problem with the entirety of the third act, it's by no means the worst offender. About midway through the movie, both Joseph and Elijah decide to investigate Kevin's history and find something totally shocking about his father. I'm sat there wondering who this guy is, why's he so important, what's so shocking about it that it'll transform everything? The answers are nobody, he isn't, and nothing. SPOILER ALERT, the entire revelation is that Kevin's father was on the same train as David when it crashed, meaning Elijah essentially ""created"" both of them. Well duh, that was practically spelled out in Split. I thought everyone knew that? That's not the only twist though, thankfully, but the next one isn't too great either. SPOILER ALERT; apparently there's been a super secret organisation this entire time that's been stopping superhuman individuals before they become well-known and cause a superhero revolution. As a twist in itself, it's actually pretty good, credit where credit is due, but it's poorly executed. It comes out of nowhere without any lead-up or hinting whatsoever. Our eyes are drawn to a tattoo on a sniper's wrist and I'm left wondering why on Earth is that important. I even wondered if I'd missed something, but no. Then there's another twist, the best twist in the movie SPOILER ALERT; Elijah basically planned for the whole breakout to fail. Yeah, pretty good twist. It's not typical Shyamalan levels of great twisting, but it's not too bad, and the ramifications it will have on the Unbreakable universe from then on are pretty huge.But that still isn't Glass' biggest sin. No, Glass' biggest sin is it's complete disregard for one character in particular. To be the finale of a trilogy as grand as this, main characters had to die. That goes without saying. SPOILER ALERT: The Beast takes a pop at Elijah after the train revelation, which pretty much decimates his entire body, as you can probably imagine. The Beast is momentarily jerked back to Kevin himself, just long enough for a badly-placed sniper shot (seriously, why the gut, when the head is a certain killshot?) to break the previously bulletproof skin. This is all fine. Villains die all the time. Even the heroes die, and David is no exception. What is an exception is that he is unceremoniously drowned in a puddle. Sure, it ties back to a line in Unbreakable, but it means that while both Elijah and Kevin get profound goodbyes from their loved ones (who shouldn't even be there), David gets nothing. He gets an unworthy death in the muck of the Earth without any heartfelt moment to his son. I mean I get what Shyamalan was going for, but sh** man, a puddle? Really? He's the hero of the entire trilogy, the only good guy in the whole thing, and you end him like that? It felt cruel and harsh just for the sake of it.Okay, I've got more to say, but I think I've pratted on long enough. I don't quite feel as bad about Glass as I did about, say, Justice League, but it was still a pretty lacklustre finale to two of his absolute best movies. It was a discredit to what came before. It felt unfinished, unsatisfactory, and overly-restricted in budget (seriously, the final fight between David and Beast is them just ramming each other into a van repeatedly). The first two-thirds of the movie is top-notch. We get pay-offs, injections of nostalgia, some exquisite interactions between characters, and some great moments. The story is built-up expertly. Unfortunately, as is unusual for Shyamalan who, even at his worst moments, is usually really good at sticking the landing, Glass just loses its steam at its zenith, and completely falls into disarray. Maybe a second viewing would make me feel better about it, but as it is I think I'll just stick to Unbreakable and Split as a duology. They're both great movies in their own right, so don't need the pay-off Glass failed to deliver anyway. I give Glass a slightly above average 6/10, because it isn't a complete failure, it's just a disappointment of missed potential.",Glass
145,CinematicInceptions,Unique and interesting with room for criticism.,7,29 January 2019,"Even though anyone who is familiar with writer/director M. Night Shyamalan knows to expect a twist in his movies, I think that ""Glass"" will end up differently than any viewer expects it to. Not necessarily in a shocking way, but it's not an easy story to predict and is better for it. Even though fans probably weren't anticipating the meeting of Mr. Glass, David Dunn, and Kevin Crumb as much as in other extended universe crossover movies, the crossover nature of the movie is handled very effectively. Whereas the Avengers movies tend to just serve the purpose of bringing a bunch of heroes together to defeat a more powerful villain than in the solo movies, ""Glass"" uses the meeting of its characters to develop them much further and have them play off of each other in interesting ways. Each of the three characters have very different backstories, and even though this crossover movie is largely about bringing them together, it takes a lot of time to deal with them and their unique situations individually.A major selling point of the movie, as with ""Split"", is James McAvoy's off the wall performance in the role of a character with 24 personalities. While there is less focus on him here than in ""Split"" we get to see a few glimpses of the other personalities that we didn't see in ""Split"", along with the ones that have more prominence. Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson have both given better performances, but do their jobs more than adequately. Also returning are Elijah's mother, David Dunn's son, and Casey.But the main plot of the movie centers around the one new character, Doctor Ellie Staple (Sarah Paulson) trying to convince her three patients that their abilities that are not supernatural, and are less potent than they have been led to believe. This is where I think ""Glass"" really sets itself apart. Some people could argue that every movie and story is about the hero discovering their true potential in one way or another, and superhero movies are more blatant than most about this. So it was cool to see a story where the heroes begin to doubt their own abilities. In some ways it felt more true to life. I've always loved the scenes where superheroes first discover the extent of their powers, but it's not an experience that most of us have had. However, I think practically everyone has had to give up on some kind of dream in their life. There was a time when I was little that I tried to convince myself that I had special powers, but I gave up this idea after the adults around me brought me back to reality. I'm sure I'm not the only kid who had that experience, and while it is necessary, it's still disappointing to be told that you aren't special in the way you want to be, so I liked that the characters in this movie had to go through that.On the whole, I'm still not quite sure how to feel about the movie as a whole. It definitely isn't bad, but I'm not quite sure how good it is. It definitely does some unique storytelling things, which I applaud it for. It also proves that Marvel has not made the only good version of a crossover movie. Still, there were a few points that felt iffy. There was one area that I think was particularly weak, but I won't go into detail about it to avoid giving spoilers. I guess it is safe to say that there was room for improvement, but I think that there are lessons that writers and storytellers can take from this movie.Out of all of the movies released in January, this is the only one that I think is worth seeing. January is a month for people to see the awards season films they didn't make it to in December and for that reason, it's notoriously the worst movie of the year. So if you don't like the look of anything up for an Oscar but still want to go see something, this is a good pick. I will strongly advise that you see both ""Unbreakable"" and ""Split"" (in either order) beforehand because ""Glass"" references them both in ways that remind you of what happened in both of them but do not actually get you caught up. Overall Rating: 7.6/10",Glass
146,Darth_Osmosis,A great conclusion!,8,21 January 2019,"This movie is not perfect and there is room for improvement, however it is definitely a good solid ending to the somewhat ""surprise trilogy"" that this has turned to be. It builds upon themes established in the previous installments and has a few new tricks as well. There are also twists, ""but of course!"" Luckily they more like the early ""good Shyamalan twists"" not the ones that have become punchlines.. I really do hope this will indeed be the end, and there aren't going to be a continuation of this saga, let it end on a high note! The only reason I can think to not to see this if you are even a bit interested, is if you have not seen the two previous movies.. they are sort of needed to enjoy or even understand much of this. In which case I strongly suggest seeing those(they are great movies!) first, and then proceed to see this if you liked the series so far.",Glass
147,sweidman-28016,Good Final Movie,6,25 January 2019,"Glass Review:Glass is the final film of the Unbreakable trilogy consisting of the movies Unbreakable and Split. I love Split and Unbreakable. I just remember going to see Split for my birthday and the twist at the end making it a sequel to Unbreakable made it that much better. Naturally I was excited for this movie. I liked this movie but not as much as I hoped for. The plot was interesting and not what I really thought it would be like. The first act of the movie was what I was expecting and I really liked it. The second act slowed down, which I was fine with, and took an interesting approach. Then the final act was action packed and really good up until the end, which I didn't care for. M. Night Shyamalan did well directing. He's one of the most hated directors just because he does something not so typical. Yes he's had a rough patch with some really bad films, but we forget about that. This trilogy is probably his best direction other than The Sixth Sense. The actors were all very good. I did expect more from Bruce Willis. He just played the same character with the same arc, but opposite, as he did in Unbreakable. I would've thought there'd be some change to his character. Spencer Treat Clark returns as Joseph Dunn and I didn't think he did that great of a job. Samuel L. Jackson did well as Elijah Price/Mr. Glass. St first I wasn't that happy what they did with his character (not talking much till an hour in and coming in much later), but then I started to appreciate it. James McAvoy is amazing as Kevin Wendell Crumb once again. This is his career defining role after Charles Xavier. We see some more personalities which I liked and The Beast's full power. Sarah Paulson's character was fine until the big twist at the end. She just kind of told the audience what was happening even though we all knew what was going on. Anya Taylor-Joy is great as always. I've loved her in all her roles since The VVitch. The score by West Dylan Thordson was good like he did with Split. It brought back the main themes if people caught that like I do. Going back to the script, there were scenes back in the second act that I just loved. Elijah Price's confrontation with The Beast was by far the best. Also Sarah Paulson's character making the three question everything really got me thinking which I loved. It was a good movie, I was just expecting more. I didn't care for the twist much. Also I didn't like the movie's ending much. There was a perfect spot with Sara Paulson just screaming that I thought was the perfect ending but it took a different, lighter approach. I'd suggest seeing this movie. Yes, it's my least favorite but it's still good. Split and Unbreakable are at a tie for me because I loved those films a lot (both are at probably an A-). Check this one out.My Score: B",Glass
148,funtasticfour,Sometimes great movie + great movie = good movie,6,18 August 2019,"M Night gets a bad rap sometimes. People loved his first few movies and then complained about most of the rest. I've loved most of his movies and complained about few. Unbreakable was great, as was Split, and on that, most people agree. So this movie should have been awesome, right? Well, it started out with a great idea that I don't think he knew what to do with. Was it rushed after the surprise ending of Split? Possibly. I enjoyed the characters and the story up until the end which fizzled. Normally his endings are some sort of twist that people try to guess, and I definitely did not guess this one because up until then I was considering an 8 for this review. Not a huge plot twist or Alfred Hitchcockian ending, but instead, unfortunately, a dull one.",Glass
149,Offworld_Colony,"I like M Night's recent low-budget, high-concept filmmaking resurgence;",7,6 February 2020,"Good quality, well directed, shlocky B-Movies and Glass is a lovely continuation of that. With what starts clearly as a slasher horror, evolves into a monster movie, a grounded superhero movie, and then a deconstructionist superhero movie, a psychological drama, and then even an exercise on empathy and villainry. Willis is back on form and McAvoy is back with another bravura performance, Jackson is preferably restrained and by the mid-point I could have seen several more in the M.N CU; I was intrigued by whether Dunn's son could have any powers, and excited when I was reminded about Crumb's parents. It's really a cohesive and varied film with a very real sense of mystery and thrust and tension, which is a testament to how more of an anthology type cinematic universe can keep the lore fresh.
When the film became a bit more conspiracy filled at its third act, I was less enthused; glad it didn't suffer from a sky beam third act, and yet the smallness of it was disappointing, but the film had earned a little dispensation and Shyamalan's penchant for twistery is, as usual, double-edged; obvious but with a little cleverness in there somewhere.
Yeah there's a handful of Shyamalan's typical stodgy 'street' dialogue and another gratuitous cameo, but Glass is a wonderful achievement and much better than the Unbreakable 2 and 3 that would have surfaced if these were made, as planned, straight after. I love the music sitting between superhero and horror, I love that the actor from Unbreakable playing Dunn's son is back and brilliant, and I love that the film is intent on explaining as much as possible and all character motivations seem logical. There's not enough of that in normal superhero films, so despite the mixed critical reviews, i found this film a joy to watch.",Glass

I wasn't expecting much because instead of seeing it when it first came out , like I wanted to, I checked the rating. I kept waiting for it to disappoint but it was a roller coaster. More of a thinking movie not an action packed blockbuster. It's an understated coup de grace. I actually want to go back and watch all three movies again.",Glass
151,acedj,Movie of the year,10,27 January 2019,"I was instantly hooked by Unbreakable, so many years ago. Then came Switch. James McEvoy blew me away with his performance. When Glass was announced, I was beyond excited.
This movie did not disappoint. The pace was that of the thinking man, and while on the outside it is a super hero movie, at its core it is a thinking man's drama. Sam Jackson, Bruce Willis and James McEvoy turn in stellar performances. This is a must see.
I have read a lot of negative reviews on here and I don't quite understand why that is. This movie keeps pace with the two that came before it. Granted there is not a whole lot of character exploration here, but that was handled in the two previous films. This is a masterpiece that nicely closes the trilogy. And slight spoiler, it even leaves room for the hope of a fourth film, GASP!
Ignore the haters and go have yourself one heck of a time with this one. It is a nice break from the Marvelverse that has taken over the movies.",Glass
152,nikola17,what was M Night was thinking,2,14 June 2019,"God even this got worse i never saw this at theater i rented at library because i knew i had a very bad feeling about this movie and when i watched it their it is i can't believe M. Night Shyamalan wanted to ended like this ??? really this feels like a ending that let people down this film was just useless a lot of times and i think M Night is a overrated film director of all time the movie i loved really first one in franchise Unbreakable i loved that movie to death then 17 years later we had a bad rubbish boring pointless split with James McAvoy a spin off sequel witch is based on Unbreakable, and i hated actor James McAvoy a lot i think he is boring actor of all time i hated him i think in role of him people a lot The Horde: A twenty-seven year old who is a former Philadelphia Zoo employee with 23 different personalities whose body chemistry changes with each personality, resulting in a 24th personality known as ""The Beast i am like whatever he doesn't scare me i think he is annoyest character in movie franchise of all time i hated split i thought this would be better movie in franchise, but this ended not to well i don't understand why this got a 37% rotten tomatoes i still don't understand why it hasn't got worst movies in franchise ever just like with another movies. this is worser film i have ever saw in my life that completely ruined franchise Unbreakable is fantastic movie that movie can have sequels but not directed by M.Shyamalan or anyone like that but no M night is just milking his franchise like he doesn't care anymore he just ruined entire and destroyed entire franchise of his own but that's how he wanted to end it like that ? really M night must been a very weak film director of all time.
their are things i like about movie is when Bruce Willis is back as David Dunn and his son Joseph Dunn (Spencer Treat Clark) BACK that was good thing and still luv how David saved those cheerleader girls tried up and then he saves them that was my favorite scene and he gets into fight with beast that was best scene ever in this movie only. and Samuel l Jackson looks bored, tried saying get me out of this piece of crap movie he is looking at camera like he is bored as hell not well. there's nothing much of Samuel l Jackson character in this movie ever because all he does he sits down in wheelchair he is sitting quiet and got his head turned sideways saying i am freaking bored of this crap.i thought this was horrible and ruined movie in franchise James Mcavoy never liked him as actor i thought his acting did nothing at all. at starting to middle is great It Was But turns out to be Mostly Disappointing towards at final showdown at end of film you will get what i am saying. The second half makes this movie end with a sense of betrayal as the entire buildup of the last 2 movies and the first half are ruined. The ending wastes a lot of potential that these movies have set up and trades it in for a conventional message to the viewers. like everyone dies and their was stupid moments that slowed down the scene where James Mcavoy character the beast just found out his real name is Kevin Wendell Crumb he is a bad guy and the girl Casey Cooke
(Anya Taylor-Joy) who survived from split you feel sorry for her but in this movie she cry's and cries about Beast who killed her dad, her best close friends Eaten ? so she cares about him and Kevin Wendell father died in train crash in first unbreakable where David Dunn survived. and now Kevin finds out that Glass did it so that makes character Kevin the beast or The Horde whatever his name is, is now a good guy ??? man this writing of film is confusing as hell, Kevin who killed her father and her friends she cry's about him and cares about him ? jeez so he is evil bad guy in split she try to kill him now cares about him ? WOW stupid plot story that twist is nothing interesting about it it's dumb and ruined movie franchise i ever saw that M night should retire of being a film director. it feels unfinished, leaves you a empty glass. you see Bruce willis David Dunn character got killed off in a water piddle with a bunch of losers, then having a sad ending with all characters witch David Dunn Bruce willis character doesn't deserve to die in a stupid way, i mean Kevin and glass is the one who should off died rather then David witch it looks really stupid. reading reviews is just dumb they just say it's great because of James Mcavoy oh the twist i am like give me a massive break here, this film is ruined badly you expected more from it there's no point of seeing this sequel or split because Unbreakable has ended better no point having franchise unless they hire different director for film not this crap, i never expected this crap at all. don't like this movie all over because it's based on franchise or it's Bruce willis don't support it, your supporting a director who is hacker who made a lot of bad movies expect for Unbreakable, Sixth Sense, Signs. but this will make you feel like crap because towards at end it's national Disaster this makes Bruce willis feels like crap to him i don't know how this got a green light oh in earth did script got a green light i don't get it how in earth someone didn't stop M Night making this is a final disaster that killed the film in franchise, 3 main protagonist after having a ""showdown"" are killed by a Secret group of people who just kill superheroes no matter if they do bad or good I can't remember why. And it has this ending message about all of us having a superpower inside us. Well I think that's what it was trying to say at that point I just wanted to go home. All in all I would notrecommend this movie at all if you want to see it remember the ending i said it's going to piss you off and death scene of David Dunn looks dumb and silly, stupid. this is why i don't read the reviews then me running to theater and seeing this crap ? i don't know how in earth people like this i wish this was one of worst 2019 films that are bombed and worst films of all time, this is very ruined we can't have happy endings all time ? alright but least can this movie end well and better just like first Unbreakable film ? if you love Unbreakable if you like or hated split, you will hate this film too death this is flophouse that the trailers and reviews made you to go and watch it too believe it's going to be good believe me it's not going to be good oh yeah in die hard scene 1988 where Bruce willis was taking out glass under his foot then cop said glass, bruce willis line Glass ? who gives a s*it about Glass that was 35 years ago before way before that M Night should have learned from Bruce willis not to make movie at all because no gives a crap about it.",Glass
153,akcenat,Surprisingly watchable superhero movie,7,15 August 2019,"""Glass"" is the finale to the loose M. Night Shyamalan trilogy comprised of 2000's ""Unbreakable"" and 2017's ""Split."" As the third installment in a series of films, the story of three characters believed to have superpowers, movie combines acting powerhouses in David Dunn (Bruce Willis), Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy) and Mr. Glass (Samuel L. Jackson). The cast is intriguing while James McAvoy arguably saves the film, although this will depend on your taste for his previous performances. His transformative display of personalities is a mesmerizing showcase of his talent, flitting between wildly different roles at the flash of a bulb. Never the less, the ultimate endgame is somewhat disenchanting, disappointing and anticlimactic. There are issues of course, clumsy dialogue and forced exposition not withstanding, but at the same time there is enough here to make for an enjoyable watch nonetheless.Rating: 7-",Glass
154,stevenrotherforth,"A fruitless, lacklustre and unneeded sequel",5,23 May 2019,"GlassM. Night Shyamalan completes his secret trilogy with a rather lacklustre movie.
'Glass' isn't all we hoped for and despite yet another fantastic performance or should I say performances by James McAvoy this film falls flat on its face in a puddle and drowns.
'Glass' isn't terrible, it's just that we never asked for or needed it.
But when Shyamalan teased us with the concept that both 'Unbreakable' and 'Split' were part of a shared universe we the audience got excited about where his story could go.
Bringing McAvoy's multiple personas together with Bruce Willis's character (David Dunn) and Samuel L Jackson's Elijah Price (Mr Glass) was unexpected and intriguing.
However this movie is a wasted opportunity with no real payoff at the end.
Glass and Dunn had their story with a beginning, middle and end in the magnificent 'Unbreakable'.
As did McAvoy's characters in the surprisingly impressive 'Split'.
Proceedings in 'Glass' kind of spoil the memory of those previous films.
The characters are supposed to be superhuman but none of them turn out to be all that super.
As aforementioned this is one underwhelming film.
There's nothing for the audience to get their teeth into and the film seems pointless and forced.
I wouldn't say I had a horrible time watching it but I did shrug my shoulders as credits rolled wandering what all the fuss was about.",Glass
155,iamjamalwhite,Good effort to tie things together -- weird ride,7,18 January 2019,"OK, as a huge lover of UNBREAKABLE, I went in to this with very high expectations. It was better than SPLIT but did not live up to the original for me. The problem was in the evidence of superpowers. I'll leave it to that as to not give any spoilers, but as an example. If you are Superman, to prove it, you just have to fly or lift a car or bounce a bullet off your chest. End of discussion. Anyway, went with a group and we thought it was fun. The ending wasn't good but it could definitely set up a series. RENT THIS!",Glass
156,LloydBayer,"As the conclusion to this original superhero trilogy, Glass feels unfinished and empty.",4,18 January 2019,"As with most of his films, Writer-Director M. Knight Shyamalan's widely appreciated trait is to pull the rug under our feet during the film's closing minute. Which is why we all thought Split was a psychological horror film until the last minute, where that final unbroken shot sweeps across a diner until it stops over Bruce Willis' David Dunn. That's when we realised we were watching the sequel to one of Shyamalan's best films - Unbreakable. When Spilt revealed that it existed in the same universe as Unbreakable, it instantly positioned those films as two-thirds of a trilogy. And almost immediately after, Shyamalan revealed that Glass would be the finale to an idea gestating for nearly 20 years. That itself sounds like a labour of love for Shyamalan who not only embraces but also defies popular comic book logic.Picking up roughly a few weeks after the climactic events in the previous film, Glass has Willis' vigilante David Dunn, James McAvoy's deeply disturbed serial killer Kevin Crumb, and Samuel L Jackson's titular criminal mastermind assemble for a face to face showdown for the first time. You just have to wait for nearly the entire length of the film for that to happen. To get there, Shyamalan takes us through a long and elaborate setup where he's showing us one thing but secretly doing something else; His preferred modus operandi maybe, but this time employing the illusion of delusion. Which is where Sarah Paulson joins the story as a psychiatrist whose speciality is in debunking people deluded into thinking they are superhuman. Read that again. In other words, there may have been others who think they are superheroes. This is the single most commendable idea in the entirety of this trilogy. It simply means that unlike popular characters from the Marvel and DC comics, Shyamalan's superheroes are not from another planet, or a result of lab experiments gone wrong. It's an idea that has immense potential, not only for this film but also for any indie filmmaker who wants to tell a superhero story in the future. Shyamalan got this right, but only in theory.The execution is a different story, and why Glass is a shattered mess. As much as Dunn, Crumb and Mr. Glass are fleshed out characters on their own, they are strangely incompatible together. It's as if Shyamalan has invested so much attention on their individual character development that he has overlooked the whole purpose of what they were meant to become. Instead, a lot of time is spent reintroducing the same characters again. That's an unforgivable mistake for the final episode in a trilogy. The passage of time is also another questionable flaw. Dunn is seen in his rain poncho from 19 years ago and he is helped by his son Joseph track down petty street criminals. If not for a fully grown Spencer Clark Treat as Joseph, you would think nothing has changed since the first film. On the other hand, McAvoy was praised for his outstanding versatility in Split. Shyamalan knows that and so gives us a triple dose of McAvoy cycling between Hedwig, Kevin, Barry, Dennis, Patricia and even more of growling and wall crawling from The Beast. The air of mystery and terror turns to repetition, which feels like a stall for time and a full hour before Jackson's catatonic Mr. Glass has anything to say. Have you ever seen a film where the notoriously verbose Samuel L Jackson does nothing but blink?In time everything falls to pieces. The biggest problem with this film isn't how disjointed the narrative is, or the unnecessary recap of the previous two films at laborious pacing, or even the complicated attempt at another twist ending. The problem is that despite nearly 20 years in the making, Glass feels unfinished and empty. Akin to the concept in the film, it's like finding a solid gold bar and then throwing it out through a window.",Glass

James McAvoy steals the show with his 23 personalities and he is simply magnificent as The Beast .. A great comic book superhero film.,Glass
159,thomasjay-2201,Terrible end and film,5,26 January 2019,"Well, I certainly did not expect this from what's become a somewhat cult 'franchise' at this point. Unbreakable is a fantastic film and Split was a decent little horror which had a slightly forced finale but this was a massive letdown. The first hour or so was quite solid in terms of quality, the premise is well set, it's groundend and believable, stylish and most of all entertaining, then comes the cliff dive. After the coming together of characters we get the action spliced with the 'human' side characters who are all linked to the protagonists in some way and have a vested interest in preventing this small scale battle which in the grand scheme of things has no impact at all and minimal stakes. After the 60 minute mark things also become predictable and obvious which removes any interest or reward in viewing leaving only a hollow shell of a film. The finale is the knockout punch of dissapointment with the 'twist' being that the series is entirely grounded in reality meaning all the heroes are real before they're suddenly and easily killed off, one by one which leads to the reveal of the 'masterplan' by Samuel L Jackson's Mr.Glass. Turns out the entire ending battle was streamed live and then posted onto various online outlets, this has no effect on the character of Ellie Staple or the nameless organisation and there's a roughly 10 minute sequence which follows the side characters and reveals the impact of the prior events, which oddly felt like an hour itself and by this point I was willing it to end. Somehow Shyamalan managed to lose the charm and appeal of the previous films to deliver and I quote ""a grand operatic end"" which ultimately misses the target by a long distance, an absolute letdown",Glass
160,backup-50362,Disappointing,1,22 March 2021,"After I saw Split I was excited to see the finale, but this felt exactly like watching the Cube movies and then their ridiculously bad finale.This just had to go way too far and ridiculous and end in a garbage way that isn't satisfying whatsoever. After all the great performances, particularly by James McAvoy, this is the ""explanation"" and ending we get?The relationship between James McAvoy's character and Anya Taylor-Joy's character particularly shined in both this and the previous movies and had potential to bring the whole thing to a meaningful, satisfying end. But nah. Garbage ""plot twist""-y elements had to be shoved in, predictable as always, ruining the whole thing.Pathetic. If you liked Split, by all means don't watch this.",Glass
161,akshatmahajan,Weakest part of the trilogy,4,1 August 2021,"This movie is the weakest entey in M. Night Shyamalan's Unbreakable trilogy. This movie was literally unnecessary and was made just to kill all the protagonists. It looked like the movie was made to forcefully end the trilogy.The suspense built-up was bad, unlike the first two parts. The movie was unable to blend suspense, drama and horror together. Everything felt forced or unnatural, especially the story. I only liked the performance of James McAvoy. That was the only thing which kept the movie standing otherwise it was too weak. I didn't expect that Shyamalan would end this strong trilogy with such a weak story.Overall, this movie was unnecessary, forceful and weak ending of a great trilogy. Can't understand if I should recommend this to you or not but you can try this only if you have watched Unbreakable and Split.",Glass
162,jamiedarlow-37510,A nice surprise of a sequel!,7,21 March 2020,"Following just days after the events of Split and 19 years after Unbreakable, Glass follows Kevin Crumb (James McAvoy), David Dunn (Bruce Willis) and Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) all finally joined together under the same roof; specifically in a psychiatric hospital where renowned psychologist Dr. Ellie Staple (Sarah Paulson) aims to introduce them all to the possibility that they are not superheroes as they have been led to believe. It's a very slow paced film and that may prove to be a problem for any audiences after the pulse-pounding thriller that the trailers would suggest. What we have instead is a thoughtful thesis on psychosis and the superhero theory as explored in Unbreakable but even further into comic book lore which is quite a fascinating subject that stayed with me a while after watching. Performance wise, all three central characters are reprised brilliantly with Jackson being a particular stand out here; such a great character and a beautiful performance. It's great to see McAvoy shine again in such a mesmerising role (one of the best performances I think I've ever seen!) and Willis as the reluctant hero. Anya Taylor-Joy and Spencer Treat Clark return to continue the more emotional side to the stories and is handled very delicately. It's cleverly written in terms of creating a final part to a trilogy that we didn't know we were getting until now! There are moments of violence which are brilliantly done and one in particular that sent tingles down my spine from how unexpected and stealthy it was. It does unfortunately suffer a little bit from what most sequels to great films do; it doesn't hold the level of mystery, suspense or terror of its predecessors which had the upper hand of introducing these characters that were unpredictable at the time. As we know the characters a little more now, we know more of what to expect. Having said that, there are a few decent twists and it is still a huge amount of fun seeing these characters thrive and their stories continue. I gasped, I giggled, I enjoyed it thoroughly",Glass

After the disappointing viewing experience of How to Train your Dragon:3 (Sorry, it's my view), I finally got the IMAX experience I wanted. It's not about getting immersed in the visuals. If you have a proper script, you don't need the use of 3D/4D.
This is a provoking movie. Embrace yourself, because it gets totally thrilling after every drama scene.Director Shyamalan has nailed it from writing to directing and I think this is his comeback movie. The only con is Bruce Willis' character, which he doesn't get enough room, maybe because the title of the movie is Glass. The ending is converging, bring a lot of questions but still this will be the surprise flick of 2019.
Don't trust the RT ""rotten"" critics. Just don't! Maybe they haven't watch the previous two installments.

164,DeBBss,What an Utter Disappointment,5,2 September 2019,"As a fan of Unbreakable and Split, seeing all the characters in one single movie is exciting to say the least. I thought that it would be impossible for M. Night Shyamalan to screw up the characters and/or the universe; I thought wrong. M. Night Shyamalan built these characters with separate movies, making none of the characters lacking in context. I was really hoping that M. Night Shyamalan wouldn't try his good old twists, because I knew that if he tried, it would mess up the universe he built.The biggest issue with the movie is how slow and boring it is, and I never complain about slow pacing. The movie was building up for this one event or showdown, but it never happened. You just can't build up for a big finale and end the movie with it never happening, and then killing off the characters that we care about. We get all three characters: David Dunn, Elijah Price, and Kevin Wendell Crumb/ The Beast in a mental hospital, being treated for their ""Gifts"". For the longest time it felt like the movie just stopped dead because of nothing meaningful happening. In the third act, we get what we all wanted; a fight between the beast and David Dunn, but all the build up made the fight underwhelming.The movie introduces a new character, Dr. Ellie Staple, who is even more boring than the movie itself. It felt like she had no motive or story for why she was interrogating the three characters. We later find out she works for a corporation that tries to eradicate people who have powers. Other than Dr. Ellie Staple, the script doesn't introduce anyone knew; and there was little more to know about the already known characters, so there was no character building.The cinematography and overall color of the movie creates a lethargic vibe, which is then added to the slow pacing of the film. The cinematography isn't bad, I like it, but it's just too droopy when it's added to a movie like this. The acting is plain, but not in a bad way; it felt as if none of the actors had slept in a week. What makes Glass even more boring is the soundtrack. It's not a bad soundtrack, but it's slow and calming in some aspects.The final fight scene was realistic and little CGI was used, which is a good and a bad thing. I enjoy realistic fight scene, the brutality and power can make it even more entertaining than CGI filled scenes. The movie has a pg-13 rating so the violence had to be toned down, and that's the main reason why the fight was so underwhelming. I'm certain that if the final fight was brutal, then it would have made up for everything else.I really wanted to enjoy Glass, but the movie was such a waste of potential. There was little world and character building in this movie, which made the film feel pointless. Everything from the cinematography to the music gave off a boring slow vibe, and it was obviously on purpose, but if you're going to do that, then you have to have an interesting plot. I wouldn't recommend this movie if you weren't a fan of the series, or if you haven't seen the previous movies, because you are going to hate this movie, more than the fans did.",Glass
165,jayjaycee,"Shattered expectations, yet mildly entertaining",6,15 March 2020,"""Glass"" is a 2019 thriller directed by M. Night Shyamalan starring James McAvoy and Bruce Willis. After it has turned out that the packing 2000 drama ""Unbreakable"" and the heart racing 2016 thriller ""Split"" take place in the same universe where superhuman abilities are no fiction, it was clear that it would not take long for the infamous director to announce a sequel to both, a final conclusion to the secretly connected features that would let the three protagonists clash together in an equally packing showdown. The expectations of the general movie goer were accordingly high and that's why most of them were so disappointed with the final result. It's without a doubt not on the same level as it's predecessors and suffers from some severe problems, but still manages to deliver decent fun. First of all, it's a tremendous pleasure to see that all the actors from the original films have returned in their respective roles and again showed their acting talent. From an always ingenious McAvoy, over a stoic Willis to an unpredictable Jackson they all get along very well on screen. It's also notable that MNS has a distinct style in terms of film making and that his ability to craft magnificently looking films once again has shown here. There are the same unusual camera angles and the prominent play of colours. If there's one thing I miss in here, it's the brilliant writing style he uses to show in the previous films. The dialogue isn't on the same level of genius as before and I also missed this particular feeling of intensive curiousity in here, what I consider rather sad, as it was what made the predecessors stand out in the first place. It's just missing. Furthermore, what I expected to see in this film wasn't directly an action spectacle, but a cat and mouse game between the hero, The Overseer, and the dangerous villain, The Horde and how Mr. Glass would have a hand in it. Instead, all of them are captured in the first minutes and kept in a mental institution where a doctor tries to tell them that superheroes don't exist. This attempt of a ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" for humans with extraordinary abilities doesn't only tear down the philosophy and puts the quintessence of the previous movies in jeopardy, it also doesn't move on in a bit. In a slow way, the story unfolds and takes a strange amount of the runtime to explore the characters again. What makes it so dumb is the simple fact that the intensive exploration of the protagonists already took place in the prequels and thus wastes enough time spending on this unnecessary aspect that lead to no results or didn't add anything new to it. So basically, the film loses most of it's runtime to it instead of really allowing the already well elaborated characters to come together. Although it's supposed to pose as the first conflict between them, it's again nothing but an unnecessary continuation of their origin stories. Come on, they have already been fully developed!? There's no need to lengthen it over and over again. Furthermore, another typical Shyamalan flaw has shown itself again: When finally something happened and the three main characters stepped in the ring for a final showdown, I was hoping to finally get the ultimate battle. But what have I got instead? An exchange of a few words, the hero and the villain throwing each other into a van over and over again and ... nothing else? It's anticlimactic, anticlimactic and again anticlimactic and it tremendously frustrated me! The peak of it was as the director decided to kill off all of them in an unimaginably simple way. Kevin just shot by a single round? David drowned in a puddle? Elijah dying from internal injuries? Not only was it underwhelming and utterly stupid, it also treats those original characters with immense disrespect. It's like he spit in the face of them and the previous films. I'm aware that the death of heroes is a common thing in the comic books and play a significant role at times, but in this case it's just dull and the result of MNS disability to wrap up his films in an appropriate way. Also, what's the point of implying the existence of a secret organisation in literally the last minutes? Plot convenience, I assume. Have I mentioned before that it's anticlimactic? Even the the typical Shyamalanian plot twist could not make it any better. All in all, this conclusion is a parade example for a film that suffers from high expectations. While it's still well crafted and is decent fun when you loved the predecessors, it's undeniably suffering from it's messy screenplay. The premise once again has shown immense potential, but the way it's executed makes it less brilliant than the other films. It could have gone in such a magnificent direction if it treated the characters with respect instead of just killing them. It's a mindless fun to enjoy if one can shut off the brain towards the typical mistakes of the director. A mediocre showdown of brilliant characters that, compared to it's predecessors, doesn't live up to their greatness. A disappointment indeed, but in the context of the trilogy, a forgettable yet decent watch nonetheless.",Glass
166,gavinp9,Solid comic book film without being over-the-top,7,19 January 2019,"'Glass' is the final film in the trilogy that started with 'Unbreakable' back in 2000, where we met reluctant hero, the indestructible David Dunn (Willis) and the evil mastermind with brittle bones, Elijah Price/Mr Glass (Jackson). Then, in 'Split', we met (most of) the 24 personalities of Kevin Crumb (McAvoy) - he deserves to be nominated for an Oscar for these roles. This film does well to bring together, by having them in a mental hospital being analysed by Dr Staple (Paulson), who thinks they have superhero delusions.It's a bit slow in parts, as we delve into the psychosis that may be affecting each of them, but there's the inevitable break-out and final 'battle'. Shyamalan does well to reference comic books and superheroes, whilst treading the line between homage and imitation. The colour motifs throughout are excellent and the soundtrack is good. Nice support from Casey (Taylor-Joy), Joseph (Clark) and Mrs Price (Woodard), all reprising their roles.Fitting conclusion, with a not-totally-groundbreaking twist, but still something you're unlikely to see coming. Final scene is great. While Willis is understated and Jackson doesn't get too much actual screen time, the film belongs to McAvoy - he's excellent as Patricia/Dennis/Hedwig/The Beast (as the main four personalities we see) and brings something different to each character he portrays.",Glass
167,thebricks,"Started out great, ended like a terrible nineties school project",1,19 January 2019,"In spite of the success of Split, this movie was woefully low budget and it showed. The whole film must have taken place during the Trump government shutdown because there is no staff around to watch these three metahumans who are supposed to be incredibly cunning and dangerous. There is one guy and if you take him out, no one will notice for a long time. There is an army of security guys outside who didn't seem to be trained or even interested in doing their job. Guards open gates and don't even give the people walking through them a second look or ask for ID. If this did take place during the government shutdown, it is plausible these guys were retirees asked to volunteer their time. It would make perfect sense given how incompetent they were.The final scene is such an epic fiasco, one has to wonder if it was intentional. These three metahumans escape the world's worst psychiatric hospital/prison, tear through security guards who were under the impression they were being paid to just drive around by their charitable bosses and not to actually stop patients from leaving. The police who show up likely were unemployed guys eating breakfast at the local Denny's, hired for the day and given cheap uniforms, riot shields and not much else. It showed. There's an unintentionally hilarious shot of Mr. Glass in his wheelchair by the van with one of these actors doing a bad job of playing dead that it's beyond distracting.I'm honestly amazed Shyamalan can keep getting work. He's the worst director I have ever seen. Just when you think he's turned it around, he reminds you exactly what he truly is.10 stars out of 10 if this was a comedy, 1 star if it was a serious movie.",Glass
168,henrycoles9,Underwhelming conclusion to the trilogy,7,13 May 2020,All three superheroes/villains locked up in a psychiatric hospital is by no means a good setting for the ending of a trilogy that had such great potential.

170,gustheaffen,Enjoyable and wrapped up the trilogy,8,5 March 2020,"I wasn't expecting the story to go this way and I thought it was pretty entertaining. At the end of the story it made sense why each movie was what it was. This was the final Glass story and if you enjoyed the acting/character in Split you'll most likely enjoy this too. I don't really want to say anything to spoil the story, I went in blind and enjoyed it a lot more than had I seen any spoilers.",Glass
171,deepfrieddodo,3 Films Deserved A Better Ending,7,17 September 2021,"First and foremost, another absolute masterclass by McEvoy, who perfectly encapsulates the many characters and host that he was playing. Likewise, Jackson and Willis picked up exactly where they left off from Unbreakable, creating the perfect atmosphere.The idea of bringing Unbreakable and Split together is brilliant and causes much excitement, and to Glass' credit it brings everything together well. The seamless transition between new and older footage and the links to every tiny detail that could have an effect make the plot outstanding. Up to a point.The addition of Paulson, as a barely-modified version of Nurse Ratched (who she later played in the needless and potentially legacy-ruining One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest spin-off) may have been necessary but certainly not welcome. It felt tired, a character for the audience to dislike without making her strong enough to hate. Unfortunately, three films come together into one climax which does not do what came before justice. Twists are Shyamalan's forte, but there were enough great ones before introducing an entirely new entity which was just lame. Really weak, really disappointing. The ending does pull everything back together for some slight satisfaction in the conclusion, but really, it deserved so much more than a whimper that no longer felt like the focal point of the films.",Glass
172,mike-c-b,A cliched mess.,1,4 June 2019,"Shyalaman had the right idea with Unbreakable and Split, and the characters living on however best they can (the definition of art itself), but went into this movie with self deprecation.The start is great - sets the premise of the film and gets you hooked. The middle is basically the same thing except everyone talks in a slow motion whisper. Particularly Sarah Paulson, who plays a one-dimensional character instead of a person. The end basically fades everything good about the whole concept of the characters and life itself away in a cliched mess. The final scenes before rolling credits are a joke with rolling patronising music.",Glass
173,CountJonnie,"Partly interesting, but mostly messy and unhinged",5,26 July 2019,"Glass is the conclusion to the Unbreakable trilogy and has an intriguing story and build up that takes a different approach to the superhero genre, and makes you and the lead actors wonder: is all this real? That premise, as well as the acting by Bruce Willis, Samuel Jackson and the amazing James McAvoy is amazing.But after a while, as can be expected with every M. Night movie after The Village, everything goes downhill. The story, the coherence, the character choises and motivations, and even the acting from Samuel Jackson and others, becomes random and uninspired. This is probably not their fault, but a result from M. Nights writing and directing. And don't have me started about the acting by Sarah Paulson and Anya Taylor Joy, who feel more misplaced than ever.The only redeeming quality is that the ending is actually interesting and offers a nice counterbalance to the colorful Marvel and DC movies. But other than that, this is simply not a well made movie. Unbreakable should have been alone ànd unique.",Glass
174,jb_campo,Disappointing due lack of action,5,15 June 2019,"Watching Glass reminded me of the first Hulk movie, which was equally disappointing. All you wanted to see was Hulk smash something, yet they kept trying to make it more complicated than that. Same with Glass. There is only one scene where the three adversaries finally take each other on, and it was disappointing at that too.There was good acting from Jackson and McAvoy and Willis, but the script disappoints. There is this mysterious lady at the insane asylum where they are housed. You keep wondering what her story is because she gave you a bit of the creeps.There was a side story with Willis's kid and Jackson's mom and that girl from the McAvoy movie, but this was supposed to focus on the 3 main characters. It failed to excite because it failed to let them fight it out more.Disappointing. Only gets a 5 from me due to the story, though McAvoy did a terrific job switching between his split personalities. Needed more Beast vs Willis.
Just a so so movie from M Night this time. Sorry.",Glass
175,WalkdenEntertainment,The Final Chapter: 19 Years In The Making...,7,18 January 2019,"19 years ago, I had the honour of seeing Unbreakable in cinemas on its opening day. The film's ending left me in awe and overall surprised.The same feelings and more occurred once I finished watching Split (again in theatres). Split left me yelling out loud and literally shaking with goosebumps when I realised what director M. Night Shyamalan did to his audience. To this day it was one of the most creative things I've ever seen in cinema. Words cannot describe how passionate I was to see Glass on its opening day and see how this series would complete and how this movie would compare to its previous instalments.To this day M. Night Shyamalan is one of my top 5 favourite directors of all time.Continuing where we last left our hero, security shop owner David (Bruce Willis) patrols the streets looking for crime and is currently on the hunt for a man who captures young girls. This man has multiple personalities (played brilliantly by James McAvoy).David soon finds himself in a mental hospital and is reunited with familiar friends... or foes. One of these familiar faces includes the man who discovered David's skills and strength, Mr Glass (Samuel L. Jackson).As far as performances go, I truly was once again blown away by both actors James McAvoy and Samuel L Jackson. While Bruce Willis is fine, I'm thankful his dialogue as a character was some what reduced. Some background characters (such as the Nurses & Security guards) are sadly the normal cliché types we've seen in films before. The strongest actors are our three leads- they're the true standouts as we've seen in previous films.From a filming perspective, M. Night Shyamalan delivers the goods, making great use of colours and film styles as we've seen in previous films. Colours in selected scenes are used to suit the film's tones (or situations) and are all done rather nicely. Colours, which the audience may not realise, are actually used in this film to build tension and suspense. I'm also happy to report the film's audio track, such as the sound effects, are awesome, but I am truly disappointed to report that the memorable James Newton Howard ""Unbreakable"" theme is sadly lacking from this film. This was a theme that featured powerfully in both previous films.As a plot (no spoilers), fans have been waiting for 19 years to witness the ultimate ending for these characters and see M. Night's vision come to an end. If you were expecting a film that is similar to Avengers... you will be disappointed. In fact, if you're expecting anything over the top with lots of big action, I feel you will once again be disappointed and this is one of my key points to consider.Similar to films such as Star Wars: The Last Jedi, I like many had an expectation as to what we thought we should see in this film. Little did I know, this film (just like The Last Jedi) was actually opposite to what I had expected.I would suggest viewers who have followed the film's franchise and shared the same hype and passion as I did towards this instalment go into your cinema session with an open mind. One thing I've learned with this Director is to simply accept that anything is possible and normally the film ending will be ultimately unpredictable.That being said, by the end of this film I considered everything we the audience invested in and watched as the finale built and I questioned if Glass delivered Finesse. It's unfortunate that I feel the third act/final moments don't quite deliver the equivalent to what the series was building towards (but damn it was close!). But! Nevertheless, Glass still has a taste of satisfaction, even though I know some will more than likely disagree me.Overall, as the credits for Glass rolled I thought to myself ""Wow what an incredible journey it has truly been thanks to the talented Director and great actors"". But as a plot, there is such so much tension built up in Glass and the final moments don't quite deliver the results I was lead to believe we were headed towards. I feel many viewers will see this film with high expectations going in, already having set in their minds what should happen in the story, but like Star Wars: The Last Jedi, viewers will be left satisfied, surprised or perhaps disappointed with its results.7.2/10

I'm trying not to spoil the movie but I feel like the ending could've happened in a different way which would've made it a bit more thrilling because I felt the actual ending was disappointing and was a bit confusing for me.

The plot was a little strung out maybe, and the ending a little weak but the acting was outstanding. James McAvoy is simply outstanding in his role, I would go so far as one of his best ever performances and Samuel L Jackson also contributes with a great Performance.It did feel a little that at the.end that maybe there wasn't the budget for the blockbuster finale that may have been planned and so it seemed a little bit of an anti climax but overall Shyamalan does deliver with great camera work and directing.",Glass
179,patriciogl10,Split is still the best of the trilogy.,7,15 October 2019,"This new entry to M. Night Shyamalan's trilogy offers once again James McAvoy's brilliant performance, that sadly seems to go a bit overlooked.
Which is probably why the film itself may have gone a bit unnoticed, since McAvoy's golden performance is the crowning point and didn't receive the credit it really deserves. The addition of Bruce Willis's David Dunn and Sam Jackson's Elijah Price certainly brings this trilogy to full circle, adding more depth to the story, without overflowing the narrative, but giving each character the right amount of interaction time in order to reach the climax without bumps in the middle.Character presence overcompensates for too much dialogue in my opinion; which of course the two should be perfectly balanced. Moments of tension are well-handled and the climax is more satisfying logically than it is exciting; although the action is correctly firm.Sarah Paulson added very little with her performance, since most of the cast is completely overshadowed by McAvoy's sublime efforts.
To be perfectly honest, I felt this film wasn't as great as I felt Split was, it lacked most of the intriguing, claustrophobic and tense parts the kept me with big eyes the whole time.It's not up to par, but it's still entertaining, and it serves to put this trilogy to end.",Glass

You can guess what happens and you are right. The normal horror cliches, million dollar equipment everywhere but not a lock or guard on the front door?It is multiple scenes like this along with an ending that made little sense and did not close out the 'trilogy'. M. Night got some of his groove back with Split and threw it all away with Glass(which referenced very little of Mr Glass).I did not like Unbreakable, but I respected its writing and direction. I like and respected Split....this one did neither....",Glass
182,darkreignn,"Loved it, until I didn't",5,18 January 2019,"Oh boy. Listen, I wasn't the biggest fan of ""Split"" (but I loved Anya Taylor-Joy, Anya I am still single so seriously I'll fly to you and take you to dinner, let me know), but after I saw the trailer for ""Glass,"" Shyamalan had me hook, line, and sinker. Sure, ""Split"" may have been one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen in my entire life that made me want to hit the ropes, but ""Glass?"" It looked exciting and intriguing, and I'd be lying if I said it wasn't. The premise of our three main characters (McAvoy, Jackson, Willis) locked in a psychiatric ward together while a doctor tries to convince them that their powers and abilities are all in their head and the result of some sort of past trauma was riveting to watch. Are they superheros? Or are they simply suffering from delusions of grandeur, just like the psychiatrist says? The film is so clever in instilling this belief inside of its characters that even you'll start to believe it; even though previously you saw these characters commit superhuman acts of incredible strength and agility, you'll still find yourself thinking, ""Well, maybe it is all in their head, maybe they aren't so special after all."" Like I said, it's fantastic viewing. Some people thought the film slows down once it gets to the asylum, but I found it consistently interesting, the conversations taking place between the characters always engaging, even if some were filled with eye-roll inducing exposition.The acting, too, was phenomenal, truly. Bruce Willis was spectacular and didn't look like he was phoning it in. Samuel L. Jackson slipped into his role and played Mr. Glass to deviant perfection, and of course McAvoy was amazing, he was amazing in ""Split"" and he's amazing here. Seeing him switch personalities and act as different people so effortlessly was incredible. It's hard enough to pretend to be one person, but pretending to be ten? I can't imagine how difficult it must've been for him, and he pulled it off again. Seriously, I really can't emphasize how fantastic McAvoy was in this film and if you are in any way on the fence about seeing this movie, I would recommend it simply because of how great he is. And yes, Anya was lovely as well. Sure, she might not be the main character this time, and she might only be in a handful of scenes, but she was good in every scene she was in. And, thank the Lord, because something I was very upset about that happened to Anya at the end of ""Split"" was remedied here (the situation with her uncle), and I was so happy that, at the least, that plot line had a happy ending. But speaking of happy endings, just like ""Split,"" ""Glass"" did not have one.Like I said in my ""Split"" review, I don't need happy endings in my films, I really don't. However, I was hoping that, after the downer ending of ""Split,"" ""Glass"" would end on more of a cheerful note. Instead, M. Night got me again, pulling the rug right out from under me and ending the film on a somehow even more depressing ending then the pitch black bleakness that ""Split"" ended on. I mean, wow. As the third act was coming to a close, I could literally feel the light and the joy and the happiness that I had acquired from watching the first two acts of this film drain out of me in a matter of seconds. I'm not kidding. Sure, there were slightly cringe inducing moments of heavy handed exposition, and sure, the action, while exciting, did feel slightly out of of place in such a grounded take on the superhero genre, but I was looking so damn far past that because of how much I was enjoying this movie, because of how good I felt watching it. The third act was winding to a close, the conclusion was coming, I was smiling, and then M. Night had to, just had to, throw a twist in there, and my smile dropped as fast as dancer's ass at a strip club. I literally couldn't believe what I was watching.The film turned into an exercise in misery. I literally looked around the theatre to make sure everyone else was seeing the same thing I was seeing. I just don't understand what M. Night was thinking. After ""Split,"" you'd think he would want a happy ending for his characters, but no, instead we get a complete cop-out, a resolution where a new plot point is introduced and just as quickly thrown away because, again, it's introduced during the final ten minutes of the movie. We get an ending that sets up an ""origin"" story, an ending that for some reason tries to expand and enlarge this cinematic universe even though the reason ""Split"" and ""Unbreakable"" worked was because they were small-scale and self-contained. M. Night force feeds us his idea of what an epic, large-scale ending should be, and he does so right after slapping us all in the face with one of the saddest and most heart wrenching finales I've seen since, well, ""Split."" I just don't get it. I know it's his movie and he can do what he wants, but damn it, give the audience something. The feelings and emotions your audience feels during the end of your film is what they're going to remember the most, and is what they're going to associate and judge your film on. When you ensure that the ending of your film is one of the saddest things in cinema history, coming completely out of nowhere with absolutely no forewarning, well, you really can't blame the audience for disliking this film then, can you?I didn't hate this movie at all. In fact, I was loving it completely until the final 15 minutes. I know we have to judge a film not based on what we wanted, but instead on what we got, and unfortunately, what we got was another bleak and depressing ending that managed to spoil the good will that the first hour and ten minutes of the movie managed to instill within me.On one hand I loved this movie, but on the other, the ending filled me with such a feeling of bleak emptiness that I cannot give this movie a higher than a 5/10. And that's what's so disappointing. Instead of following through on the promised ending, M. Night decides to throw in a twist to shock us all, without realizing that not every movie requires a twist to be satisfying.",Glass

186,FelipeCarrillo,M. Night Shyamalan hovering between hero and villain in the final chapter of his mini-universe of extraordinary beings,5,29 March 2019,"M. Night Shyamalan, who could be downright crowned as the king of the plot twists within the overall picture of modern American horror and suspense cinema, has exposed the most fearless, sterling turnabout of his entire career as a screenwriter and filmmaker; this time, unexpectedly, outside of any of his particular, ever-challenging audiovisual breakdowns on the worst of the beasts: us.To understand the most prodigious of his storytelling machinations, we have to go back in time, exactly when ""Unbreakable,"" a modest, riveting blend of drama, suspense and thriller, starring two of the most beloved movie stars of the 80's/90's, opened long before Christopher Nolan's ""Batman"" trilogy officially kicked off the modern superhero genre, this being also one of the last lucky offerings before ""The Last Airbender"" and ""After Earth"" destroyed his reputation. The filmmaker got back in shape with a small-scale yet ridiculously profitable found-footage chiller, whose climax knocked audiences sideways; ""The Visit"" put him on the map again. His following project, however, a fascinating psychological thriller titled ""Split,"" was the one that announced to the world a glorious comeback. Out of the blue, a subliminally interconnected trilogy was quietly cooking up all along, leaving clues here and there, raising, in our faces, more questions than answers the last and worst - in comparison to its predecessors - entry in the 'Shyamaluniverse' would solve.Let me be clear: Shyamalan's one of my favorite directors working right now and I will fight tooth and nail to stand up for him. My duty as a reviewer, however, must always overcome any subjective approach, any dishonest desire. But, why do I say all this? While it's true that the last act of this third installment is insanely brilliant, off-kilter, twisted, as everything surrounding the filmmaker, and cinematically fabulous, act one and two are practically a mess, a deadening pileup of weird decisions that instead of infusing new perspectives into the nowadays suffocating superhero genre, indirectly undermines the exciting plot threads and the style/artistic exercises of the two previous prequels. We're talking about Shyamalan, a name attached to both bewilderment and surprise; for better or worse, ""Glass,"" a film I followed carefully throughout the production, is not the first disappointment of the year, but it does be the most bittersweet yet entertaining ride a movie buff will have in the first two months of this new year.
There are serious issues all around the first and second act, among them the tragic absence of something the director has stood out for from the beginning. In the first acts of his best pics, the story drags a sense of restlessness, an enervating discomfort that illuminates the way for the big finale. In the second acts, tension and uncertainty reach unimaginable heights, forcing audiences to keep their breath all along the controversial climax. It's inconceivable then that the first half of ""Glass"" is a havoc of flat scenes, lacking charm and tact, soul and suspense, in very large part by defective editing.
Luke Ciarrocchi' and Blu Murray's edition work is not quite good, is horizontal and linear, and the strange style the filmmaker implanted to the story does not facilitate the task. The introduction of the three leading characters is not exciting or stylish enough to live up to the expectations of the past few months. The entrance of ""The Beast"" is a perfect picture of the above: a poorly achieved mashup of indie horror mechanics that drinks from film franchises ""Paranormal Activity,"" ""Scream"" and ""The Blair Witch Project."" The script feels inhibited to throw its most brutal features because of a commercially modified PG-13 rating, especially in The Beast's attacks and some other pivotal encounters. Some sequences, such as the indulgent, a gratuitous cameo by the director as Jai, a security guard that links all the stories of the trilogy, are deservedly disposable. In spite of trying to synchronize each story, it's no use to waste time on badly managed content.It must be said that young Charles Xavier hands down saves the entire second act to be an outright disaster. The intervention I refer to takes place halfway the feature film between Kevin Wendell Crumb and Dr. Ellie Staple in the one-color psychiatric ward, and is a masterfully performed, planned and filmed, is terrifying, ironic and impressive in unison.
James McAvoy steals the entire movie and takes, again, all the interpretative praises. Patricia, Dennis, Hedwig and some of the other cool personalities are back, who, thanks to the laborious performance of the ""Atonement"" actor, are fully credible, plausible despite his imposing physical. The actor jumping from one character to another knocks us all out, we're in front of a different person in every change. ""Split"" is still the one that treasures his tour-de-force, but McAvoy is phenomenal here leading it with a performance worthy of cult status.
With David Dunn, ageless Bruce Willis holds a well-grounded dramatic arc, with a rather than glorious conclusion and a clumsy-yet-especially interesting treatment at the expense of the ""Die Hard"" hero's great appeal. Willis remains a vigilante, an outcast, an outsider, which along with the narrative focus, allow him to exhibit not all his interpretative skills, but his most intimate acting endeavor.
At this point, it's equally unlikely to get a bad Samuel L. Jackson performance and any critic/reviewer who say so; here's an exception. The beloved actor endures a kind of fake catatonic state which recalls Michael Myers from David Gordon Green's ""Halloween"" most of the time, giving him some insufficient final minutes to show who's the man once again. It's not Jackson's anticipated showcase you're waiting for, nor the worst of all his performances, and yet, Elijah Price plays a key role as the mastermind thanks to what the actor had already built in ""Unbreakable.""
Sarah Paulson, who knows how to manage her time between film and TV, portrays Dr. Ellie Staple. One of the prime twists falls on her shoulders, which gives her the chance to transform herself wickedly, an empathy switch which may disorientate viewers, for better or worse. Her performance, stony-faced and properly calibrated, is contained, not glamorous or dramatically explosive; it's a bridge for the story to move forward.
Anya Taylor-Joy, Spencer Treat Clark and Charlayne Woodard round the cast out, with poorly developed supporting roles that disadvantage their actors' potential, especially the fierce young lady of ""The Witch.""
I guarantee you, you're not ready for the grand finale. Talking about plot twists and the last thirty minutes, personally, is pretty much the same thing. It's fascinating how it realistically blends comic book structures into storytelling, moving along within the canons of the all-time comic book proceedings. But this is Shyamalan, so you better look closer. The long-awaited showdown and its corresponding adjunct are as good as they can possibly be, bathed with powerful realism and pessimism that some fans - because this is a movie for fans - will have to think twice to swallow what just happened on screen. Likewise, its low key set-pieces, the trio of performances and the stealthy but aggressive writing moves make up a glorious, intelligent and above all human ending. And in latter lies its greatest strength. An important message is placed throughout the three films, imperative because of what's happening around us right now. The third act of ""Glass"" brings to a successful conclusion the story, with a priceless message of self-esteem and togetherness covered by a fantastic subtext that ends up being less important than the core of all these stories written by Shyamalan.""Glass"" by M. Night Shyamalan is by no means one of the filmmaker's top works. You have to see at least ""Unbreakable"" - which it's most related to - to understand everything this last installment, which should serve as an integral, standalone film such as ""Split"", tries to unpack. The film has no identity because of the strange ingredients it mixes up to prove it's unlike the other superhero flicks out there; it's neither a thriller, a fantasy/drama nor a suspense pic, it's all of them at once, a terrible phenomenon coming from a lazy, flat and cinematic energy-free first act. Aesthetically, it doesn't stand out; yes, it's not a big-budget production, but Chris Trujillo's production design and Mike Gioulakis' peculiar cinematography doesn't fit in with each other or the most groundbreaking genre incursions. On the upside, the movie's saved by James McAvoy, who's superb as Kevin and all his personalities once again, a slightly exciting score by West Dylan Thordson - who blatantly borrows ""Split"" compositions, - a commendable, delicate resolution by Shyamalan and a third act so well executed that it'll surely leave you speechless, something that, in one way or another, the filmmaker keeps doing masterfully.",Glass
187,TheVictoriousV,"My ""split"" thoughts and theory about the Shyamalan universe",5,27 January 2019,"Surely the biggest problem with Glass is that its very being (as well as this sentence) ruins the surprise ending of Split? The latter film, by M. Night Shyamalan, seemed at first like a decent stand-alone thriller with no Shyamalan twist in particular, until the final few seconds revealed that it does, in fact, take place in the same universe as Unbreakable, his attempt at grounded superhero film from 2000 and arguably one of his best!Yes, Shyamalan was making his own ""shared superhero universe"" series, and it was charming that, in a world of hype culture where everyone knows or speculates about everything, his way of announcing a Cinematic Universe was one of mystery and surprise. But alas, the third movie is out and its marketing tells us up-front that we shall see James McAvoy's ""Horde"" meet up with David ""Unbreakable"" Dunn (a mostly sleepwalking Bruce Willis) and his comic-obsessed nemesis Elijah, aka Mr. Glass (Samuel L. Jackson).Glass is a movie that stands out in its thematically significant use of color (notice the sets and costumes) and otherwise interesting art direction, but this one makes it all the more clear that the initial screenplay for Split was written by pre-Village Shyamalan. The plot shows Kevin (McAvoy) being committed alongside Dunn, because surely they must be mad to claim that they can shift into widly different personas (one of them a horrid Beast) and withstand all damage, respectively? With them is the fragile, wheelchair-bound Mr. Glass, locked in because of what he did in Unbreakable. Should I reveal that too? Maybe not.Anya Taylor-Joy (an up-and-coming Scream Queen with some of the best damn eyes in the business) is also back, David's son (Spencer Treat Clark) runs a crime-fighting business with his father as the film starts, Charlayne Woodard reprises Elijah's mother, and Sarah Paulson plays the doctor who oversees the three central anomalies. Don't forget about Shyamalan's mandatory Hitchcock-style cameo. Or, should that be ""Stan Lee-style"" now?The acting ranges from ""good"" to ""not very"" (the show-stealer being McAvoy in the dozens of personas he assumes), yet the writing of a more modern-day M. Night than he who wrote Split makes this irrelevant. Few performers could make his idea of human interaction seem wholly natural.Is Glass entirely worthless, though? Far from it. Shyamalan's knack for creative shots and unsettling atmosphere are intact and there is at times acting to admire. It's just that Glass also has contrived plot conveniences a plenty (the hospital is remarkably understaffed when it needs to be and the twist makes us question why certain characters are explicitly allowed to walk the Earth without receiving a Rick Dicker treatment), tonal issues, and clunky expository dialogue. It is clever that Shyamalan's addition to the Superhero Universe trend is as self-aware and meta as any sequel to Unbreakable should be, but all that stuff can get trite as well.The obvious joke is that I didn't expect the film to have me so split. I'm going to categorize this as a negative review for now, but I do think this is your most interesting option of the January season. There aren't many like Shyamalan.FAN THEORY ADDENDUM: Me and my theatre companions agreed, before the film started, on the possibility that actually ALL Shyamalan movies share the same universe. At the start Bruce Willis was dead, only to be revived as one of the aliens from Signs, hence his one weak spot and baldness. At some point in the future, he shall ironically fall in love with the Lady in the Water and team up to fight the Tartutics, who answer to the trees from The Happening, which are about to bring the apocalypse seen in After Earth. This is all orchestrated by the Signs aliens, who also created the Urzah, to get the humans away from their harmful water world and into a vulnerable positions.

188,jackgdemoss,"A disappointing setup for future films, that failed to capitalize on its phenomenal predecessor Split",7,30 January 2019,"I was disappointed by Glass considering it is a sequel to one of my favorite films, Split. I appreciate its ability to stick to a theme and I rather enjoy the theme, however, it has a knack for leaving the viewer unsatisfied with each character altercation and plot point. Never was there a time where I thought that a twist was well-crafted. The only redeeming quality of Glass, albeit an extremely potent one, is James McAvoy's once again brilliant performance as The Horde. For this film to be worth watching at all, I recommend you watch Unbreakable and Split first. To most viewers, I would advise leaving both Unbreakable and Glass alone, and advise them to watch Split as a standalone film.",Glass

190,Gresh854,A Fair Conclusion To Shyamalan's Once Secret Trilogy,5,24 January 2019,"Time to break down M. Night Shyamalan's, Glass.The Shyamagold:
DIRECTING. CAMERAWORK. NEATO. Yes, you can genuinely tell the dude has improved in his aptness to capture idiosyncratic optics in his sequences. Tons of favorable camerawork techniques were utilized to its fullest potential in here.The first 15-20 minutes. Ravishing.The action was, shockingly, action-y.The moderate pace that mimicks Unbreakable's steady velocity.James McAvoy (x24).Samuel Jackson (x1).West Dylan Thordson's score. Do yourselves a favor and listen to ""Physicks"".Mr. Glass's buoyant s-t-y-l-e.Utilizing deleted scenes from Unbreakable.The ending's motif, conclusion, and wrathfully emotional punch. It's going to ""split"" audiences for sure, however. Sorry.The Shyamabull:
I hate saying this, but, Sarah Paulson's character and her eventual ""twist"" reveal. Also, her end goal(s).25% of the dialogue, again.The filmmakers forgot to wake up Bruce Willis and write him a good part.About 4/5 of the twists.The absence of logic. Example: Only one guard on shift? WHAT?The ending's painfully optimistic final shot. The movie's wrap-up was doing so tip-top up until then.By the end of the whole enigma, you're kind of left with a tame taste in your mouth. Like an, ""Okay, that happened. Swell?"" sort of feeling.Daryl, the guard.The Kajillion Shyamalanian Twists (SPOILER ALERT):
Mr. Glass had a master plan, and another one, and another one, and...The ""supers"" are ""super"", unlike what the second act of this movie was trying to make you think through Dr. Ellie Staple's character. Sarah Paulson was about to make you believe that they were crazy all along. Fake news.Mr. Glass killed Kevin's dad. I...guess?The secret society stuff is just dispensably nonsensical.All the ""supers"" die (this is the only ""twist"" I found to be stupendous because it doesn't play out like any ordinary ""twist"").Mr. Glass filmed his, David's, and Kevin's battle/fate and uploaded it to the internet. Of course.Critics would have you suspecting that M. Night Shyamalan's, Glass, is complete, madcapped rubbish (37% on Rotten Tomatoes, 42% on Metacritic). To me, it's honestly a fitting ending to his once undisclosed superhero trilogy-yes, I legitimentally dug a majority of the finale. It's a bit tangled in terms of its story coherence, but I admire how Shyamalan harkens back to his tones of, Unbreakable, while also providing a fair sequel to, Split. Solid trilogy indubitably. Also, thank you once more, McAvoy, for existing among us mortals. (Verdict: C+)",Glass
191,virindra,"Very intense, again.",10,22 January 2019,"1 I read a lot of reviews before I went to see this movie and I must say I don't agree with all of them. I do agree with the statement I you liked the previous two movies, you will probably will like this one. I liked the previous two movies a lot.

3 The movie builds up very slow and that worked just fine for me. I liked it very much that the original cast came together in this movie. The movie is very intense and comes to a surprising climax at the end.

5 The character Glass has a parallel meaning to Manoj in real life. His name is Mr. Night Shyamalan. If it wasn't for Mr. Glass the hero and the villain were not born. If it wasn't for him Bruce Willis was not the hero in this movie and James McAvoy would not have the role of his life where most actors dream of.

There was someone who wrote in a review that this movie does not just to the people who really have the disorder of the person that McAvoy plays. Well in that case I advise people to rate the x-men movies very low, because these movies do not just to mutants.I am sad because this is the last mopvie in the trilogy. I taught that Manoj could not live up to Unbreakable when he made Split and I taught that he could not live up to Split when he made Glass. I was wrong.",Glass

193,tfminfl,Glass was Great!,10,2 February 2019,"308. Glass. I really enjoyed it! Sure McAvoys' 20 split personalities got more screen time than the title character and David Dunns' combined, but lets face it, they were cool. And the best part of seeing any film with Sam Jackson in it is, what the hell are they gonna do to his hair in this one!! So after the events of Unbreakable and Split, our characters, Mr Glass, The Overseer, and Kevin Wendell Crumb (+19) find themselves in a mental facility being treated by 'Someone's at the door', Dr Staple, who specializes in deprogramming people who think they're superheros. And while she's off treating Crumbs multiples or Dunn, Mr Glass has been heavily sedated for the past decade or so, and hasn't been up too a whole lot (except we find out, that meanwhile in his own head he plays out this scenario where he is like this special agent, recruiting people with special powers, culminating into a plot extremely similar to his current situation with a lot less flair) But we know Elijah better than that, he's planning something huge, but is something diabolical working against him at the same time, or does he know that something diabolical is also going on, and so on and so forth...

194,PetarNeo,An there it goes!,8,20 January 2019,"2000 to 2019 is a long period of time but finally we get a trilogy that will be watched for generations to come. It is a quite journey to go through considering how much it took to make this kind of universe. M. Night brings us final chapter and you should go open minded to the movie because it will bring you another view into all this.
Split was a great introduction of Horde and his capabilities but now you get to see it all when all of three masterful characters meet. Glass offers you probably everything you want to see, from mystery, thriller, action and twist if it can be called that. The best way to enjoy Glass and all it's tricks and routes that it takes is just to sit and watch the story unfolds but even if you have ideas about how its going you are probably going to Love or you won't depending on your level of anticipation.
M. Night brings us lovely character of Mr. Glass (Samuel L. Jackson) which will leave you quite fascinated how he pulls it off. Horde (James McAvoy) is absolutely magnificent and proves to be an actor with magnificent performance. Sarah Paulson as Dr. Staple was something that you will appreciate because she is tough, convincing and after all myserious. It seems like David Dunn (Bruce Willis) should have something bigger to show us all but in final version of movie feels like it left us wondering more about him.
Movie is beautifully shot with some pretty amazing scenes showing us skill of M. Night and his dedication to movie. Believing it was his passion project to do this nobody can argue he didn't do good job but third act of the movie might throw you into hatred or appreciation of his work.
After watching the movie you will be left with a lot of questions, but then can you be sure this is the last movie? 3/4",Glass
195,Lewis_Heather787,Best of the Trilogy!,8,18 January 2019,"The final chapter of a very strange, long winded and loosely connected trilogy of films has finally arrived from M. Night Shyamalan. Personally I've had mixed feelings about the previous two entries in this franchise. I thought that ""Unbreakable"" was ok, I just didn't connect to the story or the characters that much so it didn't have that much of an impact on me really. Its much loved by some but not me unfortunately. However I was much more interested and keen on ""Split"", which I actually really enjoyed because the story and the characters were interesting.So now we have ""Glass"" and for me it is the best film of the three of them, I was shocked at how much I enjoyed this film and was pleasantly surprised by it.Firstly the four main performances of the film are really really good. Its no suprise to say that James McAvoy is sublime again as Kevin Wendell Crumb and the 23 personalities that go with him. He was incredibly good in ""Split"" and this has only continued into this film. Its the way he can seamlessly jump from one personality to another within seconds, maybe its clever editing, with all of them feeling so genuine. Incredibly creepy but McAvoy is at the top of his game, probably his best performance of his career. The other main highlight I would have to say is Sarah Paulson who plays Dr Staple. She pulls of the biggest trick of the entire film, suggesting and presenting herself as trying to save the three men but actually works for some secret society that actually wants to eradicated them. Paulson pulls it off spectacularly, either you will buy into this part of the film or not, and it will probably have an effect on your viewing experience.Now you may think I said there were ""Four"" main performances that were really really good in this film and I've only mentioned two of them. You are correct, McAvoy and Paulson for me were the standouts of the film. The other two actors, you guess it, Samuel L Jackson and Bruce Willis are the other two, they are also really good but...............they don't do that much really. Their roles are limiting to say the least, but when they are on screen there just as good as they were in ""Unbreakable"" but I was wanting a bit more........thats just me.As sort of mentioned the twist with Sarah Paulson's character is a really interesting one that I didn't see coming, mainly due to the really believably performance of Paulson. Its an interesting concept and one that ultimately failed but interesting none the less.Overall this film is 80% out of 100 or 8 out of 10 its a very good film and the best in the trilogy for me. I am shocked that am saying that because to be honest I wasn't to bothered about seeing this film. However I would say that this film is not for everyone, there will be a lot of people leaving this film absolutely hating it, I completely understand why. You have to immediately buy into the concept of the film and the characters otherwise you will probably find this film laughable for the wrong reasons.",Glass
196,Eli_Elvis,What a wasted opportunity.,1,4 April 2019,Been waiting for a sequel for over almost 20 years and this is what you deliver? A decade of gaining fans trust back all to squander it for a static slow character study? Nobody cares about your trick endings man.,Glass

198,mr_bickle_the_pickle,This movie does not shatter on arrival,8,21 January 2019,"Going into this film I had seen a lot of reviews that were basically ""I liked where it was going until the 3rd act. I was so disappointed in the ending"" etc. I do not feel the sentiment at all. I get it might be sad to have these characters die. I get its not the traditional way for a superhero movie to end. But this has never been a traditional superhero story. As Glass says towards the end ""This is an origin story"". Its not a David's story, its not Kevin's story...its the world's story. Because now we know superheroes are real. Its the origin story for all those people who thought they were special and now know they are. I thought it was totally clever. I thought it even wrapped up nicely with the ""sidekicks"" at the train station. It was a nice full circle moment considering their destinies were brought together by a train.That being said, its not a perfect film. I did find the timeline was a little confusing to follow. Not just because it would sometimes jump to flashbacks and back to the present. But this also is supposed to happen within 2-3 days and yet feels like its more a week. Glass and The Beast seem to escape really early ( like David's still stuck in his room, and Ellie (Sarah Paulsen) hasnt arrived to work even, and yet they they end up catching up to them/action pretty quickly. And again, I know that Glass never actually planned to make it to the tower. And so maybe he wasting time, but its never really clear and it seems like if this were the real world, they would have had a lot of time to escape. *Shrugs*.I have other minor nitpicks. The secret organization was a little cheesy. It does make some sense storywise, but I think M Night could have come to same conclusion in a different way. The make-up job for Mrs Price, was horrendous. I didn't like the go-pro type of camera work for the action scenes. But overall, I was enthralled with the story.",Glass

Could have done so much with these 2 iconic characters coming together but it's just terrible, in the middle of the film about 70 mins go by and nothing happens, literally nothing happens. Definitely the worst film I have seen in the cinema probably ever. Do not waste your money",Glass
200,AdrenalinDragon,Shattered pieces of Glass with both greatness and weakness,7,18 January 2019,"Unbreakable is one of the very best movies ever made, and Split was a decent follow up. M. Night Shyamalan seemed like he was back in good form. What more could I have hoped for a decent sequel/conclusion to both movies? Did Glass live up to the hype? In some ways, yes and no. I don't know if I can consider it a masterpiece, but there are alot of things I really loved in it, and things that didn't work for me in this conclusion of a trilogy.To start things off, Glass has barely any action in it. This is a grounded Superhero movie, which is a fresh piece of air to where we live in a world where Marvel and DC Superhero movies come out non-stop and rely entirely on action. Glass has action, but it's very simplistic and a small part of the film. Similar to
both Unbreakable and Split, M. Night focuses on the characters and the themes of living in a world where these powers are grounded and people coming to gripes with them. Glass brings the characters from both Unbreakable and Split together to connect them to the premise of the film and throughout the large chunk of it being set in a Psychiatric Hospital, we feel the characters and how they connect with the themes and premise of the film.Of course, things can't be as straightforward as usual for an M. Night movie. There are twists and turns throughout, and some decisions will leave both people annoyed and surprised at how M. Night plays with our expectations and leaning onto doing things differently. The pacing of the movie is slow, and anyone expecting stuff to happen every 5 minutes are going to be letdown. Pretty much all the performances from the characters are great. James McAvoy and Samuel L. Jackson are the lead characters, and Bruce Willis surprisingly isn't in much of the movie, and a new character played by Sarah Paulson who has good things and bad things going for her.Other side characters are also present in Glass. Spencer Treat Clark who
played David Dunn's son in Unbreakable is now grown up and helps his dad.
Anya Taylor-Joy from Split is back to interact with Kevin Crumb, and finally
Charlayne Woodard as Mr. Glass' mother. They all don't feel like being thrown
in there for no reason and are actually written into the plot and conclusion of
the film pretty well. Glass also uses flashbacks from both Unbreakable and Split
effectively, with some even being brand new footage never seen before. The score is good, but I really wished James Newton Howard's Unbreakable score was used. I felt like this was a missed opportunity. Maybe M. Night couldn't get the rights?Overall, I feel Glass is being underrated by the Critics. It's not a perfect movie
and easily the weakest of the trilogy for me, but it feels like M. Night was trying hard to connect the movies together and give us a decent and surprising conclusion. There were many cool ideas in the movie and although some of it didn't work for me, which I won't spoil and some of it will be down to personal taste, there's no denying Glass is a fresh take on the Superhero genre. I gotta give M. Night credit for taking risks with this movie. Maybe on another watch I'll like it more. Who knows?7/10",Glass
201,baywoodarborist,Different,8,21 August 2020,This film tackles superness differently than other films in the past. The father son relationship was a nice part pushing the father to believe in himself. This film was a pleasant surprise.,Glass
202,donttouchmeprimate,"I understand why some don't like it, but...",7,5 April 2019,"It's actually pretty darn good.
I won't drone on so I'll just cover a few points.
It's a good story, makes sense, and everything fits together, and if you're a movie fan, thats something that is worth its weight in Jewish gold.Although there were a couple of things that I didn't particularly enjoy.
1. The action scenes, not really ""actiony"" or filmed very well, a couple of shots are good but they're for story telling and not for the enjoyment of watching something cool.
2. The ending is a bit frustrating when we've waited 20 years to get to this point with two previous installments that are great.Having said that, I'd suggest not getting too upset over how certain things pan out and just enjoy the ride.Subscribe to Pewdiepie. T-Series sucks.",Glass
203,TuesdayThe17th,An intimate and effective ending to a great trilogy,9,17 April 2019,"As a big fan of Unbreakable and a liker of Split, I found Glass to be a very intimate and effective closing to the trilogy. Even tho I dont even like James McAvoy's character that much, his acting is what would be considered phenomenal. Unbreakable truly moved me when I saw it for the first time at age 12, so this movie brought a few tears to my eyes. This is a well crafted comic book thriller set in a very personal universe of M. Night's. I'm excited to see what he does next now that he got this out of his system. I hope he does a horror film next. 9/10",Glass
204,peeedeee-94281,Glass Wasn't Unbreakable.,4,23 January 2019,"A lot of people have written about what disappointed them about this movie, and I agree. It was such a wasted opportunity to bring together the three characters. I guess the final words of Glass about it just being an 'origins story' was the cop-out answer by M Night. It doesn't appear to be a set up for further 'super hero' movies, especially if the response to this movie was so poor.
This movie seriously lacked any momentum. M Night expects the audience to already be familiar with everyone and their back story, so we are treated to all of them sitting around in a psychiatric hospital for 1.5hrs. The doctor was annoying, and dull.
Okay, so if these guys were so dangerous, why was there only ONE guy to keep an eye on them at night? And when that guy took his sweet time getting to his shift, there was literally NO ONE watching them?!
And that ending, how is uploading the video going to change anything? Everyone's watched movies, we all know about CGI, so wouldn't people watching this just think it was another CGI project?
A real disappointment, I really had high hopes for M Night S and his return to top form with Split. I guess now that everyone knows who is in Glass, the twist in Split has essentially been ruined for everyone who still hadn't seen it lol.
As for the acting, it was all pretty dull. Even McAvoy was just too much. I mean, less is more. In Split, you only saw a fraction of the personalities. In this movie, he becomes more of a sideshow circus freak, with The Beast coming out willy nilly, rather than having real purpose like Split.
Feel free to skip this movie.",Glass
205,scb_coldsteel,"Not a bad movie, but substantially weaker than the parts that went into it!",6,18 January 2019,"So I saw Glass as the theater. I won't lie, I was excited about this movie. M Night Shyamalan has had a rocky career, but I thoroughly enjoyed Split and Unbreakable is one of my favorites he has done. So of course I was excited at the prospect of combining two unique and genre defining roles into one movie. Unfortunately Glass is a case where adding two interesting concepts creates a film that is less than its individual parts.The beginning of Glass starts not too long after the end of Split. James Mcavoy's madcap character is on prowl for more victims to feed his Beast persona. Of course Bruce Willis now known as the vigilante the Overseer is on his trail to save the day. Their initial comic book set up confrontation only serves as a plot device to push the narrative along as both are arrested and housed in the same psychiatric treatment facility for delusions of grandeur along with Samuel L Jackson. From there the film plays upon traditional superhero tropes and viewer expectations all the while incorporating a number of M Night Shyamalan's signature twists. This in no way is a traditional superhero story as you would expect from M Night Shyamalan and very much tells a unique, but at times convoluted story.Glass did do a number of things as a film that I enjoyed. Similar to Unbreakable it took traditional superhero tropes and turned them on their heads. The film is incredibly self-aware and frequently it is obvious that M Night Shyamalan is purposely building up your expectations of what will occur based upon traditional superhero mythos. The movie constantly tries to misdirected its narrative to leave you guessing as to what will come next.Their is also something incredibly interesting about the concept of movie. Superheros and villains may saturate the market, but Glass is in no way a tradition comic book film. In a lot of ways it acts as an anti-Disney style rebuttal to the way they makes films. It's dark, depressing, violent, and does not tell a happy-go-lucky family-friendly comic book movie. It certainly will be a polarizing film with its unorthodox and bleak storytelling.I will say I liked all the actors performances as well. You absolutely have to have seen and enjoyed Split and Unbreakable to appreciate their roles. John McAvoy, Bruce Willis, and Samuel L Jackson all pick up exactly from their last films. It was fun seeing them interact with each other and build upon the world of M Night Shyamalan's comic book universe. Plus bonus points for including Spencer Clark in the cast allowing him to reprise his role as Bruce Willis's son 19 years after Unbreakable.While I did find myself enjoying parts of the film, there were also a number of aspects that really hurt the overall quality of the viewing experience. First the pacing and story arc structure of the film were completely off. The initial buildup of the narrative was brought to a snail's pace with a boring and overly long second act. Plus the grand reveal in the third act just felt weak and convoluted in the face of so many unnecessary twists.There are times were you will certainly ask yourself what is going on in this movie and precisely what story is M Night Shyamalan trying to tell. While this isn't always a problem it becomes one when the twists he is known for take over the actual storytelling of the film. The multiple grand twists of the movie felt unnecessary and detracted from the overall experience.Similar to past failures the twists were supposed to shock, but came access far more as lazy storytelling. No one appreciates a deus ex machina style ending and yet we see that twice in the film. It wasn't interesting storytelling and completely dropped the ball in telling a coherent story.Glass ultimately ignored the best aspects of its origin films and made a movie no one was really asking for. The slow character-driven drama and human emotion from Unbreakable is completely devoid in Glass. In the same regard the psychological horror and suspense we see from Split is thrown out the window. Everything that made those two concepts interesting and compelling was ignored.Glass's steep learning curve also really hurt the film in the end. While Unbreakable and Split told complex stories filled with interesting characters and situations Glass feels far more shallow and empty. None of the returning characters had any of the emotional depth and really never made me feel invested in the characters or their conflicts. Even aspects of past characters that worked in the previous films felt flat here. McAvoy and his frantic and manic performance while entertaining, became particularly one-dimensional at times.Finally the film really didn't do a good job in regard to action or suspence. As I said before all of the suspence and horror elements from Spilt have been removed. The initial buildup of the film fell completely flat and never recovered. Action and fight scenes wise the movie really did nothing great either. You would think since M Night Shyamalan abandoned the character development, drama, and suspense of previous films to focus on a more action orientated story the fight scenes and choreography would have been mapped out better.Overall I did enjoy Glass, but I had substantially higher hopes for the film. Unbreakable and Split really delivered unique experiences and Glass just seemed to continue the least interesting aspects of those films to tell a story no one asked for. While Glass did have an interesting concept it was greatly weighted down by uneven pacing issues and weak storytelling. It certainly wasn't Lady in the Water, The Happening, or The Village but it by no means is the equal of the parts that went into the film's creation. A 6 out of 10.",Glass

209,RhapsodyReviews,Not as Good as Its Predecessors.,6,17 November 2019,"Review:
'Glass' is a psychological-thriller film directed by M. Night Shyamalan. It is a crossover and sequel to Shyamalan's previous films 'Unbreakable' (2000) and 'Split' (2016), serving as the final installment in the 'Unbreakable' trilogy.
I'm going to try my hardest to keep all spoilers out of this review, but I do need to say that this particular movie is a hard one to review with having any to tread carefully.
In a series of escalating encounters, former security guard David Dunn uses his supernatural abilities to track Kevin Wendell Crumb, a disturbed man who has twenty-four personalities. Meanwhile, the shadowy presence of Elijah Price emerges as an orchestrator who holds secrets critical to both men.
Where this movie really shines is the acting, primarily James McAvoy. It's great to see Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson reprising their roles as David Dunn and Mr. Glass. As I mentioned in my review for Split James McAvoy was robbed of an Oscar nomination for his performance in that movie and he was the star of the show in this film once again. I haven't seen Bruce Willis like he was in this movie in a long time, and it shows that he cares about this character. I absolutely hated Sarah Paulson in this movie, I know you're not supposed to like the character she plays per say, but she didn't fit in with this cast at all and her acting was definitely not up to par.
The first and second acts of this movie were pretty good for the most part. The first act focuses on David Dunn and what he has been up to since we last saw him in Unbreakable. The second act was more about Kevin a.k.a The Hord and we see more personalities that we didn't get to see in Split, and it shows how he can be controlled while in the hospital. Now as for the third act, which is supposed to be the ultimate finale of this built up trilogy fell flat, and the film got rather boring for me. Mr. Glass, our title character, didn't even speak or do anything until we were over an hour into the film. While they were in the institution David Dunn was basically forgotten about to the institution David Dunn was basically forgotten about to the point where I almost forgot he was completely in the movie. Although I do like some parts of the third act, the last 25 minutes really tanked, and left me utterly frustrated. The way the arcs of these three characters end is insulting to me especially David Dunn. No spoilers, like I said, but if you see the movie, you'll understand what I'm talking about. There is one big reveal that I liked but beyond that, this film's ending was a huge misfire.
Overall, this movie wasn't an outright bad movie. It's super frustrating how it had all of this build up over two amazing film and this is the end we are left with. Glass was a very disappointing ending to an otherwise brilliant film. Not a lot of people will be happy with this review and that's fine. Like Vince Vaughn says in Couple Retreat. ""I know my truth"".

Although there was a slight clue at the end of Split in the Diner.Let me start by saying this is better than Split in my opinion and it did a good job of dotting i's and crossing the t's - i had no idea of the comic book background or superhero sub plot but all was explained in this concluding part of the trilogy and that helped explain a lot to someone not particularly aware of the genre .The stand out performance here was once again James McAvoy - but both Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson were both powerful - and a great supporting cast .This will definitely make you want to go back and revisit Split and Unbreakable to see what it was that you missed now you know where all the clues were leading .M Knight Shy..... has a particular style and this one didn't disappoint so always expect the unexpected.A good finalePad.A 7/10,Glass
211,MickeyTheConstant,A bit disappointing,6,12 June 2019,I enjoyed Unbreakable and thought Split was excellent so was really looking forward to this. Unfortunately though it was just a bit flat and disappointing. Great performance from McAvoy as in Split and Jackson was good too. Just not enough actionor suspense really. The ending didn't feel right either. Just felt like it was going through the motions at times. It seemed as if the director didn't really have a definitive plot for his third movie and just did it anyway. Too much repetitiveness also. Fight scenes were boring and no matter how good McAvoy was as his character it just seemed to be too much of him changing personalities. Really missed the boat on this one as it had so much potential. Disappointing,Glass
212,Fields201,Glass is a Blast!,8,20 January 2019,"I was eagerly awaiting this movie since Split. I wanted to see Bruce Willis go up against James Macavoy's Beast and you get just that and then some. Honestly, I think this is M. Knight Shylamananan's however you spell his name's best movie since.... well, Split but before it was a long time. Well, I did like The Visit. However, like all of his films, there's plenty of flaws to be had.The movie starts out with James Macavoy's split personality Patricia in front of these girls he has hostage and then we get to the credits. I was surprised to see James Macavoy's name first on the credits. Bruce Willis was in second. In fact, Bruce Willis's David Dunn starts off the film as The Overseerer beating up guys who uses The Superman Punch and unites with his adult son in tracking down James Macavoy's character Kevin Wendell Crumb with the use of security systems. We get his backstory and right in the beginning of the film, there's a fight between Willis and Macavoy! Now we're talking! Then they get caught and sent to a psychiatric ward and this is where the rest of the film takes place.I figured out why Bruce Willis's name is second on the credits. He gets shafted for most of the film. In fact, I forgot he was in the film at some points. Seriously, when he shows up, I'm like, ""Oh yeah, I forgot about him!"" Samuel L Jackson's Mr. Glass shows up halfway through the film and doesn't speak to pretty much the third act.Then I started asking questions like why is there one guard that comes in to feed them or whatever and nobody standing patrol. If these guy are so dangerous, why weren't precautions being made? Besides mutual abuse, why was Casey Cooke bonding with Kevin Crumb after the atrocities from Split? She's really hot, by the way.And yeah, I also had a problem with the climax of the film. They build this location up but they don't ever get there. I'm not sure if this is budget reason or what, but it was a little jarring that this was made into a big deal and it never happens. Also it did drag for awhile and went happens to the characters felt very anti-climatic. I mean, for all of them. It was like they had to rush production or something.Despite that, I enjoyed the whole film and I plan to see it again soon. James Macavoy steals every scene he's in, Bruce Willis actually looked invested, and Samuel L Jackson is... well Samuel L Jackson and I can't ask for anything more. It's a fun film even if it doesn't feel quite complete. Also, was I the only one asking why nobody flashed lights at the beast when they were going up against him when its the most effective way?",Glass
213,arabnikita,"If you liked Unbrakable and Split, you will enjoy this one too",7,16 January 2019,"This is not a superhero movie or an action packed sci-fi flick, this is a psychological thriller with people having supernatural abilities...or do they really have these abilities and are they really supernatural?? Just like in Unbreakable and Split, you will have your doubts and theories but in the end it all ends up going in another direction and then another one.M. Night Shyamalan tries his best to keep the movie closer to real life than to fiction by essentially eliminating special effects or any kind of CGI. Keeping a steady pace from the opening scenes until the credits, he fills the movie with clever dialogues that bridge the gap between the three movies and adds gritty action to keep the audience engaged. Overall, this fuses into a picture with a 2000s Old School feel about it that cant be seen in too many movies nowadays.James McAvoy is absolutely incredible in his transitioning between different personalities which happens a lot more than in Split. Sarah Paulson brings a new character and Sam Jackson with Bruce step right back into their old shoes. Cinematography is solid with an effective use of colors and in the music department Shyamalan took a page out of Nolan's last movie. M. Night is a 50/50 director and this movie lands on the good side with a couple of twists at the end that make you wonder if this is the end or just the beginning.Watch both Unbreakable and Split and if you enjoy them then go for this one. The movie wont make sense if you dont see the previous two.movies.shmovies on instagram",Glass
214,mirwais-orbit,Shyamalan desperately needs help,3,27 November 2019,"This movie is so frustrating and disappointing that is sad.Shyamalan stated that Glass is the final part of a trilogy imagined after some concepts for Unbreakable have had to be put aside. And conflicts between studios and lack of positive ratings regarding his movies after that postponed the idea indefinitely.He also defines Glass as the first real adult superhero movie to hit theaters since the raise of popularity of this genre, but he's completely wrong about it. First because the fantastic elements he uses and his original concepts about the story itself doesn't lead neither story or characters to a mature appeal. Logan, for example, uses basically the same tragic elements, but James Mangold succeds when distancing the story from the universe it is set, creating a parallel one that works effectively with a consistent plot, action sequences, valuable drama elements and pinches of metacriticism about how far heroes can go in the genre itself. And even though Shyamalan tries hard to develop similar issues, he never achieves a higher level.The thing is that problems start when Shyamalan oversaturates the story with unecessary things. A recurring problem on his writing already pinned not only by critics, but also by audience in general.Split is interesting until audience feels completely lost between Kevin's 9 different personalities, questioning the true relevance of that, also getting to know later that there are a dozen more the movie hadn't time to show. Because, you know, 3 or 4 wouldn't be enough.Instead of beying a movie to extend McAvoy's talent, in fact was a particular freak show. Not that McAvoy wasn't able to handle it by his own merits, but because Shyamalan's overuse of fantastic elements overshadowed every single element that could make the movie a relevant back to form to a director's career filled with bad choices over the years.Now, once again, the story is interesting, and the plot was promissing after the cliffhanger ending of last movie, but the whole process was underdone. For a trilogy that he stated to be developing for over a decade, the feeling is that he made up everything in the last minute.First of all, screenplay never develops a dramatic arc effectively. It's always bland and superficial. No consistent conflicts, no relevant dialogs. There's no compelling narrative at all. Just a bunch of characters imprisioned, trapped on their own flashbacks over and over to remember audience who they are instead of put their very own abilities to test and how that could impact within a whole system for real, and not just theoretically as screeplay does.Characters are arrested by someone that wants to convince them all the time that they are a product of their own mind, and also an effortless disservice when trying to convince us that what we've seen so far on previous movies was just a delusion. And entire movie keeps the same tone until the final act. What a waste.The acting also reflects director's inability to convice them to take their individual roles seriously. Willis seems to be just doing a favor to an old friend in need; Jackson's ""is-but-isn't-there"" situation is like a bad joke; Paulson is just doing her job, no hard commitment; Anya Taylor-Joy... I don't even know why her character is back, maybe just to say: ""Hey, everyone! I have Stockholm Syndrome and I'm proud of it!"".Shyamalan wasn't satisfied to split his character into twenty-F-something personalities. He was so unsatisfied to a point that - and I don't know how he managed that - he also succeeds splitting those ones that already exists. When Beast has his redeeming moment after some truths come to surface was like there wasn't any more cards to play, so Shyamalan just turned the table upside down. The plot twist was so predictable that, if that was supposed to be tragic, well, it fails badly.And that Shyamalan's traditional way to uncover the true-truth is so overdone that is outrageous.And I will end this with a special comment about the ""incredible"" one responsible for that monstrosity on Charlayne Woodard's face that anyone should dare call it a make up.Hopefully this small universe Shyamalan created in the last minute didn't last longer than a couple hours.",Glass

There are a lot of stories and characters into one movie, but Samuel L. Jackson did play his part so well, though, and I enjoyed every scene he was in. The filmmaker delivers an exceedingly strong opening half hour that picks right up with Willis' memorable ""Unbreakable"" character and he does what he can to put together two tonally different tales, but the results is not always good. The truth is that I was really expecting more from ""Glass,"" and I didn't get it. But for those intrigued but not anticipating too much, it's the sort of movie that can be a fan one.

224,EddyTheMartian007,A Flawed Masterpiece (No Spoilers Review),6,22 January 2019,"Glass... I'm really conflicted about this movie. I definitely liked it, and I think M. Night Shyamalan has some hints of genius, but the movie it self does have some big issues.The technical aspects of the film are of course excellent. I loved the unique use of lighting for each character and setting. I think the set design was very nice. Cinematography is once again superb. I do have to say I was disappointed with the score from West Dylan Thordson. I wish they would've included more of the previous themes, and while I think the score is good enough, I especially liked when he used ticking, it just wasn't as good as Unbreakable.The cast is great for the most part. Once again James McAvoy gives an extraordinary performance as the 24 different personalities that inhabit The Hoard. Woah he's just phenomenal, the way he goes from personality to personality. You could tell exactly which personality he was playing just by his voice or mannerisms, he's truly one of the greatest actors alive this day. Samuel L. Jackson is also fantastic as Mr. Glass, I just want to see more of this character. Unfortunately I don't think Bruce Willis as David Dunn was that good. It's definitely one of his better recent performances, but he's not nearly as good as he used to be. He wasn't bad, but he wasn't great. Sarah Paulson as Dr. Ellie Staple was really good. There was a scene near the end in particular which I though she did really well. All the side characters who get surprisingly a lot of screen time are all good. Anya Taylor-Joy as Casey Cooke, Spencer Treat Clark as Jospeh Dunn, and Charlayne Woodard as Mrs. Price are all good
to great. I do think Anya Taylor-Joy was a bit weird in some moments, but she was good.The pacing of this movie is bad. The movie feels very disjointed. There's a lot of scenes that focus on the side characters that weren't that important. I mean I get what they were trying to do, but some of these scenes could be cut, and it wouldn't change the movie at all. There's a scene where David's son just looks at a guy lifting weights. I get it, but it messes up the pacing, and is just very unnecessary.The storyline, and most of the movie is a mess. Especially the third act.
The first act is by far the strongest act. It shows us what everyone is up to, and how they each get into the institution. If the movie would've stayed with that quality it would've probably been as good or better than Unbreakable. Unfortunately it only gets worse. I don't think it's ever bad, but it's too convenient at times, too convoluted, and too many things are left unexplained.The second act is where Mr. Glass starts setting up his plan for the finale, but everything he does feels so convenient. There's a scene where it tries to show how he did all of this, and I thought it could've been an amazing scene, but it wasn't shown well, and it barely explained anything that we needed to know. It was still too convenient. We're left to assume that he did it because he's a genius, but it seems more like lazy writing. Also I feel like David Dunn was too side tracked. We didn't get enough of him. Ignoring the really convenient moments the set up is good, and it does get you excited, but...The third act is by far the worst act. It's an absolute mess. It has about 3 twists. The first one was good, but I found it pretty predictable. Then it hits us with another, and It genuinely surprised me, but it not in a good way. It barely made sense sense. It's not really ever explained well, or set up, it just happens, and while it brings up an interesting theme, it's just a bad twist. The third one however I did really like, and I thought was brilliant. The twists aren't the only problems though. There's surprisingly a lot of action, and I kinda hate how it's shot with so many POV shots. I think overall the action was good, but it could've had less of that. The finale just leaves you with so many questions, and a lot of stuff left unexplained. There's some themes introduced with these twists, but they don't have enough time to develop, they're kind of like an after taste. Theres some really interesting topics actually, but when you introduce them right at the end, they never flourished.I do want to mention once again that I did like this film despite a lot of issues I have with it. If I'd have to say other negatives I had with the films I'd probably say not enough of the main characters. I mean Mr. Glass is amazing, but for a movie named Glass he's in it as much as the other guys, and not enough. Same thing goes with David Dunn, who is mostly absent around the second act. Also near the beginning there was this weird salt bae thing?! Idk I just found it unnecessary, and it took me out of the moment. Another issue I had was with the movie feeling a bit too meta at times. I mean it becomes a little too silly for me, it could've worked if they were more subtle about it. I'm not saying it ruins the movie or anything, but some parts were too meta. Finally I'd say there really isn't an arc for a lot of these characters, or at least a fully developed one. We do get some sort of arc for David Dunn, but like I said, he's side tracked, and his arc is resolved too quickly. I guess the side characters had an arc, but they were just getting in the way for me. I wanted to see more of the main 3, and while I do like the side characters, and I think they're good, the movie would've benefitted from more of the main characters. I mean their interactions are awesome.Overall I did really like Glass, but it has a lot of issues. The performances are great for the most part, especially James McAvoy as The Hoard, which is absolutely incredible. The lighting, cinematography, set design, it's all beautiful. There are moments, glimpses where you see M. Night Shyamalan's genius, and it's these amazing moments that give us insight, and show us the potential of this film, but then the rest of the movie just isn't as good, and it really disappoints me because this movie could've just been amazing. This movie is what I like to call a flawed masterpiece.6.9/10",Glass
225,lucasnochez,Film Review: Glass/www.nightfilmreviews.com,4,12 February 2019,"The time is 2019, and as an audience member and lover of film and cinema in a contemporary world, one has to understand and come to terms with the fact that superhero films are here, and seem to be here to stay for an unforeseen future. While many claim to be tired and exasperated with the not so recent trend of the superhero genre, it seems that the numbers don't really reflect the attitudes. While sighs are heard every time a new trailer for a Marvel or DC Universe film is revealed from a majority, the box office for these films just keep getting bigger and bigger with each new character, entry, sequel or prequel.
Yet, while Marvel and DC aren't the only ones pumping out superhero films, and well before the Marvel Cinematic Universe became nomenclature for many, it seems that M. Night Shaymalan was well ahead of the curb when it came to creating his own universe of superheroes and villains, we just were not aware of it at the time.While Split revealed a very exciting fact in the closing credits scene, it seems that the secret is out on Glass, Shaymalan's newest film. Less of an emotional twist ending and more of a narrative one, Split revealed that the film existed in the same universe as Shaymalan's highly applauded and loved origin superhero film Unbreakable.Yet, while many believed that Shaymalan's golden days were behind him as a director, Split seemed to have revived the once untouchable then plagued director back into the spotlight. After the massive success of Split and the idea to connect his two creations into one universe and have them collide in Glass, was a risk the studio was willing to make, especially given the director's modest budgeting range. While Unbreakable was made on an unusually large $75 million dollar budget back in 2000 (which was unheard of then, but thanks to the immense success of The Sixth Sense, studios were hopeful), the film only brought in only $250 million worldwide, which only paled in comparison to the director's hit The Sixth Sense, a film that brought in almost $700 million on a miniature $40 million budget. Yet, after a string of massive critical failures, including Lady In The Water, The Happening, The Last Airbender and After Earth, with only one of those films being a box office slump in Lady In The Water, Shaymalan went from critical darling and wonder-kid, to a running gag within the film industry. Yet, after almost a decade of making terrible films, Shaymalan resilience brought him a return to form, thanks to his comeback film and going back to his horror roots with the low-budget indie film The Visit, thus resurrecting the once ostracized filmmaker.With new life and his origin intentions of creating a trilogy based superhero universe well before Marvel and Kevin Feige was even in the picture, Shaymalan began extending his superhero world with Split, unknown to audiences at the time. With a budget of only $9 million dollars, Shaymalan focused less on spectacle and created a superhero universe grounded in character study and depth; focusing more on 'what' makes a superhero/villain as opposed to the challenges they face once they are fully evolved. For Glass, another modest budget of $20 million shows just how little faith the Hollywood studios have in the once dominating director, especially when that amount of money barely pays for a headlining actor or a marketing budget. Yet, nineteen years later, here we are with Glass, the finale of what's being called the East Rail 177 trilogy.Dissecting Glass for too long, one may very well make the whole film shatter; but as fragile and tempered the film really is, the ambition behind an almost two decade long dream, is quite remarkable, especially during a time where superhero films are pumped out faster than human life is. One of the many satisfying factors of Glass is Shaymalan's ability to round-up characters from the first two films, and each character never skipping a beat in Glass; the performances are easily the best parts of the film.Picking up right where Split left off, David Dunn (Bruce Willis) and his sidekick son and tech savvy partner, providing Dunn with his eyes and ears, Joseph Dunn (Spencer Treat Clark, the original son in Unbreakable which was great to see) use the internet, social media and surveillance technology as tools towards capturing the troubled Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy). After successfully tracking down Crumb before he takes the lives of another innocent group of teenage girls, Dunn and Crumb engage in a very muted and underwhelming face-off, until they are both captured by the authorities, accompanied by ""comic-book therapist"" Dr. Ellie Staple (Sarah Paulson). Brought to a psychiatric ward where Dr.Staple is keen on giving realization that both men are in fact not superhuman, they both soon realize that Elijah Price aka Mister Glass (Samuel L. Jackson) is in the same hospital following his terrifying acts in Unbreakable. As the plot plays out, Elijah's still obsessive motive to prove to the world that super good guys and sinister bad guys exist, Mister Glass schemes up an elaborate plan to get Dunn and Crumb fight it out, for all the world to see.While Glass is no where as superior to Unbreakable or Split, kudos needs to be given to Shyamalan for transforming a genre of popular film by focusing less on the action set pieces and more on the characters with these amazing and unique abilities. Now, whether or not this is because of his lack of budget, because we all know what he did with the $150 million budget of The Last Airbender, perhaps this is Shaymalan's niche after all? Shaymalan delivers what we like to call, grass-roots super hero films, and he does it with elegance and grace, except when he is trying to tying them all together as he does with Glass.While Glass is the third (and perhaps final) entry of the East Rail 177 trilogy, the film feels more like a condensed sequel. Although Shyamalan ties in references to Unbreakable in Glass, there is no question that the filmmaker has a hefty job of juggling so many important characters into a very respectable comic book runtime. Yet, the more and more we get with McAvoy and his highly tormented character, the more and more we are engaged with Glass. It comes without question that all three male leads are exceptional in the film, but McAvoy shines as always, juggling multiple personalities, in an instant, almost effortlessly. Since it is no surprise now, given Shaymalan's extensive filmography, that the director is highly influences by the likes of Hitchcock, Shyamalan has an affinity for the renown filmmaker just in McAvoy's character alone, sending reminders of a very familiar Norman Bates in Psycho, specifically Kevin's personality known as Patricia, proving a clear homage to one of his great idols.Yet although Shaymalan is directly influenced by some of the most respected, it comes to no surprise that his writing always seems to be some of the critics toughest pill to swallow. Oozing with constant comic book references as well as heavy-handed pop culture references, the film's tone suffers from dark, nightmarish comic book noir feels to goofy limited actioner film mess; especially given the large and hugely promising idea of the final square off between Dunn and Crumb, which hardly and almost never comes. Instead, Shyamalan employs the use of interminable drawn out Average Shot Lengths (ALS) with his ALS striking comparison with films circa 1940 to the 1960's. Now, whether or not this stylistic choice again alludes to the directors need to praise his admirers, or due to a lack of budget, but the film's action set pieces seem all too restrained and something left to be desired of audience members.Glass stills has great moments and aspects that really become effervescent within the comic book genre. From West Dylan Thordson magnifying score, blending heavy violin stabs and eerie buildups scream similar to the work of the late great Bernard Herrmann, to some truly fantastic ideas of the film starting off as a comic book film set in a real world where medicine, science and fiction collide, Shaymalan offers a lot of meaty and thoughtful material with Glass.Glass then becomes a culmination of a Roman drama; crisis and sovereign Shyamalan plot twists make the finale something unique and different, for comic book films today. Essentially, Shyamalan does exactly what we want him to do; provide us with characters we know and love, build up tension, drama and action, and knock our socks off with some mind-bending and twisted surprise ending.Glass, as a thriller hits all of the right notes. As the director basks in his passionate territory of cinema- Glass makes one thing clear, and that's M. Night's love for comic books. Glass allows the director to geek out on his truly cerebral first love.Glass is fresh, supernatural, dark yet at times comedic look into the world of heroes and villains, the ideas of mental illness and the expectations of society, our expectations as an audience and a genre of cinema that will live on far longer than us, in the cinematic history books for generations to come.",Glass
226,PotassiumMan,Shamefully underrated trilogy conclusion,7,17 February 2019,"I cannot comprehend why critics have chosen to denigrate this film, which turns out to be M. Night Shyamalan's best in many, many years. Perhaps the film's conclusion is not what some expected but that's still no excuse to not acknowledge its achievement in piecing together (quite intelligently, I might add) all that exists in this trilogy, in this complex web of madness, super human ability and unfathomable power plays and ethical questions of superheroes and society.Having seen ""Unbreakable"" in its day, I will confess this was not what I expected either. But whether I agree with the route a film takes is not the point, so long as it is congruent with the character development that takes place. Jon McAvoy, Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson are at the top of their game in this film as the three extraordinary pieces to the puzzle that Shyamalan has plotted for us. Equally sharp is Sarah Paulson as a psychiatric specialist whose role becomes more defined as the film goes along. Spencer Treat Clark makes a welcome return as Willis's son, who has always been aware of his father's abilities.Contrary to the reviews, this film was never slow and never lost its way. You will scarcely notice the running time. In fact, its transition into the final act was seamless. I advise moviegoers not to be swayed by what the critics have said about this film. To put it bluntly, they are wrong. At the very least, it's thought-provoking. To those looking for a gripping, vintage Shyamalan film, I enthusiastically recommend this one.",Glass

It just adds that much authenticity to the story.The twsts hit hard and fast during the third act, and knowing Shyamalan you'll try to work things out as the movie progresses - only to find out you got duped by the Twist Master.

He's made an incredible movie (""The Sixth Sense,"") some pretty good ones (""Unbreakable,"" ""Split,"" ""The Visit"") and some terrible ones (e.g. ""The Last Airbender."") While I understand the arguments that those who disliked the film are using to justify their sense of disappointment with this film, and I am not oblivious to the film's flaws, I thought that this ambitious trilogy-finale was enthralling and generally satisfying.First and foremost, the film is heightened considerably by its performances. The three leads (Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis and James McAvoy) are all excellent. In particular, McAvoy's depiction of Kevin Wendell Crumb's 20-plus personalities clearly shows intense dedication to the craft of acting, as properly managing such erratic changes between traits of a character while playing a role is an incredibly difficult feat. His performance in this film feels every bit as strong as how he played the role in ""Split."" Regarding the supporting cast, Sarah Paulson and Anya Taylor-Joy are both excellent. The former plays the main psychiatrist in the psychiatric hospital in which most of the film takes place, and the latter reprises her role from ""Split"" as Casey. Spencer Treat Clarke also provides balance to the narrative by playing David Dunn's son.While I will not give any plot details away, I found the third act gripping and one of the most powerful parts of this trilogy. This confirms why I generally enjoyed ""Glass,"" mainly because we feel far more invested and interested in the characters and their motivations than in either ""Unbreakable"" or ""Split."" Don't get me wrong, I liked both of those two films, and they both are better than ""Glass."" However, this level of impact depicted in major characterizations helps audiences savor this sequel.""Glass"" isn't perfect, however. The film's pacing is admittedly a little strange, and certainly takes getting used to. The first act is generally entertaining, even though Shyamalan seems to swing for the fences quite a bit during its length--in particular, the juxtaposition of key yet very different scenes leading to plot devices in the narrative can be a jarring way to start off watching the movie. Yet the film drags a fair bit in the second act, and can occasionally feel a bit slow or dull in the middle. Furthermore, the film's reliance on the most basic comic book tropes to intersect the plot lines can occasionally feel a bit blasé given the intense saturation of superhero films in mainstream American cinema today. ""Unbreakable"" was released in 2000, which was well before the superhero movie genre had truly taken off like we know it today. (For example, 2000 was 8 years before the MCU started and ""The Dark Knight"" came out.) Despite these flaws and respective inconsistencies, I did like how Shyamalan was able to develop the three leads further as characters, and felt that such ""payoffs"" really affect the viewer by the time it gets to its third act. Some mainstream audiences may be disappointed by the relatively small amount of action scenes compared to the ways that the film's marketing seems to be selling the material. Overall, I would recommend this to fans of Shyamalan, although it will be polarizing among general moviegoers. 7.5/10Note 1: I saw the film in Dolby Cinema. Unfortunately, this is the first film I have seen in Dolby that did not take as much advantage of the enhanced visual and sound qualities as I would have hoped.Note 2: It would be very difficult to understand the plot without having seen both ""Unbreakable"" and ""Split,"" so I strongly recommend people to watch them (or watch them again to 'brush up') before heading to the theaters. This isn't a sequel where you can just know the most basic details about the previous movies and will be fine.",Glass
231,MoistMovies,"Pretty predictable 'twists', slow and cop out ending",5,23 January 2019,"It's by all means not a bad film. But its not very good either. I Rated its two predecessors much higher.
And its attempt to wrap up this trilogy was very lazy in my opinion, what some people see as risky or whatever, i felt a bit cheated out of a better story to tell.
A lot of missing potential with this film, thats how i'd categorize it. Acting was fine, even Willis seemed to put a little effort in which is rare anymore.
But the screen play should've been something entirely different in most ways, with quite a few dumb plot holes that should've been easily reworked. It was clearly rushed out and M.night did not have this film well planned like split was.
And the twist with pullsons character... Ughh if you didnt suspect ulterior motives earlier in the film, then your 'powers' of deduction must be lacking.
Glass's twist was the only one that wasnt clear as day, but still not unpredictable either.And what they did with the main characters really griped me the most. So lazy and unoriginal... Risky ive heard it being called.. yeah risky of making you feel like they didnt know how to end it with something creative.

235,cdjh-81125,Shatters Like....,6,9 May 2019,"Despite the fact that Ive never loved Unbreakable, I was blown away by the twist ending of Split and was so excited to see how M. Night Shyamalan would wrap up his 3 movie arc. Despite having some great ideas and performances I was disappointed by Glass, that being said I do think the film is better than critics gave it credit for.James McAvoy gave the best performance of his career in Split but he may have been even better here. He gets even more characters to play but he does them all perfectly and there's not a moment he's on screen that I don't believe he's playing completely different personality's. Samuel L Jackson was also excellent in this movie, it's like he never left the role and while he doesn't come into play until about half way through the films he still did the best with what he was given. Bruce Willis was honestly just fine in the movie, he's almost entirely written out of the 3rd act and when he is on screen Shyamalan doesn't write a lot of interesting material for him.
I like how M Night continued the realistic depiction of superhero's that he had in Unbreakable. It truly is a realistic depiction of them and makes me view this film in a different way than I would a film more out there and larger than life. The conversations the characters have about their powers and abilities and the best written parts of the film and I wished Shyamalan had incorporated more of that into the film.The first act of the film is easily the best. It builds the conflict between David Dunn and The Beast really well. The eventual fight between them was really satisfying and it really feels like the whole movie should've been like that First Act. The second act was fine, it felt like Shyamalan was trying to play to his strengths by slowing down the pace and keeping the characters in a confined location. While locking up the characters created for good drama it didn't feel earned to have the whole act set in one location.The last act of the film is what really lets the film down. Like all other Shyamalan films it has a twist and here it just doesn't work. It doesn't feel remotely well built up so it just comes out of nowhere and brings the film to an unsatisfying conclusion. It also ends the character arcs in a very unsatisfying way and its really sad to see Shyamalan take 2 decades to plan out this trilogy and it ends on such an underwhelming note.Glass is by no means a bad film, it's got interesting ideas and great performances but by the 3rd act the film just collapses in on itself. It didn't really feel like Shyamalan needed a big twist to end this film and it shows in its sloppy execution. Like Unbreakable this film could develop a cult following but it doesn't take away from the disappointment the film has for me now.6.5/10 (Middling]",Glass

Have people believe in themselves? Yeah, we surely needed 3 films for that.
Not much character development, by the way.
I didn't like the plot of Glass. The psychiatric ward, with having the audience guessing ""was it all in their head despite seeing them do superhuman stuff?"". I didn't buy it at all. Though, I like the fact that they tried to do something different, rather than a classic superhero movie. But I would've liked something inbetween.

I did see the original two flicks and I figured there would be a reckoning between the people involved but had no idea what direction the movie was going to go.This is not a superhero film. This is the mistake many people make about the movies. Though there are people with powers, it is really about the consequence of having powers rather than the in your face action sequences you get from the forgettable popcorn flicks. This was also the case for the 1st two movies so i am not sure why people went into this thinking it would be different. This movie simply connects the story together and in some ways, covers the plot holes in the other movies.I have to admit that up to the end, I really did not enjoy the psychology angle very much because it was not believable so unlike many, I actually liked the ending. I do not agree that this movie is overly dark. As they say, the pen is mightier than the sword and though this is not always true, in the case of this movie and the setting, it was. Then again it may just be the sap in me that likes to see good win...Overall I think this was a good film. I still like Unbreakable more but I would say that this was slightly better than Split only because that one dragged on a bit too long. But dont go in expecting Avengers, JLA, or XMen.

It's great to see a flawed female character and she had no hesitation in embracing those flaws in a layered, multi-dimensional package. I also enjoyed the performance of James McAvoy who played many personalities and also had to transform between them on the fly. In some ways, McAvoy's performance was technically superb.Where the movie let me down is that I struggled to feel invested in the characters. In some ways, I really didn't care if they lived or they died. There was a detachment that I just couldn't move beyond. I watched the characters reveals, I saw their pain, I saw their conflicts. However, I felt a remoteness from the characters that left me feeling indifferent.I respect this film took risks and told an interesting story. I respect the acting was solid.

248,joshbarton15,Fitting end to an eccentric superhero trilogy.,7,18 January 2019,"M Knight Shyamalan is not one to shy away from involving a twist or two in his films. Back in 2016, he shocked the whole world with the ending to Split, a film that seemed to standalone from all his other films. That was until Bruce Willis' David Dunn, a character from his 2000 film Unbreakable made an appearance. It shocked me massively and left me with great levels of anticipation for Glass, a sequel to both films.Reuniting David Dunn (Bruce Willis) and Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), and introducing them to Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy) sees events unfold in Glass. With Dunn in pursuit of Crumb and his multiple personalities, Price a.k.a. Mr Glass may hold secrets of both their respective pasts.Shyamalan's Glass sees two big ideas spread across two films culminate in a finale fitting to the director's past of twisting and turning right until the very last frame. His writing is electric for the first half of the film, exploring the current state-of-mind of each of the three who believe themselves to be superheroes. It's as the film moves into its final act where things start to nearly turn catastrophically convoluted but Shyamalan manages to weave his way through a quite complex narrative rather well, resulting in a satisfying conclusion to his trilogy.I always wondered how Shyamalan would make Glass work as a sequel to both Unbreakable and Split however, right from the off it just works, giving the film the perfect platform to push on and explore these characters further.Coming to the performances, Glass has a returning trio who all deliver solid performances in roles that remain some of their best work. James McAvoy is, once again, scarily good as not just Kevin but the multiple personalities he possesses, possibly bettering his own performance in Split. Samuel L Jackson has a film of two halves for an actor and when he gets into gear, his villain is as menacing as he's been before. Bruce Willis was the one who I was worried about, mainly because of his recent performances in films like Death Wish, where the lack of emotion derailed the film. With the flick of a switch though, Willis wakes up and proves in Glass that he can deliver a performance when needed.Sarah Paulson's Dr Ellie Staple is a very welcome addition to the roster and it's great to see Anya Taylor-Joy return as Casey Cooke, even if both eventually get lost amongst the heavy final act.While Glass is a weaker film than both Unbreakable and Split, it still manages to provide this eccentric superhero trilogy with an ending that isn't afraid to wear its heart on its sleeve. It may lose some but, for me, it shows Shyamalan is still not afraid to make a film the way he wants and, in today's Hollywood, that's something that should be applauded.",Glass
249,jaredpahl,Shyamalan's Comic Book Trilogy Ends with a Fizzle. Glass is a Dumb Mess.,4,27 March 2020,"M. Night Shyamalan is a corny writer who can either harness his banalities in haunting, emotionally gripping ways, or let them run wild. Glass, the third of his interconnected ""comic book"" movies, is much closer to his goofy Lady in the Water than it is to his masterpieces The Sixth Sense and Signs.With Split in 2016, M. Night Shyamalan created his own cinematic superhero universe, connecting the events of the multiple-personality thriller to his previous superheroes-in-the-real-world movie, Unbreakable. Glass brings these two characters (Bruce Willis' proto-superman David Dunn, and James McAvoy's Kevin Michael Crumb) together, along with Unbreakable's Elijah Price AKA Mr. Glass (Samuel L. Jackson). So after a routine superhero fight goes wrong, The Overseer (Willis) and The Horde/The Beast (McAvoy) join Mr. Glass in a high security facility where Sarah Paulson's Dr. Ellie Staple tries to rid them of the delusion that they are, in fact, super-powered. To say one positive about the plot of Glass, it does not roll out predictably from the first reel. There are, of course, twists along the way; some of them kind of clever. That said, the big fat problem with Glass is the writing. You see, it is stuffed with hackneyed garbage. The dialogue especially is a chorus of comic book hokum about heroes, villains, delusions of grandeur, and master plans. It comes from just about every character, but worst of all is The Horde, played terribly by James McAvoy.Watching McAvoy on the screen is clearly the most painful part of the Glass experience. Granted, he wasn't good in Split either. The whole multiple personalities gimmick is intrusively unimpressive to begin with, but in Glass it's plain obnoxious. Look, when he's not jutting his neck veins out and dry heaving, McAvoy is basically playing Guess Who characters. 23 flat, one-dimensional cartoon archetypes. And Shyamalan seems to think that we're interested in seeing ALL of them in any given scene. So we get these protracted sequences of McAvoy shuffling through dozens of different badly done accents and costume changes. McAvoy, bless his heart, is working very hard. He lays down just about every overworked Actor's trick in the book to come across as menacing (wavering voice, physical transformations, expressive eyes) but not a one of them works. I would look forward to any time away from his character as a sweet respite from the pain of watching him flounder on the screen.What's frustrating is that the movie is well directed by Shyamalan. There is a great deal more visual storytelling in Glass than in any movie that's ever come out of the Marvel factory. But it's all going into this extremely silly junk. The script is stupid. My eyes started rolling and did not stop. Each dopey line about the empathetic voice inside yourself or the real world power of comic books had me waving my hand at the screen in annoyance. Every dumb cliche had me letting out a sigh. I like M. Night Shyamalan's corny sincerity. It's what makes him a special voice. But when that corniness goes unchecked, it can really hurt his movies. In Glass, it's out in the open, running through the grass on all fours.41/100",Glass

253,haydenluz,Glass,5,4 July 2020,"M. Night Shyamalan returned once again to make the final addition to his Eastrail177 trilogy, which ultimately felt underwhelming. With his first two films being creative and unique, he carried on that tradition to this film, but halfway through, it seemed like he hit a wall and didn't know where to go. The pacing of the movie was a little choppy, being high octane at first, then slowing down considerably in the second act, and then picking up again in the third act. M. Night always gives us something to look forward to come the final act, but things were a little predictable, and just didn't live up to the hype that was theirs for the taking.Shyamalan was able to bring our three characters together, but had a tough time balancing everyone out, which really didn't seem like a hard thing to accomplish. With the production design being claustrophobic, he was given a great opportunity to have his characters clash, but he seemed to try to channel it, and it personally got boring halfway through. James McAvoy, once again, was the star of the film, and somewhat carried it. Shyamalan fleshed out his character even more, being most of the main focus throughout the film. The one character you'd think would be in the film the most, was basically only in it for the last third of the film. While Sam Jackson put on a good performance, his character really didn't do much, other than doing the stereotypical things a brainiac-cripple would do. Bruce Willis was surprisingly sidelined as well. His cameo in Split gave us the notion that he was going to finally take on his responsibilities, but we got little characterization, and a disappointing ending. For such a prominent character, I needed much more from him.The screenplay was probably the weakest out of the trilogy. There was a lot of one on one dialogue that got pretty stale, with a lot of description of the characters, but it didn't characterize them all that much.Overall, just a sad miss to cap off the Eastrail177 series.",Glass
254,domtaylor,"Two-thirds pointless, one-third stupid.",5,28 January 2019,"'Glass' is a definite step-down from the fantastic 'Unbreakable' and the good 'Split', and therefore a real disappointment. Although he was good in 'Split', McAvoy is simply hammy here, and the novelty of the performance has well worn-off by the start of this film. Perhaps though, that's more of a problem with the script. Willis is just plain bored, and Jackson is... well, Jackson. The set-up is okay, but it's not long before we are in the mental institution and the crux of the film takes place. Unfortunately, the key enigma of the whole second act (and therefore the majority of the runtime) has already been answered for us in the previous two films, and been made clear in the first act of this one. Therefore, there's no intrigue or reason for us to be invested in anything that's happening. It doesn't help that not much actually occurs at all, and the pacing really drags during this middle section. As we get into the third act, things actually become rather enjoyable - probably because things of note are occurring again; Willis doesn't have much to say here and McAvoy and Jackson are, at least, trying. Unfortunately, this section is just a shadow of what could have been because as we reach the finale things get rather stupid and underwhelming. The so-called ""big twist"" has no impact on the plot whatsoever and when it all wraps up it doesn't elicit anything but a shrug. It's far from Shyamalan's worst work, but where Dunn, Price, and even Crumb ended up after their films finished would have probably been better left to our imaginations. They are a lot better than M. Night's, that's for sure. 5/10",Glass

M N Shyamalan has made some crackers in Signs and Devil and some shockers in The Village and The Happening.
Unbreakable and Split were good but tie them all together with Glass and I believe it's a work of art.
Without spoiling I'll keep the premise simple are the such things as super hero's and super villains. Bruce Willis being the maybe hero, Samuel L Jackson being the maybe super villain and the superb James McAvoy being the maybe monster. Or is it all mental illness???

256,rcolgan,What a Twist!,4,7 February 2019,"To give a quick overview of how I feel about Shaymylan's work, I believe he has made only two good films. One of those films is Unbreakable, a great take on comic book mythos telling an interesting story about an ordinary man trying to come to terms with the fact that he may have extraordinary abilities.Unfortunately Shyamalan's films after that ranged between being OK to being so bad that they end up feeling like an SNL parody sketch of what a bad film would look like. But then 16 years later, Shyamalan came out with Split which revealed in the end credits that it was a secret sequel to Unbreakable and that his next film would be a crossover where the unbreakable man meets the unstoppable force.And it certainly starts off like that, with David (once again played by Bruce Willis) hunting down Kevin (James McAvoy) to end a killing spree he has been on since the end of split. However after a brief confrontation, a psychiatrist played by Sarah Paulson arrives with armed guards and puts them in a psychiatric facility where Jackson's Elijah has been since the end of Unbreakable and she tells them that they are all suffering from psychological delusions that they are super powered beings.Unfortunately after this a lot of the rest of the film rarely has the main trio of actors being in the same room as each other. This is likely due to budgetary constraints or scheduling issues as even in scene's where they are supposed to be in the same room, it's shot in a way that makes it clear that they came in to film in separate days.The lack of time together causes two big problems for the film. Firstly the leads don't get enough screen time to build up a good arc in the film, with Willis absent through most of the build up to the climax and Jackson not becoming involved until over half way in to the film. And I know that Jackson has a busy schedule appearing in every film ever made, but you'd really think the title character would get a bit more screen time.Second, part of the reason why people were interested in the crossover is to see these characters interact. What David's relationship with Elijah would be like knowing he was responsible for killing every person on the train. Or how he interacts with McAvoy's 20 plus personalities. But we don't get that because there is not enough time for the actors to bounce off one another and develop their personalities or relationships.Instead of spending time having these characters interact, most of the film is spent with Sarah Paulson's character trying to convince the trio that they aren't super powered. But we've already spent the past two films exploring whether they are really super-powered beings and have already had their powers confirmed. We've seen McAvoy literally physically transform in to the beast and Willis perform impossible feats of strength, so spending so much time getting the characters to question this feels wasted when it could have been spent exploring new ideas.Having said all that there are some films that work well in the film. Once again McAvoy pulls off a great performance as the 20+ personalities that make up Kevin. Seeing him switch between these personalities mid shot is really impressive and shows off how well he can develop each of the characters personalities and traits. Plus for the low budget that the film had the few actions sequences that they have are shot in an interesting way. Shaymalan uses quite a few perspective shots and close ups which give the sequences quite a claustrophobic feel.It also does have several trademark Shyamalan twists. These will probably be the thing that divide the audience the most in this film. Personally I think one of the twists works at deconstructing the comic book mythos, whilst the other twists just don't make practical sense and should have had the characters figure out the twists far earlier in to the film.Unfortunately this is a weak end to Shamylan's trilogy of superhero films. There's so much wasted potential from this film with Shaymalan rarely giving his characters the time to develop or bounce of one another. Or better yet, after spending the past two films with the characters coming to grips with their own extraordinary powers, wouldn't it have been interesting to see more of how the world reacts to these powers? The film actually hints that it might explore this idea at a few points in the film, but it never really goes anywhere with them.",Glass
257,gerry_barnaby,Complicated twist ending that need you to listen to the dialgue to get.,9,18 January 2019,"I'm kind of confused to whether I like this film or not, its good but I kind of found it hard to take seriously because of funny at moment with Kevin, if you every watched split you understand why. Which is why I think James McAvoy is a great actor to keep all those personalities flowing in one shot from scene to scene without break the immersion of his character, which is really hard for an actor/actress to do.This most definitely not your average or typical hero movie, it more of a psychological thriller with people that can do extraordinary thing with a dark twist style story, that seems familiar with M. Night Shyamalan films.
Although I feel this is great there were a few areas where the film could've been improved more, especial with Bruce Willis character who started this trilogy with unbroken as I feel his character was underutilized, could've had a bit more scenes of him save people, though the film felt more of a villian film in a way.Samuel L Jackson brilliant deception throughout the film, as well as delivering great dialogue which is the keys to what's going on, so it worth listening very carefully to what he saying in order for you to understand this film.Visual this film is great using the lights to change or switch James character personality which is clever use of getting the right personality out and control them, its most differently a film you should take notices of what's being said, as it the key to what is actually going on rather than just visual showing the audience what's going on, which may be a little complicated for some people.Even more, the complicated ending which most people might not get, but it was a very complicated and clever twist in an origin story that completely throws the other two film off guard, which may leave people confused but I assure you there is meaning to the ending.If you like unbreakable and split you gonna love this film, it will depend on whether you get the ending or not because after watching it my self even I could tell it could confuse people, but it has a real meaning to a continuing universe.Dislikes: Pacing is a bit slow at time and the ending can be confusing to some audiances which might be its downfall.",Glass
258,mochteam,Started Off Great but Ended Poorly,5,23 August 2019,"I wasn't exactly blown away by ""Unbreakable"" I thought it was rather dull at the time but Split was really something quite new and interesting that I enjoyed a lot. Well what happens when you put a dull movie together with a good movie? You get this movie. Bruce Willis with the dull character he played in Unbreakable plus Samuel L. Jackson and the weird/boring character he played in unbreakable and then toss in James McAvoy and the thrilling character he played in Split and you have a 5/10 movie.How could it go wrong or where did it go wrong? Well the movie took too long to connect to ""Unbreakable"". Unbreakable itself wasn't that great it just seemed awkward. It didn't make any sense that Samuel L Jacksons character would try to find a super hero by trying to commit acts of mass murder and terrorism. Then he finds by chance Bruce Willis who has the power to do what exactly? Be ""Kinda"" strong? Fast forward 17 - 18 years and we have SPLIT a movie where a person has multiple identities and one happens to give them almost supernatural abilities. The twist in that movie was that ""The Beast"" was something that we never new was real or not until the end. In this movie ""The Beast"" has no buildup or suspense so the ""terror"" of that character is gone which was the magic of that movie the suspense.Glass starts off on the wrong foot. I think by not giving you much input on what Bruce has been up to since 1999. He's just thrown into his role chasing down ""The horde"". While the ""Horde"" is doing whatever it did in the last movie. Then they go off as you guess it fighting each other the super hero and villian theme like from Unbreakable.I have no idea why M.Night throws in this comic book logic into this movie. Like he did in unbreakable. It just makes the movie weird and even more unrealistic as he's trying to create a realistic movie in a realistic world yet the characters use the comic book store for a research reference. I'll just leave it at that this movie is filled with ideas that should have been left out and an ending that makes you wonder why this movie was even created.Tying Split in with Unbreakable was a mistake. Unbreakable 2 should have been it's own movie void of any relation to SPLIT and SPLIT 2 should have been it's own movie void of any relation to Unbreakable. The tie in is weak and the ending is weak and the plot is pointless. I just can't understand why M.Night can't make a decent quality ending to movie without always going for a twist that is both UNNECESSARY and UNNEEDED. If he could figure out just to give people a decent ending that the audience wants to see he would actually be a good director. Not every movie needs to be ""The sixth sense"". We don't need an ""I see dead people"" moment in every film. Just go for a good enjoyable ending even if it's obvious!This movie should have never happened. It left me feeling just as annoyed,bored and depressed as watching Unbreakable did back in 99'. Just a really weird and unsatisfying movie.This guy seriously needs to get someone elses input on his movie ideas to tell him these things before he starts filming. So many good ""ideas"" ruined by his unnecessary plot twist drama and GLASS was no exception.& Why didn't ""The horde"" just close his eyes to avoid the lights?",Glass

It is a decent enough sequel to its 2 great predecessor movies - ""Unbreakable"" and ""Split"". The movie ""Glass"" features the combination of 3 top-notch and talented actors (Bruce Willis, James McAvoy, Samuel l.

Willis and Jackson remind us the reasons that they are classified as iconic actors of their generation. James McAvoy proves once again that he is a genuinely outstanding actor, not just a handsome face. In the movie, the interactions between the 3 actors have been skillfully handled and presented by the director, M. Night Shyamalan.Mr Shyamalan is a very good director, however, he could have written and created a better ending for this eagerly awaited film titled ""Glass"".

Night crafts his tragic yet powerful magnum opus with this future classic; GLASS.",10,20 January 2019,"9.5/10 As the ultimate culmination of Unbreakable and Split, this film has already been insanely misunderstood and unfairly rated/reviewed by "" critics "" and some average moviegoers alike. They seemed to have expected a fast paced superhero film without deep character study, and dedicated storytelling with heart which is what this film has in bunches. If anything this is the most realistic and grounded film about super humans/heroes/villains that we've ever seen with dramatic outcomes that don't fit the usual cliche formula of so many superhero related films. Another reason Shyamalan deserves tons of respect for swinging away ambitiously with his stories and overall vision knowing many won't understand it.The film starts out with a marvelous opening sequence that throws us back into familiar territory with these intriguing characters and what they are up to presently, and sets the tone nicely with excitement. As things progress the film does slow down drastically to spend time on characterization and the story's overall emotional depth. When everything comes together for the conclusion, the pace picks up intensely to an absolutely mind blowing string of events that will leave people talking for ages to come. Shyamalan is known for clever twists and extremely crazy endings and this one might be his most effectively executed one yet and that says something.On the acting spectrum, this showcases once again just how mind boggling and versatile James McAvoy's Kevin/Horde character is. His enthusiasm, dedication, and wide range execution is up there with some of the greatest and most legendary acting I've ever seen, and he was snubbed of an Oscar and most likely will be again. He deserves massive amounts of credit once again. Sam Jackson's Elijah Price/Mr. Glass portrayal is fantastic as well and just as witty and eccentric as ever, though i wish we would've had more dialogue from him. Speaking of dialogue, one of my only gripes is just how underutilized Bruce Willis's David Dunn character was in the film. I felt like they could've really designated some more time to his character, and especially given him some more lines. He was still solid and his normal self, but wasn't around enough imo.Presentation wise, this was classic M. Night with crisp camera work, colorful schemes, and creative angling. He clearly has a keen eye for setting up certain scenes and shots in a unique and brilliant manner and keeps the film visually intriguing throughout. The effects in the action sequences are relatively solid especially when you think of the practical and frugal budget, which makes it all the more impressive. The soundtrack perfectly blends the familiar sonic themes from the first 2 films and compliments the overall experience fantastically.Overall I would say to go into this like its more of a psychological drama than a thriller, and to really stop and think just how grounded its identity really is with all of its emotional power and symbolic messages. I believe once people can do that eventually they will learn to love this film the way its intended to be.",Glass

It depends on great acting, builds up the story slowly, and ends with a plottwist. What is great about the movie is its interesting take on superheroes, and how it makes them more grounded to reality. James McAvoy shines as usual as he effortlessly slips from one personality to another. You just can't help be amazed by his talent. When Samuel L Jackson is in action, the story gets more interesting. Bruce Willis' character was the most tragic and his character could have been used more, unfortunately, like all other reviews say, he was sidelined. Shymalan always manages to maintain suspense from the beginning till the end, and this is what makes the movie brilliant. There were a few action scenes, and they were actually great. I could say this is the most action-packed MNS movie to date (his Last Airbender does not count). A welcome entry to the movie was Sarah Paulson, who plays a psychiatrist trying to prove all our main characters are mentally unstable. I won't talk about the plot twist, but I can say the movie leaves you wanting to know more. But it was a thoroughly enjoyable experience",Glass
266,Wililjam,The ending brought the rating down...,7,2 June 2019,"I liked the movie more than I thought I would. It had great performances and the story was fairly solid. The only bad thing about this movie was the ending, it literally came out of nowhere.Now, I was pretty skeptical about the whole ""it's just a delusion""-thing, and they really sold it to me for a while. Then they revealed that it isn't a delusion, that it's actually real. But then, out of nowhere, it is revealed that a secret organization wants these three super-humans dead and that the doctor was in on it.There were no hints during the movie that that would be the case, so the movie fails at subverting expectations. Here's how they could've hinted the reveal without revealing anything of substance: The doctor and David Dunn are talking in Dunn's room, the doctor knows Dunn can see visions if he touches someone, she tests him. The doctor hold out her hand and David touches her hand, he sees visions of the restaurant where the secret organization seem to meet. Etc. Etc. Etc.Rather than it feeling like a huge reveal, you're feeling like it didn't make sense at all. Don't get me wrong, I don't like hints that tell you where the story is obviously going.

Let's ignore the easter eggs and inside cuteness that M.Night fans love to knead between their fingers. GLASS is a moderately engaging telling followup to UNBREAKABLE. The telling is not tense; it's not compelling nor particularly suspenseful. It has a message at the end about modern society and personal empowerment that the original Star Trek TNG told us 40 years ago. And it doesn't tell us with a fragment of surprise, or shock, nor twist, nor irony. After I got it, I'm like, ""that's it? Thank god I didn't pay theater bux for that.""The acting? Willis is almost a walk-on, just muttering his way through his few dialogue scenes. Samuel L. stares catatonically for half the film, then dives into Jackson-chatter the last half. And McAvoy? Reviewers grossly over-praise him as if they were high school drama club students. He's good, but it all comes off as so ""act-ey,"" like it's an actor's school exercise meant to impress the audience, not serve the story. There's a difference, and sometimes highly skilled actors like McAvoy are allowed by underskilled directors like M. Night, to let the actors riff. And riff. And riff. Let's not replay the Robert Downey Jr. of the 1990s, please. Paulson's portrayal is cookie-cutter as another psychiatrist with a secret. Nothing of substance. Nothing creepy. Nothing off-balance. Nothing compelling. That's not her fault. That's the writer's fault -- M. Night. And it's the director's fault -- M. Night. Are you spotting a pattern here?Don't be surprised that this movie's pacing and visual storytelling are underwhelming; M. Night's recent films have been low budget. Considering that, one might suppose that they wouldn't be so long. But they are. And let's be honest: they're dull.

270,cappiethadog,A film about us,8,30 January 2019,"Something gnaws away at the hindmost recesses of David Dunn's mind. The security guard tries to remember what he wanted to forget. What he had forgotten was too much to deal with. But now, what he had forgotten is all coming back to him. David denies, until he can't deny anymore. Magic. It exists. Suddenly, the ""s"" in ""security"" on his regulation uniform stands out. It was hidden in plain sight all along. The remaining letters concealed his secret identity. But now, they fall by the wayside. The ""s"" remains, in isolation. Elijah(Samuel L. Jackson) was right. The comic book aficionado shatters David's fidelity towards an objective reality that had protected him, as it protects us all, from magical thinking. The evidence, however, puzzling as it may be, laid out before David(Bruce Willis) piles up, so crystal clear as to be incontrovertible, the proof: Life imitates art; life is like a comic book. M. Night Shyamalan's ""Unbreakable"", unbeknownst to the audience, maybe even unbeknownst to him, was an origin story, the first film in a trilogy whose running theme is the schism between truth and lies. At the time, the filmmaker could not have known that the Internet, still a benign expeditor of information, would in the not-so-distant future become a Pandora's Box gone digital, a superhighway to hell. In ""Unbreakable"", the box was closed. David does not go online to seek out others who are gifted. When Elijah tries to convince David of his advantaged place in the world, he can only turn to comic books for substantiation. Fact and fiction, at the outset off the millennium, was still discernible. In ""Glass"", the box is open, and has been for some time.Scientists ""had long since abandoned the concept of repressed memories,"" Kurt Anderson writes, but the general public doesn't know this, due in no small part to the cinema, and its use of the flashback ""that makes the fictional idea of repressed memories seem real,"" citing a Harvard Medical School psychiatry professor in ""Fantasyland: How America Went Haywire, A 500-Year History"". In ""Unbreakable"", repressed memories and objective reality are interrelated. As the lone survivor of a catastrophic train derailment, David had emerged from the wreckage unharmed, without a scratch, leaving the attending ER doctor bereft of consoling words, only quizzical ones. ""Unbreakable"" is notable for its lack of; it's secularity; it's lack of God. In the background, as David leaves a group funeral for the train crash victims, the church looms, and in a different film, the concept of divine intervention would be broached. But instead, the camera pans to the right. The church is just an incidental backdrop. On the windshield of David's vehicle, an envelope, tucked under the wipers read ""Special Edition"" in embossed lettering. It's the name of Elijah's art gallery. The question: ""Have you ever been injured?"" is inscribed in the card. The makings of a miracle is what Elijah's inquiry suggests. It is, but the miracle can't be traced back to bible stories or scripture, but rather, the words and pictures from a comic book. David comes to learn that he has inordinate strength and an ability to see the future through human touch. David's real superpower, however, is performing extraordinary feats of forgetfulness. The security guard can't remember the last time he was sick. Anderson, who writes about Americans and their rejection of the material world, would surmise that David, an ex-high school football star, suffers 'til today from an undiagnosed concussion that never properly healed. But no, it's a repressed memory. The war on science started a long time ago, well before the Internet reinforced the validity of a million untruths. When David goes through a box of old newspaper clippings detailing his glory days stowed away in a shoebox, the amnesiac husband and father finds the article about his career-ending injury. He holds it up next to his recent near-life-ending write-up. And voila! David finally remembers; he remembers remembering, in, you guessed it, a flashback, by which Shyamalan uses slow-motion to accentuate the dawning from his past, in which he had connected the unlikelihood of escaping a fiery car wreck and an injury-free football career. The repressed memory is two-fold. He forgot about his invincibility as both a teenager and an adult. David isn't a superhero. He has CTE. When pressed into action, he half-succeeds. A comic book character saves the whole family, not just the kids. His superhero name should be Good Samaritan. Water isn't his kryptonite. He can't swim.""Split"" is the penultimate film, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" of a science fiction trilogy, in which the sci-fi elements are both atop and asunder the surface, conveyed not just through special effects, but by the ongoing perpetuation of debunked scientific theories being presented as fact. Kevin Wendell Crumb(James McAvoy), a zookeeper inflicted with ""dissociative identity disorder"", ultimately, evolves, consumed by his multiple personalities, especially Dennis, the leader of a group called ""The Horde"", who protects the corporeal vessel they occupy from his repressed memories. Dr. Karen Fletcher(Betty Buckley), Kevin's physician, apparently, did not get the memo that ""Sybil"" was a hoax. The psychiatrist still believes in earnest the theory ""that extreme childhood trauma causes people to repress the traumatic memories by developing 'alters',"" and her patient's case history, child abuse, possibly sexual in nature at the hands of his mother, supports both DID and repressed memory. Although Dr. Fletcher does not have a seat at the table, the American Psychological Association allows the doctor to present her findings to her peers gathered at a summit via Skype. DID critics believe that ""therapists might be helping patients dream up their alters"". Dennis, a presence in Kevin's life since childhood, is an anomaly, since ""multiple personality cases in children are almost nonexistent,"" and also, it's one of Kevin's multiple personalities, not Dr. Fletcher, nor even Kevin himself, who helps create ""The Beast"". In other words, ""Split"" further fictionalizes an already fictional mental disorder. And besides, nobody has actually seen The Beast. Dennis' alter-ego(not Kevin's), described as an amalgamation of wild animals by an anchorwoman on local television, has only one living witness, Casey(Anya Taylor Joy), the proverbial ""final girl"" of the horror genre. It exists only in people's imaginations. For the time being, The Beast could be Bigfoot. People are not fully interpolated in what Anderson calls the ""fantasy-industrial complex"".The Beast goes viral. Superheroes exist, or do they? In a sense, the three inmates in the asylum are ordinary. Elle Staple(Sarah Paulson), a doctor who specializes in patients with comic book hero delusions, at first, seemingly, is like Anderson, a rationalist, but she too has a secret identity. On a meta level, Elle is a fanboy masquerading as a scientist. ""Glass"" is not really a film about good versus evil. It's a film about us. In other superhero films, people would see the zookeeper and the security guard fight each other in person, witnesses that can testify to being bystanders of a miracle, a pulp miracle. Shyamalan introduces the Osaka Building, a setting, the audience thinks, for the final showdown, but in an audacious move, The Beast and The Overseer never get there. The climactic fight takes place in a parking lot next to the asylum. They could just as well be two bar patrons brawling after having too much to drink.Notice how all the people in the subway station look nonplussed at the footage that David's son and his cohorts release online. It could be just another YouTube video. The proliferation of doctored footage on the worldwide web showing religious miracles and people performing super-human feats, in effect, deconstructs the supposed ""real thing"" that purports science fiction to be science fact. We ask ourselves, would we hit ""like"" or ""dislike""? Maybe dislike. After all, neither hero nor villain shoots laser-beams out of their eyes. The video is just another product of the fantasy-industry complex. ""Glass"", ultimately, is a film about the Internet.",Glass

The first act of the movie is underwhelming, there is no coherence & the characters were introduced hastily. McAvoy delivers one of the best performances of this year so far.After a very unimpressive start, the movie starts moving in the right direction after McAvoy & Wills meet. The fight scene was too short but nevertheless perfectly choreographed. The film takes a new turn after the introduction of Sarah Paulson, a doctor who specialises in people who are deluded into believing they are superheroes. The main plot of the film is whether the characters posses special powers or not and the answer is revealed in the 3rd act. Samuel Jackson will be more remembered as Glass rather than Nick Fury.The cinematography is a bit inconsistent & the score is decent but nothing special. Shyamalan should have put in more effort in the dialogue & editing. The narrative is incoherent sometimes & the dialogue is too bland.

272,mitchell5954,Solid But Disappointing,6,7 February 2019,"Glass is the final film in the now Unbreakable Trilogy of Unbreakable, Split, and now this. Glass is a film I was anticipating quite a bit, because I am a long time Shyamalan fan, even if I dislike most of his filmography. I really like Unbreakable, which is his best film in my opinion. I like the Sixth Sense. Signs was my first exposure to him, and I used to love. Now, I think the film is good until it all unravels in the third act. Split, I found to be a really solid psychological thriller. It's definitely Shyamalan's best current movie. So, how did I like Glass? Well, I'll say as sequel to Split it's a worthy follow-up, but as a sequel to Unbreakable it was disappointing.The core plot is simple. David Dunn (Bruce Willis) tracks down the Horde/the Beast (James McAvoy) after the end of Split, and get into a confrontation. Eventually, both wind up in the same mental asylum as Mr. Glass (Samuel L. Jackson). Now Both Mr. Glass and the Horde plot their escape and David Dunn must prevent this.I'll explain what I like about the film first. I will say the first two-thirds of this film are solid, even very good in places. The first thirty minutes are great. David Dunn confronting the Horde is everything I wanted this film to be after the ending of Split. The action, when it's there, is pretty entertaining and well done. The movie looks good, and has a good atmosphere to it, at least in the first two acts. The score is good. I'd say I like the music here more than Split, but it's not as great as Unbreakable's. Everyone in the cast gives a great performance, except for Bruce Willis who sounds like he's half asleep. Though, the script doesn't do him any favors.Many people don't care for the second act in the asylum, but I like it even if it isn't as strong as the first act. There's some good ideas and character building in it. I also like how they brought all of the major characters fromUnbreakable and Split; not just the three main ones, but the side characters like David's son, the main heroine from Split, and even Glass's mother. They even got the same actors to come back, which was cool to see after all these years. I do agree that the second act has some pacing issues. It does drag on a bit too long. Some scenes felt a bit like filler. David's character also barely has anything to do, which is a point I'll get back to in a bit.The third act of the film is where the major issues come into play. Many major critics say that the first two acts are good, but the third is a complete disaster. I wouldn't go that far, because there are some fun action scenes in the third act. But there are many things that don't sit right with me. There is not, one, not two, but three twists at the end; one of them I found really contrived and lame. The ending I found to be too big for a movie like this. Unbreakable, Split, and most of this film have been smaller, more personal stories with is part of what makes them so unique. Plus, I don't buy things going down like they did at the end. It was a bit unrealistic, even for this film.The biggest issue with the third act, and Glass as a whole, is what happens to David Dunn at the end. As someone who loves Unbreakable I was a bit pissed off by the end, I'm not going to lie. I kinda understand what Shyamalan was going for, and this wouldn't be as off-putting for me as it was if David had a compelling character arc that lead to this, or if he simply had more to contribute to the overall narrative. As it is he's simply used as the muscle to fight with the Beast in the first and third acts and little else. He has no character arc. Throughout most of the third act he just disappears and the story focuses primarily on the Horde/the Beast and Mr. Glass. Even David's son has more to do in this than David himself. So what happened to him at the end felt out of nowhere and really soured the experience for me a bit.Overall, Glass is a difficult film to come down on. I'd say it is a solid film. The first two acts are good, and the third has some fun moments in spite of all the faults. Though, it is definitely the weakest of the now Unbreakable Trilogy. Like I said, as a sequel to Split it's fine, but as a follow-up to Unbreakable it's a letdown, in my opinion.",Glass

So, the actors play terrible, Samuel L.

Some of his films start out good, but then go off the tracks somewhere in the 3rd act. Same here. As a matter of fact if you look at the entire trilogy, it's the same. I'm not gonna mention any spoilers but the movie had some potential at the start, despite sluggish dialogue and clumsy exposition. But then after some interesting build-up, the bottom just dropped out.McAvoy's acting was pretty good, but mostly he just did character voices and took his shirt off. No depth though. Accents and acting aren't the same thing, although he does a pretty good imitation of a 9 year old boy.

280,TheGreatMarkukini,Say his name...M. Night Shyamalan,7,8 February 2019,"At this point there can be no spoilers about the crossover of three creations of Shyamalan. The moment, which we were waiting since the ending of the ""Split"" knocks on our door, and it feels like a mailman delivering Christmas gifts.From the start I will zoom on the problems, which are the lack of character story reveal, as many already forgot Bruce Willis' ""Unbreakable"" and another splinter was the actual game of Anya Taylor-Joy that was scattered and uncertain like millions of shards of shattered glass.Anyhow all of that was overruled by once again flawless performance of James McAvoy that still makes you wonder whether he got paid per each character. Mind-blowing cast of Spenser Treat Clark that sends you back in times and the unraveling of much bigger picture in the end simply shows that M. Night Shyamalan is a genius that we don't deserve.The suspense level is lower than the one is ""Split"" but the amount of stuff happening is enormous. The question, which I cannot stop asking myself is whether Shyamalan planned this from the beginning or he has just found some unshown footage from 2000 and decided to unveil it with a use of two movies. In any case I thank him for such a great job.",Glass

Besides James McAvoy acting, the movie is out of trailer expectation. The plots are predictable and the characters are not so awful. It is more showing that Identity Disorder is supernatural comic ability which is for me is so illogical. Then, the appearance of some secret society to vanish the unique people, makes me remember the Novel of Miss Peregrine and Peculiar Children. This movie has no link with the development of science to deal with identity disorder people and has no real clue about what going on in their mind could impact the society of Internet. At the end of the movie, you could see that people is going not care with them, even though they finally see their fantastic ability. Some reviewers said this is the best trilogy, but for me.

283,garethvk,An Interesting New Entry Into The Series,7,17 January 2019,"It is hard to believe it has been 19 years since ""Unbreakable"" arrived in cinemas as the film seemed to setup a sequel but it did not look like it would come to fruition. That all changed in 2016 when ""Split"" arrived and shocked audiences with a late reveal that showed a connection to the film. Writer/Director M. Night Shyamalan has wasted no time in bringing the new film to fans with the arrival of ""GLASS"". The film picks up soon after the events of ""Split"" as The Horde embodied by 23 personalities in the form of Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy) continues to kidnap young girls to serve to his highly dangerous 24th personality The Beast.
Security expert David Dunn (Bruce Willis) along with the help of his son attempts to locate the Horde as a new group of girls has gone missing. In time David locates The Beast and the two clash; but end up captured by authorities and sent to a facility for evaluation.
Their captive Dr. Ellie Staple (Sarah Paulson) believes their special abilities are in their minds and that they really do not have the special abilities they believe they do. Each of them have a special cell designed to restrain them as David is under threat of being doused with water while Kevin has a series of strobes which will halt him and trigger a new personality.
Added to the mix is Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson), who has been at the facility under heavy sedation after the events of ""Unbreakable"".
As the therapy unfolds it becomes clear that an elaborate game of cat and mouse is underway between Price and her charges as each seems to have their own agenda. This all builds to a very unusual final act which left me pondering if I enjoyed the final result or was disappointed with it.
The film seems to slowly be building to a big finale but yet it is far more restrained than one would expect. The film has a constant theme of Super Heroes and their traditional stories and roles as well as that of their Super Villains.
One expects a massive Battle Royale complete with elaborate FX but the film takes a more restrained approach and in doing so may disappoint some fans while pleasing others. The film naturally has its twist moments and while I will not spoil it, I can say I predicted it before I even saw the film. When I saw ""Split"" I actually told my wife my theory and low and behold it was true. I also predicted the twists for many of Shyamalan's previous films so I had hoped for a bit more in this regard. The film does offer up some interesting options for another sequel or Spin-Off and the cast was very good especially McAvoy who adds to his menagerie of characters by showing audiences a few more of the ones previously undisclosed.
The film is at times very enjoyable and at times a bit frustrating as it seems to deviate from themes and elements that were setup earlier. That being said it does very much appear that this could indeed be just the start of something much bigger in the series.

Nope, sorry. Not one reason popped into my head.The masterful subtlety from Unbreakable smashed to smithereens; comic book this, superhero that, superhero this, comic book that. You would think they had filmed this for those who are oblivious to the obvious. Spelling it out for us at every opportunity.The masterful acting whittled into a dogfight for who can seem

288,scott-sw,"Not all good, but not all bad",7,19 January 2019,"Glass is one of those movie that usually makes me nervous. It was made by M. Night Shyamalan, which is enough said. While most his material took a nosedive after Signs, it seemed to get a slight shot in the arm with The Visit and Split.
Now, we have Glass - a sequel suddenly ushered in for the closing chapter in a trilogy. It is the follow up to Split, which was also a hidden follow-up to Unbreakable, probably Shyamalan's most underrated movie.
It is almost 20 years since David Dunn (Bruce Willis) realized his bones were unbreakable and his awareness was awakened by the nefarious Elijah Price (Samuel Jackson). David, with his son, Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark), owns a security system shop. Meanwhile, David works with Joseph in finding criminals and bringing them to justice.
He wants to find The Horde (James McAvoy). The Horde is the group of personalities within him: Patricia, Kevin, Hedwig, Dennis, the Beast, etc). He does and as he brings the monster out in the open, both are captured by police and taken into psychiatric custody into the same facility with Elijah Price, aka Mr. Glass. Now comes the Psychiatrist, Dr. Ellie Staple (Lauren Paulson), who specializes in the neurosis of people who think they are superheros (or super villains). She tries to convince them they are average human beings.
Meanwhile, Joseph tries to get his father out of the hospital while Casey (Anya-Taylor Joy) wants to confront the man who captured and tormented her in Split. Also entering the cast is Elijah's mother, Mrs. Price (Charlayne Woodard).
The movie has some things that are intriguing - as to how the cast members and stories from Unbreakable and Split come together for a common purpose. And they give good, credible performances - especially McAvoy. Shyamalan's direction also gives us a coherent story amid a glut of good characters, and stories that come together.
However, lacking is the tension and fear missing from previous Shyamalan films. Personally, I think the film was marketed incorrectly as an action movie, whereas, like Unbreakable, it is more of a drama and a mystery. Also, the screenplay became a little disjointed at the end as he tried to do a little too much, including a character breaking the fourth wall not once, but three times. Also, there were two plot twists at the end. While one of them brings new light to a situation and works well, the other one is rather forced, and falls into the category of absurd.
Glass is no Sixth Sense or Unbreakable, but it is not The Happening or Lady in the Water, either. Overall, I recommend it. Just do not expect something spectacular.",Glass

290,Benslie,Could've been better,7,20 January 2019,"First of all, all three of the main leads did marvellous jobs as their characters. Now I haven't seen Unbreakable yet but I still felt like I understood everything that David and Elijah stood for. I had already seen Split, the other movie in this series, so I already knew how great James McAvoy would be in this movie. He just brings so much energy to each and every single personality making them all seem like a different person. Some of the side characters though didn't stand out as much for me and just seemed two dimensional. One of them being the doctor. She had no major character development and just seemed like a last minute addition. Spencer Treat Clark, who plays Joseph Dunn, brought nothing to the film and just seemed really bland. Just like any M. Night Shyamalan, there is a plot twist but in this film, there isn't just one, not two but three. One of them is actually really good and will shock people but the other two are just dumb and should've just been taken out. This film is two hours and six minutes long and man does it feel longer than that. There were some parts that were enticing for me and brought me into the story but a majority of the film had me zoning out a lot. The film had my attention for one of the final scenes in the film and that was really it. This film feels like three different movies as well. There were some awkward transitions in this film and some weird moments where the camera was shaking. In the end, Glass in a decent film that I think could have and should've been better.",Glass

I was so upset when I saw her, but alas, I plowed through, and just to find that she did not tarnish the movie. I loved this movie.

292,jb07-660-944395,A burnt offering,2,20 January 2019,"The curse of written and directed by....but worse. Because the writer has had two previously mildly successful movies, he thinks he can do what he wants, and does. Unbreakable was unbearably slow, James Macavoy single handedly saved Split, and Glass should have been called shattered - because that's how you will feel when leaving the cinema.Glass is proof that even with big name actors like Bruce Willis, Samuel Jackson and James Macavoy, if you don't have a good script, the movie is going to fail. Yes, I get it, this isn't a super hero movie. It's a self indulgent mess.The ending should be used as a shining example to other script writers on how not to end a movie.

293,antoniokowatsch,Not the finale I imagined,7,31 January 2019,"This review will contain spoilers because they're necessary to properly analyze the movie.This movie is the long-awaited finale to the previous superhero-themed M. Night Shyamalan movies ""Unbreakable"" and ""Split"". And storytelling-wise this movie sits somewhere in the middle. It's not as good as ""Unbreakable"" but it is better than ""Split"". Just to be perfectly clear about it, this is not exactly the finale I was envisioning.It seemed rather slow in the beginning. Pacing-wise we were constantly teased with the foreshadowing of what is about to happen; ""the clash"" of the protagonists. And then when it finally happened I couldn't help but feel a little underwhelmed. I mean, the movie consists almost entirely of torture scenes. You could literally comprise the movie in one sentence like so; ""the protagonists get tortured and then they escape and die"".And to be quite frank I don't quite get why that woman was torturing the protagonists at all. It didn't make any sense in my humble opinion. I mean, what exactly was the organization gaining by mentally torturing superheroes before killing them? Nothing.
They could've just killed them right away and get on with it. That would've been more efficient aka economically viable than toying with them. It's almost a deal-breaker for me. I mean, it's not like I can't stomach torture scenes but if you're going to torture someone you have to make it seem believable. This just made no sense whatsoever. Sorry.As I alluded earlier the end was a little disappointing in my humble opinion.
Yes, it made more sense this way but I honestly thought that the final showdown of the protagonists would result in Dunn's son realizing that he has superpowers too ergo him becoming ""Whispererman"". I mean, he picked up a comic at the comic book store after his father died which was titled ""Whispererman"". I don't know, maybe I'm just overthinking it.
Or maybe M. Night Shyamalan's next movie is going to be titled Whispererman and that scene was just a foreshadowing of what is yet to come. Who knows?Unbreakable is one of my favorite movies and I don't think this was a worthy end for the protagonists. I mean, I kinda started to like these guys and then they get killed. What the hell?!",Glass
294,ryanwinning1,Glass was an Epic Flop! Painful to watch!,4,17 May 2019,"I really think Shyamalan completely missed the tone he was going for in this movie. I don't think it helped that right out of the gate within 5 minutes of the movie starting Shyamalan does a Tarintino style cameo himself that can only be described as comedic. This movie is bad, but I understand that there is a few reasons why I shouldn't be too critical of it. 1. Budget and 2. timing of Unbreakable. I really enjoyed Unbreakable and thought that Glass was a huge step down from the quality of the original film in this series. Unbreakable had a much higher budget, and it also came out at a time when movie goers were begging for any kind of superhero movie. Today the film world is bombarded with superhero movies so I think it takes a heck of a lot more to impress me and movie-fans alike than it did back when Unbreakable came out. They were trying to be original with Glass, but it came out pretty lame.Sadly, I think the primary goal of this movie was to cash in on the previous movies success using a very small budget and they did exactly that. By doing that it was disappointing to both the fans that expect huge explosions and life-like CGI, but really I think the writing was so rushed that it also disappoints the type of fan who can use their imagination to follow along with a good story. This was a bad story though. The lady that plays the psychologist was super boring. I didn't like her performance at all. Bruce Willis clearly stepped back and allowed the light to shine on McAvoy which I think was a mistake. Every chance that Shyamalan gives to an amateur actor to make the movie more impactful completely backfires and destroys the mood and tone. The lady that plays Elijah's mother was cast really to method-act however it was evident that she couldn't leave her real life self at the door.I think this movie would have been completely different if it was double the budget, but on the other hand I don't know if it would have made double the profit or even made equal the profit that this low budget film brought in if they threw more money at the story. I was really disappointed by this cash grab.",Glass

296,Irena_Spa,Suffering,4,15 September 2019,"Shyamalan should consider rewriting the script and make a deep researching of comic-books and their characters. We don't see some connection between his 3 main characters, but at the end it seems that there is. Why then the name ""Glass"" if it isn't transparent in any angle?! During watching we don't know who is good and who is bad in it? Do we see killings or it is just our imagination that there were some, but not for real?!

298,andrewmerritt-31652,"Not M Night Shyamalan's best work, but still entertaining.",6,27 January 2019,"Glass stars Bruce Willis, Samuel L Jackson, and James McAvoy. After the events of Split, Bruce Willis uses his abilities to track down James McAvoy who has twenty-four personalities. I should start off by saying that this is the third movie after Unbreakable and Split so before you watch this you should watch Unbreakable and Split to fully understand Glass. We also get to see Samuel L Jackson return as he is resting in a mental hospital after the events of Unbreakable. And I really like the creativity and the imagination of M. Night Shyamalan as he had an idea of how to wrap up the Unbreakable trilogy. While it may not be the best M Night Shyamalan movie unlike his pervious films I do like how he really wanted to bring his passion project to the big screen. Unfortunately the problem I had with Glass is the pacing issues as the first ten minutes I feel were pointless. And after those ten minutes are up we focus on the mental hospital where Bruce Willis, James McAvoy, and Samuel L Jackson are being held. The movie should've taken place in the mental hospital because that's where the movie got interesting. And I think I would be an interesting concept if the other patients were involved, as it would explore more of the hospital and the possibility that other superheroes and villains exist besides the three main characters. I'd be lying if I said that James McAvoy carried the movie from beginning to end as he brings back his intensity and scariness back. One thing that I do like about this is how they take rules from comic book movies and how M Night Shyamalan makes it into his own comic book movie that has no relations to the D.C. or Marvel franchise. However, if M Night Shyamalan does decide to create his own comic book franchise he really need to work on his pacing schedule. So in the end, Glass is a film that is worth experiencing in the theatre and it may not be the best M Night Shyamaln film, but it's still worth the watch.",Glass

Jackson kept going in about bringing out their full potential but neither McAvoy or Willis really do anything that spectacular. Some feats of strength but that is about it. Really I'm sure they could find some experts to debunk the whole ""super abilities"" shown. I really don't get why she was freaking out (I mean I get why they wrote it that way but seems like a bad choice."". Even killing off all the stars seems like such a bad decision if you wanted to start a new universe. The part that irked me the most was the finale when they released the videos to the world.

301,WooderIce64,Good with the right mindset,7,5 June 2019,"M. Night Shyamalan is Hollywood's definition of hit-or-miss. Sixth Sense is undeniably a great film, but you also have Last Airbender and After Earth. Glass is the surprise sequel to both Split and Unbreakable, which was released 19 years ago. It focuses on David Dunn (Bruce Willis, from Unbreakable), Kevin Crumb (James McAvoy, also known as The Horde, from Split), and Elijah Price, also known as Mr. Glass (Samuel L. Jackson, from Unbreakable). The performances from that trio are great, especially James McAvoy playing all of the different personalities that reside within him.The whole idea is that the three of them are taken to a mental hospital of sorts where they become a case study in people who think they're superheroes. It's an interesting premise, but it only works if the audience is in the right mindset. A lot of people went into this expecting it to be an action movie and were surprised when it wasn't. It's a character study of the three of them, with Mr. Glass taking control in the second half. Each one shows his strengths throughout the film. Mr. Glass is as intelligent as always. The idea of Dunn's powers being as psychological as they are physical was interesting. The Horde was a pleasure to watch, as McAvoy's performance was very good.As with most Shyamalan movies, you have your twist. Here, it's that there's a secret society that kills people with special abilities, and that was their plan all along. Mr. Glass caught onto this, and manages to expose himself, Dunn, and the Horde to the world. Given that this was, in fact, a trilogy, killing off the main cast made sense, but the deaths mostly seemed anticlimactic. There's also a mini-twist that the Horde's father died on the train Mr. Glass crashed back in Unbreakable, which is kinda dumb. Another thing noticeable about this movie is that with the twist, it makes you feel like it needs to be watched again. Does that sound like another Shyamalan movie?One thing that's worth noting for me personally is that this movie, like most Shyamalan movies, is set in Philadelphia, my hometown. For me, seeing my hometown on the big screen was really quite exciting, even if there has been an uptick of Philly movies recently. One of my friend's co-workers is actually in this movie, which blew his mind when we saw this in the theater. By the way, drowning in a pothole is the most ""Pennsylvania"" way to die imaginable. The whole damn state is covered in potholes every winter.",Glass
302,michaelgarykelley1994,"Wow, What A Letdown",5,21 January 2019,"Admittedly, I am not the biggest Shyamalan fan. Oddly, I consider his best film to be ""The Visit""-it's just so much more fun and eerie than any of his other films, for my taste. Since ""The Visit"" had come out, it seemed as though the man, the myth, the legend was back, crafting solid flicks, again. I saw ""Split"" the weekend it was released, a couple of years after seeing (and barely enjoying) the first film in the series, ""Unbreakable"". I enjoyed ""Split"" immensely, due to James' performance of a man named Kevin, whom suffers from a multiple personalities disorder, who kept claiming there was a more evil personality called The Beast coming to feast upon the many girls he had kidnapped.My mother and I were pretty pumped to see ""Glass"". Tonight was opening weekend's Sunday, and I must say we both walked-out severely disappointed-her moreso than I.The film is ridiculously slow, and I'm fine with that. It's just that the conclusion to the flick-or its entire third act, for that matter-never picked-up the pace into something iconic, or memorable, even for the hardcore fan base (which I would not consider myself a part of, to begin with). The first two acts were solid and enjoyable, in my opinion. But that ending . . . whew, what a wreck. We're not even doing the tradition of having one big twist at the end of a Shyamalan film; instead, there are three or four (I lost track). But the BIGGEST reveal was horrendously stupid, and almost acts as a way to continue the story without having to have any more films made. I won't spoil that for you, however.The performances are what this trilogy tends to be all about. However, after seeing all three movies, it's obvious that the person with the most care and deservance of praise was James. He killed it here, just like he did in ""Split."" He's honestly too good for this movie, or for most film series and performances he ends-up getting attached to, like Professor Xavier in the current ""X-Men"" movies. So many of the original cast members from ""Unbreakable"" and ""Split"" are brought back, here, and I really enjoyed the less-focused-upon cast members-especially the young man who plays Bruce Willis' son. Bruce is fine as David Dunn. Sam Jackson is fine as Mr. Glass, whom doesn't talk much, in the film. Even the lady with the lisp from ""American Horror Story"" is really decent, for what she's given to work with. So the cast was solid, all-in-all.The dialogue and the scene development in the writing were good. Especially James' many characters. God, that man can act. He does so much with these many personalities, and I believe it to be more him than the writer(s). I know a lot of people are complaining about not getting much of Jackson or Willis, but I thought we were given just enough of them, to balance-out all of these characters we were following. I do also like that David Dunn has sort of acquired a superhero name, through the newspapers. The Overseer. Very interesting name, if I do say so myself.I will say that I think the score wasn't really utilized too much. I heard a little bit of the theme from the original film, but I don't even remember much music being in the film at all.The cinematography was okay. Nothing special, like in ""Unbreakable"".The intelligence behind the way things were shown to us through the clever directing in the first film isn't here, whatsoever. For you arthouse film fanatics, I can tell you, already, to lower your standards about what you're getting via directing. There ain't much to be had or considered.""Glass"" is a very, VERY mixed bag-especially the final reveal of the film. It's flawed, but I'd recommend seeing it to those folks who enjoy the first two flicks in the (possibly, only for now) trilogy. You might just like this one more than I did, by the end. I don't hate it, but I'm not close to loving it. I don't even understand Sam Jackson's motivations, by the end of the film.What a messy movie. I'm really bothered to see things go this way. Fans deserved better than this, in my opinion.",Glass

305,eparazak,I guess you could say I'm Split on Glass.,5,24 January 2019,"I'm not apologizing for the pun, I think it's gold. Anyway, this movie is meant to be the conclusion to the Eastrail 177 trilogy. It follows David Dunn as he continues to track down Kevin Wendell Crumb. While doing so, they are both imprisoned in a mental hospital by Dr. Ellie Staple.I'm very polarized by this movie. Admittedly, the premise kicks off really well. It's simply about David Dunn trying to wind Kevin Wendell Crumb and I found the setup to be the funnest part to watch. We essentially are watching what we knew from Unbreakable and Split come together. With all that being said, the second act really seemed to overstay its welcome.Most of the movie takes place in this psychiatric hospital and it leads the two as well as Elijah Price to have to question their supernatural powers. Admittedly, this is a neat idea, but it doesn't seem like it gets us very far into the film. This act, while adding a little bit of substantial lore, doesn't do much to answer those questions. It really does feel like that second act drags, especially with these qualities in mind.With that being said, I love every performance in this film. From Bruce Willis as David Dunn to Samuel L Jackson as Elijah Price, and especially James McAvoy as Kevin. All of these performances are fantastic and Shyamalan really nailed it in this category. Even the secondary characters' actors do a great job in making their characters feel believable. For instance, with Spencer Treat Clark, who was in Unbreakable by the way, trying to prove that his dad is not crazy and Anya Taylor-Joy trying to help Kevin Wendell Crumb out. It all feels really believable and is easily among my favorite qualities of the movie.With all that being said, I thought the third act ruined the movie. This is because of the twist ending. It felt shoehorned in and there seemed to be no hints of this revelation. I mean with some of Shyamalan's other movies, they had hints of said twist hidden into the film. This one on the other hand doesn't seem to have that, which makes it feel confusing at best and insulting at worst. At the very least, I like that it took a risk, especially one that few superhero movies today are trying.I found this movie very polarizing, which is odd considering that I really liked Split and Unbreakable. I just wish that the plot was executed better. In a sense, I was a little let down.5/10",Glass

307,Martinito_08183,The biggest disappointment of 2019.,4,9 August 2019,"M. Night Shyamalan's ""Glass"" is the most disappointing and underwhelming movie of 2019. There were many aspects that didn't work or are very poorly executed and one of them was of course the story, which has moments that are very weak and questionable at the same time. There are still some ideas and elements that are intriguing, but there are also some missed opportunities; some of the ideas are not explored further and the characters that everyone were invested in got the most weakest and unsatisfying ending you could possibly imagine.",Glass
308,Kirollos-Noah,"Underrated, but disappointing.",7,23 February 2019,"Glass is directed and written by M. Night Shyamalan, with a simple role as we saw him in Unbreakable and Split. Starring James McAvoy, Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, Anya Taylor-Joy and Sarah Paulson.
Bruce Willis returns as David Dunn as does Samuel L. Jackson as Elijah Price, known also by his pseudonym Mr. Glass. Joining from Split are James McAvoy, reprising his role as Kevin Wendell Crumb and the multiple identities who reside within, and Anya Taylor-Joy as Casey Cooke, the only captive to survive an encounter with The Beast. Following the conclusion of Split, Glass finds Dunn pursuing Crumb's superhuman figure of The Beast in a series of escalating encounters, while the shadowy presence of Price emerges as an orchestrator who holds secrets critical to both men.Glass was one of my anticipating movies list since I watched Split and surprisingly reveal that it's a sequel to the 2000's Unbreakable, which I liked. So yeah, I was very excited to see these three characters gathering together in one movie.. sadly it's the last movie of that trilogy.. and we will get to that ending in the spoiler review. But for now, let's do the spoiler-free review!Okay, as the title says ""Underrated, but disappointing"" the movie is underrated, but let me say that it's not, because not everyone is gonna like this movie.. yeah, maybe underrated, but still disappointing. The first act of this movie was pretty cool, I loved it, the third act also is pretty, no no.. the final fight, because it was pretty epic I enjoyed it very much.. the conclusion and the ending were a little bit messy, the twist was cool, but the ""character"" wasn't that convincing, and I felt like it's not how this character should've been, because it reminded me with Unbreakable, and how it was rushed, Glass is giving us a little more surprising one, but not well crafted.The second act is my biggest flaw with this movie, it was super slow, and confusing.. like how Glass is getting out of his cage? How is he just getting in any room he wants with no keys? Also it's not what you wanted to see from these characters, especially Anya Taylor-Joy, I loved her in Split, but in this one.. she's just there. I mean Spencer Treat Clark had a better role in this movie. Sarah Paulson is also bad, I didn't like her character which was ""You're not that, you're that!"", even her performance was emotionless and in the second act she was just there to go to a room from a room to say and to give us info we already know or ones that we don't care about! So yeah, the second act was new for this trilogy,but still it lacks a lot!James McAvoy is pretty good in this movie just as he was in Split, once more he's the best thing in the movie but I have a flaw with it, which is a spoiler so, I'm gonna talk about it in the spoiler review... Bruce Willis is very good as well, but I have the same flaw which I found with James McAvoy's character, but even more! Samuel L. Jackson is not there most of the movie, but once he's there, he gave the movie a good spirit!! He has also one of the best scenes in the whole trilogy, as we saw in the trailer, when he was moving with his wheelchair and the beast the killing some people behind him, that was pretty cool!Glass disappointed me, but still it's a fresh movie and I'm gonna give it a positive grade, don't get me wrong, but I like Split more, but in the mean while, I liked it a little bit more than Unbreakable. I'm gonna give Glass a B!Thank you, guys as always for reading my review, look forward for my spoiler review, and if you liked it, you can click on my name up above and read my other reviews.",Glass

Okay, if you're reading this, please, go and read my spoiler-free review, because I'm not gonna repeat the same stuff, I'm just gonna talk about the spoiler stuff.. and if you didn't watch the movie, go and read the spoiler-free review to not get the spoiled and ruined to you, otherwise.. welcome!Okay, if you read the spoiler-free review, so you know that I liked the movie, but I didn't like the ending that much, why is that?! Because it's such a waste to see these amazing three characters dying if front of you in a very weak and rushed way! It felt like M. Night is just wanted to end them really quickly, or he was just busy to make it epic or longer at least -Just kidding-... The only kill that made me cry hard, and it was fine, the kill of Kevin.. it was very emotional, well made and perfectly acted by James McAvoy! Glass's death was not well crafted, but at least better than the death of David, which was truly disappointing to see him dying in a water spot, and then we see the reveal of the true villain, which has no good backstory, awkward scene but with an acceptable motivation for Dr. Ellie to do what she has done!Also I didn't like the second act, as I said why before, but there's a spoiler thing I had to say, there was a scene when Dr. Ellie was talking with David, then to Kevin.. just to say some useless info! Also the convention was weird, the proofs that Dr. Ellie said weren't convincing, maybe Kevin's were okay, but with David, it wasn't.. and he believed it!What I really liked but I couldn't say before is, there was a flashback of David and his son, and it's talking about David going into his son's room after the lifting scene from Unbreakable, and it was a deleted scene from Unbreakable actually, and I really like the idea of putting it in Glass!These are my spoiler-thoughts on Glass, as you know I gave it a B so it's positive, but still disappointing!Thank you as always for reading and supporting my work, and if you liked it, you can click on my name up above to see all of my reviews, and the upcoming ones!",Glass
310,robinsonaustin-07490,When High Expectations Go Awry,5,29 January 2019,"M. Night Shymalan is admittedly not one of my favorite film directors. While I do appreciate that he has some creativity when it comes to his films and chooses to go with his vision despite others not really agreeing with it, I feel that his films took a major dip towards being objectively bad. His latest film, Glass, is something that I personally felt was an okay, but flawed film. In it, the film concerns David, Kevin Wendell Crumb, and Elijah Price being taken to an institution whose main goal is to try to convince the patients that they are actually delusional. It does start off as something actually thought-provoking, and the explanations that were given did make sense in some ways. For the remainder of the movie though, there will be SPOILERS. BE WARNED.So, as per usual, Shymalan loves his twists. Here, we have a whopping three twists. The first two are kind of average, but the third one was especially bad. In the first one, we learn that Kevin's father was one of the many casualties of the train wreck masterminded by Elijah ""Mr. Glass"" Price in the first of the trilogy Unbreakable. So in the same train accident that awakened David's potential, Mr. Glass had inadvertently created the Horde. Okay. Since Split had Kevin mention briefly that his father died in a train accident, it makes sense. But then came the more insulting twist.It turns out that Dr. Ellie Sharpe (had to look up her name) was actually secretly a member of an Illuminati-esque organization that had apparently existed for THOUSANDS OF YEARS. WHAT!? The reason as to why there hadn't been any other individuals similar to the three aforementioned? Because this secret society was dedicated to suppressing those with superhuman abilities from emerging because that would inevitably lead to superheroes and supervillains which would endanger the lives of civilians whether by gaslighting them into believing that they are just delusional, or outright genocide. Aside from some officers having clover tattoos on their wrists, there was little to no indication that a secret organization existed. This of course goes into another issue that I have: the deaths. In short, all three characters are killed off. David is drowned in a puddle of water that isn't even an inch deep, Kevin is shot, Mr. Glass gets his shoulder shattered, etc. While I respect Shymalan for not taking the course of action that many had thought he would, the fact that he allows his characters to die in such undignified fashion is shameful.There are other issues the film has such as Mr. Glass not appearing in the film until about 30 minutes in or how the action scenes where David and Kevin dual off are bland. I'm not expecting any MCU or DCEU style action, but at most, they jump out of a window. The young woman from Split returns and apparently holds no ill will towards Kevin for murdering her friends in the previous film. I mean, she treats Kevin almost as if he was a beaten down puppy. Yes, Kevin had his own reasons for why he became the way he was, but he is STILL dangerous because of his many personalities. But the worst has to do with the ending.Turns out that Mr. Glass's plan involving the new building was a misdirect. He was never planning on leaving the institution. Instead, he hacks into the facility's computer surveillance cameras and uses that to download footage of David and Kevin's fight and after his death, the survivors upload it to the internet, thus many people began to wake up to the reality of supers. Okay...while Mr. Glass is undoubtedly highly intelligent, this plan doesn't really make any sense. many videos can be easily edited to accentuate what is actually going on. So, even if people saw the video of the brawl? Wouldn't it be more likely that some would assume that is a well-crafted, edited video? Would anyone seriously think anything they saw on the internet was true? It just comes off as very flawed, even for Mr. Glass.There are some good moments in the film such as Mr. Glass's interactions with his mother and how she is really the only one to understand him. James McAvoy once again stole the show through his character of Kevin Wendell Crumb, and Samuel L. Jackson is once again great as Mr. Glass once he started to get back in his game. Other than that, it was disappointing, but only if you had high expectations.",Glass

He works with the surprise factor, making the plot events unexpected. At first, it is a little difficult to understand what it is about. You get a little lost in the story until, halfway through the end, you come to understand it. Here's another direction from M. Night Shyamalan. This director likes to work with suspense and psychological terror. He often creates interesting movies even on a low budget and without much special effect or big productions. I remember another of his films, The Village (2004). The Glass (2019) follows in the same genre as Thriller. I highlight the performance of James McAvoy. Very good interpretation of the character.

318,Nathan_Needs_A_Username,Movie Review: Glass,6,6 April 2019,"Well... this movie has absolutely broken me.For context Unbreakable is one of my favourite movies of all time. Shyamalan was clearly ahead of the curve by deconstructing the standard comic book narrative only five months after the release of the first X-Men movie. The slow pace and highly intentional camera work make for a very entreating character study.Split really caught me of guard back in 2017. James McAvoy's performance being a highlight of the year and the reveal of David Dunn at the end lead to some great discussions about how the two stories would connect.So now just two years after that revel but a whole nineteen years after Unbreakable Shyamalan brings us the concluding chapter to his comic book inspired trilogy.Having seen the critical response before going in I wasn't expecting much but for the first two thirds I really could not tell what the problem was. All of the performances were great. Bruce Willis coming of the back of years worth of disappointing performances seemed to actually care about his character. Samuel L. Jackson shows his ability to showcase a characters entire thought process with just the rise of an eyebrow and James McAvoy is so good at switching between personalities that moments in this film exist for the sole purpose of letting his show off.The camera work kept me on edge the whole time, Shyamalan utilises every trick he has ever pulled of from hand-help tracking shots, point of view shots, panning shots reminiscent of his every work of Unbreakable and Signs and absolutely wonderful one takes that allow for McAvoy fully showcase the potential of his character(s). The more minor roles are also handled really well with Taylor-Joy returning as Casey Cooke adding to her wonderful performance from Split and Spencer Treat Clark making me question why he hasn't had the chance to show just how great an actor he can be since his appearance in Unbreakable. Sarah Paulson is also far more important to this film than I had first presumed and her character has some great moments and aided by her subtle and purposeful performance.But eventually you have to get the the finale. Without spoiling anything I am not a fan of the way this film concludes. To me it appears as if Shyamalan wanted a bigger reveal to justify the existence of the film and it just does not work.The typically Shyamalan ending only serves to highlight some other issues I had with the film, particularly how underused the character of David Dunn was and how Shyamalan clearly cares more about the plot and characters in Split than Unbreakable begging the question of why this film had to exist and why It is called Glass when that character doesn't do or say anything for about an hour of the movie.Most of Glass is good, some of Glass is great but it never quite lives up to it's full potential. Its worth seeing to round of the trilogy and maybe that ending will grow on me over time.Great performances across the board and bold, unique direction but ultimately unsatisfying.6/10",Glass

No Promises!First things 1st James McAvoy is got to be one of THE BEST actors I've seen in a long time. He puts the epitome of acting all within these few movies with 20 characters...... Yes TWENTY Characters in one; from one! Simply AMAZING!I can't say much cause I'm yet to see the 1st part ""Unbroken"" then ""Split"" I've seen & now ""Glass"" yet I feel I have a lot of the puzzle, but KNOW I'm missing some of it. This collection of movies u really have to pay attention to cause there is hints nearly everywhere about everything & just about blink u'll missed a lot.
My thing is that is leaving me wonder.....
1.) What is this ""cult"" & where the heck did they come from if they seemed to have been a theoretical system seeing that this so called ""Dr. Ellie Staple"" explained to her colleagues that ""the 3 r real""... What made them start this theoretical ideology so strong heartedly that they put others lives on lock-down, pain, &/or killed just to test their theories?
2.) What the HECK is this machine she is talking about?
3.) Before she realized there was a leak thanx to the genius plays by Mr. Glass... Then y would she claim there was no witnesses when there was 3 still alive that we know for a FACT is not a part of this ""cult"".... Casey Cook (from Split/Kevin's possible ""girlfriend"" lol), Joseph Dunn (David Dunn's son), & Mrs. Price (Glasses Mother).
4.) This series is NOT over! There has to be an ""original"" psycho/superhuman that started the whole ""cult"" thing & who is going to be the new Superhero/Villain/Psycho?
5.) Make sure to watch them all from Unbreakable to Split then Glass... Or u will/may end up missing something.EDIT Update:
Wait a second...... I think I figured out what may be some what puzzling me. Is it a movie error, or will it be a part of the next film?
At the end all had witnessed the situation in a whole & mainly that David Dunn was trying to save the cops, the girls, & attempting to stop ""The Beast""....
So0o0o0o0o how many had witnessed the murder of David Dunn by Dr. Ellie Staple & her colleague.....
Shouldn't they be held accountable for murder & put in jail? Whether David Dunn was innocent or not! Now will this be played out in the next film, or will the go down as a movie mistake? I'm guessing as a movie mistake.",Glass

All of the excitement was shown in the trailer, and the parts we didn't see were just puffed up dialogue trying to be poignant.

However the ending to his made me feel like I wasted over nearly two decades being into the lure and story.If it is a ""comic book"" type movie, the the ending ruins it.

By all this above I am talking about how all three characters die in the end (Dunn, Glass and Beast). I could maybe handle the fact they died if the movie ended there. But to add this stuff about a secret organization with tattoos they have and more stuff about the videos being released to the world to start a future of heroes vs villians... it made me not care since there are no more movies after this.

In this movie the three main players come together to the same path and this is where M. Night Shyamalan does his magic, because this is probably one of those movie that we need right now.

Surrounded as we are with Marvel and DC movies, this ""superheroes"" movie comes nearer to reality than any of those.Needless to say that the acting is flawless with three big names as Willis, Jackson and McAvoy. The three of them steal the show from the other, with McAvoy doing a bigger job due to his ""bigger personality"".

We watch these movies just to distract yourself. After watching these movies, since there is no reality about life, we only have the excitement that we feel while watching the movie. Mr. Glass film looked at this subject from a different window. He made a delusion that superheroes are real. He did not exaggerate the heroes in the movie.

Like a disease is traced by its symptoms, the destroying of people and their reputations contain its own footprints.

But the direction for this movie was to cut away almost every single time he transitioned! Uugghh! So frustrating! The first half of the movie was dull and the second half wasn't much better.

I was hoping I wouldn't be disappointed and it lived up to that expectation. Although I never did get a chance to see Unbreakable, this film did not have me feeling I missed anything by not seeing it. I would, however, reccommend seeing Split before seeing this one. James McAvoy plays his characters so well and obviously is by far my favorite, but I also enjoyed seeing an appearance of Anya's character Casey.I think James McAvoy's characters is what makes this movie what it is. He is undeniably great at bringing each of his different personalities to life in a way not many actors can.The plot was a bit confusing at times and I still think I may have to watch it again to get every detail, but it all sort of came together at the end. The only thing I wasn't expecting was to be sad with the ending and the ultimate end to the characters, specifically the final moment with ""Casey"" and James' characters.Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson's characters were great as well. I don't know that they compare to James', but they still added to it all.I've always had a fascination for M. Night Shyamalan's movies, but he has exceeded my expectations for these last two and would have to put it in the category of one of my all time favorites.

Bruce is as Bruce always has been; somewhat cardboard but that is how he has always been. Samuel L. Jackson is as he is always; a masterpiece of acting prowess!I did get the feel that this was a somewhat low budget production, the sets and the 'extras' (props as well) appeared to be a case of 'whatever we can get' (ish) but that didn't detract from the overall experience to a sufficiently large enough degree to cast it into b status! Although the extremely limited effects could have been produced using an iPhone!As far as story goes M. Night did it again! The twist, turn and plot direction was tip top. Although we have long since moved into the 'that is exactly what I expected of him' state, he still pulls it off. It leaves you with the ultimate feeling that you will agree there was something that you didn't really foresee and frankly that is what makes him a great writer.Synopsis: not worth getting excited about but well worth the watch. Great acting by all and extremely great acting by McAvoy.

Samuel L. Jackson is Mr. Glass and we're all set for the for the final climactic showdown - or are we?The beauty of this is it's different and while M.

349,rustonreviews,Brilliant but frustrating.,6,21 January 2019,"To this day, Unbreakable (2000) remains one of M. Night's best films. Upon the release of Split in 2016, nobody would have guessed that the final scene would reveal its true identity as a secret sequel to Unbreakable, paving the way for the conclusion of the Eastrail 177 Trilogy with Glass, a film 19 years in the making. It's always satisfying to see a filmmaker's ultimate passion project come together, and the anticipation for Glass was staggeringly high. Taking place 19 years after Unbreakable and 3 weeks after Split, we're reunited with David Dunn (Willis), who now operates as the hooded vigilante known by the media as The Overseer, protecting people from petty criminals with the help of his son Joseph. Dunn's pursuits lead him to cross paths with Kevin Wendell Crumb, a sufferer of Dissociative Identity Disorder whose multiple personalities serve as The Horde to his 24th personality known simply as The Beast. After a brief altercation, they both find themselves captured and contained within a mental facility under the supervision of Dr. Ellie Staple (Sarah Paulson), where Dunn's scheming archnemesis Elijah Price (Jackson) also resides.There is a lot to love about Glass. James McAvoy is the definitive standout, and his performance as the tortured Crumb is absolutely fantastic. McAvoy owns the role and his ability to change personalities within mere moments is a true testament to his acting abilities. It's great to see Jackson as the scheming Elijah again, too. Jackson is undoubtably one of the most versatile actors working today, and the damaged mastermind Elijah Price stands as his most underrated role of his entire career. Willis serves perfectly fine as David Dunn, the man whose bones do not break, but is overshadowed slightly by the strengths of both McAvoy and Jackson. M. Night's script explores the psychological aspects of his characters brilliantly as Dr. Staple works to prove that the three of them are merely suffering from 'delusions of grandeur', and that there is a perfectly logical explanation for their supposed 'abilities' that have been lifted from the pages of comic books. Although the film primarily serves as a sequel to Split, the core theme of the film continues on from Unbreakable, exploring the concept of comic book characters existing in our grounded reality. It is the slow burn, psychological aspects that work brilliantly in Glass, and the first two acts of the film show Shyamalan at his very best.What a shame then that the film completely shatters in its third act, where the script completely derails and almost wrecks everything that had been developed during the preceding 90 minutes. In the space of 20 minutes, all intrigue is lost and the plot trips and falls into convoluted territory, souring the story arcs of its three leads. The biggest problem is that M. Night decides to ramp everything up to 11 and screws it up in the process, resulting in a finale that nearly sinks the entire film.In the end, Glass is an enjoyable enough conclusion to the trilogy despite its major third act problems. Unbreakable remains the best of the three films, but Glass is still worth seeing for the strengths of the performances alone. Still, it is a disappointment that the film went out with a whimper rather than a bang.",Glass
350,Eiriksterminator,Unnecessary,5,15 February 2019,"I really liked Unbreakable. It was great in every way. Then, many years later, we got Split, which is both not really a sequel, and also a different genre of movie, but which takes place in the same universe as Unbreakable. That one really wasn't my thing (McAvoy's brilliant acting performance aside). Then finally, we got this movie, which is a proper sequel to both the previous movies, and ties the plot from both of them together into one. This one was much better than Split for me, to be sure, but not even close to Unbreakable, and the ending just left me feeling dejected, not to mention how these sequels were entirely unnecessary in the first place. So, with all of that in mind, I'm personally just going to pretend it all ended with Unbreakable, and that these sequels don't exist. Much better ending to the story that way.",Glass

352,BillSims28,"Bold, Well-acted, Often Entertaining, Messy",7,17 February 2019,"Sometimes, cinema delivers the perfect unexpected trilogy - just ask Richard Linklater, who masterminded the Before series. This surprise conclusion to the Eastrail 177 trilogy, established by the rug-pulling stinger of Split in 2016, may not prove to be a lasting great, but there's certainly a lot to enjoy about it.The fascinating central triumvirate of larger-than-life characters is integral to this: James McAvoy excels once again portraying 20 heterogenous characters, switching effortlessly from the excited lisp of 9 year old 'Hedwig' to the domineering matriarch 'Patricia'. Bruce Willis meanwhile gets the chance to display some of his dramatic acting range, which he has not had much opportunity to do outside of identikit action flicks since 2012's Moonrise Kingdom and Looper. He imbues David Dunn with an feeling of quiet, reliable wisdom and is one of cinema's few great understated superheroes. Samuel L Jackson, implausibly already 70, is a welcome return as comic-obsessed mastermind Elijah Price, whose Machiavellian schemes make for an intriguing superpower. Rounding out the cast is Sarah Paulson, who gives a committed performance, but her character feels underdeveloped and unfortunately less interesting than the fascinating central trio.The biggest draw of Glass is its distinction from other superhero films, which makes it a highly enjoyable experience throughout. It focuses on the smaller scale, finding awe in the most rudimentary of supernatural abilities, with a unique filming style that makes extensive use of CCTV footage and POV perspectives to film fight scenes. This renders the whole experience more personal and realistic, adding to its small-scale feeling (the majority of the film takes place in one building, and there's little to no explosions or infrastructural destruction). It's refreshing to see such restraint in Hollywood, and M Night Shyamalan's personal, mystical style is perfect for it.The main problem with the film is that it attempts the impossible in reconciling the disparate tones of the exquisitely slow-burning deconstruction of the superhero tale in Unbreakable with the taut, horror-tinged paranoia of Split, a psychological thriller. The beginning is all Split, complete with kidnapped children and McAvoy's intense changeability. From there, however, Unbreakable's harsh realities take over, and throughout the remainder of the film there is a constant struggle to unshackle itself from its predecessors, unable to ever fully establish its own tone. It will likely prove too slow for those who only liked Split, and too incoherent for those who only liked UnbreakableIt also suffers from an ending burdened with lumbering twists that feel unearned and in need of some more foreshadowing. This shoves the film straight into the dangerous territory of taking itself far too seriously. Shyamalan is now past the point of inadvertent self-parody with the ridiculous twists he shoehorns into the endings of these films. The promising aspects of this film's ending are thus swiftly lost in over-eager misdirection, drastically reducing its rewatch value.Ultimately, Glass is equal parts fascinating and frustrating, but should not disappoint fans of its precursors. I would be excited to see any future developments in the Eastrail 177 universe, and could imagine a positive response to a more focused feature which affords Shyamalan - or preferably a new, similarly-minded director - the chance to explore supernatural heroism and villainy on the small scale. 68/100.",Glass

354,darrenbjones,An excellent conclusion to the trilogy.,8,27 May 2019,"This film didn't get a lot of love which is unfair but not all that surprising. In a world of Justice League and Avengers Endgame, superhero fans are looking for a special effects extravaganza with cgi fight scenes and epic set pieces.
This was never what this series was about, from Unbreakable, the story of David Dunn, a man reluctantly forced to accept that he has powers and that this gives him responsibilities he doesn't necessarily want by Mr Glass. Then there was Split, the story of Kevin, a man with multiple personalities which conspire to create the Beast, a savage amalgam of his personalities with a grandiose vision of themselves creating a new world order.
The conclusion comes with Glass, a psychological thriller that puts the three protagonists from the series in a hospital where a psychiatrist works to convince them that they are not special, that their 'gifts' can be explained away rationally.
As with all of M. Night Shyamalan's work, there is a twist but even this is multilayered in a conclusion that gives you all the clues to follow, uses all the genre stereotypes that have been established by comic books and then flips this conclusion into a bigger beginning than you expected.
This, like Unbreakable, will benefit from time and reflection. This isn't a popcorn piece and won't appeal to the masses but it isn't supposed to. Bravo.",Glass
355,ty-jensen,Glass isn't bad but it's underwhelming.,5,24 January 2019,"M. Night Shyamalan has wrapped up his Unbreakable trilogy with Glass, a movie that a lot of people weren't expecting. If Unbreakable was a hit, I guess Shyamalan would of made a sequel within five years. Split is loosely a sequel to Unbreakable, it's a standalone movie that nobody knew was connected to Unbreakable till it came out. January is the worst month of the year for movies, Glass was the only movie I was looking forward to although I didn't love Unbreakable. Critics trashed Glass, I think it's fine.19 years has passed since Unbreakable like in real life, David Dunn is still a vigilante. He tracks down Kevin Wendell Crumb and fights him but the police captures them and locks them up in the same mental hospital as Mr. Glass. Have you heard of any other movie where a hero and a villain gets locked up in the same mental hospital or prison?Glass is a grounded superhero movie, it's not like a Marvel film or a DC film, not even close. It's slow paced and dialogue heavy so don't expect a fun, exciting movie. It's a little overlong, a few scenes are drawn and some of the dialogue could of been removed.The acting is great which means Shyamalan isn't a bad director or you could he's hit or miss. Bruce Willis generally phones it in nowadays, he generally makes direct to DVD movies. He gives his best performance since Looper which I own. Sam Jackson is good, maybe some feel he's sleepwalking. James McAvoy steals the show, he shifts personalities many times. Spencer Treat Clark is good, I guess he's better than before. Sarah Paulson is fine, her character is bland.David is sidelined but I knew about it going in, he's barely seen in the second act. Glass is supposed to the main character but he doesn't get enough focus, he isn't in the first act. Kevin is the main focus or he simply has more screen time. The first act focuses on David, the second act focuses on Kevin and the third act focuses on Glass.Shyamalan is known for his twist endings and Glass has a huge twist ending which I think cheesed off some people. I think it's disappointing but I appreciate Shyamalan for taking risks. Yes it came out of left field, there were no hints.Glass isn't a bad movie, it's ambitious but messy.

Nostalgia is rampant, and the film will fall flat (actually, it might anyway) if you don't have the background.I am conflicted with this film. This film follows Dunn (Willis) 19 years after the original Unbreakable. He is not a hero saving those that need saving when he encounters Crumb (McAvoy) the split personality beast from Split. The blend of these two very different movies is odd at worst and creative at best, but the you can't simply past two films together without some seems. Throw in the antagonist from Unbreakable, Glass, (Jackson) and the mess begins.I liken this film to the truism that you can't make an omelette without breaking a few eggs. This falls short of the magnum opus this film should be, but offers a satisfying (if anti climactic) conclusion to this narrative.I find it hard to rate this film individually, and need to look at it as a part III of the franchise.

It's a movie that takes itself seriously. It's the kind of smart movie that confuses critics who prefer light easy-to-digest popcorn entertainment. When it shifts into full thriller or action mode, brace yourself, because it gets totally intense.Director Shyamalan doesn't get much respect from the critics, but screw the critics, he did brilliantly here from writing to directing.And James McAvoy deserves every acting award for 2019. Might as well just give him all of them now, best actor, best actress, best child actor, etc., all of them, because no one's topping this performance.And about the action, I saw director Shyamalan talking in an interview about how he's mainly interested in drama and that action is not his strong point, but he was really downplaying his handling of the action, because the fight scenes here are legitimately awesome. Glass thankfully features none of the shaky rapid-editing style that plagues so many other action movies. It is all well shot, so you'll have no trouble following the action. We even see lots of unusually artistic camera shots during the action, such as showing long close up shots of people's faces while they're in the middle of fighting. My favorite was a long held shot from the point of view of being inside a van while we're seeing a fight happening outside, as the combatants are circling around and slamming into the van. That was just plain cool, the kind of shot that's just mind-boggling to think about how they managed to pull it off.And don't trust the rotten critics. Just don't. They're so worthless, those critics. They're wrong about almost every movie these days. Glass just continues the critics' rotten streak of being totally out of touch with what's really good or bad.",Glass
364,coastdaze,Glass - really the end??,8,1 March 2019,"What a nice way to tie things up! I've watched the characters Dunn (Bruce Willis), Crumb (James McAvoy) & Glass )Sam L. Jackson) in M. Night's previous movies with enthusiasm and this movie comes through in spades. I would have liked a bit more story development is my only complaint, it seemed to move too fast. Nonetheless, I liked bringing the 3 together and the twists the storyline takes. And what can one say about James McAvoy!? What an utterly believable portrayal of his crazy Crumb character. Wow, he's good the way he changes personalities so seamlessly. Again I say that I like movies that entertain without having to use and overabundance of foul language, grossness or sex. If you've seen the other movies with these characters, you'll better understand some of the points the movie makes. And I love that they brought back the actor who played Dunn's little son to portray his grown up son.",Glass
365,impendingdd,Why is Shyamalan such a loser?,1,24 March 2020,"After a long losing streak, Shymalan surprised everyone with Split. A horror turning out to be a sequel to a 16 year older super hero drama literally no one saw coming. Genius, indeed. But then I guess Shymalan missed the feeling of being a massive disappointment because he went back to making dog doo. This movie had so much potential. Three of the greatest actors in history and a brilliant set up and he completely failed. This movie sucked. Endings to trilogy's face the most criticism because they're responsible for their predecessors and here Shymalan has made a film not even worthy of standing on its own.

366,ranblackman,I don't know about this one.,7,16 May 2019,"This movie has me very confused. I want to say I like it, I want to say it was well made, I will say that I loved the acting from the three leads, I will say I love the score. This means I can add that the characterizations were very damn good, it made the film interesting. However, I cannot escape the problems in writing. I cannot escape saying that Shyamalan erred in his directing in parts, shots coming off as too showy. The dialogue too, the unsubtle reserves to comic books. It is really hammered in. We get this movie, like Unbreakable able, is a gritty, realistic portrayal of comic books, its the appeal of that first movie and of this sequel. We do not need to have this shoved down our throat. We also get that strange, inhuman way of talking Shyamalan has plagued so many of his movies with, though it is not all around or as bad.The acting does come in though, does save it a great deal. Willis, Jackson, and especially Macavoy are all great here. It's a real treat to finally see Willis out effort into a role and actually, give a damn again. Jackson is as charismatic as always. However, the real talent here is James Macavoy. He is incredible. Much as he was in Split. He moves in and out of all the different persons inside kwc, morphs his face, subtly changes his body language, it is downright scary. The idea of these three characters coming to a head, the best, the hero, and the villain are what made this movie confusing movie better. That and the ending, which really tied things off nicely.",Glass
367,shadow_blade-89459,Just Ok,7,12 April 2019,"""Glass"" (2019) is a professionally produced Sci-Fi drama that continues the story of Kevin Wendell Crumb, played by James McAvoy, of ""Split"" (2016) and David Dunn, played by Bruce Willis, of ""Unbreakable"" (2000) leading up to and their capture and placement into the Raven Hill Memorial Psychiatric Hospital where Elijah Price, known as Mr. Glass, played by Samuel L. Jackson, has been captive for almost two decades. Throughout their stay within the medical facility and the major condition for their release, Dr. Ellie Staple, played by Sarah Paulsen, is charged with convincing them that they do not possess any special ""powers"" which they have to accept or undergo medical procedure. I can honestly say that I was truly looking forward to this film, having seen both ""Unbreakable"" and ""Split,"" but feel that the story was mostly a misfire. In true M. Night Shyamalan style, I enjoyed the twists, even if a few were forecast, but it felt forced. I liked the film, but do not love it as I do the previous two.The acting in this film is more hit than miss, but I must tip my hat once again to James McAvoy. His portrayal of characters that he had to switch through seamlessly is just uncanny, especially with the additional characters. I can appreciate the blandness of the medical facility, but I truly believe something was missing. It may have been the storytelling being overly repetitive between trying to reestablish the connection of the previous films to this one or the lack of true visual push, but I really feel this film could have been better. I would have focused more on the current story and less on the reconnect because majority of the viewers of this film have seen one or both previous. Overall, it's a decent film that I would, with precaution, recommend to anyone who haven't seen the previous films.",Glass

How the child-like masses wanted it to end: nobody dies, or if they die, there is some kind of time travel invoked that brings them back, or at least linger the possibility that they are not really dead and may come back in a series of 8 sequels yet to come.Mr. Shyamalan had the guts to go the former route, and is suffering the slings and arrows of the masses as a result, but I think that he achieved something quite rare. Not only is Glass a successful film, but he made a series of three films (Unbreakable, Split, Glass) that are greater together than the sum of their parts. Films that leave you guessing about what happens off-screen in that world, rather than filling in all the blanks with eye-popping explosions and laser beams.I just hopes he leaves it here, and moves on to other projects.",Glass
370,botrytis,"When being low budget is forced, not necessary.",4,6 April 2019,"The first real issue about this whole movie that it wants to be a part of something bigger, and that this whole ""franchise"" wants to be a franchise just out of the blue somehow.Unbreakable was a masterpiece, till today it is on my list of all time favorite movies, and it's on the par with the Dark Knight (2008) in the conext of best hero movies that are set in the real world with realistic elements.The movie Split was a good thriller, and mostly an excuse to make a Shyamalan-like, but cheap plot twist at the end of the movie; The twist that it was an ""Unbreakable"" movie, and everyone had to have their mind blown by it. I liked it though.Mr. Glass is just a really minimalisticly done Unbreakable-like movie that really tries to be a part of the previous duo, really wants to fit in, but the end result is just overall laughably bad, because all three movies are puzzle pieces from different boxes each, and probably this ""Glass"" puzzle piece is the most unfiting one. It is so cheap compared to the whole Shyamalan name that it's just painful to see how below average the expectation the whole crew had for a movie, that's a third instalment, a finale, a conclusion for something like the Unbreakable itself. There is literally a moment in the movie where the character pulls the villain - that wants to go to the huge city - back to the minimalistic, hospital environment. That scene was like it was saying; ""HEY, come back to the low budget quality, don't even imagine to go there!"".(Spoilers) But, to be honest, it wouldn't be an issue for me if it was a low budget, small production movie if it was well done, or well written, but obviously, I am writing here because this movie mostly fails to be a hero movie. Or it is an antagonist movie? I am not sure really, because the whole ending somehow wants to tell you that Mr. Glass, even if a massmurdering psychopat, he did created heroes, and somehow we should simphatise with him because his mother, who actually still supported him, was a part of the team where David Dunn's son and the girl from Split were. Because.... I don't know, they don't have to fill that plothole, why should they?(Spoilers) Oh and what the hell was that whole anti-hero cult about? The whole motivation of their existence is laughable. Really weak. What's also weak, is that all three ""protagonists"" had to die... because... that would make sense... for... being dramatic... or tragic... but... didn't work, because the whole concept behind this movie is close to being idiotic.(Spoilers) What bugged me the most; the lack of detailed psychological analization or explanation towards the three protagonist from Ellie. She insisted, that the first marvelous event for David was the train accident, even though everyone knew, even the papers that back in High School days, David Dunn and his not yet wife had a car accident, and nothing happened to him there either. Yet David somehow was convinced that he is not that special because she brought up the train accident being a cause of somekind of braindamage. So, if this anti-hero cult is really that thorough, shouldn't they suppose to know about David a little bit more? And shouldn't David suppose to be a little more selfconfidence after years of heroism and vigilanty acts? Years of knowing that he is UNBREAKABLE? Great writing. Really, well done.When he had the vision about Ellie, where they sit in the restaurant... yeah, people, that's how bad people are, that's how they act! Seriously, what the hell was that...Oh right. ""First name Mr., Last name Glass""... that's a quote from Mr. Glass himself... What a tedious introduction, huh? This sentence was SO GOOD presumably for Mr. Shyam, that when ""Glass"" cut the throat of that assistent with broken GLASS, they cut back to this sentence... ""First name Mr., Last name Glass"" ... pffffft.... burst out of laugh. Did Shyamalan really thought that would work well? I hope not, and I hope he deliberately does icky scenes like this.Should we feel bad about the Split guy, because his father died and had a bad childhood, and is a psycho? Should we feel bad for Mr. Glass because he had a bad, unpleasant life and is a psycho mass murderer? Well... I do feel sorry for Kevin though... but not for ""Mr. I gonna find the heroes by kill bunch of people, and you should be glad for that people!""I don't want to be rude, but Shyamalan is just an exotic narcististic excrement that is not even talented anymore. At least he was at places back in the days, but he is close to becoming a ""Little better Edition of Uwe Boll""... and to be honest I wasn't even exaggerating there at all.A probably Okay hero movie, but a terrible Unbreakable movie.",Glass

It was a lot of fun to catch up with David and his son so long after Unbreakable and to see James McAvoy revel in his greatest roll again.
Jackson is subtle and cool, giving his best performance since Django. Sarah Paulson as always is just a show-stealer who seems to make really good decisions when choosing movies and TV shows to star.
After a string of 'not so hot movies'. M. Night Shyamalan has redeemed himself with Split and Glass.",Glass
373,MovieBinger,Title: Mcavoy,4,9 May 2019,James McAvoy carries this film on his back. Purely Oscar performance. The end of the film was a huge letdown the way the characters went. Other than that the story was a bit slow and not enough of action with the main characters. Bruce and Sam were good when they were on screen but didn't have enough screen time to stand out.The way the story goes they tried to expand on the universe but nothing will come of that the way they hope when ending the characters like what happened.,Glass
374,actaction,"3rd Act disappoints, weaker than its formers...",6,18 January 2019,"While the concept of ""real superheros"" feels as fresh today as it did when Unbreakable did it back in 2000, Glass feels like the ultimate hold-back by a writer who has made a career out of making you wonder. Perhaps, the filmmaker that was the king of endings that attempted to satisfy, often surprise (sometimes overstating the point), has finally found a way to write a story that increasingly gets bolder, but refrains from actually being what it says it is... thus always pushing the satisfaction of an ending off until later, if ever. I wonder how many episodes of LOST it took him watching to learn how to slowly allot out his story twists? It feels much the same.Glass isn't a bad film and the ideas and characters hold up for what little they're tested, but because we were led into this by better structured and moodier previous entries, mild & understated Unbreakable & indie overachiever Split, we know and expected part three to be much more & it could have been much better. The film is worth seeing if you have already been invested, but on its own falls down under the pressure of its own promise in the third act.Characters are standing around, seemingly lost, as we go through the motions of a police/villain battle that is destined to go nowhere and for which we get nothing added in our understanding of the character's ability or state-of-mind. The ending, like unbreakable, feels tacked on, as if the filmmaker is promising next time we'll see what's actually happening. I don't mind a cliffhanger or even a surprise ending, but wish we could have had more going on NOW, instead of all being pushed for later or told in flashbacks that should have been shown earlier. In the now, Dunn (Bruce Willis) just kind of stands stoically not sure how to express himself... and what would he say if he did? Nobody knows. He hasn't grown since Unbreakable. Even the scene stealing Macavoy, is doing a version of himself, the character he invented and brought to better and more entertaining life in Split. The character Glass (Sam L Jackson) has the most character growth, but feels like it could have been done with one extra scene after Unbreakable, not deserving of an entire film. I was hoping for more. By now, it should have went to the next step. I long for the day of less promises and more delivered. It's the weakest of the series thus far.",Glass
375,Chance_Boudreaux19,Interesting,7,18 January 2019,"I feel like everyone will like and dislike different things about this movie. Many are complaining about the slow second act but that is the part I enjoyed a lot. The first act was also great. I liked the psychological elements of the movie and the long conversations that questioned the superhuman abilities of the characters to a point when I started questioning them myself. The third act was what bought down the movie a notch for me. Especially the revelation of the syndicate which controls the existence of superheros around the world. The last scene was also very disappointing and felt a bit tacked on for me with a setup for a sequel which I don't think should happen. I would have much preferred if the movie ended in a fight between David Dunn and the Beast without any twists, just nice and simple in a way that would've wrapped up the trilogy with a neat little bow. Finally, I don't like how Bruce Willis is greatly underused in this movie and his fate is quite disappointing. Unbreakable was mainly a movie about his character and yet a sequel uses him the least out of the 3 main characters, or at least it felt like that. Overall though it's a very interesting, original movie which I enjoyed a lot despite some of my criticism and I feel that the critics are chastising it too much as it's much better than most run-of-the-mill sequels, prequels or spin-offs that come out these days.",Glass
376,Her-Excellency,I admit it. I cried.,10,3 April 2019,"At about fifteen minutes in, I was ready to walk out. It felt so unlike the other two installments. Bruce Willis looked ancient, I thought it would be more of McAvoy reenacting his previous role in this franchise, and Samuel Jackson, well, I've seen a hundred times be Samuel Jackson ...But then something marvelous happened.It grew on me in ways I wasn't expecting. I actually began to feel for each of the characters and in some remote part of my brain, this was REAL. I can't say how those involved in this film managed to do that beyond what other movies have been able to, but they did. To say that I became immersed in it, is an understatement. Were there moments of 'cheese'? Absolutely. But they were more like Brie than cheap cheese, and they were enveloped well by non-cheesiness goodness. Willis's age went from detractor to heart-wrenching. McAvoy's acting was (pardon my redundancy) superbly top-notch and impeccably perfect. Even Samuel Jackson managed to make me believe that this is one role he was actually invested in.And at the end - I cried.
...And I don't normally cry.In as far as the ongoing debate about the ending, I can see all the sides and where everyone is coming from. The ending is not one I would have opted for, but I see everything Shyamalan wanted to say and can only imagine how difficult it was to get it all in, and perhaps this was the only way to do so. In retrospect, the ending I would have wanted would not have been as powerful.Loved it.",Glass

This is only speculation from my side, but i honestly don't believe MNS had the idea of making a trilogy to begin with. It was an idea that popped up later.
There is absolutely nothing new or interesting in this tale and the classic twist is as boring and unsurprising as they come.

386,thirtyfivestories,"Shyamalan Screams, ""Remember My Hits?""",2,19 January 2019,"Remember when Unbreakable stood as a defensible film in the Shyamalan canon? Well M. Night seems set on sullying even his stand alone convention-defying superhero movie of 2000. In true ""this is why we can't have good things"" fashion, Shyamalan shoehorned his last film Spilt, a deeply problematic portrayal of Dissociative Identity Disorder, into the universe of Unbreakable, and we all collectively sighed knowing he was going spend his next movie justifying the mess he created by pointing back to his glory days. Imagine a dad at a barbeque boasting about his time as an All-American wide receiver, but another dad questions his credentials so the former athlete yanks a pigskin from his son's hands, instructing his critic to throw him a slant route. Now feel the anguish of this old timer tripping over his legs, bringing the good times to a halt with a trip to the ER. Glass is that catastrophic trip, and we are the mortified son.I suppose I am required to summarize the endless chain of asinine plot conveniences that is the narrative of the film. I will do so, but not gladly. Bruce Willis slumps into his opening frames (and I mean slumps, possibly the most half-assed character reprisal ever) as David Dunn, the vigilante of Unbreakable now with his son Joseph operating as his dispatcher/Alfred. Joseph is also a reprisal role for the then child actor Spencer Treat Clark, and if 19 years did anything it was to steal away any ounce of chemistry from the father-son pair. David has made a nasty little habit out of bruising up petty criminals, but his son encourages a grander target: the multiple personality kidnapper and primary subject of Split.In comes the infinitely transformable James McAvoy, whose scenes are shot with far less ambition and exposing editing which doesn't retain the magic of his last outing as ""The Beast"". More accurately he shifts through numerous identities which step in and out of ""the light"", and whose ultimate manifestation is a vein-popping, wall-scaling animal possessing strength only equaled by David. After a series of contrived plot beats, we're given an early showdown between the two that apparently was a big, elaborate mouse trap? Honestly your guess is as good as mine, seeing as there's no way to justify letting four girls be imprisoned by a murderer for the sake of luring in a man whose number you clearly have. I'm speaking to the mysterious agency that seems to collect supernatural individuals in hopes of convincing them they are ordinary.Now if I lost you with that last paragraph; the film did the same to me. Sarah Paulson does her best to make sense of this logical idiom as she plays Dr. Staple, a psychiatrist whose field is ""superhero debunking"" (note I'm simplifying Shyamalan's arduously clunky title). She is tasked by an unknown agency to prove these two superhumans of their ""delusions of grandeur"". Add in an unexplained appearance of Mr. Glass (Samuel L. Jackson) from the Unbreakable film, and you have yourself a trio. Although this movie bears his title, Jackson sits sedated like a vegetable for a unhealthy chunk of the runtime in order to pull one of a crowded few Shyamalan twists in the third act.The greatest annoyance here is Shyamalan's overt reliance on the visual motifs of his previously successful films. Fights in the rain, jumping out of high windows, and close ups of characters that have been duped are all present here. He recreates with zero creativity and prays that nostalgia wows reptilian-brained viewers. Add a meta narrative on par with Lady in the Water that creeps up to tell you why he has created a superior superhero franchise, and my fury is damn well justified. This is not acceptable, and is more manipulative than the comic book movies he is trying to bash.I have no doubts that this will land on an audience that has been starving for a further installment in their most beloved genre-bending movies that was Unbreakable. But I would ask them to look into Willis' eyes here. Peer into the emptiness and convince me that he thought this was a good idea. Lars von Trier did a power move by critiquing all his films with original footage vignettes plopped into the middle of last year's The House the Jack Built. That was bold and effective, if not masturbatory. Shyamalan's pillaging of his previous movies is nauseating and pathetic, but with no vile nature. You just feel sad for the guy after your anger subsides.",Glass
387,NpMoviez,Almost what I wanted it to be but not exactly how I wanted it to conclude.,6,19 April 2019,"I am extremely happy that the Eastrail trilogy exists, but I extremely sad about how it chose to go off. I will recommend it, but man, I feel so mixed about it.Good : Shyamalan gives us a potentially great movie with some unforgivable flaws. The setting and the concept looks really incredible. Bruce Willis looked really good after a very long time. He cared for his role and was great as David Dunn. Naturally, James McAvoy gives an incredible performance as Kevin and the other personalities. Samuel Jackson kills it as Mr. Glass yet again. He is not in a role that we usually see him in, and he hasn't lost the touch in perhaps the most ""against type"" role he has ever done. The first act and how all the three lead characters are brought together is quite good. There are emotional scenes and deaths. All of them hit the perfect note for me. I was almost crying in those scenes. There were some characters I never wanted to see dying, but they do. I would've never minded if they were unrealistically resurrected, but they aren't. It's not a spoiler at all. It made me realize how well Shyamalan wrote and directed those characters and how amazing the respective performances were, and how much I liked each of them. Also, I loved how Shyamalan used some of the deleted scenes from Unbreakable in this movie.Mixed : We got to see a lot of Kevin's identities than in Split, but I think the less was more in this case. McAvoy did a great job, but many parts felt as a forced spot for some random character to pop out. Anya Taylor-Joy gives a great performance, but we don't buy what she does due to a poorer writing and underdeveloped emotional weights. She does her job very well to elevate the material, and I loved what she did. But in the end, it wasn't so believable. Honestly, I don't think she was needed in the film. And finally I admire Shyamalan's guts to send off the main characters in the way he did. But, the way they went off didn't do a proper justice to them. The same thing could've been done in a much better way.Bad : The most frustrating part would be the arc given to David Dunn. It was the most poorly done part of the movie. In particular, the way they sent him off was the most frustrating part of the movie. I can accept the way how the others were sent off, but not him. He deserved a lot better than this. It felt as if Shyamalan wanted to do it properly, but couldn't because of the budget or studio interference. And the last two twists. The first one was something I have seen in some horror films, and I have started to feel that such an interpretation is the most blant thing to do. The second twist involves Mr. Glass. The twist gives a feel good moment, but since it involves Mr. Glass, the terrorist who killed a lot of people, it didn't feel right in the direction they went. Lastly, there are some plot hole type of stuff there. The way they decided to control Kevin's personalities could've been avoided if he would cover his eyes. The way they use water as a ""kryptonite"" for Dunn was stupid and totally different from the one done in Unbreakable. Mr. Glass' plan seem to work perfectly, but it feels as if he knew how every single thing would turn out in the end, which is impossible. Also, there are some comic book panels which show the exact stuff that happen in Split, and makes a little to no sense. There are shots which tend to establish a link between Casey and Dunn, but I don't know how that worked.Conclusion : Only I know how much I wanted to give it an absolute 10/10 and an A+. Sadly, I cannot do it. I read somewhere that it was supposed to be a 3.5 hour long movie. I am really eager to watch the Director's cut. It doesn't feel like the exact movie Shyamalan planned to do. It feels like a really great movie trimmed down. Not choppy editing. I feel as if the ideas that were in this movie were not completely explored. As a Shyamalan movie, it is in my top 5. It's way better than some other films he gave us, earlier this decade. But still, Sixth Sense and Unbreakable remain the ultimate greats he has given.Rating.Score : 6.7/10Grade : B+(Only I know how bad I am feeling to assign these ratings to this movie)",Glass

390,LongTimeMovieLover,Let Down,6,19 January 2019,"Unbreakable was great, Split was good, this was maybe okay. The clearest indication of the standard for this movie was M. Night's clearly indulgent cameo, which simply intruded. If care for the movie was the highest concern, M. Night would not have entered in such an indulgent and interruptive cameo. This was a paycheck for Willis and Jackson, and an indulgence for M. Night. The purists may like it for whatever subtlety only the purist perceive. I'm maybe an enthusiast, so, for me, not good.",Glass
391,SweetWilliam63,A Pass On 'Glass',6,2 May 2019,"Of Shyamalan's trilogy ('Unbreakable' in 2000 and 'Split' in 2018) this is the least smart or enjoyable. McAvoy's character is not so much sinister as comical (admittedly sometimes purposely) and Willis and Jackson are given little to do. 'Glass' is a more distilled analysis of the exceptional aspects of madness and it's interpretation. In this way 'Glass ' is the deus ex machina of the trilogy. If that sounds more like a 'Ted Talk' then a movie, you'd be right. Shyamalan has made a career out of weaving the supernatural with the mundane and, of his seventeen films, atleast eight have relied on twist endings. The best of these have provided clues throughout the movie that allow an audience to enjoy the movie from two different perspectives (with the innocent frame of mind or without) but it's also turned the genre into a trope that can fall flat or relies too much on the illogical (see Jordan Peele's 'Us' for an example). However, this won't stop fans of the first two films from seeing 'Glass'. ""Are they or aren't they""? By the end you won't care either way.",Glass

393,webwizardbe,Really boring movie & nerve-racking,2,3 April 2019,"I still like the first movie with Bruce Willis, and I hoped he finally got a good part again in a decent movie after all the years he spent in B-movies.
But after an hour of psycho-analysis and treatment of the 3 superhero's I had it.
People here are talking oscar for James McAvoy, why? For being annoying as hell? His acting was mediocre and not compelling enough for this sort of character.
And the other two, we're they even making an effort.
A movie with that actress of American Horror Story, the fallen Bruce Willis and oh yeah, Samuel L. Jackson he was there too. I should have known better. Money wasted, time wasted and a bad mood afterwards. My advice: don't waste your time on this, even if they offer it for free.",Glass
394,Rainbowbeany,It won't turn out the way you think.,7,13 February 2019,"I liked this movie for the chances it took with the plot. I just wished the movie knew how to balance the three leads. The beginning of the movie starts out amazing well. Very face paced and the action is pretty awesome. Then they literally throw the breaks on to a snails pace for a bit. This is where then bad juggling happens. Sarah Paulson elevates this part with the help of James McAvoy. The problems lies when Samuel Jackson comes out of his first act coma basically pushing Bruce Willis to the background. The third act picks up with multiple twists. Some land some don't. But they take some wild chances, twists and turns with the plot that might make some people angry. But I enjoyed those elements. A good closing chapter to this trilogy that actually closes the book. Some franchises should take more chances like this.",Glass

Nothing happens in all the movie (although that's not bad), it's really slow, it cooks slowly and it's the best part (unless we are thinking that), but suddenly everything goes to hell in the final act when it started to go up level, TERRIBLE, suddenly a sect appears that wants to destroy superhumans, it doesn't matter if you're good or bad (every good part is in the trailers and clips). The only thing that raises the film is James McAvoy's performance. Don't go to watch this, don't waste your money and time.

399,lhbaker-28783,This is my fifth favorite movie ever out of the 168+ movies I've watched! Here's why.,10,15 October 2021,"Ok first off I want to say that Chiller7 (one of the people who wrote a review on Glass) wrote everything I would have wrote. And he is absolutely right with everything he wrote. So I guess I have to write something different.Firstly I think the main thing people didn't like was the ending. I thought it was a spectacular ending. I understand why people didn't like it, because it was a touch confusing, but I'll go as far to say that it is nearly as good as The Sixth Sense and The Prestige's endings, although very different.Secondly Glass has amazing suspense / thriller / mystery / horror. I think this category probably did better than Split did (although not horror). Glass definitely has better and amazing action than any of his other movies. It's action scenes are wonderful, and something that is new for M. Night Shyamalan. Glass definitely has amazing emotion better than it's two prequels. It has emotion for each character, but my favorite is from Keven/Split character.Next, something that M. Night Shyamalan and his camera crew do special is camera angles. They definitely do that here, especially in the action scenes.Then I want to say the acting is spectacular. Every character plays wonderfully. Especially the one who plays Kevin's character. How he can perform his different personalities even decent is amazing, but he goes way beyond decent.Lastly I want to say that I did consider this to be better than Split when I watched this. Never did I consider it to have a chance to be better than Old. And definitely I could not think it could almost be as good as The Sixth Sense. But it achieved all these things nonetheless.If you made it this far congratulations, I wouldn't have made it through all that reading. But it is all necessary. Everything thing I said should be considered facts not option. Anyways I'm going to end this review by saying, GO WATCH GLASS!",Glass

His part was equaled by his physical appearance, beastly movement and superb effects.Samual Jackson felt more absent. Sarah Paulson was worthy mostly and Bruce Willis was fine playing Bruce.The story was there, there were moments of excitement, but overall it left me a bit cold.

408,imdb2-5,Excellent performances marred by huge logic gaps and WTF ending,4,20 January 2019,"This film has top actors who give great performances that lend credence to a simplistic comic book plot which features very large logic gaps and a WTF ending. As they say, no one every goes full Shyamalan - except for Shyamalan.It takes the story line from earlier films such as Unbreakable and combining it with Split, with the premise that a doctor believes that her three patients suffer from delusions of possessing super powers which don't really exist. But as we know, one does possess superior strength and the other is a schizophrenic who also has superhuman strength when that character is activated. One can suspend belief for only so long until silliness and B-movie signs creep into the film. For example, why would you leave one powerful psychopath unshackled, even if you think he can be controlled in an ostensibly casual manner?Still, even in its ridiculousness and far too much verbal interchange, the actors play their parts so well that you can put aside the obvious holes in the film, strange wooden nature of the doctor, and Shyamalan's typical placement of himself (as in all his films) to obvious poor but limited effect. We are about 2/3 through the film when it goes full Shyamalan. The ending is implausible, even with the characters themselves. And the final scene is downright bend over and laugh hysterical. Is this an attempt at a sequel trilogy or the final thud to this series? I don't know.",Glass
409,TheConnoisseurReviews,A Satisfying Conclusion to a franchise 20 years in the making,9,30 January 2019,"""Glass,"" directed by M. Night Shyamalan is a film almost 20 years in the making. Ever since watching ""Unbreakable,"" I wanted a sequel and expansion to the universe that was set up, but sadly it did not come to fruition. Then, seamlessly out of nowhere, ""Split"" comes out nearly 17 years later and ignites my hopes again and then this movie was announced months later. So, does it live up to the anticipation?In short, yes. Yes it does live up to the near 20 year wait and it is one heck of a movie. What ""Glass"" does so well is expand the universe and brings this amazing set of cult classics to a satisfying and unexpected conclusion. It's a film that finds a sweet spot between the brooding and meticulous pace of ""Unbreakable"" and the more swift and haunting progression of ""Split,"" while also having its own level of energy and intrigue.Shyamalan put a lot of love and care into this film. It's one of his most sympathetic films and I commend him for the direction he takes it. He's so sure of what he wants and he delivers just what he promises. His use of music and camera framing delivers on the emotions that he wants you to feel. It portrays the action and mystery and keeps you invested the whole time. It's layered with a good amount of humor and heart. There are some silly moments and some parts that aren't explained very well, but in the grand scheme of things, they're almost inconsequential. They don't take away from the finale, but make you scratch your head a little.The best part of the film, aside from the music and action, are the the actors. Bruce Willis actually gives a hoot and it's great seeing how far his character has come since the first film. Mr. Glass, a.k.a Samuel L. Jackson, brings the same level of menace and pretentiousness that he had before albeit there are a couple questionable moments and revelations with him. Sarah Paulson is great and brings a dynamic that felt natural and a welcome inclusion. She plays off of the other 3 characters incredibly well. Anya Taylor-Joy and the rest of the supporting cast from ""Unbreakable"" are in here and are really great and integral to the plot, even though they're not in it as much as I would like. However, the star and the real spectacle of the film is James McAvoy as ""The Horde"" or Kevin Wendell Crumb. He's fantastic and changes between 24 personas with such easy, it's almost unreal. He deserves all the recognition he can get. It's just a stunning performance that I think not even the best in the business could pull off.""Glass"" is a great movie. However, it is a movie that I can see not resonating with a lot of people. The ending is a bit daunting, but if you go with the flow, you'll have a blast. Also, if you're unfamiliar with ""Unbreakable"" and ""Split"" it can be hard to get into, so I highly recommend watching those two other great movies. It is definitely a movie for the fans of his franchise. There are so many throwbacks and references that actually had me giddy with excitement.Overall, ""Glass"" is a great movie that honors comic books and superheroes, but also promotes compassion, sympathy and respect. It is a satisfying conclusion to a near 2 decade films series in the making that delivers on everything promised. It's filled with action, humor, mystery, and heart. I give it 4.5/5",Glass
410,BestBenedikt,Another frustrating Shyamalan-experience,3,5 April 2019,"After the inventive piece of cinema that was UNBREAKABLE and the very mediocre SPLIT we now have a more than clunky conclusion to Shyamalan's superhero trilogy that in a whole feels like its idea was shoehorned into SPLIT during the post production process.The whole narrative of GLASS is extremely inconsistent and doesn't make a whole lot of sense once you think about it for five minutes. Shyamalan's twists at the end naturally don't change that for the better and rather provide plot holes galore. The story isn't the only thing suffering as a result though, since all of the character arcs (especially David Dunn's) turn out to be disappointingly shallow. Having said that, the misfire that GLASS was really didn't anger me as much as I thought it would - it rather made for a particular boring watch.I don't understand why some people are making this film out to be some cinematic stroke of genious. In retrospect, Shyamalan really just was a two-hit wonder with THE SIXTH SENSE and UNBREAKABLE. GLASS unfortunately joins the long line of frustrating Shyamalan-experiences we keep ketting ever since.",Glass
411,bogdanbalostin,Perfection,10,21 April 2019,"I'm not saying this is the best story in a movie, but as a whole, the movie is perfect. Remove one element and we get a flawed movie. The whole direction changes.I was not a fan of the sound effect during the beginning, which makes any mundane activity really creepy but then I realize without exactly these sounds, the movie is not the same. Remove one of the actors and the movie fails. Remove the dark realistic ending (also, smart) and the movie is not the same.There are clues all over the movie and the performance is mesmerizing. Full of dialogue with psychological twists, I was never bored. The action the same, is visceral and real (I don't know how to call when I felt every punch).And the best part, this story only works in a movie format. Because there is more than a story here. I'm not a movie expert by any means but the way some scenes are filmed, if they weren't filmed like this, they would be boring and not relevant.This is what you get when you combine a clever story with the right actors, keep special effects real and add a fitting soundtrack with the right usage of silence.Is this a superhero movie? I doubt it. More like an anti-superhero movie.",Glass
412,donovandesign,One of the most poorly directed and ill-scripted films I have ever seen!,1,20 October 2019,"When M. Night Shyamalan does it bad, he does it impossibly and inconceivably bad!I went into the film expecting to enjoy it, as I did the first and second installments of the trilogy. But as the tedious plot wore on, the movie gloated with the cringe-worthy acting jobs of both McAvoy and Paulson. These two fine actors were rudderless thanks to Shyamalan and Willis was virtually asleep during the entire film.It became crystal clear to me that this movie was going to exceed even my worst expectations. And exceed it did- on every cinematic level imaginable.This wasn't a film as much as it was a creative train wreck and a conscious effort on the part of the writers and director to see just how devoted a fan base could be- How much the audience could indeed tolerate. Each convoluted scene failed to deliver in every artistic way. It was truly appalling.One small nugget of the horrendous directing was the dreary hand combat between McAvoy and Willis, strangling each other in a first person, circular dance with their hands on each others' throats.. (Just like the dance scene created for Travolta and Gorney during ""More than a woman"" in Saturday Night Fever, that have become such a joke meme in movies ever since.)It as all so poorly and ineffectively shot that it was actually comic. And just how did this ""superman"" character of Willis finally meet his end? Un-heroically with a single street cop holding Willis' face down in a puddle of water. Where was all his fantastic super strength? He couldn't simply lift his head up to keep from drowning in an inch of water??? There was just so much of this implausible nonsense that I can't being to detail all of it.It's inconceivable to me how anyone could rate this film with more than One Star. As I read the glowing 9 and 10 star reviews, I can't help but wonder if we were all watching the same film.Finally, the ""moral"" of this slipshod piece of cinematic garbage was (now wait for it...) we can ALL be superheroes if we are simply allowed to believe it. Seriously! That was the moral.Friends...It's a bona fide dog of a movie, which is a damn shame because ""Signs"" , ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""The Village"" were fine and unique films.",Glass

414,clh-1,Everything but the Ending,6,12 February 2021,"Following up on two outstanding films, Glass had a lot to live up to. And it mostly succeeds. The overall story is interesting, and in keeping with the ""real world superhero"" nature of the series, it helps to ground the action inside the realm of human possibility. And that makes the film work, mostly.
The main three cast members are at the very top of their games; Bruce Willis gives an understated but enjoyable performance. James McAvoy gives another award-worthy turn, just like in Split. And Samuel L. Jackson is clearly having a lot of fun with role.
The story itself is interesting in how it examines the realities of the characters; are they something more than normal, or is it simply a delusion or mental illness? Bruce Willis's David Dunn seems willing to accept the latter and eventually move on with his life. But Jackson's Elijah and McAvoy's Kevin Crumb are not as sure. Taken at this point, the film would be an excellent mediation on the natures of good and evil in the popular consciousness and about the power of self-determination.
But the film falls short in writer-director Shyamalan going for one of his trademark twists. The reveal that those who have apparently been the authorities have all this time been a secret cabal with the intent of keeping those with superhuman abilities from the world in some vague notion of maintaining a balance of power in humanity.
A superhero film doesn't have to have a happy ending, but when it's clearly a bleak twist simply for the sake of a bleak twist, it wrecks what had otherwise been an intense and interesting build up. The ""twist"" of Unbreakable was built carefully and methodically, with clues along the way and it felt natural. The reveal in Split doesn't take away from the story. But here, it just takes the entire series off the rails.
I really wanted to love this movie. Going in the previous films in the series had built a lot of goodwill. And while there are some great parts here, it ultimately comes up a little short.",Glass

I just liked what he did with the others more.Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Willis seemed wasted to be honest although, in the case of the latter, this probably helped the film because Bruce stopped caring about giving his best a long time ago.

Watching Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson, and James McAvoy play off each other is fun to watch. It's too bad that Willis is given the least screentime. McAvoy is especially a treat to watch as the supernatural serial killer Kevin Wendell Crumb aka the Horde/Beast.Shyamalan's directing style is still unique in this age of interchangeable summer fare. His insistence on long shots and dialogue heavy scenes is admirable.However once again, he cannot resist to avoid indulging in his pretentious self righteous streak. Most of this occurs in the messy and obnoxiously pseudointellectual third act. There's a series of reveals and shocking developments that defy what you would normally expect for a superhero film.

There simply is not enough evidence to suggest they would be picked out to join this trio.We as spectators know .. but the people ""in the world"" would not. You do not ""see"" superior intellect. You do not ""see"" someone that is unbreakable. Sure there would be doctors and reports about some irregularities - but NOTHING to suggest such actions being taken.Apart from this (and the unrealistic amount of measures taken against each of those .. ) the idea is that we want to prove that they are not super-human.Alright .. but that falls flat, when the entire location is decked out in anti-super-human-measures.The motivations of the doctor are weak, too. Plot-holes in movies are a common thing .. and often unavoidable. But when they are too big .. the whole structure falls apart.
The doctor acts so unprofessional (like confirmation bias) that it totally breaks immersion. And that is very sad for a movie like that.All in all .. sadly an underwhelming movie .. but with good acting indeed. Its the writing that fails it big time",Glass

Night Shyamalan returns for the third, and presumably final, film in his superhuman trilogy that began with Unbreakable, then continued (sort of) with Split. Those films' stars, James Macavoy, Bruce WIllis, Samuel L. Jackson, and Anya Taylor-Joy return along with Spencer Treat Clarke as Willis's son and Charlayne Woodard as Jackson's mother.As implied at the end of Split, this movie opens with Willis's character David Dunn, along with his son acting as his techie sidekick, are hunting the Horde, Macavoy's multiple personality monster. Both actors slide into their signature roles with great ease and the only thing more fun than watching Macavoy's uncanny ability to swap personas mid-sentence is watching Bruce Willis, who has famously sort of stopped caring, and stopped trying, when it comes to his film roles. But his old collaborator Night managed to wake him up and for the first time in a long time, he is giving 100% effort. And I liked last year's Death Wish but even then, he seemed to be firing on roughly 80% of his ability.I absolutely enjoyed the first third of this movie. It's exactly the sequel to Unbreakable we all wanted and given that movie is widely considered to be Night's best, this is a good thing. But then TV star and frequent Ryan Murphy collaborator Sarah Paulson enters and, as given away in the marketing (this movie's marketing is seriously spoiler heavy giving away almost all of the movie) she locks both hero and villain in an asylum, along with Samuel L. Jackson's Elijah Price, now permanently confined to a wheelchair and seemingly catatonic. This second act deals with Paulson's doctor trying to convince the three that they aren't what we all know they are. The middle of this movie is pretty bad and not helped by Sarah Paulson, who is just terrible. She's done solid work on the small screen but she is really out of her element here and it doesn't help that the middle is just kind of boring anyway.There are two central problems with Glass. The first is the tonal problems that are arguably inevitable when trying to make a sequel to two largely unrelated films existing within two different genres. This film alternately feels like a drama, a horror film, and a X-Men movie. The other issue is that the movie has no lead. Samuel L. Jackson is good returning to a character that he gave what was arguably his best non-Tarantino performance as years ago. And he is as close as this movie has to a lead despite the fact that he has next to no dialogue in the first 2/3s of the movie. This is just so unfocused that it doesn't really have a central plot. It just has a bunch of disconnected ideas that are roughly pulled together in the final act.I didn't hate this movie but for a sequel nearly two decades in the making, it feels like Night rushed this thing. More work and careful craftsmanship could have pulled the movie together a bit better. Maybe some of the filler could have been cut. Perhaps Night would have realized that Bruce Willis logically should be the lead here. As is, the movie significantly reduces his role in the second half and that's really where the movie struggles. It's okay, I guess, like Night's last couple movies. As with The Visit and Split, this movie is competent enough to float in our times, when good filmmaking is so rare that we've essentially been trained to praise ""good enough"" movies because at least they're better than the really bad ones. But this is certainly no classic.",Glass

430,markj-02556,BORING!!!,3,28 January 2019,"Glass is one of very few films I ever forced myself to finish in the cinema. Its utterly stupid need to subvert the audiences expectation of the average superhero film, is its main downfall, as it crumbles under the pressure of its own ideas. Glass is a glorious mess, with good aspects like, the acting, cinematography and superb score being drowned by everything else, like the editing and the especially bad writing. Shyamalan is talented and I believe him to be a capable writer/director he just needs to learn restraint.",Glass
431,skylermoore,Great movie!,6,19 January 2019,"Glass isn't a traditional superhero movie. It's a great almost slow burning but hits you with great story telling a cool twists and turns. Completes the trilogy in a respectable way with the possibility of spinoffs.
(When she says she'll move onto the next city) I don't understand the critics hate towards this at all. Just look at the fan reviews.",Glass
432,sclafunk,I'm Sorry it wasn't packed with Lowest Common Denominator CGI superficiality,10,27 January 2019,"There is no way anyone can sit here and tell me with a straight face that this wasn't deeper and done with more passion & attention to detail, without going overboard with fanboy service than any Marvel, (I'm sorry, Disney I mean), or dc movie. These characters have real motivations. It wasn't: let's get discouraged by a big bad guy for 5 mins, only to rally and win every time. Don't tell me that's not how the sequel to Infinity War is gonna go. How much better would it be if Disney didn't tell us for 3 years that Captain Marvel is gonna come save the day in the trailers, and it was a surprise? I mean Marvel/Disney was telling us this before Infinity War and she wasn't even in that.As a real comic book fan, seller, and collector for over two decades(I'm 33), who stopped reading Marvel & DC for the most part Bc of the constant story reboots and 72 variant covers to one issue cashgrabs; I thought this was a brilliant original take on superhumans. Especially Bc we are in a time when Disney cares about nothing but wringing every cent out of the concept, and DC can't seem to figure out how to edit a movie. Honestly I would say don't even read any reviews, good or bad. Doing that before a movie like this is going to subconsciously cause you to look for either negatives or positives and judge the movie as it happens, rather than enjoying and reacting to it as a whole. I thought this was masterful story telling. When this is put with Unbreakable & Split, it's easily the best and most original, creative, super hero trilogy in existence. It's not perfect; the pacing is a a little slow in the middle, but necessary exposition and still interesting. Bruce Willis just seems old and tired, a bit like he doesn't have it anymore; but M Night does a good job of dealing with that. I'm giving it a 10, Bc this is what should be going on in the genre as a whole, and so many people are hating on it with absurdly low scores. Sorry if u want CGI, even without it the fight scenes were dope. There's plenty of that already and much more coming down the pipe, why do u have to hate on this tho? Let it be. There's no way this is a bad movie, objectively speaking. You may not like it and that's fine, But don't poop all over it for others. I mean one of the greatest storytellers Alive, Hideo Kojima, absolutely raved about and loved this flick. That has to mean something.",Glass
433,stemelia21,It was ok but could have been so much better.,6,12 January 2020,I agree with a lot of the other reviews about feeling a bit disappointed at the end of this movie. The idea and the story was very clever and they could have taken it in so many better directions. A lot of the film was entertaining but a lot of it wasn't so it's a bit of a strange one. I've watch both unbreakable and split to which both were good. They just didnt quite get something right in this one.On the plus James McAvoy's acting was again amazing and in fact I felt all of the cast did well.My rating is 6/10 which I felt was fair considering I was a bit unsure about the film. It was like watching a football game that your team should have lost but some how ended up winning (really disappointed with the match but glad you grinded out the result). Give this a watch to finish the trilogy but dont expect to much.,Glass
434,gsbuie,I really liked Glass,7,25 October 2019,"There are a lot of things I could say about Glass but the feeling that overrides anything else is James McAvoy's performance. After seeing Split, I had to see Glass. McAvoy was outstanding in both movies.
For me, M. Night Shyamalananan movies are hit or miss and I think his minor roles are douchie. But Glass was very much a hit! I really liked the story, even though I felt it was pretty much retcon hence very fitting for a movie grounded in comic books, and thought the ends were tired together very well. I was about 50/50 on the ending. I'm OK with it but felt it got needlessly twisty.
Overall a very entertaining movie, I really enjoyed it.",Glass
435,paintedlaughter-56290,Super disappointed!,4,20 April 2019,"I usually like M. Night's movies, but I'm pretty disappointed in this film. It was simply depressing (literally) and overhyped...kinda like The Village.To be fair, the beginning was promising...but confusing. Then two-thirds of the way through, before a climax was even fully reached, the movie plummeted to its death. (Side note...I really wasn't buying the newfound affection that Casey had for Kevin. That type of relationship simply didn't exist in Split as anything more than a ruse.)In conclusion, if a movie maker is going to combine so many original and amazing characters, it needs to be done in a way that is epic and powerful. This just fell seriously short of that bar in my opinion. Plus, the acting was mostly terrible and cheesy. Definitely not M. Night's best work. I was left feeling grateful I hadn't paid more than $2 to see it.",Glass
436,Adam-the-tall-1,James MacAvoy almost saves this movie,4,10 July 2019,"His performance alone was more than worth the price of admission. Real shame Bruce Willis stopped caring. Samuel L Jackson is okay, but subdued throughout the majority of the film. Sarah Paulson is awful and unconvincing.",Glass
437,RustyShacklefordd,Not The Movie You Think It Is!,8,3 February 2019,"After years of waiting for a seqeul to Unbreakable, Glass is finally here and I have to say that while it wasn't exactly what I was expecting, it delievered on being a satisfying conclusion to the Unbreakable trilogy!It was great to see Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson in these roles again after so many years. I wish we had got to see them spend more time together on screen as I personally felt that Bruce Willis was a bit underused, but nevertheless still had plenty of good moments here. James McAvoy was also great once again and we also get to see some of the original actors from Unbreakable reprise their roles as well.I think part of the reason this movie got bad reviews is because people were expecting something more like Split which this is not. This is a much slower-paced and more Drama/Thriller than action movie (although there is some action here and there). I didn't mind this at all though as Unbreakable itself was a slow movie and it was nessecary to build the plot for this film. But what I think really is dividing people is the ending of the film. I will say this was NOT the ending I was expecting at all and because of that I think some people will walk away dissapointed. However, after really absorbing and thinking about the ending and realizing what M. Night was trying to do, I appreciated it a lot more than I originally did.Overall, I think fans of Unbreakable will more than likely enjoy this, but those who are expecting something more in the vein of Split will probably be dissapointed. If you do see it, just make sure to go in with an open mind because this is not going to be the movie you are expecting.",Glass
438,patrick-91640,Mixed feelings,6,17 May 2021,"I really liked Unbreakable and celebrated split. Glass is the grand finale of this triple but to me it doesn't hold up.There are some really good ideas, a capable cast (James mcavoy alone is worth the view!), and keeps the tension up for a long time. The start for example is awesome and the ending is at least some kind of clever.But at the same time there is so much to criticize in this film. Casey's character is flat and completely out of place. The beast is not half the frightening monster it was back in split. And our grown hero gets to doubt himself after just a few words of some random psychologist. Forgotten all the years of inner struggle, doubt, and overcoming them all.So all in all I've mixed feelings. There are strong and also very weak parts. If you like the universe it is worth a view but don't expect anything special.",Glass

They gave the woman who played the doctor far too much screen time. She did a nice job with what she had to work with; but two slices of cheesecake is too much cheesecake.I have long believed that it is possible to do blockbuster movies with little or no money spent on special effects or CGI. that being said, they spent zero dollars on special effects. If they had just spend $35 on some special effects it would have been so much better. Instead I bet you that 99% of the budget for this movie went to pay the 3 main stars who all gave good performances.",Glass

The fights are poorly done and amateurishly made.
Pathetic. Some good psychological moments but too few and far between. Unbreakable was booring but Split was good. The movie just ends stupidly and then ends again with an uninteresting premise for Glass's ho him motivation. Critics were spot on. Ignore the pretenscious fools spouting this as a must see.

A serious internal dialog has to happen here and with studios on whether to let Shamalamadindong near another movie camera or not.

The first act was decent and helped move things along to where the action needs to start. The second act, dare I say it, is downright brilliant !!!! I can't stress enough how good it is and how it really cements the idea of a superhero in a realistic universe. For a few minutes, you feel like Shyamlan has transcended and now will usher in something spectacular for the finale. Now the third act was a bit... strange. There was subversion of expectations. I can see how some would defend it while others would be nonchalant. But no way does it deserve any hate from critics and audiences alike. My only complaint was there were just a few pointless twists and I didn't like how they handled Bruce Willis' character in the end. It didn't make sense. It's like Shyamlan just forgot how well he was handling things and descended again to mediocrity. But still, it was a decent ,and at times thought provoking , watch.",Glass
447,gwest-58160,I wanted to like this. But the critics are right.,3,20 January 2019,"Started off pretty entertaining, was thinking it might be entertaining enough to get an average score of 5/10. But then it got worse and worse to the abysmal ending which was more like a 1/10, so I'll average the score to a 3/10.It didn't really make sense as to why the government kept them in the mental home if their goal was to ultimately dispose of them, but I put this out of my mind to try and enjoy it brainlessly (didn't work). What was the purpose of her trying to convince the hero/villains that they didn't have any powers?McAvoy's dying monologue was so cringeworthy to watch.
And the ending was even worse- felt like the director was going for something so profound but it came out more like pretentious terrible writing. He was trying to stitch the non-sensical plot and messy scenes together into some ""epic"" conclusion- the main hero/villain's family & abductee looking around the train station to see the public learning heroes exist. Absolute garbage.I'm put off any of the director's future work now. This was so badly written. We were laughing how bad the final third of the film was. Couldn't understand how some people were clapping at the end of this one, must be complete morons.P.S. a couple of minor points that were majorly distracting:Why use a young black woman and put prosthetics on her to look old? Her chin looked so weird and ridiculous, it was distracting.. hire an older actor!Also there were scenes where you could blatantly see that the woman was wearing a red hair wig- the mesh cap was so obvious, how did that make it into the final cut?! If the director is that obsessed to have the character be a red head then just hire a red head? Or make the wig look better.",Glass

It's different, intriguing and quite dark compared to more known installments. The use of superpowers is really limited and being an origin trilogy the number of different superpowers is kept at a minimum. There are a lot of unnerving moments. Characters can be creepy and cynical. The cinematography is pragmatical, contained and never exaggerated. If you like explosions and crazy combat scenes, this is not the right genre for you. Overall it's engaging enough to be watched by interested people. It's definitely suggested to watch the previous chapters to better grasp the three protagonists that compose the center of the movie. As expect from the director, there's a sort of double twist. Again, nothing spectacular and something somewhat expected. You may want to watch it but you may not as well.",Glass
451,TheJohnnyPHreak,A Good End To The Anti-Marvel Trilogy,7,20 January 2019,"The name M. Night Shyamalan brings a lot of thoughts to the mind. Most of them nowadays are jokes and few negative connotations. But a while back this was a director who was being called the next Spielberg. He came out of the gate with two hugely successful films The Sixth Sense, and Unbreakable. But then with a bunch of misses to follow (Signs, The Village, Lady In The Water, The Happening) he became a pun of himself. I wasn't a huge fan of him to start. I'm still not a fan of The Sixth Sense. (I can get into that another time) But Unbreakable was a good deconstruction of the superheroes of film. Shyamalan got back up on his successful horse with The Visit. Then we get a secret unofficial sequel *spoilers* to Unbreakable with Split.Split was his rise back into the mainstream success and spotlight. It's a great character thriller (that I'll be reviewing soon). Now we come upon the end of his Eastrail 177 trilogy with Glass. What I didn't notice is that each film is titled for a specific character. And during much of each film that character is the main focus. Glass does have a lot of juggling to do. But when Mr. Glass is the focus, he takes center stage. Glass takes place a few months after the events of Split. Kevin Wendall Crumb is loose at the powerful Horde, still stalking women who are not pure. We find out David Dunn (Willis) is still walking the streets taking out the evil of society. H's been doing it for a while with his son Joseph as his ear and eyes of the world. (He's Alfred to Dunn's Batman) He also has been dubbed as The Overseer.It just happens that The Overseer meets the Horde and they both get taken to a mental facility that happens to be housing Mr. Glass. A doctor, Sarah Paulson's character has been assigned to work with all three to prove they aren't superheroes and villains before they all are permanently locked up for good. That's as much as you know going into this film. It's a dramatic thriller, not an action film. This is an M. Night film. Don't expect an all-out action film like the trailers has been promoting. There are really only two action scenes, one on one fights that are interestingly filmed. This film much like Unbreakable is to deconstruct the characters, find out what drives them and figure out are they really superhuman. We know the answer but the characters in this world don't.M. Night is on his game in this film. It doesn't have the darkness of Unbreakable, but it does have the emotional moments and characterization that some of us love. Willis is the best I've seen him in a long while. Jackson seems to be having the most fun. He's off screen for a majority of the film. It's only when things are revealed that he gets to take the stage. He's really good as the villain with so many layers who is always one step ahead. As much as I love seeing him play a hero, Jackson is just as good a villain with Mr. Glass and Kingsman's Valentine. (Can someone please tell me why this man doesn't have Oscar gold yet?!)As good as Jackson is McAvoy doesn't just steal but he makes this film what it is. It wouldn't be as entertaining, as talked about, a thrilling, as emotional without his performance. Certain scenes he's changing identities on the fly, it's so impressive. Each character inside Kevin Wendall Crumb is fleshed out, even though some get more screen time than others. I know because of the type of film it is he won't get any award love at the end of the year but I definitely think he should. Anya Taylor-Joy was the breakout star of Split and she continues to shine. She gets some great character moments (some of the best in the film). She's on her way to be a full-fledged leading lady.Sarah Paulson, who I always love, doesn't get the best character. It's not her performance but more like what the script doesn't give her. On screen she's good but her character isn't that deep. We don't get to know more about her. And the reasons for her being assigned to his case are shrouded in secret until almost the last frames of the film. But she is good just she could have been better if the character was written better. You have Sarah Paulson, let her dive in all the way. I'm not going to spoil anything but I do have to mention that along with every M. Night film there is a twist. It's a huge twist, but it's one if you have a keen eye you might see coming in from left field. I didn't hate it like I've seen many. But it's a plot twist that is very divisive. I can see what critics are not enjoying. I also see audiences rolling with it. This ending was almost inevitable with the way all the films play out.Glass is a fitting send off to M. Night's ""superhero and villain"" trilogy. He wants to put extraordinary people in the real world. For the most part, he does that well. This, as a friend told me, is the anti-Marvel series. It really is. M. Night does leave things open where he could (or some other director with dramatic talents I'm looking at you David Fincher) take over to keep this world alive. I enjoyed Glass as much as I thought I would. The performances drive the film with the story going through some very similar superhero movie points. (Some feel lifted from the MCU) I wouldn't call this my favorite film of the series (that goes to Split) but with that film and this I think M. Night is on his way back to be a positive household name for filmmaking.",Glass

James McAvoy is on top form playing the many different characters that form his split personality. Willis and Jackson bring the story together.

Written and directed by M Night ShyamalanExpectations are poison. One way or the other, those expectations have no hope of being met and this is why I choose to avoid them at any cost. Well fellow film friends and poor unfortunate souls, I have fallen victim to my own rules. I succumbed to expectations. I really enjoyed Split. I remember recommending it and giving the movie a solid strong B. Unbreakable is a movie that I love dearly. I love the score. I can listen to it on repeat as often as possible. I love several scenes and the amazing performances all across the board. It was a movie that was ahead of its time.This brings us to the sequel to both of those movies, Glass. I was intrigued with that ending scene in Split showing Bruce Willis watching the news about the Horde. I could not wait to see what happens next. I should have known better. You can't get your hopes up when it comes to M Night. He wants to have a more low key character crossover movie. He wants to take that character drama aspect of Unbreakable and apply to the story formula of the Avengers. It doesn't work. Not for the reasons you think it might not work.Bruce Willis does not care one bit in this movie. Honestly I think the last time I saw him give a genuine honest performance was in Looper. Not for M Night though, no sir. I wonder how much he owes people and various agencies because there is no reason for him to continue acting. He very visibly hates every single he is in the movie. So why continue doing something that gives you this much displeasure? James McAvoy is having the time of his life. He is giving an acting tour de force. He could use this one movie for his acting reel. It's insane how good he is. Samuel L Jackson is great as well. He always turns in quality work. Everyone else is fine. It's the story beats that give trouble.The girl who was let go at the end of Split is now suddenly suffering from Stockholm syndrome and has a thing for him. When did that happen? I was lost on this but I suppose it was necessary to set up each of them having someone by their side. It took me out of their story. The other thing is the silliness that is having water be your weakness. Water is almost everywhere. A good bottle of water can stop and that makes you a rather lame superhero.The biggest problem is the ending. I'm not going to discuss specifics about the ending but it really takes the wind out of the sails. It's something that could have worked if it were moved to the beginning of the film. It would have made the film more conventional I suppose. It has that ending of Unbreakable surprise but it brings things down. The whole ending brings everything down. I was disappointed and I don't say something like that lightly. I give this movie a C.",Glass
459,EnoVarma,It's a perfectly acceptable conclusion to the trilogy,6,18 January 2019,"And thereby unacceptable. Unbreakable and Split are so good that they deserved something better than this cramped up try-too-hard. Glass is still an endlessly intriguing, different kind of movie, but MNS can't quite make it all work. Had he followed the wisdom of ""less is more"", Glass might have been the great movie that hides within it.Unbreakable was an inspired, beautiful, deeply felt take on the comic book phenomena. Split was a suspenseful, tight little thriller. Glass aspires to be a magnum opus, but often MNS forgets that he's not writing a novel, but directing a movie. So, Glass becomes too talky and expository. Same points are repeated too often. When it is an actual movie and not radio with faces, it's often very good. However, the third act feels like a let down by refusing to spread out. I get what MNS was trying to do and say, but as drama, it doesn't work.Glass, rightly, focuses on the actors. McAvoy is, again, very good, although his ability to manouver between Kevin's different personalities has lost something of its freshness. (By comparison, Tatiana Maslany's work on Orphan Black feels deeper.) Paulson isn't quite convincing, but Willis is fine and charismatic. But, for me, the movie belongs to Mr. Jackson who's the only one really able to convey his character's past. And he does it beautifully with a lot of restrain.Glass is an ambitious but uneven and less than surefooted work by an exceptionally talented filmmaker.",Glass

461,bishysbus,The weakest of the trilogy,6,26 October 2021,"It's slow but it brings together the ending of the trilogy (Unbreakable, Split, Glass). Still very entertaining and a psychotic performance again from Janes McAvoy as Crumb and 23 other personalities.The ending is a bit of an anti-climax and a downside to the film because the audience should have got more, seen the reaction of the public to what had happened. But it just ends.Watch all three in order, but Glass has an element of how bad a Director M. Night Shyamalan can be, and if it wasn't for a brilliant cast, this film could have been one of many of his stinkers.Overall it's not bad though.",Glass
462,m-maru,Best trilogy !,10,21 January 2019,"M. Night Shyamalan did it again, an excellent and great movie. I was surprised and exceeded my expectations. The closing of this trilogy of superheroes with a very good and quite original plot. James McAvoy (deserves the Oscar nomination), Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson have a chemistry that goes through the screen, with EXCELLENT performances and that do not disappoint and the rest of the cast, very good. I loved all the ¨easter eggs¨ for the comics, the photography and a very good soundtrack. The last scene is EXCELLENT, with an unexpected twist and a conclusion that left me speechless and surprised me. The best movie of the trilogy with a more than perfect and epic closure.",Glass
463,patboldt,The Shyalaman Movie that went above and beyond,8,20 January 2019,"I'm going to be 100% honest with this review. I was prepared to hate this movie! I went into this prepared to hate this movie as I hate Lady in the Water, the Happening, and The Last Airbender. Going into this movie knowing the critics hated it didn't help matters.By all heavenly accounts, I am so glad to find that the critics are wrong this time.If you are looking for a generic superhero movie that doesn't take risks or instead a movie that doesn't really carry that interesting of characters or storytelling you will dislike this movie. This is not your average superhero film, and that is part of why it is so awesome! Yes, the die hard haters will be able to find problems and yeah it's not perfect but if you go into this movie with an open mind, not only will you find one of the greatest Shyalaman films, you'll find a film that really lived up to its expectations.The acting in this movie is on point. Not one character interaction felt faked or forced, everything felt natural. The performances felt genuine and the characters felt genuine. I found a way to connect to these characters or at the very least understand where they were coming from in regard to their actions and motivations. There are gut wrenching scenes, provocative scenes, and brilliant scenes all woven around a narrative that felt real. I kept asking what was going to happen next and if that is the kind of story you love you will adore this movie.A lot of people may find the ending to be cheesy or for some plot elements to be too convenient, but remember, it just a movie. You can't judge every single scene by nitpicking every single detail, at some point, you have to open yourself to the experience of watching the story. Humor only arrives when it feels earned, emotional moments don't get spoiled by bad writing, and action scenes are not inserted to keep the unimpressed audience invested. I really mean it when I say that this movie feels important, it feels as if you are watching a brilliant story unfold before your eyes. For those brave enough to embark into the world of this movie you will find a story that hits you in all the right places.Obviously, this film isn't perfect. You will find flaws if you try hard enough. I really don't think you need an excessive amount of suspension of disbelief when you watch this film. It's easy to be invested, especially since this movie has stakes and takes risks. This film is actively taking risks and it's doing something more than just being a stereotypical Hollywood blockbuster. And if nothing else I say convinces you that this movie is good at least remember this.If you won't call this film amazing (which it is) at least call it creative, refreshing, and smart. I wholeheartedly believe that Glass has all of these things. 9/10. A pleasant surprise.",Glass
464,SharkByteAudioProductions,Serviceable but a complete disappointment,6,17 April 2019,"Glass has moments of greatness with its lofty ambitions but falls completely flat as a finale to a trilogy. The execution of the plot doesn't give justice to any of the film's main protagonists and that's the first issue with the film.Since Glass has no clear central protagonist to focus on and develop, it's hard for the plot to keep focus and develop each character consistently; motivations felt all over the place. On top of this, the introduction of new characters felt completely unnecessary by the finale and you wish the 3 main characters were the main focus of the plot. Minutes of screen time is given to characters babbling when it really could be actually developing charactersSecondly, Glass is mainly set in one location, like Split, but fails to deliver the same tension and anticipation as Split. This was likely an attempt to save money in the budget but it didn't work! Shyamalan should have took advantage of lighting and close quarters tension rather than opting for the scenarios he did.The score is decent - you get a mix of Split's excellent disturbing sound design and beats from Unbreakable and some scenes are great fan service (especially some deleted scenes from Unbreakable). James McAvoy is busting his nuts off in this role once again and nails his performance - it's just a shame his character isn't put to good use.Overall, it's okay to be disappointed by this finale and the conclusion feels rushed and completely unsatisfactory as an end of the trilogy. A massive shame.",Glass
465,cinemawithcj,Glass - Cinema with CJ Review,8,26 January 2019,"Glass is M. Night Shyamalan bringing together two of his separate movie universes under one supposed trilogy, somehow making Unbreakable and Split legibly into one world.As a jarring pin at the end of Split, it was somehow stupid enough to just work. As an entire film...Yeah. I actually dig it.Apparently those sentiments are not shared across the board, but other than some flaws, Glass is a fun and interesting exploration of comic books and superheroes, all while building on the previous two films this is a sequel to.Glass is not perfect. It's mostly in Bruce Willis still not really being on the form he used to be in probably over more than a decade by now, and Samuel L Jackson - despite being the titular character for this one - is still quite underused. The true weakness, however, is in the final act. Which is where we truly see that Shyamalan needed to cut corners. A true bottle episode of a movie, we're given a big tease of a showdown when in reality we get a handwave that's certainly their way of edging around the budget they have.The film is full of big ideas, but once they get outside the hospital most of the movie takes place in, you realise they can only go so far with it.It finds its strengths through its characters. McAvoy is once again playing a strong platform for his acting abilities, and though he has to unfortunately share the limelight this time, a lot of character stuff works here. Glass is definitely the large leap between trying to bring Unbreakable and Split to the same level, while also teasing comic book worthy team-ups, but it's the explorations of character and motivations that make the film.Sarah Paulson rounds up the leads with a brilliant performance. It feels like she's another actress who can rarely do wrong, and here, playing Dr Ellie Staple, you actually have a great foil to what Unbreakable and Split have led us to believe about our characters.That's the thing with Glass, it's at its most interesting and engaging when it plays with expectations and meets expectations. We're giving the counterpoints towards what we and other characters believe to be true with what we've seen, and we also get the meta-textual exploration of superheroes and comic books, made all the more fun when you have Samuel L Jackson recruit an avenging villain.M. Night Shyamalan is a talented filmmaker with ideas that don't always stick. For every Unbreakable we have almost every movie after Unbreakable, and Glass walks the tightrope across brilliance and disappointment. His craft and concepts here work well, though. It's great to see Willis' hero persona be seen with elements of horror. His work with Mike Gioulakis on cinematography duty gives us some great POV shots, and while the poster and trailer shot of the trio being interviewed by Paulson makes no sense visually, you buy into it because it's just a great visual that pops and would otherwise make that sequence bland.Praise can't be given to his cameo, though. Oh Shyamalan.Glass gives us a great Samuel L Jackson performance, so much so that we wish we had so much more. It's sad to see the titular character be given not enough, especially when he's pivotal to the story. This is supposed to be his film, but it doesn't quite feel that way.We're given so many promises and we don't quite get vindication. Red herrings are abound, but it sucks that it highlights even further how small scale the movie really is.Glass would be much better if it went more one way or another. It's tough having 19 years between Unbreakable and the explosion of comic book movies between it. Expectations are getting higher, when really this movie should want to stay more of the same. It wants to do the crossover of unexpected crossovers, but it also is at war with the scale of Unbreakable and the high-concept offered by Split.Overall, Glass is strong, but not superhuman. It falters due to its scope and scale, but it has it where it's characters are concerned. We are given great performances over great concepts and ideals. Your milage may vary on the smart enjoyment in comic book exploration and its mirror on the real world. It may also vary on how much Shyamalan you can take, because the final act does suffer from a bit of overload. What can be taken from this film is that it is fun, interesting, a bit too long, and reusing footage from Unbreakable is not a substitute for Bruce Willis' acting.CJ",Glass
466,tomasthebombcom,Great trilogy,8,20 May 2019,"I honestly liked this finale. Many people hated it, and whatever, that's their opinion, but forget them this movie is great. It's weird, but hey. It's M Night Shyamalan. What'd you expect? This movie be good.",Glass
467,JohnVerset,Best of the Trilogy,7,9 April 2019,"'Glass' was the best of the trilogy directed by M. Night. This must be worth be your time. It's not anything like the previous movies, this movie is full of suspense thriller, sci-fi,drama and action but less just like the previous movies.Let me recap the trilogy beginning from 2000:In 2000, M. Night Shyamalan released 'Unbreakable' in which David Dunn, a security guard, survives a fatal train accident. Elijah Price (Mr. Glass) who is the founder and manager of Limited Edition shop, claims that David is blessed with superhuman abilities.
The story was mindblowing but was not enough for a supernatural movie. It was short and was like extended. His supernatural powers are invulnerability and super strength.
6.5/10In 2016, he released 'Split' in which Kevin, who is suffering from DID (Dissociative Identity Disorder) and has 23 personalities, kidnaps three teenagers. The three teens must figure out their way out before he unleashes his 24th personality (The Beast).All of the 24 personalities were singly known as ""The Horde"".
This was absolutely amazing. The Horde is my favourite character from all three. James McAvoy is absolutely perfect for this role.
7.6/10And then in 2019, he released 'Glass' in which after pursuing Kevin Wendell Crumb and the multiple identities that reside within. David Dunn finds himself locked in a mental hospital alongside his archenemy, Elijah Price and they must contend with a psychiatrist who is out to prove the trio do not actually possess superhuman abilities.
This was full of suspense thriller and confusion. Mr. Glass is a megamind and he always have a real plan other than having just a plan. I hate to admit it but this was the best mindblowing movie M. Night have ever written or directed. But I don't know about ""The Sixth Sense"" because I've never seen it.
7.4/10",Glass
468,chris-laughren,"Stupid, stupid movie.",1,3 April 2019,"Repetative, meandering, confusing and definitely a waste of time. Don't be expecting an epic flick.",Glass
469,dantharpe,Duh!,1,22 May 2019,"Starts off great... but, goes downhill fast. What begins with a solid story line takes a dive into an empty finish. Shyamalan, sadly, seems to have exhausted all his creative talent to complete this trilogy this way. The movie is senseless, and for the movie-goer its a waste of time and money.
On a positive side, the acting was superb less Samual L. Jackson. He is a ""B' Character actor and always will be. Had he kept his mouth shut he probably would have won an award... but once he spoke, the move lost all integrity.
This movie can be characterized as a perversion of natural and rational thought... sad it was brought to the screen by Director M. Night Shyamalan, whom I once admired.",Glass
470,Guenniminator,Was it really necessary?,7,7 February 2019,"(May contain spoilers)Does anyone still remember ""Unbreakable""? No? No matter, it's already 19 years ago. But you should take a look at it to be able to follow the plot of this movie 100%. If this movie was planned as a trilogy almost 20 years ago, then it's a psychological masterpiece. ""Split"", on the other hand, is supposed to be the second part, even though this one has absolutely nothing to do with ""Unbreakable"" and only gets the reference in ""Glass"". Um, yes.Curiously enough, ""Split"" can be regarded as ""own"" film, seen and understood, who wants to see ""Glass"" should - or better ""must"" have seen both others before.One thing is for sure: James McAvoy is brilliant again, overshadowing Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson. McAvoy rescues this movie with his performance!",Glass
471,sonicheze8,The end to a trilogy spanning 19 years,7,7 April 2019,"I remember the first time I watched Unbreakable. It was one of my first few M. Night Shyamalan films. I didn't expect much from it, yet what I got was an unconventional drama about a superhero. It was incredibly original, riveting in the sense that there was a subtlety of mystery in the storyline. I was taken into the mind of M.Night Shyamalan and how he wanted to tell a story to be remembered.But oh dear, there was a large void in his films after unbreakable. He couldn't match his own forte. His movies missed the mark more often than not. He became more and more disregarded. But I couldn't forget his style of films, that twist at the end waiting to come out and surprise you. That feeling can't be frequently reproduced.Hence, came Split and then Glass. Glass is an interesting approach to a finale of comic-book inspired films. The movie still roots itself in reality, and that might sound strange coming from a superhero movie. But it works. I would say the first half of the film is an authentic sequel to Unbreakable. It's more psychological and deliberate. The portrayals from the characters are done well, as the actors themselves are experienced, although I felt Bruce Willis could up the ante a bit more.Yet, I couldn't help feeling like the movie almost missed it's target again, especially with a particular reveal. While the movie isn't what most will expect, I think the movie's message and ideas are solid, even if they aren't conveyed very convincingly. I also think there are some parts that could have been less stressed on such as the minor's characters as they don't add much to the core theme.However, overall I think the movie warrants a viewing as it is still a great film albeit with some flaws. If you can look past them you might see just see. See a glimpse of what made M. Night Shyamalan one of the most promising directors of our time.",Glass

One guy working at a prison with the most deranged mental prisoners comes to work, see that he's replacement guy is missing, check the cameras and clearly see 2 dead guards in the beds where the prisoners should be...instead of hitting the alarm bell..which is his only job description btw he goes in alone to check things out. I mean...cmon some limit to the redicolous please.Furthermore every scene is so strange, almost like that didnt care at all. Guards walk slowly toward the killer guy like clickbait, a psychologist ask a poor girl who had previously been kidnapped and raped by a dude to save the world.

474,Gorillaboi,A Good Conclusion to a Great trilogy,8,29 January 2019,"I'm really perplexed by the consistency of these movie critics. As a movie fan that looks for originality, good characters and interesting plots I can't understand why mediocrity (e.g. Wonder Woman, Creed II, etc.) is given extra high praise, and something like Mr Glass is harshly criticised.Going into this, I'm glad I stayed away from all reviews, ratings and even the trailers. With an uncontaminated mind, I watched an MNS movie that done a very good job in trying to reach the very high bar raised by its very unique and plot-twisting predecessors (Unbreakable and Split). If it fails to match them, it can be forgiven. Remarkably, this movie franchise is built on the speciality of surprising/charming unsuspecting viewers. To do this once, in the first, is great. To do it twice, with the sequel, is exceptional. But to do it thrice at the same level to an audience that is fully aware of your secrets, is a near impossibility.But despite that, Mr Glass still delivers a very satisfactory conclusion. And in the process, it offers a story that's still consistent (in its quality of telling and entertainment) with Unbreakable at least. The characters and acting are fantastic - especially James McAvoy, who's entertaining as ever in his deliverance of multiple personalities.So in conclusion, I would still recommend you go and watch this. It's a movie that makes an attempt to be original. This, it seems, is a quality that's severely lacking in modern cinema. And something the critics should be ashamed of in their biased approach to reviewing movies across the industry.",Glass
475,biggiebaby,Insipid,3,14 July 2019,"A bloated self righteous attempt of MKS padding his future career. Instead of what could have been a tight suspenseful action yarn, its just a Marvelesque attempt to set up yet another never ending comic book franchise.
So sick of this comic book crap!",Glass
476,nmn34,"Shyamalan, Stop Making Movies",8,29 January 2019,"And get your ass into comics. The man understands superheroes better than any comic book writer out there right now. Tom King is currently writing a DC series of all the DC superheroes going through therapy and Shyamalan one ups him in less time than it takes for people to get angry about Batgirl's butt as she shows the exit wound from when the Joker shot her. Comic book stores are closing at an alarming rate, DC is laying off staff, and Marvel has been forced to strong arm retailers to get their terrible books onto shelves where they rot. And the only thing that people in the business are willing to do is point at manga doing exceptionally well, willfully ignoring their irrelevancy as the Japanese take their job. In such a bleak future for the medium, stories like this would be a saving grace.Shyamalan gets a bad rep which for the most part he deserves, but the man still has some very bright flashes of talent. He knows his characters, and while the actors do an exceptional job bringing them to life, he still knows how to write them. Mr. Glass (Samuel Jackson) is a genius in intellect and a fundamentalist in spirit. Comics are his scripture and their tropes his law, so while The Horde (James McAvoy) and David Dunn (Bruce Willis) waver, he is the one that remains absolute. The Horde is filled with contradictions, not every personality believes and they're devotion to The Beast can be called into question. As the secrets of The Beast are revealed, that all of his powers can be explained somewhat convincingly, he grows nervous as he loses his flock. And McAvoy deserves special accolades as he plays so many dynamic characters in one role, transitioning through them flawlessly. Dunn was convinced by Mr. Glass of his powers, so he is the most susceptible to Dr. Staple (Sarah Paulson) dissection but has the strength of character to defy it. He doesn't need the assistance of someone else to rebound, the threat that Mr. Glass and The Horde are going to kill a lot of people is enough a call for action for him to bring out his powers and be a hero.Allusions of grandeur make for a great theme in this movie. Throughout the movie we are reminded of the Osaka Tower, a new skyscraper that has garnered the world's attention. Then its revealed that Mr. Glass plans to destroy that tower as a coming out for superheroes, as he plans it to be the arena for the penultimate battle between Dunn and The Beast. Then they duke it out in the asylum parking lot. This works wonderfully for this kind of movie however because up to this point we have been told they were all deluding themselves. Dunn's ability to see a person's crimes is explained as just his security instincts. He finds The Beast when he runs into Dennis, his childish personality acting unusual and wiping off brick dust from the hideout he was in. The Beast's strength is great but not beyond human limitations, and his prodigious wall climbing explained by Kevin's, the main personality, interest in the sport. While their powers are later proven to be real, the encroachment of the mundane makes the story intriguing.But then comes the Shyamalan curse, the twist ending. Spoiler, all three are killed by a secret cabal of people trying to keep superheroes a secret to which Dr. Staple is a part of. And that isn't a bad idea in itself. On paper, it fits perfectly within a comic book esthetic. But somewhere between pen and paper, it goes horribly wrong. There is no proper build for the twist nor allusion of such a group, so their introduction has absolutely no impact. The camera zooms in on the cloverleaf tattoo on the SWAT team, and it is completely meaningless as we have no context for the tattoo. Dr. Staple then reveals herself to Dr. Dunn, and the organization is a downtown restaurant and its patrons. There is still some good in this, Mr. Glass manages to see through her their whole plan was really a cover for his true intention, but even then, the payoff is kind of weak. He forwards it to some of the characters to the previous movies who proceed to put it online and prove the existence of superheroes. And not one 'fake and @%!' comment? Has no one in Hollywood been on the internet? And on top of that, it still fails to explain why only three people have such potential. Maybe if we saw some unusual people watching it, people that have some sort of mundane version of a super power, and get inspired, the ending would have more impact.This movie's ending is a serious flaw, as Red Letter Media's Mike put it, ""Its good until it isn't,"" but the prior material is an interesting dissection of what makes a great American superhero comic. It shows that Shyamalan understands what a superhero is and its a shame that he doesn't do more with it. If there is anyone that can save the American comic market, its him.",Glass

The premise of the film itself however is disappointing as instead of interesting fantasy thriller we get common teenage comic book super hero meets Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find them which seems to dumb things down.

It reminded me of some of these user reviews where they turn a 1/2 page review into 3 pages--just rambling because they like to hear themselves talk. The script writer(s) must have enjoying hearing themselves talk. Also, I found the storyline based on the psychiatrist's multilevel agenda somewhat unbelievable. The BIG WOW moments came out as small to medium wows. The action sequences were good. McAvoy's performance was amazing. Everyone else did OK. I found this to be a mediocre movie overall--though in all fairness, some of Shyamalan's movies have to be viewed several times to get to the real heart of the message. I would suggest seeing it with low to moderate expectations at best. 6/10 for me.",Glass
490,phaylen,"Brilliant, original, future classic",10,3 February 2019,"The snob-critics of glossy magazines and aloof newspapers with the third section devoted to a snarky review by some tight collared, middle aged failed filmmaker will never- read again- NEVER give a review on the entertainment value of a motion picture. While they hoist up Victorian war dramas and grandiose adaptations of uppity novels of yore by long dead authors, they will rarely appreciate a modern, original masterpiece. Their bogged down egos simply will not let them. This is why critics flog every M. Night film in favor of Queens in petticoats speaking old English and the Academy awards costumery over creativity.Let's be real. Glass is a powerful, imaginative film that packs just as much punch as any of the dozens of remakes, rehashes, reimaginings, reboots and sequels in the Marvel and DC universe, if not more. It dares to create a limitless, reshaped landscape separate from the think-hive that gives weight to the storytelling rather than simple optics.Watch Glass. Watch all of M. Night's films... and Guillermo Del Toro's. There are few filmmakers who are crafting works that will be tomorrows classics like them.",Glass
491,ilikeweirdstuffs,"The ""unrealistic"" twist of things being too realistic.",10,9 April 2019,"I rarely ever give anything a 10/10. That is something only deserved by movies that have a good IRL impact on the world. This is one such movie.Some reviewers seem to have copied the ""ugh a twist doesnt make a movie m night"" thing that was applicable to soaaáme of his previous movies. This is probably the downside of going into a movie with preconceptions based on the crew - and the reason why critics couldn't ""get"" this movie the way it was intended.
If you do away with preconceptions and try to watch it neutrally you are guaranteed to not find it lacking.The world it paints is a bit closer to home than other movies. That is something to be kept in mind. And in this context the dialogue is realistic, and despite complaints that it's too wordy not a single one of those words is wasted. The acting was on point from every one involves. If not immediately, then definitely in retrospect. The combination of two previous unrelated movies of different genres into a third one of a third genre is executed masterfully. The entire movie is in keeping with the restrained down to earth and thus oddly ""realistic"" portrayal of the universe.Last not least the message is completely on point. Without spoiling anything:
Everyone wants to be good. Therefore no one works entirely in the shadows. Problems and the overcoming greatness dont just exist but arise from interactions.
These are things we'd all do well to remember IRL.Thus the format, the backround, the tone, and the characters are all perfecly supportive of the core of this movie all without it seeming too preachy.Watch it!",Glass
492,alvesmarceloalves-73751,Shyamalan disappoints in trilogy outcome,4,25 January 2019,"I do not know if since 2000, when he released ""Unbreakable,"" M. Night Shyamalan had these two questions in his head: ""What if the world really had superheroes? How would they be?"" When launching the great ""Split"" two years ago, however, it seemed increasingly clear the director's idea of creating his own trilogy of original superheroes in an industry where much of the revenue has come from the adaptations from the Marvel and DC Comics.Now that ""Glass,"" the third volume of his story hits theaters, the feeling that remains is that of frustration. Between the irony and the attempt to build a mythology of its own, Shyamalan got lost in the middle of the road in a film that leaves much to be desired and with a script that did not know where to go.""Glass"" would win more if it revolved around the irony that Shyamalan tries to create in different parts of the film. The way he mocks superhero stories, as he jokes about Marvel (quoted from the cover of a magazine) and the scripts of these same movies and the comics themselves. Mainly from the obsession of Mister Glass (Samuel L. Jackson) on the subject.But irony requires subtlety and the final third of the film is driven so heavily by the director that he loses his hand and turns everything into a caricature. And, worse, it takes itself seriously to create a whole new mythology in what would be its history of particular origin from a group commanded by Dr. Staple (Sarah Paulson). Maybe that was even her intention. But I think it did not work out well.In the midst of all this, even the brilliant work of James McAvoy, making a man of 24 such different personalities is kind of lost. Much of the strength of his character is erased by turning him into a mere doormat of Glass, the eternal antagonist of Vigilante (Bruce Willis).In fact, the three main characters are apathetic and without any chemistry. But worst of all lies in the stillborn presence of the three characters who are the right arms of the three protagonists. Casey (Anya-Taylor Joy), the survivor of the Beast's captivity, Joseph (Spencer Treat Clark), son of Dunn, and Mrs. Price (Charlayne Woodard), Glass's mother, figure out from nowhere to anything in poor interpretations.Finally, we have a whole plot in a psychiatric hospital that works just like a smoke screen for a group of people about whom nothing is known. An interrogation that Shyamalan leaves in the air for what is perhaps a future project, but which also kills the proposal that was tried to take between the discredit and the acceptance of the powers. There is an attempt of several plot twists that do not work in no time.And with that, ""Glass"" walked to a big disappointment. A delirium of Shyamalan who had everything to succeed at the end of ""Split"". That generated expectation. But whose result almost thwarted how many director's bad works.",Glass

494,nirome,Very average outing by Shyamalan,6,31 January 2019,"Not that I was expecting a lot from this one. Unlike most, I wasn't blown away and awestruck by Split. In my opinion, that was an OK movie. It was better that most of his latest movies before that, but I honestly didn't consider it better than something like say The Visit. What I really took away from that one was the amazing multi-layered performance by James McAvoy in what it's clearly his best performance to date.
It was nice to reunite with Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson's characters after all this time, but I must say, the promised clash between its main characters, which was the main point on which this movie hinged upon, was underwhelming at best. Started nicely enough but once they all get together to the psychiatric facility, where most of the action occurs, the movie grinds to a halt. It picks up at the end and you get your standard Shyamalan twist at the end, but regretfully, this isn't enough to save the movie from being quite average. Was expecting more.",Glass

Great performances from the three main actors, but something was missing. For some reason, I'm slightly dissatisfied. But this wasn't one of M Night's bombs. 6 out of 10 isn't horrible at all.

-Great interactions between the main characters
-Insanely great performances from the leads
-The music
-Mr. Glass.
-The endingCons:-I specifically disliked the son. He was very awkward and unnatural.
-Not enough of the side characters
-Lack of foreshadowing of the secret organization. If they had shown the tattoo from the beginning, it would have been better. (Unless they did and I just didn't notice.)
-The endingI absolutely loved the ending. Mr. Glass jump-started his own Comicbook universe, the thing he admired and was obsessed with. I also really enjoyed the ruse, of how he talked about a final showdown at the tower only to confuse the organization and to look away from his actual plot. As he said- ""It's not a limited edition. It's an origin story."" Once he said that, I fell for it. I fell in love with the movie.Of course, this ending isn't for everyone.

Glass is one of those films where you either love it or hate it. I never listen to critics as they've been so wrong about films lately. I'm in the group of people that loved it. First of all this is not a Superhero movie it's a clever film with some very interesting dialogue. It's a film you need to sit pay attention and listen. Split was also the same I got so engrossed in the movie I didn't want it to end. These are my kind of films to be perfectly honest.
James McAvoy is again outstanding. His ability to go from one voice to another and you can see it in the way he delivers his performance.
Also got to mention Samuel L Jackson and Bruce Willis. These two have a great chemistry on screen and again they show us what made Unbreakable so good to watch 19 years ago.
It was visually appealing with the fight scenes and the way M Night Shyamalan directs this is very clever.
Again like Split I got so absorbed into it that I forgot where I was.
So two thumbs up from me",Glass

500,TheDreadedChampion2019,GLASS,5,14 February 2019,"M Night Shyamalan forces an unnecessary trilogy out of ""Unbreakable"" (2000) and ""Split"" (2017) with the third of act GLASS. In this film, David Dunn (Bruce Willis), Mr. Glass (Samuel L. Jackson) and Jimmy McAvoy's character from ""Split"" are all thrown into a mental hospital together and interrogated by Sarah Paulson, a woman who specializes in treating patients who believe that they are superheroes. That is the basic premise, but of course as with all of Nights films, not everything as is it seems... This movie Was not really needed. That little ending to ""Split"" with David Dunn showing up was cool and unexpected and it served its purpose. There really didn't need to be another movie to follow, at least not this particular story. I found it to be boring and uninteresting for the most part. You don't get enough out of Bruce Willis's character, he doesn't say much, and he doesn't have enough to do. The dramatic heft isn't really there for him. They sort of give him a conflict but its not expanded upon enough. I liked the beginning scenes with his son, who is still a great actor all these years later. James McAvoy was pretty good as the split personality dude but what they do with his story was a little stupid. Samuel Jackson was good as Glass when he finally got some time on screen. Anna Taylor Joy is in it but doesn't do much so if you were hoping she was gonna be doing a lot, prepare to be let down...oh yeah and M night pops up for his usual cringe cameo and puts all his other performances to shame. This one made his part in ""Signs"" look Oscar worthy. Wow what a bad scene...overall this was one of those sequels where they retroactively rewrite the other films (kind of like Spectre did for Casino Royale, or Lethal Weapon 2 for Lethal Weapon 1...) to fit what they're trying to do with this one. It doesn't stand on its own in the way the other two did. Unbreakable was a fine film, as was Split. This one was sub par. Some good moments, some good performances, but overall not very good...

#3: Deus Vult. They die because of a unprepared, untold, and clueless to the viewer organization. Hey lets kill of the heroes, but how? Ahhh let's make all the people members of a random secret organization that was not even pointed about before. Not even a little tease. Yeah, maybe had 2 movies to prepare, but let's do it in just 1 minute scene.

We went to the movies to see David Dunn, The Beast, and Glass, the same way as we go for any other universe movies to see the main characters. But now they are gone, so, to see their relatives? ??

#7: wouldn't David Dunn's wife death is something important to be shown? At least the psychologist pointed that as a reason for the deliria (inside her own plan), but we never got in depth.

Glass was boring with no more than a few fight scenes, all poorly filmed in some kind of weird first-person style which made no sense. The plot was pretty much nonsense, with a psychiatrist who's supposed goal was to convince the main characters that they weren't superpowered.

Sarah Paulson. No thanks. Annoying voice, peanut shaped head, extremely questionable and sickening taste in romantic relationships.Bruce Willis was barely in the movieBruce Willis' son in the movie was the most unnecessary and useless character. What was his purpose in the movie? To be a little bisch? And he was a 31 year old playing a high school student. Seriously he was born in 1987.James McAvoy, bravo. I have never laughed so hard in my life. What did he have? 43 split personalities? Was one Bipsy Hussle? I wonder if he just simply closed his eyes, if he could get past the lights that trigger his split personalities.M. Night Schlong appeared in his own movie.Apparently when there's a homoerotic bum fight going down between two mental patients, the protocol is that police arrive in riot gear and shields and are completely useless instead of actually acting like police and gaining control of a situation.Samuel L.

518,lythis-love,Intense at First,6,26 January 2019,"I just learned minutes before watching the movie that there where two other movies beforehand! I was interested in the movie , as I work in Psychiatric Hospital on a closed ward for myself.
The movie began very intense and the Actor James McAvoy started on different personalites, which he did quite good. Through the movie he was the most interesting character and carried the story. Bruce Willis was Shown next with his superpowers. I found him quite weak in performance. He also did not have a lot of screen time as the others, so maybe he didn't had the chance to fully develop and show his character.
Anyway they all seem to get caught by a psychiatrist and get carried to a psychiatric hospital for some testing. I felt it was a bit far fetched for the Willis character to get into isolation cell in psychiatric hospital for what he has shown in the movie yet. Also as supposed superkillers they just come quiet and are not yet behind double bars anyway? Well, good thing the red haired Lady was there and installed some Million dollar equipment in an old brickstone, horror-movie like hospital. As she mentiones.. she only got 3 days to test them. I mean who gave her the right to take them in custody?
Anyway:
It took me then quite a while to understand who this girl from high school was, wanting to visit Kevin: first no, you can't possible visit him, you're the victim! giving her the psycho talk and sound rational. Then they even hug and cuddle. Couldn't understand about security in this house either.
I hated it all the way through the movie how the displayed the role of nurses: stupid, possibly violent and power hungry.
My faith in nurses got restored at the end end, when the nurses called security as they saw Mr. Glass leave.
Again a movie where there is no place for modern psychiatric work. But, I will leave it with that. Although let me tell about this personal split stuff:
Having multiple personalities is a mental health illness which occours on one in a Million. It's so rare that there are probably more films about it then actual noted cases. Having more personalities give you a chance to distract you from the trauma you got (mental, physical abuse, rape, etc). Switching to the main Character is not wanted, as this original person is the one with the trauma. So bringing out other characters helps to cope with the thing. Here the beast seems like Kevin's Guardian. Most important of al: the Split Characters usually don't know anything about each other, the even make a kind of amnesia when you switch. Like switching to the 9y/o but you are still in women's clothes as you just were Patricia, wondering where this oldfashioned handbag comes from. And they Switch when the Situation is needed, not when when you want to! Sure they did it here to bring more drama to the film, but also spread false information.
Anyway the girl seem to have other powers of love, which helps Kevin to keep the beast away.
While the Psychiatrist Lady, good portrayed by the way, made her psycho tests with everyone and tried to convince them they are no superheros only traumatized or special gifted Mr Glass ruled the hospital and everything seemed in his brittle hands. I liked that twisted old Mr. in the Wheelchair, bringing a good plot now and then.
The music gave a good feeling for psycho thriller and horror.
The Camera perspectives and cutting also where really powerful! 10 stars for that.
The second half of the movie was about breaking out and getting into a kind showdown between the three patients. I wished for a bit more than the parking lot, everything just seemed to be about the beast and his strength. I wanted a bit more. Willis gave a bit of a pathetic impression with his raincoat.
Then the Ending.
everyone died: beast got shot, Mister Glass.. well just fell of his wheelchair and Willis got drowned by one men in a pot hole. Dear me, those were some superhero's!
People with a clover tattoo on the wrist discussing about eliminating THEM .. End.
Mhm.. I don't know. Felt unfinished, needed an explanation.
I like the characters, storyline was sometimes boring, lots of talking but a superhero movie with only a few injured and only one got Shot! Amazing.
I would recommend it, but maybe it really needs the movies in before to understand more.",Glass

520,shalabodov-32997,The conclusion to the East Rail 177 trilogy,8,21 January 2019,"I have waited for this movie for 2 years, ever since the ending of Split and to say that I wasn't excited is to say nothing. This was my most anticipated movie in quite some time, Unbreakable happens to be one of my favorite movies of all time and Split was great. I obviously wished this to be a 10 out of 10, best movie in a while, and that's not what I got. Knowing M. Night Shyamalan, I should've known he was going to create yet another divisive film that clearly represents his vision but turns out to be extremely controversial. After the critics watched the movie, the reviews were abysmally poor and I was discouraged. What seemed to be a perfect conclusion to the trilogy was turned into a pile of steaming garbage. Or so the critics made it seem. I went in the movie with my expectations still enourmosly high, but kept in check and I was blown away by the first hour and forty minutes. It was some of the best scenery from Shyamalan ever, a few incredibly inspiring sequences, fascinatingly interesting questions raised about the heroes, and tons of character study. Where people may have found boredom, I've discovered compelling character arcs being developed. Where people may find poor pacing, I found an almost perfect mix of Split and Unbreakable.The ending is where my rating drops from a 10 to an 8. This is where Shyamalan starts to subdue your expectations and shock you by the choices he made for the finale of the film.
Truth be told, I don't agree with it. It seems rushed and one of the characters' arc closure was vastly disappointing. Yet you can't help it but respect Shyamalan for putting his vision out there and continue to create original stories without influence from others. It's definitely a blu ray buy from me, I'm so glad that I get to still defend Shyamalan!",Glass
521,austinfromdahood,What a disappointment :(,6,19 January 2019,"Glass is probably my most anticipated movie of all time. Ever since I watched Split, then Unbreakable, I've been waiting for this movie for more than a year. Last night I watched it with my cousin, and I was pumped out of my mind. I'm very sad to say that Glass isn't a great movie. It's barely a good movie, in fact. I was very disappointed leaving the theatre, because my most anticipated movie of all time was not good.Let's start with the good things about this movie. James Mcavoy, Samuel L. Jackson, and Bruce Willis were all magnificent in this movie. Bruce Willis surprisingly tried in this movie, unlike his previous projects where it looked like he was waiting for his paycheck. I won't spoil the movie, but most of the plot was interesting. There were many ideas thrown out that were intriguing, and some were not, but I'll save that for later. The score is dazzling, the cinematography is mostly stunning. There were some camera angles that were irritating, but I'll also save that for later. James Mcavoy was hilarious and amazing at the same time, playing 24 different personalities. The action sequences were awesome, and I was wondered for a while what the action sequences would be like in this movie. Unbreakable had one short action sequence and Split had no action at all. This movie had numerous action sequences, and most of them were great.Now let's talk about the negatives, and I want to start off with my biggest issue I have with the movie, and that is almost the whole third act. The only redeeming factors of the third act is some of the acting and some cool action/suspenseful sequences. That's it, and the rest of the third act had weird decisions from characters, an awkward scene that felt out of place, and a whole lot of Shyamalan cliches that many people make fun of. The Shyamalan cliches are in pretty much in all of his movies, and sometimes they are used in a good way, or in a bad way. Glass used it in a bad way, and it did not feel fulfilling. The ending itself, to me, was very disappointing. A good amount of people actually like the ending, and a google tag on this movie was ""great ending"". I could see how people like it, but I wasn't a big fan of it. The ending just made me sigh really loudly because after all the hype and waiting, this was the ending we got. It was very disappointing for me because after 19 years in the making, the Unbreakable trilogy ended in a pretty lame way. I don't know how this ending got picked, my cousin and I thought of better endings for the movie and we wished those endings were picked for the movie.Sarah Paulson's character is that one character that give a lot of exposition to the audience. She wasn't a good character in my opinion because she was only there to give exposition to the audience, and it wasn't even subtle exposition. It felt forced, like ""hey listen to what I have to say because it's important!"" The camera angles in some scenes were frustrating because there were shots that were right in a character's face, and it annoyed me. The second act also dragged for a good amount of time because it's mostly Sarah Paulson's character just giving information to the audience. I'm really disappointed by this movie, what a bummer. I'd give Glass a 6/10",Glass
522,MsClashKingYT,Movie Review By MsClashKing YT,7,25 April 2019,Glass is a really smart movie with some really interesting characters . The acting is really good and with a really small budget the movie is really good. The ending is confusing and is the worst part of the movie but it doesn't ruin the rest of the movie . The action is surprisingly great. 8.5/10 A-,Glass

524,screenotes,How do comic books work?,6,6 February 2019,"What happens when a criminal mastermind, an indestructible hero and a man with 24 distinct personalities are captured and locked in a facility together? What happens when the director who gave us 'The Sixth Sense' is on the verge of his own cinematic universe?The answer to both questions is very little. Glass is largely a talkfest of 'on the nose' dialogue which effectively comes to serve as blunt narration of how comicbooks work. It's patronising. In the end, Samuel L Jackson could just as well be auditioning to be the next Morgan Freeman.M. Night Shyamalan is striving to subvert the superhero genre which is a feat he managed with Unbreakable. Yet with Glass as with Split, the only redeeming spectacle is James McAvoy's turn as 'The Horde'. M. Night has once again proven that while he may not be the master of subverting expectations, he is certainly a master of lowering them.",Glass

526,PhatManBad,What Did I Just Watch?,5,9 June 2021,"How much did this movie cost? I'm asking because most this superhero (?) movie took place in a building and it felt like there were only seven people in this universe.I liked the premise though. Superhero (?) characters from previous M. Night Shyamalan movies trapped in an asylum sounds interesting (even though I've never seen an entire M. Night movie.). But most of the movie was just a few people sitting around and talking.Also, there's something...off about both the acting and the dialogue. Everyone acts like a weird clone of the person they're supposed to be. That's because the movie is a mix of conversations that normal people wouldn't have (like the bizarre conversation about vitamins between two of the asylum employees) and the lack of life in almost every actor's performance. James McAvoy's performance was off-putting (that's not his fault really. Actors who play characters with multiple personalities always look awkward to me), but you can tell that he's working hard.The ""origin story"" ending was confusing, bizarre, and anticlimactic. Maybe it was done that way on purpose, but it was still disappointing. When Mr. Glass revealed his master plan at the end, I was more confused than impressed.I wasn't expecting a big budget Spider-Man movie with Spider-Man and some villain knocking each other around while hundreds of extras watch instead of running for their lives.But I wish this movie had more spice.",Glass

The whole thing was ridiculous. And boring.",Glass

The disc has amazing video and audio quality, with superb bass, well-prioritized dialogue, and excellent surround sound, making the home experience feel as if I was watching the movie in a cinema. I am highly impressed.Glass has excellent performances and great dialogue. By the end of the film, I felt that M. Night Shyamalan made a movie with great moral values, about people believing in themselves and discovering what makes them extraordinary. It's a little rare to find movies like this anymore.If you enjoy superhero movies or are a fan of comic books in general, I think you'll enjoy the film, especially if you've seen and appreciated the previous films - Unbreakable and Split. I'm happy to have this movie in my collection and I highly recommend it.",Glass
537,robrooke-175-17924,Comic Books are teal after all....,7,21 January 2019,Glass 7/10 a great way to end the trilogy. Basically comic books are real?!? FACT!! Well worth a watch McEvoy again was unbelievable what a talent but he'll never get nominated for it. I'm a bit confused why the wanky critics give it such a bad name? Probably because it's not about a president or a queen.,Glass
538,jadongarcia,"Almost perfect, and like every Shyamalan Film it shattered expectations",9,23 January 2019,"The acting by James McAvoy is superior to the majority of other roles played by actors and/or actresses, McAvoy truly deserves tons of recognition for playing multiple characters so well. I wish I could say that I had a favorite personality out of all the ones he has displayed on screen, but each one he has portrayed is equally perfect to one another. Samuel L. Jackson's role in the film is very prestigious as well because of the mastermind he plays and everything his character achieves. However, the twist in the end was quite unexpected for the most part, however I did like it although its not the ending everyone was hoping for. The only thing that prevents this film from being infallible is the fact that Bruce Willis' character ""David Dunn"" gets sidelined throughout the movie, he barely even has an arc, and most people, including me, had some expectations for his character but unfortunately, he was not as sufficient of a character as I thought he would be. The film just doesn't utilize him as it should've, however, since the movie ended a certain way, I guess I can see why he didn't get much of a story to be told by the writer/director. I do recommend this film to others, its just not a film everyone is going to find 'Great'. The critics are too hard on this film again of course and especially rotten tomatoes since they used Chris Stuckman's review and tossed into the I guess you can say ""rotten review"" pile, because he wasn't sure about the film until he viewed it a second time. However its a great film and I also recommend watching Chris Stuckman's Review on this film on Youtube, my take on the film was similar to his.",Glass
539,Yee_Reviews,"Underrated by the Critics, but Too Talky & a Little Bit Messy",7,17 January 2019,"Good: The acting across the board from the main cast: James McAvoy, Samuel L. Jackson, and Bruce Willis are great. However, like in ""Split"" McAvoy is definitely the standout portraying so many personalities one after the other is fascinating to watch. Although the setup is great and intriguing, it feels glossed over to get to the main plot. Shyamalan's direction with camera angles and shots also standout and help capture the scenes along with the color scheme as seen in the other movies. I appreciate the overall theme of the movie and the message Shymalan is trying to tell, but suffers in the end and pacing...Bad: As a film that started off with ""Unbreakable"" and supposed to be the long awaited sequel to it, Bruce Willis' character does not have much depth and is more on the sidelines. There is a lot of talking and some parts definitely drag making the film feel longer than it actually is, however even with this not much seems to develop and happen.Overall: The film is getting bashed way too hard by the critics, but overrated by the audience. The film's tone is more like ""Unbreakable"" than ""Split"" with more talking and a few action scenes here and there.3.5/5",Glass
540,ahsawesa,A Flawed But Heartfelt End To The Eastrail 177 Trilogy,6,24 January 2019,"Was the wait worth it? Everyone has a different opinion but for me personally?Long answer short, yes it was. But I would like to give the long answer too because that's why I'm here.Glass is the final chapter in East Rail 177 trilogy (preceded by Split and Unbreakable) and it's about Elijah Price, David Dunn and Kevin Crumb being held in a mental institution where a doctor is trying to convince them that they are not like comic book characters with superhuman abilities.This film has received mostly mixed and negatives reviews and that baffles me because the technical mastery alone, put on display by M Night and especially his cinematographer Mike Gioulakis had me in awe. The use of color, the shot composition, the choice of shots alone just take this film to a level above mediocre. M. Night knows how to tell a story on screen. I felt like I was watching a comic book in film format. I was just sad that I'll never witness this gorgeous film again on a big screen. You do not get this kind of cinematography in most comic book movies so I appreciated it.Whenever Beast and David Dunn threw down, it was awesome. You felt the weight of their powers and M Night beautifully highlighted that with the impact each blow made whenever it happened. No clean punches and dramatic wrestling moves, no beams or lasers, just two individuals with raw strength and brute force going toe to toe.But this isn't an action film. It is very much like Unbreakable in terms of how it behaves. It takes it's time and even when it gets going, it's a slow burn that raises questions. It creates doubt and makes you rethink what you have seen over the previous few films in this trilogy. It explores the mindset of it's characters and messes with your head as it messes with theirs.What I loved was M Night treated a lot of it with patience and respect. He knows the concept of set up and pay off. Also, there's plenty of suspenseful scenes and that's expected because M Night has mastered those over his career. He also makes you wait instead of just giving you what you want right off the bat and I guess that worked because it kept me in anticipation.There was plenty of fan service just for the sake of getting a pop from the fans of the franchise but it never felt distracting. But one of the things that held this film back was that it was asking the same questions Unbreakable did, exploring the themes of delusion and purpose. I really hoped it would have been about something different and fresh but it wasnt. Thus it wasn't groundbreaking like Unbreakable which was way ahead of it's time. Glass feels like we have been here before but never like this because it does add a new spin on a superhero story by putting them in an asylum which is different from just another Marvel or DC film.I can see where some of the negativity is coming from. It has some small plot holes which is strange because this film presents itself as the most smart and grounded superhero film. The dialogue can be a bit too simple and downright childish at times. It preaches a lot and over explains plot points. The delivery of certain lines was also weak in certain scenes and at times some actors over acted or might I say under acted. Sam L Jackson was also out of character in a lot of it which was disappointing considering how he was so into the character in UnbreakableJames McAvoy gave it all to his role. That man is national treasure. He added so much heart in this film. It wouldn't be the same without him. He also has the best character arc in the film and a lot of the emotional punch of this film came from him. Bruce Willis contributed to that too. 😍Speaking of heart, I understand that this was a passion project for M Night and it shows. He really did try to do something special and while he didn't make the same impact he did with last two films of this trilogy, he did a decent job because this was a difficult film to make. The concept of a third part was juicy but if you really thought about it, where could this franchise have gone after Split? I'm not gonna criticize the places it went too much because I understand the burden of making such a risky film. I understand certain safe choices he made for certain plot elements. Some things may have underwhelmed me but I did enjoy most of it.People have been saying things about the third act of this film and how it broke the film with questionable choices. Well, it did do things that didn't need to happen and it brought back stuff that was obvious but it made sense with the ending it was going for and was it the best ending it could have had? Maybe not but it gave me closure and that's what I was looking for in the final entry of this series. It was heart felt and it got me emotional so I'd say it did it's job, I mean I teared up at one moment so there's that.Even though I saw the ending coming, there are plenty of twists and even mini surprises in the film and while they may not be as shocking as the twists from some of his other films, they are okay.I liked the message of the film even though it was a little cliched. M Night speaks about representation and the place of comic book culture and superhero mythology in the modern world through this film. It also had a lot of silly moments of self awareness regarding superhero movies and moments where it needed to be serious but wasn't but it did take it's message seriously where it needed to.Final Rating: 6.8/10. This was hard to rate but my rating of previous entries helped my hand. I had given Split a 7.0 and Unbreakable an 8.0. Most of good films I watch end up in range of 7 or above. So 6.8 seemed adequate for Glass.I found myself invested for most of it. It kept me intrigued about where it was going. I was really happy to see these characters back especially David Dunn and his son's character. And while I didn't quite love the place it ended up in, I didn't hate it either. It was just satisfactory.By no means is it a bad film. I feel like anything that diverts from the Marvel formula these days is received with extreme reactions from critics because MCU has created this framework for superhero films that critics feel like every film that is about superheroes must follow. I'm not gonna say critics are wrong hurr Durr but I would say I disagree with them here.It may have had a relatively weaker script compared to previous two entries, and it had moments where the quality dipped down, but it was too well made to be considered a bad or a mediocre film.If you were waiting for this movie, definitely go see it. Trust me, do not miss this just because it has a low rotten tomato score. Im so glad I didn't. 😀",Glass

550,salmon62,Failed screenplay and plot execution.,2,14 July 2019,"I love the M. Night franchise with the usual exceptions. This was a complete failure in terms of building up to some sort of meaningful reveal. It was a wasted Oscar-worthy performance by Mr. Mcavoy, and in the end it turns out that the whole thing was about an attempt to show that there are superheroes everywhere walking among us and that perhaps anyone can overcome their tragedies or disabilities and rise up. But this is not the vehicle for that idea.
The story itself has comic book characters, but the supporting stories are poorly represented.
The state hospital where the three superheroes are kept is possibly the worst staffed high security facility ever represented on film!
A psychiatrist is visiting for three days to evaluate the trio, but nobody bothers to Google her or ask her to wear a name tag? Psychiatric cells for high risk patients have no windows on them requiring the skeleton crew staff to walk blindly into a cell? An elaborate secret organization that can form its own police force and prevent the outside world and media from scrutiny? Not to mention there's no medical staff except nursing assistants at this sprawling state hospital!
We're asked to believe the fantastic, but the little details of everyday life don't seem practical!
And that is what makes the other elements of the story so hard to get on board with . . .
M. Night needs to pay more attention to the basic plot lines before asking us to believe the fantastic.
This time his plot twists have no real impact because he fails to have a screenplay that convinces us to care.
I didn't feel connected to the actors at all. Mcavoy's character is a serial killer. Mr. Glass a mass murderer. Bruce Willis a good guy but lacking expression or nuance.",Glass

I hate superhero films and I'm not a big action movie fan, I like dialogue heavy films with thought provoking concepts, which this tried to be. Unfortunately I found the final result quite boring, superhero's with mild superpowers, rooted in the real world, just aren't interesting. Having them finally face off in a ""fight"" that shows how little ""superpower"" they have is just dull. Having a final twist involving a secret service that tracks these lacklustre superhero's down to try and either convince them that they aren't super or liquidate them if their boring psychology talks fail is just a rubbish idea.

553,vinylvanilla,The underwhelming closure of what could have been a brilliant trilogy,6,27 January 2019,"I can describe Glass as an entertaining experience, but not solid enough to be an appropriate closure of the Unbreakable-Split-Glass trilogy.While I can see what Mr Shyamalan wanted to do, I don't think he managed to deliver with the characters and the plot the necessary complexity to answer all the questions the audience raised in the previous two movies. Many things have been left unanswered especially about Kevin, while David Dunn is just a shadow that doesn't do much in the movie.The real star in this movie is supposed to be Mr Glass, but not much about his past is told, either. Everything is absurdly summarized in a way that, in the end, we don't really know - or care - about who Mr Glass or Kevin were. There isn't enough character development or closure going on here.Sarah Paulson's talent was wasted on a character who could be played by anyone. She is a brilliant actress but the character was poorly written and brings nothing new or dramatically useful to the plot.Cinematography is fine just as the pacing of the movie. Like I said, it is entertaining, definitely - and perhaps it will please the audiences who are used to the almost shallow plots of superhero movies. But if you were expecting a more deep and challenging story about humans with supernatural powers, you will be disappointed.In the end, Mr Shyamalan couldn't make a superhero movie, and couldn't make a deep, mind-bending metaphysical movie either. He merely brushed over both worlds, but didn't dive deeply into either of them. It is a pity that a plot that had potential and that showed up to be brilliant in ""Split"" had such an underwhelming and unremarkable closure.",Glass

This movie was exactly what I was waiting for from this director. It was disturbing, one of the best acted pieces I have seen in years. (I'm looking at you James McAvoy) And when it concluded as being a sequel to unbreakable, it just blew my mind. This was genius at his best. But Shyamalan being himself destroyed it's own genius (yet again) with a unfulfilled conclusion not worthy to the story that could have been told.

The action is also exciting when it is happening. The camera work is something that is spectacular to look at. The POV shots are immersive and there are some creative uses of color throughout. The first half was interesting and engaging which was good but then you get to the rest of the film.The second half makes this movie end with a sense of betrayal as the entire buildup of the last 2 movies and the first half are ruined. The ending wastes a lot of potential that these movies have set up and trades it in for a conventional message to the viewers. Some of the scenes are laughable but not in the right way.Overall, this movie was ok. It had some great moments but the ending ruins it.

A society whose goal was to eliminate both hero and villain alike. Meh.In addition, I found the supernatural elements of the prime characters more convincing than Anya Taylor-Joy's character... someone who managed to barely survive the murderous Beast persona, yet is now somehow sympathetic to him beyond reason. IMHO, it seemed forced because Shyamalan needed to make a surprising ""triangle connection"" or link of the secondary cast members at the end of the film. Meh.Finally... I'm just gonna say it...

Was there actually a script to this garbage?I really enjoyed Unbreakable and Split, but knowing how this ends in Glass I'm not going to watch any of them again. This dire conclusion really does leave a bitter taste and is a rubbish attempt at M. NIGHT Shylaman trying to be clever. I have never known a director be so hit and miss ever!!The character endings is just so silly and lacking in originality, the character arcs were non existent and why was the lass from Split meeting the Beast?!!!! Just terrible, don't bother at all, I'm selling the trilogy as its been well and truly ruined.All the main characters die for the greater good origin story, just garbage. Lazy writing and a poor finish.",Glass

561,somersetboy,Empty Glass,4,20 January 2019,"I was engrossed in the movie and the movie felt more and more empty as it plodded along. James MacAvoy saves the movie, but again the build-up is lacking in substance and not enough to make the movie going experience complete. The whole movie is underwhenlming.Mr Shyamalan comes accross as self-indugent and full of himself. The references to comics and archetypes are superficial and not deep enough. I am assuming that Mr Shyamalan has read about Jungian archetypes, well, where is the impact in the story? All the characters, and their depth is ultimately wasted. As a viewer I felt betrayed, and my time invested in analysing the depth of characters taken for granted, and trodded upon. Lazy ending, and a shame. There is also a play on morality which is all a bit bizzare.So I cannot give it more than a 5. Bizzare and creepy camera angles and positioning is, well, just creepy and not lending itself to the storyline. It seems like it has a purpose for the first half of the movie and then it gets annoying.All the McAvoy clips should be put together into a 15 min reel and it would have bilions of views on Youtube. Other than that this movie is just rubbish.If there is another Mr Shyamalan movie, I might give it a miss. Thanks for reading.",Glass
562,Watcher42,An interesting premise spoiled by a mediocre story,6,7 April 2019,"There's nothing in Glass to convince me that M. Night has had some sort of well developed overarching narrative to tell us since he released Unbreakable in 2000. This feels far more like an attempt to jump on the bandwagon and take advantage of the current trend for 'cinematic universes' from DC and Marvel.It's a shame, as Glass does have an incredibly interesting idea at its centre, and with better story telling, or maybe another film in between Split and this one it might have been able to pull it off.The acting across the board is great. McAvoy in particular does a brilliant job; but the story moves at a glacial pace. This would be fine if it was more interesting, but after a promising opening, the middle felt flabby and repetitive and the ending fell flat. Feeling more like an intro for a new series of Heroes rather than a tantalising 'origin' for future films or something for the viewer to ponder on.With few exceptions I always seem to come away from an M. Night film feeling disappointed or unsatisfied. But I also always have hope that his next film is 'the one' to reignite my interest in him as a film maker. His ideas are compelling and perhaps he needs to collaborate with someone who can give his work a more critical pass before it moves to production.Overall Glass is not a bad film, it's just not that interesting and misses an opportunity to really explore the subject matter.",Glass

565,scott_dunning,Unless there is a 4th film........,4,22 January 2019,"I was really looking forward to watching Glass being a fan of both Unbreakable and Split as well as other movies by Shymalan such as Lady in the Water and The Village. Glass however let me down big time. The story itself was good as was the acting with the exception of James McAvoy who was fantastic. The ending though, i thought, was garbage. Throwing a twist into a movie is ok but it has to make sense and there needs to be a reason or in this case back story. It's like there should've been a movie centred around the secret society to explain who they are and why they do what they do but all we got was a 60 second mini explanation for what turned out to be the most integral part of the movie??? The ""big"" battle scene between David and the Beast was weak at best.
I did really appreciate bringing back actors to reprise their roles from both Unbreakable and Split although it was a shame Robin Wright Penn didn't return.
I think overall i enjoyed the idea of the movie way more than the movie itself and feel it fell well short of being remarkable. Maybe they cut the crap out of it and we'll get the explanations we need from an extended cut? Maybe.
Cheers :-)",Glass
566,somlaign1,Disappointing.,4,26 January 2019,"Nowhere near as good and credible as Unbreakable and Split. The story only took place at this psychiatric facility, very underwhelming. Nothing climactic. I find it very implausible that the 3 main characters are known to have superhuman abilities and are a danger to the public but yet there are virtually only 2 nurses on duty (actually 1 per shift) and no high security measures or guards. The premise was good, just not executed in a credible manner. Especially when it's later revealed that the doctor (woman in charge) knew all along that they are real, so even more questionable as to why the lack of security.Also, how did Mr. Glass break out of his cell at night, needed to see more ingenuity at work here. There are definitely some lazy writing that can't pass unnoticed but otherwise, watchable.",Glass

The acting is over the top with the split personality character & the head doctor, but Morgan Freeman's acting is great and really carries the movie.The plot is utterly nonsensical and suffers from M. Night Shyamalan's signature issues with having characters make exaggerated soliloquies. Trying to tie together the two movies (Unbreakable and Split), the movie fails at creating a coherent plot.",Glass
571,MovieBuff_sl,Not my cup of tea,4,27 January 2019,"Before anyone shoots me, the reason I rated this below average is that I did not see Unbreakable and if you have neither watched this nor Split, then you will be lost. I loved Split though. Sequels should be able to stand on its own coz if it doesn't then those who have not watch the prequels would not know the backdrop. Kudos to James McAvoy with his multiple split personalities and how fast he switches amongst them. Awesome...if not for that, it would have been a waster of money",Glass
572,redcanofevil,The Glass is 3/4th full,8,18 January 2019,"Glass although suffers from an insipid script and few weird POV shots, still manages to keep afloat and cement itself as a worthy entry to the Shamala-verse. The sluggish pacing and questionable routes taken throughout the film may be a turn-off to some but surprisingly bodes well with the anti-climactic premise of this and the two before it. An overall delightful performance from the entire cast, with break out performance by James McAvoy as we get to see all 24 of his personalities.

Maybe they were expecting big clashes with lots of special effects, like avengers or spiderman 3 or something like that? I don't know.I'm truly sorry for those who couldn't experience this trilogy as I did. When Unbreakable came out, nobody I knew liked it, and I LOVED IT. Everyone was disappointed because they were expecting ""Six Sense 2"". So apparently this ""genre?"" (shyamalan-superheroes) is not for everyone. If it's not for you, it's just not for you, don't push it.It has the same ""subtle""? ""minimalistic""? superhero approach as Unbreakable and Split, even there are moments in the movie when you don't know if it's real or not, if it's all a delusion or something is really happening.I won't say ""watch it now"", since it's not for everyone, for me it was 10/10.",Glass

Glass is achievement in Film Making like I have never seen before.M night's mind is truly gifted when he makes films, and this Film is just the icing on the Cake. It was mind blowing, Epic, Thrilling, Terrifyingly perfection, Masterpiece with Score and music that blows your mind.I really dont understand some of the negative reviews on this film. I find these people so uninformed and not open minded to understand how brilliantly made this film is. It is just a shining star of film Making.I am so so happy that Bruce Willis character 's son joined them ,and Samuel L Jackson character mother joined them ,and the girl from split. They make a great ensemble for the film. It made it more powerful and more stronger for audiences when all these forces of incredible actors come together.Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson Perfirmance is incredible in so many ways. The outstanding performance was James Mackavoy he deserves an oscar nomination for this film because his acting is beyond what anyone can think. He performed his role so brilliantly it will scare you, make you feel sorry for him and makes you angry at him. He brought out all 23 characters and his versatile acting is too good not to see, he is so gifted and talented. He should be doing Horror too.The story is very Tense in this 3rd film and the ending will blow your mind.Brief explanation of the film. 3 humans with powers are joint together but are they super humans or just delusional and crazy?Glass is Truly unique and stands alone to be a Masterpiece alongside Films such as: Signs, The God Father, The Departed, The Sixth Sense, The Sound of Music, Lawrence of Arabia, Titanic, Terminator 2 Judgment Day, Misery, Silence of the Lamb.Glass is and will always be a great film to see.

581,lawrencestevens-58369,Somewhat torn on this movie,6,21 January 2019,"First off I really enjoyed both unbreakable and split and was looking forward to this. I was left kind of disappointed with this. Not that it's bad or anything. I really enjoyed the first half of this film but the second became a mish mash and it lost its footing I think and the ending being a bit stupid and the wrapping up at the end a bit tedious. This film is kind of somewhat separated into 3 different segments. The first 1/3 of the movie seems very focused on David Dunn, the second on Kevin and the third on glass. It was more of a split sequel more than an unbreakable one, Kevin/the beast is the main focus I feel with James mcavoy stealing the show again with the characters, Sam l Jackson and Bruce Willis were nothing that notable tbh. David's son is back and is the best suppurting character for me. I have problems with incompetent characters who are either crap at their job or just stand around doing nothing especially in the third act when for some reason they just stand there doing nothing, then do something, then disappearing and doing nothing again. It was just off to me and felt completely unnatural and disjointed. It's shot quite well as well with nice cinematography. I do recommend watching this, not because it's an amazing film or whatever but more so as closure to the other 2 films and to finish off the trilogy. If you liked split and want more then you'll like It I think. But you may be disappointed and notice the drop off in then second half",Glass
582,cmayerle-41064,So hard to rate....,8,27 January 2019,"I loved the ending, but overall I just liked the movie, which makes it incredibly hard to give a star-rating. I settled on 8 because of how well it combines the other two movies of the trilogy without compromising either story.So, what's not to like? As in Unbreakable, Shyamalan has the characters explain the comic book genre and how it is playing out within the movie itself, but he does it way too much, giving the audience little credit for being able to figure things out for themselves. At times, it really seems forced rather than a natural part of the dialect.Also, if you're looking for wall-to-wall action, this movie is not for you. It's more like Shyamala's other movies that are more about building up to the reveal than inundating you with action. That is a positive in my book, but it's not for everybody.However, Shyamala is back with clever plot twists that he advertises without the audience quite picking them up. For the first three-quarters of the movie, I thought, ""Well, this is a bit farfetched,"" only to have a perfect explanation of that in the last 20 minutes or so.All of the actors really performed well except Shyamala in his brief scene (his acting was pretty awful) and Jackson in a couple of later scenes. So, this is definitely a movie worth seeing to the end and hopefully it marks a comeback for Shyamala after his less than stellar efforts that nearly killed his whole career.",Glass
583,lf_macias,A nostalgic and enyojable conclusion to an unexpected trilogy,8,26 January 2019,"After a period of 19 years in which the director and screenwriter M. Night Shyamalan built this trilogy unexpectedly, we finally have the conclusion of the story of David Dunn and Elijah Glass (from the movie Unbreakable) now united by The Horde (from the movie Split).
The film starts in the current era and we know the fate of these 3 characters and how they live in their status as superheroes and villains that had been presented in previous films.
From there the story begins to walk along a convoluted path that will only make sense towards the final stretch, but which is still enjoyable. Shyamalan knows how to build a huge approach to history, which for those unfamiliar with the previous films may seem tedious, but pays with an exciting final third exciting full of twists and revelations quite satisfactory and consistent with the world that history presents.
It is a film that is more enjoyable for fans of both Unbreakable and Split as well because we see the main characters of those movies returning but others supporting characters too and thet gain relevance as the film progresses, which increases the emotionality. Cherry on the cake is Shyamalan's cameo, which personally touched me a lot.
The three actors comply; James Mcavoy had already shown us his talent by playing more than 10 characters and here he does it again and even more; Samuel L. Jackson perfectly fulfills that line between villain and madman; and Bruce Willis looks comfortable and happy to return to this character.
In conclusion, I enjoyed the movie a lot, it exceeded my expectations and I do not understand the hatred of the critics against it.",Glass
584,joseph-boik,"Superb acting, but with an underwhelming twist ending.",8,19 May 2019,"The twist ending wraps up the trilogy, but in a manner that seemed mostly to nail the universe shut so that no other films can exist here: by killing every super. It was only somewhat rectified by the second twist: Glass' master plan to reveal that supers exist to the world that resembles today where the internet and viral videos can be used to leak the truth. However, it still leaves doubt in that an organization that works in the shadows to keep the world blind to supers couldn't find a way to pull the necessary strings to ""disprove"" the leak as nothing more than a fancy special fx film.All in all, I feel Shyamalan could've done more with the ending to get a similar ending, but with a more satisfying feeling.",Glass
585,elliomartinez,The Horde,7,30 December 2020,"The only thing that kept me watching this movie was James McAvoy! His character (or should I say characters?) is the most interesting of the whole story. The director made sure to display James' abilities front and center. I was impressed by how fast he was able to switch from one personality to another and how believable it was! I started to root for him and I was even very sad when he died.The movie itself was disappointing. I had more questions than answers when it was over. The twists were interesting but not enough. I believe the secret society needs their own origin story, because I felt like they came out of nowhere.Bruce Willies is also such a bad actor for this type of movies.

586,Joetampa90,M Night Shyamalan Drops the Ball,5,22 January 2019,"Glass, where do I begin? Unbreakable was fresh and well written. Split was offbeat and fun. Glass is dull and forced. You may think Glass is going to be an epic action packed show down between good and evil, but in reality its more of an over the top character drama. The action is few and far between, but the yawns are a plenty.
Willis mails his performance in, as he has been for the better part of 2 decades. Jackson does his thing fine. McAvoy picks up where he left off in Split with the same strong performances.
One main issue here is the execution of putting all the pieces together. It never feels epic, it never drops your jaw, its just kind of like ""here you go"".
M Night wanted something epic and you can tell, but it really just does not work. The end feels forced, silly and frankly absolutely atrocious. There is honestly no one I'd recommend this movie to, as the guy I went with is a huge fan of the first two and did not enjoy Glass at all.

Night Shyamalan movies are not known for action, and a person who goes in expecting a standard superhero film will be disappointed. I expected plot twists and actively tried to guess what they would be. The movie satisfied. In classic Hitchcock style, it kept the intensity while showing very little onscreen action, and the plot twists remained unpredictable. James McAvoy's performance was brilliant. While not the ending I expected, it was a fitting end to the trilogy. It's nice to watch a film that does not rely on effects and action while sacrificing story and character development.",Glass

1) The commercials you see for a movie, the chances are that movie is going to be terrible.
2) If the critics are unanimously bashing a movie, chances are that movie is actually good.I don't even know where to start with this movie. The acting, cinematography, directing...it was all magnificent. The first time I saw James McAvoy star in a movie was Wanted followed by Xmen. I always thought he was just an average actor as he didn't really wow me with any of his performances...until Split.The first time I watched Split, I could not believe what an amazing job McAvoy did playing 24 different characters. It wasn't just that he acted slightly different when portraying these characters, but you truly believed that he was all of those characters. In fact, you could know what character he was at any given time just based on facial expressions and body language.Now fast forward to Glass...to this day, I have never seen a better acting performance than the one McAvoy's put forward in this film. The way he played The Beast was unbelievable, you felt the evil running throughout his body...he was truly scary.I could go on for days talking about the other actors, the script, directing, etc...but thought I would just talk about McAvoy's performance as that is what stood out to me the most. I hope this post doesn't get lost in the sea of fake/paid comments, which this website has become so accustomed to, as I really hope people go see this movie.Final takeaway: Don't wait, go see this movie in theatres.

But! If the whole story and the first 2 movies are really something comic-like I have no words. Because, everything what I saw here in Glass would be perfect in a comic book. No one would say, man that's are not okay, 'cause nobody really cares stuffs like these in comic books. Its logical or not, could this happend or not...
Glass has a really strange, but cool mood, 3 perfect actors (especially and finally Bruce Willis again), amazing camera work and great music.
Maybe not the best way how Shyamalan did his finale film in this trilogy and thats why Im a little bit angry about, but still works fine to me. 7/10",Glass

603,MJL_Uncensored,A Good Movie That Deserved to Be Great,6,26 January 2019,"I was supposed to love Glass.Why don't I love Glass?The critics hate Glass. I rarely agree with them, but for once, they were right.I loved Unbreakable--one of the most underappreciated movies of 2000. ""Split"" was groundbreaking -- a film that floored me from start to finish and ended with one of the best plot twists ever! So I was frothing at the mouth when Glass was finally complete. This movie would erase the stain of The Last Airbender and restore M. Knight Shyamalan to greatness. Chances are at the time of this post, he's probably raking in a fortune from the hype, but I like so many critics, found myself sitting in the theater with furled eyebrows and stupified look that clearly read: Is he serious?Glass picks up 19 years after Unbreakable. A weathered David Dunn (Bruce Willis) is still hunting down bad guys as a raincoat wearing vigilante. Elijah Price/Mr. Glass (Sam Jackson) is in a psych ward, and Kevin Crumb (James McAvoy) continues to terrorize young girls with one of his other 19 personalities. The movie opens with a splendid ode to vigilante justice in the vein of the Dark Knight and immediately re-establishes McAvoy's Kevin (aka the Beast) as one of the greatest on-screen villains ever.The bar for success had been set and all M. Knight Shyamalan needed to do was hop right over it.Well, not so fast, Flash.This movie first starts to go off the rails when the titular character is left offscreen for the first hour. It might as well have been called Dunn vs. Kevin. Then, when all three characters are finally on-screen together, it sets up one of the most feeble-minded plot twists in the movie. I won't spoil it, but I will say, the entire concept of superhero therapy is as hokey as it sounded in the trailer. When you finally learn Sarah Paulson's role in the film as Dr. Ellie Staple, you'll wonder why her original plan was implemented at all.But I tried to let it go because there are so many good things happening in this film. Shyamalan's POV style of action and off-screen terror--while a cliche of his cinematic style--is still useful in creating some pretty cool visuals. He keeps the camera tight on people, so sometimes it's uncomfortable, forcing you to deal with our primal issues with space, but it also builds tension in the best kind of way. So there's things here to be applauded. Visually, he is masterful in this film. It's the story that weakens this film.It's no secret that Mr. Glass teams up with The Beast/Kevin to fight Dunn. That's what we're waiting on. But the epic battle is relatively weak. Where there should be action, there's monologuing. Where there should be tension, there's a distance between the hero and villain. And where there should be logic, there is none.In the end, out of nowhere, Paulson's role is revealed, and it opens the door for a million questions about plausibility. Everything Mr. Glass has orchestrated comes into question. How did he know to plan for this? Sure, his superpower is intellilect but is he a prophet too. The Beast and Dunn are given a resolution the feels confusing considering everything they were put through. And Paulson's character presents earth-shattering plot twists that upend the credibility of the entire film as a cohesive narrative.""Glass"" is not a bad film. It's just not a great one. And it should have been. It's bound to be as polarizing as Bird Box. You'll either love it or hate it. I don't hate it. I'm just mad I couldn't walk away loving it.",Glass

605,cherry_town,Lost in the Script,2,17 January 2019,"That is kind of a film where moviegoers do not stay in their chair after the picture is over to meditate and savor an aftertaste. You rush for an exit being sorry for time and money spent as the script proved to be unsurmountable for the master of the Sixth Sense. By the middle of the movie you lose interest to what happens next. You do not care if that skyscraper would be hijacked or not. And the fact that it has eventually been not leaves you totally bored and uninterested. And yes, for folks not raised in the comics culture this movie is a double blank shot",Glass
606,registers-944-48791,Waste of good characters,2,20 February 2021,"My issue with this movie is how it changes characters from what we've seen on past movies.On Split, Kevin is an actual disturbed serial killer with original characteristics. Here he's diminished to a generic villain stereotype/caricature.Same goes for Elijah, that on Unbreakable was a mad man who believed comics are real and did terrorist actions looking for a hero. He did that not to find a match to fight him, but to help so many ppl needing for help. Now he does want a superhero to match his supervillainity, and copies Magneto's desire to have this ""hero race"" known and accepted by mankind!!Back on Split, Casey is a shy girl who is kidnapped and needs to deal with the bully of the other 2 girls and survive the kidnapper, which includes persuade his multiple personalities. Here she acts as his girlfriend! How come she like him, after he had kidnapped her, tried to kill her, and having witnessed him killing 2 girls in front of her and knowing he had done the same to many more?!Same goes for David. He was an original character who had a superpower which was unknown to him and lived the boring life of an average person, until he discovered his power, which is far from being omnious, and ended up using it as he could to help ppl. Now he's just another generic superhero who caricaturely fights the villains... just because so. There's no plausible reason for him having been locked, even more on a private institution instead of penitenciary. Even worse is the reason for killing him at the end. Even if we consider that the institution wanted him dead because he has superpower, why didn't they just do it before when they had him locked?Lastly his son. On Unbreakable we see him as part of David's struggle to deal with his broken family. I loved how he was trying to rebind with his ex while also trying a job on another city (or maybe he didn't quit the job trial for the case of failing to reunite) and then both paths collide on the worst way possible. I loved how Joseph threatened to shoot his father and they have to deal with this situation. Now he's only a superhero's butler who helps him remotely.To summarize, Glass recycles other movie's nicely developed deep characters into superficial dumb caricaturized generic superhero ones.",Glass

He should win awards for his performance. However, that didn't save the movie for me.Samuel L. Jackson and Bruce Willis didn't put on performances like they did in Unbreakable nor other movies they've been in. Honestly, while they were supposed to be just as crucial to the story as McAvoy they fell flat.The movie seemed way too slow paced at times and extremely talky which had me admittedly looking at my cell phone a couple times(I was then only one in the theater so not ashamed of that).When you finally get to the showdown between ""the overseer"" and ""the beast"" it was extremely underwhelming. I expected more and admittedly that could be because ""the beast"" was made out to be so powerful in Split.The ending, while I understood the concept, just had me going well....that was it? A secret organization with no explanation whatsoever, the fact Mr. Glass apparently knew what was going on the entire time, etc? It would be fine if there were more movies planned but this has been said to be the last one.

The addition of Sarah Paulson was great, but I needed a bit more from her character, as it felt a bit too bland. The third act showed promise but ended up disappointing as it rendered most of the second act useless, and the twists and turns simply didn't work and did not succeed in elevating the movie in any way,Overall, I enjoyed some parts of the movie, mainly the build-up in the first act and McAvoy's performance, but the movie suffers from a lack of connection and overall direction, we can't connect to the characters and that ended up damaging the end of this film.",Glass

It's slow sure but not slow as in boring .... it's suspenseful, it's disturbing, it's intelligent, it's clever. Watch ""Split"" first and this immediately after for full affect. Beautifully done kudos to M. Night Shyamalan - you are by far my favourite filmmaker of all time",Glass
622,tyelder,BROKE all expectations.,10,21 January 2019,"M. Night FREAKIN Shyamalan has completed his Unbreakable trilogy just the way he started it, blowing our minds. With Glass, Shyamalan has taken the previous two films and meshed all the characters and moments we all remember and love into this ultimate finale.
This psychological thriller doesn't take its time getting into the main plot of the film. The exposition is little and very well executed during the first act. Shyamalan knows audiences, like myself, have been waiting years for this and he does not disappoint.
The performances by all three main 'superheroes' are phenomenal. McAvoy taking the spotlight every time he is on screen-with additional personalities that weren't seen in Split. On top of the big three, the supporting cast does anything but disappoint. One surprise was how big of roles they each had, which was a bold and successful move.
The suspected Shyamalan twist ending was not expected-whatsoever. I was blown away three times, I believe. He knew that audiences would be looking for it and that it'd be a back-burning thought throughout the runtime. So, he manipulated the audience, as Night does, and had several smaller twists that seemed to be 'the one.' Yet, as soon as the thought of questioning Shyamalan's writing decisions crossed my mind, boom, another twist. All leading up to the most satisfying, and unexpected, ending that perfectly concludes the trilogy and Shyamalan's vision.
It may have received poor reviews because of harsh critics who didn't get what they wanted. But, it wasn't their movie and it wasn't mine, yet I don't see how they could be so negative. Shyamalan's vision is clearly shown on screen through the well executed detailed story he beautifully told in 129 minutes. The film was so moving, I had goosebumps and sat up on the edge of my seat during the entire third act. The movie blew my expectations out of the water and obliterated all the belittling I have heard from media.
This film is one that has summed up a perfect trio of stories and has interwoven them all into this glass-breaking beast of a movie. Well deserving of praise for years to crumb.

But still, a very impressive job mixing the different vibes from the two first movies and putting them in only one piece. But there are some issues, very clichè stuff. Like the end, well, i mean, the last 2 minutes could have been exploited better, and even some forced scenes, i mean, that stuff wasn't there in Split, nor unbreakable: it feels like rushed at times, not so much effort was put in details or maybe too evident details at sight.It's a pretty standard movie after all, not as good as the two first entries, but very solid overall, when you put everything together, you see how good it is and how well though the whole trilogy is. The end(not counting the last two minutes) was genius, if they stricked with the ""before the end"" the trilogy would've felt a little bit pointless, i mean, 20 years to get here, so i'm fine with the finale. Finishing, a more in depth execution was needed to resemble at best the first two movies quality, but it's still very good film. Definitely against the general critics mind, they failed this movies for stupid reasons, and i feel ashamed that people like that can give such an influential verdict.",Glass

One person bought into the hype right from the first trailer and the other was more like me in the sense they were curious to see how this would all end up. Both of these individuals thought the movie lagged in certain parts or was uneven in certain parts. I thought the film was exactly what I thought it would be. I think if you are familiar with Shamalyn's work and certain trademarks, this movie follows exactly how he would have ended.We all felt the ending didn't require any explanation and were confused why people wrote posts or articles on such. I'm not even sure I would consider the ending to have a twist, but I would at least say it was surprising that he made that decision.I applaud Shamalyn for financing his own work and trying to create original stories that are not reliant on special effects or a built in fanbase like the huge blockbusters we see.James McAvoy makes Samuel L Jackson and Bruce Willis look like amateurs, which in itself is surprising as they are icons in their own right.

I'm utterly shocked and disappointed with the treatment that David Dunn's character got in this movie. It is so ridiculous.The movie was awesome all the way up until the end. The movie was building its climax and in the end it just fizzled out. I have to say that the treatment of the main character and his demise was utterly disrespectful. I guess no fan service for all those who have been waiting all these years for some great fight scene. At least you could have let David completely whoop the beast's ass before he met his demise.I don't have to tell you the acting was good all the way around. like I said it was a solid movie up until the end when somebody obviously bumped their head and started writing to the left.,Glass
634,JamesMcIrish,Wow. Just awful,2,14 December 2019,"I'll admit I'm not a huge Shyamalan fan - I thought sixth sense was his one good film - but this was far worse than I was expecting.
Awful, awkward dialogue. Totally random expositions that add nothing to the story. And no twist worth talking about.
The fight-scenes, like the protagonist's super-powers, are half-baked at best. I understand this is not an action film, but since the ""psychological"" element was maudlin pop-psychology at best, and at worst just plain silliness, the action that was there needed to ""pop"". It just didn't.My feeling throughout the film was that birthers and their ilk would love its nod to conspiracy theory lore, which might explain some of the unwarranted love the film receives.
M Night fanboys (and girls) no doubt skew the overall score a lot too. Note how many comments take aim at ""the critics"", rather than just accepting their take on this movie - a classic defense mechanism against a perceived ""elite"", who's views are therefore implied to be inherently untrustworthy.The film is not engaging. The story is not engaging. The sparseness of the sets feels like budget constraints rather than an artistic choice - whether it was or not. Many of the unusual camera angles just don't work, and give this the feeling of a student film project in places.
Although McAvoy is great I just don't find the characters he's asked to play engaging or menacing (I didn't particularly enjoy Split, though at least it felt more cohesive and therefore successful as a film).Plot in a nutshell: People with vague, mild superpowers get captured and somehow convinced they might not have them. Glass, bizarrely, thinks the biggest problem he has is that the world hasn't seen video of these minor acts of strength. Glass makes a plan to release the others and kill himself in order to get the video of what they can do out (something that would have been a lot easier and less lethally accomplished had he done it at any point in his life before being captured). Everyone dies, but there's video of it on youtube. The end.Caveat: This film was so dull I zoned out a few times, but the above is basically the plot I took from it all.",Glass

Now we can get to the bottom of this trilogy. The videos sent from unanimous is an pretty good indication of what can be expected for either the end or the beginning. The battle scene of the beast (Dennis Hedwig) & the overseer (David Dunn) is living proof that what was determined a myth is true right before our eyes. John wick 3 preview looks badass. Just because. The dramatic effects mentioned by Joseph can only be the gift of m. night Shyamalan. Who keeps bringing the twists & turns we deserve as a matinee goer with the cinemark XD.
Was the scene with the beast & the overseeer in the preview where they disappear in the mist & in the movie where they fall all the way through visibly in the mist intentional? (Get @ me M.

I did not understand the hate for Bruce Willis' performance, it was everything it needed to be. Nor did I understand why this film was not universally loved. It was so well done and filled with so much story and character development, not relying on action sequences or computer generated graphics. It was just a story where you could almost believe these people could exist. The ending did go on a little long for me and it appeared there were too many twists for its own good. Finding out Kevin's dad was on the train was enough of a twist for me. It didn't hurt the film but the twist of a secret organization that has been around for thousands of years and then the twist that Jackson had been pulling the strings the entire time before getting around to sharing the footage of the superhuman feats shared across the world. At first viewing it appeared it was trying to be too clever but I have watched this film 5 times just because I loved it so much and I grew understand why it had such an extended ending. I could not believe he committed to killing off all the main characters, it was bold and unheard of in this genre. All in all, it is a must see and a great pay off of the two previous films in the franchise.",Glass
641,Wade_C,Second worst movie of 2019?,2,23 April 2020,"M. Night, Why? WHY? I didn't expect anything from this film and you still failed me!Okay, I'll stop being dramatic. What did anyone expect? It floors me that this has a 6.7 currently on IMDB, That's higher than a lot of films that are much better (IMO) like Hulk (2003), A Little Help (2010), The Happening (2009), Many more films are better than this.Yet, This trash seemingly has a lot of fans. I respect those people, I'm glad someone can actually like this film. I personally found this film to be disappointing, yet awful also. The cast is excellent per usual for this cast, Bruce Willis, Anya Taylor-Joy, Spencer Treat Clark, who is surprisingly great considering I've never heard of this actor and never seen him in a film, James Mcavoy, who is the best thing about this bad movie, How do you mess that up?Well, There is one way. Sarah Paulson. Yep, Am I supposed to talk about her? She just isn't that great. She's not bad, but due to the crappy script, It kinda ruins everything.THE SCRIPT:It feels as if M. Night felt that this film wasn't boring at all, Unfortunately, It is boring. The writing is odd and feels like a fake movie script inside a movie. Remember Scream 3? Half the movie was about a cast/crew making a movie inside a movie, It feels like that movie. This doesn't feel like an actual film, It feels, kinda fake.M. NIGHT'S POV:I'm pretty sure Night knew that people were gonna hate this film. I get it, He doesn't care what we think. However, We have brains, We have thoughts, and that's why this film doesn't work. If the whole film was as ambitious as the last two mins of the film, This film would've been excellent.THE ENDING:I'm not going to spoil the twists, They're too dumb for me to even explain. If the film would've had literally any other twist, It would've been better BUT NO. There are so many plotholes to the point where a 2/10 seems generous, but whatever.",Glass

651,michielodb,A conflicted masterpiece,7,27 January 2019,"I am probably one of the millions of people who waited years for this movie to happen. Ever since I watched Split at the theatre, I was incredibly hyped to see this movie. One of my of all-time favorite movies Unbreakable that comes together with a movie that inspired me insanely much. I went to see this movie yesterday with incredible anticipation but equal as many nerves. After seeing it...I felt conflicted.There is honestly plenty to like in this movie: all the performances are great (McAvoy steals the entire show yet again), the directing is superb, the camerawork is outstanding, the soundtrack is suspensful, the pacing is good, etc. This virtually a technically perfect movie. Some people say that the pacing is too slow but if you have seen Unbreakable, then you normally should not really care because this movie is cleary paying homage to it.You guessed it, it is the story itself where the conflicted feelings have risen, together with the characters that inhabit the story. David, Kevin and Elijah are all three excellent; the supporting characters are also good, we have returning characters from the previous movies who don't just casually appear on screen, they actually have a purpose in the movie; but then there is one new character who will annoy and possibly also anger a lot of people, myself included. The actress playing the role did a very good job, it is just that her character is pretty much the contradiction of what M. Night has been building all these years with this trilogy, and her motives just did not feel right.The main issue, the big elephant in the room, that will divide a lot of the fans, and I am certain that it is the reason this movie has gotten negative grades by some, is actually a spoiler. I will not spoil anything here so I will keep it as vague as possible. Once two of our main characters actually go into action, the movie instantly starts building up to a certain finale, you start thinking that this would be an awesome finale. However the finale that we get is totally different, but as a fan you could kind of expect that since the whole point of this trilogy is to keep it as realistic as possible (you will see that too in the fight scenes). The finale we get is good and with a couple of reveales. One reveal I really liked, the other one I totally did not. I thought the big reveal with one of the characters was a big middle finger to what the entire trilogy has been trying to build for all these years and I felt really annoyed. I must say that I also kind of expected what would happen with our main characters, except with one, the fate one specific character really upset me and is by far my main problem with this movie. However how the movie decides to end everything, and by that I mean the ending the movie, was good enough for me to accept it.In the end, this was a totally different movie than I think all of us were expecting. There are so many elements of greatness and wonder but because of that finale (a reveal of a certain character and the fate of another one), I left very conflicted and it keeps me away from saying that this movie is great.Therefore I will be giving it a 7.1/10",Glass

656,gspencley,Boring,3,17 April 2021,"A few things first: I had no idea this was the 3rd instalment in a trilogy until I read the other reviews. So I have not seen Unbreakable or Split. Also, I like a superhero movie if it puts characters and plot first. IMO the best era for superhero movies was the early 2000s (the first X-Men, Sam Raimi Spider-Man, Nolan Trilogy etc.) and I don't care for the newer Marvel or DC movies at all. I say that so that you don't dismiss my review thinking that I just want action - that's not me. I played this movie on Netflix on a bored Saturday afternoon because it looked interesting, I adore Anya Taylor-Joy after The Queen's Gambit, and you can never go wrong with Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson (or so I thought). I watched about half of it before I just couldn't take any more and turned it off.This movie was just boring. To say that it was a slow burn is an understatement. Here are my detailed critiques:I had no investment in the characters. Maybe it's because their exposition was provided in the earlier movies, but I had no reason to feel connected or like them or care about them at all.The plot is so slow moving that I just kept waiting for something, anything to happen. And it never did.Sarah Paulson plays the same character as always. I know she has a lot of accolades and people really like her. I liked her when she played Sarah Paulson in the first couple seasons of American Horror Story but I'm bored of the Sarah Paulson character now.There were no stakes. No reason to feel suspense or want to keep watching. I think this is because of my first point: I wasn't invested in the characters so I couldn't feel anything regardless of what happened to them.Maybe if I'd have seen Unbreakable and Split I could have been more invested in this movie. Although based on the other reviews it might not have done the trilogy justice anyway.",Glass

This movie is different kind of superhero movie with thought-provoking scenario.

James McAvoy plays heavenly 20 different personalities in Glass - as in Split - that proves us again how powerful his acting is. After long time, seeing Bruce Willis as David Dunn was a good surprise to remember his old good days. Anya Taylor-Joy has unique aura as an actress, I hope we see more Anya Taylor-Joy in different characters.In the beginning of the movie, M. Night Shyamalan shows his face to the audience as always.

Is it fair to dismiss the whole movie just because of the ending?I didn't like Glass, simply because it was not as good as the other two.I had mixed feelings about Unbreakable. It was odd, definitely not one of Shyamalan's better movies, but it had a decent plot and it had all my favorite actors, and it was really, really, really well shot. Shyamalan is very good at that. Split was not just good. It was spectacular, and not just because of McAvoy. Everyone in it was perfect. So many unexpected twists and turns. Story was phenomenal. I loved Split so much I couldn't wait to see Glass. And then it came out and I was really disappointed. The story was weak. Yes, it still had my favorite actors in it, but their performances were disjointed and didn't connect. Even McAvoy's hoard, by now well known, was not so as effective.My verdict, the movie was a miss.Still, I loved many Shyamalan's movies, so despite the failure of Glass, I am sure he will come up with something better.

And how many the otherwise, to let the truth be out there, release the unlimited potential everyone has?Base on the music choice, I believe this movie is standing side with the superpowers. Who are these secret society / people anyways to decide whether or not people are allowed to know the secret?It is true though that in this movie we have a balance of Mr. Glass (as an exposure mastermind), Overseer (the good guy), and the Horde (the villain).

The acting, everyone is doing fine, poor dialog isnt an actor's fault. McAvoy is delivering, as he did in Split.
The story itself is acceptable, some nifty twists, as you might expect from M. Night Shyamalan, but the writing is just poor.We have a serial kidnapper being caught (Bruce bumps into him pretty soon, the odds!) and he gets send to a mental hospital right away. Not one in a prison, no sir, just a regular(?) one, with minimum security. Even 'normal' mental hospitals would have more personell around, let alone one for criminals.
Not only is the security minimum, the guards are downright idiots. No protocols are followed (""is he really a serial kidnapper?gee let me get close unarmed"") and there's no sign of any police or justice department involved.
All the relatives seem perfectly fine with this kind of treatment too, no policereports or so, no lawyers or anything...all good.

I wanted a lot more from this movie. The only thing i liked was the recast o David dunn sun, Mr Glass mom, almost 20 years after unbreakable. And Dunn's kid is the most believable performance in the movie.
The Ending should have been the fight, Mr Glass as promised, a war in the buliding, but i thing the lack of budget stoped M. Night Shyamalan intentions.

But the ending is just totally devasting and was almost a ""(IMDb surely won't let me say the word here) you"" ending. I mean that ending was just totally ultra tragic and devastating. Especially with ..... well I don't want to spoil it all except that I can hint on that you'll probably want to blurt out in the theatre ""that's Murder"" when you see it happen. I mean that ending was more painful to watch than the Saints/Eagles regular season game this year.The first half and maybe even the first two thirds are great/fantastic. As the grand finale gets set to go it still seems really great and interesting, but they instead ...... well I know the rule...... you have to see M Night Shaloyman's films twice to understand. But I really wanted to see James Mcavoy character climb the tall building at the end and then maybe go off into 5 different personalities while Samuel L Jackson character just rolled his when he was explaining to him what to do at the top of the building.The film though at the very end is totally left open ended. It seems that's the end.....or they'll start with three new characters now",Glass

Maybe if it was just once in the beginning to set the stage for Elijah's personality.....Also, I see no reason whatsoever to have David killed at the end of the movie. He was able to be fine and walk away from all of it, and he was murdered in front of everyone there. Everyone could see him being murdered! Did Shyamalan forget this was all happening in plain daylight, in a public place? It seemed unnecessary and forced and kind of left me flat and disappointed.

695,Donnie_Quixotic,Breakable and Broken,4,28 February 2021,"Just as ""Split"" did before it, ""Glass"" is a showcase for the diverse talents of James McAvoy. It's also another reminder to me that Bruce Willis has either forgotten how to act or simply doesn't care anymore. Every role he's played in the past decade or so, he just looks perpetually bored. The brief flashbacks of him in ""Unbreakable"" were a happy reminder that he used to be one of the best actors of his generation... I mean the subtle emotions he could realistically convey were a clinic on A-class acting.Most of the supporting characters are written unconvincingly, both in pedestrian and perfunctory dialogue and contrived character motivation. I mean the doctor, hammily portrayed by Sarah Paulson, trying to make them believe they're not what they know they are by explaining away all their superhuman feats using a form of contrived logic... ""Those steel bars he bent were old... I could bend them with a crowbar,"" and whatever other BS she said... Please.The finale is bizarrely shot in an uninteresting parking-lot in broad daylight to make it look even more uninteresting... Well at least it matches the uninteresting hospital interior in which most of the movie takes place.Shyamalan should have done a few more rewrites before rushing into full scale production on this underwhelming piece of mediocrity.",Glass

699,thesupertomster,"Fine, but doesn't really need to exist",5,26 January 2019,"Better than the critics' reviews had me expecting it to be, but still nowhere near as good as Unbreakable or Split. Glass offers some entertaining interactions between the worlds of these two movies and continues many of the themes and ideas that they set up, but is unfortunately coated with a layer of pretentiousness that can be quite off-putting.While M Night Shyamalan's writing and directing skills are still shaky, I feel that he's become consistently strong again in the cinematography department. The shots are as sharp and focused as they were in the two prior movies, even if the editing is less inspired. Also, Glass contains far less subtlety and attention to detail, which is made worse by characters overexplaining everything that the audience could have figured out themselves.The film gives the impression that it is building to an eruptive conclusion, but what we end up with is a fairly disappointing climax which is far less than what the trilogy deserves, and also proves that The Beast really only works in small doses. Nonetheless, James McAvoy is mostly as good in this as he was in Split, although every other returning actor seems to be phoning it in a bit.Split and Unbreakable are both far more creative and worthwhile movies, but Glass provides a mostly satisfactory continuation of their stories. However, if you haven't seen either of them, this probably isn't the film for you.",Glass

702,s511358,"A Subversive, Clever Film",9,3 January 2020,"Though a rather slow-moving finale to an unconventional superhero trilogy, ""Glass"" subverts expectations in a way that leaves the viewer thinking long after they leave the theater. One detail in particular I noticed was the film's use of color, with Elijah's purple opposing Kevin's yellow (complementary colors, equal length apart on a color wheel), while David's green outfit leaves him in the middle (green is made of blue and yellow, making David relate more to Kevin's yellow, but is a piece of Elijah's purple, as a testament to their history together from ""Unbreakable""). All the while, Staple's washed out pinks and whites in the asylum attempts to wash out their colors, convincing them they are not as superhuman as they believe (also, the brain is often portrayed as pink, connecting her sweetness to a form of intelligence). I have never seen a film that uses color theory so thoroughly in its craft that I could remember it for so long. Each shot is meticulous and precise in it's vision.James MacAvoy, who plays Kevin, is brilliant as a man with multiple personalities. The scene where he must switch through a multitude of personalities is such a joy to watch, and will surely make you either laugh uncontrollably or squirm uncomfortably (especially with Patricia and Hedwig). David Dunn, played by Bruce Willis, is stoic and stern as always, but you can see doubt in his eyes after listening to the many lies of Dr. Staple. Samuel L Jackson's character Elijah, though frail in nature, seems so devious in masterminding the whole story despite being in a wheelchair, silent as can be.Shyamalan's subversion of the big tower fight scene trope makes sense in it's nature, as Elijah had to have known that they would all die before they would get close enough to the tower to justify his reasoning. The idea of using the internet as a way to convince the world that they exist is genius. They don't justify Elijah's actions, but he does get the affirmation he needed that he wasn't a mistake or the freak of nature he had so long believed he was.This movie has stuck in my mind all year, and I continue to look back on it with fond memories of the genius at work in it. I don't care that the critics didn't enjoy this as much as Shyamalan's previous works of genius like ""Unbreakable"" or ""The Sixth Sense,"" but I can overlook the flaws of this movie enough to speak of its unbridled greatness.",Glass
703,Theatrical_mess1,Fine if you binged the first 2 beforehand. But on rewatch?,4,7 June 2019,"This film took McAvoy (admittedly still great) and turned his character into a cartoon character. Seeing Jackson, and Willis return was great. Unfortunately the only great thing of the 2 were their hilarious death scenes. In a movie that slings more towards unbreakable, it's obvious the studio knew people went to see it for the continuation of Split.

Many nods to the original Unbreakable and a nice segue from Split.Towards the end of the film, things became a bit too rushed and (spoiler), the death of the 3 main characters felt unceremonious and unresolved. It didn't feel complete or even necessary to take it that route. I liked the movie, but I looked at the scrub timer to see if there were going to be any outros or followups to the main characters' demises. None to be found. So I was left scratching my head.I really enjoyed the movie, I just didn't like how it concluded.

Instead we saw one at the start and one at the end. Within the first 10 minutes of the film we are locked up with all the characters in one location. We stay there for what seems an eternity and I was just about going to give up on the film. My recommendation would be to watch the first 10 minutes of the movie and the last 15. Everything in between is truly awful.
The fights that were there were entertaining. They were not the best choreographed fights, but they fit the characters somewhat. And they had some interesting camera angles. Bruce Willis gets about as much screen time as the director's cameo.

I think people who wrote bad reviews for Glass are just upset because it is the last of the trilogy or they didn't watch the first 2. Just the screenplay was a bit problematic as it feels jumpy and somewhat inconsistent. Every actor stays true to their character and James McVoy shines. For some reason, I felt Sarah Paulson's performance was weird and robotic. May be they should have cast someone else. Cinematography was great.

718,raja_sarkar,Impetuous,3,14 April 2019,"In neurocinematics, often audience's expectations are inadvertently synced with predictability. The exception happens when the audience is well acquainted with the particular director's end game. In case of Glass, Mr. Shyamalan kept up with his oeuvre of twisting the ending of his own story - something common to his style of story-telling. With a successful trilogy in the making, Mr. Shyamalan has somewhere felt encumbered to conclude the plots and characters in the way most of his fanboys won't like, but then this has been his panache. As a director, his abilities are certainly unquestionable but his intentions are not, not after watching this movie. It seemed to me that he had to compulsively deliver a unique bending to the conclusion unmatched to any of his audiences' expectations - just to satisfy his abilities to create and destruct his own creations at his sole will.Run-of-the-mill movies tends to have bog-standard ending. Remarkable movies show distinctive and sometimes iffy denouements. This movie manages to skip both and ends up dividing and breaking hopes and sentiments. Great stories have a tendency to become tarnished if not written at a go. That's how they end up not being an epic. Gaps in writing stories have often proved fatal because all pieces fit together but in the wrong places!The conclusion felt like straitjacketing the enormous capabilities of a fitting ending, almost ends up cheating the audience's enthusiasm. In an attempt to embrace realities, the director killed the cinematic qualities required for a movie of such proportion.The actors have justified the characters as far as humanely possible, but their performance is overshadowed by director's idea of settling the characters. The problem, I see, lies somewhere between the story which have more plot-holes than any recent a-grade movie, the editing which should learn from Shyamalan's earlier movies and the screenplay which is just insipid. An unwonted super-hero story ends up in an unpredicted and gloomy ending. Evidently this is a demotion of the storyline and an attenuation of its characters, who are unfortunately unrestorable. The audience of this movie are either the fanboys or a regular cinema watcher - both somewhere got disturbed by its conclusion - both are the victims of director's choice.",Glass

721,pronoun36,An Unbroken Trilogy,7,11 March 2019,"The highly anticipated sequel to 2017's Split and, to the surprise of many audiences, 2000's Unbreakable, Glass ties both of these stories and characters together in this third installment from director M.Night Shyamalan. In this crossover, Bruce Willis' David Dun comes into conflict with the infamous Beast, played by James McAvoy. Samuel L. Jackson also reprises his role as the title character Mr.Glass. All three of these characters wind up in the same mental institution and are repeatedly questioned by Sarah Paulson's Dr.Staple, who believes they are all delusional of their extraordinary abilities. By far the best part about this film is watching the three main leads interact with one another. Not only is it satisfying to see, but the script offers well written dialogue for the characters to say. I also really appreciated the film's themes, which dive deeper into the ideals explored in Unbreakable. The climax also carries a lot of dramatic weight. I won't spoil what happens, but Shyamalan makes a dramatic screenwriting choice that really pays off, making this film stand out even more. It shows there was care put into the picture and it wasn't just gonna ride the hype train to increase ticket sales. Glass is not unbreakable, however. I did not think Bruce Willis' character received nearly as much screen time as he should have. He feels more like he's in the background of the film opposed to a major character. In addition, the subplots concerning the supporting cast analyzing the unfolding events feels tired and not very interesting. We've already seen a lot of these scenes in Unbreakable, so they don't offer anything that feels fresh in this film. It almost seems like the time dedicated to the supporting cast should have been cut in half and given to Bruce Willis' character instead. Despite its flaws, however, Glass was an overall satisfying film that brought to the table many great interactions and intriguing themes, along with a great sense of care from M.Night Shyamalan.",Glass

I can't really recall much about this movie, and I just watched it three hours ago. And that's my main complaint. It's incredibly boring. I was playing on my DS while watching this and it was still agonizingly boring. It just felt so long. Now, I should probably get to my second complaint, everything else. I had neutral feelings about Glass until they made a salt bae joke. It was then that I realized what I had gotten myself into. This movie couldn't decide what it wanted to be. If it brands itself as a superhero movie, it's like the worst superhero movie ever. If it brands itself as a psychological thriller, it's like the worst psychological thriller ever.

But suddenly all comes loose and the movie completely falls apart and become a teenage nonsense on a parking lot. Felt like a certain vampire movie.
Shyamalan didnt even bother to do some research on therapy and hospitals. Looks like a high school kid directed the movie. No credibility on any hospital scene.
The suspense simply isnt there AT ALL. The Beast shows up everty 5 minutes and take away the suspense of SPLIT. The multiple personalites are used as comic relieve, instead of adding to the plot.
The dioloques are horrible and unable to make you believe the characters, specially the doctors theories. Not for a second she fouled the audience.

724,Gpanther67,"Thjis ""Glass"" is half-empty",5,19 January 2019,"These days you're not sure what you will get from M. Night Shyamalan. Will it be something that resembles a modern-day Twilight Zone episode? A film dark and thrilling film with a shock ending or will it be a nonsensical bore. Shyamalan has delivered both types in his past. ""The Sixth Sense"" was a thriller that won many over and helped build a loyal fanbase. His hits like ""Signs"" and fanboy favorite ""Unbreakable"" pushed his popularity to unbelievable heights but then there were movies like ""The Last Airbender"" and ""The Happening"", horrible flops that disappointed everyone. He has been on an upswing lately with small budget hits like ""The Visit"" and ""Split"" which gave us his signature shock ending when it was revealed that the film was set in the world of ""Unbreakable"". Now being called the Eastrail 177 Trilogy, we get to see if Shyamalan is still on a roll with ""Glass"" or if he has gone back to his old mistakes.
The film opens with Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy), a man suffering from multiple personalities, who has kidnapped another group of teens (like he did in ""Split""). David Dunn (Bruce Willis) has been searching the city for them with the help of his son. Wearing a poncho, he has become a vigilante called ""The Overseer"", who protects the innocent from harm. He finds Crumb who has tapped into his dangerous persona called ""The Beast"", a being who exhibits animal like abilities and strength. The two battle and are apprehended by authorities led by Dr. Ellie Staple (Sarah Paulson) who is the head doctor of the mental institution that also holds Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) aka. Mr. Glass, the archenemy of David Dunn. The men are counseled by Dr. Staple who tells them that they are not superheroes or villains and that all of their abilities can be explained with common logic. Price is heavily sedated and nearly in a catatonic state, but we soon discover that he is fooling the staff and has a grand evil scheme that needs The Beast for his plans and Dunn to once again believe that he is a superhero.
""Glass"" reminds me of a long, dull trip that is even more disappointing when you get to your destination. Plodding along with a slow, listless story; the film drags us through with little excitement or suspense. Shyamalan could have gone so many different ways but instead of a superhero film, he makes us feel more like we are watching a bad version of ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", with Paulson playing a ridiculous Nurse Ratched, whose sole purpose is to convince the men they are not gifted. In a strange, almost social satire sort-of-way, the film's purpose is to teach you to not let others convince you that you aren't special. It's a nice sentiment but Shyamalan hammers the message too hard and often, it ends up becoming annoying. Its one of those films that has a two-hour run time but feels like three. I will give kudos to McAvoy, who does a good job playing his multiple personalities with conviction. He nails the physicality and accents of different personalities but most of his lines are ridiculous and that goes back to Shyamalan's fault. Jackson does typical Samuel L. Jackson shtick, which can be entertaining but if you are tired of it, you won't find his participation helpful. Worse of all, Willis once again dials in a stone-cold performance as if his heart wasn't into it. I get the feeling he was as disappointed with the script as we will be and just wanted to get through this one as fast as he could. All of this trudging leads us to a completely underwhelming and ridiculous ending with a trio of Shyamalan inspired surprises involving the identity of Crumb's father, Dr. Staple's true agenda and the silliest, stupidest final scene I have seen in a film in years. Shyamalan really truly fumbled this one and this might be his most disappointing film because I did enjoy the previous two films and hate that the trilogy finished with a resounding thud.
No this isn't M. Night Shyamalan at his worse, that stigma will probably always be reserved for ""The Happening"" but when I finished ""Split"" and heard he was doing this film, I was high with anticipation. I wish I could just go back in time and warn myself not to work myself up too much, I am going to be let down.

728,rawena_bll,Didn't meet expectations,3,14 April 2019,"I expected more from this movie. It was very ""meh"", and because I had very high expectations I had to give it an unusual 3 stars.The cast was great, McAvoy kept the movie interesting enough that I didn't walk out no matter how much I wanted to. I really enjoyed watching his character(s). Sarah Paulson was a good choice for the chaotic neutral, creepy psychiatrist. Some characters seemed to be instructed to keep a perfect straight face no matter what happens- let it be your loved one dying in your arms or something else- which felt like they were trying too hard. It wasn't realistic and that kept reminding me this was a movie and I had a hard time getting sucked in.The movie was so slow and kept making me think that there was more, so much more, after all this build up I thought I was going to get a mind blowing ending. Nothing happened, most of the stuff was very predictable. The ""twist"" at the end created by the super-intelligent villain(?) was very weak. The whole thing was stale, it was one note. Also not a big fan of the cool palette. There was no contrast in anywhere, nothing was pleasing to look at. My personal dislike of hospitals and closed areas did not make it easier.Did not like it, it was boring, and not because I expected a super-cheesy super hero movie, I'm not even a fan of those. The execution and the pilot just wasn't strong enough to me. Every other scene I rolled my eyes because the movie approached everything in the most cliche and superficial way possible. Which was weird because I think this was a whole new angle on the super hero hype.",Glass
729,carsontuscany,A Pure Masterpiece,10,19 January 2019,"Yes, I know what you're thinking when you see the title of my review. You think I'm crazy and delusional, and that there is no way this movie is a 10/10 from a director like Shamylan who often takes risks that don't pay off. Yes, the fact that I'm a giant fan of Unbreakable and Split, and consider them on my list of favorite movies does make a little difference. The job that Shamylan does in this whole trilogy with character development is unmatched by any other in my opinion. You feel for Elijah, David, and Kevin, no matter what they've done in their lives. Shamylan shows you their past and what made them who they are today. Elijah never has known his place in the world and never felt he has fit in anywhere. David a man going through a struggling family life. Kevin coping with the fact that his mother abused him as a child and his father left. You feel for all of these characters and have an emotional connection with them. Glass takes two of my favorite movies of all time, and turns it into arguably my favorite movie of all time. I understand those hating on this movie and saying it's ""weird"", but that's what it's supoosed to be. It's a Shamylan movie, it's not supposed to be mainstream, and not everyone is supposed to like it. But if you have connected with this series of movies as much as I have, you will love this film. The acting is superb, 10/10. Mcavoy gives one of my favorite performances of all time. You genuinely think this man is insane and he's perfect for this role. As in Unbreakable, Willis and Jackson KILL it, but we expected no less from two legends. The plot is so unpredictable, and you never know exactly what is going to happen. I have seen many, many movies over the years, and am always critical and find a few holes in them that keep them from a 10. But I honestly see no holes or things I didn't like in this. The ending was the perfect ending to this series in my opinion, and I was SO satisfied. This is my first 10/10 star movie I have ever done, and this is definitely the movie that deserves it. Purely amazing.",Glass

James McAvoy is just astounding in his ability to truly BE the characters, giving them truth and depth and even the ability to change his actual physique to some degree.

733,gurunathankrishnan,"A simple plot with a twisted climax. If you haven't watched ""Unbreakable"" or ""Split"", you will not understand the premise.",7,23 February 2019,"Plot:The movie is set around 2 weeks after ""Beast"" emerges (in Split movie). David (Bruce Wills), ""Unbreakable"" super hero who doesn't get hurt except through water, sets out to find him. He meets ""Beast"" but before he could finish him, they both are captured by a psychiatrist Dr. who puts them in a locked facility along with Elijah aka Mr Glass (Unbreakable villain) and tries to prove that they three are just normal humans with brain disorders. Why does she do that? Do they accept they are normal humans? What happens next is all the movie is aboutWhat worked well?James McAvoy: He charmed and terrorized through his performance in movie ""Split"" with his multiple personalities (24 personalities), the most dangerous being ""Beast"". He excels in these personalities namely as a 9 year old child (Hedwig), a sophisticated English woman(Patricia), professor, soft nature person (Kevin), tough young lad (Dennis) and of course ""Beast"" - with his body language, acting and just his eyes. You will be blown in a sequence where he changes to all these personalities in seconds!!! Mind blowing!!!! He shines amongst Bruce Willis or Samuel Jackson in this movie
Theme of the movie: The movie is about Superheroes - Hold on!!! It's not about people wearing spandex costumes, flying all over the universe destroying half the world (especially America) in the name of saving the world, with mind blowing & rhetoric VFX and having melodramatic sacrificial theme at the end. NO!!! This movie is about people with superhuman abilities living among the general population. It touches humanity in a different angle - Yeah I liked it!!! (I was anyway fed up of weekly Marvel and DC releases with VFX like video games). I could find a sensibility in the approach. The whole movie revolves around a locked up mental facility trying to address the inner sensibilities
Technically, the film is mind-blowing - what I mean is the camera work, BGM, dialogues etc.
Twist: When you wonder what the director can offer, you will be startled with multiple twists at the end but have to agree that climax twist is a dud!!! Moreover, it keeps you guessing till the end though at times it tests the patience
What didn't work well?The movie starts off with a fantastic encounter between David and Beast - truly remarkable but suddenly gets a pause with a locked up facility. While the climax reveals it, we wonder till such time why the hell they have been locked up and what's the point in proving they are normal humans.
James McAvoy shines - Others have lesser role or they get overshadowed in his presence. Wish I could see more of David (my favourite movie is ""Unbreakable"")
Climax: I should admit it's slightly messed up (No spoilers) but then it ends with a possibility of a new genre of movies with a different super human capabilities!!!
My favourites among M Night Shyamalan are ""Unbreakable"" and ""Split"". I couldn't resist watching when these two main characters reprise in a single plot. M Night Shyamalan also gave some of the most stupid movies after Unbreakable till Split. So, there's very few audience who would like to see the movie. Additionally, ""Unbreakable"" is a cult movie which wasn't appreciated in it's time.""Glass"" revolves around Comic books and how it has framed the world - with the current generation who doesn't read comic books and have only witnessed it through Marvel/DC movies, they may not be able to appreciate a different superhero theme!!!In my view, if you haven't watched ""Unbreakable"" and ""Split"", don't go without watching those!!! If you haven't liked the earlier ones, you will certainly not like this one. In my view, this movie will also become a cult movie in the later years though it's being critically panned by most!!!If you are tired of VFX and want some sensible movie (ofcourse barring the climax), go for it!! Though my views are also mixed, I would suggest watching it once!!!",Glass

738,Stenun,"The usual ""problems"" with nearly every M, Night Shyamalan movie ...",6,9 February 2019,"The word ""problems"" is in inverted commas in the title of this review because it's not really a problem per se. It's just that with nearly every M. Night Shyamalan movie, the movie that is advertised is often not the movie that you start watching and is rarely the movie you end up watching just before the credits roll. Things change so much and a lot of people don't like that. Which is not a criticism of them, it's just a matter of personal taste.
But it's well made. It's written well, it's acted well, it's directed well. It just doesn't do what a lot of people thought it would. Which leads to lower scores from some because they wanted something different from what they got. For example, the title character doesn't even speak for the first hour of the film. Those expecting a maniacal mastermind chewing the scenery are going to be disappointed. So of course they'll give it a lower score.
Simply put, this is an M. Night Shyamalan movie. If you saw Unbreakable and Split without too much prior knowledge of what was going to happen beyond the initial premise, you know to expect the same sort of thing from Glass. And what's wrong with that?",Glass
739,Geniface,Oh my goodness.....,10,8 March 2019,"When I saw that Glass was coming out, I was super excited. And this movie did not disappoint. Make sure you see Unbreakable and Split first. And M. Night Shyamalan, you really know how to get under someone's skin.

Actings are good for obvious reasons ( a+ actors) , James McAvoy is amazing BUT there is a plot hole which I can't seem to overlook. 3 extremely dangerous and strong men ( a mass murderer with an genius IQ, one men with super strength and one men with 24 personalities one personality being a super wild, wall climbing monster ) are hold in a facility and there is an obvious lack of security. Even the prison has better security and more staff. You are keeping these men under the supervision of a female doctor and as I can see 3 nurses/caretakers and one man who is opening and closing the facility doors. That is bulls..t now come on...this is a scenario mistake and I think is a big one..",Glass
741,hankychan,I wasn't expecting to love this at all,7,12 September 2019,"Wow. Ok.I consider unbreakable a masterpiece and Split a pretty great film, besides those and The Sixth Sense I hadn't liked any of the other films I'd seen from him. This film got pretty mixed reviews and it was a modern Shyamalan script so I was skeptical.The first act was pretty great, maybe a bit slow but that does lend well to making the film feel like more of an epic, the second act had me fuming, there is a twist that had me genuinely angry, then as the film keeps going and more is revealed I slowly realized how incredible the whole thing is, by the end I was more engaged then I have been while watching a film for a while, during the last 20 minutes I was pretty consistently in tears. What Shyamalan did destroyed my expectations, it was perfect.Aside how great the story is and how perfectly it blends with the previous two films, this film is incredibly beautiful visually, it has the same cinematographer as ""Us"", ""Split"" and David Robert Mitchell's newest film, out of these this is by far his best work, despite it's visual beauty, it lacks what split lacks, the extreme intelligence of framing and blocking that Unbreakable had, Unbreakable in my eyes is one of the most precise and perfectly framed films ever, Shyamalan has lost that it seems, and I think the incredible beauty of his latest two has more to do with his incredible cinematographer then him.Anyway, I really hope Shyamalan keeps up this recent rebound and continues to make great films, because when he makes bad films he makes really bad films but when he makes great ones he makes films that really resonate with me and manage to dig deep into my heart.Ps. This is definitely in the top 5 superhero movies I've seen",Glass

743,sushilp17,Same Unbreakable Mistake,7,13 August 2020,"M. Night Shyamalan surprised audiences with his plot twists in The Sixth Sense and Signs, but he only confuses audiences with his plot twists in other movies.In Unbreakable, David Dunn is overcoming his reluctance to be a superhero. In Split, Casey is coming to terms with childhood trauma. What value is added to Unbreakable when we learn Mr. Glass was responsible for bringing out the hero in David Dunn? What value is added to Split when we learn that Kevin Crumb and David Dunn exist in the same universe?Glass could have been interesting as a movie if all the characters were exclusively motivated to prove that they actually have superpowers. Gaslighting is clearly the primary antagonist in this movie. What value was added to the movie by revealing to us that Kevin Crumb's Dad died on the same train survived by David Dunn? There could have been value in us learning about Dr. Staple's true intentions and Mr. Glass's full plans, but unfortunately those reveals were basically tagged on in the end.",Glass

745,kvang145,When Drama (Split) Crossover To the Action (Unbreakable) Fails,4,21 April 2019,"Pretty much the movie has great ideas and wonderful plot. Glass is a mixture of the drama of Split, while finally taking the extra foot into the comic, or fiction, world of Unbreakable, or so you would think. In reality it's pretty much a confusion and disorder of two genre that didn't know what it was.
While Unbreakable has full action and demonstrates what superpower is, you don't see any of that here. The action in Glass is horrible, limited to almost nothing. Instead of seeing a man launch into the air with a punch, or stopping gun shots, what we see is people making dents in metals, doing acrobatics, and body wrestling. There is no superpower involved in this third chronological film. Total failure to the eyes of Unbreakable fans.
As for the drama... it's a mixture. Everything was great, all except the main course. By now everyone should at least know ""TheHorde"" has multiple personality or characters embedded into him, base on how well it was portrayed in the last film on Split. Instead of continuing the character from there, we get to see a whole new different ""character"". Unlike Split, in Glass, TheHorde changes personality VISIBLY by grunting and acting in pain, (reminder, in Split, his transformation is subtle). Not does it only sticks out, his monologues and acting is terrible. They bring no importance or emotions whatsoever. It's like the director told him to keep transforming is personality because he's not sure the audiences are certainly aware that he has split personality yet.
Gotta say, Bruce Willis is a nice fan treat, but his actions were slow and low. As a human being, I know that age has it's limitations, but in the eyes of movie audiences, those kind of actions/acting makes it seems like he didn't want to be in the movie, or he's really weak.
The only saving grace is the last trio, Mr. Glass. The twist of his plots and mastermind made the movie a poetic masterpiece. However, that doesn't make rights to the horrible performance of 2/3 of the show.
Overall, this movie is like an action movie that is performed by teens. You have to use your imagination in order to understand what's happening.
Performance by adults=bravo,
Performance by kids=how cute,
Performance by teens=um... sure...",Glass

Overall, I enjoy the film, but it has some messy plot points that involve Sarah Paulson's character the most. The first and some of the 2nd act was spectacular, but ending off the 2nd act is where i had trouble understanding. It felt like Shyamalan didn't know what to do with these characters. Plus how to end the unbreakable trilogy. McAvoy and Samuel L Jackson did well. Anya Taylor Joy and David Dunn son (forgot his name) were good also. Bruce Willis's David Dunn didn't have alot of screen time. Which to me is strange. He's the main character. If Shyamalan had full creative control of the film. He needs someone to look over his future projects. He's starting to fall back into the films that were plain awful. Like The Last Airbender and Lady in the water. I hope Glass gets a sequel. I'm pretty sure we are going to need another film to satisfy our needs. Don't expect a masterpiece, but go in with low expectations and i think you will enjoy Glass.",Glass

Jackson as Mr Glass, the mastermind supervillain who always has a plan and knows comics like all of us. The whole movie was going so well up until the end (it's M. Night Shyamalan movie of course, the plot twist).I was so pissed Shayamalan killed off Glass, David Dunn and James McAvoy. I was also really looking forward for David Dunn vs the Beast in front of a big crowd but it was still a good fight though. An evil organisation was indeed surprising as well.

The motivations of Glass and the serious woman don't have the minor sense, the final scene, is so poor visually, than I wondered about if Unbreakable was filmed for the same director, nothing I liked in Unbreakable is present here.

Let's swap them so as people to think we did something great.Tron, Indiana Jones, BladeRunner and the list goes on.
Glass continues this Hollywood tendency.I don't really care if the casting is exactly the same as before 20 years.
The real problem is that M. Night Shyamalan tried to once more to apply some magic to his movie, but the days he surprised us again and again has long gone.The same boring ""cinematic"" scenes, are being repeated and tbh I hated watching Sarah Paulson's face trying to fit into the whole screen again and again.As all of Shyamalan's movies, there's always a mystery that needs to be explained or a mystery that nobody cares why it exists on a realistic representation of reality.

757,Jarodaily,A superhero movie in its raw form,8,17 January 2019,"For someone who grew up from watching countless superhero films like Marvel and DC. This movie taught me a lesson that nothing is impossible for humans to hone our super-abilities that we can never learn from the norms. This is definitely a superhero movie in its raw form - ""origins"" in the words of Mr. Glass.If you're looking for a superhero movie like Marvel/DC where there are tons of special effects, explosions like Michael Bay, and comedic banters of your favorite avenger - stay away from this. But if you enjoy a serious tone and a very deep storyline about superheroes, then this ones for you.I suggest you watch Unbreakable & Split (in its proper order) for you to understand the characters even more. There probably won't be another sequel but if you're looking for one, you might enjoy watching the first X-men movie along with its whole timeline. Given the fact that there's a notable impression of Hedwig (The Horde) mocking Mr. Glass on a wheelchair about Professor X ability who James McAvoy played as in X-men.For moviegoers who enjoys watching a superhero film and those who goes out of the theatre feeling like one - you won't gain a ""special ability"" from watching Glass but you'll gain respect for being unique and different. The last part was so special for me as an avid fan of superheroes - in believing that ordinary people can be extraordinary as to what is impossible can be possible.There's also a short flashback of David Dunn (Unbreakable) that explains their Father & son bond from the first movie to Glass. All the characters from the first two movie (Unbreakable and Split) progresses here so you'll see all of them having a grand reunion/showdown in this movie. I love how difficult it is to tell who the real villain is but I swear to god it pissed me off - which is a good plot twist for this trilogy. The only disappointing part is I can surely see that there will be no sequel to this cinematic universe yet they can still make a spin-off out of the New World Order and the Gods among us.",Glass
758,stevie-parmentier-360-779691,A decent watch ... just not good enough to ever be rewatched,5,27 August 2021,"When a movie tries to blend two previous movies together to create an encompassing story, you expect it to be better than either of those two movies and to give a satisfying end to both in the process. Sadly enough, this movie fails in both areas.There's quite a bit this movie does right - you really want to dislike the doctor in charge of the facility, the premise is a strong one, the acting is of a very high level and the dialog is mostly great.It's just sad that the movie fails to live up to its potential. There's tons and I mean TONS of illogical story elements in a movie that pretends it's clever. You can't both have the most obvious and idiotic plot holes as well as pretend you're more clever than the viewer. It doesn't work like that.For example, not a single mental institute in the WORLD would use actual glass in a patient's room. Having just a single guard there at night makes zero sense. Having no-one check on that single person again makes zero sense. Having a massive camera system that only one person views makes zero sense. Them not noticing certain camera feeds were interrupted makes zero sense. There's way more such plot holes but I'd get into spoilers there - especially towards the end.In fact, the plot holes are so bad, they undermine the very idea of the end of the movie. Some is not even plot holes but rather demanding the audience to go along with things that make little sense. I can ignore some of this but not when over half the movie relies on these weaknesses. It makes for a very shake foundation to build your movie on.The sad thing is, this could have been done much better. The premise is a good one but the execution is flawed and nowhere near clever enough to work.",Glass

DO NOT read on if you have not seen this movie as im about to spoil it.
Starting at the end sequence which is around 20 or so minutes. It was terrible. Why build up 3 important characters in 3 movies so much just to knock them off in such a stupid way. I actually felt cheated. It was like Alien 3 when the director killed off Newt at the beginning. WHY make her so important in the previous films then!
The scene is just so boring it's difficult to explain how bad it was. The whole security cameras thing was just tragic and explained poorly i was actually coming up with plot twists in my head to try make it more exciting. I thought maybe the cameras were installed by David Dunns home security or something and the 3 of them were all in it together. I dno but i was so bored I wanted out the cinema quickly.Middle scene next. when the 3 main characters are being interrogated by the institute doctor. (Who you know nothing about even when she reveals her true identity.) Your just left scratching your head about her. Anyway, i think this was Nights attempt at some sort of oscar winning scene or something but if that happens il eat my socks. It was drole. There was positives though in James mcavoys continued great multiple personality performance. I enjoyed this but this particular scene still didnt reveal anything of imprtance or help with the direction the movie wanted to go. Just more questions.
Beginning scene . First 45 mins i say.
Strongest part of the movie. Very first scene. Catchy music. Setting the tone. I was thinking 'right here we go something big is gonna happen' and yes you see david sort of some troublesome youths. I also liked how they brought his son in from unbreakable who is like whistler to him from the Blade movies. Even quite a good scene when he fights the beast for first time. Which i think needed a bit more drama . It was quite low key.
Its when they get caught by the police the movie goes down hill.Summary / 2 stars
Just undermined the great character building in the first 2 movies in my opinion.

763,robert-b-norby,The problem with this movie is Split/Unbreakable,7,15 February 2019,"I have but one key input to those willing to read, but let me just get this out of the way first: James is amazing with all of his personas, and the entire rest of the cast is great as well. Shyamalan does wonders for the storytelling aspect of it, with immersive camera transitions and all of the above. It's truly a great movie.But to my point.As many critics yell out: this movie didn't utilize its full potential. I agree with the premise, but not the arguments. The movie does exactly what the movie sets out to do; which is to center around Mr. Glass, and HIS agenda. HIS story. And HIS ending.
The problem as a viewer arises when you just saw Split (or rewatched Unbreakable - my GOD that is a great movie), or saw both, and then went to see this movie hoping for a grand finish to those two previous movies. Yes yes, you get plenty of ""finish"", but perhaps not as much as you hoped. And that is because this movie is Mr. Glass's movie, and then at the same time, it also wraps up all 3 movies. And then it's kind of its own movie as well.. I dont know.Whatever it is, it seems a bit too much to do in one movie, at the expense of expectations. And that's what I believe is the downside. You come in with your mind and interest centered around Unbreakable or Split, and then the final keystroke of the plot places Mr. Glass in center - whom you are slightly less interested in.Finally; as I always try to do with my reviews;
If you read this before watching the movie - and you are a bit like me - I hope this will adjust your expectations and make the movie even more enjoyable. Whether or not I succeed with that, you should still watch the movie - if only for McAvoy's performance and the great camera work :)",Glass

It hit me then that I had understood the whole story wrong.I had been trying to connect Unbreakable and Shift to the storyline of Glass, but there was a key point missing. But that's the thing. Don't watch the movies with the prequels in mind, more so Shift. You will be confused and feel cheated by how Glass will seem to fall short of its potential.I had expected there to be more action in Glass because each character had previously had intense action in the previous movies.Later on, I understood that Glass is a unique story best understood from the ending to the start of the story.In short, keep an open mind and don't think you know until you really understand what each character's position is in the entire narrative.",Glass

The beginning was great, the middle was okay and the ending was also okay. It was a little bit too long. 30 minutes shorter and the movie was better and probably got an 8/10 from me.
I never saw Unbreakable, because I don't like Bruce Willis. But in this movie he did a good job, surprisingly. James and Samuel were great as always.
With M. night Shyamalan you never expect a good Oscar wourthy movie, so dont expect it this time too. Just go and enjoy it.

I hoped this the film would be as solid as 'Split,' but it's nowhere near that standard.The power of McAvoy's split personality character gets a bit diminished with all the switches and the extended dialogue of 'The Beast.'Samuel L. Jackson's character, Mr. Glass is pretty much the same character Jackson plays in just about every film or commercial in which he is cast. I feel similariky of Bruce Willis' character; he feels, sounds and moves like characters from most of Willis' action flicks.Even though I'm not a fan of Jackson or Willis, they're both good actors. McAvoy and Paulson are phenomenal; they're both excellent chameleons and truly vanish into their roles. Shymalan didn't capitalize on the talent he had available for this film.",Glass
768,andyfindlay,The divide between critics and audience widens.,7,22 January 2019,"Coming off his shock hit 'Split', M. Night Shyamalan set big boots to fill, considering this as the bring together of two of his most popular films, it would be easy to say it is underwhelming, but taking Glass as its own individual film, provides it to be a much stronger film all round. Shyamalan remains to be his own worst enemy, after many years of a downwards spiral, he jumped back into his mojo, considering both his recent hits (The Visit and Spilt) were strong, it shows he does his best work when it goes unnoticed. Almost suggesting as if being in the spotlight put too much pressure on him.James McAvoy gives yet another award worthy performance, the way he switches in and out of the multiple personality is chilling. Bruce Willis is fine, he does nothing outstanding, but does nothing bad. Samuel L Jackson, well, for half the film did not do anything, and all he did in the second was be irritating. Besides McAvoy, the film's supporting cast do a lot of the heavy lifting. Sarah Paulson, excels on all fronts, being significantly more captivating than both Willis and Jackson. Anya Taylor Joy gives another credible performance but remained completely underused.A lot of the film was extremely enjoyable, an entertainment factor was sustained throughout, but did fall apart near the end, the twists instead of being smart were silly and predictable, none packed any punch nor calibre and did not give the intended response subsequently making the ending excruciatingly poor. But that was only 10 minutes or so. Continuous superhero connotations started off as smart but soon lost its effect, leading to a couple of sighs, the idea behind playing on the notion of superheros can be appreciated but did become irritating when over done.A mention has to be given to the gorgeous colour pallet and brilliant cinematography throughout. Probably the most stand out feature from the entire movie.",Glass

The first act has some fantastic action sequences, and for fans of Unbreakable, you'll love the nostalgic feeling you get.Sadly, it's all downhill from there. Elijah and David barely have any talking time with each other, which was weird when considering the history the two of them have together. Speaking of Elijah, he is severely underused during the first act and some of the second act.The third act is one big dumpster fire. There were so many ways you could take the final thirty minutes, and it's like M. Night Shyamalan purposefully chose the worst one to piss off the audience. Oh, and the ending? One of the most unsatisfying and frustrating endings ever.Regarding the acting, James McAvoy gives a stupidly good performance. Seriously, it's some of the best I've seen, and without his return, this movie would be a complete piece of garbage. Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson are solid in their respective roles for the content that was given to them.I'm a massive fan of Unbreakable and enjoyed Split, so as a fan of the two films, I hate the fact that this is one of the most disappointing movies I've seen.

776,andreideceu,I mean...,8,15 February 2021,"There are many pros and cons about the ending of this trilogy.
I guess some people would not be content to the ending delivered by N. S. ,whatever the ending would be.
For me, Glass should have been at least one hr longer, trying to pursue the loose ends that still remain loose after the movie has ended. I wish David Dunn would have more screen time and more active participation in the script. I wish that the kids - Casey and Joseph - would have some callings of their own. Nonetheless, its awesome to see Joseph fully grown - and although my wishes never came to life, both him and Casey acted very well given the empty script that they were put in front of.
To be honest, im lost for words because i dont know what i feel at the moment. The movie had a deep impact over me but in the same time left me with a sour taste in my mouth.
I appreciate the script around Mr. Glass but the way i see it this should have gone further and it missed in depth massively.
Im left wanting to see what will happen to this secret organization, im left wanting more from this universe, which i feel, ended abruptly and even tho i did not dislike one second of this finale, i dislike the fact that it is exactly that - the finale - made from a possible 4 hr movie into a 2 hr one - leaving a lot of possible content out for some reason.
N. S. seemed to rush this,even tho it came after 3 years after Split was released. Maybe he needed another 13 to match the expectations...
All in all, i feel quite hollow at the moment as im very receptive to movies i expect the world out of. I said in a previous review of the movie Split, that Glass cannot miss(before seeing it) . I am not sure what to believe at the moment.
For sure a good trilogy ! For sure, Split was phenomenal, and McAvoy did just great - switching alters from one sentence to another is just...amazing. If something went 100% right, is how he played.
I think this trilogy needs to be seen by everyone. There are a lot of good things you can take from these movies.8/10 because not too many movies leave me with the idea that if i had the money id pay for its production to go further.",Glass

Whether it's a high praise due to clearly political reasons or misguided hate towards pretty decent flicks. This is the latter. For one, all the actors are in the right place, story makes perfect sense as a trilogy even though it didn't seem that way when the idea was introduced.
All the flaws of the first one here are explained and straightened. Yeah, this movie itself is not perfect (little problems with pacing in the second act), but here is the deal: this movie is enjoyable, clever and dramatic. It's not your great piece of conceptual art and festival material, yet it's clearly an author's film even though being a product of mass culture.
I really felt for the characters and liked the ending very much. That being said, I didn't like all of this director's works. This was more of a pleasant surprise for me, rather than well-anticipated success. And another thing: Bruce Willis. I really like this actor and believe he has real talent. All the more so it was a heartbreak seeing what he has been doing with his career for the past few years. I know he doesn't have to prove anything to anyone, but those B-, C- and D-movies where he simply appears and his lazy acting.. well, that's a bit sad. But here David Dunn looks believable and alive, even though you can still feel that reluctance in the performance of his (character matches the artist I guess). Bruce, come back to us, M.

The acting by everyone was simply amazing, and the movie never really dragged in spots. It also captured the atmosphere which M. Night is known. In that regards, M. Night did a great job.My big issue with the film were twofold (no spoilers):1- The overall lack of security in the hospital. We have a man who mutilated women - the authorities know this, yet people monitoring him enter the room with no guards anyway. There IS a supposed fail-self method of protection, but still...what if that method fails?1b- One of the employees later does something extremely stupid, without first calling a guard. Every human being with an ounce of common sense would have called a guard first (and the police), before undertaking the next step.2- Finally, the climactic fight of the film seemed well...rather silly and lacked the magic and mystique of the previous portion of the film. This was further complicated by a revelation of one of the characters which seemed downright silly.Still, I enjoyed the movie, even with its flaws.

784,emkay905,"2 good acts, went full shyamalan at the end",6,10 January 2019,"This was an enjoyable film for the most part, Night's talents as a director really shone in this film, through his use of framing and colour choices. The final product really highlights the care and thought which Night put into the visual choices of the film. His downfall however is that though he may be a good director, he's also a terrible writer, this is a film which has had 2 great films worth of build-up, and for it's first hour and half, Glass was actually a very enjoyable experience and worthy successor to its predecessors. Willis, McAvoy and Jackson were all wonderful, their characters were incredibly entertaining to watch and their interactions with each other were bloody brilliant. However, unlike its predecessors, Glass was unable to maintain its momentum in its final act, which left me thinking Night chose an ending purely based around the surprise factor rather than a more logical approach. The writing just wasn't very good in my mind, perhaps in his mind, the ending to Glass made perfect sense, however as a viewer i felt i didn't get the satisfaction of fully understanding the motivations and reasoning behind the character choices in that final act of the film.
The large amount of characters featured in this film may have also attributed to this film not working as well as it could have, i think this is because there was a lack of focus. We have 3 main characters, but you don't really feel like you get to spend enough time with any of them through the movie, because there isn't enough focus placed on the characters before the scene transitions. The side characters are also heavily under-used, these characters have scattered and somewhat out of place scenes throughout the movie which i thought could've been completely left in the editing room, with the exception of Willis' character's son, none of the side characters really needed to be in the movie until the final act.I still believe this film was an enjoyable experience, though the ending leaves much to be desired, Shyamalan ends his eastrail 177 trilogy with a fairly mixed bag of a film.",Glass

But, this wasn't like Split, nor was it Unbreakable. Philosophical thoughts swirl at the end making a sudden perspective shift of the prior movie just seen. Manipulation? Maybe. A twist? Possibly (especially from Shyamalan). What the final revelation elicited from me was a very personal awareness of the film. It seemed to pull the film out of the superhero stereotype and plant it firmly in a film of loss and growth. And, from that loss, the characters became people who lived in the real world. Love, grief, pride, etc. became evident. Shyamalan injected humanity to a film about super human powers, what we speak to each other outside of the Marval films (re: Black Widow and Hawkeye). Glass comes with the need for thought and not just viewing for the action (which isn't primary in this film).

788,JP_Shay,A Brilliant Conclussion To a Great Series,10,8 February 2019,"Fans of the first two entries, Unbreakable and Split, are going to be very divided when it comes to M. Night Shyamalan's concluding film, Glass. It is going to be either loved or hated; there is hardly any room for middle ground. Some will feel disappointed by the slow build and lack of a conventional plot, while others will find themselves engaged in the sheer poetic nature M. Night Shyamalan manages to convey throughout the film. It is less an action-packed Superhero movie and more an unapologetic statement about faith, or rather, society's lack of faith in individuality.To understand the message of ""Glass"", one need only look past the basic fundamental principles of what makes a Superhero story. There is a beginning, middle and end to every story, but with Superheroes there is a particular formula that's generally more evocative of childhood fantasies and wish fulfillment, making for exaggerated situations and unbelievable showdowns. Real life is boring without art and entertainment - but what if art and entertainment became real life? What if the colorful illustrations of comic books magically made their way into reality in all their superhuman glory? All the rules that make up a ""superhero story"", Shyamalan relentlessly tears them apart, shakes them up, spits on them, and stomps the remains to the ground.This is all done with love.The characters in ""Glass"" are some of the most human characters ever portrayed in one of his films. David Dunn (Bruce Willis) has been fighting crime with his now grown up son (Spencer Treat Clarke) for the last 19 years. Still sporting the hooded raincoat, he has become something of a symbol of hope for the city. One day, he - very conveniently - bumps into Kevin Crumb (James McAvoy), whom has been terrorizing the community with his kidnapping and killing of young girls. The confrontation that follows results in both of them being sent to a mental asylum - the same one housing Elijah Price aka Mr. Glass (Samuel L. Jackson), whom has remained there for the same length of time David has been out fighting crime. This is where the majority of the film takes place.We are given a brief history of who these characters are as they are brought together under the watchful eye of Dr. Ellie Staple (a mesmerizing Sarah Paulson). This is where the story begins to feel like it takes off. The narrative structure of Glass is divided into fragmented flashbacks and an unpredictable turn of events that inspire more meaning to the title. The cinematography is solid enough for a film that takes place mostly indoors; precise interior framing shots capture the cold and threatening atmsophere. While the main cast is given a fair amount of screentime, several familiar faces return including Anya Taylor-Joy, who reprises her role from ""Split"". While Willis and Jackson are solid in their respective roles, it is James McAvoy who once again proves what a versatile actor he is, revealing several previously unseen identities of the Horde along with more of Hedwig, Dennis, Patricia and of course The Beast. It is amazing watching him switch back and forth in an instant from one identity to another.Though, Glass does not offer much in terms of what we are used to in Superhero movies, it provides a vastly different outlook on what such a scenario would be like in real life. Amazing feats of strength, such as a man busting down a steel door or a man walking on walls or flipping over a mini-van feel straight out of a comic book, but at the same time, Shyamalan turns this against us and asks the question, ""What if?"" What if only a few of us had these powers? Would it be fair to the rest? Who are we when stripped of all our abilities? These are the questions Glass asks the viewers and the questions are dealt with by the main characters.The power of faith gives us the answers we seek, but without faith, do we really have anything? At several points in the film, the characters struggle with this question. Take for instance, when David's son sees a big guy at the gym benching more than his dad did back in ""Unbreakable"". He struggles with the idea that maybe his father isn't the Superman-type hero he appears to be. Another example is when Dr. Staple convinces Kevin's other personalities that perhaps ""The Beast"" isn't the almighty powerful being he is worshipped as, which causes the Horde to lose faith in The Beast. Even Elijah must convince himself that he is not a mistake. Once we face who we really are and realize that we are not so different, does that make us less than who we really are?I went into the movie with high expactations and was completely surprised by what I had seen. I was taken aback by the underlying themes and the powerful message it presents. The action is scarce but effective. The pacing fragmented and unique but still it flows. James McAvoy is amazing. Willis brings his A-game. Even though, I found it annoying that Elijah is so aware about where he's at in the comic-book universe and must point it out every chance he gets, Jackson really plays it well and you can tell he's having fun. Sarah Paulson is such a muse and we get lots of her beautiful face in this movie, as she is the glue that bonds it all together in the end. Speaking of the end, this is where the film will surely get split amongst fans. You will either appreciate what Shyamalan has done or be convinced he has made a terrible mistake. I found myself with my mouth wide open as the credits rolled, trying to understand why it ended on such an anti-climatic note . It felt like a slap in the face. It felt like a degrading insult. But the more I thought about it, the more I found myself gradually thinking that it shouldn't have happened any other way.I give ""Glass"" 10/10 not because it's a perfect film (it's not) but because it is a perfect conclusion to a great series.",Glass

The film seemed to fly by really quick, I enjoyed it that much. The storyline was simple, a prison break (or in this case an asylum break). I think Shymalan took many ballsy moves with the whole twist of Elijah killing Kevin's dad on the same train crash that David survived. Therefore, in theory, Elijah created the superheroes. This twist no one could have predicted, as it was so well thought through and really well executed. Talking of executions, the 2nd ballsy twist was killing off, not only Elijah, But Kevin and David. This came as a massive shock and out of no where. To put it simple, they all died so people could see that Superheroes existed. BUT... Ellie Staple is later revealed to be working for a secret society of people who want to essentially kill al heroes so there can be balance in the world. Another amazing twist.

There are a couple of short, uneventful fight scenes, with no outcome... As well as a surprise ending that's a bit of gut-punch to fans of the series.

797,ben6464,Fun and entertaining,7,7 April 2019,I had a great time with split and unbreakable and I was thoroughly looking forward to glass.It starts off strong and had the movie continued with the premise it started with I believe it would have been a stronger movie.It spends most of its time trying to make you doubt the reality of the previous two films and I basically there to set up a twist that everyone knows is coming.I think the movie does just enough to leave a bit of doubt to keep you invested in the main plot of the movie but I was very disappointed by the ending.Either way a good watch and if you enjoyed the first two I'm sure you will take plenty of enjoyment from seeing all three of these characters together.,Glass

After a month since seeing it I have all but forgotten about it except for that horrible, awful ending. I can confidently say if you are seeing this in anticipation of David Dunns return, dont. You will hate it and it will likely destroy the fond appreciation you had for Unbreakable. I used to watch Unbreakable about once a year but thats over. How can you ever enjoy that film again when you know the ultimate and stupid fate of David Dunn. What MKS has accomplished is amazing in that not only did he ruin the entire trilogy but he did it in a way that also ruins the greatness of Unbreakable. I really wish that Glass did not exist because at least then I could still love Unbreakable and imagine for myself what David Dunns story might have been.",Glass

800,daddyxj-1,Broken Glass,5,9 February 2019,"This movie could have been something special but instead it becomes a near miss of a movie. The concept of the movie is great, 3 individuals are captured who believe they are superheroes but a psychiatrist is trying disprove their beliefs. Glass brought up some very thought provoking ideas but does not really play on them. The performances from Samuel L. Jackson, Bruce Willis and James McAvoy were all brilliant and M. Night does write some great dialogue but I feel the script's storyline needed another pass. I really like the idea in the film of trying to prove that superheros are real, that comic books are based on some sort of reality. There was just something about the pacing of the movie that's was just off. Plus I felt like the movie didn't know what it wanted to be...a mystery , a horror movie or a superhero origin story. If they were all three then it did the job very disjointed. Glass had the potential to be something better than what we got. The 3rd act is a mess and very ridiculous compared to the previous two acts. I think another super human should have been introduced or teased. The twist at the end was bad because it was abrupt and seemed like an afterthought. I think this ""twist"" should have been the main drive of the entire film, also I wanted to know more about what this ""twist"" was about. M. Night does a great job with his direction but his script need more work with the storyline. The movie is a good watch just for the 3 leads performances alone but the movie will leave you disappointed.",Glass

Unbreakable guy finds out who Split guy is but they then end up in a psychiatric hospital. Mr. Glass is there. The hospital tries to convince them they are not superheroes/villains. Mr. Glass outsmarts everyone and they all break out. They fight, everybody dies, the end.The performance by James McAvoy was great, but we've already seen Split so I didn't need more of that. Unbreakable guy and Split guy are pretty evenly matched so the fights aren't really interesting. They kill some time in the psychiatric hospital but there's not many twists except that Mr. Glass outsmarts everyone. The overall theme was that some people don't want you to know how special you are. Okay, I agree with that. But really, kind of a disappointment.

The longer it continued the bigger my disappointment grew. In the ending scenes I just face palmed, I just couldn't believe that someone thought that this is good idea. I just cant explain how bad it was. Bruce Willis in his rain coat- a lazy character (and stupid as well) - with one of the stupidest character deaths I have recently seen.
Jackson - with lazy acting and also one of the dumbest masterplans of all times.
And so on - MABY the idea of this film is not so bad, maybe on paper this film looks fine, but with low budget and bad writing/directing this is one of the biggest disappointments in long time.This movie would be fine if this would be Unbreakable 13 not a Third part....",Glass

808,docdebbee-579-544723,James McAvoy should get an Oscar for his performance,10,19 January 2019,"Before seeing this movie, it's imperative to see ""Unbreakable"" & ""Split"" 1st or you'll have no idea what the background is. The acting is superb as the storyline picks up where the other movies left off. There are twists that surprise you every moment but the best part is the exquisite acting by James McAvoy portraying what I take great issue with being called Dissociative Identity Disorder by psychiatrists rather than Multiple Personality Disorder having treated a woman myself as a Family Physician with 14 distinct personalities thru to reintegration, but that's an argument for a medical conference. However, AS an MD with that experience & having seen firsthand how such a patient can switch between personalities in a flash & have very distinct likes & dislikes, I can vouch for how perfect his portrayal is. Imagine a 350 lb woman suddenly becoming a 7 yo girl giggling before your eyes then flipping into an angry 13 year old boy, hitting himself, needing to be calmed down then getting back to the primary person again telling you of her frustration because she keeps trying to eat properly but the 23 yo devious sabatour alter keeps thwarting her efforts as evidenced by the fast food wrappers she finds in her truck. James McAvoy portrays the patient I worked with perfectly, including when she became filled with her own ""beast"" and threw me to the floor. I was given the strength to overcome her along with my nurse and sedated her. As in the movie, it was showing her love and assuring her I'd not give up on her, something she'd been denied, calmed and helped change her. That's not a spoiler as it occurs early in the movie. I'd not seen any other review here from anyone who had actually treated such a patient so I wanted to assure those who either have seen or may do so what is portrayed was outstanding because I've seen it as did my family members who were crucial in helping my patient understand loving families DID exist.",Glass
809,declancampbell92,"Thought provoking thriller, lacks finesse of predecessors Unbreakable and Split.",7,29 July 2021,"Now, I went into this picture as a huge admirer of its two predecessor films, Unbreakable and Split. I can say for the first 2 thirds/3 quarters of the film, I thoroughly enjoyed it and I was thinking Mr Night had actually outdone himself. I have to say, you cannot go into this film expecting an action blockbuster of MCU proportions, this is a much more deep, thinking mans film that you really need to give your undivided attention to, and it's ideas may challenge even the most seasoned of movie goers.James McAvoy, once again was simply phenomenal, portraying the diverse array of characters with immense acting ability and flair, even having the opportunity to add even more to his already impressive resume in Split. The charismatic Scotsman played an influx of convincing characters all sharing the same physical brain as the original personality, Kevin Wendell Crumb, a broken boy from an abusive home. I believe McAvoy deserved every acting award on the planet for this performance, but his lack of recognition just goes to show how biased and out of touch these large award promotions are.Samuel L. Jackson returns to the role of disturbed mass murdering former comic book store owner Elijah Price (AKA Glass) almost 19 years later. As a huge Jackson admirer, I have to say, one of his strongest characters and performances was in Unbreakable (another Shyamalan picture to be snubbed by critics and award bodies alike). This movie starts slow for the title character, seemingly in a sedated, trance like state in the psychiatric hospital David Dunn (Willis) left him in at the end of the original film. Slowly as we get further into the picture we realise there is more to this, and Price is actually playing up his mental state to appear unthreatening. He is the mastermind and the title character, truly done justice to in this movie.Bruce Willis returns to his role of David Dunn, first (and last) seen in the aforementioned Unbreakable. We find out his wife (Robin Wright) has passed away and his son Joseph, now grown up, is helping him with the hero business. It starts where Split ended, Dunn (now dubbed the Overseer) wary of the Horde (McAvoy), tries to find him and put a stop to the abductions of young women. He succeeds and finds him at an old factory they have a relatively well made fight scene, culminating in them spilling into the streets and Sarah Paulsons Dr. Ellie Staple, (with an armed militia) imploring Dunn to surrender (which he reluctantly does). She then admits both Dunn and the Horde to the same psychiatric hospital Elijah Price is already inhabiting.Now we have some of the strongest and believable writing which I truly admire. We see Ellie Sharpe try to break down the lead characters and convince them they're not actually superheroes. I believe the idea of this portion is truly believable and what would actually happen if people like this existed. She tries to explain away everything the Horde and David do, actually convincing them they're not special. David is the first to break of course, considering for the majority of Unbreakable he didn't even want to believe he was a hero. Patricia (the personality that prophesied the beast strongest in Split) even started to doubt whether the Beast was actually as strong as she thought, which was sad and I think led to the audience questioning it too. I feel like this portion could've been executed better and there are flaws but the general idea of it is very clever and I'm a big fan.Now the ending, the real problem I have with this film. I can see what the director/writer was going for, and I can appreciate it, the twist ending. However, I don't feel like this movie earned it, I don't feel like (big spoiler) McAvoy and Willis' deaths were necessary. Dunn I feel was poorly treated in this movie. The titular referenced hero of Unbreakable, just gets casually killed off by his Kryptonite (drowned by water) in a scene which had no build up and felt like it was just done for shock value. The same applies to The Horde. If you're looking at this film as a sequel to Split, I feel it is poor. With how Split ends you would imagine McAvoy would end up dying at the end of the sequel, however you would think that would be done in more of a dramatic way, after he's killed too many innocent girls, as the main villain. He wasn't even the main villain in this film, and his death just felt unnecessary. Anya Taylor-Joy was I believe heavily under-utilised in this film after how much of a great, interesting character she played in Split. In the end she was only really there to bring Kevin Wendell Crumb into the light so that he could be unnecessarily shot and killed.In the end learn that Sarah Paulsons character works for some institution which prevents the public from knowing about superheroes and she needed to get rid of Dunn only because McAvoys character presented himself. Why couldn't they have just put them back in the mental institution? This just felt so unnecessary to me.I understand it is called Glass and predominantly Elijah Price aka Glass' story. I just feel like the ending could've been better handled. Yes he got what he wanted and the world found out about superheroes, I just don't think Willis and McAvoy needed to die. I'm fine with Glass dying, I felt like that was beautiful and made sense in the story. If everything else worked out the same way apart from the other 2 dying this would've been a 9/10 for me and on the same level as the first 2, maybe even better.",Glass

I mostly succeeded although I had read some reviews (""normal people"" user reviews - not the useless professional critics' reviews). Some user reviews gave me the impression that there was a fantastic major twist at the end that's bigger than Sixth Sense. Yes, there was a twist at the end but not quite at Sixth Sense levels. Still it was a nice twist.Overall the movie had great veteran actors in the 3 main ""superhero"" parts who all gave very good performances for their parts - James McAvoy, Bruce Willis and Samuel L Jackson. You'd expect that, and you got that. Their performances held the movie up. The movie itself - without giving anything away - wasn't as ""twisty"" as I expected but it does keep you on edge due to the tenseness of all the characters, particularly McAvoy's ""Split"" character.In the end I did get the similar feeling I got when I watched Unbreakable. (I haven't watched Split yet). It was OK satisfying but not over the top. I think the problem M. Night Shyamalan is that Sixth Sense was so extraordinary that it is very hard for him to top that. Overall, it's a reasonably satisfying movie, but I felt that I wanted more fleshed out. Personally, I give it a 6/10",Glass

819,alexisbessonmackain,highly underrated,10,9 June 2019,"Initially, when i saw the reviews on glass, i was questioning whether to see it or not. Eventually, i decided to do so about 2 or 3 months ago. i am a huge fan off unbreakable which i consider to be Bruce Willis's best character and performance as well as the way it uses comic books(which i do not read by the way,all of my knowledge of superheroes comes from movies) in its storyline to present the relationship between David Dunn and Elijah Price. Split while i did not enjoy it as much, i still thought it was also an excellent film with james mcavoy giving a truly unique and terrific performance as a man with multiple personalities.now onto the main film itself:pros:
terrific acting and characters, with james mcavoy always being the scene stealer of this series.
pretty good action scenes that unlike some other superhero films do not feel overblown.
the use of flashbacks were terrific in linking back to the previous films and giving us a few extra scenes with david dunn too.
The idea that superheroes might only exist due to their own delusions and tragic lives is an interesting question raised in this film that can be applied to all other superheroes too
musical score is pretty good too, although i do miss james newton howard and his score in unbreakable.
and finally, i thought that the final revelation concerning sarah paulson's character working for a mysterious organisation that wants superheroes gone is a bit clichéd but for me it works as this organisation is not defined and could be anything we(the members of the audience) want it to be and final ending leaves a lot of potential for exploration as to how people would truly respond to superheroes.overall, i would rank this as my favorite superhero film of 2019 and the best ending to a superhero trilogy ever. and I will miss you, David Dunn, Elijah Price and Kevin Wendell Crumb as you all were just trying to find your place in the world only for it to be taken away.",Glass

Kevin being shot with one bullet, in the pancreas or the kidney is just lazy.The main problem I had with this film was the feeling that it left off with more of a future, when the viewers know that there will be only the trilogy.

Some of the performances are commendable, in particular James McAvoy, who takes a deserved centre-stage in Glass. We see more of his personas than we did in Split, which works in the films favour, as this provides much of the entertainment. However, the movie almost feels too full. There are so many characters that many find themselves with nothing to do, in no way serving the plot. While Anya-Taylor Joy's performance is solid, it feels wholly unnecessary, almost like Shyamalan felt pressured to include her in the plot. Like with Unbreakable, my main issue is with the plot and pacing, both of which are very weak. If not for the talent of some of these actors, it could have turned out a complete mess.

I'm a fan of his cinematography, the low angles, the in-your-face camera, the colors he uses and several other aspects. And no, i'm not a ""critic"", just someone who appreciates good directing, and Shyamalan is for sure a talent.
Having said that, and having followed the prequels, he had a brilliant set of actors in his hands, brilliant characters, he wrote and directed the films, so there should be no possible excuse for a ""meh"" movie, which i highly anticipated since Split, which hinted at the trilogy (you didn't know it on Unbreakable, so it must have been written along the years, as he was writing other screenplays.
WHO is and WHERE does Sarah Paulson come from? And WHY? Just for the ""sake of unmasking superheroes""? Ok, i'll play. WHY does an asylum have a handful of patients, 3 or 4 staffers, NO security apart from the staffers? HOW can Glass walk around, do whatever he wants to, play with meds, etc, if ""there are 100 cameras, looking at everywhere he can look at""? And he only talks the last section of the film, which was also disappointing (there could have been ways to explore the fact that his mind is intact without mixing it all up nonsensically in a brief ""Mission Impossible-like"" sequence. The whole ""light"" character is messy, and totally contrary to Split at times. Willis doesn't talk, basically, just sits there and listens to babbling theories by Paulsen. Since Jackson hardly talks as well, the film is basically (and kudos to MacAvoy for his brilliant part(s)) about the ""Monster"" and the other identities.
All the promises made in the film are broken in the end, and even though it's ""not supposed"" to be a ""Superhero"" movie (according to some ""hardcore fans"" (lol), EVEN Jackson says it is so. ""It's an Origins story"".
Except that, unless Shyamalan starts a new twist to it all, it would have been stories about extraordinary people who die stupidly, without ANY emotion between them, without any kind of REAL back story, other than the one provided in brief sequences.
These plot holes are just the ones i spotted viewing the film ONCE, and tired, at that...

836,amr_gamal_91,Shaymalane is a unique twisted mind director,7,11 February 2019,"Glass is a solid 7 , glass is a superhero movie with no hero just 3 humain beings with good and bad sides showing the most desirable thing by hero being shown and praised by the world , the movie is bit slow in the middle , acting is good and bringing all the main characters from the original unbreakable including bruce willis son makes everything in its place , however the movie could have been better if it taken one or 2 years more to be devolped but yet i understand the timing as 80 percent of people watching this movie cause they watched split recently so for money wise it is perfect timing for the movie but in my opinion if the script was more devoloped and took more time keeping the same formidable twist in this movie , Glass would be even better than split and unbreakable",Glass
837,Leethal1,??? Strange!! ??,3,6 April 2019,"That was really bizarre...
I was enjoying it up until half way through and then the feces hit the fan. I have defended M Night in the past. But this time I felt my blood boiling as every scene become abstract and disjointed. I get that now there was a 'point' to all of the choppy editing, but it didn't pay off. And like what another reviewer said David Dunn's death was heinous.
great acting though. ***",Glass
838,jacman2084,Only M.Night can do this.,7,15 August 2020,"Only he can make a movie look good and bad at the same time.I was really impressed with the ending. How he wanted the story to go the way he wanted rather than a ""usual show down"" on the rooftop of the tallest building in town.I liked how the movie played with my mind, asking questions like ""are they really what they claim to be?"". He even used some clever connections to the previous movies to sow that seed of doubt in our minds.I liked what Elijah did. All 3 actors delivered good performances. It was a good movie.For me, the best among all 3.Then how could he make it bad? By bringing in unnatural emotions at various points of the film.I felt edgy where I saw a guard turning the lights on and off out of fear (if it was for teasing, it would've made more sense).I felt confused when ""the beast"" had to controlled in a ""hulk like"" manner through another character. What if she never had plans to come back to the story? He should've used David to bring the beast to submission.There are other moments like these where we feel the things that are happening may not be necessary to the film. For example, some big revelation and connection to some comic book story as found by Anna. I mean that's the whole point here, so why include that scene?But I do want to give credit for the director. He spend 19 years in the making of this trilogy and he did it his way.Nothing was added for glamor, no gimmicks (he could've cashed in and made into a superhero fantasy movie if he wanted to). It's a good trilogy in that aspect.I'd rate it 7 out if 10.",Glass

840,drmnc1,Shyamalan continues to break the mould with his final installment of an inspired trilogy,8,18 January 2019,"I can't remember the last time I felt so hyped up about a film as I was for Glass. I don't quite know why, because I knew it would never be perfect. Perhaps it was because in the past 5 years we have been inundated with a deluge of superhero films that we are literally drowning in them. I knew that Glass was going to be a real mould-breaker, just like Unbreakable was before it (even though it came out in 2000, before the age of Marvel really kicked in). I liked Unbreakable, and loved Split, which I only just saw recently.I enjoyed the whole theme that explored questioning whether our three main characters have superpowers, or whether it is all their own delusions, especially given how grounded the other two films were, and Mr Glass's own brand of mad was, it certainly is an area the film somehow succeeds in making quite grey.Superpowers or not, James McAvoy certainly pulls off a superpowers performance, playing even more personalities in this film and is truly a feat of acting to be able to transition so seamlessly from one to the other in a single scene. Samuel L. Jackson is having the time of his life playing the eponymous Mr. Glass, who must surely have cemented himself now alongside the Joker as one of the most memorable supervillains of all time; Bruce Willis is just okay, although he doesn't really get much to work with. Of course, the other two characters have a much more magnetic personality than the everyman David Dunn, but I still felt like he was getting short-changed.I don't agree with how it got treated by the critics; the 'expectation' is to see loads of big setpieces, long action scenes and world-ending threats, and if that's what you are expecting to see going into the film, then you are clearly not the right audience for the film. That's what I would say. And with cinema now saturated with superhero films, this is what people have come to expect, and slam Glass because it's not that, which is a shame.One criticism I have though is I'm not convinced about the ending. Another 'Shyamalan twist' that he's famous for - but it didn't leave me 100% satisfied. It's not a sort of twist that ruins the film completely though; it does make some sense, just not what I would have gone for.Anyway, I'd recommend it! It explores some interesting themes rather than all the generic ones we see today about love and responsibility and all of that, the questions run so much deeper, it manages to be quite nuanced, despite the clumsy ending. Go and see it! It definitely makes a change from Marvel (though admittedly their films have become less formulaic in recent years, which is a good thing) and probably more of a psychological thriller than an action film. I would actually go as far as to say the opposite. I think that the new age of superhero films have really helped Unbreakable, and now Glass, stand out from the crowd.",Glass
841,cranium889,"Glass is a fine movie on its own, but as the final chapter in an amazing trilogy, it's a masterpiece.",8,18 January 2019,"GLASS is a fitting & logical conclusion to the Eastrail 177 Trilogy that started with UNBREAKABLE. It may seem underwhelming to some, but it's the right way to wrap everything up. If you haven't seen previews for the movie, it will be an awesome spectacle. If you have seen previews, then most of the action has been spoiled, and all that will be new is exposition & twists.
If you're expecting a ton of action, then you're forgetting that this movie is about its eponymous character, The Mastermind, first name: Mister, last name: Glass. This isn't about punching, but about the work of a genius. Keeping that in mind, the movie becomes a work of genius, itself.
Being an M. Night, flick, there are some great twists & shocking reveals. None of them are contrived or tacked on, but are quite satisfying. And even if this isn't as flashy as Marvel & DC movies, this is probably the truest comic book movie there is, at least at their purest sense.
Acting wise, James McAvoy is the only one given anything to do and he chews the hell out of the scenery. Considering most of the movie is rather slow, he is what keeps you entertained throughout. The man is a formidable talent and deserves all the movie roles (which he could literally pull off).
All in all, Glass is a fine movie on its own, but as the final chapter in an amazing trilogy, it's a masterpiece.",Glass

It was very boring that i almost fell asleep.
could have a better ending .",Glass
845,garciarichard,Not for the faint of mind,8,7 April 2019,"Much of the discontent towards this film arises from the fact that it is marketed as an action thriller, when it is a psychological film about a man who orchestrates situations to achieve a desired outcome.The first twenty minutes of Glass builds up as a crossover sequel to Unbreakable and Split, following the exploits of Kevin Wendell Crumb/The Horde (played by James McAvoy) and David Dunn/The Overseer (played by Bruce Willis) and their brief confrontation in an abandoned factory where a group of abducted girls are held hostage, only for the narrative to take a complete turn when a psychiatrist reveals herself and has the authorities lock up the two men in a mental institution.From here we are reintroduced to Elijah Price/Mr. Glass (played by Samuel L. Jackson), the ACTUAL protagonist and friend-turned-foe of David Dunn from Unbreakable. Elijah Price is a mass killer obsessed with comic books who employs terrorist methods to awaken what he perceives to be latent abilities in gifted individuals.And his story is more of a cat-and-mouse game in which he tries to outwit psychiatrist Dr. Ellie Staple (played by Sarah Paulson), who is part of a secret society that monitors, pacifies, and eliminates exceptional individuals, and her attempts to gaslight the three main leads into believing that they don't have superhuman abilities.Glass eventually builds to a climax between The Overseer and The Horde, and an unexpected plot twist which angered many moviegoers, although Price achieves his goal of revealing the existence of superhuman individuals to the world. Personally, I enjoyed it for the ideas it tries to convey and the very limited budget M. Night Shyamalan had to work with.Because Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson are renowned Hollywood actors with very expensive salaries, their roles in this film were relatively short to accommodate it's small budget. Although James McAvoy hammed it up brilliantly with his portrayal of an abuse victim with split personalities who manifests a cannibalistic persona in the form of The Beast.",Glass
846,HorrorMaster-13,Don't influence yourself by the Reviews on Sites like Rotten Tomatoes or Metacritic. Build your own opinion and watch the movie.,7,18 January 2019,"Glass is a really difficult movie to write a Review about.
I am a huge Fan of Unbreakable (2000). It is not only one of the best Superhero Movies ever made but also one of my favorite Movies and in my opinion M. Night Shyamalan's Best Movie. Yes, I found it better than The Sixth Sense (1999). It also has one of my favorite Scores composed by James Newton Howard.
After that movie M. Night Shyamalan became a Hit and Miss Director, mostly Miss. In 2017 he finally got his Comeback with a very successful movie called Split that was (Spoiler Alert!) a secret Sequel to Unbreakable (2000) and gave M. Night Shyamalan an opportunity to make a third and final Installment called 'Glass' to his Unbreakable/Split Trilogy. To say that I was excited about this Movie is an Understatement. After watching it yesterday I needed time to processing it so here is my opinion.
Glass is a good movie that has its fair share of flaws. To not go into details I would say that as an Unbreakable Sequel, Glass is a bit disappointing but as an Sequel to Split it is quite an improvement for me because if I'm being honest I am not a huge Fan of Split.
I don't get the negative Reviews that Glass gets. I mean yes, it has some problems, the 3rd Act to be more specific, but I don't agree with people that called it a Bad Movie.
The Ending of Glass in particular is the only thing that really, really frustrates me. I hated half of the Ending but I loved the other half.In a nutshell this movie is a 7/10 for me. It's better than Split but not even close to be as amazing as Unbreakable (2000).",Glass

851,sirharksalot,Very enjoyable though not as impactful as it should've been.,7,5 May 2019,"Glass is a very interesting movie that combines the characters from Unbreakable and Split into one movie revolving around Superheros in the real world. All of their condition could technically be real and that is played with by M Night. Could all of their ""powers"" actually be mental illnesses?The movie seems to focus too much on expanding what we have seen before and not adding anything new. James McAvoy is great once again though there is nothing we haven't seen before in Split and I believe that it is M Night's fault sadly. Bruce Willis is out hunting those he believes are deserving to be hunted though his performance is not too special. Samuel L Jackson is a highlight as he has gone through some change being locked up for so many years.The setting helps the film and lets it focus on the characters. I thought the hyping up of the final act being on the new tower was great and it showed that it was not a typical superhero movie with a giant climax.The end twist was fun but not that impactful. The superheros ARE real and there is a secret organization working in quiet to eliminate them. This includes bringing them into a mental asylum to convince them that they are just crazy. When this does not work, it comes down to killing them all. However, this is not important because they failed. The fact that everything is now recorded in our age comes into play here. No giant event like this will stay a secret any longer. The three main side characters then gather to spread the word that superheros ARE real. There is a nice message here regarding what really makes a person super.It was very enjoyable though.

In Glass the main characters are confined in an institution for special people, they're threated by Dr Ellie Staple.
Glass is an intriguing movie, it does something different in the superhero genre. It's more like a drama than a superhero movie actually.
The directing is good, Shyamalan creates very well the tension and the suspense. The script is very simple but it works, it focuses mainly in the characters than the story. The characters are very interesting though, and the script makes them understandable and relatable, they all are very human even if they have ""powers"" they also have week points.
The cast in here is great, mainly James McAvoy who plays 23 different characters.
The negative aspects in the movie, were that the character of Casey does not make sense to be in here. There is an effective reason why she is on the movie, but after the events of Split there is no reason. When you watched it you will understand. There is also excessive talks about comicbooks to make the parallel because they're heroes, but it becames too excessive.

With strong acting, the signature Shyamalan score, as little to none CGI use, and clever as always story telling, this movie keeps your attention from start to finish.My review is more in defense of this film considering the low ratings it has received which I don't believe it's deserving of. In a time when originality is lacking, Shyamalan can always be trusted to bring a breath of fresh air into cinema, and with Glass he does just that.Final note: M Night Shyamalan is one of the greatest writer/directors out in cinematic history, and it's time to realize this instead of following this hateful trend.",Glass

Shyamalan, is one the victim of modernisation where he tries to captivate you with an original idea and then critics in general disregard him by saying he is ""trying too much"". Shyamalan is beloved by his audiences and to be honest his fans has never give up on his talent. That is the reason why his films survive and loved in later years.
So when I talk about Glass, it can proudly say that this film is a profound experience. Beautifully crafted and very well written as it keeps you challenging with the ideologies of Heroes and Villains. Are they for real? Or its just a made up idea to keep us politically motivated. This film brings so many metaphors to life, you can completely understand what Shyamalan is trying to do.
Yes, this film is not for modern superheroes fans. I love comic book movies but this is something that has its outer dimensions in thoughtfulness.

McAvoy is the show stealer just as he was in Split, Sam Jackson is, once he gets started, just great to watch and Bruce Willis, arguably in a more minor role, brings a better performance this his most recent body of work suggests he can.

883,boldeboy,Brief But Honest Opinion,2,19 January 2019,"This movie was terrible!!! It was senseless and anti climactic. Everything felt forced. The hero, the villain, the impressionable, all of it. The movie left nothing memorable. This was a missed opportunity. It could have been great, like really could have.. It wasn't even ""decent."" They would of been better making a Split 2 and making a separate movie for Glass and it's characters. Nothing about the movie except my own expectations, captivated me. You love all the characters obviously, but that's because of the movies prior, there's nothing in this movie to continue that warm feeling towards them. The movie had a few chuckle worthy scenes, all done by a 9 year old boy (inside joke) but aside from that, it was a one star movie. If your a fan of the movies prior, go see it for closure or wait for retail release. But, of your looking to be entertained, this isn't going to help much.",Glass

I have seen reports that this movie would tie everything up, and that this movie would end the story of all the characters. Mind you that every character in this movie was fantastic, but the story was a bit open ended.The way the movie starts gets you excited to what comes. I was very pleased with the character development in each of the main cast. I just want to know why we have a conclusion that feels like it is just the beginning. Maybe we will get more from this story later on down the road.I want everyone reading this to know I am not revealing too much because I wanted to see the movie for myself. I will say this was a good movie, not a GREAT movie, but a good one. Ignore the criticism that the movie is getting. Test it out, and you might get for more than you bargained for. In theory, you might be leaving the movie with questions. Hey, don't knock it till you try it.",Glass
885,Francesco_Adam,I loved it. It's different. But I loved it.,9,11 February 2019,"I loved it. It's different. But I loved it.James McAvoy! The man is truly one of the best actors of our time. He is just fantastic to watch on screen, shifting and splitting between all his different characters and personalities/ identities. He basically steals the entire show.Bruce Willis. One of my all time favorite actors. He feels very present in this role. I loved being able to see Willis not just return as David Dunn but see his continuation.Samuel L. Jackson, always cool and always great. He returns as Mr Glass and while I would say he has the least amount of screen time of the three leads, he owns every scene he is in.Anya Taylor-Joy and Spencer Treat Clark return in supporting roles and while they are only in supporting roles, it really feels right to have them as part of the ensemble for this third and final film.The story, the tone of the film, the characters, the actors. The technical talent, all of it was so great. I loved the camera work, the cinematography. West Dylan Thordson returns from SPLIT to score GLASS, he finds a way to really capture the shifting tones and emotions of the film.For me this movie is what I wanted it to be and more. It delivers on certain story beats and action beats that had my freaking out in my seat. It also equally took turns in directions that I was not expecting but I was on board for.I can see this film having multiple reactions from audiences and fans of this Unbreakable/ Split. And I can see why. My only complaint is the movie ends. I would have gladly watch a three and a half cut of this.Definitely would recommend.
Its a must see for Unbreakable and Split fans. If you haven't see either films... you should, then go check out Glass!",Glass
886,abgraham11,Under Appreciated,8,28 January 2019,"I believe the film critics have a collective bias against M. Night Shyamalan.

It ties the other two films together with this one quite well and wraps them up as well. Don't be put off by the critics.",Glass
887,jetmoviereviews,Not a TOTAL train wreck...,7,21 January 2019,"Here it is, folks... the third movie in a trilogy that no one saw coming. A trilogy written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan, a man of many talents, who has had some hits and some misses. Some very large misses. But that doesn't go without saying that this man has major skills, from both the writing and directing stand-points. Since Unbreakable was a movie that I really liked and Split was a surprisingly good movie that surprisingly tied into Unbreakable, it's no surprise that I was looking forward to Glass. Wow, I used surprise way too much in that sentence.
I was hyped for this movie. Now, listen kids. Riding the hype train is risky business. Sometimes you will end up like David Dunn, completely unbroken and unphased (which is a good thing). Other times, you'll just end up like the rest of the passengers on David's train... dead, but on the inside. So, is Glass any good? Or did Manoj Night Shyamalan once again let his fans down? The verdict is... it's okay.
It's not the best Shyamalan film, and is most definitely the worst in his superhero trilogy. But, this movie is not a total train wreck. There is a lot to love. All of the actors in this movie do an amazing job. Even Bruce Willis, who has been known for not really putting a lot in to the movies he's been starring in. In this movie, it really feels like Bruce enjoys playing the character of David Dunn. James McAvoy does an amazing job, once again, as Kevin Wendell Crumb and his other personalities. Samuel L. Jackson is still terrifying as Mr. Glass. Sarah Paulson was pretty good, too.
Shyamalan does a great job writing and directing. You can tell that he loves this movie and that he wanted to do a lot with it. This movie follows Unbreakable's traits of not being a typical superhero movie, which is sort of a relief in this day and age. It includes scenes from Unbreakable, including a deleted scene from the 2000 movie that was included in this one. It also takes some horror elements from Split. So, there is a nice mixture here. I am glad this wasn't a full on action movie, too. It kept the same feel as Unbreakable. There was action at the end, which was fun to see, since we hadn't really been able to see David Dunn's powers in action before. Yet, it wasn't full blown action. This is a character piece, just like Unbreakable and Split.
The problems I have with the film come from the fact that while this movie is titled Glass, Mr. Glass (Elijah Price) and David Dunn almost feel sidelined. This feels more like a movie for Kevin, or the Horde, which is disappointing because this was advertised as an Unbreakable sequel. It still is, yet it doesn't feel like a good ending to complete the trilogy. Shyamalan wanted to conclude Dunn's, Kevin's, and Price's stories all in one movie, and it just felt like too much sometimes. I won't get into spoilers, but a lot of the events that happen in the end just didn't do it for me. I did think, however, that the main big twist was smart.
This is a smart movie; don't get me wrong. Shyamalan is a great writer with many ideas. Sadly, he has many ideas that he likes to throw into one movie, which doesn't always work. This is not a bad movie at all. It just feels like he had so many things he wanted to do, but couldn't decide which ones to cut... so he didn't cut any. This movie was disappointing, but is not terrible at all. While it might not be the Unbreakable sequel I wanted, it is still a decent movie none the less.",Glass
888,hridhik,"Uninspiring end to the superhero trilogy we never needed , but deserved so much",7,16 June 2019,"Short review: Going into this movie , if you were expecting an Unbreakable sequel , like I was , you'll be a tad bit dissapointed. Great moments and fantastic acting ( give a fing Oscar to James McAvoy already ) filled in an uneven paced psychological movie but with a very unsatisfying end.Long version :
I have the weirdest relationship with M Night Shyamalan movies . I mean , we all have. Dude makes a masterpiece of a movie like The Sixth Sense , then creates abominations like The Airbender ( seriously wtf?) . Even tho I respect his ideas of having the balls to do something different in every movie of his , it doesn't always work out does it?
I have clearly never been the most biggest fan of Shyamalan's work , but Unbreakable is definitely one of the most underrated superhero origin movies (yes superhero) of all time and is a masterpiece and Split , which was surprisingly a supervillain origin story was a brilliant psychological thriller.
The movie starts out with Dunn doing superhero work ( something I looked forward to after the first movie) and conflicting with Kevin and getting caught and hence being placed in a facility , with also Mr.Glass and that's your movie basically.
Even though James McAvoy carries the movie when he's on screen , the unevenness of Dunn's character and his plain arc with getting sidelined most of the movie confused me. Should've given something more to his character than we've seen before. Samuel LJackson doesn't do anything for like an hour but when he starts getting into the movie , he's fantastic, menacing and a thrill to watch.
The score from Unbreakable which was so brilliant , wasn't there in this movie enough which kinda bummed me out cuz I was looking forward to it. And the end was dissapointing to say the least , atleast for me. I felt there could've been so many other routes they could've taken these characters to , especially after developing them throught two straight movies and making them so interesting , surely there would've been better ways to finish their arc rather than finishing them off by an organisation who had never been developed in the movies before ( Bruce will dying was hilarious and kinda took me off the movie )
When you really think about it , the hero kinda fails miserably at the end and the villain, a mass murdering terrorist , ends up fulfilling his mission lolSummary : Good watch , doesn't pay off , but the acting , the first two acts and some incredible moments in between , makes it worth your money",Glass
889,hasnarb,"Weak build up, satisfactory finish.",6,19 January 2019,"The movie started off weakly and the entirety of the plot was more or less bland. Predictable and flat. The main characters met after an attempt of kidnapping before they're then caught by the police. They're then detained in a mental hospital with a psychiatrist who thinks that they're somehow mentally sick for believing that they're some sort of individuals with extraordinary abilities so that they have to undergo tests, interviews and so on; it's all easy to guess what's going to happen next.The first half of the movie was so boring that I almost fell asleep. There are too many things going on and not all of them makes sense, even when I try hard to fit all the puzzles. So there are plot holes here and there, although it wasn't too significant. But then the movie builds up a little bit tense towards the end. And this is where it gets a tad bit more interesting. The ending leaves me satisfied, it pays for what the beginning of the movie did to me.I cannot disagree with a tint of amusement I'm feeling with the actors who are able to portray such amazing characters, especially James McAvoy. But the weak story does no justice to their portrayals.In conclusion, this was just a mediocre finish of the trilogy. Not bad, but it's really not good either. Five stars for leaving me a little satisfied.",Glass
890,davibentim,"Disappointing, unfulfilling and badly executed.",5,30 January 2019,"spoiler alert - no specific spoilers but context may give away some things -Well, as someone who loved Unbreakable and Split, this was very unsatisfying. I'll be fair and make it clear that it isn't because of the sudden twist in the end which leaves wondering what the hell you just watched. Shyamalan's movies are usually full of twists so you'd expect that. Anyhow, the problem were the several plot holes, a few minors and a few majors; the poor cinematography with the constant POV which I believe were meant to immerse the viewer but all it did for me was the opposite; the very poor writing with cliché bad nurse who abuses impaired patients, repetitive and unnecessary dialogue; badly directed and hardly believable fight scenes and some other directing issues.James McAvoy is amazing. Not as good as in Split, mostly due to a rushed writing and sense of overusing of his personalities, but still very impressive performance. Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson also disappointed me, with below their average of performances. Bruce's fight moves were stiff and hard to buy, but I get it, he's old. Samuel L. Jackson's twitching is also hardly believable and had an unimpressive performance, but not bad. Just less than what I'm used to from him.As for the plot, it felt like shallow, overcomplicated attempt to bring something new to the table of superhero movies. It falls very short of the grace and smoothness of the plot of Unbreakable and puts a very unforgiving and unsatisfying end to a series of movies we weren't aware before that were connected.To certain degree, I enjoyed my experience with Glass. Most of the things that bothered were about the directing and writing. Would I watch it again? Maybe one day. Open your mind and expect much less than Unbreakable and Split and you will have a decent time",Glass

Bruce Willis was good on his part. Although his character was given less screen time. Samuel L. Jackson is also great.
As we know M. Night Shyamalan is famous for his endings, here also you will get to see his touch. Although one drawback of the movie was the fight scenes which could have been more better. The fight scenes are very short.

907,Phoneutria-03,Great End.,9,28 May 2021,"In 2000 when the masterpiece 'Unbreakable' was made the director, M. Night Shyamalan wasn't as popular as he is now, including his movies. Meaning that nobody really were into those kind of movies as they were, incidentally, based on the idea of superhereos. Only did the topic gain popularity around 2015- 2016 as this was the time that Marvel and DC movies grew into the lime light. 2016 was when we realised we could bring back the series in 'Split'. A few years later 2019 we come to the movie that ends the trilogy 'Glass'.I believe that this movie is the corrct way to end this, Samuel L. Jackson's charcter Mr. Glass, wanted to prove that superheroes truly exist, even if there were special people designed to stop them. The aim of the plan was to remove trace of all superhero species, for them to not to be superior to others. Were as Mr. Glass's plan was cleverly set up to dodge every bullet they throw at him, but i guess you'll just have to watch the movie.P. S. Make sure you watch Split and Unbreakable before wating this otherwise you won't get it at all.",Glass
908,MikaHaeli8,What. Just. What.,4,21 January 2019,"I saw it last night with the boyfriend, who was REALLY excited to see this, given that he loves ""Unbreakable"" and ""Split"". Hell, we watched those two before catching our showing in the evening.This was what the kids call 'a bad idea'.Positives: The score is really good and there are some intentionally funny parts, such as Hedwig giving the camera the middle finger from offscreen (mostly). The first hour overall is entertaining, fills us in nicely about what David Dunn's been up to over the last 19yrs without going overboard with it (i.e. spending too much time on it), and the titular Mr. Glass's stay in the psych hospital and how things work around there. It brings the three together really quickly and really well. Speaking of the characters, the performances are great, especially McAvoy, who cycles between the personalities as effortlessly as he did in ""Split"".Speaking of Kevin... siiiiggghhh. ""Split"" managed to not make him cartoon-y. ""Glass"" does. We (the boyfriend and I) could tell who had and hadn't seen ""Split"" by their reactions to Patricia in the opening few minutes, and there were quite a few laughs from the audience. And the handling of Kevin/The Horde wasn't the only cock-up on Shyamalan's part. The car park showdown was awful (Shyamalan is NOT an action director at ALL), David Dunn's death was horribly undignified - David in general deserved better - and the ""secret society"" twist came out of nowhere and served no purpose, not just to the film, but the trilogy in general. The constant meta was grinding as all get out by the end (""and here's the showdown!""), and I felt absolutely no engagement with the film whatsoever. It serves as a crap conclusion to a decent trilogy, and an insult to the previous two films.And to those who complain about the critics and how wrong they are: they are paid to assess how well-made a film is, not because of who's in it, the genre, or who's directed it, as the general public do. Most of the critics think that this film is bad. You don't have to agree with them, but you do have to recognise the purpose of their job, and disagreement does not mean that either of you are wrong.

The fresh perspective and director's divisive take on humans reacting to superheros or basically over powered humans(The same theme that was dealt in BvS)gave me chills. Just when you believe its all over, everything changes. Let's not even get into acting or trivial stuff which we know already gonna be great. There's not one passable moment, but there are couple of ""well, that's convenient"" moments. Cinematography and colour schemes are excellent.A little-flawed masterpiece.",Glass
922,john_titmus,Worth Seeing Just For Mcavoys performance alone.,6,16 May 2019,First off the story isn't exactly solid with a weak disappointing anti climatic ending but James Mcavoys performance carries this film with ease. Sam L Jackson and Sarah Paulson do there part and put in solid performances.The only 3 things that really stood out as being wrong were The obligatory cameo by M Night which was pointless and kind of shameful. The music composer who seemed to poorly imitate Joseph Bisharas orchestral tension backing music from insidious. The makeup given to Mr Glass mother makes her look a cross between a sex doll and a Wallace and gromit character. I know Sam L Jackson is actually older than the woman playing his mom but she looks really weird.,Glass

924,aiqbal66,"Starts off great, gets progressively worse, and ends with a jaw-droppingly bad ending.",2,27 January 2019,"I was looking forward to Glass as Unbreakable was one of my all-time favorite films. Despite the bad reviews, I decided to see it anyway. Things start out well enough where we see what David Dunn has been up to since Unbreakable and things move pretty quickly to setup a confrontation with David and the Horde which ends in the two men being apprehended by the police and admitted into a psychiatric hospital. After that, things start to go south starting with one of the most annoying characters I can remember on film; this being the psychiatrist who thinks these men are having delusions of grandeur (putting aside the fact that there is more than enough evidence on hand that these are not delusions). The Mister Glass scenes are interesting in the asylum but I wasn't impressed with the Horde multiple personalities. All the setup leads to a showdown between Horde and Dunn orchestrated by Mister Glass. If this movie ended here, it would've been a decent movie, but it takes a bad turn where the psychiatrist is part of secret organization that doesn't want people to know superheroes exist. They end up killing all three men (Dunn gets drowned in a pothole of water! LOL) and deleting all the footage of their powers in action. Ah, but Mister Glass live streamed everything to a private server and is later deployed everywhere so the whole world knows about the existence of superheroes. Part of the problem with this is that the footage released can be made pretty easily with kids who know how to use Adobe Premiere.As a side-note, movie editing seems to have become a lost art. This movie could have easily been 30 minutes shorter.",Glass
925,chak-anurag,Amazing satisfying finale to the Unbreakable trilogy,9,18 January 2019,"This is a spoiler free review below.
This movie is an amazing and perfect finale of the Unbreakable trilogy series created by M.Night Shyamalan. It is undeniably advisable to watch/ be aware of the first 2 installments of this trilogy, because only then this movie can be appreciated or understood.
The writing of Shyamalan is absolutely so commendable in this movie, because the essence of this new genre of movie series that he has created takes it's best form in this movie. In this movie he very skillfully balances the portrayal of depicting the typical comic book genre of story telling, mixed with typical mystery thriller narration with the final distinctive signature style of Shyamalan of concluding with an uncommon albeit intriguing ending. All those familiar with his other movies can relate to this.
So in a nutshell, all comic book fans and thriller movie seekers should definitely watch this movie for its realistic appeal and the Remaining other Shyamalan fans should rush to watch this movie to experience this awesome finale !.👌
Rating 9 out of 10.",Glass

1)couple of the fight scenes was the actor fighting a camera and it looked crap

Otherwise, the script was very weak and not entertaining.

And I am not one to need a lot of action, but actually like surprising plot twists which Shyamalan seems to always deliver, but this one was not very interesting in the least to me.",Glass

929,stefanlos,Come in with a open mind,7,19 January 2019,"Yes it is messy and yes the rotten tomatoe score is vary low. However when this movie works it really works. James Macovoy gives a great performance Samuel L Jackson provides his typical level of charisma to his character and Bruce Willis exhibits one of his best performances that he has given in a long while. The music and cinematography was top notch and the ending is vary bold and bittersweet. Some criticisms thrown at the film are vary valid when it comes to the continuity of certain things and the rushed aspects of other thing, however many of the complaints being thrown at the film tend to bug me because its obvious that the naysayers wanted more of a stereotypical and cliche conclusion with a big action set peace to bring it all home , but yet they forget to remember that Unbreakable as a film was vary different with its depiction of superheroes compared to other films in that genre. This series of films was trying to be the anti superhero movie series and because of this, things need to be subverted in order to ground it in reality. I dug this film and really the reason why this isn't a higher score is because of some nit picky things here and there. Plus things that are a little too convenient for there own good. However the pros for me out way the cons and I highly recommend this film if your looking for a superhero movie that is vary different from the flock seek this one out.",Glass
930,conn-57441,Don't believe the critics!,8,17 January 2019,"When I first seen the critics reviews, I admit I was a little worried. Unbreakable is one of my favourite films and Split is a solid thriller with a great twist. Then you have 'Glass', which to me is a great conclusion to M Night Shyamalan's superhero trilogy. Each of the three main leads are given enough screen time for their characters to shine, and once again James Mcavoy shows us an absolutely amazing performance as Kevin, Hedwig, Dennis etc. And bringing back characters from the previous two films ( David's son, Casey) really brings a human element to this superhero psychological thriller. My only complaint would be where Unbreakable was more subtle with its comic book references, Glass throws them in your face at times ( which is odd considering that the audience should know more about comic book movies nowadays). Finally with regards to the the standard twist in his films, I don't particularly see the hate, and thought it suited the rest of the films mythology. Overall this is a solid farewell to the secret trilogy!",Glass

I would've liked more of a focus on David Dunn. But it was worth it to have the main focus on the titular character.

This secret society comes out of nowhere 10 minutes before the end of the film and gets zero zero explanation and or reasoning for existing. Ooof. Just a bad movie. Sarah Paulson was horrific.

945,DarienWest,A disgrace to the previous films,2,22 January 2019,"While I wasn't a fan of the 2 previous movies, Unbreakable and Split, they were still quite solid and I could see why a lot of people did enjoy them. But this film was a complete step backward from the previous 2 and gives us a very disappointing ending. It's really hard to write a review on this film because most of it is boring dialogue While I will admit that James Avoy's acting was nothing but good, the same can't be said for the rest of the cast. Either they tried and failed to do something with their 1 dimensional-written character or they just didn't try at all. If McAvoy's character could be written well it makes no sense to me why the others were written horribly. My friend took me to see the movie with him and his brother, and his brother told us that to him the movie felt as if ""the entire movie was stuck in the first act."" That quotes sums up the movie perfectly. You don't realize that you are reaching the end of the movie until they start throwing dumb plot twists in your face, not because you didn't expect the plot twists, but because the movie just seems to go nowhere. Even though the plot twists aren't expected, they are so ordinary that the story doesn't feel any different after you learn about them (Except for the feeling of disappointment). The soundtrack isn't bad but it is very unfitting for the tone of the movie.I was going to give this movie 1 star but James McAvoy saved this movie a SINGLE star. People who give this movie 10/10 and only have the reasoning ""McAvoy rocks!"" are impressed way too easily. Everything this movie does right is greatly overshadowed by it's failures. Hence, 2/10.",Glass

949,athul300,Perfect ending to the unlikeliest Superhero Trilogy,9,20 January 2019,"Glass is a perfect ending to the Eastrail 177 Trilogy and is in sync with the tone of both Unbreakable and Split.
The acting from the lead actors are amazing and James Mcavoy steals the show completely. Samuel Jackson portays the titular Mr.Glass to perfection. For those who are critical of Bruce Willis's performance please remember that David Dunn was a very reserved person in Unbreakable and 19 years later you can't expect his older self to be a Tony Stark.The pacing is slow but I did not feel any sequence to be boring. There are a few light comedy scenes as well unlike the previous 2 movies. Even the shyamalan cameo makes sense to connect Unbreakable and split as his previous roles in these were totally different.Most of the movie takes place in one building similar to Split .Also Footage and music from Unbreakable and Split are nicely used in Glass.Through out the movie there is a lot of focus on drawing parallels from the world of comicbooks and the existence of superheroes and villains as a pair.
The very essence of the film as a continuation from Unbreakable (and also the ending) highlights that heroes exist because of villains and vice versa and either both have to exist or none. In short the movie belongs to Elijah Price aka Mr. Glass.
The Revelation about Kevin's father and how it connects with the Unbreakable storyline was a bit unexpected. One small afterthought about its logical correctness. Joseph could so easily track the fate of Kevin's father using internet search but Kevin still had no clue about his father despite having data in public records.Apart from this everything else makes perfect sense.Dont listen to the critics and go and watch the movie if not already seen.",Glass

But man... Glass was badly written, inconsistent and utterly uninteresting. Some of it was so cringe worthy I couldn't even watch.
Where do I begin... Sarah Paulson does not belong in a superhero movie, not even in a ""different"" one. She just doesn't, period. She was DULL, forced and not even pretty in this.
James McAvoy was of course brilliant, no denying in that but his part was also poorly written and pointless 90% of the time. He was changing personalities way too fast with no purpose at all. I didn't feel or sympathize with any of them, they were just there to show us he can act that? Ok, not his fault of course.
I am usually not a SLJ fan but his performance was flawless and probably the only thing I actually enjoyed... He IS the perfect Mr. Glass but this was not the movie for him...
The kind of surreal-artsy setting/cinematography felt so out of place, fake and unnecessary to the story... The movie had NO ATMOSHPERE at all. It just felt like bits and pieces trying to fit all together...
And Bruce Willis? Was he even in that? His presence and character were completely wasted...",Glass

953,ian-1701,Worst film in 5 years,1,8 April 2019,"Truly unbelievable garbage where the idea was to fabricate a nonsense plot about (even more!!!) superheros. The original films Unbreakable and Split were clever and well thought out and so you might have thought that a plot bringing them together into a single film would be great. Nope! Boring, tedious, laughable at times but never gripping nor exciting nor intellectually stimulating.
I suspect this came into being when a less-than-bright movie executive thought that Marvel were making too much money from Superheros and he thought he'd contrive one for himself in order to get a cut of the cake. Some poor writer had to then concoct a hash of a storyline to bring in Superheros.
Save your money.",Glass

I loved Split. I amazingly watched without any prior knowledge of the link to Unbreakable and so watched it completely on it's own merit as a fantastic psychological thriller. James Mcavoy as the multiple personalities was immense. Only when old Brucie popped up at the end did I realise the connection.
Finally we get to Glass. In my opinion a perfect amalgamation of the first two films. It's creepy, it's slow moving, the characters have depth (James Mcavoy?!), the story is intriguing, and the ending is exactly what your typical superhero film isn't. I loved it so much. It was the perfect ending to the trilogy. Top marks",Glass
955,Simulcron,It reveals to you that your understanding of the world is upside-down,9,29 January 2019,"Glass represents a deconstruction of the superhero genre. It is self-conscious (reflexive) of its own content and structure.This is primarily a revenge story in which the two villains team up to avenge the weakest (most broken) among us: the disabled and neuro-divergent.What is most profound about Kevin Crumb (The Hoard) is that he represents the ""avenging angel"" who has come to punish the privileged and powerful. Despite having an inner sense of justice to make the blindly privileged feel the pain of those they have oppressed, it's easy for this to go too far to the point of morbid malevolence. But the beauty of Kevin's character is in his moral mission to protect the weak. Kevin himself was abused as a child, resulting in a ""broken"" identity, just as Mr. Glass resulted in physical brokenness. Hence, they both defend ""the broken,"" to not believe what they are told, that they are broken and disordered, but instead to believe in their potential to achieve the ""impossible.""On top of this, consider that David (Bruce Willis) represents the traditional superhero that does what? Kills criminals and defends the status quo. Little did we realize that those criminals are people that need help, that were abused by their circumstances (""oppressed"" or ""traumatized"" as some would say), and that status quo is the 10 billion crimes of capitalism that exploited all cultures and ecosystems and serves economic elites. Until we realized that generations have been indoctrinated by propaganda promulgated by establishment institutions seeking to uphold their own vested interests at the expense of social and ecological well-being, until we woke up to the fact that we had been taught an upside-down view of the world, until we understood that the criminal is just like anyone of you surviving under more difficult circumstances, only then could the ANTI-HERO's story be told. Only then could we have the dissillusionment with what is ""right"" and ""good,"" and have the empathy, the comprehension, the consciousness, the compassion to hear the anti-hero's story with understanding and without judgement. That anti-hero is here represented as Kevin (The Hoard) and Mr. Glass. In contrast, David (Bruce Willis) looks like the typical masculine figure that solves his problems through violence, killing ""criminals"" without mercy, and defending the status quo (what better represented by occupation of ""security guard"" (""guarding"" the fortress). In this context, he looks like the villian more than anyone, perhaps second to the psychiatric institutions that force ""the broken"" to adjust to a system that abuses them.This same realization of an upside-down world leads us to realize that the fallen angel, Satan, in Paradise Lost, is no more a villain than the one that sent him to the underworld.Lastly, Glass, has an interesting exploration of the concept of ""self fulfilling prophecies"" and ""faith"" in oneself.",Glass
956,starrme-932-74586,Great ending for a great trilogy.,9,17 November 2019,"The conclusion of the three films is outstanding but sadly, many people will hate it. Does NOT have tons of action, explosions or sexual content. So if your attention span is non existant, this film is not for you. It is well written with characters that you feel for. Willis' Dunn character is spot on and McAvoy nails Crumb to perfection once again. And watching Sam Jackson as Elijah is almost pure poetry; a role he was born to play. The ending was more reality based and thus probably unsatisfactory for many who expect the happy ending for the hero.

967,ajwbaseball,Shyamalan at his... most,6,19 January 2019,"Whew where to begin... (spoilers for unbreakable and split)
All things considered, this is not a bad movie. But if you are not familiar with the previous movies in this surprise trilogy, I highly recommend them- not only are they necessary viewing in order to fully appreciate Glass, both Unbreakable and Split are excellent movies on their own. If you are familiar with the previous entries, then you should be aware of the general setup, as was teased at the end of Split... David Dunn vs the Horde. And the title being a reference to the mischievous Mr. Glass clues you in to his role in the finale of this trilogy.
Enough meandering... let's get into the movie.
There's a lot to unpack here, considering Shyamalan is one of the most... unique? Storytellers out there. He doesn't always hit his mark, but he tells his stories the way he wants them told. In that respect, he did a good job with the story, and it works as a stand-alone premise and even better as a thematic conclusion to the Eastrail trilogy- to a certain point. Basically, the first 75% is a perfect blending of previous story elements, characters, themes, and tones, while working in a few new elements that work. While the typical clunky M.Night dialogue is present, it's not too bad in the context of the film as a whole.
It is also apparent that everyone brings their A-game to this movie. While it doesn't always land, you can tell everyone at least tried their best and explored new ways to act, film, etc. it is pretty damn ambitious in my opinion, and I respect that. As this and Unbreakable serve as Superhero movie de-constructions, Glass finds innovative ways to dissect the genre and it does not come across heavy handed at all (until the end). The acting is certainly varied here, as the three leads give phenomenal performances, as does the new 'antagonist'... but everyone else is pretty terrible, especially the actor playing Joseph Dunn. I don't really blame him, he hasn't really been in anything since Unbreakable, when he was still a child. The cinematography is great for the most part (until the end), as is the score.In a nutshell, this is a great sequel to both Unbreakable and Split until the last 20mins, where a switch is flipped and M.Night goes all out Shyamalan... in the worst possible way. But honestly, it's still worth it for the good parts. If you liked Split and Unbreakable, definitely check this out.",Glass
968,Taomis,Love letter to comic,4,30 January 2019,"A love letter to comic book genre
The first 20 minutes of this movie is just done so well you expect the rest of the movie to keep that same intensity , all the main puzzle have been put together and then M Night needed to fix the last puzzle and he's got a masterpiece on his hands but everything went a different way and M Might never actually seemed to get a hold of this movie , felt like the film became an entity of its own and M Night lost the wheel . Good movie at the end but the issues remain . Run time was just jarring because it didn't need to be that long and the movie kept writing in scenes that should be left in the cutting room , the characters started overplaying themselves including several characters that just didn't need to be in the movie eg the victim girl .",Glass

It is a movie that connects all the the previous movies and give satisfying ending. It is slow and boring and especially frustrating if one haven't watched previous movie as this movie is just a conclusion to previous movies.

However, the movie kept me interested in what would come next. That's what a movie supposed to do! The critics are pompous, self-minded people. They believe, what they say matters. What irritates me the most, it's the way they ""destroy"" a movie, when they have any idea, how difficult must be to make a movie. Go watch the movie, find out for yourself.

977,loudog-69437,A Grand Finale,8,25 February 2019,"I will admit, I was incredibly nervous when I saw the first reviews for this movie. It hurt just a little bit more than most because I have been looking forward to this movie since I saw split. But I bought the tickets and went to go see it, bracing myself for whatever was to come.I am soooooo glad that I went.This movie was absolutely amazing. While it does have its flaws and doesn't live up to the masterpiece that is unbreakable, I put it on par with split. After seeing it, I was confused as to why people didn't like it. It does almost the exact same thing that unbreakable did. Smart plays on the tropes of comic books that are executed in brilliant ways.We have to remember that when unbreakable came out, it was not criticaly praised either. Back then, super hero movies were not as abundant as they are now. And then all of the sudden this quiet superhero movie comes out of nowhere and plays with all these tropes that only hardcore comic fans are familiar with. This is why I'm shocked that in the era we live in now, when superheroes have become mainstream, people still don't get it.In a nutshell, that is really what the problem with everyone who didn't like this movie: they didn't get it. Admittedly, you have to fit a very certain criteria to like this film. You have to either be a die hard fan of unbreakable, a die hard fan of split, have a deep love of comics and a deep understanding of how they work, or all of the above. But like I said, if you don't fit that criteria, you wont get it.So give this movie a chance. If you didn't like it, please go see it again with what I said in mind, and maybe you'll change your mind. If you don't, you're entitled to your opinion and I can't change that. But I will stand by my claim that glass is the perfect finale to an epic trilogy.",Glass

979,elijahpitts-09626,A ending not worth talking about,5,27 January 2019,"Unbreakable and Split are such good movies that Glass is easily a letdown. The movie has amazing acting from legends of the industry like James McAvoy and Samuel Jackson. Bruce Willis being a huge let down in this movie.t The interaction between the three main characters is incredibly forgettable and lackluster. Great pacing from the movie as well, but boring storytelling. feeling like a very dark and grounded superhero movie feeling a lot like Christopher Nolan's dark knight trilogy. The biggest problem with Glass is its dullness, the ending, and the two great movies the it came from. . The combat feels very boring and reminds me a lot of early 2000s superhero flicks like fantastic 4 and Elektra. The ending feel like it was randomly thrown together to give us one last shock. The final shock being very confusing and leaves you with a feeling of wanting more. M Night is not a director you give a trilogy final too, even when he creates the first two amazing parts.",Glass
980,dmd-04860,So many excellent things to say about this movie,8,16 January 2019,"This director is one of my favorites: I enjoy his attention to detail, not just in camera shots/angles/movement, but in every aspect of story-telling. I enjoy how he doesn't rush scenes and allows facial expression to speak volumes when the characters are not speaking at all. I appreciate his patience in allowing the story to unfold (and not giving into the temptation to rush things). I enjoy his unconventional way of telling stories, and it's particularly fun when a director is able to stay one-step ahead of the audience - a wonderful gift. You'll find all of these aspects, and many more, in Glass. Also, a fantastic cast.
I very much enjoyed Unbreakable. I didn't know Split was connected until recent, so I had to rent it -- though made me uneasy, it was well done. Glass was very entertaining in how all the pieces come together. Looking forward to more from this director.",Glass

You will not understand the plot or the characters and their significance.A lot of people watched split thinking it would be it's own separate entity- just a good ol thriller. I thought that too.... until I saw the ending.Glass is the perfect ending to the Unbreakable universe. I was THRILLED to see that Shyamalan was continuing one of my all time favorite films with my favorite characters.Unbreakable is one of the most underrated movies of its time. And Glass is the perfect ending to the story of my beloved comic book characters from way back in the day. I cried like a baby at the end of this movie. I didn't want it to be over.Glass did not disappoint. It was engaging, it kept me on edge, and it had twists and turns which are signature to the director that got me just like they always do.It felt so good to see Mr. Glass again. Also, James McAvoy's acting is genuinely amazing. He deserves awards for this... but critics like to shut down M.

As it becomes clear MR glass' plan comes to fruition the reaction of the randomly placed pedestrians as they look at there phones to see this remarkable footage thats going around the internet like a virus is the stuff of cringeworthy cinema legacy. It left me feeling sick inside seeing such poor overacting. And the three protagnists links, mr glass mother, unbreakables son, and 9 year old mr splits girlfriend. All sat on a bench holding hands with weird smiles on there faces really pained me.I didnt like how the movie was stuck in one location its appeared cheap. And lazy. The acting from all actors was not great. James Mcavoy is capeable of better. Yes its great he can act feminine then angry and masculine. Then like a child it's great, however isn't enjoyable to watch. The famle psychologist had to much screentime and offered the viewer nothing. I didnt appreciate all the close face shots of her when she was talking. Her realtionship with the 9 year olds girlfriend was weird aswell. The final fight was poor it was just an old Bruce Willis pushing James Mcavoy against a bus. With some cut scenes of people looking serious or saying some silly things.

993,chruebert,James McAvoy rescues the title which suffers from Actor-Narration-Syndrome,6,19 March 2019,"You can tell very quickly if a movie is being on the brink of a disaster by the times the narration of Actors on Screen is talking you out of immersion. I call it Actor-Narration-Syndrome, which means the actor is telling you what you are supposed to see with your own eyes, just in case you missed it. Sometimes it's made subtile and here it is quite obvious and in my oppinion this type of narration is dragging down any movie ever made, by actually telling the audiance it is dumb.As we know the whole Unbreakable story is a real world Superhero-Comic and i find this idea really good in general. Also M. Night Shyamalan is the master of story telling as long as he let's us watch the things happening. That means the first half of this movie is good for this part and then we have our on Screen narrators Mr Glass, his mother, Casey and Joseph Dunn. Sure Dr Staple is just another narrator but she and her staff fit the picture as they have completely perfect fitting dialogues.I will not reveal here any story plot, but looking at the characters you will find James McAvoys acting really good and he is really favoured by the plot. Also Bruce Willis/David Dunn did get a fair share but i believe he was written way too passive, more accepting already that he was taking into an asylum without his consent. I found Joseph on the other hand good at the start but then a bit meh. The build up of mr Glass was really good but totally crashed towards the end with too much narration (scenes in the trailer), while i think the story was actually good enough to reach a rating of 8.
At the end a bit of a narration from off-screen could have helped better to get the picture right for the audiance as well as keeping out a needless cameo.I always wondered how does David Dunn shower if it makes him collapse. :D",Glass

998,FredOnFilm,'Flashes of brilliance are not enough to save the film from falling apart in an underwhelming final act.',6,20 January 2019,"Glass is the newest film written and directed by M. Night Shyamalan and brings a conclusion to the surprise trilogy set up with Unbreakable and Split. 19 years after the first instalment, we are re-introduced to David Dunn (Bruce Willis), now operating under the vigilante guise of 'The Overseer'. David sets out to track down Split's Kevin Wendell Crumb (James McAvoy), the psychotic custodian of 24 split personalities. The two individuals ultimately find themselves confined to a psychiatric hospital where they join criminal mastermind Mr Glass (Samuel L. Jackson). Dr Ellie Staple (Sarah Paulson) is the psychiatrist assigned to treat and convince the three men that their perceived super-human abilities are mere delusions. While Glass is certainly entertaining and even brilliant in some sequences, I can't help but feel a little underwhelmed by the direction Shyamalan ultimately decided to take.As a massive fan of Shyamalan's pseudo-superhero universe, I have to say it brought a gigantic smile to my face watching Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson and James McAvoy all on screen together. McAvoy and Jackson give outstanding performances, with McAvoy the clear stand-out throughout. The film opens with some thrilling sequences that immediately bring the viewer up to speed with events that have occurred off-screen. While the initial setup prepares you for action, the film really finds its feet in the more dramatic and slower-burning middle section set in the psychiatric hospital. Here we are reminded that this is by no means your traditional super-hero story, with characters who are multi-layered and plagued with flaws. These sequences, and in particular the interplay between Crumb and Mr. Glass, are ultimately where this film succeeds. McAvoy once again delivers a powerhouse performance that is surely Oscar-worthy. Unfortunately, these flashes of brilliance are not enough to save the film from falling apart in an underwhelming final act. As with other Shyamalan movies, this is another ambitious production that walks the fine line between genius and idiocy.While the performances and dialogue featured in the hospital scenes are certainly entertaining, they lack the thematic intelligence found in the series' previous entries. Despite being called Glass, this is really more of a Split sequel, with Willis and Jackson missing in large parts of the narrative. Other characters are also under-used, in particular, Anya Taylor-Joy's Casey Cooke, who was a fantastic addition to the Split cast. The final act of this film is certainly going to be divisive and the overall critical response so far has been nothing short of savage. As much as I enjoyed this film, I find it near impossible to defend the direction Shyamalan ultimately decided to take this franchise. If this film had been in the hands of a filmmaker less talented, then I probably wouldn't have ended up this disappointed. Shyamalan is a creative genius who once again shows for the large majority of this film how gifted he really is. His use of colour in scenes is creative and incredibly effective in setting a tone for the narrative. Overall, I am still torn on how I really feel about this film. On one hand, I love a good two-thirds of the movie but on the other, I still feel frustrated and let down.If you are a fan of both Unbreakable and Split then I have to recommend you go see Glass. It is most certainly worth a watch, despite its obvious flaws and disastrous conclusion. James McAvoy's performance is worth the price of admission alone and once again contributes to some of the more memorable movie scenes of recent times. Glass is far from a satisfying conclusion to Shyamalan's pseudo-superhero trilogy, but nevertheless remains an intriguing character study that is sure to win over many people.FredOnFilm Movie Rating: C+Visit the FredOnFilm movie blog for all the latest news, reviews and discussion in the world of cinema .",Glass

He is the best at making good actors and actresses poor imitations of their usually brilliant selves.Most of Shys films, for me, are almost unwatchable and I'm amazed Hollywood continues to bankroll his cinematic custard pies .So, it comes as no biggie that this film is as bad as the rest. Shyamalan is a master at making a film where not much happens and then providing the audience with a fantastically dull twist at the end (which apparently, alot of people seem to love.)That said, Its weird that I do love watching the crap he churns out just so my girlfriend and I can have a good laugh at the end.",Glass

I'm not sure I'll watch the rest if I turn it off now, which would probably lower my star rating to a 2, so I'm committing myself to finishing it. I know it's a movie, fiction of horror or thriller or supernatural (?) whatever but I really take offense when writers take umbrage with facts & reality & try to sell us paying customers a bill of goods that is as bologna as swiss cheese. Yes I know I am supposed to believe someone can walk on the ceiling so why should I be bothered when a few random individuals circumvent the law, take citizens into medical custody & do ""experiments"" on them without due process? Or have an actual serial murderer in this hospital with a small setup of lights to keep him under control, as obviously people are going in & out of the ""secure"" rooms without much effort, even while supposedly on camera? Or this same murderer & another walk thru the hospital without detection, make noises that SHOULD wake the dead, kill someone without any warnings signaled, take over the com & open doors without alarms. JHC. What stupidity. Sure yeah anything can be accomplished in a movie without boundaries & some semblance of rationality & reality. I can watch Chowder too & be entertained just as surely.And yes, the inane dialogue was just that, pretentious, pointless & a pandering mess. Ok so I'll allow that James McAvoy pulled off being a dozen or so over the top characters for a few seconds to a few minutes a piece, I don't think that's quite a magnificent feat so much as how much he can change his voice, tenor and inflect accents while bulging his very impressive muscles, but so can a lot of actors and comedians.

While bringing back existing characters from the previous films for some serious heart warming moments. I would definitely stay away from the trailers !

The blending of the characters of 2 separate movies was done quite well, but not without hiccups. I applaud James McAvoy's performance, like he did in Split. I really enjoyed Bruce Willis's acting as well, the man has been around for so long, he is just pleasant to watch as an actor. I do think The Overseer deserved better in this movie.

BUT, they had supernatural power. ""This is not a cartoon, there will be limits"" this is what the movie was, there was limits, but still they were almost supernatural. This is what superheroes would be like if they existed in the real world, not the avengers and superman overpowering, overwhelming and cliche powers. They'd still be very much human. The Evil organization wasn't my taste but I guess it's a good way to explain what has been going on and why these people don't show up in the light. Some parts of the dialogue are deep and thought-provoking. I expected entertaining, cliche action. I got something better, a good story. I should've known I wasn't watching a marvel's movies.

1023,angelsim,Anticlimactic Finish To An Overall Good Series,2,6 November 2019,"First of all I want to start by admitting that I didn't watch the whole movie - it was that un-entertaining. I only managed to get through and hour and a half of it.Every character, other than the three main ones, seems underdeveloped. Felt like Shyamalan wanted to give more attention to Bruce Willis' son, Samuel Jackson's mother and the victim of James McAvoy from 'Split' but it seemed like he gave up on that idea ~20 minutes into the movie and just left them as they are. I cannot help but feel that they could have added more depth to the story if they were given more, but the result was underwhelming - they did not do anything interesting or add to the story.
The connection of Anya Taylor-Joy to the story seemed unrealistic - why all of a sudden is she feeling for the guy who killed two of her classmates?! Let alone going out of her way to try and help him by telling him how to behave so that he can get out of there?!
Not to mention that the performance from everyone, other than the main cast, did not bring anything to the table - it was forgettable, unintriguing and plain.It saddens me to see such an end to a story that could have been tied up in a lot more interesting way. I guess Shyamalan went with what was popular at the time - grand comic book stories - instead of somehow making the movie more dark and going into the depths of human psychology and intellect - the exact thing that won 'Split' it's fame.To end on a high note - I would love to see another attempt by Shyamalan, Willis and McAvoy to work together and create something extraordinary, as I am sure that they are capable of doing!",Glass

Samuel L. Jackson was somewhere between.The beginning was pretty good. I was hooked by the building tension. There is some interesting camerawork. I think this is where Shayamalan shines. The slow burning tension that continues to build really draws you in and keeps you engaged. This is where it goes off the rails for me.I'd say Shayamalan's twists are 50/50. When they work, they're great. When they miss, they pretty much derail the entire movie. This movie was a big miss for me.My wife hadn't seen Unbreakable or Split.

1032,nmik2005,An unfair end to Unbreakable.,6,25 January 2019,"I feel like one of biggest problem that works against this movie is the expectations you'd have based on the teases from Unbreakable and Split. What I expected to see was a big clash between David Dunn and the Monster where Elijah would be the puppeteer that leads the others to fight (kind of like lex luthor from BvS, or what Zemo does in Civil war)We still have that fight, but the clash was way better in my head than in the big screen. I think that is still okay, not every movie needs to be Marvel or DC in it's scale. But what came after that with the existence of a secret organization that had been killing off super heroes was just outlandish. It is definitely a twist like what you'd see in M.Night's earlier movies but it could have been done in a better way. I wanted to see more of Dunn's character but this was a more of a sequel to Split with characters of Unbreakable making glorified cameos in the sense that the movie just focused on Kevin, even though the movie was titled Glass after Elijah's character. By the end we do see the redemption arc for Elijah which did justify naming the title of the movie as Glass, but I don't think it was well deserved.This is a really interesting movie in which I had issues. I wasn't bored at all and I was hooked throughout. This is the Anti Marvel movie that the world deserved but it just failed in it's execution. Kudos for the effort but I've been waiting for a sequel to Unbreakable for years and wasn't the sequel it deserved. The movie tries to end off with a hopeful message for the hidden ""superhero"" community but it's actually based on an assumption made by the director that if you post a video then it'll go viral no matter what. If I had seen a video with superheroes in it, my first instinct would be that it's acted out or just a complete fake.",Glass

Night Shyamalan got a special talent when it comes to setting a certain mood in movies and he did not disappoint this time either, the visuals and sound were spot on and very well executed. As usual he tries to do that ""twist"" in his movies to give the audience that ""A-ha"" moment but that fell flat like the movie unfortunately. It actually left me half angry because of how stupid it actually was but hey, to each his own.I personally left the cinema disappointed and only gave it a 5 because of it's really high quality in visuals and James McAvoy's acting.

The further the movie progressed the worse it got.Before I get super critical I think this movies visuals are much more interesting and experimental that most, and very often scenes where staged and lit in really satisfying ways. The performances where all great even if the material wasn't, and of course, McAvoy was incredible.But on to the bad stuff.The whole premise of imprisoning the characters for 75% of the movie was pretty ill-advised, particularly because they never spent this time developing character or adding interesting elements, in fact looking back I can't see any characters arcs in the whole film. If I was to boil it down to the most broad issues I'd say it's that the movie looses focus of the characters, and fails at evenly balancing the three protagonist so as a result they all feel undeveloped. Hence the movie is pretty unsatisfying.The ending was really where things fell apart. I won't spoil anything but the way that it was setup didn't feel cathartic or anywhere near as emotional as it was meant to, and new elements where added that really required more background and explanation, but they didn't give any at all.Overall, if I look at this movie as a sequel to Unbreakable, it's not a satisfying conclusion. As a standalone movie, it doesn't work because it relies on the emotional weight of the other movies carrying through. As a sequel to Spit I think it works best because it has a similar pace and setting. In the span of Shymalans career it lies somewhere in the middle, no where near as bad as The Happening or After Earth but it's very disappointing compared to the rest of this trilogy.",Glass

Firstly its a character piece and not an action movie so lets get that out of the way. So people who say its slow - Did you ever see Unbreakable?Its an intelligent dark take on comic books and heroes and villains. Best thing about this movie is the fleshed out characters. Not only the main cast but the extras, the orderlies side cast all give a good performance. Of course Mac Voy shines the brightest. His Horde performance is like Toni Collette in Heriditary. Worth an oscar but will never get one. But just for watching his performance is worth the price of admission. Sam Jackson is also awesome in the second half.Mr.Shyamalan proves why he is such a great director. His camerawork , use of score and color creates a beautiful visual masterpiece. He is probably one of the few directors out there trying to do something different instead of grabbing onto a formula and churning the same thing again and again.So Yeah why are all those You tube and media critics crying? Indeed its a risky movie and would be polarizing for a lot of people who went in expecting something else. However, the movie does deliver as a sequel to Split and Unbreakable and honors both. It is an intelligent piece of filmmaking.So my final thoughts would be to advise all to go and watch it and form your own opinion not be biased by reviews.I want this movie to do a Venom.

It started off great, Willis is still in his game and does what he does best. Same for the introducing of McAvoy, no surprises there. Then we meet the character of Sarah Paulson, who I just wanted to see dead after five minutes of watching her. From that point the movie kind of numbs off for about an hour, with some highlights from McAvoys performance.
Towards the end I got that crescendo feeling, a clash of the Titans between Willis and McAvoy, some twists off course. But for me the movie fell flat and the ending gave me an antiklimax feeling.Some spoiling ahead.I really dont know how Shyamalan was thinking with this one... Perhaps he plans more sequels in the same universe, but with other actors, or for other directors to follow up.
But the ending in this movie, I dont quite get it. Yes, a throwdown, some twists from Jacksons character and other revelations that there may or may not be other ""superheroes"" and ""supervillains"" out there. But to me, the ending was more of a, ""the bad guy wins"" moment.",Glass

The ending ruined the movie for me. I loved Split, enjoyed Unbreakable, and was really looking forward to this movie. I saw the bad reviews, but I went to go see it because of the previous two movies.Not counting plot holes, one of my biggest problems with Glass is how they so poorly handled the characters. While the psych institution was interesting, I didn't buy it. Not only did I not buy it, I was forced to endure it for practically the full duration of the movie.Dunn's entire character arc in Unbreakable was learning, and accepting his potential and abilities. Learning to believe. He then spends 19 years having visions of the bad deeds of others, bending steel, overpowering grown adults like children, presumably withstanding things that should leave him otherwise injured, etc; But no, Shaymalan thinks he can hit the reset button on Dunn and now he suddenly doesn't believe in himself again. The notion of ""Maybe I'm just a regular man"" should be ludicrous at this point. Same for The Beast quite frankly. If that's not enough, after hitting the reset button on Dunn's character the entire movie, they just throw him away by drowning him in a puddle. Who drowns him? Some random bad-guy they introduced just a few seconds prior. What a twist! It's clever because you didn't see it coming! Load of crap. There's no character growth, purpose, or much of anything. Dunn is just a tool to make a YouTube video of super-humans in the last 5 minutes of the movie.Same for The Beast. It was amazing watching all the personalities, but after hiding away for 20 something years, after what amounts to probably less than 5 minutes of exposure to the real world in this movie, Kevin is suddenly willing to, and has the ability to keep the Light to himself. He has a last minute shoehorned full circle character arc. Better than Dunn, but again, poor handling and wasted potential. Both characters are contained and only get to interact with a bland, boring lady who pushes an unconvincing narrative.There was no real payoff. The entire payoff to this movie was the fact that they defeated the secret society (IMMEDIATELY AFTER IT WAS EVEN INTRODUCED) by revealing a few YouTube clips of superhuman feats. Maybe I'd care more if there was a higher focus on the video and the effects on the populace, but no, the movie ends right there with no further expansion. It's out, roll credits. You can kill everyone off sure, but make their purpose and departure seem a little bit more meaningful.This is the most disappointed I have ever been in a movie if I'm honest.",Glass
1055,jer283,"Great idea, strange direction",7,15 February 2019,"Glass is the follow up to Split (2016) and Unbreakable (2000), two very interesting films in their own right. M Night Shyamalan does a good job of integrating those two films into their sequel. That being said, I am rather disappointed. I don't want to give the plot away, or reveal the inevitable twists, but I will say I expected more.What I expected specifically I'm not sure of. I'm an avid fan of movies based on comic books. While this isn't exactly the same, with only the characters comparing themselves to comic book characters rather than the film being based on a book, I guess I wanted to see more hero-villain interaction. I know Shyamalan movies are much more toned down than typical superhero flicks, but after watching Unbreakable in 2000, I always hoped we'd get to see David Dunn again, exacting vigilante justice on those outside the law or moral code. But Glass took that idea, and threw it in a prison, almost literally. David Dunn's role is toned down much more than I'd hoped, and even Mr. Glass and Kevin Crumb's roles are without their potential.However, criticism aside, the movie has standout acting, and superb cinematography. The plot twist is good, and unexpected. But I have a feeling that many will not appreciate the ending - myself included. But then again, I'm accustomed to superhero-based movies full of CGI, and continuous action. Shyamalan typically bases his movies on everyday reality, but throws in some curve balls to make that reality turn upside down. As I mentioned before, it is much more toned down than you'll expect if you're looking for the next superhero action flick. But once you delve into the idea Shyamalan expresses, I expect you'll enjoy it for what it is.",Glass

If SS is a true, original, groundbreaking masterpiece, Glass is just another of M. Night Shyamalan's egocentric craziness. It's a joke, but you won't laugh. I'd say Sixth Sense is the only reason the movie business still banks on this guy's trips.Ok he's got Praying In Anger. The Village had a real and original story, plot and lots of suspense... Unbreakable and yes Split are watchable too, and I'll give that Signs is kinda entertaining. And that's it. He's too inconsistent and Glass is a low, low point. Another one. That ""theme and symbolism"" ideas of his is just a way to try and look deep and philosophical. There's none of that, just pedantic attitude and a collage of awkward situations.As someone else said here it's weird. But not in a positive or entertaining or provocative way. It's just weird, awkward. That embarrassing feel I got in The Lady in the Water when it is ""revealed"" that the key to the enigma of the story is in the cereal box...

I'm 48 and only twice in my life or so I left the room before THE END hits the screen.Glass just kept me seated until the credits in disbelief. I felt ashamed for the entire second half of the film. I had to see how big of a mess it is in its entirety, and be sure he wouldn't pull a miracle in the last 5 minutes and save this pedantic disgrace. Of course he didn't in fact he managed to sink it even further. I couldn't even laugh of it or my situation.It's pompous and exaggerated and all over the place. It has to explain and justify everything every 5 minutes of its long, torturing 2 hours +. The pace is crazy, unstructured, the dialogs and interactions just... arrrgh!

Their presence and charisma makes the film slightly more bearable despite the horrible directing and crazy storyline. And that's it. Just avoid.",Glass
1060,alinda-thelostgirl,Never underestimate a mastermind,8,3 February 2019,"First of all, I am not a hardcore M.Night Shyamalan fan. Sure, I loved The Sixth Sense (1999) and Unbreakable (2000), was baffled by later movies and bored to death by even later ones and honestly had started questioning his ability as a storyteller (cinematography and photography were always impeccable, but pleasing my eyes can distract my brain from being annoyed at the lack of content in a film only so many times).It wasn't until The Visit (2015) that my interest was sparked once more. While still flawed, it delivered all the emotions a film like that should deliver, and I was genuinely thrilled by everything, including the inevitable Shyamalan twist.So when I saw Split (2016), it was still with mixed anticipation and suspicion: either our boy has got his spark back or The Visit has been a fluke. But naturally, I was blown away, if not by a plot that, while enthralling, didn't really bring anything new to the genre, by McAvoy's brilliant performance and by that one last scene connecting the film to one of my all time favourites.Now, some might not remember this, because Samuel L. Jackson has become a living legend and Unbreakable has become pretty iconic, but at the time of its release people's reaction to its ending were pretty mixed: either they loved it or they hated it, and while this can be said about many films, I rarely saw such a conscious divisiveness. More often than not people who love or hate a film have different reasons supporting their feelings, while in the case of Unbreakable, it was this one element that just split public opinion in two. Unbreakable was the Marmite of films.For this reason, when I saw how the critics had panned Glass (2019) while some blogging movie goers were ecstatic, I knew I couldn't let either point of view affect me. Unfortunately, it did, as it warped my expectations in a different way. I expected the film to leave me either raving or raging, so perhaps my problem by the end of it was that I didn't feel either way.The first act does a solid job of picking up where we left them. We see that the Horde is still up to its antics, kidnapping girls whose perfect, easy lives have made them impure and unworthy. We then find out that the past nineteen years David Dunn has been embracing the role he was given: a hero, helping those in need and intervening where the forces of order cannot seem to get anywhere.If this part of the film has any flaws, it is in what I call ""lack of trust"" on the filmmakers part: they don't trust the moviegoers to be either smart enough or attentive enough to figure out or understand things on their own and therefore spell everything out for them, often by using the secondary characters like David's son, to exposition everything. A little more faith in the audience would have made certain awkward dialogues go a tad more smoothly.The second act takes place in the mental institution we were shown repeatedly in the trailer. We knew the three protagonists would be assembled here, and were looking forward to it. This part is both brilliant and boring: the brilliance is in the way it questions all the beliefs built in the previous two films and in the first act of this very one, leading both the characters and us watching to wonder if we weren't just being delusional. Add to this some brilliant acting, especially from James McAvoy (how many personalities did he end up displaying here? I believe almost all of the famously advertised ones in the Split promotional campaign, and in sequence within the same take, too! Outstanding) and the whole thing could have been flawless. Except it wasn't. Once again we aren't trusted with being capable to understand things without someone reiterating them to us, burdening once more the dialogues with over-exposition and, well, boring us a little.I honestly would've done with a bit less exposition and a bit more of David and Elijah, whose psychoanalysis deserved equal interest. But what appears to have been the choice here is that the audience already got to explore enough of their mindsets in Unbreakable and there wasn't much development to add to them here. Which is disappointing and hardly believable, and this is a major flaw in the script. The editing of Dr. Staple's analysis was beautifully realised in terms of camerawork and performance, but the lines were superficial and lacking, which was a real pity.Then we get to the final act, and here is where my enthusiasm cools off. The showdown looks really good, even in terms of fight choreography, and the artistic choices behind some of the camera work remind us that this is an M.Night Shyamalan film without being overly pretentious.However, rather than having a twist, it has a number of twists. And while I never look forward to a twist in a film, if there has to be one, it needs to have an impact on me. Unbreakable and Split had both delivered on that front, so it is somewhat disappointing that Glass with not one but what I think were three twists... does nothing.Rather than surprised, I was bemused that none of them had any real effect on how I would perceive the events happened until them. If anything, they reminded me of those parodies of soap operas where every line was the reveal of a twist, or even of the waterfall scene in Sherlock Holmes: A game of Shadows (2011) in the parody video of How It Should Have Ended.That said, the ending was weak, not bad. It didn't so much bore or upset me but rather disappoint me, like a Doctor Who finale while Stephen Moffat was the show runner: had the set up and buildup not been so good, with such excellent performances that could excite and thrill so much, hooking me to the story, I probably wouldn't have found the epilogue so underwhelming.All in all, this is a very good film, it's just a pity that it's the last chapter to two far superior films. I will probably watch it again, and perhaps have a marathon watching all three films back to back, and give Glass another few shots at winning me over. It's definitely the best sequel to one of his iconic franchises Bruce Willis has been in for quite some time, and it's also one of his best performances in the last years, and just for that, M.Night Shyamalan deserves some mad props. It has solid performances from all of its cast really, except James McAvoy's which would be better described as ""mind blowing"". And it recaptures the atmosphere and feel of the previous instalments quite well, preserving the superhero meets reality quality Unbreakable had established.",Glass

Very unfortunate given the importance of David Dunn to this series & the class that Brucey boy can bring to the screen.
Also, a special nod to Sarah Poulson, as in everything she's ever taken on, handing out a very good showing once again.Many of the loony bin scenes throughout (Especially those involving Glass himself) could have either been left on the cutting room floor, or taken down by a good few minutes. Too many times scenes are dragged out as a tension build without actually much of a pay off (if at all)But still, McAvoy is once again superb and that is some shape he's built himself into!

Yes I still stand by what I originally said about the trilogy was like a book but there are plenty of other stories Shyamalan can go from here. He could always take the route that none of the three actually died at the end of Glass and are actually knocked out and transported to different mental facilities the world of Unbreakable still has enough room left to either end the story here at the end of Glass or go on with three other unique individuals with extraordinary powers. And while I think just on the topic of Kevin and his 24 personalities in his origin film (Split) I think my favorite personality was Hedwig but in Glass my favorite personality is easily Dennis in Glass Dennis is no longer the one of the three dangerous psychopathic personalities but now he's a broken man type of personality he sees his mistakes in trusting Patricia and now he is just so distraught that he is trying to right his wrongs from Split.",Glass

Amazing acting though once again.The plot wasn't interesting at all. Mr. Glass wants to convince the world that superheroes exist. A secret organization tries to stop him. A couple of boring fight scenes and a few passionate conversations about comic books later (nothing against comics but please) Mr. Glass manages to show the world that superhuman abilities actually exist. Big deal.At one point the doctor at the psychiatric clinic tried to explain the supernatural abilities with logic: Dunn is basically just a very smart person that in a Sherlock Holmes kind of way, can subconsciously pick up every little detail about you and create a theory in his head about who you are and what you did in the past. I would have liked it if that was actually true and the movie continued by exploring the characters in that manner.",Glass
1089,ethanbeard,"Some great moments, some terrible moments",5,24 January 2019,"I want to preface this review by stating that I really enjoy both Unbreakable and Split, though I have only seen each film once. I am not a die-hard fan of these films to the point of ignoring glaring faults, but I am however invested in this world and these characters and was looking forward to this new film. I believe I went in with a good mindset: expecting some mindless fun and interesting interactions between these well-written characters, but not expecting anything too deep or creative. For the most part, that's what I got (with a few exceptions).Let's begin with the pros. The first thing I thought when the film ended was how much I enjoyed the score. The ticking clock featured in most of the tracks was very suspenseful and made every scene much more enjoyable. The cinematography (for the most part) was pretty good. I enjoyed the composition of many shots and there are quite a few close-ups on characters that really worked for me. There are, surprisingly, some very creative things that director M. Night Shyamalan did with the camera in this film. Upside down shots, long takes, dutch angles, etc. These things have been in other films, of course, but as someone who expected this film to be shot very blandly, it was a welcome surprise. It was very fun to watch Mr. Glass and David Dunn back on the big screen again, and especially exciting to see them interacting with Kevin and his many personalities. Despite the very different tones of Unbreakable and Split, this film manages to bring those worlds together in a way that feels natural. And, of course, the best part of the movie was James McAvoy's performance. He is one of the best actors working today and this film proves it. He switches personalities so seamlessly it honestly feels like a completely different person every time. He stole the scene every time he showed up on screen and the film is worth seeing just for him.Unfortunately, the film is not perfect. I have many problems with it. For starters, David Dunn is somewhat irrelevant in this film. He does not go through a character arc and, in fact, disappears for what feels like 20 minutes in the middle of the film. Bruce Willis does what he can with what he's given, but David has nothing to do in this film, which is massively disappointing for fans of Unbreakable. Thee writing is not too great either. The story feels both empty and crowded. The first half of the movie feels like you're caught in a time loop as the same conversations and situations are repeated over and over in the mental facility, then as the second half of the movie rolls around, Shyamalan throws everything at the audience hoping something sticks, making the climactic ending feel too messy. The dialogue, while serviceable for the most part, had some rocky moments as well. For example, the new character, Dr. Ellie Staple, is given lines that feel way too over the top for a character meant to be taken as seriously as her. She also says the same speech about superheroes at least 4 times throughout the course of the film. As well, characters from Unbreakable and Split, such as Joseph Dunn, Elijah's mother, and Casey Cooke, are thrown into this film yet serve no purpose. Elijah's mother and Casey had some fine moments but felt very thrown in, but David's son Joseph was distracting by how bad his acting was at some points. I don't think I have ever said this, but he was better as a child actor. Finally, the direction Shyamalan took with the ending was surprising (and not in a particularly good way). Without spoiling it, there is a reveal at the very end that has absolutely no set up throughout the film and feels very lazy. It is also the weakest ""twist"" of the trilogy, as it affects almost nothing except providing us with a new perspective on the events of the film, though by that time I was read for it to just end.So, while GLASS has some really excellent moments and a lot of good things going for it, it also has many problems and plot-holes too big to ignore. It is equally parts good and equally parts bad. A 5/10 score is very fitting for this film. My opinion is very ""split.'",Glass

The acting in this movie is fantastic. In fact it's the cast's ability that keeps Glass a slow burn and not a snoozefest.Once the movie gains speed, it allows the actors to stand out and deliver. McAvoy is again exemplary switching characters and is able to make you care about what is happening and the inner struggle he faces. Great efforts are turned in by the rest of the cast which serves to keep the movie going.The second act begins building towards everything that fans had been wanting to see, including a very well placed reveal about the past that sets in motion the climax and final act of the movie.However this is where at least for me (and most) the rails seem to come. In true Shyamalan form he just can't help himself but throw in a final twist that seems forced and completely leaves an unsatisfied taste in the mouth of those watching. The ending made me angry with so many options and such a brilliant cast the movie deserved a better ending than a twist secret organization exists to keep it all quiet angle.

1094,beardsmore,"Despite being the weakest in the trilogy, 'Glass' mostly sticks to the roots which made this trilogy so successful.",6,22 January 2019,"The main response, at least critically, to M. Night Shyamalan's 'Glass', seems to be that it is, above anything else, disappointing. Until 2017's 'Split' nobody ever thought the story of 'Unbreakable' would have another chapter, 'Glass' then was a film nobody really asked for, and that's not necessarily a bad thing, it doesn't mean we don't want it. In blending both aspects and genres of the two previous films, there are some solid moments. An unsurprisingly standout performance from James McAvoy, who this time gets to play 21 (I think) of Kevin's 24 personalities, is always welcome, his acting is so believable that at times it is genuinely scary. The interactions between McAvoy and Jackson are highly entertaining, especially seeing the comedic Hedwig persona interact with the straight-faced Elijah. Unfortunately the same can not be said for Willis, who despite being the protagonist of 'Unbreakable', here just feels like he has nothing to do when he's not fighting anybody. The first half of the movie (thanks to Sarah Paulson's Dr. Ellie Staple) spends a lot of time continuing with the 'deconstruction of superheroes' theme first established in 'Unbreakable'. It is at times a lot to get your head around, a nice change in pace from the other superhero films of today, many of which seem to follow a standard formula. It is somewhat ironic then that Shyamalan should ditch these psychological ties for a more action heavy final act, one that would not seem out of place in your run-of-the-mill superhero film. This for me was disappointing, but it is not a deal breaker, and the ending contains a few of Shyamalan's signature twists, wrapping the trilogy up nicely, even if it does seem a tad rushed. 'Glass' at the very least is worth seeing just to find out the fates of these characters, for many it will be disappointing, perhaps not a testimony to how bad this film is, but just how good the other two were. But 'Glass' certainly has its moments, even if it is the weakest of the three.",Glass

Many of my gripes with this film could have been corrected by almost any other director who knows how to work actors. I loved Unbreakable, and Split was refreshing and exciting. I do not have any beef with Shyamalan and went into the film thinking the critics must have been too harsh. There were very and I mean very small glimmers of what could have been an epic, but it all fell by the wayside...There was so much wasted potential from Bruce Willis and Samuel L. Jackson. The scenes that Bruce WIllis were in were far and few between, and when he did show up it was extremely underwhelming and disappointing. There were some confusing timeline shifts that did not feel right, scenes that popped out of nowhere with poor timing, and unnecessary actors and prolonged shots.The surprise ending was feeble and the actors were so dramatic that it made me wince.

The entire cast is very good, although James McAvoy's ""Kevin Crumb and the Horde"" steals just about every single scene and he plays his role (or roles) extremely well and convincingly. Upcoming star Anya Taylor-Joy was also a nice standout in this despite having a small part. In addition, the main plot of the film takes some time to get too, but the story does a solid job of tying together all the characters and story arcs from the previous two films, ""UNBREAKABLE"" (2000) and 'SPLIT"" (2016) and making sense of it all, in a complex, twisted, not what you will expect, manner. To add, the story in this film is very complex, so if you are looking for a Simple, Straight forward, Elaborate, Fantasy, Eye Candy, Spectacle packed, Superhero movie, like any of the MCU or DCEU movies, you may not like this one. It is a very ""Grounded"" Superhero film.As for the movie's execution, the film is told from Subjective Camera Angles, Reverse Shots, and Parallel editing. The film involves the audience heavily, creating discomfort, showing superiority, and dominance from all the main and supporting characters. Personally it gave me vibes a little bit of Jonathan Demme's ""The Silence of the Lambs"" (1991). In other words, Shyamalan has the audience play a part in this film, which is a cool creative choice. And the film also presents a great, interesting, thematic, message, to it's viewers.Finally Overall, personally I think this is one of the Better Superhero genre films made recently. It's very original, it's made and put together well, the performances are very good, as well as all the characters, and the writing and direction is interesting to watch. The film is not Shyamalan's greatest work, but definitely one of his best. I think it is ""Ok"" to say Mr. Shyamalan has finally found his filmmaking magic again.

1102,RewatchersSalute,"Transmit, Reflect, and Refract",8,1 March 2019,"Background.
Once again, M. Night Shyamalan joins forces with Bruce Willis as David Dunn, a security guard with extraordinary ability, and James McAvoy's Kevin Wendell Crumb, the suspicious man with various personalities.Highlight!
Though not recommended but as matter of perspective, skipping a film or two might not interrupt satisfaction of a film; however, as far as M. Night Shyamalan's Eastrail 177 is concerned, the side-by-side comparison of all films in the trilogy makes it imperative to watch the pervious films to understand nuances and overall tone leading up to Glass. The previous films are thrilling, psychological observations of the human psyche in the superhuman form within two separate stories. 2000's Unbreakable is a dramatically, mysterious deconstruct of the superhero, and 2016's Split is a horrifying, explorative construct of the secret identity. In a nutshell, the original and its first sequel are just as great as standalone films as they are a part of a trilogy where as the final film, Glass succeeds solely as a resolution to its predecessors by entwining the two stories for the trilogy to magnify the appeal of gifted super beings and to reflect on the overlooked perception of the sub-genre, and thus, creating both an expansive world and yet something different in the era of the comic book adaptation.Remarkable?
With the release of the first trailer, the question of an expansive world and how the characters would interact with one another in this new space seemed to linger doubt from M. Night Shyamalan's uneven track record. Now that the credits have ended, what's the verdict one might ask? Certainly not what other superhero films have done in the past which is a good thing. As is sometimes the case with certain films, the characters do not always return as closely intact to how they once were in the original film but with good direction and acting, Glass assurances that the characters honor their psychological sensibilities throughout the film. Though time has pass, David Dunn is still just as stoic as Elijah Price (Samuel L. Jackson) is still just as crafty; and adding to that, an unpredictable, Kevin Wendell Crumb as the final puzzle piece to that interesting gathering the first trailer promised is quite fulfilling. The twist is alive and well.Here's to fighting for what's real. Always a war...",Glass

Glass takes it's time to tell a story about the three main characters here: David Dunn (Overseer), Elijah Price (Mr. Glass) and Kevin Wendell Crumb (The Beast). Out of the three, The Beast played by James McAvoy is steal the show.You have to give highest appreciation and loudest clap to McAvoy's acting prowess. He played each and single personality with perfection. Oh, and he shows around 20 personalities in the movie btw. Simply put, he is magnificent.The plot itself move slowly but they take you to get deeper into the three main characters and specially The Beast. If M.

The writing, the directing, the acting, the music and the cinematography... 19 years later we conclude an epic story. For all the people giving negative reviews I'm suspecting a few different things. You either did not realize it was a continuation and never saw unbreakable... orrrrr You are so used to seeing the shallow action packed movies with no depth that are currently littering the industry. This is an intelligent movie. You have to think! Bruce Willis, James McAvoy (Academy award winning acting) and Samuel L. Jackson just blew me away. When it ended I almost shed a tear. The last time a movie gave me that feeling was at the end of gladiator...... But the star of this movie where credit is due is M. Night Shyamalan!...

To bring back not only the main but also side characters from Unbreakable and Split is praiseworthy.There is also a lot to like about this film. From McAvoy's incredible performance, to a great background score, and an engaging screenplay. Yes, things go bizarre at the end and move at a rapid pace with events unfolding too quickly, but that should be expected if one has watched previous Shyamalan films.

1123,mckennapaul,Critics are wrong! Classic open Ending...,8,5 May 2019,"When the trailer for Split dropped I was skeptical, it was linked to the first film and now the trailer for Glass was revealed. I thought this was jumping on the superhero band waggon. Boy was I wrong... It takes the superhero premise, rips off the front cover and throws the rest out the window. It may seem like a superhero story but plays with the cliché to an interesting twist. Unbreakable was brilliant in its own right, Bruce Willis was fantastic! He's more captivating when he plays the vulnerable hero, Die Hard being the obvious example. Samuel L Jackson needs no introduction as Mr Glass, bringing effortless depth and charisma to any character on screen.Split was hit and miss but I enjoyed the story. I've always been a fan of psychological thriller and DID is the Holy Grail when it comes to psychology. James McAvoy is a good actor but surely he couldn't sustain the suspension of disbelief throughout the film. Split was better than expected if even a bit messy, but McAvoy and Anya Taylor Joy brought something to the table which kept it interesting. And, the story-arc between Bruce Willis's character and his son was a nice touch. Then the twist with Mr Glass played by the one and only Samuel L Jackson,nice I thought, real nice. This trilogy could be a refreshing spin on the over saturated, Disney infused superhero genre. And now I've seen the conclusion to the trilogy...The critics got it wrong... If you're expecting run of the mill superhero story you may be disappointed. The beauty of this film is that it takes all the tropes of a superhero story and plays around with it. You can see that M Night Shyamalan is a comic book fan, that he loves a beat down superhero rising up to fight for another day and that the villain is a mastermind bent on the destruction of the world that narrowly escapes death. But, that's not how this story ends. That's not what this story is like, it's placed in the real world, in real life where people are hurt, where people can die. No it doesn't have endless amounts of faceless cannon fodder for the good guys to kill, ten thousand bullets shot and no one gets hit. No these characters have heart, they have meaning, they have soul. It wasn't perfect by any means, some of the scenes with McAvoy's character switching personalities git a bit more at tknes and just came across cheesy. If it was reduced the amount of times he switched it would have given it more meaning when he did. It had nice details, like M Night's cameo linking his story to the last film. Nice touch. And that they put in the same actor who played Bruce Willis's son in Unbreakable, brilliant! The trilogy had its weak points but nevertheless the characters where likable, they wanted me to route for them. The story arc was interesting, it had mystery and I felt invested in what happened to the characters and that's why it was a fantastic end to a trilogy.",Glass

I can see how it could be from a certain point of view. Certain people were going into it with certain hopes and expectations on how it would play out and if something went awry from their ideas it would certainly throw them off.
I think because I put it off for so long and didnt think about it much until I had the spur urge to watch it tonight that I might have been disappointed too. So theres a form of bias from not expecting too much that not everyone can have going into it but it helped me enjoy it for sure.

I think I could have been happy with either way the plot went regarding whether the super powers were actually real or just delusion expressing the upper limits of human capabilities.
Debunking the powers would have had a cleaner ending.

1143,kimberley-macfarlane,Fantastic!,10,10 May 2019,"I honestly cannot understand why this movie is rated averagely and had poor reviews. I thought it was just brilliant! It's got the comic book movie element with the amazing Shaymalan twists! The acting was amazing, each character seemingly out doing the next. Though in the end, none can compare to James McCovey with his stellar portrayal of the multiple personality antagonist with a hidden good heart underneath them all. Every moment he is on screen, he completely mesmerises the audience with a genuinely authentic and what can only be challenging but chillingly believable portrayal of the characters many personalities. While he shined in every scene, the films final scenes (without giving too much away) for James were truly remarkable. The number of emotions that he portrays so convincingly while still effectively reaching the audience on an empathetic level was truly a joy to watch. It is not an easy character(s) to pull off and the wrong actor choice would essentially ruin the entire story of both 'Split' and 'Glass'. However McCovery manages to portray the incredibly complex role so well, it almost seems effortless. Samuel L Jackson plays the complicated title character Dr Glass, very well, adding the same levels of unexpected moves from Glass, that give the film its ultimate Shaymalam famous twists. After a few flops, it felt like M.Night had plateaued with 'The 6th sense' and was never going to achieve that caliber of film again. However it's the unique mix of these stories from the pre released films brought together in this informal trilogy and their unexpected relations mixed with a modern day classic comic book style film, that I firmly believes has brought him back to that high standard. I believe critics may have gone into this film biased and did not truly appreciate the previous film connections and the ultimate 'only the beginning' style story end that only leaves you wanting so much more! My only criticism would be that Bruce Willis's character seemed under used. I think he could be easily mistaken as just not meeting the performance levels of his co stars, but personally, it seemed more that his character had far less interaction and storyline than was expected. It was good to see the use of his son to portray his story though and was great to see the same actor, Spencer Treat Clark, reprise the role. I'd seen him recently in Agents of SHIELD and he has a unique quality often not seen in such successful child actors. He was highly praised for his roles as a child yet went through his schooling and university before acting again. He still has the connection and raw and relatable talent that we saw in 'Unbreakable' and in his role in 'Gladiator'. His characters use and portrayal in this film was well done and did great things for the Willis character storyline. Overall I thought the film was brilliant and has the unique ability to appeal to a wide fan base. Definitely give this movie a chance!",Glass

1145,charlespeacock,A boring walkout experience,1,15 June 2019,"Having just watched Split last week ( which I thoroughly enjoyed ) I was hoping for another engrossing enjoyable watch. There is no denying James McAvoy has a deep talent and emotional range that engages the viewer. He also had it in this movie, but in my opinion the Beast was overdone, even though it needed to be brought out - it got ridiculous. Ridiculous, that is the adjective that popped up for me as I continued to watch this mess of a movie. MNS made a cameo appearance in the film in which it was obvious he knew he was being filmed and overplayed his celebrity in an unnatural way. Bruce Willis could just as well have been a cameo side note, because he gave a one dimensional grim cardboard performance that had no emotional depth or substance. In Split Betty Buckley was very believable as the doctor with her fine acting - even though you had to suspend your disbelief, she helped you do that. In Glass, the doctor here and the premise as well that she was operating on was simplistic, flawed and carried no weight in a naive fashion. She is another actor at least here, who gave a flat expressionless performance for the whole movie. Samuel L Jackson, who is still a special actor in real life is over 70, but they used a made up younger actress to play his mother. That was hard to digest, but she was just another actor in the movie wasted to make a childlike naive moral statement that in the end was an anti climatic disappointment. Anya Taylor Joy, fit so well in Split, but here her darting nervous eyes and feigned emotions are unsettling, and why the doctor would let her get close enough to hold hands with a disturbed killer are another ploy on suspending your disbelief. Perhaps to make a moral statement the film maker wants to get away with a wishy washy sympathetic soft stance, but it once again betrays a naivete that to me is nauseating. I get the Philly backdrop, it's the style - but it did nothing but add a shallow background to a thorough flop of a movie. In the end when Glass' mother, Casey and Joseph are sitting on a bench in what I assume to be 30th Street Station, they are waiting for a reaction as everything that transpired has been downloaded and streamed to the immediate world. Suddenly, it comes through and everyone around them is engrossed with their phones and the message that will change the world! And then the comic book store scene. If I had been in the movie theater I would have walked out. James McAvoy and Samuel L Jackson saved the movie in a small way because the rest of the movie was utterly ridiculous.

He tells his story's in a slow way, not much action. If you like that, you will enjoy the film. But you must watch Unbreakable and Split before to understand the film.",Glass
1153,fernandodelpozoc,Disappointing,4,19 January 2019,A weak movie. Bad plot. Too bad they ended up great characters as the beast and the overseer in such lame way.,Glass
1154,thomassoomers,Great movie with AMAZING acting!,9,20 May 2021,"Even though the movie is a bit slow, the acting and the cinematography are outstanding. Especially the acting from James McAvoy. The way he portrays 24 different personalities is just amazing.Glass ties in Unbreakable and Split perfectly. The stories merge really well together. They were even able to use all the original (most relevant) actors from the previous movies.If you want to watch a fully packed action movie, this might not be the one. However, if you are going for great cinematographically pleasing movie with a somewhat unexpected ending this is definitely the one.",Glass
1155,kinayates-63547,Was Good Could have been Better. SPOLIERS,7,20 January 2019,"I'm a M Night fan. Loved Lady in the water when critics didn't. He has had some that I couldn't get behind such as The Happening and The Village. Now here we are at Glass. The movie was good but something seems to be missing and to kill all the characters at end was not a good idea to me. If what Mr. Glass said was true, which was, Bruce Willis character was only using 1% of his strength then he should have survived. James M character definitely should have remained for he was just introduced into the trilogy and we get to know more of his story of who he really is. Not sure what made M Night go in that direction but wish he could have changed it. if he did the movie would have been great! Then you have this new secret society who should have been introduced in Split some sort of way. The movie was a bit choppy but it was enjoyable. I never listen to critics I just can't. The movie is worth spending 10.00 by bucks on",Glass

1157,The_Technical_Revolutionary,Amazing Movie,10,17 January 2019,"This was an amazing offering. Another movie the critics seem to have reviewed without bothering to even watch, I think. I really liked the first two in this series, but Glass is just a step above. The story, the message, the characters, for me this was as close to perfect as a movie can be. As written by others here, this isn't a standard cookie cutter super hero movie. Thankfully. We have enough of them, and they're starting to get a bit stale.This trilogy is a modern cult classic. I do, very much, hope that this universe is explored in future offerings, and I also hope that we can get some new critics who actually take the time to watch the movies they are paid to review.",Glass

The script itself is poor, role of sarah paulson was not at all required in this. it should have been a straight out fight between the overseer vs the horde but mr.shyamalan had other plans.
The unbreakable, split were really good and could challenge Marvel or DC but with this sequel it is clear they cant.David dunn had so little to do in this move, james macvoy was brilliant but they both cant lift the movie up with its poor execution and story.",Glass

I concur with all the 8/10 to 10/10 reviews except for the fact it is such a shame that this is the finale
A continuation could have been done here very much so
I appreciate the twist at the end and get the Director is known for such a style but I cant help wonder if it had the success of Split (im not sure if it actually had or not ) wold it have found another instalment
Anywhoo it is a fantastic movie and probably one of my favourite in this Genre
Of course as previously mentioned bye other reviewers James Mc Evoy absolutely knocks it out of the park with all his characters,Bruce Willis should really have as good roles as this unlike the Turkeys he has had over the years as he has Massive potential to be aligned with big films in a co host role
Samuel l Jackson is as always on point he really is top 5 Actors of all time and does not get that credit deserved for me

Unbreakable and Split, two of Shyamalan's best films ever, are must see before going!! And strangely, pulling the two entirely different stories together; works!! Bruce Willis, James Mcavoy, Samuel L. Jackson, Sarah Paulson, Anya Taylor-Joy and another that would be a spoiler to mention, are fantastic!! Great story, excellent performances with the best sound/sound effects ever! The tension is gripping enough, the added very original music and warping sound effects make it chair GRIPPING!! M. Night Shyamalan, I salute you in your recent string of A+ films after being trashed for a couple that fans and critics hated expecting Sixth Sense/Signs terror and twists! And the critics didn't like Signs!! Idiots!! So yes, I love the movie, A+!!!",Glass
1166,kittypryde_shadowcat,Great Movie,10,20 January 2019,This movie explains amazingly the background of the three main characters. It involves the audience into the situations they went through. I recommend to watch and analyze it. James McAvoy does an Oscar worthy performance.,Glass
1167,kershekm-91027,Slow and weak on any believable theme,2,23 January 2019,Many who like super hero genre's might like this movie. I am not into such genre's although I did like the Superman movies of the 80's. This movie was dreadfully slow that I really was not interested in following the plot. The acting by McAvoy was good but become way overdone. I was waiting for this movie to end.,Glass
1168,charisremzi,Some superb acting overshadowed by some serious flaws,5,9 April 2020,"When I watched the end of Split, I was so excited to learn it tied into the Unbreakable-verse. Unbreakable was a fantastic film, that I continue to rewatch from time to time. Unfortunately, Glass doesn't live up to the expectations set by its predecessors.Before mentioning the cons, it is a crime to not mention the acting shown by James McAvoy in this film. As with Split, McAvoy continues to stand out in Glass with his excellent ability to transform his entire being with each personality shift; from the unease that accompanies Patricia to the sorrow when Kevin makes an appearance. His performance in this film alone made it such a watchable experience, and it helped carry the film along.A large issue I had with this film was its clunky exposition, especially in the latter half of the plot. The film had some moments that are quite clever, however the film prides itself so much on being clever that it spends too much time trying to show you exactly what made each moment so clever. I feel certain elements brought in at the end were solely to keep the plot twisting and turning (it's a ritual in our household to guess the plot twist in an Shyamalan film) but lacked any depth or true meaning for me as a viewer. I also felt that several times there were a lot of plot holes that I had to try and shake off and suspend my disbelief, though this is perhaps more of a personal flaw than a true criticism of the film.The introduction at the end of a ""secret society"" that seeks to extinguish superhumans felt forced and unnecessary, especially as they were revealed and then only moments later shown to have been outwitted by Mr Glass. I would have been more accepting of this concept had it been teased and hinted at previously, and not just chucked in at the last hurdle of the film.The starter premise of the movie to me was fantastic; the exploration that these superhuman characters we have come to know may actually just be mentally ill is an intriguing idea and something I wanted to explore in more depth. Sadly this message gets lost and abandoned by the midway point and instead it dissolves into a murky finale of action scenes.Overall, the film had a solid premise and some brilliant moments of tension. Unfortunately, the film just doesn't quite stick the landing as well as I had hoped. I would still recommend all Unbreakable fans to give it a watch, just in case.",Glass
1169,aminbeydouno,It's ok,6,2 April 2019,"Yeah its ok and that's annoying because Unbreakable is my favorite movie. I wasn't expecting this movie to be better but I expected something better than what we got.I went into the movie wanting an Unbreakable sequel but its more of a split sequel featuring Unbreakable stuff in it. James mcavoy is really good in this movie, he gives the best performance. Samuel L Jackson is pretty good but sometimes he's really goofy. Bruce willis' performance was mediocre. they incude some scenes from deleted scene from Unbreakable and those were the best part of the movie.The movie was pretty ok up until the ending. The ending is really bad. There are 4 plot twists ranging from good plot twists to AWFUL plot twists.In conclusion it was an ok movie on its own but as an Unbreakable sequel it could be better.",Glass

Night shyamalan did a fantastic job depicting the story of this superheroes in a real world. SO much so that I started beleiving at some point that maybe this people are crazy and delusional. Jame Mcavoy was absolutely brilliant playing kevin and his personnalities, he was definitely the highlight of the movie. Nonetheless, there was some things that i personnaly didnt enjoy such as one of the twist at the end which felt disconnected with the overall storyline.And also,I would have liked to see more of Mr glass in the first act of the movie. Still, a very entertaining and enjoyable movie that I would recommand watching !",Glass

Unbreakable was a masterpiece that brought back my love for shamalamadingdong and got me excited for split. Split's script was written around the same time as Unbreakable so the script itself had a lot of that shamallama charm, the cinematography on the other hand felt lowkey generic, especially after watching Unbreakable right beforehand, but it was still entertaining and James McAvoy did an amazing job and truly felt possessed by multiple different people. Then there's glass.. I was enjoying myself up until the last 20 minutes, even during those first 1 hour and 40 minutes of the of the movie I would think to myself ""Bruce Willis' acting isn't the best and Samuel Jackson seems like he's being held back.""

The way everything came together with the story was pure genius! Definitely M. Night Shyamalan's greatest work yet. Anyone who watched this movie and gave it a bad rating must not have seen the others in the series. I will buy these movies and watch them over again and again.

1180,alangarciia,STUNNING,10,23 January 2019,"Well, first of all, I was very excited about this movie and been waiting for it a very long time.
I strongly recommend that you watch the first two movies before.
No spoilers intended but, at first, it might be a little boring for some people (specially AVENGERS FANS) this, as the previous movies, it's not a typical superheroes movie. You won't see the typical thirty-pointless battles per movie where the city gets totally destroyed over and over with no consequences whatsoever, or the overwhelming special effects going through all the movie til you cant take more and your done and want to get out of the movie theatre.
I think this trilogy is a must watch films series, and proves that superheroes can be really deep and interesting characters instead of the usual crap from Marvel. So don't listen to the haters 😉PLUS I have to say, the end is amazing, I really didn't see that coming. A deserved (ending?) to the trilogy.As I said; if you haven't , stop reading me and go watch the previous two movies. Then go to the cinema and enjoy this masterpiece.",Glass

User reviews are a far better source as they come from regular people like you and me who spend our hard-earned money looking to be entertained, whereas critics are paid to tell you what you should believe.

I only watched this movie because there was nothing else playing that turned my crank tonight.
I went in not expecting much really, and fluctuated, ratings wise, through out the movie. Most of the movie I was at a 5 or 6 rating. Three quarters of the way through I was very ""into it"" and it had moved to an 8 plus. But with only 2 or 3 minutes left I was disgusted and was ready to give it a 1.
But then the ending blew me away and I ended up with a feel good solid 10 rating .

The highlight of the movie is James McAvoy's performace, playing The Hoarde. It was incredible to see him tranforming personas instantly. I was absolutely mind-blown.
I'll definitely be checking out the other two movies in the trilogy at some point.",Glass
1186,goofydoofy,Brilliant end to the trilogy.,10,18 January 2019,I would say critics are just plain wrong about this movie. It is so refreshing in this day and age to watch a superhero movie that is not only grounded and real but also clever with interesting choices with regard to plot from start to finish. This movie has the ending that will probably divide fans of unbreakable but I personally loved it. Don't read rotten tomatoes reviews before watching this movie. See it for yourself and form an opinion.,Glass
1187,aidanroberts-93526,Glass review,8,22 April 2019,"I saw Glass earlier this year and enjoyed it. Every scene was made to build the story until the end. The only problem was a very minor one that I could find. Samuel L Jackson did an amazing preference as always but he did nothing in the first half of the film. The main characters, like in the past 2 movies, were likeable and a lot of effort was made into making this film. In the end when all the main characters died was a twist that I didn't see coming.",Glass
1188,tipodaspiaggia,When you serve leftovers to an impromptu dinner..,5,11 February 2019,"I am a great admirer of M Night. Watched them all. This movie, though, felt like a last-minute dinner thrown to an old friend who showed up at the door. A bit of lasagna, a half-breast of chicken, and grocery store's sushi. Wills and Jackson are usually timeless, but this time, hey looked like they just came out of retirement, following the stock market's terrible performance of the last six months. McAvoy-incredible actor-went beyond the call of duty, looking ridiculous at times. The plot? The lines? I can't find a word, bad enough to describe the general disappointment. The movie starts well, excellent directorship, as usual, but I started looking at the watch with 40 mins left to the end. Predictable, stupid-to some extent, felt again, like a re-heated dinner. Cheap, tasteless, improvised; just another way to put something in the belly prior to going to sleep. A prosciutto sandwich would have done it. What a disappointment. My 14-yr-old son would have come up with a better storyline. Seriously. Was this the best you could come up with?",Glass

This one was not one of those bombs we have seen in the past. The big twist in this actually fits the film well. The visuals and sound create a very unique ambiance to this rather unique gritty and realistic super hero movie. The main three did a great job acting even Bruce Willis was good. But Mcavoy is a superhuman His ability to transform through several personalities each with its own quirks, body language, voice right down to vocal cadence and they do this several times with no place to cut in between. this guy is an acting beast and deserve recognition from the academy though this film is not an Oscar contender his performance is. Great film superior cast and M.Night didn't screw it up what a great way to start the year.",Glass
1190,letswatchamovie,Much better than some say,6,20 January 2019,"To be perfectly honest I don't think this movie has fallen nearly as short as some are saying.
The cinematography is fantastic, even more so then it was in Split, the performances from James Mcovy(probably didn't spell that right) Bruce Willis, Samual Jackson, and the rest of the cast are great, and the writing, clunky expositional dialogue aside, still manages to be solid.
We all know that M Night Shaymalan has had many disasters in his filmagraphy, but with Split and Glass, I think he has gotten himself out of the ""Dark Ages"" of his career, and is set up to make some quality work in the future. But hey, this is M Night, and there's always a twist with him.
Over all I will say that this film is pretty solid. I can't give it more than a 7/10do to some odd camera work, dialogue, fight choreography, and editing choices, but I think it is entertaining enough, and personally left me satisfied. Some may criticize the ending, and I understand there point, but I think it was reasonable well done. That's all I have to say.",Glass
1191,masontwin,And the Oscar goes to M. Night,10,19 January 2019,"Glass is an absolutely phenomenal film. M. Night has outdone himself, James McAvoy clearly deserves the best actor award. Bruce Willis, Samuel L. Jackson and Sarah Paulson were just as great. As usual, M. Night blindsided everyone with the ending but I loved it, you'll just have to see for yourself. Glass will easily be one of the best films of 2019 and the masterpiece of M. Night Shyamalan.",Glass
1192,leo-37265,First review on a movie hope u like it,4,26 January 2019,"Overall it is a good movie but it is so frustrating for diehard fans how it tries to make you forget about all of the horrible things Mr. Glass and The Horde have done and it tries to make you feel bad for the. Like all of a sudden Casy loves The Horde even though he literally ate her two friends alive. What I think is sweet is it really shows a mother's love for a son, Elisha killed at least a couple thousand people including kids but his mom is still down on her nees crying when he dies. Not enough fighting between the beast and David. It also had a huge opportunity for a plotwist with the ginger lady ""you will know what I meen when you watch it"".",Glass

1194,orangevigor,Brilliant,4,24 February 2019,"Having not seen Unbreakable, or split, glass maybe a bit confusing for some. This movie, tho smartly directed and written, suffers terribly from a low quality presence.It feels almost as if a student film project,given that it focuses directly on the story and not much else.
James McAvoy is as brilliantly over the top,as is Bruce Willis underlying his role.
I highly recommend Glass,and think M. Night Shyamalan is a very rare director.
There is an abundance of mildly talented writers and directors in California,who would benefit from paying attention.",Glass
1195,orangevigor,Hichcockian,4,24 February 2019,"Glass is the 3rd movie in a storyline,and having not seen Unbreakable, or Split Will leave most people on the fence. Though James mcavoy's over the top and brilliant acting overshadows the exact opposite of Bruce Willis's role and character, this movie is a definite must-see Forex complete focus on story and not effects.
The only negative that is immediately obvious,is the small budget feeling of the overall film, and its presence,which is almost like a student project.
I, for one, thank M Night Shyamalan for not being a stereotypical writer/director. Hollywood seems to push projects based on the age old theory of ""the public is dumb"",and ANYTHING new or genuine is a rarity.
Sure,this type of storytelling is rather hitchcockian, but at least it's extremely engaging. This director is someone most directors should watch more often.
The mere psychology, or suspension of disbelief of the SUPERHERO,and as a basis for ground zero is a smart idea.
Definitely see this movie if you pretend are a writer or actor.",Glass
1196,MahmoudFEB,Glass : Review,4,24 April 2019,"After the first two movies this one had great potential, sadly it falls short due to several factors, mainly plot holes and trying to force shocking twists on you, Sadly by the time the ""twist"" appears you've reached a point where you don't care that much anymore and the twist isn't even that good too.
Acting was good mainly by McAvoy, he seamlessly transition between each personality in a really good way.
Sadly the ending wasn't fitting after a very good two movies before it.
If you've seen the previous two movies then watch this one to get a bit of closure I guess, Otherwise it's a below average movie in my opinion.",Glass
1197,DebbyWhite,Great superhero movie because it has a soul,10,20 January 2019,Ignore the critics. This movie appeals to people who liked The Watchmen. M Night makes the emotions and souls of the superheroes' motives the driving force of the movie. It's all shades of gray where you have squint to see the real story that discerns the area between good and evil. The backdrop is examining how superheroes fit into society. The tale is slowly told through character introspection- including the supporting characters. Don't look for lots of Matrix-type fights and blasting weapons. The tension is all character driven.,Glass
1198,JosephPolanco7777,Glass was amazing!,10,14 February 2020,"This trilogy was twenty years in the making and was absolutely amazing. The reason people shoot it down is because the fight scenes aren't like Marvel and DC which is utter crap. It was it's own movie with original superheroes. When the beast had fought the overseerer it was great not seeing a huge fight like the Avengers or Justice League. The ending was fantastic and made perfect sense when Mr. Glass sent those recordings to the website which helped confirm that superheroes exist. ""This wasn't a limited edition. It was an origin story. """,Glass
1199,joeyryver,M. Nigh Shambolictatalan,4,24 October 2019,Whatever his name is should just quit. The story is convoluted and complicated and for no reason.The cheerleaders and hence the beginning of the film were eye candy though,Glass
1200,suprabh,The superhero story we all deserve,9,21 January 2019,"I don't often write reviews here. But this is one of those that compelled me to write one. I am also going to comment on the ending without going into spoilers.Let me start by saying - If Unbreakable was a movie way too ahead of it's times, then Glass is a movie way too late for it's times (and I mean it as a compliment, which I will explain). Glass is a film which is essentially an origin story of all that is about to follow in the universe of superheros and super villains. The fact of the matter is that as a generation we have already witnessed the expansion of this superhero DC/Marvel universe (for the better or worse of it). This is why it takes a little bit of time and thinking in understanding what the ending suggests.among other things, Glass really is not just the beginning of the superheroverse but also a commentary on the origin of what drives these superpowers in the first place. Why does a Super hero become one and why does a super villain what he really is.Structured like Unbreakable- it is more of a character portrayal than a gadget infested super hero vs villain fight over some New York skyscraper (well done, Mr. M Night Shyamalan for that clever dig on the fast food entertainment). Shyamalan goes into what he does best- setting the environment of each character (David Dunn could have been done more justice though).It is really reminiscent of that feeling of reading through a comic book and letting your own imagination do the work.Flaws: Yes there are many. And they are mainly in the last 45 minutes regarding the security of the mental facility and yes they will bother you. But when the climax hits and you give it enough time to sink in, you will realize that that's the victory of the film.If you haven't watched Unbreakable or Split- I highly recommend you to do so before you check this one out, because that allows for the bigger picture to make sense. Its beautiful how Shyamalan has stitched the story together. The only thing that comes close to it in the popcorn comic movie world is the X Men/Wolverine story.Overall: If you are a true comic fan and you know how to watch a super hero movie beyond the graphics and the noise, you will live this one. A rare original superhero movie.P.S. I am sure James McAvoy will again be criminally ignored at the awards just like the last time for Split, even though this is yet another class act from him.",Glass

As with Split, his transitions between personalities is seamless. Like, Samuel L Jackson, he also makes you care about the character despite being a villain. I cried a bit during both of their scenes. Second, I LOVED Unbreakable and Split so I had high hopes. However, this felt sloppy. The beginning was strong and everything I hoped for. Spencer Treat Clark reprisal of his role was perfectly intertwined. Then Sarah Paulson's character arrived and it was downhill from there. Not attacking her acting it's just that the entire storyline with her character was annoying and full of holes. There were so many chances to save it but it didn't go those routes. It felt like a completely different writer. I only rate it so high because of the abilities of the actors to still make it an emotional journey.",Glass

Night Shyamalan has managed to create characters that are unique within the mythos of superheroes and villains. As I was watching Glass, I had that feeling of reading a comic book and following along every panel. And I think that the story is brilliant to the extent where I found myself actually caring for the villains. It's tough to do in a story where the villains themselves don't feel like they're the bad guys but the conflict was felt. Just how the story all came together, I truly enjoyed it and watching Unbreakable and then Split before this one will really help cause the story comes full circle.",Glass

It explains more about the purpose of Glass and delivers fullfilment of this purpose.I think people are wrong about Casey character being wasted, wrong about this movie not being explanatory or satisfactory enough. And that.s because they consider this a trilogy. I.m pretty sure it.s not. A glipse of what is to come is that fraction of a second when Casey looks at the cover of the comic book. Another hint is the scene whith Joseph Dunn in the gym.
One more thing is the structure of the movie. The major revelations in the end is that Glass deceived everyone so his plan would work. The thing is that the movie itself tricks you, distracts you from Glass.
IMHO the lack of focus on Glass in the first half is on purpose and this is what makes the movie so brilliant.
Anyway, I think it.s a movie that need to be watched couple of times to get all it.s meanings.",Glass

Trilogy, we're lucky we got all of them. Unbreakable became a success years after it's box office run and evolved in to a true cult classic.
Split, until the end we didn't even know we were watching essentially Unbreakable 2. Think about how good that swerve felt, how good it felt to realize that there would have to be a part 3.
These were sad characters that had led lives unfulfilled, sad or tortured, but for a brief moment in time every spotlight, all eyes and all attention are on them. They bask in their moment.

Shayamalan focused on the things that truly mattered such as dialogue, character development, and plot.Willis and McAvoy gave award winning performances, although McAvoy stole the show with his personality fluid acting. It was simply incredible to see this man cycle through 4-5 identities in a single shot. There are no words to provide the praise McAvoy's performance commands.The plot was rich and Shayamalan didnt disappoint with his twists and turns. His mastery of the sleight of hand left me completely off balance yet pleasantly surprised.This is Shayamalan's best picture since The Sixth Sense and I could easily watch this a half a dozen times and still get the same thrills as the first experience.My only utter disappointment are the highly underrated and over-criticized opinions of the mainstream critics who wouldn't acknowledge a superior film even if it but them on their rear end.

The big (second) showdown between characters takes places on a front-lawn..wow! The room that's flooded with water has a dry mattress in it...

If you haven't watched the first two, then you will enjoy this movie more. I know makes no sense, but let me explain.The plot of Glass is sort of toying with the idea if these three heroes are special. Or they're just regular people that are crazy and believe that they are special. This is why there are no special effects and CGI present in the movie. The director makes heroes and us doubt their supernatural abilities. But he doesn't realise that WE HAVE ALREADY SEEN THE PREVIOUS MOVIES. And they have proved quite fairly that these guys are pretty damn special! He has already shown us how strong David (Bruce Willis) is and how The Horde (James Mcavoy) can climb walls. So the movie tries quite unsuccessful to make us doubt of their abilities. Why? To shock us with an unexpected twist that they actually are special? We already know that they are. You have already done this trick in the first two movies Mr M. Night Shyamalan.Besides the half-baked plot, there are several unconvincing characters, emotions that feel forced, awkward fighting scenes, and a mental hospital with a worse security than a university library.Although, James Mcavoy makes the movie worth watching. His acting of multiple characters had already floored my in Split. I strongly recommend watching it. Unlike this dog's breakfast, Split was an absolute delight.",Glass

What should have been the easiest part of the movie, the action/fight scenes, he failed at miserably. We all know he makes slow movies, to break up that slowness there are action sequences, but those were so underwhelming themselves. If he just had gotten a decent fight choreographer, this movie could've been epic. Great concepts throughout the movie though. It was still decent, 6.5/10",Glass

Bruce Willis doesn't really have much to do which is a shame, seriously the guy had like 20 lines in the whole film but James McAvoy smashes it again and Samuel L. Jackson is silent the 1st half of the movie but does a solid job as the mastermind in the back half. There are 2 twists, one that most of us figured out after watching Split, and another that will unite everyone against one common enemy.

I went to see it last night with my best mate and an hour into the film... nothing happens. You basicly get introduced to characters you allready know. This makes this movie so boring and dull. The storyline was pure dogfarts so I was waiting for some good old action. Nope. You get James McAvoy turning into the most pathetic version of the Hulk a couple of times. David Dunn is such a waste of a character in this movie. He didnt get any sort of revelation, where as Mr Glass did. But there were too many plotholes in his evil schemes.
And God don't get me started on the end. They go for the ""evil society"" plot twist. And try to go for some millenial bs exposure on social media.

This movie is not like any other superhero movie I have seen. M. Night brings such a realistic bend. From the fight scenes, which are played out like it truly would be in real life, the conflict through the characters of battling the belief in real super powers, to the whole demeanor of the movie, it has such a realistic and literal vibe to the plot that sets it apart from all the other superhero movies and making the audience truly believe that the concept of superpowers could actually be real. Its stunningly executed from the cinematography, score, color scheme, plot and all of the above. Not to Mention James McAvoy's acting was presented stunningly.

1238,venny-laturette,A Very Shyamalan's Way To End a Trilogy,8,17 March 2019,"Glass is how Shyamalan shows that he knows how to end the trilogy in his way.
The film is the final for Unbreakable trilogy, about the super people in the creator's vision. In terms for Psycology effect and action, it is more mild the its predecessor but it is definitely still interesting to follow and will keep your eyes on the screen.It is smart to make the location for these 3 super people (Glass, Dunn & Crumb) to meet at the mental institution as patients, it's believable, it's perfect to build the tension.Dr. Staple (Sarah Paulson) , this character is one that trying to play with the mind in here, the logics built and told by Staple are quite solid for the viewer to see if it can shake Dunn & Crumb's belief. Glass in the other hand fights against Staple to win the battle, he determines not to lose what he has built and believe all along. The fight is enhance with clipsof memories from the characters. The fight is brought until the end with all its twist. the end is the best part of the film.The actors shouldn't be questioned, all committed. Extra kudos for James McAvoy for the multiple characters and Sarah Paulson, she is very believable for the antagonist here. Also it is good for reminiscing to see some actors from Unbreakable still able to join the film as their original character such as Spencer Treat Clark as Joseph, Dunn's Son and Shyamalan even get Bostin Christopher who played as Comic Book Clerk, a supporting character but pretty important for this film. And of course Shyamalan also takes part in the film.
It is not strong as the other first two but Shyamalan sure has succeed creating film with twist storyline of his style. And he can keep all connected and relevant from Unbreakable, Split and Glass.by: @vennysaarce",Glass

I think the writer took the middle path, not to overtly try to please the viewer or totally yank the rug from under the feet. That makes me think about one of the main teachings of the Bhagavad Gita, to not ever be too sad or happy, just to see the oneness in everything. I think this movie was going for a oneness philosophy, the more I think back on it. It was revealed at the end the psychologist was part of a shadowy group that did not want superheroes, or villains. Maybe because those are the extremes, and those are only needed during extreme times. An anti-superhero superhero movie! That might also be why you see some great actors in this movie, and maybe some not-so-great actors, the Bhagavad Gita teaches to just act, not coming to judgements or conclusions. We can enjoy the not-so-great actors just as much as the great ones! Also in America right now, we have the polarized Left and Right wing parties.

Finally, something worth watching, along with all the suspense of M. Night Shyamalan in revealing and tying together the storyline from the past, present, and a possible future. I'm so tired of all the mainstream Disney-produced superhero trilogies that have lost sight of the comic book vision/feel, and are just squeezing out as many movies and as much related merchandise from any given franchise as is possible for the sole purpose of financial gain. The individual and combined stories of The Horde, The Overseer, and Mr. Glass fully encompass the true nature and appeal of the fantasy world of comic books, superheroes, supervillians, how meaningful they are to so many, and how cool it would be if they were real. It's not the same boring fight scenes and battles of good vs evil over and over with all the expensive special effects. It is dark, disturbing, intriguing, exciting, and intense all at the same time. There is no rooting for the good guys to beat out the bad guys, you are not forced to choose a side and no side wins or loses. It is just about the fantasy of comic books come to life, and the questions of 'what if...?' An epic ending/beginning to many possible stories. I hope M. Night continues to add to this story, but if he decides not to I would be content with this trilogy. Sometimes less of a good thing means more in the end.",Glass

BUT: This one's a disgrace. The first third is acceptable in terms of drama, story and building tension. But when the ""psychiatrist"" starts babbling about nonsensical pseudosciences, it gets really ugly. You could now say: But what about the pseudoscience of other films? Right, but at least they try harder, Glass's line of argument is more like a B-film with P-stars. And that's the main problem: the whole thing seems to have come about hastily and without sufficient budget and time. I don't want to spoil too much, but Mr. Glasses ""brilliant"" behavior is absolutely implausible. Psychiatry only has one nurse at a time? The cameras only work when Glass wants them to? Glass replaces the glasses that were supposed to bundle the laser for his surgery? And so on.
And the ""action"" scenes are the worst I've seen in a long time (if you watch the movie, for example: the stupidly behaving cops, the plastic container that gets cracked for no reason, the ridiculous wrestling ...). I know it's not an action movie with any CG effects, but at least a minimum standard of believable choreography should be reached (it's even worse than the worst The Walking Dead scenes). Implausible action and behavior, anti-climactic dramaturgy, bad execution. Very sad when you're a fan of Shyamalan movies. It's insulting to be honest.
And finally: If you look at all the 10/10 ratings, watch what they are writing. All they say is: It is the best movie ever. Without any arguments. Fanboys or employees of the movie creators, it seems.",Glass

I was so excited to watch this film and I did enjoy it, even though it was more in the vein of Unbreakable than it was that of Split. It was different than what had been marketed, not action packed, more of a slow burn.

Do not waste your money on this garbage. Do not support this lazy, garbage-filled excuse of a movie. Better to give your money to a stranger - or toss your cash into a fire just to watch it burn.

1248,cryfenril-38465,Ce n'est pas un film sur les héros!,7,4 February 2019,"Loosely translated, this is not a movie about superheroes.In fact, I still haven't figured out what it is, to be honest. The obvious answer is that it's a psychological thriller with supernatural overtones... but when has Shyamalan ever done the obvious? No, I think it may possibly be something quite different.I think it's possible that this movie is Shyamalan's condemnation of society as we know it - after all, the ""hero"" (David) meets his end at the hands of the ""authorities"", and the overarching concept is one of hiding and destroying Those Who Are Not Normal.Could this be a social statement?Could Shyamalan mean this as a warning about a possible uprising after the three-ring circus our socio-political system has become? Is it a call to action before the REAL enemy with the clover tattoos has total control?Maybe I'm giving him too much credit for subtlety... but it sure feels like we're supposed to see something of ourselves in each of the three focal figures and sympathize with them in different ways.And James McAvoy, oh dear me - if I didn't already love him I'd be a fan after this one. Extraordinary. The only conceit they resort to in his multiple portrayals is brown eyes and a bit of prosthetics work for the Beast; everything else is pure body language and facial nuances, and he does it so well it's terrifying.The movie is worth sitting through even if it's just to see his performance.With all that in mind, this is unfortunately a terribly flawed creation in many ways.The dialogue is dreadful, the pacing is bizarre, and the overall scenery is watered-down to the point of being boring. Casey is a cartoony rendition of Stockholm Syndrome Gone Wild; she, David's son, and Elijah's mother are pulled into the story without truly adding ANYTHING of any value to it except their presence; and there's too much time spent showing off crazy camera angles and extreme close-ups, and not enough time filling in great big GAPING holes in the plot.It depends far too much on our suspension of disbelief, but gives us very little to hang our collective jackets on. All in all, one of the most poorly-executed movies he's ever signed off on.And yet, I cannot help but be intrigued by it. It stays in my mind and wiggles its way into my subconscious. Is Shyamalan really a genius after all? Has he hidden a deep, world-altering message in a wretched shambles of a movie so that the general public will spurn it... but so that the people who NEED to get the message will see it and recognize it for what it is? The thronged masses in the train station at the end, staring numbly at their electronic devices, being exposed to the presence of something unpredictable and dangerous that's been hiding under their very noses - is that us?The simple possibility that this is, in fact, the case makes me like this movie more by the moment.",Glass
1249,asawa-20086,Good movie...could have been way better,7,19 January 2019,McAvoy's character(s) are awesome. He is the highlight of the film just as he was in Split. Willis' character doesn't really have much to him here or in Unbreakable. I really wanted them to progress their powers more but it didn't happen which is the second biggest letdown of the movie. The biggest letdown is that all three of them apparently die at the end. What the...?? The twist on Eastrail 177 was pretty thin too. In conclusion while I still enjoyed the film it was disappointing to have so little payoff and kill off all three main characters. It does have an open ended finale but I will have to wait and see where it goes next to consider myself a fan.,Glass

I only want to briefly comment here to reiterate what everyone else is saying: The critics are wrong.This is a unique film which follows the surprise sequel to Unbreakable- arguably the best M. Night Shyamalan film to date. The sequel, Split, was an entertaining take on a psychological thriller; however, Glass takes it to a whole new level.
Glass is a psychological/superhero/horror flick unlike any other movie I've seen. Shyamalan perfectly ties in necessary components from the first two films in order to drive Glass to its surprising conclusion.You should stop reading reviews immediately and go see it for yourself. If you haven't seen Unbreakable or Split, you need to watch them first or you will not enjoy all that Glass has to offer.",Glass

Jackson makes glass remains an interesting character, but bruce willis is the real problem, unfortunately it is not up to the other two protagonists, but in my opinion most of the film's problems are fixed with the revelation of the glass plan at the end of the film.

The characters were clear to see despite not having the props we had became used to in Split.The beginning of the film was a decent introduction and took the time to explain how the characters path were due to cross. The movie lost its way in the middle, with the story line struggling it came across as rushed towards a finale which I felt we never really got.The ending is M.

1258,jacobfeltner,An Overall Disappointing Conclusion,7,18 January 2019,"I absolutely love Unbreakable and Split. I couldn't have been more excited going into this movie. While the first 2/3rds are quite good and set up the movie nicely, an ending way out of left field really hurts this film overall.The Pros:
M. Night really puts his directing skills on display again in this film. There are some spectacular shots in this film that make the viewing experience that much better. The acting is also really good by pretty much everyone in the film (shyamalan is even passable!). Once again the first 2/3rds of this film is pretty great, and sets up a potentially epic ending. The film did a good job of getting me invested from the start.The Cons:
I can't say it enough. The ending. The ending. The ending. While M. Night's other entries in this trilogy (Unbreakable, Split) are very well written and have genuine surprise and wit about them, this film has none. I can't remember the last time a films ending let me down so much. It's very out of nowhere, underdeveloped, and just doesn't feel like it has a place in this story.Overall, if you're a fan of the series I'd recommend you go see this. How could you not? Don't get your hopes too high though. A riveting slow burn set up ultimately leads to an unsatisfying ending to this film, and a disservice to this trilogy.",Glass

1263,nisanyetkin,a mess,1,11 March 2021,"Split was problematic in the sense that it was absolutely garbage in its portrayal of mental illness, but at least it was watchable.
In my opinion, this film is very confused about what it wants to say, and what kind of film it wants to be. The scenes are drawn out for absolutely no reason, an absurd mythologising is going on (the mythologising of what, exactly, is unclear).
Even though James Macavoy's acting should have been plenty, still, we are forced to see him act out this thoroughly unnecessary Hulk-ish persona (and ENDLESSLY switch personalities all the time. OK, we get it, SPLIT, etc, but give us a break...)
By the way, what exactly IS Samuel L. Jackson's character doing aside from being this haughty evil person? +Side of Bruce Willis playing Bruce Willis. Oh, and Anya Taylor Joy (who was rather good in Split) has magical, ""babe, please stop fighting, it's not worth it"" girlfriend energy throughout. Last but not least, Sarah Paulson the insufferable lawful evil psychiatrist archetype that, in all its cartoonish-ness, also manages to really not be interesting at all.
We get it, comic books. But maybe start reading actual books too, and you might end up writing an actual script.",Glass
1264,alexstoyel-44242,Goes from bad to worse to just abysmal...,2,15 June 2019,"This movie is dismal.I liked Unbreakable a lot and Split was pretty good so I was interested to see how this film would bring the different strands together.And the answer is... badly. In short, Glass is much less than the sum of its parts.Everything about the film is so clunky.The premise of the film is just stupid... all three of the characters are in one place and are being persuaded they're not special. This doesn't work because of course the audience knows better... we've watched 2 films... we know they're special so there's no dramatic tension.Then it gets worse. In general a film needs either good characters or a good plot. This film could have both. But somehow, despite two films establishing the characters, all 3 of the main characters feel flat and shallow and they're far less interesting than in the previous films.But maybe there's an amazing plot to save the day...?Nope. The plot is painfully predictable throughout, but it's made worse by a terrible script. Where Unbreakable was a smart, innovative take on the superhero genre, this tries so achingly hard to be clever and cool and 'meta' ... and boy it misses by a mile! You can see every ""twist"" coming a mile off but just in case you can't Samuel L Jackson's character is on hand to tell you exactly what's about to happen. It's not clever or impressive, it's just annoying.So you sit through everything hoping that maybe there will be some pay-off.Ah, sorry. The ""climactic"" fight scene is a huge let down. In fact it's so bad and so low-budget it looks like a high school drama project. There is no tension and the choreography is frankly pathetic.Just as you think it can't get any worse... there is the revelation that Kevin's dad died in the same train crash we saw in Unbreakable... and it's just excruciating. Not only is that some really basic Deus Ex Machina nonsense but it's just chucked in, and just like that the Horde change allegiances... Ta-daa!But we're not done. David Dunn - the indestructible man - gets drowned in an inch of puddle water. Sigh.Then ""love"" saves the day because Casey comes and touches Kevin... and ... urgh.And so, as you start to think of all the things you could've done with your life rather than watch this trash you get The Twist... oh, the psychologist was part of a huge conspiracy. Ah snap, Double Twist... Mr Glass knew that and outsmarted them.You can probably see at least one of those twists coming if you cared, but the truth is by this point you honestly just don't any more. Everything about the film has been so feeble and disappointing that there's no thrill, no tension... nothing. You came in caring about the 3 characters, and now you just don't.Honestly, the only reason this gets 2 starts (and not 1) is because it's not quite as bad as The Happening.",Glass

His character was merely deployable in Split but this movie gave him more depth with a greater sense of history and background.

1269,Ciaran_Clarke99,Glass Review,8,26 January 2019,"Glass is a great squeal to unbreakable and split, that plays on the ideas presented in the previous two movies. This movie is very dialogue heavy but that never takes away from the interesting plot. The movie expands on the characters we already know from split and unbreakable without ruining any development that happened in those two movies. The whole first half of the movie is about dissecting and changing your views of the first two movies, this is the most interesting part of the movie as it gets you to think that how the beast can bend metal and take two shotgun shots was just a coincidence and that the three main characters just have a mental disease. The twist ending feels a little shoehorned into the end and doesn't explain it too much, though this does not take away from any of the films other events. The performances by all the main characters are incredible especially James McAvoy who does a brilliant job changing between personalities. The cinematography is also great with some really inventive shot composition.In conclusion I would recommend Glass to anyone who has seen unbreakable and split as it is an enjoyable watch if you know the entire story.",Glass
1270,ffplay,Nothing to see in cinema,6,31 January 2019,"I thought it will be a great movie, with a spectacular theme - are there any superheros or not...
After watching the movie I have to say that there ist James McAvoy. He plays like he plays in ""Split"" - absolutly fantastic. Watching him with his 24 personalitys is amazing. It rescues the movie.
And I have to say that the theme has potential but it is not used.
So I hope there will be no continue. I won't watch it.",Glass
1271,aidanbacon,Not disappointed,7,19 January 2019,James Mcavoy and Samuel l Jackson give amazing performances and Bruce Willis does a good job too. All the side characters feel like they were necessary for the story and don't feel underused but one has a relationship with one other character that feels a bit strange. The pace is good too and there is quite a few action scenes that were all good. The conclusion is going to split a lot of people making the conclusion make or break it for people . I really liked the ending but I can see why a lot of people don't like it. I think it's a bold direction and it shows m night what's to show his interpretation of the story and not really what the fans want. Overall I really liked glass and hope like unbreakable over time people will start to appreciate it more.,Glass

I've been waiting for the world to see that we exist - Mr. Glass. Written by M. Night Shyamalan, January 18th 2019.Just like Shyamalan said, Glass is the movie which is standing by its own. Not by David Dunn nor Kevin Wendell Crumb. The story is about what do you believe. Superhero is real? Or it's just our assumption that you might believe superhero is real. No one knows.There was a 3rd party (some secret bureau operated by Dr. Staple) which they tried to maketh everything rational accordingly. Therefore they provided every substances to deny any phenomena occurred. What intrigued me more is how Shyamalan revealed each character by bring it up the pass (Unbreakable). A son who believes his father is a superhero, a victim assumes there's kindness in the heart of psychopath and a mother knows his son is capable of everything.M. Night Shyamalan is real original filmmaker. The idea of comic book believing is fascinated. He had the ending on his mind way back when he made Unbreakable.

1283,nikolataylor,Nostalgic,10,6 April 2019,"Year 2000, Unbreakable is released, becomes one of those cult classic. Just when you've giving up hope for a sequel; 16 years to be more precise; ""Split"" comes out spraking a one lit flame. So much potential and ""what if"" starts to rummage into people's mind. The feeling of seeing Bruce Willis once again as ""David"" the hero and Samuel L Jackson as ""Elijah"" or ""Mr. Glass"" bring the best of nostalgia. Lets of course not forget to mention James Mcavoy who plays beautifully a whole village of character as well as ""Mr Beast"" as the main antagonist. I believe they purposely and carefully brought in Mr beast in ""Split"" as a way to bring forth the ""unbreakable"" story to an end in 2019 ""Glass"". Glass ties all knots and ""What if"" to an end, answering all questions end one chapter and if not even a trilogy but also leaving many door opens to more possibilities. Glass is one of those rare movies that actually satisfies your thirst, not leaving you mad or upset but glad to have a great ending. I don't understand why the rating is only around 6.9 out of 10 and I don't care beacause they got it wrong. This movies was made for those who love the ""cult"" classics and sadly I believe that we are in an era where people don't appreciate them anymore. If they made this movies 10 years ago when xmen, marvel, and DC comics where at their beginning and just striving, maybe M Night Shyamalan would had stood a better chance. Instead people have been bombarded with ""mediocre"" super hero movies that ""Glass"" didn't get the attention or the spot light that it deserved! Yet I am still glad they put the effort and time into making one of if not THE most thirst quenching movie. If this movies does get the attention it deserves it could clash against some of the greats such as Star wars, and Lord of the rings.

1286,BlazeIt2G,A disappointing conclusion,6,1 June 2019,"The movie started off quite well, but then fell apart.Visuals: Good cinematography, lighting, aesthetics, etc. Some of the effects looked a bit off (like when The Beast threw the table), but overall the movie looked very good.Music: Just decent. I like the new themes, some themes from the other 2 movies were reused quite effectively, but the Unbreakable Theme (my personnal favorite) was barely used and even remixed.Performances: McAvoy and Jackson were excellent. Anya, Spencer were good. Willis tried but it seemed he didn't know how to do action anymore, which ruined the fight scenes. Sarah Paulson didn't work for me, and the side actors/ actresses (the pranksters, cheerleaders, caretakers) were just terrible.Story: By far my biggest problem with the movie. Act 1 and act 2 was ok (although act 2 was a bit choppy, the scenes didn't ""flow"" very well imo) but act 3 was just a mess in general. The fight scene was terrible since Willis can barely move; the twist, while pretty cool, created plot holes i just couldn't overlook (like if she knew they were superhumans all along then what's with the loose security?, or why couldn't Dunn resist being drowned in a shallow puddle after busting a water tank while being strangled by the Beast? how did he lose all his strength all of a sudden?). Also, many of the dialouges were bad, unnecessary or even cringy (Salt Bae, or when Mr. Glass was brought in Dunn suddenly went like ""OMG this guy's a mass murderer!""). The movie did wrapped up ok though i'll give it that.Overall i felt that Glass was very flawed. M Night had a lot of interesting ideas but executed them poorly. Still, respect to him for being ballsy. Hope he puts out better works in the future.",Glass

1306,djmattm2002-913-491227,"It has its moments, and I could enjoy it for what it was. But it could have been better.",7,21 July 2020,"This will contain SPOILERS as my review is more of a discussion on what I enjoyed about the film and what could have been better. And that being said, it is written on the general assumption the reader has already seen this at least once.The good:
The acting in this was great, but James McAvoy was incredible. Subjectively, his performance(s) in Glass compared to Split felt even much more convincing, with the speech and mannerisms more ""polished"" so to speak. For example, there were a few scenes where it was easier to guess whether Patricia, Dennis, Hedwig or Kevin was 'in the light'. Even before any dialogue was spoken and while wearing the same clothes.Regarding the story, I did like how they portrayed Elijah Price as the classic 'mastermind', and for this reason the film was titled ""Glass"" to focus on his cunning and intelligence in manipulating the character and events. When I watched it the first time, I was taken by surprise when he puts his plan into motion. Up until that point, the rather slow pacing and Elijah appearing completely sedated, lulled me into a state where I couldn't predict when or how he'd make his move. -- When he does, things get a bit more interesting. The 'ticking' theme soundtrack for Elijah's scenes being one of them. -- I'll wrap this up by saying I liked the action/fights scenes. Not everyone did, and I'll note on this at the end of the review.The ""bad"", or disappointing / what I feel could have been better:
Quite simply, I agree with the critics on how David Dunn's screen time was limited, his very disappointing (SPOILER) death scene, and his theme soundtracks from Unbreakable missing from this. His death and how it didn't seem to count for anything, is so much of a disappointment, that makes any other nitpicks fairly petty by comparison.-- I'm going to offer my 0.02 on two things I would have changed about the ending...under the premise that all 3 characters were always intended meant to die. -- Firstly, David should have died a hero protecting his son. Maybe revealing him having drowned during the water tank fight, before it drained completely. I still would have had a twist with the SWAT disguised kill team 'confirming' the kills after Staple leading Joseph, Casey and Elijah's mother away to 'help them cope'. -- And secondly, after the streamed footage goes public, (which also shows Staple's involvement), I would have had a scene showing Staple at a secret meeting, where a dozen FBI agents enter. Nothing too dramatic, just something that lets the audience know that David's death was caught on camera and Staple's people didn't get away with it.Finally, a note on the action/fight scenes that a few critics thought were 'underwhelming', in comparison to Marvel or DC movies. This was, in a way, kind of the point. To make a 'superhero' movie as believable as possible. Elijah mentions this in Glass when he says ""We we can do has a basis in science, but it has limits, this isn't a cartoon."" This notion wasn't any different in Unbreakable, which the same critics also didn't like back then either. It's understandable that many comic book and cinematic universe fans prefer (and expect) such movies to be the opposite of reality, ""Fantasy"". Where the movie is supposed to give them an escape from reality, rather than reminded them of it. Nothing wrong with that preference. But also nothing wrong with preferring a movie that feels much more compelling *because* of how realistic the story, setting, characters. -- And that's what I appreciated about these movies. If David Dunn and the Beast were throwing cars, jumping around rooftops, and that sort of thing; it would have been cheesy. And if they could do all of 'that', then Dr Ellie Staple wouldn't have been able to do her job of trying to convince them they were ordinary or delusional.Overall, despite the things I didn't like, there was enough dialogue and moments I did like to make me want to rewatch them, and spend time making this review.",Glass

1311,Hoekkie,A Whole New World,9,28 January 2019,"How Glass (2019) brings the stories and characters together from Unbreakable (2000) and Split (2016) is fascinating. The story takes place 15 years after the first movie and 3 weeks after the second. It's a smart plot that stays away from clichés and never becomes extraordinary. The superpowers from David Dunn (Bruce Willis), Mr. Glass (Samuel L. Jackson) and The Beast (James McAvoy) aren't predominantly present. That makes this movie an interesting counterweight to the Marvel and DC movies (which we are overloaded with). Director and writer M. Night Shyamalan created a whole new world with this trilogy and he has given the 'superhero vs. villain theme' a new perspective.Most praise goes out to the acting performance of James McAvoy. His portrayal of numerous characters (about 13) is unrivalled. It was a great pleasure to see him transform into personalities time after time and playing them all convincingly.",Glass

1313,cowboysnmanutd,Fresh take on superhero,6,7 February 2019,"4Great Idea But Okay Movie
I do tend to that a love-hate relationship with director M. Night Shyamalan's movies. I think he is a great visionary with beautiful concepts and ideas, but most of the time the execution of the movie do not work well. And Glass is maybe, just maybe, another example.
First thing I have to say, and it is my favorite thing about this movie is the concept and the twist. I am not talking about the ending because the ending is not the strongest M. Night twist ever, but I am talking about the concept of being superhuman. This happens when Dr. Staple explain why are they in the pink room together is amazing. It's something I've never thought of before. I cannot explain more but that sequence shocked me big time.
The second thing I would like to talk about is characters. This movie is supposed to have three main characters, and four supporting characters. Now, I feel like there is actually one main, two supporting, and the less is fill-in-the gap characters. The only character that I like and strong enough in this movie is James McAvoy's character. In Split he did amazing, but in Glass, he goes beyond that performance. Also, he actually plays the 20+ personality which is insane. I cannot say enough about him. Bruce Willis's David Dunn appears at the first act and makes a promise to be an important character, but then he almost disappears in the second act and shows up again in the last act. Similar to Samuel Jackson's Mr. Glass, he is very underutilized and only shows his mastermind power at the end. The less of the cast are very useless and can be disregard from the film.
The movie is a sequel to both Unbreakable and Split, it should be a joining film for both of them. I feel like M. Night had an intention to do so, but for me, the movie just split into Unbreakable's sequel in the first act, and Split's sequel in the second act. It does not ruin the viewing experience or anything, but I believe if he to really blend into one movie instead of dividing them into first and second act would be better.
Finally, despite my complains about Glass, this is actually enjoyable into extent fresh take on the superhero/comic-book movie. I like it more than Split, however, it has more flaws than Split and Unbreakable. I do have to be honest about the quality of the movie, it is not good. Nevertheless, I recommend people to watch it and they might have different interpretations.",Glass
1314,silversurfer166,"Good Film, Personally I Didn't Like The Twist Ending",8,20 January 2019,"As a big fan of Unbreakable, I was excited to see this film. James MacAvoy is fantastic, Sam Jackson is good as usual, and even Bruce Willis acted good (for him). The first twenty minutes were great, we finally got to see Kevin vs. David. But as soon as they get captured and put into the mental hospital, it gets a little slow. Sam Jackson doesn't even speak until more than an hour in. But this is all part of the story, and the story is good. The ""Showdown"" at the end is great, with David and Kevin fighting using their full powers, and Elijah directing them both from the sidelines.
Ok, now the very end Spoilers!I did not like it. I don't think that the twist was setup at all. The Doctor just runs over, has David touch her so he can see the evil she's done, and turns out she's got orders from the Illuminati to kill both superheroes and supervillians? What? This really came out of nowhere for me, and I don't think I liked it. Maybe after seeing it a second time I could see it being setup, but the first time it left me disappointed and a little confused.

I can honestly say I enjoyed the final message and ending of the film, but it's just another failing in M Night's story telling. This film had a great opening twenty minutes and great closing twenty minutes, and everything in between was unfortunately horribly frustrating - filled with lack of logic/huge jumps in logic, characters without any sense of depth and making illogical choices, events and actions happening purely for convenience, and ""twists"" that come too late to save the film. Which sadly is what I've come to expect from M Night. I had such high hopes for this film, as Split was so brilliant and this crossover sequel had such promise. Truly, just watch the opening and the end, skip 90% of the hospital scenes. It barely moves the plot forward, it's full of mainly heavy handed exposition that is at times painful. Brilliant performances couldn't save this one, just M Night M-Nighting all over himself again sadly.",Glass

The acting was great James McAvoy was crazy good, I can't say enough good things about his acting in this movie. However the story just drug on too long and was very boring with a few exciting things thrown in. I was really hoping this would be a great movie but it just falls short.
I would say if u have nothing better to do and u want to see some good acting then u will probably enjoy this. If u r looking for a movie that u can really get into and one that keeps u on the edge of u'r seat then don't bother.

1355,garyrdriscoll,The movie was wonderful.,10,21 January 2019,"If you liked the movies ""Unbreakable"" and ""split"", you will enjoy this movie. Also seeing ""Unbreakable"" and ""split"" first is a must. The movie studios keep giving us remakes or the same basic story over and over again, but not with these movies. These movies are fresh and original. It's not your typical dime-a-dozen superhero movie, nor a fast pace mindless action film. Glass is clever and completely well done. It takes a necessary time to build the story and characters.",Glass
1356,stainfieldtwins,Utterly terrible,1,21 January 2019,"I love Unbreakable and Split. I even kept my expectations moderate, I had to convince my friends that this film will be good and that the trailers for it are just bad trailers like so many before. But this film blew me away by how it fails to competently produce anything compelling.
The screenplay feels like a first draft. The 2nd act is completely pointless. The moment the characters enter the hospital their arcs never change drastically. The film meddles with ideas for forty or so minutes, in which none of them come full circle. Everything could've been compressed into ten minutes and nothing would've changed. It's clear the hospital was utilized as a way of getting around a low budget, but it's like they didn't even try. You see no other patients in the hospital but the main trio and despite Mr. Glass being a high class terrorist he has zero armed guards on him, and the list of plotholes goes on and on.
David Dunn's arc is completely shattered. Not only do they kill off the wife character (a central character from the first movie who was crucial to the story) but they also only give him the least screen time. He has no motivation other than he must do what is right. It's clear that M. Night had no idea how to progress his character as they all die in the end very abrupty by the most cliche evil corporation plot ever.
So what's the big M. Night twist? Before the trio are all killed, Mr. Glass managed to record it on a Livestream. And the Livestream is posted online for the world to see it and believe in super heroes. What a ridiculous ending, people will watch the video and assume it's just cgi or something. Even better, I've seen videos titled ""man bends steel"" and clickbait bullcrap like that already on the internet. How is posting a video going to change anything? It's frustrating how lazy this was and I don't know why everyone is supporting it.
I did like the acting, everyone does what they can with the awful screenplay, and theirs some cool shots, but most of the cinematography is shockingly lazy. The go pro fight scenes are embarrassing and just because it's not quick cut doesn't make it a masterpiece. They're anti climatic, the close ups could be cool but are way too overused, and there's no energy to any of it. The camera is too still and flat looking for the fight scenes, making it feel not as chaotic as it should be. The fights should be hand held, steady and not too shaky, and they should be wideshots and not close ups of the characters faces.
The pacing for the first half is really choppy as well. Scenes start in the middle and they never really begin or end. It's an odd thing to view, but whoever cut the film needs to linger on shots longer.
Anyway that's Glass. Please watch unbreakable and split instead. This one is a genuine nightmare, as bad as M. Nights other failures.",Glass

Slow doesn't mean bad, I liked Tarantino's Hateful 8 which was based around some heavy dialogue, most of The Revenant was DiCaprio crawling through the snow, still enjoyable.The asylum seemed like what should have been a smaller part of the film, it was the heaviest and I personally didn't find it good enough for most of the plot development.The fight scene at the end was quite good, I felt the twist was based around how the real world would see that footage. It wasn't quite spectacular as you'd expected, more real world style, in the real world it would be perceived with heavy skepticism of being fake.Mcovay was a joy to watch, and probably the best part of the film, apart from the way Glass fell, we found that hysterical, SLJ will always be SLJ.",Glass

Release Date: January 18th, 2019 (US)
Runtime: 2hrs 9minsPros:
Solid first act -
Shyamalan's directing -
Excellent performances from Willis, McAvoy & Jackson -
Kevin's expanded multi-personality presentation
Suspenseful action
Sleek choreography
West Dylan Thordson's slowburn musicCons:
Jumbled final act -
David Dunn's minor appearance in the last hour -
Twist lacks surprise -
Annt-climatic final battle -Short Thoughts:
A someone who's not been favourable the Shyamalan over the past years, his latest work, Glass, did not leave me in baffling disappointment like Split, although I wasn't really anticipating this movie much. It honestly has a highly solid first hour with great directing, acting and action, but as the film progresses to the second and last hour, the storytelling loses it's balance and chance of giving a certain character more depth. But overall, not as bad as expect but nowhere to be named an ultimate redemption for the director.TVChannels98 Rating: 6/10",Glass
1360,bigdogwalden,Goof,9,12 May 2019,Loved the movie. Liked the flashbacks to tie in the other movies. The directors trade mark twist I didn't expect made me think. Wish the girls hadn't been laughing in the back of the van when they were fighting against it. Really stopped the flow for me. Don't know how it was missed. Easy edit.,Glass

1362,chewyrossco,I did not want this movie to end!!!,10,10 February 2019,This was the perfect end to a 20 year trilogy. The cast was fantastic and McAvoy was truly phenomenal and deserves all the awards for this performance.. The story was fantastic a steady pace that builds to the final act. The twists and turns were typical of the series and do not disappoint. Don't go expecting Avengers tour superhero's... Its not that type of movie.. And the critics have got this wrong.. It was sublime and this all the series together. GO WATCH THIS MOVIE AND MAKE UP YOUR OWN MIND.. you won't be disappointed,Glass
1363,BlazingBolt,Don't listen to critics. See it now.,9,21 January 2019,"M. Night Shyamalan Does a fantastic job joining split and unbreakable and then tying up the movies. The ending sucks because it had to be that way. Since the ip's are owned by 2 separate studios, it is a miracle this movie was made. There was no way it could go on.Act 1 does a great job bringing the characters together. We also get some character development.Act 2 puts the plot in motion and shows Mr. Glass has a master plan to show the world who they are.Act 3 brings the story to its end. It also ties up loose ends from both unbreakable and split.
Spoiler alert..
The way David dies is my only real issue with the ending. I wish his death could have been more heroic.Over all not quite as good as unbreakable but every bit as good as split. A glorious end to the series.See those 2 movies and then see glass.
It's what real life would be like if people like those existed. Maybe they do and it's covered up like in the movie!",Glass

1368,yehiasalam,Very disappointing end to the triology,6,19 January 2019,"Well I always found Unbreakable and Split to be great movies, great story, great take on the superhero/villains type of of movies. However Glass does not really add anything to Wills/McAvoy main characters.30% of the movie is relying on flash backs and stories from the the previous two movies, 30% introducing new characters that sometimes feel forced to the story, and 30% preparing for the climax, that turns up to be a disappointment in the end.Night Shyamalan could have much better for a conclusion for this trilogy. Also some of the cast, like Sarah Paulson character seemed too stiff, bringing no emotions to her scenes. Bruce Willis practically didn't act, most of the acting is staring at the camera or looking surprised. Same goes for L.Jackson. Only McAvoy got to do his multi-personality show.",Glass

With the climax of Splits ending this really brought about an excitement to see Glass. Boy Oh Boy was my wife and I completely blow away by a smart intense and action packed movie that it belw our minds. James Macavoy is absolutely brilliant.

His role is a difficult one to play, and he did it brilliantly. The plot of this film was amazing as well. It wasn't as action and thrill driven as Split, but it stood out for other reasons.

James McAvoy is absolutely brilliant in the film, his portrayal of a man with multiple personalities is riveting to watch. I like the way that these movies portray the art and cultural significance of comics. All too often comics are dismissed as a genre strictly for children and seemingly devoid of originality. The world really is a place of villains and heroes, even if they aren't wearing capes or masks.",Glass
1375,pranavvmohan,A Brilliant Film that is deep on so many levels,9,21 January 2019,When I read the critics reviews of glass I was genuinely scared.But ultimately it turned out to be something of epic proportions which far outweighed its problems and inaccuracies.This film is something rare and is able to combine X-Men's discrimination/hatred with Batman's gritty realism to form something wholly unique.To people who say the ending is crap I say that you don't understands it's implications as it is a very realistic look at apotheosis and the hatred exhibited by people against extraordinary individuals.One of the only problems with this was Mr Jackson's performance during the film's climax which I admit is pretty stupid.Otherwise this is a Kubrick style masterpiece which will only be appreciated 20 years down the line.,Glass

1381,turleyliamanders,"All risks are taken, and the final result is a beautiful closure",9,18 January 2019,"The ideas and themes M. Night Shamalan has been developing for years have been restated and perfected, used in a breathtaking conclusion to his out of the ordinary ""superhero"" trilogy.All of the risks are taken in this film, and it will surely have polarizing reactions. This is what I love about M. Night Shamalan-he has a lot of unique and spectacular ideas different from any other movies coming out today. Even fantastic movies that are released today cannot surpass the amount of originality and thought he puts into his films. That being said, not all of his films are great. He doesn't always have the right way to present his ideas, but when he does, it is astounding.Like I said, it surely will have polarizing reactions. In fact, this movie already has. But, if you do not like this movie, that is completely justified. I think Unbreakable and Glass are very subjective films, especially this one. The ending of this film doesn't play it safe-in fact, it's the exact opposite. I do not think the critics are wrong, they have a different perspective of this movie. They are not any less insightful than the ones who enjoyed it. Like I said, it's very subjective. You will either be disappointed
or praise this ending. At first, I was disappointed. Shocked, really. But as things began to unfold, and the final thought and idea this movie and its predecessors have been teasing is slowly shown and revealed, I think it couldn't have ended better. I am astounded by the thought and care that was put into this trilogy. It's completely ingenious. The ending is incredible touching and poignant.I failed to mention the acting, production, score, plot, etc. ;) However, these things don't really leave the biggest impact on me. All of them worked great-although I could mention I didn't feel much resemblance this movie had towards unbreakable, excluding the themes and notions of course. But David Dunn didn't really feel like David Dunn. However, I realize it was made almost twenty years afterwards. It's not going to be the same.It's not a perfect movie, but the resolution it has is so developed and so well executed it almost overshadows any other poor aspect.Unbreakable and Split are two of my favorite movies of all time. This movie was not the ending I was expecting. But I am very, very pleased with it. The ending hurts, but it is perfect.",Glass

That's when you remember that old jungle-themed puzzle that you never actually finished.
Sure, the pieces are of a different size, and the colors palettes are nothing alike, but your mind is set on completing the first puzzle.
So, after some cutting and gluing, there it is! Maybe odd-looking, but that's what you wanted, right?
Just one final touch: you put the creature in a golden, gothic frame.Nothing that I just described was necessary, or made any sense, just like this movie. And, just like this movie, it kinda sticks together because you're somewhat familiar with all of the pieces.. but it's a gory view.The acting of James McAvoy is the only thing that made watching this bearable, and will also be the only thing that'll be remembered from this unfortunate experience.",Glass

1395,manchukaman,A great satisfying ending to a beloved trilogy,10,18 January 2019,"This movie was a risk to begin with, being so long since the original came out and shyamalan's track record through the mid to late 00's. To add to the given risk of a possibly niche audience, Shyamalan takes many bold risks with this film, especially in the third act. When there are choices made that he has done in this movie, you risk losing some of your audience to confusion, which I think is the problem for most people. Knowing Shyamalan, he is not one that likes to play it safe, and truly believes that making movies unpredictable and original is an art. Which i feel, whether you like him or not, and whether it does or doesn't always work, is very respectable in a film maker. All these things being said. I really enjoyed this movie, and I do believe that is the natural continuation of the first two movies (Both of which are in my top 10 of all time). It gives us everything the trailer promised and more, especially in terms of depth and story. I believe that this world Shyamalan has created has been well built and set up for this final chapter, and I disagree with a large population claiming the ending wasn't earned. Now to individual points: One that is maybe the only agreed upon positive of the film are the performances. James Mcavoy is a stand out in this one as most would agree, and his work in switching between personalities is maybe the closest thing to flawless in modern cinema. Samuel Jackson is also great, showcasing his ability to tell a story without saying a word. And when he does begin to speak his performance is believable. Even Bruce Willis, who's acting hasn't necessarily been praised in recent years, brings his A-game as well, playing the reluctant hero we all loved in Unbreakable. Sarah Paulson, an actress who I am not very familiar with, impressed me in this film as well. Another positive I have is the action. There is not a lot, given this isn't a run of the mill superhero flick, but when there is, I believe it delivers. The fight scenes are very raw and maybe even a bit crude, but that is what is so good about them. They are displays of strength more than anything, and really maintain the grounded feel of the movies. I also loved the story, which can't be delved in to without spoiling too much. To make this a fair review I must say some things that I wasn't particularly fond of in the movie. One is that Casey and Ms. prIce feel underused and almost unimportant. It was nice to see them reprise their roles, but it wasn't necessary. Another was a few moments of over explaining things to the audience, which surprisingly I found most annoying from Ms. price and Joseph, not the comic book expert Mr. Glass. Do not take these criticisms the wrong way however, as they are small details and overall don't take away from the experience when watching the film.

This movie doesn't match any of these requirements. The built up for the endscene is to long and the character with the 24 personalities keeps repeating the same ridiculous behavior so much it becomes boring and people where actually laughing during his award deserving role.

1405,crazyme-18755,Yes I agree...great!!,9,10 February 2019,"Saw the original first installment,missed split...but I knew enough to see Glass and really enjoyed this film!!Funny I did see that other reviewers did not mention couple of cool things.The Beast never really had the strength to harm David until he got lucky and threw him into the water tub,even then David could hold The Beast at bay and shatter that thick plastic tank/wall with his free hand.Also very cool The Beast attempted a ""Bear hug"" on David that would crush a normal person...David basically ignored this tactic and ""carried"" The Beast on his back...forcing The Beast to go out that (3rd story??) window ,where they both just stood up!!Not sure why it took David several good tries to get thru his steel cell door but I understand he does not have Superman strength...maybe Captain America (lift 800 lbs??) strength??It was also never ""confirmed"" how invulnerable David was...he survived a REAL train wreck that killed all other passengers but you mean they never tried to draw blood at that Psyc hospital??He never was shown to be bullet proof but sharp glass was nothing to him,he never got the famous movie ""mouth bleed"" from fighting either.The way he ""died"" at the end is WRONG,no way two guys could hold him down in that ""pot-hole"" of about 8 inches of water,he could just get up and whip them!!Mr Glass was impressive too...great mastermind!!Casey,very pretty young woman!James Macavoy was ""award winning"" in his performance,just awesome!",Glass
1406,rexytherexdude,Is Glass a good film or not?,8,26 February 2019,"M. Night Shyamalan's 2019 film ""Glass"" is a concept from the beginning ever since his 2000 film ""Unbreakable"", which he wanted David Dunn (played by Bruce Willis), Elijah Price (played by Samuel L. Jackson, and Kevin Crumb (played by James McAvoy). This film also includes returning characters Joseph Dunn (played by Spencer Treat Clark), Casey Cooke (played by Anya Taylor-Joy), and Elijah's mother (played by Charlayne Woodard), and as sequels are bound to have, there are new characters as well, though the character who is most essential to the story is Dr. Ellie Staple (played by Sarah Paulson). Following the events of Split (2017) and Unbreakable (2000), David Dunn is now a vigilante who goes after those who are guilty of crime, leading him to the whereabouts of The Horde. After a brief confrontation between the two, they're taken to a mental hospital, where they meet Dr. Staple. Dr. Staple attempts to make David, the Horde, and the returning Mr. Glass believe that the three are not supernaturally gifted, and rather just believe it after having dealt with past trauma of some kind. Though, Mr. Glass knows that this is not the truth, and has intentions of revealing his abilities to the world, along with the abilities of David and the Horde by teaming up with the Horde to blow up the new Osaka tower in Philadelphia, to which David could go and intervene. This is not how it actually happens however, as it is revealed at the end of the film that Mr. Glass used the surveillance footage from the mental hospital to reveal themselves to the world. While watching the film, I did notice a bit of a pacing problem. In the beginning, the film felt slow, then during the middle, it felt fast paced, then back to slow paced near and during the ending. Another criticism I have about the film is that the idea of Unbreakable (2000) and Split (2017) coming together could have been executed better. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed the film, but the idea could have still been executed better. Overall, I give the film a 8/10.",Glass
1407,darktrick,I reserve the right to change my rating of this...,4,15 April 2019,"To be fair to the movie, my rating came immediately after waking up in the middle of it, because it is so mundane and plodding that it will easily put a viewer to sleep unless properly prepared. Hopefully, when I watch it with a full caffeine load, I can stay awake long enough to reach the parts of the movie that are supposedly phenomenal. Hopefully.",Glass

I was so looking forward to see ""Glass"" because of ""Split"" and the cast seemed to promise that I'd be a good movie. The result was disappointing, boring and a total mess. It seems like the Regisseur changed his mind like thousands of times during the recording of the movie. I think he couldn't decide for one topic and now it's a mix of a bad marvel-thriller-Action-horror-movie. In my opinion spongebob square pants has more of a message and story line than this movie.

Unbreakable was a fantastic movie with its original story, awesome acting and the idea of humans with special gifts. Then split came along and blew my mind, with not only the fact that it's a sequel to unbreakable but because of the acting and how using 23 personality's can give someone so much to love, hands down one of the best performances for sure to James McCoy. Then glass shows up, I expected fight scenes and figuring out what mr. Glass ( Samuel L Jackson) was gonna do next, maybe reveal some new humans with powers and then what I originally thought was gonna go down was nothing of the sort. You have more development of character, you have twists and turns the more the movie goes on and the fact that the director M night could go so much more into this universe if he so chooses, with different locations and different powers with new humans. It was a very well done superhero movie with out the normal superhero story! Will be looking and waiting for the next chapter ( if we ever get one!)",Glass

Bruce Willis is also into he's character, and as for Samuel L. Jackson, well I don't think I can say anything bad about him because he's amazing, these three is amazing. This film is about believing and that's what Mr. Glass wanted every person to see. He just wanted freedom to him and to people like him. The Beast and The Horde is only concern with Kevin that's why they emerged to protect him. And as for Dunn, I only see him as protecting and loving his son. The ending is very beautiful, they got to expose the three and to just believe that they are people like them and they shouldn't hide.",Glass

If you are one of whom who hasn't seen Split then for god's sake stay away from this cluster of a mess! Unbreakable is good by itself actually great, Split is even decent by itself! This isn't either good as an ending or by itself! I understand why Samuel Jackson stayed quiet for the first hour and a half in the film and it wasn't because of the script, he was just fed up on how they were gonna murder this story.. i give it 4/10 because James McAvoy is exquisit and because at some point it gave me some nostalgic feelings from Unbreakable. Other than that its trash..",Glass

I can go on and explain how great this movie is and why but when someone doesn't have the capacity to understand why it's great you can't do anything.If you appreciate good movies you need to watch this movie.

1423,ctrilling,Worth the 20 year wait,7,19 January 2019,"I felt compelled to write a review due to the unfavorable critic reviews. First things first, Unbreakable is one of my favorite fims. When I found out Shyamalan was making a sequel, i slapped my face. I honestly didnt want to see it since it would probably ruin the experience of the first (still never saw dumb and dumber too). Shyamalan has made one good, not great film in a decade (split). Bruce Willis's acting has been down right embarrassing in recent years. Notably taking films just for a paycheck. Glass seemed like a trainwreck waiting to happen (pun very much intended).I got to see the movie for free. I went in with the lowest expectations. I hadnt seen any trailers, bc i was that scared of how the movie would turn out. I'm absolutely shocked. Not only is it a true return to form for shyamalan in terms of direction, but its brilliantly written and paced. The score is beautiful. The acting mezmerizing for all its leads including the always solid Paulson. It stays true to both of its first films while carefully doing a balancing act as a sequel to both.I was 13 when unbreakable came out. I didnt know anything about it going in. Id only seen the poster. It blew me away. Its always been one of my favorite films. I wrote this review to personally thank Shyamalan. Please know you have fans out there who really love and grew up with ypur films. Thank you for putting your full effort into this. It shows on screen.Now please do not take this as permission to make a 6th sense sequel.",Glass

1438,sahil_herck,"""This is not a Cartoon. This is the real world""",10,21 January 2019,"How many times did M.Night Shyamalan showed Elijah aka Mr. Glass saying this particular line on his trailers of the movie. And yet the critics and people bashing this movie did not understand this and wanted a happy ending where the superhero beats the supervillains and they all live happily ever after!Ok so this is the first time I am writing a review and it's going to be totally honest and unbiased review:-First of all I completely fail to understand why the critics and so many people here gave it 1 star and hated it. After thinking about it and speaking to some people who did not like it I have come to these conclusions that these people:
A. Have never watched unbreakable or split - just saw the cast and went for the movie - found it slow - hated it
B. We're expecting an action movie with a happy ending - found it slow with more talking and less action - hated it
C. Did not want to use their brains or waste time thinking about the movie. Just wanted a popcorn flick with feel good factor - found it to be thought provoking- hated it
I mean this was a superhero movie grounded with reality. And in the real world the hero does not always have to win. But noo we only want movies like avengers where the heroes always win. Even after infinity war everyone knows in part 2 the heroes will win so when M. Night Shyamalan made a superhero movie which was different and out of the box, people started losing their mind.
The whole plot- the main motive of Mr Glass was to show the world that they exist and he did it in the end that too with his brilliant and devious plan (earning him the badge of the mastermind).
*Spoiler alert* About David Dunn dying..it's fine sometime the hero doesn't live and as if Bruce Willis will come back to play the role..he is already too old.
And cmon the Beast and Glass had to die. They had killed so many innocent people. So why are people getting angry that they all died. They fulfilled their motives and world got to know about them.And finally about the twist that people didnt like *spoiler alert* - the secret organisation killing people with powers. It all makes sense doesn't it- its because of them the world didnt not know yet about superheroes..it's because this organisation has been killing them. It's not like this universe has a superman who is an alien and one of a kind. This universe had normal human beings who were broken and got evolved. So definitely David, Kevin, and Elijah weren't the first or the last..there were and are more of them but this organisation has been killing them so noone knew about them untill...Mr. Glass arrived and revealed the truth with his plan - The mastermind and that why the movie is named after him! It's his origin story! People just have to think a little while watching this movie and it will all make sense.People need to watch this movie with an open mind and with no expectations.

I don't like watching all powerfull, god-like superheroes and villains again and again getting stronger and stronger. I was expecting so much from Glass and maybe that's why it is a colossal disappointment for me. Of course I was not expecting to end in a epic fight in front of the world like all the other superhero movies but you just can't kill characters that you have been investing for 3 movies by some unknown foe, which has no connection to anything or anyone in the trilogy. An all secret, all mighty organization pops up and kills all the main characters. That is not a big twist that is a really lousy scenario writing. How would it be if suddenly a secret cult emerges at the end of the final Star Wars movie and kills Luke, Vader and Emperor? Even in Avengers they have been building up Thanos for some time.

The acting in this film is top notch. But you should expect that with two legends like Bruce Willis and Mr. Samuel L. Jackson. Then you add in Golden Globe winner Sarah Paulson and one of the most amazing minds in film James McAvoy. James jumps between 20 different personalities and does it flawlessly.
The direction of the film was well done as well. It had a dark gritty look. Which screamed M. Night. And it wouldn't be a M. Night film without a twist which I enjoyed as well.

The script is just plain stupid and really only hugely diminishes the brilliance of Unbreakable.

No chemistry between than at all.Apparently James McAvoy's character was cut from the original 'Unbreakable' film, if his character had been able to stay maybe this whole trilogy would make sense.Also apparently this movie takes place 3 weeks after 'Split'. When was that piece of information given to the audience?When did Sarah Paulson get so typecast as a baddie who is so stiff that she gives a completely unremarkable performance?This movie did not deliver on

1472,varnita06,EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING,4,5 April 2020,"*** SPOILER ALERT ****
I was so excited for this one after seeing the last two parts of the trilogy. Bruce Willis's (Unbreakable) character was not given due time on the screen and was shallow. We definitely expected more. James McAvoy stole the show clearly. Only his character was able enough to get our attention. Few things in the movie just seemed baseless and stupid including the 'psychiatrist' realising the conspiracy by Glass in the end which was so obvious. The story made sense in the end but the way it has been executed is PATHETIC. I feel the whole story revolving around the psychiatric hospital was useless. They could have thought better.
The ending was TRAGIC. If killing them was an answer instead of treatment then they could have just shot them right in the first 10 mins of the movie! I think the makers are confused themselves whether they are superheroes or someone with disorders. And of course the frequent use of some mental disorders' symptoms propagates misinformation about them further confusing people and demeaning patients with such mental disorders especially when DID is considered.",Glass

Manoj 'Night' Shyamalan's latest, ""GLASS"" is a reminder to treat phobias, obsessions (OCDs), multiple-identities, negative self-belief and about experiments in outreach of the treated and the treating psychiatrist ('psykyieatrist'!). Brawny youth, a child at heart is dangerous, fragile 'science' man is pain-multiplier and the third, an unbreakable. In a take-over from ""UNBREAKABLE"" wherein Bruce Willis proved steely points and Samuel Jackson, umpteen physical frailties, over the 2 decades; the third 'untreatable', the almost shape-shifting McAvoy does what devoted acting does to theatre/play performances. Eyeie Sarah Paulson, a very patient --alongside, remaining very coolly beautiful-- therapist with resources and innovativeness, doesn't wish to lose her resolve and expertise in the face of toughest of unbearableness from the three, even placing them in one line and exploring solutions to the three, in one procedure. She does lecture at the end to upcoming therapists to 'punish the deranged when they get truly dangerous, treat them with concern, sustaining a balance always', though she couldn't answer the gruesome killing of hospital staff and security personnel, one too many. No exact solutions given to chronic hallucinations, delusions stalking the minds imagining 'in light' or in the absence of it, but Comic Book type-casts encouraged from childhood by the near & dear, through Comics Media in overdose and by reckless marketing community of heroishness (and villainy, of course!) nourish the obsessed patients of the Mind, without actual solutions.

1511,rkessleruv-68626,"Starts as a Disappointment, Ends in Disaster",5,18 January 2019,"Here's some context before the review: I am a HUGE M Night Shyamalan fan. I will often defend him and his bizarre choices. To add to that, I am and EVEN BIGGER Unbreakable fan. Unbreakable is one of my favorite movies of all time, and upon rewatch of Split, that film is great too! Unbreakable in particular is a beautiful view of what our world would be like with superheroes. The pacing is slow but works fantastically for the film. Long dialogue-less takes allow the characters to grow and emotions to encapsulate the space. Additionally, the dynamic between Willis and Jackson (and the ultimate reveal at the end) is masterful and natural. This completely changes the film for the better. After seeing Split (and in particular the ending), I was massively excited for Glass. If Glass were great, this could've been one of the greatest cinematic trilogies of all time. Unfortunately, that is definitely not the case.
Glass picks up where we left our characters at the end of Split. Kevin Wendell Crumb is terrorizing a new group of ""pure"" teenage girls while David Dunn (along with his son) have turned to vigilante justice since Unbreakable and have sought to track down Crumb. A promising concept, and ultimately what many people asked for. There are several noticeable detriments since the previous two films, however.
For one, the overall presentation of the film is surprisingly cheap compared to Unbreakable and Split (which is even more surprising considering Split cost $11 million less to make than Glass). The lighting feels over-present, the play with colors (masterfully displayed in Unbreakable) is greatly downplayed, and there are several instances where the budget constraints are on FULL display (oh boy, we will GET TO THAT in the third act). To compare, Unbreakable and Split were able to convey so much more and add to the emotional impact of those films with so many fewer resources (despite Unbreakable's inflated budget). Unbreakable in particular contained beautiful color palettes and greatly valued darkness. Unbreakable was so powerful through its use of dark shadows and gloomy lighting, which completely fit with the tone it was trying to convey. Glass feels like the Hollywood version of Unbreakable (which...oh yes...we will DEFINITELY get to that as well). There are a handful of spectacular shots in the film (many of which are shown in the trailer), but as a whole, the visual presentation is a massive letdown.
Going along with the visual presentation, the score of the film is uninspired. To compare to Unbreakable and Split once again, each of the scores for those films was used to enhance the experience. Unbreakable features one of the most iconic and underrated scores of all time, while Split features a score which works greatly when paired with the visuals (and contains one or two fantastic compositions which rival those of Unbreakable's). Glass does not have one memorable composition in sight. The choice to implement a new score COMPLETELY DIFFERENT to those of Unbreakable and Split was a massive letdown, and when the film does decide to use music from the previous two entries, the inclusion feels unwarranted and forced.
So the overall presentation is sloppy. This is immediately apparent within the first five minutes. But this can be excused with a great story, right? Yes, of course. The problem is that the screenplay of the film begins repetitive and ultimately turns into a bigger disaster than The Last Airbender. No, I'm not exaggerating.
The film is watchable and competent enough for the first 20 minutes, where David Dunn has an entertaining brawl with Kevin Wendell Crumb until they are eventually stopped by police and taken into a facility for ""people who believe they are superheroes"". Kind of an interesting plot point on paper, but the pacing of the film comes to a halt and turns painfully repetitive. Endless scenes feature Ellie Staple, Sarah Paulson's character, trying desperately to convince Dunn, Crumb,Elijah Glass, and the audience that they do not have superpowers. The problem with this concept is that we've seen throughout Unbreakable and Split that Dunn and Crumb have supernatural powers. There is no possible way for the audience to believe Staple's ludicrous claims since we've seen this all first hand. Staple's dismissals of various displays of supernatural tendencies are particularly hilarious, stating that ""the metal bars in the zoo were weak after several years"" and ""you were able to see what Crumb was up to from the clay on his pants"". No, Shyamalan. Sorry, but I'm not taking your bait.
Now I'll cut to talking about the side plots of the film. Seem jarring in this review? Well it's just as jarring in the film itself. For one, David Dunn's son, still played by Spencer Treat Clark (who's acting chops have not aged over the years) is trying to find a way to break his father out of the institution. Eventually there's a hilariously bad scene (featured in every horror movie ever) where the character searches for information on Google. This is where he learns information about Crumb's past, which he will use in the worst possible way in the third act.
Anya Taylor-Joy is also back in the film, but her purpose in the film feels forced and also laughable. Since the first film, Taylor-Joy has grown a bizarre affection for Crumb and is desperate to visit him. On paper, her infatuation with Crumb is understandable, since she was revealed to share a domestic-abuse history with Crumb as a child. However, there's no denying that Crumb emotionally tortured and abused her in Split, so Casey's ultimate ""love"" for Crumb is totally unbelievable. It's as if Shyamalan couldn't find a clear purpose for Casey in the film, but he felt he needed to shoehorn her into the film since IT IS A SEQUEL TO GLASS. Elijah's mother also returns for the film, but she is given very little to do other than what she had already accomplished in Unbreakable.
Now we get back to the central story. It is revealed that Mr. Glass has been planning an elaborate and convoluted scheme with Kevin Crumb to have him fight once again with David Dunn. He misleads the audience by telling Crumb about how he should battle Dunn on top of the conveniently newly established buildings in the city (which are horrendously CGI-d into the backdrop), but Dunn stops Crumb outside of the institution once they all break out. Oh yeah, the process of them breaking out was so dumb and mind bogglingly stupid that I completely zone out. Mr. Glass is REALLY SMART I guess, so this makes him able to do anything the plot wants him to. This was able to buy in Unbreakable, but it's such a huge and outrageous stretch in Glass.
This is where the film rides the line line between satirical genius and complete incompetence. The execution of the fight scene between Dunn and Crumb is so awful and sloppy to the point of becoming an unintentional commentary of the contrived and overtly complex nature of modern-day comic book movie. Once the two are outside, Dunn's son, Casey, and Elijah's mother all show up to the institute at the EXACT SAME TIME as this breakout (unbeknownst to them). Staple even states how this is a coincidence similar to one ""from a comic"", which could be clever, but I interpret this more as Shyamalan rolling over on his belly and acknowledging the idiocy of his convoluted plot. Mr. Glass also narrates the fight, stating how ""all the main characters are here"". Then this fight begins. The fight we've been waiting the whole movie for (for the second time I guess). Remember how I called the movie cheap before? Oh boy. This is a whole new level. The fight choreography is insanely weak and clunky. There are several Go-Pro perspective shots which come across as insanely sloppy. Next, one of the characters points at a GIANT CONTAINER OF WATER and says ""hey look at that, it's a placed thing of water, that's Dunn's weakness!"" What the **** going on? At this point, I was done. I started laughing hysterically in the theater at what I was seeing. I truly believed that this was some genius satire and that M Night had pulled off a new and fantastic ""twist"" with this bait-and-switch middle finger to everyone who wanted a standard comic book movie.
As the film carries on, however, this theory becomes more unbelievable (and even more laughable). Dunn's son stands in the middle of The Beast and Dunn, telling him information about how Mr. Glass was responsible for killing his dad (who was on the same train as Dunn in the first Unbreakable) since the death of his dad resulted in his mom becoming abusive which resulted in his multi-personality disorder. Sound contrived? YEP. I couldn't believe my eyes. How does a screenplay this inept and terrible get approval? This results in Crumb killing Glass. Next, some more police show up, which turn out to be working for the institution, which turn out to be an institution lying to the patients because they don't want superheroes to exist in the world. So they've had powers the whole time...what a twist! One of the cops DROWNS DAVID DUNN IN A PUDDLE. Yep. A puddle. This is when Casey shows up to have a purpose in the movie. She goes over to Kevin and basically expresses her LOVE FOR HIM, which results in him turning back into his Kevin form, where he is shot and killed by the cops. Ugh. Our three main characters are dead in unsatisfying ways. Good job Shyamalan.
Still not quite over. It turns out that Mr. Glass had hacked into every camera into the institution and WANTED to be recorded by the cameras so he could share the information with the world that superheroes exist, allowing superheroes hiding or afraid around the world to come out. How did he do this? Because he's a mastermind I guess. This theme Shyamalan tries to convey about this society trying to cover up this hidden society of people is actually pretty decent. This could have been really interesting in a better executed version of this movie. As it is, this movie left me broke.",Glass

1519,knicolai,Hoping To Save Someone The Time And Money,2,20 May 2019,"A few nights ago I had rented a movie from Redbubble in the hopes of getting some good entertainment. First, let me start off by saying, I've seen both Unbreakable and Split and second, I've seen a lot of really bad movies so I have a tolerance level and can overlook just about anything. This is what made the majority of the film, mediocre to me, while others might have found it quickly not living up to their expectations. The movie's start was interesting enough but the problem came in as soon as David Dunn and Kevin Crumb were caught and taken to a psychiatric ward where they were told they were not superhuman. The problem was, it just wasn't buyable. In both movies we have seen up until this point what all of the characters can do so we know that they are superhuman. On top of this the head lady made a statement to David Dunn's son that the reason David was there was because he had carried out vigilante justice and one of the girls who he saved got hurt and if police had been there she wouldn't have gotten hurt. I was relatively sure that given the circumstances, in real life, this scenario would not be happening. After all, in a situation where one had the ability to save someone else, law enforcement might not be able to get there in time which would require personal intervention. Considering that David Dunn was found fighting Kevin Crumb, it had already gotten to that point and police probably wouldn't have made it in time. In retrospect, it made sense once the film was over so I can't complain too much but given the context, it could have been an indicator that there was something very wrong with the government as in real life it most likely wouldn't happen. In any case, as I have stated, the film pushed the thought that these men weren't supherhuman but it just wasn't buyable and the attempt at making it seem more buyable was a ridiculous attempt at best. The head lady gave several excuses as to why she thought that they weren't superhuman and maybe if it weren't only halfway through the film it would have made me wonder a bit. But I knew I had an hour to go so I knew it wasn't the case. Also, the ridiculous love that Casey had for Kevin is quite unbelievable. It felt so forced that I even paused the movie and said to my husband that it just wasn't realistic. I'm sorry, I'm really supposed to believe that she falls in love with this guy after he kidnaps her, locks her up, and murders I believe all three girls who are with her, subjecting her to multiple personalities that would have her on edge the entire time and she finally had to escape him because her life was on the line? But I gave that a pass because one could argue she had Stockholm syndrome or that she felt connected to him because they both shared a history where they were abused as children or that she just felt he was a troubled man who was pittiable. Whatever the case, to me, it still felt forced but I overlooked it. The rest of the film had a few more things that bugged me like some of the corny scenes with James McAvoy growling and roaring. Don't get me wrong, he's a good actor and was fantastic in Split and Glass but did we really need to spend more time watching him grunt and growl? The ending of the film had me somewhat perplexed though. Mr. Glass takes Kevin out of the building where he has decided to force a fight between him, Kevin, and David. In a twist ending that nobody would have seen coming (yes, I said that sarcastically) the head lady was really working for the government all along and she just was trying to convince them they weren't superhuman because the government didn't want superhumans walking amongst us. David was then drowned in a puddle, Mr. Glass was killed by Kevin and Kevin was shot because Casey loved him and turned him back into Kevin. And then, in order to make the film seem better, they threw in a not quite happy ending of sorts where Mr. Glass set everything up where everyone could see their deaths because it was posted online. So people should come out of hiding and not be scared to live with their powers. As if it we would all just get past what just happened. Listen, I am well aware that sometimes the ending to a trilogy can be a let down but none moreso than this. Split came out in 2016 so we've had three years wanting to see an ending to Unbreakable and Split and it ends with them killing off all three characters for what purpose? So we can be sucked back into watching another movie that has nothing to do with the original characters we like other than the fact that their deaths caused others to come out of hiding? Maybe I would be a little bit more accepting of the movie if I hadn't stayed up until seven in the morning to finish it but just to sum up my feelings, I overlooked all the unbelievable things about the movie, sat through over an hour of boring dialogue and nothing but characters talking at each other, to watch all three characters, two of whom I'd grown quite attached to, die at the end, just to show the world that heroes existed. After all, that couldn't have been accomplished with anything else. It was downright maddening that I spent even four dollars on this movie but at least I didn't go see it in the theater. Than I would have gotten to hear the stupidity in surround sound. In any case if you're the type of person who enjoyed the ending to The Birds you might like it. If you absolutely hated that movie you'll probably hate this as well.",Glass
1520,mamazu,💡,4,6 February 2019,"Every time I'm watching Shyamalan movie I'm wondering: who might really like it? Because there're movies that try to be serious, deep, thought-provoking and succeed in that regard; there're movies that fail in that regard, however they'd still be somewhat entertaining; but there're also movies that fail to be both deep and entertaining, yet they would try really hard to convince you of their (lacking) profoundness. For me almost every Shyamalan movie fits the last category just right. That's why I find character of S.Paulson pretty symbolic: like the director himself, she's also trying to make the protagonists believe in something that is not true.",Glass

1523,tekkitgamer,Crazy movie with a unexpected end,6,21 January 2019,Glas is one of this films where the plot is dragged out and predictable except the show down at the end . Also the performence of each actor/actress is amazing and makes the movie more vivid and interesting. And how I just sayed the end is the one of the best things of the film. This is because the show down release an unexpected end which the viewer surprised. But it is also a very risky end and breaks through the boredom of the earlier plot.,Glass
1524,Banc30,An Acquired Taste,10,23 January 2019,"To understand why the movie ended the way it did, pay close attention to Shyamalan's penning: ""This is not a cartoon. This is the real world"". And in the real world, ladies and gentlemen, people die. Humanity's greed; quite specifically, their envy, will prevent those gifted from ever coming out of hiding. Mankind will find a way of destroying them, just like internet trolls found on this feed, shunning someone's art. Nobody rates success as much as they'd like watching someone fall. Humanity didn't want redundancy, hence killing those gifted without exposure. As soon as Mr Glass' video surfaced online, we see Dr Ellie Staple (Sarah Paulson) scream because their organisation now knows they're fighting a losing battle. Humans, sooner or later, will near extinction in evolution of those on the new spectrum; namely, Dunn's spectrum. The ending, in my humble opinion, is an acquired taste - nevertheless - smart. The war has only just begun. ""This was an origin story the whole time"".",Glass
1525,louisremillard,The critics are insulting,10,19 January 2019,"Walking out of the theater, the only thing I could think of was: What the critics said is an insult to this movie. Glass was way way way above my expectations and I found it even better than Unbreakable (which was a masterpiece). It is the perfect crossover for the two previous films. The movie perfectly combines genres like drama, psychological thriller, horror and superhero. Even though this is a very grounded movie that focuses more on dialogue and suspense, it has more action that I thought it was going to have and I loved it. I don't want to get to much into spoilers but if you've been waiting for the showdown between David Dunn and The Beast ever since you saw Bruce Willis at the end of Split, don't worry: it does happen and it doesn't disappoint. I totally love the way they reintroduce all of the three main characters and specially the way they reintroduced David Dunn. Bruce Willis truly looked invested in reprising this role unlike some of his latest movie where he just looked like he signed the contract without looking what it was just to get it out of the way. James McAvoy delivered an even better performance that what we saw in Split, so much that most people will say that he stoled the show and I can totally understand why you can agree with that opinion, but to me, this was Samuel L. Jackson's movie. His character drives the plot forward and Jackson's solid performance brings more elegance and style to the character. It just makes us feel like Mr. Glass is even more threatening even though his fragility. Mr. Glass might go down as one of the greatest villains in cinema history. I totally recommend Glass as long as you don't go in expecting a Marvel like superhero movie. As a fan of the 177 Eastrail trilogy, I am more than satisfied with what Shyamalan delivers in this movie. It's a 10/10 for me.",Glass

1562,eengner,Doesn't need to exist - SPOILERS,5,18 January 2019,"I'm a huge M. Night fan, although my favorite move is Lady In The Water (for character development), Unbreakable was another highlight movie for me.
Glass, however, terribly disappoints. In fact, i think this movie diminishes the great story line of Unbreakable. One example is that all of a sudden the father of the BEAST was on the same train as David Dunn - ok, that's not a huge problem, so i'll get to the point..... oh wait..... what was the point of GLASS anyway. We see our beloved characters, years later, apparently moving forward with their comic book identities with the addition of the Villain ""Beast"", which ties Dunn and Price to a common thread, and this is great. The story line, however, is .... well ... to just kill all of the characters, and it's not that difficult or exciting. Even the insanely powerful Dunn ""Overseer"" was simply held down, by two police officers, and drowned in a pot hole (ridiculous), while Elijah Price was ""pushed"" out of his wheel chair to his death.Now, apparently, there is a dedicated group of people, led by Dr. Ellie Staple, who plan to locate and kill everyone who presents characteristics of comic book heroes, and their corresponding villain - but their method appears to be to call the police and let them handle the messy part ?!?! That's ""weak tea"".The highlight is James McAvoy as Kevin Wendell Crumb. His presentation of personality transformations is some of the best ever presented. To say that his performance is Simply Amazing is not enough.I rate this movie mostly because the plot is just weak and mostly meaningless. I don't think this movie, in it's current version, even needs to exist. Finally, i'm totally blown away that there are so many 9 and 10 ratings for this movie, when something as complex as ""Signs"" (6.7 IMDb) and as well presented as ""The Village"" (6.5 IMDb) are rated so low.I saw someone said ""we are going to be arguing about this G**d**n movie for years"" and i think that's very true (insert smiley face).To M. Night, I will always be a fan, your early movies are so unique, muti-threaded and exciting that I will always believe in your creative abilities. Bring back the good stuff, not the main-stream stuff ! Long live ""Lady In The Water"".BTM (Age 47)",Glass

I thought this was absolutely superb. Intelligently written, beautifully shot and flawlessly acted by all concerned, I was riveted by this film from start to finish. I honestly can't imagine what anyone could find to detract from the perfection of this piece of work, and in fact I genuinely feel sorry for people who are so dried out they can't be entertained by such a rich story. And what a story! I am happy to say that I didn't see the twists coming. I am sad that this concludes the tale, but nonetheless fulfilled by its conclusion. Particularly deserving of merit, is James McCavoy's incredible delivery of his role; and it was a lovely touch to have Spencer Clark reprise his role from the first film, adding a nice bit of continuity.

And I haven't watched Glass.You start the story right in the middle and expect people to have a knowledge of the background. But no. Audience are lost from the get-go.That, and the storyline is a slow-burner. The pace is so slow laced with copious dialogues. I want to see more from the characters but what I get is extraneous dialogue and Dunn's stoic face.I know this is fiction but there must be some logic
in your universe. The three characters are dangerous, finally captured by the authorities and logically speaking, they are and should be under heavy-surveillance.Why is there only one guard working in a shift? And the guard leaves before the next guard clocks in? I cannot brain this.Glass tells the Split guy he has two minutes before the next guard comes in. His activity outside his cell later shows that he spends more than two minutes.And Glass is also good at programming? Since when? A guy can't simply become a hacker. Besides, he has no access to know-how programming books in his cell.Sorry but I don't feel an iota of sympathy for any of the characters.My last hope when I watched Glass was your signature plot-twist but my hope was ultimately crushed by meteorites from the Shyamalan universe.Since the story has been dull all along, the plot twist becomes so meh.Please dont make another superhero-genre movie again.

1586,TangerineQueen,Actual Trash,2,11 April 2019,"I've decided to give this movie two stars based entirely on two merits.
The first being James McAvoy's performance. He is stellar for every side of Kevin's personality that he plays, and the character deserves to be in a movie better than this.
The second being the scene where David Dunn drowns in a pot hole in the middle of the parking lot. It was easily the hardest I had ever laughed in a movie theatre. The scene had an over-the-top ridiculousness that you do need to see it to believe it, as I had done.

1593,n00bMLG,"Great Potential, Terrible Film",4,24 January 2019,"Seeing the Critic scores for this film was disappointing, but then the audience scores were high and fans liked it, it wouldn't be the first time I disagreed with critics so I went into the film wanting to like it, and now I see that the critics were right. The film is a mess, from the beginning you see that this is a film that thinks it's super profound and smart, even though the writing is far worse than the writing in Unbreakable and Split, the pacing is incredibly slow, Bruce Willis clearly doesn't care about the film and it really shows in his acting. Not to mention the confusing cinematography, some of the shots are pretty good while others are awful and will make you sick. The film starts to pick up in the final act and I found myself much more invested once the titular Mr Glass finally shows up in the third act being absent from the rest of the film. I got pretty excited to see the third act, as the three main characters have a really interesting dynamic with each other, I wasn't expecting the action scenes to be great(they weren't, but they were serviceable) but the third act was mostly satisfying(with one reveal in particular) until the big Shyamalan twist, which has to be one of the worst twists I've ever seen. When the only build up to your twist can be misread as a lack of knowledge of a subject in a movie as messy as this one it doesn't work. It has one of the most unsatisfying endings of any movie I've seen, for the last ten minutes of the movie I was just sitting in the theater dumbfounded as to what just took place. The movie isn't all bad, Samuel L Jackson and James McAvoy were amazing in their respective roles(even though the writing was pretty bad at times) and the final act was mostly enjoyable. For some people maybe it is a satisfying conclusion to the trilogy, but for a film with so much potential to be so disappointing just makes it seem like a waste.

His performance should go down in history as one of the most convincing and yet ridiculous. I have never seen anything like it in my entire life. Looks like the ultimate acting excercise and makes every scene in which he's in absolutely delightful to watch.
But then there's the script. I'm not sure what was going through Night's head when he wrote this one. For a moment you think the plot will twist and everything you thought was bad about it would actually be good. But that moment never comes. It just gets worse. And worse. Yes there is a twist, but it just makes everything even crazier and less believable than it was before.
The female that was the protagonist in Split seems even more devoid of expression than in the previous one. You could argue that her past would justify her being so cold, but she's not even convincing at expressing her coldness. Sarah ""Lisp"" Paulson is a great actress but the character was way too over the top. I could see how it would work if the movie was an actual superhero flick, but it doesn't work in this kind of deconstruction of the genre. Seems to surreal. Bruce did a great job. His character doesn't have the heaviest weight to carry here but at least he is convincing and easy to indentify with. S. Jackson was meh. Not his acting but the actual writing of the character. I don't think they were successful in explaining what made him brilliant. There was too much writer's privilege.
My biggest gripe are the plot holes. So many of them. I'm still giving it a 6 because I think overall it can be enjoyed, the good sort of outweighs the bad, but only because of McAvoy's performance.",Glass

1601,harrypettigrew,Shyamalan has redeemed himself,8,23 January 2019,"Note: I advise you watch Unbreakable and Split before reading any reviews for Glass.Glass is an alternative take on the superhero origin story as David Dunn and Kevin Wendell Crumb start to question their supernatural abilities.
The film is set in the same universe as M. Night Shyamalan previous films Unbreakable and Split. All the main cast from the previous films reprise their characters in this film.The main cast consists of James McAvoy, Bruce Willis, Samuel L Jackson, Sarah Paulson and Anya Taylor-Joy.
It deviates from the traditional superhero genre by focusing on the psychology of its main characters and doesn't rely on big action set pieces to intrigue its audience. The film follows themes established in the first film in the series Unbreakable and only brings in certain aspects that were established in its sequel Split.
If your favourite film in the series so far was Unbreakable you will enjoy Glass because of their shared similarities.
The similarities in both films allows the mystery surrounding the series to finally come to a close. This trilogy started nineteen years ago and is impressive that the series has maintained its level of quality after all this time. You can tell that the director M. Night Shyamalan is passionate about the series as he doesn't normally do sequels to his films. He has also confirmed he will not produce a sequel to Glass so this film is the final entry in the series.
M. Night Shyamalan's has redeemed himself with this latest release after he released the critically panned The Last Airbender and The Happening in the 2000's which tainted his filmography.
The writing in the film is questionable at times as some conversations in the film can come across as unnatural. I believe this is due to issues with the script and isn't caused by the acting featured in the film. James McAvoy's performance in the film is a real showcase of his acting range as he effortlessly interchanges between the twenty-four personalities his character possesses. With the surprise inclusion of Black Panther being nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards this year, it would be outrageous if James McAvoy isn't considered for a best actor nomination.
The run time for the film clocks in at 2hr 9 minutes which is needed to establish the connections for all the characters from the previous two films. This doesn't affect the pace of the film and compliments the film's climax well.
Glass received an age rating of 15 in the United Kingdom, so it is targeting a mature audience and will be inappropriate for younger audiences. This is due to the inclusion of graphic violence and swearing.
The film seems to have been faced with mixed reviews with critics. At the time of writing this, review aggregate site Rotten Tomatoes awarded it 37% while its competitor Metacritic gave it 42 which is lower than the two previous films. This can be subject to change in the following weeks.
Glass is a great film for fans of the franchise but does require you to be familiar with the previous films to enjoy it. It is also one of the first major releases of the year, so I believe it will do extremely well at the box office due to the lack of competition.",Glass

Bruce Willis clearly doesn't care about his acting, really the best part of this film is James McAvoy's acting, which is really good, and a few scenes which I thought were really well shot and good.

1617,PierreClement,I had a good time,8,8 February 2019,"I loved ""Glass"", an effective action film orchestrated by actors of incredible accuracy. The film is certainly not as good as its two predecessors, but let's stop comparing it to two masterpieces! Glass closes this fantastic trilogy perfectly and the references to ""Unbreakable"" and ""Split"" are a delight for the viewer who has seen these two films. The brilliant James McAvoy is simply breathtaking in his personality change exercise, even more so than in ""Split"". On the other hand, Bruce Willis, who I've never really liked, is not particularly noticed. But let's also talk about the super Samuel L. Jackson who makes the film take on another dimension from the moment his character comes to life. We may regret some of the clichés that hide the director's talent, although these impressions of déjà vu do not in any way spoil this superb film The brilliant Mr. Night Shyamalan therefore signs a powerful, beautiful, strong film that takes the gut from beginning to end (the end is very successful). However, even if ""Split"" and ""Unbreakable"" can be separated from each other, it is imperative to have seen them to fully enjoy ""Glass"". A feast therefore, which comes to close a trilogy that has marked me personally and that I will remember. Thank you Night Shyamalan!",Glass
1618,pranavgupta-56553,"Review of Unbreakable, Split, and Glass",4,14 May 2019,"The Review of Unbreakable, Split, and Glass:I thought that these movies in their own right were fantastic. They showed the origin stories of three various actors and how they come into their own through traumatic experiences in there life. It is said that those who are able to grow past traumatic experiences and thrive are able to accomplish the greatest feats in life and that can definitely be said for Bruce Willis, Samuel L Jackson, and James McAvoy. Unbreakable sets the stage with the story of Bruce Willis as a man who has encountered many dangerous life threatening situations in his life, but has always lived to tell the tale. Samuel L Jackson on the other hand was born with a disease where his body breaks extremely easy. As the story goes they are polar opposites. Both sides are shown ins this movie and we learn of the evil that is inherently present within Samuel L Jackson. Moving forward to Split we follow a man who due to childhood abuse creates multiple personalities to cope with life. Each personality though is very different, some being hostile and some being safe. Throughout the movie we learn about how he goes through changes and as the audience we can clearly see some good in him despite the vicious evil. In the final installment of M Night Shyamalans Glass, we are now watching all three characters who have found themselves in a psychiatric ward due to their various conditions and situations. An epic battle takes place between Bruce Willis and James McAvoy and that is the majority of the film. Although these movies were good I felt that they were lacking in a few areas. The first being that we didn't get too much of a backstory into why Bruce Willis thinks he is unbreakable. We are shown different scenarios where he survives death but we don't really see the path that is inherent of himself that shows why he believes he is unbreakable. We also learn that Samuel L Jackson is in charge of a lot fo various attacks on the innocent public, but we don't see how he become such a hard and evil man or the path that brought him to that point. In Split we see the various personalities of James McAvoy but we don't learn the process that goes into him creating these multiple personas and that leaves us wondering how he was able to obtain them and why they are they way they are. IN Glass we witness a culmination of the last two films and this leads us to the climax fight between Bruce Willis and James McAvoys ultimate personality the beast. This fight was less than exciting and did not do much justice into who is truly stronger. Lastly what ruined these movies for me was the fact that James McAvoy kills two of this girls friends in Split, but then in Glass the girl who survived is more than willing to be a close friend to James McAvoy.",Glass

3.The cinematography was amazing.
4.Dialog was great as well.

I think my self and a lot of others were very disappointing to see David like that it felt unfulfilling and just wrong. it kind of broke me down from loving the film.

As if the watcher has no right to say it's a bad movie because he probably couldn't understand it?
No.
The only thing good about this movie is the quality of acting. The story was at least unfinished but actually I think it never made any sense at any moment in the development of this movie. It's completely rubbish and everyone who worked on this movie must have felt that aswel. Probably the amount of money generated was of bigger importance.
Besides all of this I start to notice that indeed there are many fake reviewers nowadays on IMDB, probably hired to promote the movie. When you read those after you've seen the movie, you will notice that their reviews even don't make any sense aswel. They are just blathering about.
Finally I want to underline my aversion of this movie by the amount of marvel I experienced when I saw the estimated cost of making this. 20 Million Dollar? What the effing eff??? Where did all that money go then? Was there a stunning CGI part of 45 minutes in the movie that eventually was editted out or something?

Split was the same; the writing, acting and tone of the movie made me want it to run another hour.
I love them both.However,
Glass, I feel is a wasted opportunity. The acting is brilliant from Samuel L Jackson, Bruce Willis and notably James McAvoy; who I still find it hard to believe has not received an Oscar nor for his portrayal of Kevin Crumb.While the premise and theme of the movie is an interesting topic which was explored in the previous 2 films. I feel this film could have explored it further and not settled, for what I feel, is a weak cop out for a twist.The film had so much promise and I was so eager to watch it since seeing Split.Unfortunately, the basis of both previous films may have heightened my expectation somewhat.

The death of all three left me feeling empty and sad but at the same time it made me realize that this was necessary to help the other extraordinary people like them.
It's not like the Avengers and other regular superhero movies. It's weird, beautifully weird. It shows us what could real-life superheroes be like.
M. Night Shyamalan doesn't get enough recognition and credit for his great storytelling and writing. Glass was well written and directed just like Unbreakable and Split and also had the unexpected twist we all were expecting.

The rest of this movie was a steaming pile of garbage.
I held on, hoping for a shred of something good, but was met with even more ways to make viewers cringe.
The cinematography was terrible, character direction didn't even follow basic tips such as, if you're monologuing, it's not the back of your head we should be looking at the whole time! Not nearly enough explanation about the ""superhero killers"", no character development and minimal motivation explained from NPCs (so, Elijah's orderly was a good guy, but then he was cruel?) basic, terrible writing, I could go on.
If a movie like this tries to meet the lofty goal of interpreting the Superhero Reveal, as well as wax poetic about the rules of comic books (which, really, was not necessary, and Jackson's constant, ""Ah, yes, now this is the part when..."" was condescending and underestimated its audience), take your time, do the research, and do your characters and audience justice.",Glass

He just broke through a plastic water tank while holding off the Beast... so some guy is going to be able to drown him.. yeah right... totally disrespected the character which in my opinion is unforgiveable. He was a hero and if your Kill him off at least give him a hero's death.I think M Night has great ideas but just has no clue how to get them to the finish line. I suppose that when you have the 6th Sense there is no where to go but down. It's like he does not want to understand what audiences want as ending to movies. This did a disservice to David and Mr. Glass. They could have easily spent less time with Kevin, omitted the idiotic scene with M Night in the security store, spent less time with the ""psychiatrist"" and more with Sam and with Bruxe. A few tweaks to allow David to escape and then let Glass be imprisoned again would have resulted in a much more satisfying ending.There are a ton of other Logical errors, like why doesn't the Beast come out as one of the personalities when the lights flash. Why doesn't he just close his eyes and cover them with the pillow and then crash into the light.. a 9 year old could of figured that out...One person's opinion",Glass

1677,tel_ion,post-truth,8,23 January 2019,"'Glass' is possibly a movie about the antagonism between reality and fiction as seen from within the perspective of the latter: fiction creates reality. The sect of people trying to level out the extraordinary (which can be produced by imagination or fiction etcetera) could be read in a symbolic way as the academic or scientific community and their channels of negotiation and mutual recognition - whence the ""imposition"" of explanations and paradigms. This sect, however, is implicated in the fable of the mastermind; it is determined by the overarching power of story-telling: it is a fiction in itself. I want to understand the final scene as a warning against placing too much confidence in iffy beliefs. A screen is neither the source nor the criterion of truth. However, it seems that progressively it is becoming one. Such a development can bring about monsters - and who is going to confine them if rationality is part of the fabric of fictions? The answer is heroes. But is it a good one?",Glass

The build up till the events at the mental asylum has been well executed, however the pace gets dampened thereafter pretty much till the interval and the performances of lead actors being the only highlight during this period.Post interval the movie picks up remarkably and reaches it's peak by the last 20 minutes. The climax has been the best part about the movie. The emotional quotient towards the end hits the right note considering this is a grounded superhero movie and as close as it can get to reality.There is a clear message that Shyamalan wanted to convey and he has done something totally brave and unexpected of a Super Hero Genre movie at the climax. Had this not been self financed I am pretty much sure the climax would have never been accepted by the studios. Shyamalan has been very true to what he had in mind with the end product.Performances especially James Mcavoy & Sarah Paulson have been another strength of this movie.Don't go by the Rotten Tomatoes score, it is very much up to what you would expect from a Shyamalan film.",Glass

If you have seen Unbreakable and Split then you should understand the tone of this film. Bruce Willis was amazing as David Dunn once again, critics say his performance seemed phoned in, which means they must not of remembered Unbreakable at all! David Dunn is a quiet reserved person who pushes away the people he loves to protect them from danger.
Samuel L Jackson did a amazing job as Mr. Glass, Every single speech he gave in this movie was very powerful. James MCavoy was amazing as KEVIN WENDELL CRUMB, even better than he was in SPLIT.

I don't understand how this script got green lit it's terrible there's so much pointless dialogue I kept zoning out for most of it. This movie has nothing going for it other than a few interesting camera shots and some good acting. James McAvoy is great but that's the only high point of this dragged out mess and this movie felt like it would never end and when it did I was so disappointed in that ending i was going to explain it but I can't remember what's happens but basically the 3 main protagonist after having a ""showdown"" are killed by a Secret group of people who just kill superheroes no matter if they do bad or good I can't remember why.

Now when you watch this film I want you to do one thing, keep in mind this tidbit of information visualize this film as an actual graphic novel. View it as if it were inked and not shot and your perspective on this film will change.

A truly excellent product, Cinema for high and sensitive minds. Show to reflect on our existence using archetypes and almost alchemical references.
Suffice it to think of the continuous and stressed reference to number 3 or the events of the Ulysses of the Odyssey of which the film is full of quotations from the attentive spectator.Bravo, Shyamalan.

My hopes fell however after the trailer's cliche portrait of a psychiatric hospital treatment and the negative critics at rotten tomatoes, metacritic and etc. But reading the positive review from IMDB-users, who opposed the before mentioned sites, I was thrilled to go to the cinema. Having now watched the movie, I do see why some find it polluted with clichés and over acted characters. But if you appreciated Shyamalan's previous chapters (Unbreakable and Split) you will be pleased to find a movie that continues the high quality of ""realistic superhero movies"". With Glass, Shyamalan once again makes me wonder if maybe, somehow, there really can be extremely gifted humans/creatures on our planet. None of the Marvel/DC-movies have ever come close to that.

Also the movie goes to hell in the third act, and we get to see a very confusing plot twist which is definitely not good. Also, the flick present us certain situations that are not addressed later, such as the flashbacks and the big urban battle tease.

Plot - full of holes, not a worthy (potential) ending to this trilogy.
Dialogue - very poor.
Anya Taylor-Joy is not a bad actress per se but her role in this movie is unnecessary. Some might say that she was needed in order to show that the Beast could be better, could be controlled and etc. However, this could have been achieved in other ways, much more entertaining ways.
The ending - very, very bad ending. I thought that the writer had something going on but to end the trilogy with this secret society thing was a really bad idea.",Glass

I was very pleasantly surprised, excellent storyline, excellent ending, excellent acting from McAvoy particularly.
I'm really struggling to think of a better trilogy of films especially of this type.

1759,Caseyrector100-870-766904,They messed up,4,19 January 2019,"I think a 4 for this movie is pretty generous. They could've done so much better. This movie connected two very good movies by themselves, but it comes off as forced and seems almost a bit rushed (which is odd considering Unbreakable came out in '02). Let me preface by saying that James McAvoy was phenomenal. I would probably argue that he was even better in this movie than in Split. He was by far the brightest spot in the movie. He makes his character seem so believable for such an outlandish disorder. I mean the man literally had to play two dozen different characters, and he does it in a way that stays consistent and believable. Additionally, I thought Bruce Willis was generally good as well as Samuel L. Jackson being great too. The problem wasn't the actors or even they're acting at most parts. The problem to me seemed to be the plot and the dialogue. It seemed... fake. I know this is ironic considering I just discussed how believable McAvoy was, but everything else dialogue-wise seemed too basic. Oh, and the plot? A big let down in the end. The plot twist makes 0 sense whatever. Rather, it makes sense, but what doesn't make sense is how Shamalayn couldn't possibly come up with something better or something that connects to the other two movies or even THIS MOVIE ITSELF. It wasn't a twist in which you'll have to rewatch it and say ""ohhhhh I see, we missed that the first time."" No. It'll make you say ""what the hell was that all about?"" or ""what the HELL was that all about?"" Listen, I wanted to like this movie, i really did. I thouroughly enjoyed Split, and Unbreakable has been one of my favorite movies since before Split. And there were good aspects to this movie too, don't get me wrong. But the cons outweigh the pros heavily. It could've been done way better for sure, and it'll leave fans of the predecessors like myself wishful for what could've been.",Glass

The movies weren't flawless but they were a breath of fresh air.

I really enjoyed this film.Positives: James McAvoy is a lot of fun! He steals every scene he's in. The action was pretty good for a film that takes place in a very slow paced series. I've seen critic reviews complaining about the film being slow at times, I assume they haven't seen Unbreakable. Really liked Mr. Glass and for a film that relies heavily on dialogue, it kept my interest. The ending felt anti-climatic but I expected that based off of the previous films. I liked the conclusion for Kevin since he is finally at peace and Mr. Glass for outsmarting the organization sent to kill them.Negatives: Did not like the conclusion for David (Bruce Willis's character). As a fan of Unbreakable, I liked that his son finally got what he wanted which was for the world to see the hero his father is but it still fell flat. Willis was really underused in this film. I wish we could've learned more about this organization that sent the doctor to stop these superior beings. The doctor mentioned going to another town so that could hint at another sequel in the future where we hopefully get it. Finally, the security for that hospital sucked. Not enough guards to guard super heroes/villainsThe film definitely has flaws but is still pretty enjoyable if you're a fan of the previous films. I would watch it again",Glass

I now firmly believe Unbreakable and Split should've remained standalone films, because I feel like Glass had a negative effect on both previous films. M. Night created these incredible characters in their own stories, but bringing them together made me think of a kid combining the play of his G.I Joe with his dinosaur toys in the sandbox and trying to relate one to the other. 6/10, and you'd be better off remembering David Dunn as he was in Unbreakable.",Glass

1817,reidmkerr,Underrated masterpiece,9,3 February 2019,Glass in my opinion is extremely underrated. Critics tore this movie apart and docked it for its twist ending in particular. I'm not going to say what the ending is but people have criticized it for being somewhat anticlimactic. Yes it isn't what you expect it to be but it works very well for this movies. Take unbreakable for example; it isn't a full high budget super hero movie but That's not what it's trying to be. It's trying to make you think and the same goes with glass. The ending of glass is trying to make you think and I thought it was a great way to wrap up the series. On top of that the acting was incredible. Sam brought back the Mr Glass character completely and he seemed as if he was very invested in this role. Bruce was out off to the side for a pretty big chunk of the movie (my only complaint) but showed investment in his character for the first time in years. I actually haven't seen Bruce Willis look like he is trying since maybe.. Red? or Die Hard 4? To top of the movie and to make it a masterpiece was the performance led by James MacAvoy. He portraid his role of the hoard in one of the best possible ways I could imagine and that was his best performance in his carrer in my opinion. Anyways 9/10. Great movie!

Movie had no actors by the way other than main characters streets looked empty..even when cops came they were like 4 regular guys in cheap uniform...but am fine with that if the script was okay..two small examples even I can make 10000 examples about how silly this movie is
Samuel Jackson mom is same age as him in the movie..he is on wheelchair but how he managed to wear a tuxedo
David and the beast fight in a water tank inside it looked huge but when it was breaking down the tank is same size as one I have on the roof
Scenario oh well that's the longest boring dialogue i had to encounter
So at the end one hero is killed by a sniper sitting on a veggie van painted to look like a cop van and the other was drawn in a water hole by some guy while his son watching with two cops from far and only came to rescue after ..blend movie am outrageous about the fake reviews here.. tomatoes gave it 35% please save ur hard earning money..we should sue that lazy director",Glass
1822,erikdillehay,Glass is full of class,10,18 January 2019,I'm so glad that he made this a trilogy rather than making 6 more of these for a money-grab. Excellent movie in all phases (especially the music). In the last 15 minutes there were 5 that I wasn't sure on how I felt about the ending. And then it sunk in. M. Knight is the man. I'm glad he kept it in the parking lot and didn't take the fight to the building. Classy.,Glass
1823,spamnow,Good overall story but too slow,5,19 January 2019,"As the name suggests, this movie revolves around Mr. Glass. While the story is interesting the build up for the movie took too long and towards the middle part it's extremely slow. The story isn't progressing as much and there isn't much to look forward to. The ending is good (depending on your taste) but the directing seems a bit sloppy.",Glass

1825,tommasomarra,It just doesn't seem fair to rate this film less than 8/10,10,4 May 2020,"If you liked the first two movies then you'd love this one too. Outstanding acting, outstanding plot, which seems to lead you towards one way and suddenly changes during the last minutes. The characters were built so well that I nearly cried at the end. Most of people say this film looks ""empty"" and that is basically throwing away a wonderful idea because of the uncommon and bitter ending.
Instead, I would say that this is the true strength of the movie. In this movie (let's say in this whole 3-movies-cinematic universe) heroes aren't like the ones we are used to see, they don't have powers recognisable at first sight, in fact they were all close to believe their abilities didn't actually exist, so I would say they are more human than actual super-heroes.
And this is portrayed in the best way possible during the whole length of the movie, especially at the end. We all know that real life is sometimes bitter and sad, and this bitter ending shows best the true human nature of the main characters as, of course they have superpowers, but they're still human, they're not invincible, and this in particular makes them look ""true"" and ""normal"" to our eyes, as if we could easily imagine being one of them, and this empathy is one of the things that made me like this movies more than othersof the same genre. If you want to see super-heroes winning every battle in the very end, then Marvel or DC won't disappoint you, but this movie shows us that nobody is truly invicible when facing reality. ""Bad"" endings like this one are greatly underrated.",Glass
1826,brian-m-adkins,What if comic book heroes and villains were real?,10,20 January 2019,"M. Night Shyamalan is a film maker that critics seemingly love to hate, but the culmination of his 20-year Eastrail 177 Trilogy has been beautifully accomplished with his latest movie, Glass. Starring Samuel L. Jackson as the titular character, Glass serves as a dual sequel to the otherwise standalone films, 2000's Unbreakable and 2016's Split. Bruce Willis and James McAvoy reprise their roles as the David Dunn and the Horde, respectively. Glass captures this comic book fan's daydream question, ""what if comic book heroes and villains were real?"" This could easily be the tagline for the entire trilogy and could serve as the only marketing necessary to entice those fans of comic lore and mythos.Glass, as well as Unbreakable and Split, take a darker and more earthy approach to the super- genre, and is riddled with adult themes, but handles them in a non-gratuitous manner, in keeping with Night's notable style. Also, in keeping with Night's films, there is no shortage of turns and twists within this tale, and the finale, although seen by some as underwhelming in comparison to the intergalactic warfare of the Marvel Universe, ends with a satisfying feeling of closure. If you enjoyed Unbreakable, and enjoyed Split, you will certainly enjoy Glass.Glass is the sweet dessert at the close of a fine three-course meal; leaving you with a taste of something wonderful and the sadness of its end.",Glass

What is shocking and refreshing is the slant taken on what is now a lucrative and possibly saturated superhero genre: Shocking because this is not the action packed hero blockbuster film you may have come to expect, however it is a refreshing look at the - what if superhumans did exist - that the latest branch of superhero shows such as umbrella academy or boys are exploring.The film itself is well produced, has an exceptional cast and a storyline that should keep most from wandering what their phone is doing!
A 9 or even 10 out of 10 would have been awarded had there have been a more climactic end to this finale, however my displeasure in the absence of such an ending may be down to my expectations given the recent marvelesque type sagas or perhaps this is not the last we will see of this storyline in which case the lackluster yet thought provoking ending can be forgiven.",Glass

1866,kaiqizheng,"A Rather weak Story, but not without its Merits",6,20 January 2019,"So, before I start my review, I just wanna make it clear that I'm not an adrenaline junkie. I actually think it's cool that Shyamalan did not give us a huge showdown at a huge site. I think it's awesome that the Beast is killed because he is made vulnerable through an emotional connection with Casey. Even more so than McAvoy's great performance, this juxtaposition between a superpowered body and a mind in shambles is in fact why I personally enjoyed the Beast's character so much.With that said, however, I must also say that I absolutely detest the general direction this film took. Throughout the entire story, the biggest feat of power is probably when the Beast flips a cop car over, and historically, a handful of angry guys at a protest gone violent have managed to do the same thing. These people being portrayed on-screen--David, Elijah, Kevin--are all quite easily subdued by mortal methods, and are barely worth being called ""extraordinary"".Now, of course, I fully understand that Shyamalan wanted a more realistic story, but the problem here is that he seems to have some severe misconceptions about the concept of ""realistic comic book movies."" Simply put, this goal of realism in a story does not require the story's characters to all be as physically weak as the ones in ""Glass"". When a superhero story is ""grounded in reality"", it only means that the cast all handle the emergence of the supernatural in ways that are psychologically plausible, relatable to the audience, and also accurate to all of the story's previous establishments. It means that the way a supernatural power effects the world is realistic, but the power itself can be as outlandish as it wants to be. Blockbuster-esque actions where the main characters casually backhand minivans into the sky can be perfectly realistic, so long as the mental activities of said characters are real and human, and the world around them also reacts like a real world dealing with utter insanity. As a matter of fact, without these powers that require audiences to completely suspend disbelief, a story tends to get dull and pointless.Perhaps this is an unfitting example, since neither characters I'm about to mention have actual superpowers, but if Nolan's Batman and Joker were not ten steps ahead of the cops at every turn, people would start wondering why they should want to watch the story of these two despite Heath Ledger's amazing performance. The reason people watch these films IS to see the extraordinary, to experience ""kicking ass and taking name"" vicariously through relatable and lovable characters. When these super heroes or super villains consistently fare no better than an ordinary man against purely physical obstacles, we naturally will no longer want to see them.To make the limited power of each character much more of a problem, if Shyamalan wanted to create a superhero story grounded in reality, why would he implement a whole secret society? That is perhaps one of the most unrealistic tropes in all of fiction. Personally, I think that men with enough strength to benchpress skyscrapers are much more believable than a thousand-year-old secret organization that hunts those kind of men. Certainly, this ""twist"" justifies the public's ignorance toward the superhuman, but it does so at a very hefty cost. Compare this ""creative licensing"" to the harsh limits placed on the powers of each character, and Shyamalan's self-contradiction becomes quite clear.Honestly, I'll admit that I went into the film with pre-set expectations, so I am very much a biased viewer. ""Unbreakable"", despite being very quiet and introspective, was still very much an origin story. Then, ""Split"" was a crime thriller where a mentally-ill man kidnaps three girls, until the very last act. So, understandably, I fully thought that David and the Beast would both be significantly more mature and full of badassery by the events of ""Glass."" I also may have expected a bit more ""Beauty and the Beast"" style interaction between Casey and...well, the Beast. Further, the film did have its noteworthy moments, both in the character interactions and the actor performances. The moments of levity were welcomed, while the few cases of dialogues existing pure for exposition are more or less a staple to all modern films and thus negligible. However, at the end of the day, I cannot say that this film even comes close to matching the experiences that were its two predecessors. As a film by Shyamalamadingdong, this is definitely not the worst that could have happened, but still...",Glass

1885,nickeltristyn,Better than the critic score,8,22 January 2019,"SPOILERS!!This movie continues from Split and Unbreakable where things are the same: Hedwig, Patricia and Dennis (Kevin's personalities) are feeding the impure to the Beast and David is fighting crime undercover, now with the help of his son. Elijah is in a psych ward, heavily sedated.The first act is solid, where we find out where things are at and how David and the Beast fight and are caught by Ellie Staple. The way that she believes that they are simply human but still keeps things that could weaken them at her disposal, like the water in David's room, if he was simply human then there would be no way that he could get out the metal door. Same with Kevin. That was very well set up and displayed.Act two on the other end was tedious and boring and there were no parts that hooked me, it was all about Ellie trying to convince them that they were all just human in the least interesting way - talking to them. At this point, I was almost begging for the end.Act three was the best, it had plan, action and a whole new understanding to it. I expected it to go in a completely different way but it surprised me. The action sequences were not the only good part but so was the pre-planning that Elijah does. We all expect it to go the way that it was said it would but it made a lot of sense when the ending came around. The fight between David and the Beast is spectacular with his origin being revealed and him still fighting for control.Their deaths were the hardest parts for me to accept, I just couldn't believe that they were dead, it almost seemed like a trick but it was real, alas.James McAvoy is one of my favourite actors and he shines just as bright in this film as he did in Split. We see more of Kevin's personalities and understand even more about Kevin and why his personalities, especially the Beast help him. In Split, it was always one personalities after the other and we saw the change from one to another, rarely. In this film, the way he changes his personalities is almost believable. The changes are so fluid and are recognisably different. We can tell who is who from the way they behave and it also creates a sense of unease but also a warmth and a sense of intimacy between the viewers and the character, where we have seen so many sides of him that most people wouldn't.Anya Taylor- Joy's acting is also wonderful. She's truly a star at her age. I can't wait to see her in more films!I understand why the ratings were so low, it's because the first and the third acts were fast paced and entertaining whereas the middle act was dragged and felt tedious and made me want to sleep through it, because if you skipped it, the movie would've still made sense.Overall, I really enjoyed it, and honestly, I shed a few tears for my heroes in this film that died, especially Kevin.

The dialogue sounds like it was written by a fourth grader who reads comics and that's it. Willis, Jackson, and especially Macvoy did a great job with their acting, but everyone else was so dissapointingly trash. Things just start happening near the end of the movie with no explanation. Everyone stares at the main three battle it out. And might I add these might be the worse policemen ever?! And the dumb plot twist at the end when she leans over to Bruce Willis and says 'Hey so this was all pretty much a prank. Did I prank you??' And she turns out to be apart of some organization that wants all 'superheroes' to die. Wtf is going on in this movie. Even before the last thirty minutes there are several things that just don't make sense. Like if they have 3 super-people locked up, why is there only one guard on night shift? Why does that one dude keep flashing the lights at Kevin when he's in his room? If that video of everyone being super-human was released, it wouldn't go viral, people would think it's just cool editing and choreographed. How did they find Dunn and Kevin at that warehouse at the beginning of the movie? And lastly of the many, why does this lady specialize in people who believe they're superhuman when she's only ever found one person, Elijah? Before she found Elijah, what was she doing with her made up profession? Like wth?!",Glass

Knowing precisely where he wants to take this movie, Shyamalan gives the audience what they want right off the bat: a showdown between David Dunn and ""The Beast,"" but sadly, due to its brief length and premature occurrence, the fight lacks interest and memorableness. Despite the dissatisfying quarrel, I did enjoy the rest of the set-up that the first act had to offer and was excited to see Shyamalan's universe unravel. Unfortunately, what follows is what is my main gripe with the movie: nothing happens in the second act of the film. We simply observe our three ""supers"" rot in an inert institution and I quickly grew tired of the gag of watching McAvoy switch personalities and Paulson spewing repetitive dialogue. Although even an immaculate ending would have been unable to recover what the second act squandered, I did enjoy most of how Shyamalan decided to simultaneously conclude this film and his trilogy, with the exception of the reveal of Paulson's character's background.",Glass

Night ran a good idea and potentially good ending to his trilogy and ran it into the ground through the production alone. It was written, shot, and produced badly. It felt like M.

1902,felixdleveque,Disappointing,3,7 February 2019,"Anyone who's a fan of Unbreakable will be disappointed by this film. This is mainly a Split sequel and what they do show of David Dunn is mediocre at best. The best part of the film are the first 15 minutes and even that was pretty lame. What could have been an exciting film is almost entirely in an institution where Sarah Paulson delivers some of the dumbest dialogue I've seen in a Shyamalan film. James McAvoy does a good job but his performance is much better in Split. Bruce Willis is not in this film very much and when he is he doesn't seem to care about it very much. Samuel Jackson is not in this movie very much either despite having the movie named after him and his dialogue is pretty bad. The supporting characters in this film seem very shoehorned in and have very little plot significance. The fights are poorly choreographed and not exciting. The ending is a slap in the face to anyone who cares about Unbreakable. The twist in this movie is really stupid, it doesn't make much sense, it isn't set up at all, and it makes you question the point of everything that happened before it. This film isn't completely terrible I was never bored and there are a few cool scenes here and there but it's just so disappointing.

1909,extremematrix,"Well crafted, acting was oscar worthy, but you need to keep an open mind.",7,20 January 2019,"This is my first review, but as a movie lover i will do my best. So the movie is more of a thriller, mystery and psychological horror than a superhero movie. The superhero genre is a sub plot, the major focus is the genres stated before. During the first act, the plot focused on david dunn and the beast, with beautiful and blood pumping soundtracks to keep us entertained. This is our first fight scene between the two, and you can see a dramatic difference in power struggles.I have two problems with this movie, the first one being the lack of the main hero, who only plays a major part in the first act and the third act, the second being more focused on our villians. The second problem is the set up to the ending, i have a feeling this ending was meant to shock the audience by killing off the three main characters of this movie. If the director had put more effort into the script to hint at the future plot twists, the audience may be more satisfied with the ending.Those are my problems, but this movie has alot going for it. The soundtrack was very intriguing and i loved listening to it. There are multiple scenes of tension and suspense that literally had my heart beating faster cause i was so scared or worried. For example the scene where mr glass is being harrassed by the caretacker, and his threats to hurt Mr Glass left me in suspense. The characters were really well crafted, i loved the characters portrayed by James McAvoy, he deserves an oscar for such a intense performance. As stated before, Bruce Willis needed more screentime in the second act, to develp the audiences connection to the character.The ending was the most controversial part of this film, as it will divide the audience to people who love the film to others hating it because it finished like this. In the end, three things happen, two happen at the same time, this being the three major characters deaths and the reveal that there is an organization dedicated to holding disbelief in the public that superheroes do not exist. This reveal was suprising to those not paying attention, so there will be people who saw this coming, and people who dislike it because they didn't. The last BIG plot reveal was that Mr Glass had predicted the organizations attempts to cloud the publics eyes about the presence of superheros, so he used the cameras set up to monitor the three super characters to reveal to the world they exist. This was an origin story for new superhero movies that can be set up in this universe. So we may see some spin offs. Mr Glass had duped both the audience and the major characters into proving the existence and potential of superheros around the world.This ending leaves people divided, which i praise the director for achieving, as this makes this movie more likely to be talked about in the future dispite the possibility to have majority of audience members disliking the movie because of its unpredictable plot. I loved this movie, not for all people, but expect an entertaining movie to watch that goes beyond a superhero movie and becomes a psychological thriller/mystery.",Glass
1910,jackmckinney-24346,20 years in the making,8,23 January 2019,"There are very few movie sequels that come 20 years after the original that are worth watching but Glass is up there with the likes of Bladerunner 2049 and Toy Story 3. Glass is the culmination of Unbreakable and Split resulting in a film that delivers an interesting story and a worthy addition to the superhero genre. Glass is a superhero film that is the polar opposite of a Marvel movie, the film has two main fight scenes, at the beginning and at the end. The film explores what makes each of its characters heroes and villains. While I do feel that David Dunn was the weakest of the three main characters I felt his presence in the film gave the audience the ""hero"" character with his story revolving around his acceptance that he is not a superhero. David Dunn towards the end of the film has accepted that his abilities are not powers before being shown that he is more than what he believes and that he alone can stop Mr Glass in a final showdown. Speaking of Mr Glass I think that Samuel L Jackson's performance in this film is incredible, and that's saying something considering he doesn't speak a word for over an hour of the run time. Mr Glass is always the smartest person in the room and I feel his intelligence perfectly contrasts his physical weakness in this film. He is able to trick every single character in the film and in the end, he wins. There are very few superhero films where the villain wins and even fewer where you are happy that they win. Mr Glass by the end of the film has finally shown the world what he is and that there are more like him, which in the end was all he ever wanted. James McAvoy's performance in this film is simply phenominal. His ability to juggle multiple characters throughout the film takes a lot of time and effort to pull off and he should recieve an award for this performance. While his characters ""tragic backstory"" is a little bit cliche and his connection to unbreakable was very predictable with his father, by the end of the film I felt as though his character had finally found some piece with Kevin holding the light, at the end. In conclusion I felt that Glass was an incredible way to end the trilogy, while I know the ending is polarising for many viewers I feel satisfied knowing that, while I had lost all the main characters, their deaths served a purpose greater than themselves. Mr Glass showed the world superheros in the same way action comics #1 showed the world superheroes. All it takes is for the world to see one man lifting a car.",Glass

1925,mrmenacing,A decent but underwhelming end to the trilogy,6,12 February 2019,"GLASS was just.. ok.Before I go into detail, I need to take a minute to talk about UNBREAKABLE and SPLIT.I loved UNBREAKABLE. When you hear there's going to be a superhero movie starring Bruce Willis what do you imagine? Something fast-paced, action packed, and rife with special effects? UNBREAKABLE was the exact opposite, and that's what I loved about it. It's a superhero origin story, but it's a drama! It's one of the few movies where Bruce Willis doesn't play Bruce Willis (you know what I mean).Many people didn't like UNBREAKABLE because it wasn't what they thought it would be. They wanted suspense. Thrills. A stereotypical a$$-kicking Bruce Willis movie. I get it. That's not what UNBREAKABLE was. That's not what UNBREAKABLE tried to be. Expecting DIE HARD and getting UNBREAKABLE is like biting into a chocolate chip cookie only to find out it's oatmeal raisin. It's not what you wanted, so it left a bad taste in your mouth.I had no idea what UNBREAKABLE was about when I walked into the theater. Going in with no expectations helped me appreciate UNBREAKABLE for what it was. I enjoyed the slow pacing. I enjoyed a superhero origin story that relied on writing rather than special effects. I enjoyed the bleak (but not too gritty) tone. I enjoyed the realistic world that Shyamalan slowly created throughout the film. Most of all I loved the characters. I loved the dynamic between protagonist, everyman David Dunn, and antagonist, the enigmatic Mr. Glass.-SPLIT was the sequel I didn't even know I was waiting for. 16 years.. Shyamalan really played the long game on that twist. I thought SPLIT was a good movie up until the end. The twist at the end casts the movie in a whole new light, turning a good movie into a great movie. It was a supervillain origin story all along! Good job Shyamalan! And Mcavoy! He acted circles around everybody else in SPLIT... and GLASS, too!-UNBREAKABLE and SPLIT, while existing in the same cinematic universe, had completely different tones. They seem like they happen in two different worlds. How do you blend two different worlds seamlessly enough to make it convincing? That's what GLASS attempted to do, but ultimately fell short.Instead of trying to marry the two worlds to each other, Shyamalan should have created a new world, entirely.This is a world where Elijah, David, and The Horde have realized their full potential. It would be interesting to see this new world through the eyes of Mr. Glass- The movie was named after him, and David and The Horde already had their time to shine in the prequels.-Shyamalan set out to answer the question ""What if superheroes were real?""Mr. Glass suggests that comic books are based on reality; comic book heroes are exaggerated versions of extraordinary individuals, whose abilities are based in science.This raises more questions. If extraordinary individuals exist, where are they? Wouldn't they be more visible throughout history? Wouldn't they be more visible in current news? Like David, many people with gifts might not realize they are special; but surely some of them would. Is David Dunn the only one?GLASS answers these questions when Dr. Staple's true identity is revealed.
'Woah! Dr. Staple was a bad guy?! Who knew!? What a twist!'...I'm kidding. I knew she was the bad guy since the previews. Didn't everybody?Dr. Staple obviously knew that David, Mr Glass, and the Horde were extraordinary. What I couldn't figure out was why she was trying to convince them otherwise. I thought that maybe she was special too, and her power was dealing with other superhumans for some nefarious reason. It turns out she belongs to a secret society of ordinary humans that has kept superhumans in-check throughout the ages.I like this idea, but not its implementation. I don't like that this secret society was revealed as a twist in the last five minutes of the movie.The secret societies matching tattoos and secret meetings were cheesy. That level of cheese has no place in a movie that strives for realism. It could have been handled better. It should have been explored a bit more thoroughly.The matching tattoos, for example- why clovers? Does each petal represent something? One petal for the hero, one petal for the villain, and one petal for the organization that keeps them in-line? That would have been interesting, but Shyamalan spent no time selling it!I like the idea of this secret society because humanity, as a whole, has always been more powerful than the individual superhuman. In a three-way power struggle between villains, heroes, and humanity- of course humanity would win. That's why supers have secret identities. That's why vampires know better than to attempt world domination. The ordinary man is weak, but mankind is indomitable.Humanity won the power struggle, and maintained it's hold on that power for 10,000 years by suppressing the extraordinary. It's such an interesting concept! It deserves more screen time!-I didn't like the the whole insane asylum angle. David Dunn is a senior frikken citizen who had been fighting crime, barehanded, for 15 years without injury. The Horde was taking bullets, bending bars, and crawling on ceilings. I don't buy that either man would question their abilities.Personally, I would have liked the movie more if Mr Glass and David Dunn had a Hannibal/Clarice-esque relationship.Example: Maybe Mr. Glass sees David fighting the Horde on the news, but the Horde escapes. Mr. Glass is the only one who knows David's identity, so he reaches out and offers his assistance in capturing the Horde. Of course Mr. Glass would be manipulating everybody.. But to what end? Only Mr. Glass would know.That would have been cool. Anything would have been better than Shyamalan's idea to shove everybody into an asylum. Asylums have been done to death in every medium.-If superhumans were real, what would their relationships with ordinary people look like?In UNBREAKABLE, David Dunn's wife is so averse to violence that David has to give up his life as a star athlete to be with her. David turns his back to the extraordinary part of himself. This slowly causes him to resent his life and the people in it. CHARACTER BUILDING! YES!When David re-embraces his gifts, how long does he hide it from his wife? Does he tell her at all, or does she find out on her own? What is her reaction upon finding out? How did it affect their relationship? Could she accept her husband for who he was? Would she leave him?Shyamalan decides to answer none of these questions. Instead he has David's wife die off-screen. It's such a huge mistake. It's such a wasted opportunity for the type of character building that made UNBREAKABLE so good!Even though we didn't get to see Robin Wright return as Audrey Dunn, I was happy to see Spencer Clark return as Joseph Dunn. I'm glad Shyamalan decided to flesh out the father-son relationship between David and Joseph. Joseph believed in David before David believed in himself. It's very appropriate that Joseph would grow up to be his dads 'guy-in-the-chair'.Charlayne Woodard and Anya Taylor-Joy reprise their roles as Mrs Price and Casey Cook, respectively.Mrs Price is devoted to her son, Elijah, in UNBREAKABLE. It's her defining characteristic. We don't get to see her reaction to Elijah being exposed as a criminal. In GLASS, we find that Mrs Price admonishes her sons wrongdoing, but still remains dedicated to him. It's very fitting for her character.When Mrs Price bought Elijah his first comic book, she set into motion a chain of events that lead three people to realize they are extraordinary. Without that first comic book, Elijah might not have become a villain while searching for a hero; the train wouldn't have crashed; David wouldn't have realized he was unbreakable; Kevin Wendell Crumb's father wouldn't have died in the crash; and The Beast wouldn't have been born. Mrs Price started it all, so she had to be there for the end.The appearance of Casey Cook seems entirely out of place. We're really supposed to believe that Casey would want to see the maniac(s) who had held her captive and cannibalized cheerleaders in front of her? I think Shyamalan brought Casey back so The Horde could have a mortal counterpart.There's a scene at the end where Joseph, Mrs Price, and Casey are all sitting together. Their characters share a bond. They are the surviving mortal counterparts to the fallen superhumans of the trilogy. It's a cool concept that requires the inclusion of Casey Cook. There just needed to be a better motive behind her presence, because right now it just looks like stockholm syndrome.-The death of David Dunn.. I have mixed feelings about it.On one hand, it sucks that after this many years, David Dunn is dragged face down through the mud, then drowned in A PUDDLE! It was hard to watch.On the other hand, this trilogy is supposed to depict what superhumans would be like in real life. In real life, the hero doesn't always die in an epic blaze of glory. Part of the secret societies mission is to convince the world superheroes don't exist. David Dunn had already been making a name for himself as 'The Overseer'. To show the world that superheroes don't exist, the secret society has to humiliate David before killing him. They have to send a message: ""How could The Overseer be special if he drowned in a puddle? That's not how superheroes die. That's how an ordinary person dies.. Right?""-I'm also pretty sure Shyamalan has no idea how to direct fight scenes.""Hey! Let's have a bunch of weird, close-up, first-person camera shots in our fight scenes!

1927,chrismiddleton-64873,The Master of Twist Does it Again,9,7 June 2019,"The anticipation of this film was exceeded by the film itself. As with unbreakable, and Sixth Sense the build up was slow and the clues were carefully placed. This is not an action movie (although there is certainly some great action), nor do the characters posess cgi enhanced super powers like the Marvel and DC crowd. This film is about suspense and the human interaction of the characters who possess special abilities. The first time I watched it I had anticipated an action movie or perhaps an action thriller, with those expectations the film was a little bewildering. However, viewed again with anticipation of a sixth sense or unbreakable, the slow unfolding of this story to its climax then twist was... masterful. I expect this film will be increasingly appreciated with time and those critics who judged quickly will come to appreciate it considerably more.",Glass
1928,GentlemanCritic15,Glass review,2,16 March 2019,"This film was kind of a difficult film to rate, for the most part the cinematography was decent, some scenes with good cinematography were the action scenes. I personally think that unbreakable had it much better. The acting for the most part was pretty good. James Mackavoy is always is a delite and his acting is always very entertaining to watch. The one thing that really brings this film down is the story and writing. The script was just really poor. There were so many plot holes and conveniences in the story. The dialogue was especially bad with the psychologist character. If they had just made a better script I might have really enjoyed this film.",Glass
1929,PosterBoyHollywood,Everything you need to know to be successful in life,8,20 January 2019,"The director purpose with his Split/Glass serie is to talk about self belief and how it can change you worldview and abbilities to fight life by trully believing, here displayed with the example of believing your a natural superhero and that comics are a reflexion of true possibilities hidden from people by secret organisations.
and of course cause its a great movie, it doesnt throw it to you, the movie let you doubting if they are real heroes or just strong people that believe they are the strongest in the world. And of course the movie is scientificly incorrect for the purpose of making the movie a real exiting movie and not a random documentary on discovery channel about hill people. Shyamalan also did a cool cameo in one of the scenes buying security equipement lol.

Still great movie.,7,19 January 2019,"I really enjoyed this film since I really liked the first 2 movies and I thought this was a good addition to the trilogy. The big problem I had was the ending.In my opinion it would have been better for them to kill off Mr Glass because then the ending could still be emotional and moving, but instead they kill all 3 of them, and David Dunn dies from getting his head dunked in a puddle which is just plain sad. Kevin Wendell Crumb also shouldnt have died, there could have been more they could do with his character down the road.I did love Mr Glass twist ending suicide mission part, that was awesome, and the evil organization was decent, and I really did like the end where the 3 supporting characters show the world that they exist. Seriously though, why couldn't the organization have inprisoned David and Kevin, Mr Glass was already dying so he would still fulfil his plot twist of showing the world they exist, and David and Kevin would still be alive, and it would still be moving and emotional and set up the potential for sequels or a post credits scene.Either way, despite the ending, I did enjoy this movie I really did like it and I think I'm gonna buy it on bluray when it comes out, I already have unbreakable.

The plot is good and keeps the film interesting throughout, the twist at the end was unpredictable and possibly sets up another film.
James McAvoy gave an absolutely amazing performance and he completely deserves a best actor award for this.It is relatively slow up until the end, and it is missing some more actions scenes in my opinion. I would have liked to seen some more power on display from two of the main characters.All in all, a good film, better than unbreakable and on par with Split. A fitting end to the trilogy.",Glass

1946,dcherwon,The Ultimate UnBiased Review,4,18 January 2019,"Let me start by saying that I loved Unbreakable and Split and that I was really excited for the remake. I was rooting for this movie even more after the critics gave it a lousy 35% on Rotten Tomatoes and went in with low expectations to not disappoint myself. But I was wrong. Eventually you just have to admit that throughout the movie, the critics were right about it and the flow of the plot. The character development was what I was looking for. That's what drew me to Unbreakable and continue with Split. But in comparison this was more like watching Escape from Alcatraz than it was a hero-esque movie - no joke.
I still have not given up on the Unbreakable theme, as I love the idea of a low key different universe of unknown heroes that struggle with self belief and obstacles they encounter. I just think that this type of series DESERVES another continuation, hopefully soon from someone who can garner the graces and blessings of M. Night to continue into this series and excel, whereas M. Night may eventually have to realize that he has done a disservice to the fans and will have to pass the torch to the next creator.",Glass

The viewing experience itself was great, although thinking about the movie in retrospect uncovered some minor grievances.I would recommend (re)watching 'Unbreakable' and 'Split' first due to the amount of callbacks, references... for an improved viewing experience (and they're good movies). If you like those movies, then this is a recommended watch, as it takes some of the best elements of both movies.--
What I think about the movie?The biggest highlight of this movie is definitely the acting performances of the main characters, especially James McAvoy. A satisfying bridge is made with the other movies, and the plot is solid at a high level.However, the movie starts to show some cracks in its overall execution during the second act, and starts to really break down in the third act. The epilogue left a rather bitter aftertaste when leaving the theater. The outstanding actor performances kept the movie entertaining, but I feel like the director really dropped the ball towards the end of the movie.A minor personal gripe was the inconsistency when it comes to on-screen violence. One moment they put it in your face, but most of the time, they completely avoid it, even though I have the feeling that it definitely would have benefited from it if it was done in a tasteful way. At no point was it as visceral as I wanted it to be.",Glass

1954,bkolar-89909,Glass holds water even if critic's heads don't,9,19 January 2019,"Please note: This first half of my review will contain no spoilers but the second half is an in-depth look at the ending in an attempt to explain the reasoning behind Shayamalan's seemingly shoed-in side plot that almost goes off the rails and successfully loses most of the audience.Glass is a wonderful ending to this unexpected trilogy. The acting is phenomenal (mostly look at James McAvoy), and the setting and score all play into the psychological aspect of the movie. The first half of the movie is outstanding. Seeing David and Kevin fight for the first time is an awesome scene and display of supernatural strength that's gripping until the very end. But that's not why most people are reluctant to see it. You see like most M. Night Shayamalan movies, there is an unexpected twist at the end, but there isn't just one. And this is where he twists the minds of his audience a little too much. By the end, if you can still understand what's going on, consider yourself lucky because many people don't. I could feel my understanding of the ending slip and I didn't completely get the reasoning behind all the twists until the next day. Nonetheless, if you enjoyed Unbreakable and Split, this movie is worth seeing. Just don't forget the question that all three of the movies are asking.Now onto the ending. Again I will say that from this point on my review will contain SPOILERS so if you haven't seen it and intend to please do not read on until after you've watched the movie. The negativity that Glass is receiving mostly is coming from the ending, where it is revealed that a secret society knew about their abilities and aimed to convince them that they were not superheroes and to kill them, all while keeping it out of the eyes of the public. And Mr. Glass knew this all along, which is refreshing seeing as how he's supposed to be the mastermind. The question of this trilogy is ""Are they really superheroes?"" And by the end it is revealed to us that, yes, they actually were. As insane as Mr. Glass sounded when he gave his ""I believe comic books are a lost form of communication"" or whatever speech, he was right all along, and he revealed it to the world, beating the secret society's intentions in the act. The idea behind the final act is not displayed well but the idea is strong, affirming that there are those with special abilities among us. I think the fumbled execution of the final act just lost most of the audience. But see without the secret society, Glass would still be the villain. He would still be trying to blow up the Osaka Tower and he may have succeeded in so but at what benefit to the plot? Glass wasn't a villain in a superhero world, he was a mastermind in the normal world, and his intentions were never to cause havoc just for the sake of it, we knew this in Unbreakable. His intentions were to create superheroes and then reveal them to the world, and he did just that.",Glass
1955,kxiong-74163,Patience and psychological,9,18 January 2019,This isn't your average superheroes movie so if you're thinking of a full blown action pack movie like marvel and dc then you'll be quite disappointed. This movie is very slow with lots of deep mind thoughts. Think of it as a psychological thriller. You need to be very patient with this movie to enjoy it otherwise don't bother. I actually really enjoyed it for its deep meaning and how the director reflected the whole superheroes genre into real life scenarios. It's actually a very scary thought of hope the ending played out but in a real world situation this is hope it really would go down.,Glass
1956,cosaratilla,"A bland film by itself, although a bad end to a so called 'trilogy'.",6,18 January 2019,"*SPOILER ALERT: If you wish to not have the events and details of this movie revealed to you, please either read with caution or don't read at all*
Before I start with the review of 'Glass' I want to clarify a unpopular opinion of mine, I feel as if the movie 'Split' and it's characters feels so losely connected to this trilogy. Sure they are both about humans having powers but the way they portray these films being connected feels so bland and almost lazy. Instead of it actually being believable it feels like M. Night just put the characters from this trilogy at the end of 'Split' because he felt like it. Look at it this way, 'Split' is connected to 'Unbreakable' but is 'Unbreakable' really connected to 'Split'? Or is it just one direction they are forcing down the road??
Now let's talk about the actual movie I'm reviewing. This movie had some good shots and color schemes it was bouncing around with. I also really liked the whole feel of this film until the final act came around. It felt like as if we were the ones trapped in this asylum too. Now the look of a film can't help the story of a film, this film is so lazy. I wouldn't call it predictable because atleast that means the person tried to write a story. This movie's story feels so lazy and slow. I felt like I was reading a bland boring comic book where you know the events of what's going on just not how it's going to be portrayed. Which I will admit is still better then having it predictable, that doesn't mean it really helps. This movie is decent. But very bad to a ending of a trilogy. This movie could have explored different themes and feelings but no it ends up being lazy and gives off a sorta ""really, THATS gonna be how it happens?"" feel. M. Night I respect you, I loved 'Unbreakable' and 'Split' but to just try to combine them together doesn't fit right in me you know? This movie was basically your generic villains teaming up comic story mixed in with the worst example of ""the mastermind tricking everyone"" plot twist. Like how is it a plot twist anyway? He could have still have people affected and know about the creatures if he had done the tower thing he had planned. Normally plot twists like this mean the original plan wasn't good so the mastermind had another one under the curtains, but this one WAS good- it's just M. Night trying to cram another plot twist in our faces.",Glass

It made people think that we live amongst exceptional people!!! That there is always some dark force in the shadows trying to make people doubt themselves and therefore trying to keep more possible extraordinary humans from reaching their potential!!!

Never since Blade Runner 2049 have I been so captivated by a theatre experience. The preformances are on point from all the main cast; standouts being McAvoy, and of course Jackson as the titled character. Shyamalan's movie pops off the screen with such a gorgeous use of colour homage to comic book stills. Situations that the movie puts you in actually make you question everything you just assumed to be true in the last two movies. The twists the movie takes actually surprised me, and several reveals left a smile on my face. Shyamalan successfully helms the surprising amount of action in the film! It appears very brutal and real. Not a fan of all the POV shots though. Kind of got annoying. Overall, this movie far exceeded my expectations. I could seriously say that this is my new favourite M. Night Shyamalan film.On a side note, the movie tries to crack a few jokes, but some ""real life"" references played off as jokes didn't land for me on my viewing.

1968,Daakblud,Glass movie ending is not to be taken literally,8,20 January 2019,"I am going to get straight to the point here. Ever since I came out of the movies last night something was bothering me. The ending to the movie ""Glass"" seemed very different to what I was expecting before going into the film. It was when one of my friends said, ""should have listened to rotten tomatoes"" it struck me. This whole movie was a mockery at the Hollywood critics and their criticism of M. Night shyamalan's East rail 177 trilogy.SPOILERS. DON'T READ PAST THIS IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE YET.
The whole movie had been a huge metaphor all along.The Overseer's son, The girl that was left unharmed by the Horde, and Mr. Glass's mom these three characters represent the movie goers / fans of the comic book movie franchises. Each one of those characters believe in the respective Heros like the fans do.Mr. Glass / Elijah is a representation of M. Nightshyamalan himself.Here's the kicker. The Clover society in the end is a metaphor to the critics. (Rotten Tomatoes' ""rotten"" splatter symbol = clover society's clover tattoo)Let me explain. When the Overseer and the Horde fight for the first time in the warehouse / factory and end up being caught by the good Doctor staples, it was attributing to the fact that these RT critics get to see the movie ahead of the rest of the world. The doctor tries so hard throughout the movie to convince them and their family that they are NOT real superheros and even almost succeeds in breaking their beliefs at one point. But not Elijah's. He is convinced that he and the others are indeed superheros. Ergo M. Night shyamalan tells us he believes these are his version of ""superhero "" movies.In the climax when the clover society kills the Overseer it is a reference to how the critics ruined the unbreakable movie's reputation.The Horde/Kevin gets shot in the abdomen, again referencing to the shots taken by RT critics on the movie Split. Only this time, he was able to see the light with the help of the Casey. Basically telling that despite of negative reviews from critics the movie reached the light because of the fans.It was revealed in the movie that clover society's true motive was to keep everything in balance basically referring to Hollywood critics not wanting superhero genre to be acknowledged the way movies of other genre are.And finally when the son of the Overseer, Casey the broken girl and Elijah's mother reveal the truth to the world it is referencing to the fans of the franchise and other movie goers going to the movies themselves to see how Glass is inspite of critics spewing negativity on RT and other review movie websites and form their own opinions on how the movie is.
That's my theory. It just shows the sheer brilliance and the typical flavor of M. Night Shyamalan movies.",Glass
1969,seekerofcoldanddark,A satisfying epilogue,8,20 January 2019,"With its unconventional and cerebral narrative, GLASS would be able to rise above the critics who found it half empty. M.

M. Night Shamalan is a master of providing clues and inuendos throughout. His dialog is smart and natural. The characters are passionate, complex and forgiveable.I love this arch. I love how each moment was crafted with such careful thought on Shamalan's part. It's rare and beautiful to witness.I really think Shamalan p.$$3d someone off in Hollywood at some point because I do not understand why the critics are always bashing him! His writing is amazing! His stories are intriguing and different. No one has ever thought to create a super hero arch that is possible within our universe and complex enough to make you wonder, ""Is it true?""McAvoy did a briliiant job, but so did Anya Taylor as his foil. Mr. Glass, David and Kevin all appeared to be physically or mentally powerful and yet powerless against the forces of nature and humanity. I experienced this movie feeling such a profound sadness for Kevin, the same loss the other characters felt and a wish for redemption.

1974,vidhulavijayan,A different Superhero movie...,9,21 January 2019,Glass is Elijah's story. The movie does have its flaws. The climax is heartbreaking. But the conclusion is always what would have happened . I loved it. It doesn't matter what critics say. It's all whether the viewer gets it or not. M Night Shyamalan is a visionary director. James McAvoy is a treat to the eyes. Would definitely watch again.,Glass
1975,ilkdp,Amazing Trilogy,8,21 January 2019,"Please don't listen to the critics. Before I dive into the review, I have to say that it's beginning to look like M. Knight is go to for negative for critics. I listened to some podcast reviews, and one source had a review online two weeks before the movie was released that was all about how this wasn't a real comic or like comic movies should be. They continue to dig up past bad reviews and its pretty apparent that they just don't like him. I liked this movie. Alot. I think I would have edited down some of the scenes, but as far as continuing the links and storylines between the three stories - the movie worked. The moodiness, enhanced by both the music and the lighting gives you a continued feeling of unease and helps to move the storyline forward. This is not a bloated CGI monster-piece. It's slower and more thoughtful and comes to a conclusion that I didn't love, but it made sense. I did re-watch both Unbreakable and Split before seeing this, and that helped me appreciate this connections in the movie, and James McAvoy is just amazing. Go see it, think about it and ignore the critics. They've got an axe to grind, and it's getting boring.",Glass

If I can believe in story of Batman'2008 or Birdman'2014 - this film similar to farce.
Even good playing of main actors don't save the situation.

1977,ryancallum-32989,Less could have been more.,6,21 January 2019,"I really wanted to like this movie. And for the most part, I did. Act 1 was probably the most entertaining bit. Act 2 slowed down quite a bit and became very dialogue heavy, but still formed an interesting character piece. And then M. Night once again got Act 3 of his movie immensely wrong. I can't even say I was surprised to be let down and confused in the end. I have come to expect this from M. Night by now.He took what should have been a simple superhero set up, and plagued it with an unexpected and unnecessary plot twist which arrived way too late in to the runtime. Less could have been more with this movie. The fans were invested already. There was no need to overcomplicate it. It was an attempt to be clever but it just didn't pay off. I know M. Night loves his twist endings, but this one really didn't need it. It needed a conclusion and the lack of one has left me walking away from Glass not fully satisfied.",Glass

There were also some nice bits of humor as well as references to the previous installments in the trilogy. It kept me entertained throughout the movie... until Shyamalan pulled his classic twist. This time it was just too many and left me unfulfilled. I saw another review saying that he forgot how to make a good ending in trying to make a twist. After the twist it felt like the whole movie was practically for nothing. I feel like this would have been a better movie if it had been directed by someone else who sticks closer to the normal layout. It was advertised as a crossover film with a nice fight scene between two powerful people, but after I just felt lied to. Overall, it was a good movie, but the ending was very disappointing.",Glass

But I am glad I watched it. Very nicely done, I think the ending is appropriate and people must be paid to give this a bad review. I honestly don't see why people would think it is bad. It is true that all the characters would not have the same amount of time to express themselves due to the short screen time, but story is well told. Good job M night.",Glass
1991,damlie-07984,"Brilliant idea, but poorly executed",7,28 January 2019,"Overall a good movie. For a thriller, we went in expecting far more action and thrill, but sadly it was mostly talking for the first hour and, at times was filled with confusing silent moments between characters that felt empty and did not add to the suspense at all.However, the two best parts of this movie has to be the cinematography and James McAvoy's performance; absolutely mind blowing how he switched from one personality to another!!!The biggest let down for us was the makeup of some of the leading characters! Did they run out of budget? Or did the makeup artists have no idea what they were doing? We're not ones to pick on these type of things, but it was very badly executed and sometimes distracted from the dialogue. A brilliant concept, but underwhelming to say the least.",Glass

How much Split impressed me, this movie has completely bored me. Split was such an unique, deep story with, of course, amazing performance by McAvoy. This movie, however, was anything but that... It is a wannabe Marvel movie (and I am really not a fan of superhero movies at all). It started ok, with some interesting insights into why they might think they are superhumans or not, but instead of deepening the story, it got so shallow that I my intellignece was offended. It was really a waste of time. Not to mention such lame, typical Hollywood cliché scenes..The only positive point was McAvoy's amazing performance.

Most didn't see coming!But this isnt a marvel movie and to compare it means your dont understand what M Night is going for. He was quoted saying this is a deconstructed superhero movie like the Sopranos with the mafia.The acting was suburb especially Paulson and McAlvoy.

And now this tries way too hard to tie everything together. In my opinion 'Split' should have have been a stand alone movie with its own sequels. And this movie should have been the sequel to 'Unbreakable' without Kevin and his personalities.

I will say, if you were a big fan of split for the suspense and tension and not so much unbreakable, you may not like glass. I can see why we people wouldn't like this movie. It's a completely different style and experience than the other two. However, what I love about this movie is that the experience I had, was something I never have had before, an original story line that was consistent over 19 years across 3 very different styles of movies with an arch that blew my mind. The critics are being way too hard on this movie. If you like Shyamalons style and are a fan of the other two movies as well as mythology type of movies then this one is for you.When my family asked what my favorite part was, I said just the fact that these unique original movies exists.

In this film we Get to see how Much has gone on in the past 19 years especially to David Dunn who has Been Doing some Vigil Anti stuff whilst keeping his head down. But all off this has changed since the reveal of the Beast at the end of Split now Dunn's character is on the Search for him. The two meet in a brawl with each other which leads to them being discovered by Sarah Paulsons Character Dr Eli Staple who believes that super heroes don't exist and it's all in them minds.James Mcavoy is the worth the price of the ticket as he gives an outstanding performance as the Beast who we get to see him play all 23 Different personalities. Samuel L Jackson as Mr Glass is also great to see him back playing the role again in such a creepy but delightful way which will please any of Sams Supporters,Glass is A very mixed bag it has really good elements to the film but has really weak ones which really does show in the film. Whilst it struggles to showcase what it really wants to be The film over all can be seen as an easy watch for a casual movie goer who wants to be entertained for the 2 hour run time. But if you are a film Of Unbreakable and Split you may be let down as it certainly feel anti Climatic as it reaches it's finally 15 minutes.I think the director needed to spend a little more time on the script and the tone of the film as these parts definitely could of used more work on.I would recommend this film to a younger audience as The Beast and The Comic Book Side to it would definitely be entertained by these parts.Overall a good watch to a trilogy that knowbody thought would happen",Glass
2014,cam-85046,Better Than You Think,10,20 February 2019,"Director M. Night Shyamalan brings together his two original stand out movies Split and Unbreakable to a dramatic conclusion in his new movie Glass. Glass is an amazing film with a great cast that is truly a real roller coaster from beginning to end. The plot is interesting with many twists within that weren't clearly foreshadowed before hand. It is about a trio of men that were deemed to have a psychological disorder where they believed they had super powers. Each of these men had ""super powers"" which were specific to events that happened to them. All of these men come together at a mental hospital under the head doctor, Dr. Ellie Staple. She attempted to get them to stop believing they have super powers. The three men eventually ""teamed"" up to show the world that super powers exist. They escape the hospital and begin to fight. Overseer vs. The Beast and Mr. Glass.
The first persons name is David Dunn, or as he calls himself, ""The Overseer"". He is a family man who was the sole survivor of a tragic train accident. After the accident, he gained super strength and endurance but also the weakness of getting wet. He always wears black poncho to keep his identity safe, but also protect him from rain or anything that would get him wet. He is the ""superhero"" of this movie. Next is Kevin, he is a man with 24 different personalities and one they all are scared of, ""The Beast"". The Beast is is incredibly strong, fast and can climb on any surface. He got his ""power"" as a way of coping from the continued abuse from his mom after his dad died. The final character of this movie is Elijah or ""Mr. Glass"". He is an extremely intelligent person, but he has Osteogenesis imperfecta. This disease means that he has extremely brittle bones that can break easily. He is the mastermind that works behind the scenes and he manipulates situations so that they always end the way that he wants. Mr. Glass and Kevin are the two ""villains"".
David Dunn is acted by Bruce Willis, James McAvoy is Kevin Wendell Crumb, and Samual L. Jackson is Elijah Price. Together they reprise the main characters from the former movies in which they stared in, Split and Unbreakable. Personally, I believe that the strongest performance came from James McAvoy as Kevin. In a way, he had to work 24 times harder than the rest of the cast. He had to bring life, individuality, and creepiness to each personality that Kevin had within him. He did an amazing job of not only changing his manner, but also his voice to perfectly bring out the difference in personality between each of the personalities in Kevin. His work as Kevin is truly amazing and such a feat to be able to provide not only diversity but a sense of creepiness that he constantly gave the audience. Samuel L. Jackson as Mr. Glass is also portrayed well. Jackson, while not as good as McAvoy, was able to show the brilliance and also weakness of Mr. Glass. A memorable scene of this is when Kevin as The Beast, grabs Mr. Glasses shoulder and instantly crushes it. Jacksons facial reaction and cries of pain were spot on. it could just be reading in to things, but in Jacksons eyes it truly showed the pain he was going through but also this sense that this is what he knew was going to happen. Being the calculating and intelligent character Mr. Glass is, Jackson portrayed it well. However Bruce Willis's acting as David Dunn or the Overseer, was lacking to me. He never seemed to amount to much and in general eventually bored me. He had no memorable scenes in which he showed strong acting or expression. Overall it was a weak representation of the Overseer and was not portrayed as strongly as McAvoy or Jackson.
Overall, Glass is a stunning psychological movie that kept the audience latched on until the end. The plot twists were unexpected and very strong so that the movie goer understood how it all fit in. It had a great psychological and thriller story line that also didn't leave the audience confused or lost in the action and thoughts. It's rated Pg-13 which is an appropriate rating as there is some violent and creepy scenes mainly having to do with Kevin. Glass is a brilliant film that I'd recommend to anyone who loves movies that make them think, and to anyone who enjoys a good plot twist.",Glass
