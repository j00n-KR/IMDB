0,MartinHafer,It's a Michael Bay spectacle...so turn off your brain and enjoy.,3,13 September 2020,"""Armageddon"" is a Michael Bay spectacle....which is why I never had any desire to see the thing. But a friend of mine, Angelo, begged me to see it...saying he thought I'd like it. So, as a favor to him, I saw this on DVD tonight. And, as expected, it was huge...with amazing CGI and stunts....and writing which was done by a couple really talented 6 year-olds. Yes...the writing is THAT bad. And, because of that, it falls into the category of a film you watch and enjoy AFTER you turn off your brain.A giant killer meteor is headed to Earth and will wipe out all life on the planet. So, the US government has a plan...to send a bunch of total misfit oil drillers to drill and then detonate nuclear devices to explode the meteor and thus render it harmless. All the rest of the film is filler leading up to this foregone conclusion.To say that the film is ridiculous scientifically is a massive understatement. I could go on and on and on about these aspects of the film. But you can still make or enjoy a film that makes no sense IF the writing is good and the filmmakers are able to make it seem realistic. This didn't happen in this film...mostly because the writing was atrocious. These 'astronauts' are the biggest group of quirky misfits you could imagine...and this totally took me out of the plot. Had they found professional acting folks who were like real human beings and not ridiculous caricatures, then it might have worked....but the whole lot of them were just dumb....terribly written and dumb. I cannot believe that Disney spent THIS MUCH money to make a film but only spent about .00000004% of the budget on writing!!The fact this film won four Oscars doesn't bother me. These were all technical Oscars and the film LOOKS impressive....and I am sure a ton of the huge budget went for this. But what bothers me is that the movie made a ton of money...showing that if you market a film hard enough (and the studio spent more to advertise this than the cost of many films) folks will flock to it like lemmings.Overall, worth seeing for the action sequences....if you can wade through the bad writing that goes along with it. But as one of the cast says in the film, ""Oh god, does it suck up here!"".Oh, and Angelo also recommended ""The Bucket List"", which I saw just before ""Armageddon""....and he's one for two, as ""The Bucket List"" was amazing! So, he's not always wrong!!!",Armageddon
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Not a masterpiece, but good fun besides",7,6 June 2010,"There are things wrong with Armageddon, but I don't think it is a bad movie. In fact I think it more as a guilty pleasure. It is shallow in the character development, the film is much too long by twenty minutes not helped by the sappy love-story subplot and Ben Affleck got on my nerves. With its faults it is entertaining, and I do think it is better than Pearl Harbor, which had amazing spectacle but was bloated and had an awful script. So what makes Armageddon entertaining? Well, the visuals are incredible, and the music is great. I liked the script, clichéd it may be but there was enough tongue-in-cheek for me to be entertained by, and the film realises it's a parody and that it is politically incorrect something those talentless hacks Friedberg and Seltzer should have already learnt by now. The direction is decent, and the acting was good, Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Will Patton and Steve Buschemi coming off best. Overall, no masterpiece by all means, but it is not Michael Bay's worst movie and definitely not the worst movie ever. 7/10 for the entertainment value and the visuals alone. Bethany Cox",Armageddon
2,Leofwine_draca,An effects-laden Hollywood blockbuster that works,6,8 July 2015,"Another big-budget brainless blockbuster film, this bombastic offering is surprisingly enjoyable. Definitely the more entertaining of the two asteroid films released in '98 (the other being the more intelligent, but rather stodgy DEEP IMPACT), this kicks off with an effects-laden opening which shows a shower of meteorites hitting New York and demolishing/blowing up just about everything in sight.Of course, it has to go downhill from there, and some characterisation mixed with lame comedy filler follow for a short while. Thankfully things soon pick up with the exciting space mission and the two and a half hour running time literally flies by. There are lots of dollops of sickly sentimentalising thrown into the mix too, for good measure, but these aren't dwelt on, thankfully enough. Thankfully the producers realised that they were catering for a primarily male audience and made the film a macho testosterone-pounder instead. And it's a good one!This film's style is to have loads and loads of quick exciting scenes edited together really fast so the action keeps cutting from place to place. While this is fine occasionally, for two and a half hours it becomes a bit overdone and tiring but thankfully I didn't notice too much. A lavish score adds to the pace and for once the special effects aren't the star of the show; I think this is why this film was a success, because it's about people more than it is about the latest in CGI technology. Sure, there are lots and lots of (good) computer effects but these only serve as a backdrop to the characters in the story.A good cast also help to smooth over any cracks in the film and it becomes easy to forgive. A baldy Bruce Willis is the hard-bitten hero who predictably enough gets to save the planet, I liked his performance but he showed he was capable of much more than the one-dimensional hero in THE SIXTH SENSE. Billy Bob Thornton (so good as Jacob in A SIMPLE PLAN) gets to emote and look extremely stressed as the poor guy stuck on the ground while Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler supply the sentimental dross which I could have done without. An ever-amusing Steve Buscemi lends the comic angle as the astronaut suffering from ""space dementia"" while familiar faces like Owen Wilson (THE HAUNTING), William Fichter (imagine a young Christopher Walken), Michael Clarke Duncan (THE GREEN MILE), Jason Isaacs (EVENT HORIZON) and Keith David (THE THING) fill out the welcome supporting cast. Even Peter Stormare (the thug from FARGO) appears as an overacting Russian! Extra fun comes from guessing who dies next and the action doesn't disappoint either with plenty of tense moments. Armageddon is not exactly intelligent entertainment but it's a fun, easy to view film with the budget all on screen and with plenty of laughs and thrills along the way. You can't say fairer than that!",Armageddon
3,SnoopyStyle,It's loud. It's stupid. It's Michael Bay.,4,13 December 2014,"The earth is bombarded by asteroids. NASA manager Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) has to come up with a way to avoid a human ending event. They come up with a scheme to blow up the asteroid from the inside. Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) is the best deep core driller. His best worker A.J. Frost (Ben Affleck) is secretly dating his daughter Grace (Liv Tyler). Along with the rest of the crew, Harry has to ride the shuttle, drill down on the asteroid and place a nuke.It's loud. It's stupid. The jokes are lame half of the time. The other half is funny because I'm laughing at how broad they are. The cuts are deliberately violent. It's cartoon testosterone overload. It's relentless. That's Michael Bay for you. If he could pull back, this would be quite a fun ride. Its relentless nature wears me out. And why does a few feet matter when they have nukes? Why are people not in zero gravity when they're in the space station? These and many other things just add to the ridiculousness of the movie.",Armageddon
4,gavin6942,One of Those Guilty Pleasures,7,13 June 2017,"After discovering that an asteroid the size of Texas is going to impact Earth in less than a month, NASA recruits a misfit team of deep core drillers to save the planet.The real mystery surrounding this film is how it got released by the Criterion Collection. Both this film and Michael Bay's ""The Rock"" received the Criterion treatment at one time. And while both are very enjoyable films, do they really belong with Criterion? I feel that by merely being released by them, there is an added importance stamped on the film.But as far as guilty pleasures go, this is a fun and entertaining film. I could do without the romance angle, but the idea of blowing up an asteroid before it hits earth (which assumes a lot of questionable science) is just classic science fiction, here given more legitimacy and budget than ever before.",Armageddon
5,lee_eisenberg,"Considering that in summer, 1998, there were two movies about things on a collision course with earth, COULDN'T WE HAVE JUST STUCK WITH THE INTERESTING ONE?",1,19 March 2006,"One of the most ironic scenes in ""Armageddon"" is when a dog starts tearing at a ""Godzilla"" doll. True, everyone hated the American version of ""Godzilla"" (released a month and a half before ""Armageddon""), but that scene almost implied that ""Armageddon"" was going to be totally different from the former. Well, guess what? IT WASN'T ANY DIFFERENT!!!!!!! It was just another ""Independence Day"": kick-ass Americans risk their own lives to save the world, with the help of excessive CGI. ""Deep Impact"", released two months before ""Armageddon"" and also about a space object on a collision course with earth, actually had a plot - but let's face it: considering that this movie starred Bruce Willis, should we have really expected a plot? At the end of summer, 1998, Rolling Stone magazine declared this movie the ""dumbest scum-sucking corporate product""; I couldn't have said it better myself.As for the rest of the cast, they're all doing their best, but there's nothing to work with. Steve Buscemi is actually the coolest person in the movie (well, duh). They could have done without that whole thing between Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler. If the movie has any redeeming qualities, it's that it gave Owen Wilson and Michael Clarke Duncan early roles. Also starring Billy Bob Thornton and Peter Stormare.Yes, it was depressing that this awfulness had to appear on the silver screen, but hope is not lost: director Michael Bay followed it up with ""Pearl Harbor"", which proved to be a real embarrassment for him and everyone involved in it. Sometimes, I wish that an asteroid would crash down on the people who make these kinds of movies.",Armageddon
6,jboothmillard,Armageddon,6,20 June 2005,"This asteroid movie was released only two and a half months after Deep Impact, which did well with critics and audiences, but apparently this one made more money, directed by Michael Bay (Bad Boys, The Rock, Pearl Harbor). Basically the Earth was hit by an asteroid millions of years ago, and it will happen again, it is just a question of when? After a series of small meteor strikes in New York, NASA are shocked to discover a meteor the size of Texas is hurtling towards the planet, and will hit in just over a month! NASA scientists, led by Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton), plan to drill into the core of the rock, trigger a thermonuclear detonation, and break it into two pieces that will safely pass Earth. The original plan was to have professional oil driller Harry S. Stamper (Bruce Willis) train a group of astronauts to use the drilling equipment, but he sees the only way to complete the mission is to volunteer himself, and bring his crew with him. Stamper's crew consists of Charles 'Chick' Chapple (Will Patton), Rockhound (Steve Buscemi), Oscar Choice (Owen Wilson), J. Otis 'Bear' Kurleen (The Green Mile's Michael Clarke Duncan), and A.J. Frost (Ben Affleck), who is in love with Stamper's daughter Grace (Liv Tyler). The plan is for two rockets to refuel on a Russian space station, then sligshot around the moon, coming up behind the meteor, landing on it as central as possible, and drilling at least 800ft to plant the nuclear weapon. After all the astronaut training, the motley oil-drilling gang, joined by professional astronaut Colonel Willie Sharp (William Fichtner), take off, they manage to refuel at the space station, but disaster strikes when a fire breaks out, its sole cosmonaut Lev Andropov (Peter Stormare) helps them evacuate. It gets tense for NASA when they lose communication for a few moments when the rocket goes behind the moon, but it manages to successfully sligshot around it. But then the debris coming from behind the meteor causes problems, one of the two rockets is badly damaged and crashes, while the other just about lands without trouble. Stamper's crew in the landed rocket start the drilling operation, the other half of the crew, including Frost, have survived the crash landing and start to travel back to the others. The meteor atmosphere causes many problems, with one or two crew members being killed by various incidents, and communication with NASA going awry, but Stamper is relieved when Frost and the others return to help. The surviving crew members successfully drill 800ft, but after an earlier mishap, the triggering device for the weapon has been damaged, meaning that someone will have to stay behind to trigger the blast. After drawing straws, Frost is the unlucky person that will stay behind, but Stamper escoring him grabs the trigger himself, and manipulates his way to take it, he is willing to sacrifice himself, he wants Frost to be happy and marry his daughter. The rocket blasts off, and Stamper detonates the nuclear weapon just in time before the blast would devastate Earth, and the rock has successfully broken into two pieces that pass Earth, and in the end, Grace and Frost get married. Also starring Keith David as General Kimsey, Jason Isaacs as Dr. Ronald Quincy, Chris Ellis as Flight Director Walter Clark and Udo Kier as Psychologist, with opening narration by Charlton Heston. This movie seems to be more about star power, special effects and thing going wrong, you could argue it is more style over substance, I agree the love story element is a little dumb, and the concept of drillers becoming the ones that save the world is a bit inconceivable, but it is certainly exciting, and the Oscar nominated ""I Don't Want To Miss a Thing"" by Aerosmith (lead singer Steven Tyler is Liv Tyler's father) is a great song, a worthwhile science-fiction disaster action adventure. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Sound Effects Editing, Best Visual Effects and Best Sound. Good!",Armageddon
7,moonspinner55,Incredible special effects unleash moments of eerie beauty...,5,28 June 2007,"Well-produced action-thriller about an asteroid the size of Texas about to slam into Earth is unfortunately filled with idiots and dolts. Why do we need Steve Buscemi on board as a loose cannon who manages to sit still for the training but nearly screws everything up in space (and even worse, appears to be rewarded as a ""hero"" besides?). Ben Affleck is his usual wooden, shallow self, but I was able to forget about him. Liv Tyler has some gutsy moments near the end, but her love scene with the animal crackers has to be an absolute cinematic low-point. Bruce Willis? He does his macho act, and there are bits and pieces where you can see genuine emotion registering on his face, but any actor could have played this role--it doesn't utilize his personality to any particular advantage. The special effects are fantastic, and the herky-jerky editing is always careful to reveal just enough of a particular marvel and then move on, but the story is pretty much a wash-out. ** from ****",Armageddon
8,dbdumonteil,"so as Def Leppard said ""armageddon it!"" (the movie)",1,5 January 2003,"Two movies: ""the fifth element"", ""armageddon"". The same subject: to save the world. The same main actor: Bruce Willis. One difference: ""Armageddon"" is very inferior to Luc Besson's film. Some spectacular special effects don't succeed in hiding a labored and globally conventional screenplay. Several parts of the movie are showing it. I think about the president's speech and especially Willis' relationship with his daughter, ""Grace"". At the beginning of the movie, he tends to neglect and overprotect her and this makes her weary. Then, at the end of the movie, it's true love and understanding that shine in him. On another hand, the movie falls in the following trap: Michael Bay takes his subject too seriously. Of course, the movie tries to be funny but the result doesn't work as the humor introduced in the movie is often crude and pretty low-level whereas in the ""fifth element"", the humor was zany, involuntary and enabled to overlook the serious side of the action. The movie suffers from two other handicaps: it often falls into the ridiculous (the Russian astronaut) and almost all the actors are bad used. Bruce Willis is all the contrary of his ""fifth element""'s character. He plays the he-man, he hams it up and sometimes, he's unbearable. The other actors are barely credible in their own roles, particularly, Willis' sinking crew. It seems that this crew is here just for having fun. One of them is taken for being very qualified but he looks like a fool. And poor Liv Tyler! She's at the NASA just to be decorative.When the movie was released in France in August 1998, Bruce Willis expressed is weariness of saving the world. His weariness was probably justified by this spectacular but poor movie.",Armageddon
9,Quinoa1984,how time changes things,3,5 May 2000,"I'm looking back at this review I wrote back when I seemed to not know any better, and I guess its one of those times as a movie critic your position HAS to change. When I first saw Armageddon, I liked it, I liked its energy and its sense of humor, and the kind of Michael Bay style theatricality that went with it. That was when I was 14. Since then I've seen the film a couple more times, and each time I saw it again I wondered how I could've given such high marks to a film that is really of low quality. Armageddon is popcorn entertainment incarnate, but it brings more of the lesser qualities than the better- cheesy, overwrought acting style (could someone please tell Ben Affleck to never cry again?), over-stylized special effects, and a sense of humor that is always the same- a little weak and PG-13 predictable in the guise of wit. There's romance, but its never as long as one might like. The ground control scenes with Thornton, maybe at times the only bits of good in the film, are also weak and over-produced. I guess as I get older and see more films stuff like this just isn't as entertaining anymore.",Armageddon
10,michaelRokeefe,When NASA gets desperate; who do they call?,6,14 November 2000,"Action packed, nail biting thriller. A huge Texas sized asteroid is on course for a collision with earth. NASA, in a last ditch plan, calls on an oil drilling crew to become astronauts, land on the big ass rock, and blow the hurtling menace into so many pieces it couldn't destroy earth. Who else, but Bruce Willis, could play the arrogant, wise cracking leader of drilling misfits? Willis and crew are a little reluctant, but are not about to back down and let earth meet its doom.Great special effects. Great sound effects. Very good soundtrack that features ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing"". Pretty corny script, but in all...one hell of a movie. You will not be embarrassed if seen watching it more than once. This is all pulled off with a diverse and talented cast featuring: Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Michael Clarke Duncan, Jessica Steen and Steve Buscemi.",Armageddon

12,hitchcockthelegend,It's Bayhem time again.,8,25 April 2009,"An asteroid the size of Texas is heading towards Earth, the consequence if it hits is a global killer, the end of mankind. In spite of the billions invested in the space programme, NASA has no answers other than the notion that the asteroid will need to be nuked, from the inside. Enter Harry Stamper and his rough and rugged crew of deep core drillers. Can NASA get these men up on the asteroid and do the job? The fate of mankind rests with a bunch of odd balls!Perhaps because I have a particular kink for the disaster picture, I find it hard to understand the hate for Armageddon. I am after all a man who gleefully defends The Towering Inferno et al with staunch defiance. Armageddon does exactly what was expected from it, ridiculous high octane entertainment with laughs, peril and obligatory chest thumping bravado. All of course cloaked in director Michael Bay's gleeful insistence on blowing things up with devilish panache. Sure there are some twee moments, sure there is some less than great acting on show, but you know what? It's a disaster picture for Michael Bay's crying out loud sake. Check the brain at the door, turn the sound and colour systems up, enjoy the effects on offer and singalong to Aeromith's smashing, ""I Don't Want To Miss A Thing"".Armageddon, does exactly what it says on the cover, don't take it so serious folks. 8/10",Armageddon
13,Theo Robertson,I've Seen Razor Commercials With More Depth,3,6 January 2005,"Looking through the IMDb trivia section I see that Ben Affleck can up with the conclusion that it might be easier training astronauts to be drillers rather than training drillers to be astronauts , but then was told to shut up after pointing this out to the producers . Hey I thought this too and I'm sure that everyone who hated this dumb movie thought the same . When the cleverest person on the set is Ben Affleck you know the movie is heading for disaster . That's just one aspect that's wrong with the script , there's plenty of more like the sketchy and clichéd characters , the scientific blunders and the unrealistic scenario - A bunch of redneck oil drillers attempt to save the earth by travelling to an asteroid , just think about that for a moment and see how the concept quickly collapses But it's Michael Bay's directing that's the major problem . It really is amazing and not in a good way with the camera locking on to characters when they're not doing anything , and too many slow motion sequences during undramatic moments , then when the action does start to hot up the camera intercuts between the action scenes far too quickly . This problem of Bay's style isn't as bad as the director's latter PEARL HARBOR ( But could Bay direct a worse film than PEARL HARBOR ? ) but it is very evident here . And seeing as I've criticised the script for it's lack of science much of the problem is down to Bay as much as the screenwriters . What fireballs on an asteroid with no atmosphere ? There are two things that Armageddon deserves credit for 1 ) The special effects are very good 2) It makes DEEP IMPACT look like a masterpiece in comparison But you do get the impression from watching this film Michael Bay would be better suited directing commercials for macho products like razors and aftershave . I much preferred the weepy , sentimental soap opera antics of DEEP IMPACT",Armageddon
14,preppy-3,I agree that this film is stupid but I was entertained,7,22 July 2009,"After some silly opening narration by Charlton Heston the story starts. According to this an asteroid the size of Texas is going to hit the Earth in 13 days. If it hits it will destroy the entire planet. (I know I know--just go with it) So NASA (led by a slumming Bily Bob Thornton) hires a group of oil drillers (led by Bruce Willis), trains them how to work in outer space, sets them off to drill a hole in the asteroid, set explosives and get the hell out of there...all in 11 days. Also, before the asteroid hits, meteors are coming down and virtually wiping out major cities like New York and Shanghai.As you can see logic disappears pretty quick in this one. Director Michael Bay has said he makes movies for teenage boys. That's no surprise. There's LOTS of explosions here, lots of masculine men fighting each other and a plot dumbed down so anyone can understand it. There's also a hysterically funny ""love"" story between Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler (their goodbye scene using Animal Crackers has become a classic of bad cinema). Despite all this the movie WAS a huge hit. I saw it in a theatre back in 1998. It was a ridiculously stupid movie but I'd be lying if I said I wasn't entertained. It pounds you into submission with some incredible widescreen imagery, LOUD stereo sound and some truly unbelievable special effects. After a while you ignore the stupid story and just sort of go with it. As for characterizations--well who needs that? All of the actors are playing walking, talking clichés. There's not one person that acts like a normal human being. Liv Tyler tries but the script is stacked against her. Also I LOVE how she's allowed to casually stroll around the top secret NASA facility while her father and boyfriend are on the mission! The acting is as good as it can be. Willis delivers his regular one note performance; Thornton doesn't take this seriously for a moment; Tyler tries; Affleck looks lost and Steve Buscemi, Owen Wilson, Will Patton and Michael Clarke Duncan basically hit their marks and say their lines. So this movie is big, loud, stupid and far too long but it WAS entertaining. Just turn off your mind, sit back and watch things blow up. I give it a 7.",Armageddon
15,LeonLouisRicci,Fun Thrill Ride...Everything is Overdone for a Hedonsitic Overdose,8,27 January 2017,"One of the most Hated Fun Movies in History. Every Critic, in Fear of being seen as DUMB, Blasted this Thing into Oblivion. Even those that succumbed to the Ordinary and gave it Reluctant Faint Praise, predictably Included other Not so Kind Remarks, just to Justify.Director Michael Bay's Style has Never Once, Never Ever, No Way No How, been Determined Subtle, and He is Routinely Accused of being Loud, Incoherent, Numbing, Dumb, Over the Top, Over Indulgent, Talent-Less, and........The List of Derogatory is Endless.OK...Moving On to ""Armageddon"".

16,Boba_Fett1138,Very entertaining,8,25 November 2002,"Armageddon is one of the most entertaining movies I've ever seen. If you are looking for a movie with character development, a good story line, good acting, realism and emotions you probably shouldn't watch this movie.The story is very simple: ""An asteroid the size of Texas is on collision course with Earth. In order to prevent this disaster from happening NASA sends in the best oil-driller on Earth Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) and his team to drill an hole in the asteroid so they can blow him up from the inside."" It's obvious the movie isn't meant to be a serious one...it's clear the makers wanted purely to entertain the viewer and in that they didn't failed.Armageddon is a non-stop action movie with great special effects that doesn't get boring for a single second mainly because the pace of the movie is very high. Every single character is entertaining in it's own way and pure fun to watch, especially the Steve Buscemi character Rockhound is more then great.I highly recommend this movie to everyone that want to watch a great non-serious entertaining movie. Just sit back, relax and watch the movie.8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Armageddon
17,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Barely managed to sit through this mess of special effects and general lack of anything else,5,14 July 2004,"After just barely sitting through this film, I can say with almost 100% certainty that I will never even glimpse at one minute of this film, if I can avoid it. The film has a fair amount of explosions and what I imagine is expensive special effects, but generally lacks anything else. The film has little to no character development, which pretty much puts the main characters in two major groups: those who will survive, and those who won't(mind you, none of these will we care about, no matter if they die or not). The little character development there actually is, consists of cliches and various badly recycled formulas for character development scenes. What's worse(well, almost, anyway) is that the characters themselves are cardboard cutouts, cliches, and stereotypes of the worst possible kind; believe me, you'll cringe, you'll feel bad for the actors, hell, you might even laugh, but probably not at the right times. Which brings me to my next point; the humor all feels so forced, and most of the actors share zero on-screen chemistry, which just makes it look awkward and unfunny. The film also has far too much of what is supposed to be humor, which just feels extremely misplaced in what was supposed to be an action/disaster flick(I guess, but it's so messed up that it's very hard to tell). One of the things that really baffles me, is the way the characters are introduced; from the very moment Bruce Willis appeared on screen, I hated his character(you'll find out why when you see it yourself). The same goes for Ben Affleck, and pretty much the rest of the cast. Even Steve Buscemi was someone I had hostile feelings against, even though he did do a fairly good job, and did have some funny lines, scattered about in this film. Liv Tyler offered a few extenuating qualities, mostly by being darn attractive(if you don't mind me saying so) and fairly talented in her performance. The plot is close to being completely incoherent, and lacks any real structure or pace. The acting is good enough, I guess, but is ruined beyond repair by the cliche characters. The humor is mostly unbearably stupid and juvenile, but Buscemi had a few moments and good lines. The special effects are decent enough, but mainly consist of stuff blowing up, which seems fairly unimaginative. The first hour or so of this film is almost bearable, but then the film tries to be serious(it pretty much only starts trying to be serious at this point) and then the quality of the film drastically declines until the point where the film almost becomes completely unbearable to watch, mostly due to the characters cliche-like qualities, which the film suddenly ignores, obviously in an attempt to flesh out these characters, which it fails horribly in, since they are, in fact, cliches, and absolutely nothing more. The film is overly long and pointless. I can(obviously) not really say anything positive about it, since I really didn't find anything about it to meet even my very lowest expectations. If you ever find yourself watching this, do yourself a favor, and either turn it off, or fast-forward to the next interesting scene(which could take quite a while). Nothing unmissable in this feature, sorry. I recommend this only to huge fans of one or more of the following: disaster flicks, Bruce Willis, Steve Buscemi, Ben Affleck or Liv Tyler. Otherwise I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone, as it is really *that* bad. I reluctantly gave this film a 5/10, mainly for actually having one or two scenes that are decent, and for having decent enough effects. Also, Liv Tyler is a bit easy on the eyes, which I guess played a more or less small part in my rating, too.",Armageddon
18,view_and_review,What? The planet is in peril? You don't say!,3,28 May 2008,"I'm sorry.... Armageddon sucked!! How does it suck, let me count the ways. An asteroid hurtling towards Earth, yet another doomsday movie. Of course we need to stop the asteroid or the entire planet will be destroyed, or at least America anyway (because most cataclysmic events happen to America). In order to stop this asteroid we need to blow it up, in order to blow it up we have to drill holes in it to plant explosives. OooKaaay!? So lets fly to the asteroid, plant the explosives and blow this mother lover up. Who better to do this job than oil well drillers? So of course they make it to the asteroid and there is heroism, accidents, self-sacrifice, and of course victory... blah blah blah wake me when it's over.",Armageddon
19,neil-476,Get out that popcorn,7,9 January 2013,"One of two more or less simultaneous movies about saving the earth from disaster by meteor strike by means of heroic space shuttle crews blasting the thing to bits (there's another one of those amazing Hollywood coincidences), Armageddon adopts the space option as opposed to Deep Impact's emphasis on domestic drama. Having said that, Armageddon also factors in a rather limp love sub-plot between Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler.This thing has a great cast, vast amounts of eye candy (in terms of decent effects), non-stop action powering the thing along, Bruce Willis doing what Bruce Willis does best, a complete disregard for many of the laws of physics, and a desperate need for its audience to park their brains in neutral, break out the popcorn, and enjoy the ride.I enjoyed the ride!",Armageddon
20,evanston_dad,Would an Asteroid Actually Hitting the Earth Stop the Production of Films Like This?,3,22 June 2010,"1998 was a bad year for the Earth's relationship with asteroids. ""Deep Impact"" saw one create a tidal wave that wiped out New York City, while ""Armageddon"" had one the size of Texas hurtling toward our planet.But never fear, because Bruce Willis is on the case. He and a bunch of jokey man's men head off to stop it, and of course they're successful, because if they weren't, we wouldn't be able to see Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck swap tongue at the movie's end to the strains of a maudlin Aerosmith song.""Armageddon"" is proof (if further proof was needed) that special effects alone are never enough to make a movie tolerable.Grade: D+",Armageddon
21,anaconda-40658,Armageddon This Stupid Film!,1,16 July 2015,"Armageddon (1998): Dir: Michael Bay / Cast: Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Billy Bob Thornton, Will Patton: Disaster film presents lots of explosions, tumbling skyscrapers, and hurling cars with a plot retread of Deep Impact. What it doesn't present is one good reason to sit through it. The all too familiar premise regards a meteor heading towards earth. That's right. Where else would he hurl too? Bruce Willis heads a team that would be no more suitable for a Kool Aid commercial let alone a trip to Mars. They launch into space and perform a drilling task. Director Michael Bay basically creates noise. His previous film The Rock is also a noise case but at least it is entertaining. This film is about as entertaining as setting oneself on fire and rolling around in gasoline. This is one of the worst performances out of Bruce Willis who goes from attempting to gun down her daughter's boyfriend to shedding tears with him when he decides to sacrifice himself. Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler do unquestionable things with animal crackers although it never occurs to them to eat them. Billy Bob Thorton should fire his agent for his flat role. It is as if he wandered onto the wrong set and was requested to help a film that is beyond help. Will Patton even got dragged in on this explosive diarrhea of a film. The effects are the ticket yet the film should be smashed with several rocks. Score: 1 / 10",Armageddon
22,HotToastyRag,Great cast with tons of energy,7,8 July 2019,"Believe it or not, I managed to escape the 1990s without sitting through Armageddon. I'm notoriously squeamish about ""we're all going to die!"" movies, so the only reason I did sit through it was because it was Bruce Willis's week on Hot Toasty Rag. Thankfully, my mom prepped me for it and told me everything that happened so I wouldn't be too scared or sad. So, if you're squeamish like me, and you want to watch it anyway, just ask your mom how it ends.He must have been busy, or didn't want to seem old enough to have a twenty-year-old daughter, but the leading role Bruce Willis took on seemed tailor-made for Kevin Costner. Bruce held his own and wound up making a certain scene one of the most iconic scenes to come out of the '90s. He plays a gruff, tough oil driller with a soft spot for his daughter, Liv Tyler. Liv, raised around gruff, tough friends of her dad, has fallen in love with one of them, and her dad's not happy about it. Liv and Ben Affleck's romance seems a little unimportant when Bruce and his entire crew are called to NASA to save the world.Sure, I'm not a fan of the premise of the movie-a giant asteroid heading for Earth isn't my idea of a good time-but the cast is so delightful it makes everything worth it. Everyone has tons of energy and brings their own presence to the screen. Bruce had his classic combination of machoism mixed with being a softie on the inside. His fellow drillers-turned-astronauts are an eclectic group impossible to dislike. Steve Buscemi has a weakness for women, and his antics are hilarious and remarkably charming. Will Patton has a broken homelife, and he's given a touching scene the night before the rescue mission to reconcile with his family. Michael Clarke Duncan, Owen Wilson, and Ken Campbell aren't really given anything to do besides rattle off one-liners, but the one-liners are funny, so I don't think anyone will complain. Back at NASA, the head of the program and mission is Billy Bob Thornton, and he always brings a little something special to his roles. Keith David, a head honcho from Washington, brings tension and severity to the plot, and Jason Isaacs plays a scientist with good intentions.When Bruce's group is brought to NASA, they have to go through a mini-boot camp to make sure they're physically able to undergo the mission. It's a very funny sequence, started by William Fichtner, who plays the only certified astronaut on the mission, quipping, ""Talk about the wrong stuff!"" when he sees the odd lineup. Bill has a great, meaty role, and he's completely believable as a disciplined, intelligent patriot who's scared yet confident. Peter Stormare puts on yet another accent, Russian this time, and plays a quirky astronaut who's been stationed in space for too long at the expense of his social skills. There are plenty of comic reliefs in this movie, Peter included, to even out the immense tension of the plot. Even though you'll be worrying about the end of the world, you'll be laughing through your fear.Since this is a Michael Bay movie, you can expect overactive camera angles and tons of special effects. The opening sequence is incredible, even when watching it twenty years later, as a meteor shower destroys New York City. There's a lot to appreciate in this movie, with the push and pull of the characters, everyone's special quirks and motivations, and the Oscar-nominated song, ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing."" The romance between Liv and Ben is really the only downside; it's supposed to be true love and more powerful than the end of the Earth, but it feels like a summer fling between two teenagers. Liv is given many tearjerker scenes throughout the movie, and since she was only twenty years old during the filming, I decided to cut her some slack. I remember the difficulties of being a young actress and how sometimes the emotions you think are being projected in front of the camera don't end up coming across very well. So, when you watch her scenes and she's supposed to be crying over the danger her boyfriend and father are in, keep her age in mind and be kind.To call yourself a true '90s kid, you'll probably want to rent this movie. You'll probably have a good cry during the credits, but if you like these ""we're all going to die!"" movies, you'll probably enjoy yourself during the process. Go ahead and bring your Kleenexes, and enjoy what this very large cast brings to the screen.DLM Warning: If you suffer from vertigo or dizzy spells, like my mom does, this movie will not be your friend. Since I counted 66 spinning camera shots and 13 canted angles, as well as 4 scenes with strobelights and 6 scenes with a severe shaky camera, you should be aware that this movie could make you seriously sick. In other words, ""Don't Look, Mom!""Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However, since this is an ""end of the world"" movie, I'd wait until my kids were a little older until they watch it.",Armageddon
23,FlashCallahan,I haven't thrown up in an hour.......,7,7 January 2011,"A huge Comet is headed for earth. As it does not consist of one big piece, but of a cloud of rather small pieces plus a main rock the size of Texas, little impacts are recorded long before the big one is scheduled for collision with earth. Harry S. Stamper and his drill team are selected to land on the main comet as they are the only ones who can work the special drill Harry developed. Their mission is to drill 800 ft. into the comet to place a nuclear explosive device. The explosion of the bomb will break the comet in two, and the two pieces will pass earth on both sides. This task has to be accomplished before a certain ""dead"" line, or the comet parts will not fly by, but hit earth....It's a return to form for the disaster movie, as we get a kooky cast, Michael Bay, Bruckhiemer, Willis, and a big comet hurtling toward earth, what could possibly go wrong.Well apart from the many plot holes as deep as the hole that gets drilled, there is nothing wrong at all. True, many people will scoff if you say you love this film, but thats because it got a little mauled by the critics.Whats not to love? this is about Stamper trying to hold his 'family' together at an hour of need, and act as the solid oak everyone can rely on, it's not just about saving the world.Willsi has to convince his 'family' that this is something they have to do, as well as swallowing his pride and asking his daughters boyfriend to help to (he see's Afflecks character as a younger self, therefore not really liking his daughter dating him).It's witty and has some wonderful lines, and although it's crammed full of cheese, the soppy ending seems relevant for a film that does cheese, action and laughs by the numbers.It's the cheese on toast of cinema, it's simple, good, but you know too much is bad for you.A simple to follow guilty pleasure, and a feel-good one at that.Ignore the snobs and watch this, you know you love it..",Armageddon
24,movieman_kev,Solid brainless popcorn flick,7,3 July 2005,"Bruce Willis is Harry Stamper, the best oil driller in the world. He's called on by NASA to drill on an asteroid that is on a collision course with Earth. Harry brings his rag-tag team of oil drillers along for the voyage and they have just a handful of days to train to become astronauts (because training astronauts to become drillers would have been to ridiculous, I guess). There's a sub-plot involving Ben Affleck being in love with Harry's daughter, but it's groan-inducing (the 'animal crackers' scene being one of the most horrid ones involving Mr. Affleck ever). But face it the star of the film is the asteroid itself, as it's a blockbuster. Shut your brain off, munch the popcorn and ooh and ahh at the special effects if you must. Just don't look for anything deeper and you'll be fine.My Grade: C+ Criterion 2-disc DVD Extras: Disc 1) Director's Cut; Commentary by Jerry Bruckheimer, Michael Bay, Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck; Second Commentary by Cinematographer John Schwartzman, NASA consultant Dr. Joe Allen and asteroid consultant Ivan Bekey Disc 2) Gag reel; Deleted Scenes compilation; Storyboards; Production design drawings; Analysis of the special effects; Production designer Michael White Interview; ""I don't want to miss a thing"" music video by Areosmith; Interviews with band members of Areosmith; 3 TV spots( 15 second, 30 second & Superbowl); and Teaser & Theatrical trailers",Armageddon
25,Wuchakk,"First, there was ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" and then...",8,15 December 2012,"...""Armageddon.""Lol, okay maybe it suffers from too much modern blockbuster syndrome, but I couldn't help thinking that 1998's ""Armageddon"" was the 1990's ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" I visualize the sci-fi progression something like this:1968: ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" 1979: ""Star Trek: The Motion Picture"" (which towers alone in the Trek franchise -- a profoundly spiritual TRIUMPH) 1986: ""Aliens"" 1998: ""Armageddon""Some might object that I omitted ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" (1977), but it really doesn't fit the list. Don't get me wrong, it's good for what it is, but it's just too kid-oriented.In any event, I hated ""Armageddon"" in the late 90s and never cared to see it again. My dislike was a combination of the whole ""blockbuster"" syndrome with its fast-editing to please those with ADHD approach and, believe it or not, Roger Ebert's scathing denouncement, which illustrates the power of words.Well over a decade later I picked up a copy earlier this year (super-cheap) and finally viewed it a couple nights ago. Wow, was I entertained! Despite my dislike of fast-editing techniques, the story pulled me in right away and held me to the end. Yeah, some of the melodrama is too much, like Willis' scene with his daughter (Liv Tyler) near the end (rolling my eyes), but the filmmakers actually put some depth into the story and it mixes well with the action and humor. Their best move was to focus on character so that we knew and identified (with) the many individuals before the last hour's non-stop suspense and action kicked-in.Speaking of the humor, there are some laugh-out-loud lines, like the one on not paying taxes, ever.Furthermore, the star-studded cast is great and I especially appreciated the inclusion of Keith David and Michael Clarke Duncan (RIP).The film is rather long at 2 hours and 31 minutes (the DC adds two additional minutes), but the story maintains your attention and the suspense, action and F/X are literally senses-shattering.FINAL WORD: Yeah, it's a shameless, over-the-top ""blockbuster,"" but it tries so hard to entertain that you can't help but respect it. Besides, in addition to the disasters, action and humor, there's some actual depth to the characters and story. Take, for instance, Willis' character stumbling upon Affleck and Tyler during an intimate moment where Affleck literally covers her with kisses while she just eats it up. Willis stops, looks, and reconsiders his stubborn position. Then you know why he does what he does at the end.GRADE: B+ or A-",Armageddon
26,Aaron1375,"Cool, action, sci-fi movie.",8,28 February 2003,"This movie would have a higher score if it weren't for very anal people who have to downgrade every movie that isn't an Oscar caliber picture.  These people also listen to critics and basically mimic what the critics say in their reviews.  This movie isn't meant to be serious, it is a nice fun movie where you can just relax and turn your brain off for a bit.  Not all movies have to be deep and make you think...in fact it takes a lot less time and energy to make all those great movies than it does for the summer blockbusters.  If I want to think hard and be challenged, I will read a book thank you very much, movies to me are an escape and should be an enjoyable experience.  This movie was that for me.  The story an asteroid is heading toward earth and the only way to stop it is to drill it and put a nuke in it.  Does this sound like award winning material...no, but it is fun to watch.  The cast is great and they seem to be having fun making this movie as well.  The only scene I could have done without is the animal cracker scene.  That was for the ladies, just like the special effects finale in Deep Impact was for the guys.  All in all it is an enjoyable movie as long as you are not a super serious person who listens to what the critics have to say.  Don't expect to be enlightened, just expect a nice escape.

That's something. But it is his patented sensory assault; between the dizzying cuts and the restless camera, this must be what a coke binge feels like.4/10 While we're on the subject, how did they arrive at Aerosmith for the radio tie-in?

29,StevePulaski,The only film I can think of that should come with an Ibuprofen and a watch with a purchase of the DVD,1,6 June 2013,"I regard the quality of Michael Bay's Armageddon with great sorrow but regard its enormous box office revenue with an even greater amount of depression. Has the magic of cinema been reduced to utter mindlessness that is devoid of content, meaning, and substance? You could defend the film by saying it's a ""turn your brain off"" film, but what kind of compliment or defense is to that a film? That's like saying it's a requirement to be stupid before watching it in order to enjoy the picture simply on an entertainment level.Armageddon doesn't deserve that defense or any others. It's a terrible picture but in many ways does it embody everything that is wrong with American cinema as a whole. Racism, contrived emotions, overblown instances of peril, noisy, muddled sequences, hammy relationships, stupid characters, and patriotic, flag-waving nonsense thrown in for good measure. You look at a picture like this and wonder why we look like a slew of amateurs in terms of tonality and originality when compared with other world cinemas.The story concerns the fact that an asteroid the size of Texas is on its way to earth, and NASA scientist Dan Truman (Billy-Bob Thornton) has a plan to bury a nuclear device deep inside the asteroid that will break the asteroid into two separate chunks and miss earth. You'd need Bill O'Reilly, Neil DeGrasse Tyson, and a slew of other journalists and astrophysicists to explain that kind of certainty. Desperate to find those that could pull off an operation like this successfully, NASA contacts Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis), one of the best deep-sea oil driller in the world, for advice and assistance in staging the operation. Harry, however, has his own problems like keeping his adult-daughter Grace (Liv Tyler) away from her new boyfriend, who happens to be A.J. Frost (Ben Affleck), one of Harry's younger, more irresponsible drillers.Long-story short, he chooses to accept the mission and takes his crew of utter misfits along with him to assist him in these efforts. Among them is the overly-sensitive and sometimes violent Michael Clarke Duncan, the insane Steve Buscemi, the sophisticated prodigy Owen Wilson, the irresponsible A.J., and others. I don't care how desperate NASA would be in this certain time and I don't care how willing and confident Harry and his crew would be, nobody would send this crew into space under any given circumstance. The thought is truly baffling that the fate of the U.S. essentially rests in a man's crew who can't solve a simple problem without shouting or arguing.But leave logic at the door, since that's what we're supposed to do and look at the film's aesthetics, content, and quality. This is an incredibly boring picture, disgustingly overlong, horrendously underwritten and underdeveloped, and unspeakably redundant. By the umpteenth explosion around the fifty minutes mark, I was ready to wave the white flag. How loud does a popcorn movie have to be before we get the point? How screamingly obvious does every explosion need to be that it had the mass, density, and magnitude to level buildings, burn infrastructures, and send the camera spiraling into a dizzying frenzy? Michael Bay knows how to make every scene into a spectacle, which is why he has garnered praise and criticism. Some can appreciate it craft as a valuable addition into cinema. I see it as an emphasis on fast food filmmaking, or in other words, filmmaking that has the power to make us demand less story-wise but crave everything action-wise. I'd call these films dangerous to the public because it stops the desire and hunger for creativity and encourages settling on the bare fundamentals of film. In a culture already so easily amused by reality TV and sheer stupidity, it is films like Armageddon we need to uniformly ignore.And if it weren't the explosions being the driving-force the film's badness, it's the abundance of music and emotion to manipulate and tell you exactly how you're supposed to react and feel towards every setup in the film. Between the soundtrack of Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, and Journey giving us the exact feeling we're supposed to possess and the incidents that practically flash what mood we're supposed to feel on the screen, Armageddon offers no room even for audience reactions outside of the norm. If you ever wanted to watch a film and want to be in touch with the mood of the film so much so that you don't even want to process the information being shown to you than this is for you.Armageddon, despite featuring one-hundred and fifty minutes of sensory annihilation in the way of sound and visuals, is one of the most boring films I've seen in years. Inert, lackadaisical, overblown, and lacking in creativity and interpretation, it has gone on to be embraced only by those who could stomach such a degrading endeavor. This is the only film I can think of that should come with an Ibuprofen and a watch with a purchase of the DVD.Starring: Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck, Steve Buscemi, Michael Clarke Duncan, Will Patton, and Keith David.

Why does he have to cry in all of his roles? It's irritating. ""Armagedden"" promises a lot, but doesn't deliver it's title. Usually, you'd expect this huge and great movie. The special effects are the only thing that could get you into the movie. The acting was below average and the story is pretty bad. Bruce Willis was always great with his roles, but even he couldn't save this movie. The ending was beyond cheesey.

31,sddavis63,At Best A Bad Joke,2,25 March 2007,"Where does one begin with this movie, except to say that it's very bad. Let's begin with some of the more obvious things. First, it's hard to believe that with all of today's available technology an asteroid large enough to destroy the world could be found only 18 days before it hits! But let's assume for a moment that it's true. NASA decides that the only way to stop this from happening is to send people with drilling experience to the asteroid to implant explosives to blow the thing up. Well, maybe, but then we have to take seriously the proposition that the only people in the world who could do this are the rather motley crew assembled. We then have to believe that in less than 18 days (they have to be assembled from all over the world and then they have to fly to the asteroid, which would surely take 2 or 3 days anyway) they can be trained first to deal with space flight and then to actually work on the surface of this asteroid (surely drilling on an asteroid is a little different than drilling on earth?) It kind of makes a mockery of the whole astronaut training program doesn't it? Completely over the top performances from everyone involved make this movie cartoonish. Complete with the requisite love story between Grace and A.J.

33,Robert_duder,Another Bruce Willis classic action...always one of my favorites since the day I saw it for the first time,9,6 May 2007,"It was July 1st, 1998...Canada's Day for those of us who are Canadian. I skipped the fireworks and decided to rush out to see the new Bruce Willis movie entitled Armageddon and that day brought me one of my favorite movies to date even 10 years later. I caught it again recently expectantly while on vacation on TV and was impressed all over again. An ensemble cast that makes the film funny, edge of your seat action, huge special effects, amazing director and production and even a terrific story line amidst a rather predictable plot that had been done before and has been done since in one way or another. Many write how much they hate Armageddon but at well over 300 million dollars grossed and even some Oscar Nominations for effects and sound and such...somebody loved it and I was one of them. I have even read some who called Armageddon campy and I can't agree with that at all. Top notch special effects, and a huge budget ensured that even the wildest plot seemed feasible and real. You were strapped to your seat the minute they left the planet right onto that asteroid and then all the way back to Earth. It was the thrill ride of the decade.Bruce Willis led the cast of slightly unknowns at the time as world class oil driller Harry S. Stamper who lives his life on his oil rig along with his now grown daughter Grace. Willis plays this character to a ""T"". Some would say it's his 'usual' character but in this case Harry Stamper is the usual Willis. He's macho, and oozing testosterone and the brighter of the group and he's a concerned father and a determined driller. He's a self made man and won't let anyone tell him how to do things. Willis is a powerhouse on screen. He was at his finest. Liv Tyler is Willis' daughter Grace and doesn't get a lot of screen time compared to some of the other cast members but she still does well showing the emotion and playing the romantic lead opposite Ben Affleck. Affleck plays young, head strong and very stubborn A.J. Frost who is in love with Stamper's daughter much to his dismay. Affleck and Willis butt heads on numerous issues but in the end are like father and son. They have great chemistry together and even the romance between Affleck and Tyler which is like a sub-sub-story works well and really adds to the plot. The supporting cast is just about brilliant and really jump started some careers...Billy Bob Thorton plays NASA administrator heading up this mission from the ground Dan Truman. Although the role is a little small he still manages to make the best of it and really give an emotional performance. Will Patton is terrific as estranged father and husband ready to be a hero 'Chick' Chapple, Steve Buscemi is good and important but a little over zealous as the woman hungry and a little deranged 'Rockhound.' Owen Wilson is pretty good as the cowboy Oscar Choi who gets some humorous one liners but I'm still not sure what his purpose in the mission was. Michael Clarke Duncan is terrific as the heavy lifter and operator 'Bear' Kurleenbear, Peter Stormare practically steals the show as stranded and reluctant cosmonaut Lev Andropov. And William Fichtner (who seems to pop up in various character roles) plays the lead NASA Astronaut on board Colonel William Sharp who butts heads with Willis on numerous occasions and holds his own against him.Michael Bay is no stranger to action films and definitely has his own wild style when it comes to directing and producing. He directed amazing action flicks like Bad Boys, Armageddon, Pearl Harbor and The Island (which I liked!!) and is bringing to life the Transformers this summer. His gritty realism in the face of what otherwise would be the unbelievable makes him a master of this genre. He can make you believe anything and then take you on a wild ride as though you were sitting right there with them. Armageddon is the type of movie where when the ball gets rolling you could stand with your jaw dropped and not move until the credits role because the action is literally non stop and it's almost stressful to watch everything unfold one scene after the next. If somehow you haven't seen Armageddon you're missing out on one of the most fantastic disaster, action epics of the last decade. Please I insist you see this one because you'll enjoy every minute of it and it doesn't disappoint fans anywhere!! 9/10",Armageddon
34,g-bodyl,So much better than expected!,10,12 April 2008,"I must say that Armageddon is the best movie of 1998! The film has mind-blowing special effects, tons of humor, and great sci-fi action. In the movie, a NASA director discovered that the Earth had 18 days before it's demolished by an asteroid. He and his colleagues trains a group of oil drillers for space only in a few days. Then the director played by Billy Bob Thornton sends the team to the asteroid and they must place a nuclear warhead in the meteor or else. I don't know why there's negative hype about the film, but I enjoyed it a lot. The all-star cast led by Bruce Willis, Thornton, and Ben Affleck was just amazing.

36,CuriosityKilledShawn,The Mountain of Assembly,8,21 February 1999,"The summer of 1998 was mostly unremarkable, with the majority of films failing to impress. The overblown Godzilla was a humongous letdown, as was Armageddon's rival Deep Impact. Armageddon came out champ of the summer season (along with Saving Private Ryan, Lethal Weapon 4, and There's Something About Mary). But none of these films managed to push past $217 million, which would be absolutely unthinkable now, inflation or not.Despite the relatively low box office returns (just a smidgen over $200 million), the marketing machine for Armageddon was in our faces everywhere, and I feared it might burn-out audiences before release. I know I felt a little cynical when I went into the cinema that day, my expectations very low.I've said before that Michael Bay does himself no favors. The man knows how to make a blockbuster, but he's utterly clueless when it comes to making a good film. Armageddon is the only film in his entire resume that I find watchable and entertaining, though he still should have held back some scenes (the notorious animal cracker love scene really should have been dropped).A big boulder of iron ferite hurtles through space, knocking smaller meteors toward Earth (thinking of breaking a frame on a pool table). NASA recruits immature oil driller Harry Tasker and his band of roughnecks to go into space and nuke the comet before it ends all life our little blue planet. With an 18-day countdown it's going to be very, very close.Although it took a total of 18 writers to staple the screenplay together, Armageddon succeeds in almost every area where Deep Impact failed, plus more. The soap opera is kept to a minimum while the action is ramped up, delivering one hair's-breadth escape after another, all to the sound of Trevor Rabin's amazing score, which the life blood of the movie. The huge cast of fine actors, the SFX, and the action would all be significantly inferior without Rabin's soaring tunes, which turn many of the key scenes into wordless music videos of visual storytelling.That's not to say that the acting isn't notable. As a matter of fact, Bruce Willis is surprisingly effective, as is Will Patton, who rarely gets a decent role in mainstream movies. Though, as with Con Air a year before, Steve Buscemi owns every scene he's in (tying with Peter Stormare). Just ignore the horribly miscast Ben Affleck whenever he appears. He's the only real weak link of the movie, to the point where you ought to switch off during his screen-time.As the only truly exciting blockbuster of the 1998 summer season, Armageddon defines a lackluster year, and elevates Michael Bay's classless resume. It's exciting, colorful entertainment, and none-the-worse for it.",Armageddon

39,tabuno,"Big Budget Action, Adventure Blockbuster",7,13 January 2019,"24 May 2016. Weathering the release of Deep Impact two months earlier, Armageddon relies on its bigger budget, bigger explosions, and bigger intense build-up of non-stop crises, and larger than life predictable entertainment to overcome a slow start to outperform Deep Impact. This big action adventure relies on a scripted pattern of hanging by your seat mini-episodes loaded with exaggerated humor, superhero outcomes, and light-hearted banter, especially from wacked out Steve Buscemi. This action fantasy is almost pure entertainment with the requisite love interest, the human sacrifices, and the frantic mission controller. This movie pushes all the audience buttons, moves at a whithering fast pace, and glorifies the Russian stereotypes to an almost embarrassing degree.",Armageddon
40,The-Sarkologist,Bruce Willis saves the world - again,8,2 October 2011,"Armegeddon is defined in the movie as being the time in which the world ends. In the bible it is the name of a final battle where the world rises up against God and God fights back and wins. It is described as being a blood bath where blood is ankle deep. The reason it is called Armegeddon is because it is fought on the plain of Megiddo which, as one of my friends says, is a pretty good place for a battle. The movie, on the other hand, is a little like Deep Impact. I say a little because it seriously romps all over the former movie. Deep Impact came out first but after seeing Armegeddon you wonder why anybody would actually want to see Deep Impact. This is a much more well thought out movie with a singular plot and a lot of excitement. Deep Impact opens with a car crash and a government cover up and the period of excitement is watching a huge wave wipe out the east coast. Armegeddon opens with the destruction of the world and then goes straight into a meteorite shower striking New York city. They first think it is nukes but realise that they have a whopping great big asteroid coming towards them and they have only 18 days to prepare for it. Thus they find Stamper (Bruce Willis), the world's best oil-rig driller, and ask him to help them with the machinery to drill into the asteroid. He ends up taking his crew into space to drill into the asteroid. The movie is very entertaining with much more laughs than Deep Impact. The characters are a little light hearted and we can appreciate the jovial manner. Then there is the asteroid itself: it is a very fearsome thing that has a very Gothic feel  to it. It is mostly shrouded in darkness and it seems to be alive as his attempts to stop the miners from destroying it. We know that it is not alive, but the problems that are continually mounting upon it create a situation of utter urgency. There is no end to the excitement in the movie, and the fact that a huge shower of meteorites is heading for the earth gives way for much more destruction than Deep Impact. Armegeddon is about the end of the Earth, but we all know that the world will be saved, we know from the beginning that they are going to destroy the asteroid. That is inevitable. What we watch the movie for is to see how we get to that spot. The psychology of the movie is what is interesting. There are fears that an asteroid will come our way and there is no way we can stop it, not with out technology. There is a fear in the populace that something like that will happen so what we have are movies that reassure us that no matter what happens, we can overcome such difficulties. A scientist theorised that such a thing could happen so everybody panics. We are sheeps and will believe anything that we are told, and we are being told that we have the power to stop the end of the world. The truth is we cannot. When Christ returns only those of us who follow him will be saved, all other will have to face his wrath. Thus Armegeddon is a good movie but puts false hopes in us.",Armageddon

43,paulclaassen,Thought-provoking action disaster drama.,7,6 March 2021,"Love him or hate him (I love him!), Michael Bay can be considered the Master of Disaster - and I mean this as a complement! His destruction scenes are incredibly well done (think the Transformers movies, Pearl Harbor, The Rock, 13 Hours, 6 Underground, etc.) The New York meteor shower scenes were fantastic!!The film features great performances from a veteran cast, and the visuals are amazing. As with most of Michael Bay's movies, there's a lot of humor to break the seriousness of any situation. I generally don't approve of this method, but at least in 'Armageddon' it never becomes slapstick or overbearing, although maybe way too many one-liners from Rockhound (Steve Buscemi).The humor ceases almost entirely during the last hour, as the suspense intensifies significantly. 'Armageddon' is a heroic tale of unlikely heroes. The film certainly begs the question: What if? As they remind us in the opening sequence, it happened before, so it could happen again. Yes, I believe it could. Will we be prepared, and what would our solution be? This is a great script and an incredible motion picture!",Armageddon

The interpretations of both Bruce Willis who played as Harry S. Stamper and Ben Affleck who played as A. J. Frost were very good. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Billy Bob Thornton who played as Dan Truman, Steve Buscemi who played as Rockhound and Liv Tyler who played as Grace Stamper.

47,Dr_Coulardeau,This film leads us to mental archeology,8,4 November 2007,"The film opens with the twin towers standing proud and tall in New York City. We are in 1998. The US had not yet been the victim of that deep fit of terror fright which is just as frightening as space fright. It was a time when the US were already deeply obsessed by the end of the world (as always and ever in their short history), and since the USSR did not exist any more, and China was not yet seen as the new contender, they were exploring the danger from outer space anew. They could accept the idea of more or less showing a few Moslem pictures along with dominant Christian ones. The strict separation of religions had not yet reached Hollywood. The enemy that the US mind needs to be able to think the proper way was a big piece of rock coming from far far away in space and the size of Texas, read my lips of course. But why do the US always think the world as having to come to an end and why envisaging this end as having to be a fight, even against a piece of rock? If the world has to have an end, and it sure has to because nothing is eternal, why not prepare for death that may occur any time? If humanity has to have an end too and it will have an end since it had a beginning, why not just getting ready to meet that end in dignity? Why always see that end as a catastrophe? What's more why do the US always end at once thinking of themselves as the saviors of the world as soon as they speak of that end? The world will have to come of age and be able one day to face its future, no matter what, in other terms than a savior and a mass of repenting and grateful individuals? But the film is a lot more interesting when seen ten years after its shooting. The world can be saved by the human race itself. Good. We had not reached the great paranoia of climate change yet. To save the world one individual will have to sacrifice himself for it and that one is the father and not the son. That is a complete inversion of the Christian myth. But even better, in fact worse, that savior, that redeemer, that self-sacrificial person is a man, as if women were not yet of age for that kind of selfless sacrifice. But note that father has a daughter and there is no mother anywhere. Is it a sign of our times when families are broken up everywhere? Or is it a sign of the superiority of men, though there is another divorced couple with a son and the son is taken care of by his mother (inverted situation). So where is the real truth about this question? I personally have the impression that the film is ten years old and that in Hollywood they could ten years ago still produce such films that are definitely slightly male chauvinistic with just a light, very light touch of female liberation if not only female presence to avoid any gay ambiguity. Slightly passé, and also a little bit long as for the scenes on the meteorite.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",Armageddon
48,Floated2,"Loud, silly and overly long",4,10 December 2020,"After watching Armageddon for the first time, this Michael Bay film was as expected. It was a box office success and one of Bay's biggest earliest hits but was critical panned by critics- and for relatively good reason.It has all the stereotypes and cliches we come to expect from a Michael Bay film. A lot of his films tend to have that sort of fun, silly, over the top cartoonish and nostalgic type atmosphere. It was hard to take serious given all the comic relief and silly moments used. The tone reminded of the Transformers films.The film isn't completely terrible but isn't great either. There are some fun moments but the film is quite long and does drag at parts. It starts off quite slow as it introduces things but does get better in the ending. It does have quite a solid and thrilling finale.Can see as to why many people consider this a ""guilty pleasure"" film (mainly given people not wanting to admit enjoying Michael Bay films).",Armageddon
49,filipemanuelneto,Lack of logic and American propaganda destroyed this movie,3,25 April 2016,"What would happen if our planet were suddenly threatened by the imminent collapse with an asteroid? Was humanity prepared to stop it or destroy it? This disaster film talks about it. Directed by Michael Bay, it has a screenplay by Jonathan Hensleigh, J.J. Abrams and other contributors, and has Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler in the lead roles.We are facing one of the most famous disaster films made by the American film industry, a machine that is always ready to find new ways to destroy the planet. But in this film which was more damaged was the movie itself! Let's begin by the actors: Willis is excellent in action movies and is always ready to save the day since ""Die Hard"". His interpretation is good and the same can be said of most of the actors. But the script could have been much better. The idea of ​​using a nuclear bomb to split an asteroid and alter it's trajectory is simply not realistic or plausible enough since that bombs aren't stronger enough to do that. Even less plausible is the idea of ​​equipping amateurs, without any training or some previous trip to space, with multi-million dollar equipment and use them as a last hope of Humanity. This is a joke that only some minds in Hollywood could imagine and an attack against the intelligence of any viewer who has a minimum of logical sense. The illogical disaster that this film is, however, turns out to be softened by the love story between A.J. and Grace, moving like any other where the lovers are separated against their will. Some of the film's scenes are mere U.S. propaganda: the asteroid pieces have reached all except the U.S. (was that a minor problem?), who saves the day as usual, with great waves of American patriotism. The Russian space station, old and obsolete as a museum, is destroyed in the process, as well as it's single cosmonaut, who seems constantly drenched in vodka and has an absurd accent in an insulting stereotype to the Russians. Is this a remnant of the rivalry between the two countries?While Bruce Willis is the great hero of this film, this is a film that was destroyed by two asteroids: the lack of logic of it's script and story and the American desire to do patriotic propaganda. ""We saved the world. Russia, France and China may have gone to hell but the rest is fine thanks to us"". Hollywood still didn't understand that the U.S.A. can be rich but they aren't the policemen of the world.",Armageddon

Director Micahel Bay does a decent job with this disaster/end of the world flick, but let's be honest here. This is no great film. It has lots of action, weird, one-dimensional characters quipping humourless one-liners, and a plot with little gravity toward any kind of reality. It is a very entertaining film yet does not compel like something like Independence Day or The Day After Tomorrow. I even enjoyed The Core more(no pun intended). Willis gives his action hero performance of little depth and Ben Affleck - well, the less said the better. Liv Tyler is nothing more than scenery, and the rest of the cast is pretty much one stereotypical character after another: the guy on the bike, the annoying man who talks all the time, etc... The guys playing these roles are fun to a degree. I enjoyed seeing Owen Wilson, Michael Clarke Duncan, Steve Buschemi, and all the rest. But none of them are real at all. The only performer I actually thought brought a little credibility to his role was Billy Bob Thornton as a head at Nasa who had a leg infirmity not allowing him to go on the mission. Bay does have some wonderful special effects of cities being destroyed and the meteor itself is quite impressive. And the ending - though coming right at you straight on does have some poignancy to it and at the same time a bit of ridiculousness as well.

When I first saw it, I was blown away. I loved every second of it! It was exciting, it was spectacularly done, the acting was great, the dialogue was funny, I couldn't think of a single thing wrong with it. Obviously, I bought it on video. Then I watched it at home, and saw for the first time what an awful movie it is. Armageddon manipulates the emotions of the audience like no other disaster movie ever has. The romantic scenes (like those in The Rock) are clumsily and randomly thrown in (this way it will appeal to women, too, and therefore make more money in the box office). The tough guy acting, particularly (and CONSTANTLY) on the part of Bruce Willis as Harry Stamper, the world's best oil driller, was terrible! There were so many scenes in this film that were thrown in for no other reason than to get a meaningless laugh or broaden the target audience that it began to get tiring trying to figure out which ones actually had anything to do with the story itself. Besides all that, there were also horrible discrepancies in the storyline. Early in the film, Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) describes the effects of the asteroid collision as ""basically the worst parts of the Bible."" Even the name of the film, ""Armageddon,"" is taken straight from the Bible. Given that, you have to wonder why there are so many times when the characters (mostly Stamper and Truman) ask God for help, ask God for just a little more time, pray that ""God be with them."" Why are they asking God for help?! They just finished pointing out that it was God that sent the asteroid! Why WOULD He help? You can see how the hypocrisy of religion even manages to wiggle its way into Hollywood films.The dialogue of the movie also took a lot away from several of the action packed scenes. The phrase ""She's gonna blow!"" is uttered so many times that by the time the scene's climax is reached it has no effect anymore. The predictability of the ending is also a serious disappointment. Furthermore, the logical errors were a little disturbing. For example, there was moderate WIND on the asteroid, as well as clouds of dust and smoke floating calmly around. That's funny, I thought we were in SPACE traveling at 22,000 mph.As a whole, Armageddon is an edge of your seat action thriller, but there wasn't a whole lot of effort put into it beyond special effects and sheer financial purging. It's never boring, but the structural, logical, and storyline problems take away a great deal from what could have been a spectacular disaster film.",Armageddon

The movie is perhaps one of the finest films of the past twenty years. The title is "" Armageddon "" which is synonymous with the end of the world. It's appropriate as this film purports to show what would happen if a gigantic size asteroid were to strike the earth. The story concerns the fate of the planet and what the earth's brightest men would do to save it. Concluding the best way to stop the rock in outer space, a brilliant research scientist Dr. Ronald Quincy (Jason Isaacs) devises a plan. The best drillers in the world are recruited to fly into outer space, land on the traveling asteroid, drill 800 feet into it's surface, plant a nuclear bomb and split it in half. The man requested is Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) and he is told by Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) the director of NASA that he has been selected to save the planet. Reluctantly, Stamper agrees but insists on taking his own crew which includes Ben Affleck, Will Patton, Steve Buscemi as Rockhound, Owen Wilson and Michael Clarke Duncan as 'Bear.' The special effects in the movie are incredible as is the top notch acting by Peter Stormare as Lev Andropov the Russian Cosmonaut and Keith David as General Kimsey.

57,freemantle_uk,Bayham Disaster Movie,4,8 June 2009,"Like most of Michael Bay's film they are a lot of problems with this film, being too long, bombastic, overly edited, has poor acting and dialogue and very right wing. Armageddon is one Bay's poorer films.The premise is simple, an asteroid the size of Texas is about to crash into Earth in 18 days. They has been a meteoroid shower destroys a NASA space shuttle and causes destruction in New York City. NASA and the American does not revile the fact that the asteroid was going to crash into the Earth. NASA also believe that a nuclear strike would not destroy the asteroid, so decide that they need a team to go onto the rock and drill a Nuclear bomb into it and destroy it that way. No NASA team is trained to do it, so NASA controller Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) tries to recruit Harry Stumper (Bruce Willis), an oil driller who has a reputation for drilling in tough environment. He agrees to help but only if he could use his own team.The plot is complete rubbish. It's easy to poke holes into it, such as surely wouldn't NASA notice an asteroid the size of Texas much earlier? Why not just train a team of astronauts to do the drilling (Ben Affleck pointed that one out)? Why such an complex and expensive plan? Why not just get America and Russia to fire every missile they could at the rock? The film also breaks the laws of physics at many points. Such examples are how could a Space Shuttle land on a asteroid and how could an asteroid have Earth like gravity?Armageddon follows the two maxims of disaster movies; first America is great and second, what ever can go wrong will go wrong. This happens all the time in the film, such as the Russian space station blowing up, a space shuttle getting destroyed, one of the drilling missions flowing off into space, the other space shuttle nearly can't take off and it goes up to the last second before the bomb blows up. Also it shows its America that saves the world, that the Russians and even the Chinese are backwards, gives the shuttles the names Freedom and Independence.The biggest surprise to me is that J.J. Abrams co-wrote the script and he is a man who brought the world Alias, Mission Impossible III and the new Star Trek film. The film is too long, and drags very quickly. The film is also trying to be funny and most of the time the jokes fall flat.As a director who is most of the time derided anyway, Michael Bay does a really poor job here. He cuts too much so you can't see what's happening and they are many continuity errors. Such examples are when A.J. (Ben Affleck) is shot and changes which leg is shot and when the French Bulldog attacks Godzilla, from toy models to a giant balloon: a poor editing job there.The acting is hit and miss. Bruce Willis tries his best, but it's not his best work. Liv Tyler was hit and miss. Ben Affleck is poor as always. Steve Buscemi, Owen Wilson and Michael Clarke Duncan offer comedic relief, at least they have gone on to do better things. The strongest actors were Billy Bob Thornton who is excellent actor and Will Patton, whom character Chick does at least seem to have some depth to him.There are some positives. They are excellent special effects and action sequence, especially when New York suffers the meteoroid shower. The score is good, but can be overbearing at times.At least most of the people involved have done better things afterwards. Michael Bay did the Island and Transformers. Bruce Willis: Sin City, Live Free or Die Hard. Liv Tyler: Lord of the Rings, the Incredible Hulk. Michael Clarke Duncan: Sin City, The Green Mile, etc...It best not to see this film unless you really turn your brain off.",Armageddon
58,dee.reid,"""Armageddon"" rocks!",10,19 June 2004,"Love him or loathe him, you have to give director Michael Bay the thumbs up for the enormous craft and ingenuity that goes into his films. It may be that his films are overblown yet are entertaining, have horrendous yet amusing dialogue, and have wooden yet colorful characters. But you seriously have to ask yourself, what great action movie does not have those qualities? OK, OK, some may not, but we're not talking about other action pictures, we're talking about the films of Michael Bay. Those who say that his films are crap seriously bother me because I have found it extremely difficult to believe that they were not at all entertained when they have paid good money to see his latest action flick.He obviously likes to blow stuff up (see ""Armageddon"" or ""Pearl Harbor"" to see what I mean), but you have to give him the praise that he richly deserves  for that he has an eye for detail, in fact such an eye for detail, that he may just be the best modern action filmmaker alive today. He lavishes in detail and great camera shots of one single frame around a character or object. To make this story short, his films make for captivating, if not necessary viewing for any true action fan. His films are never boring; he keeps dialogue to a minimum and he just keep you entertained for the running time.Bay was an accomplished music video director before scoring his first hit in 1995 with Martin Lawrence and Will Smith in the buddy-cop action film ""Bad Boys,"" and would later re-team with them both for ""Bad Boys 2"" last year. However it wouldn't be until the following year that people really knew who Michael Bay was when he directed the Alcatraz thriller ""The Rock"" with Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage and Ed Harris as the leads.Now we're at ""Armageddon,"" which was released amidst hostile reviews and received quite a tongue lashing from critics in the summer of 1998. Its story about an asteroid (dubbed a ""global killer"" by NASA) and the team of civilian oil drillers who are recruited to land on it and drop a nuke down a hole in its surface took a backseat to some really inventive special effects.Even if you don't buy the story or its characters, you could at least lavish in the special effects and the production. The antagonist of the film, a jagged, almost hellish goliath of a rock that's hurling towards planet Earth at millions of miles per hour, takes a terrifying life of its own once we see its surface. This is where our director Michael Bay comes in. He wants to show us his vision of Hell, which is his vision of this asteroid that's intent on wiping out everything on the planet; this also gives the ""Armageddon"" tagline a little deeper meaning: ""It's closer than you think."" ""Nothing would survive, not even bacteria,"" so says Billy Bob Thornton after briefing Bruce Willis and company at NASA in one of the films early scenes.As Jeanine Basinger, a professor of film studies at Wesleyan University, comments in her review of the film on the Criterion Collection DVD (Bay is a former student of hers), ""Yes, it [Armageddon] gives audiences a lot to absorb. Yes, it cuts quickly from place to place, person to person, event to event. But it is never boring, and never less than a brilliant mixture of what movies are supposed to do: tell a good story, depict characters through active events, invoke an emotional response, and entertain simply and directly, without pretense.""If you are a die-hard action fan (I'm not, though my movie collection would probably suggest otherwise), don't pass up Michael Bay, because in the end, he's just giving the audience what it wants.10/10",Armageddon

And if its nothing more than a bunch of ""jingoistic"" flag waving, why did it make so much money outside of the United States? It doesn't add up.'Armageddon' is corny, it ignores logic and thumbs its nose at the basic laws of physics, but it does so solely to tell a rousing story of cheerful heroics and old fashioned derring-do.

62,barnabyrudge,"Has impressive moments, but insists on being shamelessly corny rather too much of the time.",5,22 December 2004,"""Armageddon"" in its biblical sense refers to the final battle to decide the fate of the world. And this 1998 action movie wastes no time in placing the world in grave danger as an asteroid the size of Texas heads towards the planet, threatening to wipe out life as we know it. Armageddon is undeniably exciting in parts, but it frequently undermines itself with set pieces that are too over-the-top for the film's own good, and some embarrassingly corny dialogue and situations.NASA scientists learn that an asteroid is on collision course with earth. Their only option is to destroy the rock before it hits, but in order to do that they need experienced drillers who can burrow to a depth of 800ft, plant a nuclear bomb in the hole they've made, and blow up the offending asteroid. The only team who have the expertise to carry out the required drilling work are a bunch of misfit oil-drillers led by Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis). The top brass at NASA aren't exactly thrilled at the prospect of placing the fate of the planet in the hands of these unrefined, blue-collar layabouts. But since no-one else can do the job, Stamper and his cronies are put through rigorous space training before being sent to intercept the asteroid and save mankind.Where Armageddon comes unstuck is in its insistence on overcooking its ingredients at almost every possible point. For instance when the heroes dock at the Russian space station to refuel, what's the point of the big action sequence in which the routine refuelling procedure goes wrong and the station ends up blowing up? It's not a genuinely exciting scene - just an artificially contrived sequence shoved in there purely so that the audience can be subjected to more explosions and last-gasp escapes. There are many similarly exaggerated scenes which lose impact due to overkill - Buscemi's bout of space dementia; the dumb scene in which a trio of men drive across a gravity-less canyon; Willis's absurdly noble and polished final speech just minutes after he's elected to sacrifice himself to detonate the bomb; the TV-commercial-style scenes of kids running around with toy space shuttles celebrating the destruction of the asteroid; etc. These scenes really grate on the viewer, because they are overdone to such a degree that they insult our intelligence. That's not to say Armageddon is all bad. It's done with its tongue in its cheek and so manages some occasional flashes of self-deprecating humour. Also, occasional sequences are quite exciting, with good editing and photography, and in a few scenes the action is suitably exciting because it isn't bled dry of all credibility. The performances vary in quality, but Patton is good as one of the drillers and Stormare has a nice role as an eccentric Russian cosmonaut. Armageddon is an OK popcorn picture for the undemanding, but its identically-plotted 1998 rival Deep Impact is unquestionably better.",Armageddon

65,NateWatchesCoolMovies,Haters be damned. I will always love his one.,10,21 November 2015,"I was going to start this review off by saying what a guilty pleasure this flick is for me, but you know what? No. I am unapologetic in my love for Michael Bay's Armageddon. It's a titanic blast of pure adrenaline and emotion, cruising along on that slick, hyper real sensationalist action fever that only Bay can sustain for 3 freaking hours straight. Call the guy what you will, there's just no denying the fact that he has incredible skill in forging spectacle and large scale disaster scenes of heart thumping magnitude. Yes, Armageddon spends some of its time in the cheese drawer, and some of it us flag waving, melodramatic hallmark Bay, but for me thats excusable, when you look at the sheer achievement in sound and fury on display. Not to mention the touching love story (cynics and cinephiles everywhere hate me right now lol). Who doesn't tear up at Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler's scenes. I know I can't look at animal crackers or listen to 'Leaving On A Jet Plane ' without thinking of the two of them. Also, forget about the science or logic with the plot, just sit back, flip the snob switch off and enjoy three blissful hours of popcorn movie enchantment. Bruce Willis is his roughneck self as Harry Stamper, oil drilling prodigy who is drafted by NASA (in the earnest form of Billy Bob Thornton) to fly up and drill a hole in a giant asteroid that's on a collision course with earth and threatening to destroy all mankind. They're to drill the rock, plant a nuke inside it and blow the sucker up. NASA is appalled at the rowdy nature of Harry's crew, and race to get them flight ready in the small window of time they have before the asteroid gets too close. Meanwhile, the world panics and awaits the result of their mission. Harry's crew is a wild bunch of dudes, including hotshot AJ (Affleck), horn dog Rockhound (Steve Buscemi), giant man child Bear (Michael Clarke Duncan, RIP) and Chick (Will Patton, just so moving in scenes with his family). Harry's daughter Grace (Liv Tyler) and AJ fall hopelessly in love and provide a huge emotional core for the story, Tyler in particular gives quite the performance. The scenes on the asteroid have have a sharp, shredding quality as the team navigates a nightmarish rocky terrain, directed by with crisp class and efficiency. The cast is a positively biblically epic lineup of recognizable faces including Keri Russell, Keith David, Jason Isaacs, Grace Zabriskie, Owen Wilson, Udo Kier, Charlton Heston, Eddie Griffin, Peter Stormare as a ridiculous Russian astronaut and William Fichtner in a standing ovation worthy turn as a troubled flight specialist. Anyone who's who a big enough fan of this knows of Arrowsmith's music video of their song 'Don't wanna Miss A Thing' and how it wrenches open tear ducts upon each new viewing. There's also a stirring score by Trevor Rabin that gets me every time.This is a film where you have fun. Not pick apart every artistic detail and complain about all the bombastic overkill. That stuff is half the fun. The film critic/cinephile is a preening, pretentious cat, sitting on a fence and surveying cinema to scoff at movies like this that don't any of their precious subtext or lofty themes. Armageddon is a big, messy golden retriever that runs up and playfully bats the cat right off the fence into a pile of action movies, reminding it what movies were meant for in the first place: entertainment. And in that category, boy does this baby deliver.",Armageddon

The asteroid is said to be the size of Texas, which is overkill. The writing is terrible.
The trouble is that idiots were judging writers long ago, and giving the ""okay"" to those who were not threats, while immediately ousting actual competition. That's the American way of the 1970-present day era. No wonder dialog has gone downhill.
As has empathy. There's really no way to empathize with the characters, particularly the Superman character played by Afleck, and yet we are to believe he has vulnerability when he has never had a rough minute in his life? to the extent most movies do effects. Just slightly abused. There is at least a ridiculous ""movie logic"" and time frame to follow.
I'm quite sure the reason for making the characters and dialog so poor is to cover up the stupidity and contrivance of the plot. And the lack of romance in the relationship with the daughter and Afleck. A total zero in inspiration with the love interests, which is sad, considering how physically beautiful the daughter is.
The effects are well done, not abused. It is watchable. And the woman who plays Bruce's daughter is super hot to look at. It's just depressing that she is in a relationship that has absolutely no romance.",Armageddon

The world is going to end thanks to a giant space rock hurtling towards us. Fortunately, 'Murcia! Is here to save the planet with off shore drillers and nukes and a team of nut jobs. Nothing here makes sense, the science is all over the place, it focuses more on melodrama and Stephen Tyler serenading his daughter as she's about to have sex with Affleck then it does on the actual saving the world on a crazy space mission. All the actors are basically playing their standard roles, which is dull and predictable.I wonder how much movies like this influenced the likes of The Martian. Movies ridiculous fluff and movie nonsense causing a certain someone to write a book about a space adventure and ask the question, ""Hey, what if we actually tried to get it to make sense?"" We also have Michael Bay behind the helm so this is flooded with obnoxious patriotism, juvenile sexuality and immaturity and a lot of LOUD! All that said, it does look pretty, so I'll give him that. It also weirdly fits into that trashy movie sweet spot where it could be an ok throw away watch or a movie to roast with friends.In the end, if you want a trashy action drama to throw on, this works for that, but if you actually pay attention to anything this falls to bits fast. There's so much nonsense, so much Bay. It fits a very niche viewing mood, in my opinion, and if you're not in that zone then this is just garbage, which is where I'm landing on it.

Is its diameter that of Texas north-south, or east-west?  Or is it that the asteroid has the same volume as a sphere with a diameter the same as that of a circle with the same surface area as Texas? That seems to me to be the most charitable reading.This is the kind of inane discussion the characters in ""Armageddon"" might as well be having, for all the concern they show over the imminent end of all life.  They discuss the matter as if they're talking about the annual tax return deadline.  To be honest, I think taxation worries them more than death - which is exactly the mean-spirited attitude you'd expect from a loud, over-edited, the-stupid-shall-inherit-the-Earth Bruckheimer parable. If this were a book, it would be a paperback, it would be sold in newsagents, its title would be in silver letters, and each paragraph would be one sentence long.  Possibly two.One worthwhile thing, though: we get to see what a good actor Bruce Willis is.  Objectively speaking his character is insufferable.  He gets his jollies by whacking golf balls onto the heads of Greenpeace protesters.  His over-the-top protective attitude towards his daughter, while I'm sure it's meant to be cute, is only just this side of perverted.  In short, he's a jerk.  If we nonetheless like him - or at worst, fail to dislike him - this is entirely due to Bruce Willis.  He can make any character charming.  Part of the secret is knowing how much charm too use; too much charm is as bad as too little, and Willis knows never to turn the `charm' knob higher than necessary.  In `Armaggedon', it's set at maximum.",Armageddon

Steve Buscemi plays a ratty little psycho genius who spits out line after line like that, and had me in stitches. This film is a go getter, pedal to the metal, brains set on stun action adventuror flick to the max. Not a documentary; which I would Advise many of you out there to remember when seeing it.Spoilers below! Warning!!!!!! You root for the oil drillers big time, and I personally felt quite bad when 'Deep Blue Hero-stuff' Man was killed in a crash. I think they should have kept Owen Wilson on. His guys seemed to be the one who was actually enjoying himself up there.I thought the shots round the world, showing the reactions in India, Africa, Europe, the US, Turkey, etc. to the explosion above were handled Very well, the music swells and is quite moving to boot.Other things to look for when seeing it-check out Will Patton's little scene with an ex-wife and his son; where he strains to let them know he has regrets, and is going to somehow go away and make up for his past failings...That is a good scene, well handled if somewhat short. I liked it.Bruce Willis is flat in some of his lines but is alright all in all. They could have used more pacing, and slowed up on the break neck MTV style editing that they throw at us for the whole film; there is plenty going on there to enjoy if you look for it, and they didn't need to race through so fast.Having the two killers from Fargo-Buscemi and Leb there again is a hoot; and you will like Leb believe you me. He actually talks in this film!!! Parts they could have done without-the shotgun scenes(are these the same people who we see on the asteroid, one saying 'I love you!!!' with tears streaming down his cheeks? Hmmmm... I would have liked to have gotten a little more light shed on the Freddy Noonan character too-of the drillers, he is the only one they didn't show either getting rounded up by the FBI or talking to the shrink during the testing. Go figger.Minor caveats. This film is great, big fun, much better than Deep Impact, which makes you want to fall asleep half an hour in. There, they stand round waiting for the earth to die. Here, they do something about it. Give me that anyday.Rating ***1/2 outta ****, definitely a must see!",Armageddon
75,Movie-ManDan,A Ton Of Fun! Even if it is no good.,5,3 March 2015,"Armageddon is one of the most recognizable films in all of cinema, but not so much well liked. This is very divided, with very few people claiming the whole movie to be a masterpiece. I liked it. I didn't LOVE it, but you know.This is a blockbuster meant to make money. It is evident that millions of dollars were put into this, hence millions are needed for the movie to be any sort of success. Director, Michael Bay does his first and best super-explosive picture. Bay makes many high-powered explosions just for the heck of it. Starring in this is Bruce Willis along with Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler and Steve Buscemi, all giving subpar performances with awful dialogue. Luckily, the negatives don't last...long.Armageddon is the twin of Deep Impact. Both are about humans preparing for a massive comet heading toward Earth that will cause extinction. While Deep Impact is more serious and accurate, Armageddon is mostly a mess of it. In nicer terms, this is the fun version. The first hour and some takes place on Earth with the preparation and subplots. Early meteors hit and Bruce Willis is angry that his daughter (Tyler) is seeing a handsome coworker (Affleck). There's huge explosions and violence just for fun. The acting is bad too. Everything (almost) is inaccurate and unrealistic. Deep Impact is far better. Even the background music and Aerosmith songs weren't enough to fully brighten up any scenes. But the take-off scene when they head into space is when the movie gains ground. The visual and sound effects are amazing and the set pieces are awesome too. Sadly, them being in space is way too long. Bay abuses his privilege. Good thing the ending is truly good.2/4",Armageddon
76,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,It has acouple problems but nothing anyone will loathe,7,31 May 2015,"Back around the late 1990s, Hollywood started becoming obsessed with making movies about the end of the world. Some of which bordered on the edge of unrealistic while others wanted to really scare the crap out of its audience with what sounded and looked like plausible science. Whether it be shifting plate tectonics like Volcano (1997) or the devil himself in End of Days (1999), someone thought up of some way the world would end. For director Michael Bay, his idea was more patriotic, although perhaps a little too self-righteous. Although the plot of the movie is not mentioned to be in accordance with the Mayan calendar, the way it comes across is pretty much ""the end of the world""-ish. What's more surprising is that Michael Bay finds this to be his worst movie. I think he should check his list again.After NASA discovers a gigantic meteor the size of Texas is headed towards Earth, the head of NASA named Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) orders the recruitment of oil driller Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) to head up to space to knock the ""global killer"" out of orbit. Stamper accepts but only after the rest of his drilling crew comes with him. The rest of the drilling crew contains AJ Frost (Ben Affleck) who's also dating his daughter Grace (Liv Tyler), Chick (Will Patton), Rockhound (Steve Buscemi), Bear (Michael Clarke Duncan), Max (Ken Campbell) and Oscar (Owen Wilson). The supporting cast also includes William Fichtner, Jessica Steen, Peter Stormare, Keith David and Jason Isaacs. Thankfully, for a cast this huge Michael Bay had some credible writers for this production. Penning the official screenplay for this film was none other than Jonathan Hensleigh (Die Hard: With a Vengeance (1995) and Jumanji (1995)) and a young J.J. Abrams. As a whole, the story is proficient at working with what it has. Most of the characters mentioned prior do have a definitive personality and also portray genuine emotion.Then again, there are some moments that hint at the typical Michael Bay shtick that always feels unnecessary. Being that the movie is 2 and a half-hours long, there definitely could have been some trimming on the sides. Some scenes either had no relevance or meaning to the story and did not further the plot. All they did was emphasize how silly some characters can be written. Most likely the running time could have been cut down to 2 hours. The only other part that wasn't needed was the love subplot going on between AJ and Grace. It felt forced and clichéd. Making matters worse was Liv Tyler's acting ability. She wasn't horrible but she had a very stiff face and in some cases she became quite obnoxious portraying her character. Delightfully, there are enough supporting characters to make-up for her. The most interesting belonged to William Fichtner's role as a space astronaut caught between his code by NASA or what his gut says. His exchanges with Bruce Willis are quite the attention grabber.The most entertaining act of the film (and rightfully so) is the final act. It is there that we see Harry Stamper and his crew work as a real team and seeing that happen and how they handle various situations is an intense ride from beginning to end. This also goes pretty much for the cinematography and special effects. All of which blended in nicely as well. The director of photography for this production was John Schwartzman and for what was depicted on screen, it still holds up today. There are large wide panning shots of landscapes but most of it belongs to the meteor, which does look heavy on CGI. Again though, the special effects are something to admire too. For it's time, it could have looked a lot worse but even today it still looks decent.Musically related, the score was composed by Trevor Rabin. Rabin, who's main forte is in the synthetic aspect of film score, does not deviate from what listeners would normally hear. Much of his music contains the same kind of generic electronic keyboard rhythms and action cues. Surprisingly however, Rabin provides a very memorable and emotional power anthem that acts as the movie's main theme. Although there was no Armageddon 2 (and hopefully never will) the fact that Rabin made such a memorable theme for the movie is commendable. It has a very heroic like tune that makes the jobs being done truly feel a difference is being made. As a recommendation for anyone looking to collect Rabin's score, the best would be to go with the bootleg edition. Most of Rabin's score do not contain more material than 30 or so minutes. But the bootleg for Armageddon (1998) is a little over an hour and a half. It's hard to find film scores with such detail so if you can get a hold of it, I suggest you do.Like other Michael Bay films, it has a few areas that needed trimming with unnecessary scenes that make the movie longer than it needed to be. Plus, Liv Tyler's acting is noticeably irritating on screen. Other than that, Bruce Willis and the rest of the supporting cast work well, the music is recognizable and the third act to this sci-fi nail biter is quite a ride.",Armageddon
77,Kamurai25,"""Space Rock: Drill or Die""",6,30 July 2020,"Good watch, might watch again, and can recommend.This has a great premise and stacked cast which is incredibly well balanced not only between the ""diggers"", but the control crew and the astronauts as well. While they take that opportunity use the characters to really build the world, the story really just boils down to ""meteor going to kill earth"" and ""guy and girl connection, but girl's daddy doesn't like"". Surprisingly the latter takes up a significant amount of time in the movie, but everyone gets their moment in the spotlight. Steve Buscemi definitely has some of the most memorable moments in the movie.This is the first movie I can think of that has this sort of detail of space travel, let alone tried to simulate the hellish landscape of an asteroid.

I wish I was old enough to have watched it at the theaters because it would have been a life changing experience. The beauty of this film is was uplifting despite its sad moments.

81,Lady_Targaryen,For Love. For Honor. For Mankind.,8,12 January 2006,"''Armageddon'' is one of the most touching movies I already watched in my life. I don't care if some people think it's too heroic or too easy to predict the end, I loved it and it is one of the fewest movies who made me cry. A big asteroid with the size of Texas is coming to the Earth, and NASA decided to send the best deep core drilling team to space in order to make a chance to us, humans, not get extinguished. Harry S. Stamper (Bruce Willis) is the leader of the team and also the worried father of Grace Stamper(Liv Tyler). Grace and A.J (Ben Affleck),one of the guys who works in Harry's drilling team, loves each other and pretend to marry, but Harry disapproves the relationship and has serious problems with A.J.All the team is being trained to go to Space, and when they are in the asteroid, one of the most beautiful scenes of the movie (with an extra help of the famous aerosmith's song ''what it takes'') happens.This movie is great and all that ''Deep Impact ''wanted to be!",Armageddon
82,mike48128,A guilty pleasure years ahead of its time.,8,7 May 2012,"I would give this movie a 10, but then nobody would believe me. If you want to see a truly bad end-of-the-world disaster movie, go rent ""The Day After"" or ""2012"" (Or one of the those old ""Volcano"" movies.)All recent disaster flicks have outstanding special effects, but the story has to make some sense. I like ID4 but hate the sub-plots. Ditto for ""The Day After"" and ""2012"". A special effects ""popcorn"" movie has to be fun to watch. This one is. The earth destruction scenes work in this one. The disaster camera is not directly aimed at the Eiffel Tower, White House and pyramids (though it comes close). The Army's ""secondary protocol"" is logical. With the magic of DVD, it is possible to shorten this movie to a more watchable 2 hour length by skipping the 1/2 hour training and prep chapters. I believe that all the last-second near-misses are intentional, paying homage to Indiana Jones and James Bond films; and most of the humorous scenes are intentional also. Not so in other ""disaster"" films,including Titanic. So there is about as much ""Techno-Talk"" as the worst Star Trek Movies, and they made several mediocre ones. A bit far-fetched? Sure. Just turn off your brain, make some popcorn, and crank up the sound system!",Armageddon
83,intelearts,My 407th Review: Space Cowboys,5,2 May 2011,"I saw this at the cinema when it came out and watched it again on TV when it comes round - though very good in places the overall effect for this viewer is barely passable. THe film is full of good performances and the comedy is excellent, but somehow the heroic, for this viewer, never gels, so by the end I wasn't truly caught up. I guess the fault lies in the romantic comedy syndrome: if you know he's going to get the girl how do you make the journey worthwhile; same problem here - I never, not for one second, believe that the oil drillers won't succeed.The film is surprisingly by the numbers - with huge effects a crushingly loud soundtrack, and some fun, but all in all, it will never be anything other than a boy's own adventure in space. You know those you don't recognize from the beginning are in trouble, and the one you do will be the heroes, and so on.All in all, barely passable way to turn the brain to porridge; a popcorn summer blockbuster that looks good and delivers just enough.",Armageddon

There were a great deal of laughs too (mostly intentional) anyone who hasn't seen this but just wants relax and enjoy a good (yet Shallow) action flick then this certainly fits the bill.For pure entertainment value i score it 8/10If this is for you then check out The Core and Independence Day, avoid the Day after Tomorrow and Deep Impact, there not really for action fans.",Armageddon
85,MartianOctocretr5,Space pollution,3,30 January 2010,"There's a whole meteor shower full of flicks about rogue rocks dropping in to blast us all in to cosmic talcum powder. Some good, some poor but this space debris ranks as the lousiest. Circumstances are dire: if a meteor impact doesn't kill you, then the movie will bore you to death. Scientists detect a meteor on collision course with Earth, and decide to nuke it in to space rubble. They entrust the nukes and the fate of the Earth to guys with the following qualifications: they blow up stuff at an oil rig or something. They're selfish, reckless, childish, and yell a lot with limited vocabulary skills. Just the kind of winners we need to save the planet from imminent destruction. Rarely has an ensemble cast collectively turned in such abysmal performances. People faced with the prospect of the end of the world, (or saving it) act like they're at a frat party. Willis looks like he's doing a Jackie Chan impression. Affleck appears to be doped up on medication. Billy Bob appears to be suffering amnesia or delusions. As for Buscemi, Wilson, Duncan, and others, they all stink so bad they'd offend a skunk. To be fair, here's the good: decent special effects. Back to the awful: the script. The lines are pitiful. We get the self-sacrifice bit near the end, which is as convincing as a used car dealer's claims. Some of things are lame, like the flying bus nonsense, but the movie can't even make you laugh at its stupidity. That's because it's basically irritating. Most of the people are obnoxious, and their churned out human interest stories don't work. You'll be pulling for the meteor to impact, and obliterate all these fools. If not that, the meteor impact would at least mercifully put you out of your misery.",Armageddon
86,sme_no_densetsu,Not nearly as bad as the critics would have you believe,7,20 March 2013,"These days it's become fashionable to regard any Michael Bay picture with extreme derision, particularly amongst the critical community. However, upon recently rewatching Bay's 1998 blockbuster ""Armageddon"" I am forced to admit that he has indeed directed a few watchable movies.The story here is fairly preposterous but what do you expect from a big-budget disaster movie? In this case, a meteor that could wipe out all of mankind is hurtling toward earth and no-one seems to know what to do about it. However, before long, NASA scientists decide that humanity's best bet is to send a rag-tag team of misfits into space to blow the meteor apart before it's too late.The movie has a fairly hefty 151 minute runtime but I don't really think that it's entirely justified. There are some parts that feel like contrived diversions meant only to superficially create drama or to contribute to characterization. The movie is also guilty of being somewhat maudlin at times and also a bit too overtly patriotic. Nevertheless, over the long haul, the script holds together well enough to retain your interest without straining credulity beyond the breaking point.One big asset for the movie is the loaded cast. Sure, stars Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck & Liv Tyler have all been better elsewhere but the real meat of the cast is in the supporting players. There are some of the best Hollywood character actors here like Billy Bob Thornton, Steve Buscemi, Michael Clarke Duncan, Will Patton, William Fichtner, Peter Stormare & Keith David. The filmmakers even managed to get Charlton Heston for the opening narration. It'd be difficult not to appreciate a cast like that, no matter what kind of material they've got to work with.On the visual side, Michael Bay's direction is well handled but his penchant for quick cuts is in evidence throughout the film. Sometimes this works well but other times it seems superfluous (though it isn't necessarily distracting). The Oscar-nominated special effects have also held up surprisingly well.Musically, the movie's a bit of a mixed bag. On one hand, there's some classic ZZ Top, Aerosmith & Curtis Mayfield but on the other hand there's some Journey, Jon Bon Jovi and, of course, Aerosmith's schmaltzy Dianne Warren-penned smash ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing"". Trevor Rabin's score is pretty solid throughout, though.Ultimately, ""Armageddon"" is a worthwhile big budget spectacle. The storytelling may be a bit clumsy but the movie actually has a fair amount going for it. As far as popcorn entertainment goes, you could certainly do a lot worse than this.",Armageddon
87,Howlin Wolf,The End of Subtlety...,8,29 November 2007,"There are few films that come under more attack from movie elitists than ""Armageddon"". ""It's loud! Boorish! Jingoistic! Empty-headed!"", they sneer contemptuously. All of the naysayers are of course exactly right. It is all of these things and more tactless synonyms besides. If you take every one of these criticisms into account, however, and nevertheless make a conscious effort to approach the film in the right frame of mind, then I still maintain you can have a lot of fun with its blunt attitude.It's an overblown comic-book tailor made for teenagers and grown up kids, alike. Embrace it's sheer ridiculousness; chomp popcorn and grip your seat in synch with the deafening musical cues that are helpfully provided. It's meant to be an assault on your senses and nerves, just like the wildest ride in an amusement park. Logic doesn't enter into the exercise, and nor should it, either. This is a slam-bang experience, and Michael Bay is your consummate purveyor for these types of things. I ask those who would still gripe fruitlessly: What the heck else should you be expecting????!!!Sometimes you have to learn to appreciate 'big and dumb' if it's 'big and dumb' that's at least aiming for mass appeal. This is absolute populist entertainment for better or worse. Try to enjoy it, otherwise you might as well never go outside again, if it offends your delicate sensibilities too much...",Armageddon
88,rivertam26,A cinematic dud,5,18 June 2020,"I wasn't a fan of this when it came out although I was in my pretentious non mainstream phase. Revisiting it I have discovered that my first thoughts on it weren't far off. Despite an exciting and engaging beginning the movie soon becomes a blend of amateur melodrama, bad writing, cliches and hammy performances. I'm sure everyone has seen this by now but just in case it's about a group of miners who are sent up to space to blow up an asteroid before it wipes out earth. Although Liv Tyler eventually became a good actress her performance here leaves something to be desired. There's no chemistry between anyone but it's all quite goofy and messy. I'm actually a fan of Jerry Bruckheimer I enjoy his balls to the walls aesthetic when it comes to making movies but the film is an absolute dud. The only bright spot is a hunky Ben Affleck.5/10",Armageddon
89,Screen_Blitz,A popcorn movie deluxe,9,15 June 2015,"Michael Bay was one of those director I think is criticized too much and deserves more credit for his movies, especially this one. Bruce Willis plays Harry Stamper, a veteran astronaut who is informed by NASA of a Texas-sized asteroid heading towards Earth. In determination of saving mankind, Stamper gathers a group of blue-collar workers to drill a hole through the asteroid and set a nuclear bomb inside to blow up the asteroid before it crashes into Earth. This film features a stellar cast of actors including Ben Affleck, Michael Clarke Duncan, Steve Buscemi, Owen Wilson, Billy Bob Thornton, Willaim Fichtner, Will Patton, Keith David, Peter Stormare, and Liv Tyler. This is one of Michael Bay's most enjoyable films. The plot is compelling and well written, the action scenes are great, and unlike most of Bay's films, this one has heart and emotional resonance. Critics were definitely wrong about this movie.I enjoyed the amazing cast this film features. Bruce Willis does okay as Harry Stamper, the main character, even though his casting is a bit off at various points. Liv Tyler does a great job as Grace, Harry Stamper's daughter who is in a relationship with blue-collar worker A.J Frost (played by Ben Affleck), despite her father's disapproval. The rest of the cast was really funny, cracking hilarious one-liners here and there, especially Steve Buscemi. Some people expressed negativity to this, mostly since the film revolves around the impending destruction of Earth and is supposed to be serious. However, it wasn't bother by the humor, I thought it fit well. Aside from the cast, the action scenes taking place in space were fun to watch. These scenes includes typical eye-popping explosions that Michael Bay is known for, along with great special effects. While there is all the action, humor, and fun that many would enjoy, there is also some emotional scenes towards the climax at left me choked up. Armageddon does have it's flaws.Aside from the occasionally clumsy acting, there is one scene I found a little obnoxious, which is a scene involving Ben Affleck's character singing a corny little love song to Liv Tyler's character. Overall, this movie is very enjoyable. Don't listen to what critics say, I found this film to be entertaining and fun to sit through.",Armageddon
90,dunmore_ego,Arma Hatin' It.,2,11 December 2008,"Imagine the worst pain and suffering ever. That's how it's gonna feel at the end of the world. Coincidentally, you can feel that exact same pain and suffering by watching Michael Bay's Armageddon. Armageddon is a painful exercise in squeezing every cliché possible into 150 minutes of swooping camera moves, slomo shots of blond American farm kids, nauseous flag-waving and the movie's heroes walking abreast towards the camera, with smoke billowing in the background in slow motion. At least twenty times.Armageddon is also about an asteroid (""the size of Texas"") on a collision course with Earth, which only Bruce Willis' team of oil-drillers can destroy, able to perform the requisite deep-core planting of a nuclear device on the asteroid to blow it up. You can't train actual astronauts to do technical stuff like that, no way.While a slightly perverted subplot revolves around Ben Affleck pursuing Willis' daughter, Liv Tyler, a cavalcade of B-stars makes A-holes of themselves in the middle background: Billy Bob Thornton, Steve Buscemi, Michael Clarke Duncan, William Fichtner, Will Patton, Owen Wilson, and trusty Chris Ellis (Deke Slayton in APOLLO 13, and forever cast as Some Guy In Mission Control in all these space films).A movie with less science than STAR WARS (if that's even possible), less physics than MOONRAKER (which had none), less credible operating procedures than CAPRICORN ONE (which faked them), and less street cred than DEEP IMPACT (which preceded this film by two months). And - of course - ripping off Arthur C. Clarke and Isaac Asimov so bluntly and banally, the filmmakers should be roasted over an open spit when they make that big science fiction convention in the sky which Clarke and Asimov preside over.Only one example of the thousands upon thousands of uneducated scenes should convince a viewer what an eye-candy fool's joke Armageddon is: two space shuttles are launched simultaneously - okay, fine - but fifty feet apart? Just seeing them attain low Earth orbit together and jettisoning their Solid Rocket Boosters should give even the most ""unscientific"" bananahead (i.e. the filmmakers) an idea of why this was such a monkeybrain scene - the SRB's are ejected via explosives which propel them away from each vehicle - into the flight path of any other vehicles in their vicinity. Of course, in the film, tragedy is averted by making the CGI SRB's jettison AWAY from the path of the following shuttle. But anyone with common sense will look at this scene and realize what a brainless berk Michael Bay and his writers are for allowing it on screen.CAPRICORN ONE was an uneducated mess, but space movies made before the 90's at least had True Ignorance on their side. The general public only knew so much about orbital mechanics and physics laws. Now there is NO EXCUSE for movies to treat outer space like a thrill ride at Six Flags. We've all seen footage of actual space shuttles in space - so how can Michael Bay's shuttles fly around as if they're in an atmosphere, following NO orbital mechanics, trajectories, or laws of physics. Why is there sound in space? Shouldn't these people have their glare-shields down on EVA in sunlight? We know all this via the very technology these movies flaunt, yet pretend to ignore, in order to serve the asinine plot.Everyone in space shouting at each other like they're actors doing something really hard and important - even though they've all got headset radios; everyone extolling information which should have been imparted in training (""you're about to hit minimal gravity, so you might get nauseous"" - thanks for telling me TWO SECONDS before I hit minimal gravity!); non-sequitur action, like Buscemi picking up a machine gun and firing arbitrarily, simply to cause concern for the characters (which I lost as soon as they started signing Leaving on a Jet Plane like the Oil Riggers Men's Choir), rationalized as ""space sickness."" THIS MOVIE is space sickness.Every scene an epic moment waiting to happen, like Liv Tyler with her hand on a monitor after tearful goodbye to her father in space; camera pulls back and every single monitor in NASA is showing that same transmission - not like they have anything IMPORTANT to monitor, like the incoming space shuttle with a thousand malfunctions represented by all the movie sparks comin' off the consoles. And if the epic shot doesn't happen, Michael Bay jumps on his Chapman crane and MAKES it happen, annoying inspirational music padding the whole exercise.Best line is when William Fichtner describes the other crashed shuttle as being ""off the grid"" and Buscemi retorts, ""Off the grid?! What're you, a freakin' cyborg?!"" One redeeming factor of Armageddon is that it actually delineates what a ""hero"" is - for this society which tags foopball hooligans and people jumping out of buildings and army grunts doing their jobs as ""heroes."" Bruce Willis stays behind to detonate the nuclear bomb. He is a hero because HE HAD THE OPTION NOT TO.The two halves of the asteroid ""miss the Earth by 400 miles"" and around the globe everyone cheers, Chapman crane swooshing in ecstasy, blond American farm kids hugging their parents in slomo - with everyone once again ignoring the physics law that puts those pieces (each half the size of Texas, mind you) in orbit around Earth (unless they're pulled out of orbit by another celestial body), which means, in Earth's future, another flyby, another potential collision...Let's hope next time that ignorant human species is wiped out.",Armageddon
91,KUAlum26,What did my sense of hearing do to offend Michael Bay??,4,15 June 2008,"Or for that matter,ANYONE'S hearing. That was the question that I had from watching this film in the theater almost exactly ten years ago.This movie had the audacity to pick on another fellow summer flick,Godzilla,and while that big-budget Roland Emmerich film was certainly replete with its own over-bloated budget,frenetic special effects and silly dialog,it at least was FUN,never trying to take on any air of seriousness or emotional grand-standing like this film.YOu're probably familiar by now with it. Texas-sized asteroid head for Earth. NASA,in the person of a sober,reasoned chief(Billy Bob Thornton,still hot from his Sling Blade win from two years before)decides instead of using their best and brightest to do the dirty work,enlist the help of ""the best"" team of oil-drillers(led by a sweaty,sardonic Bruce Willis). Of course,as a meteor that size hurtles to Earth,there is,of course,the natural doom that comes with it and this film spares no time in pounding away the gravity of that,with slow moving tracking shots of people all around the world looking to the sky,slow shots of large American flags,slow-mo shots of astronauts and the drill team as they're heading for their capsule(and destiny,it's implied).And of course,pre-requisite romance involving two of the cutest and least interesting characters in the show(played in utter earnest by cute Ben Affleck and pretty Liv Tyler). Wrap it some drippingly earnest Aerosmith music,and you've got ""winner"" stamped all over it.A little aside here:no trade secret here but as this was released about a month after Dreamworks' Deep Impact,it and DI get comparisons to each other. To me,while DI was about as much fun to watch as watching a cancer patient slowly die,I still came away with more respect for that film than this sort of cowboy,""EArth's gonna blow up unless U.S.A. sends their toughest to save the day. YEEEEEEEHAAAAAWW!!!"" film,which,besides being unnecessarily LOUD(which I think was no mistake by the filmmakers to amp the volume of an already noisy film,evidently under the principle that ear-splitting=memorable),the movie also commits the following crimes: science that was written for people who flunked science class in high school(fire and noise in space come to mind instantly);working my favorite element of this film Steve Buscemi as a likable,if sleazy,comic relief for about two-thirds of the film before trying to turn him into a treacherous character toward the end(maybe the reverse of his turn in 1997's Con Air); practically wasting Owen Wilson and character actor Will Patton in the flush to keep the cameras steady on Willis,Tyler and Affleck;not making up its mind whether it wanted to be a brainless-but-enjoyable summer action flick,a patriotic type thriller or a semi-comedic buddy-to-the-third-power flick.Another reviewer said that how DI and A differed was a matter of tastes,that people who appreciated thoughtful,more realistic dramas would appreciate DI,while action-lovers would go for A. Perhaps so,but I happen to enjoy a good brainless action figure like the next male,and I STILL found myself angry after this film. Perhaps it was mostly about my hearing that made me steamed,but that should account for something where your film enjoyment goes,right?",Armageddon
92,Maciste_Brother,Cinematic Armageddon,1,28 October 2003,"I can't say often enough how bad ARMAGEDDON is. Roger Ebert's review is probably the best ever written about this film: he wrote that it's not a movie but a two hour movie trailer. But ARMAGEDDON is the standard to which every ""Big Budget Hollywood Blockbuster"" stinker is set against. Personally, ARMAGEDDON is even worse than Roland Emmerich's GODZILLA (98) and that travesty was HORRENDOUS, so you can imagine how bad ARMAGEDDON is. The whole idea of getting guys who work on a oil rig to help astronauts destroy an incoming asteroid is stunningly brainless. Seriously, who greenlighted this project? This ""movie"" has absolutely nothing. It's probably the most hollow film experience ever put on celluloid. To make things even more enjoyable, it's jaw-droppingly jingoistic, so much so that I wanted the piece of rock to slam into planet earth  and kill the whole human race once and for all.I've never seen so many actors wasted in one single movie. No one gives a semblance of a performance. It's all posing and screaming and in the very embarrassing for everyone concern. The editing is epileptic. The look of the film is like a Budweiser commercial. The science is unacceptably unscientific, even for an escapist movie. Dialogue that made my ears bleed. And the action was silly. The world is about to end and they go party at a strip club where women throw themselves at them. Sure. The space shuttles take forever to land on the asteroid but it only takes them a couple of seconds to leave it. The asteroid pieces always crash into big cities (NY, Paris, Hong Kong...). The never-ending use of slow-motion shots. Machine guns on the rovers. Why?!?! Did they expect to find nasty aliens on the asteroid? Mind-numbingly loud! I can't stress enough how loud ARMAGEDDON is. It's nearly offensive and it takes a lot to offend me. All in all, ARMAGEDDON is the perfect showcase for everything that's wrong with movies these days.",Armageddon
93,baumer,Do they give out Oscars for fun movies?,10,16 August 2001,"May be spoilersI think people become delusional after they have seen a film one to many times. How this film rates a 5.8 on the IMDb is beyond me. Armageddon was probably the best summer film in 98 and it holds that lofty opinion in my mind because it was as entertaining as they come. Jerry Bruckheimer has been making hits since the 80's when he gave us Beverly Hills Cop and he just keeps churning them out. When an asteroid is about to hit Earth, NASA calls on the best deep core drilling team in the world. This is comprised of Harry Stamper, Bear, Rockhound, AJ, Max and Chick and a few others that die early in the film. But what we have here is a colorful assortment of characters. But what these colorful assortment of characters bring to the table is perhaps what makes this film a few notches better than many other films that are similar to it, either with an asteroid plot or as a disaster film. Armageddon is head and shoulders above similar offerings like Deep Impact and the much inferior Canadian film, Last Night.I think the writers of this film deserve much of the credit for writing some very emotionally galvanized scenes that range from global despair, young love, family love, love lost that may rekindle and plenty of humour. Much of the humour is provided by two actors that have really come into their own since doing this film. Those actors are Steve Buscemi and Michael Clarke Duncan. Buscemi was quite famous before this film but his impeccable timing and perfect delivery of lines like, ""Yea, I've seen this one. Isn't this when the coyote sat his ass down in the ACME rocket and chased the coyote? No really, isn't it? Because it didn't turn out too good for the coyote."" And ""Isn't it nice to know that if the space program fails, you'll always have a job at Helga's house of pain?"" And Bear is played perfectly by Duncan. His best scenes are when he shows his vulnerability. Duncan is a massive man, about 6'5 and over 300 pounds so when you see him crying and asking for hugs, it accomplishes perfectly what the writers and director were aiming for. There are many seemingly flawless scenes in this film and sandwiched somewhere in between the humour and the action are some very powerful scenes with Harry and his daughter Grace and even with Chick and his former wife and son that doesn't know him. Bruckheimer and Bay wisely included a wide palette of emotions to keep everyone interested and it worked as Armageddon grossed about 500 million dollars on a world wide scale.Armageddon is a perfect summer film and it is one worth owning. Every once in a while throw the film into your VCR or DVD player and sit back and be entertained. There are few films that are better at pure entertainment. This is a grand movie on the scale of a Titanic. It is not quite as good as the sinking ship saga but it is certainly not as bad as many asinine critics will have you believe. There is enough action to please those from the Raiders of the Lost school, enough comedy to accommodate those from the Beverly Hills Cop school and enough romance and tear jerking situations to please those from the Pretty Woman school. There is really very little wrong with this film and if you haven't seen it, you have no idea what you are missing.9.5 out of 10-- The best summer film of 98!",Armageddon
94,film-critic,A Framed Picture that would make Norman Rockwell proud...,9,15 April 2008,"If Norman Rockwell and Orson Scott Card had a child, in a bizarre new world, they would have written the screenplay for ""Armageddon"". An uncompromising look at what goes into the word Americana, Michael Bay has crafted a story that is pumped full of so many clichés that it becomes an entertaining, full-throttle action film that can be watched again and again. With a surprising cast and superb special effects, Bay uses the camera to create powerful artistic images coupled with the staples of what makes films of this nature unique. In this reviewer's eyes, ""Armageddon"" is one of those films where Bay has tricked the common audience. It is a typical summer blockbuster in every sense of the word, there are explosions, there are great lines, there are out-of-this world scenes, but he does this while incorporating hidden messages throughout. Perhaps I am looking a bit too deep into just another science fiction action film, but when ""Armageddon"" came through the DVD player, I wasn't ready. I was a nay-sayer to Criterion for adding this film to their collection, but now  in 2008  it makes perfect sense. Michael Bay has created a picture-perfect image of America. He has taken our desire for the inanimate, our non-perfect hero, slices of us through images of the Midwest (or of a time that we may have forgotten), and our religion to be the best and transformed it into a film. Yes, this is a science fiction film, yes this is the film about the big asteroid that only Bruce Willis can stop, and yes  Ben Affleck does attempt to act  but it is perfection. If our country was eliminated, and we needed a film for our history books  I wouldn't argue with ""Armageddon"". Now, let's let the argument begin.The acting, come on, it's ""Armageddon"" people, but Bay is notorious for at least creating enjoyable characters. Buscemi is always worth the screen time, while Will Patton rounds out the voice of reason. The looming voice-over by Charlton Heston seemed to suck me into the story, while Willis and Affleck's banter seemed over the top, and at times annoying. They played their parts perfectly, yet it still had me on the edge of my seat. Liv Tyler gave it her all, and the way Bay filmed her (less words more emotion) was perfect. She carried the weight of her father and soon-to-be fiancé well into the asteroid. Compliments should be handed to Mr. Thornton as well, the man has a pair of chops on him, and if he could avoid the angry comedian films, he could remember that he has the talent. He was the epitome of NASA, the genius that had to work on the worst budget to save the world. Rewinding back to the notion that this is America in all of it's glory, these characters work perfectly. Willis' character reminded me of a mortal superhero. His ability to drill anywhere was his power, and his sense of nationalism, his idea of patriotism, bled from the screen. ""Armageddon"" played like a comic, with your muscling characters, cheap jokes, picture-esquire landscapes, and simple fix to a big problem. Again, it was cliché  all of these characters can be seen in any other film close to the same nature or entitled ""summer blockbuster"", but with Bay, he seemed to be saying more. Affleck was the only downfall on the character side. He was Ben playing Ben; there wasn't that sense of anything outside of comic timing and love interest needed. He wasn't Bruce, he wasn't anyone except filler.The story was simple. Bay simply used the K.I.S.S. method to compile the script (the Keep It Simple Stupid), asteroid headed to Earth, nobody saw it, and it is up to Bruce to surrender to the beast. It is Mr. Michael Bay that must be complimented for this film. While other critics will argue that this isn't anything but drivel, I found it to be symbolic, surreal, and honest all at the same time. While other films will show America in a way that only the educated will see it, Bay throws it right in our face and we are unable to stop it. Golf on a cruise liner, Willis portraying this ""everyman"", the types of cars that our characters drive, the fact that upon completion of this task everyone want inanimate objects (power, sex, money), one cannot help but wonder what Bay is attempting to say about our culture. Michael Bay is the director of gluttony. I can attest that I couldn't stand this film upon viewing it the first time. I was horrified to see it in the Criterion gambit, but watching it again  older and wiser with film  I am happy to see it in the collection. ""Armageddon"" is America. It is the birth of the superhero, it is the cliché Americana that we face everyday; it is exactly what makes American cinema  well  American. Bay, in this film, has captured the truth. What makes this summer blockbuster even more enticing is that there is just a sprinkling of explosions, and most don't happen until the final third of the film. He has tricked us, made us believe that this is a no-brainer of a film, when it is in fact chalk full of symbolism that the faintest of film aficionados can smile under their breath.Overall, as I begin to sound more and more repetitive, ""Armageddon"" - the Criterion release - blew my mind for the first time although it was my second viewing. I am eager to re-watch again Bay's ""The Rock"" which also found a Criterion release, with skeptics on both sides. The Norman Rockwell vision, the lack of any real science fiction until the third act, and the detail of the characters without devoting hours upon hours to them, made for strong  unparalleled cinema.

96,IonicBreezeMachine,"The backwash of 90s blockbuster excess that encompasses everything about 90s blockbusters, save for the fun.",3,1 September 2021,"With an asteroid the size of Texas en route to earth threatening an extinction level, NASA executive director Truman (Billy Bob Thorton) is given mere weeks to find a way to avert disaster. A decision is made to use deep core drilling to plant a nuclear device in the asteroid and split the asteroid so both halves will harmlessly pass the Earth. Deep core driller Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) is approached by Truman and agrees to help navigate the drilling process using his own team of roughnecks who will undergo rushed Astronaut training to prepare themselves for a dangerous mission that humanity is counting on.Released during the Summer of 1998, Armageddon was at one point one of FOUR asteroid based movies in development with the others being Dreamworks' own Deep Impact and two other projects at 20th Century Fox and Columbia that never made it past the development stage. Supposedly this double dipping of Asteroid pictures was yet more fallout from the Jeffrey Katzenberg departure from Disney for Dreamworks where Katzenberg took the concept of an animated Ant movie to make Antz with PDI to compete with Disney Pixar's A Bug's Life and Armageddon stemmed from a ""tit for tat"" type deal to compete with Dreamworks' own Deep Impact when it was originally envisioned as a Spielberg helmed project. Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and directed by Michael Bay, the movie certainly differentiates itself from Deep Impact but in all the worst possible ways.I'll say this up front just so there's no confusion, this is a Summer Popcorn ""rollercoaster"" movie so yes the science is beyond inaccurate, and yes it's a showcase for pyrotechnics and special effects. There's nothing wrong with that. Movies like this serve a purpose as being turn off your brain escapes for people to just sit back and enjoy some slickly produced nonsense. I've given good or decent reviews to a number of them including Bruckheimer's '97 film Con Air which is ridiculous and over the top but has fun with the concept. Armageddon however is unfortunately not on the same level as Con Air, it's a bloated mess of a movie that's relentlessly fast paced, overcut with barely a shot that averages more than 2 or 3 seconds, and action sequences that are loud, explosive, and destructive, lacking spatial geography, investment, or comprehensibility as the sequences are so over done with swooping camera movements, quick cuts, smash cuts, and flashing lights that I'd be hard pressed to tell you how or even when certain characters died during the movie.And then of course there's the movie's tone is littered with glaring muscleheaded stupidity that crescendos in either cringing attempts at humor or PG-13 levels of sexualization that will maybe appeal to whatever 12-14 year old boys haven't yet discovered actual competently produced smut. And when Armageddon isn't bashing you over the head with overly broad attempts at sub sitcom level humor, it's being overly melodramatic with sappy manipulative scenes in ""Smalltown USA"" which are as scrubbed clean as Andy Griffith's Mayberry intercut with similarly staged scenes around the world that aim for the same level of Pathos as one of those Pacific Bell ""reach out"" commercials from the 90s. The movie is also way too long at 150 minutes which is really only that long because we spend 90 minutes puttering around on earth and then an hour with the actual space set segment where most of the danger comes from the stupidity and shortsightedness of our main characters rather than the rock itself. No joke our characters end up nearly killing themselves simply refueling their shuttles before they're even near the Asteroid. Also special note of criticism, the movie has a tacked on scene with a dog chewing on Godzilla toys as pretty shameless digs at Godzilla '98, but Armageddon is the last movie that should be throwing shade at other films, I don't think Godzilla '98 is that great a movie, but it's well staged with effects and scenery you can see rather than an incomprehensible mess of flashing lights and quick cuts.There's a place for explosive nonsense in movies, there's a place for ""turn off your brain"" escapist entertainment, but Armageddon isn't it. From it's over directed style that becomes downright nauseating at certain points to look at, to hokey melodrama the movie wants you to take seriously, to broadly played low brow humor the movie wants you to laugh at, Armageddon is the kind of movie that thinks it can disguise doing the bear minimum with a multimillion dollar budget. If there's anything to take away from this movie it's this: ""you deserve action you can see and follow, you deserve to leave a popcorn movie feeling exhilarating not exhausted, you deserve better""",Armageddon
97,brchthethird,Overstuffed but serviceable popcorn flick,6,14 November 2014,"If there is one positive thing about Michael Bay and his movies, it's consistency. From his very first film, it was clear what he was about: explosions, hot women and awkward humor. In almost 20 years, nothing has changed and upon watching Armageddon, it seems like this is probably his purest film marketed to the widest audience possible (since R-rated movies are limited to ages 17 and up). The story is about an asteroid which is headed towards earth. NASA recruits a team of deep core drillers to be trained as astronauts, so that they dig a hole in an asteroid where a nuclear bomb will be placed. Along for the ride is one of the most impressive ensemble casts ever, although a lot of them don't really get to do that much. Most of them are also nothing more than caricatures rather than fully developed characters. The best performances come from Bruce Willis as Harry Stamper, the leader of the drilling team, and Billy Bob Thornton as Dan Truman, the NASA guy who recruits Stamper in the first place. There's also Ben Affleck, Steve Buscemi, Liv Tyler and several other recognizable actors who round out the cast. So, what worked? For starters, the filmmaking and cinematography was appropriately epic and restrained, especially compared to the hyper-kinetic style which Bay was to use with the Transformers movies. With the exception of a few intense sequences, one has a sense of place and the action is fairly easy to follow. This film also has impressive visual effects, probably the best that 1998 had to offer. Of particular note are some outer space asteroid sequences and a nicely done destruction of Paris. There was also rather good practical effects and use of miniatures, which was a nice change of pace from today's CGI-obsessed blockbusters. Moving on to where this movie falls short. One would think that with such a great cast that the movie would be outstanding as a result, and you'd only be partially correct. While the film does have a lot of individual moments that are funny, or touching, nothing really coalesces. Instead of fully-formed characters, you mostly have stereotypes and caricatures, which is rather sad for a movie that lasts 150 minutes. There's also a romantic subplot between Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler that could have been completely left out. Of course, then they wouldn't have had an excuse to include one of the sappiest songs that Aerosmith has ever recorded (and whose lead singer, Steven Tyler, is Liv Tyler's father). There was also some pacing issues, namely that the first hour compresses about two weeks of training, and then the remaining 90 minutes takes place over the course of about one or two days. And of course, we get all the standard Michael Bay-isms. There's a ridiculous amount of explosions, misplaced ""humor,"" leery shots of scantily clad women (from one scene in a strip club), upward facing camera angles and lots of slow motion (although not as much as some of his other work). Put together, the various ingredients which make up a Michael Bay movie do, for the most part, work here. It's not deep, and it's not trying to be either. This is popcorn entertainment at it's finest, and for sheer spectacle this is one of the best summer blockbusters ever made. That being said, I usually demand more of my movies and prefer not to have to turn off my brain very often to enjoy a movie. There are lots of people who absolutely love this stuff, but I'm not one of them. I thought it was passable entertainment, and certainly not one of Bay's worst (I'm looking at you, Transformers 2).",Armageddon
98,sarastro7,Unspeakably awful,2,24 November 2004,"Being an unrelenting non-stop over-the-top explosive melodrama, this movie is one of the worst action flicks ever produced, and utterly unbelievable in every way. The pace is constantly fever-pitched, and all the action and the actors are gripped by total hysteria. It is nigh unwatchable, and a stain - nay, a blotch - on the careers of everyone involved.The wildly exaggerated attempt at excitement undermines itself, resulting in a movie where you just go ""Come on!"" all the time. The setting and the events are impossible to take even remotely seriously.

99,vip_ebriega,"Michael Bay directs a different kind of ""rock"" in big-budget disaster film.",8,24 April 2007,"Review summary: Put your mind to rest and wallow in the mindless, summer excitement.To start with, ""Armageddon"" was a fine film, but it relied too much on its wealth on special effects and big-named cast to give audiences a charm, but it misses a lot from what it needed. There is simply no comparison of this film to its counterpart ""Deep Impact"". Armageddon lacks a deeper human dimension. But what the heck! This movie's fun! The reason for the comparison is they both show the same plot, they both give as a glimpse of the end-of-the-world, by a comet, and a group of ""saviors"" who try to blow it up and save the world. This time, it's Bruce Willis and his oil rig crew who are hired by NASA to pilot two space shuttle to blow up a large comet (aka ""The Global Killer"") before it hits the Earth.The plot of course, is easy to take. I mean how hard will it be to understand a plot of a killer comet and a group of oil rig workers who sacrifice their lives, I guess the longest range of time will be 5 seconds. Stupid, yes, but its so wrong, its just all right. The characters, of course, don't sum up for too much, considering that the film stars big names (names like Bruce Willis or Ben Affleck may have you quite disappointed) . If the film added more to what it can offer, it would have turned out better. But as it is, Armageddon is worth a summer movie thumbs up and a big bowl of popcorn.Rating: **** out of 5.",Armageddon
100,CitizenCaine,I WANT To Close My Eyes!,5,7 September 2003,"Many viewers are befuddled as to why this movie was so popular. There are no characters in this movie, only a motley group of cardboard cutouts. These characters merely serve the plot. I do not care about any of them either, except I was wondering why Liv Tyler would subvert her acting talent in her thankless role.The plot is about saving the world from doom; however, one can not possibly take this movie seriously. It is 2 and a half hours of one climax after another, like one long movie trailer. It overwhelms you, like watching a few hours of explosions in an IMAX theater would, both visually and audibly. If saving the world was really on the line, wouldn't we want the smartest and the most capable people up there? (Remember, the movie opens with Willis, the leader, recklessly wielding a gun; this act is repeated later by another actor yet). This movie did nothing to convince me that Bruce Willis and his boys could do the job to begin with, much less better than anyone else.The script is full of annoying asides and wisecracks that we expect to find in a Bond movie. Here they're out of place and annoying, if we're supposed to take the seriousness of the threat of the end of the world. Maybe that wasn't the intention. The movie was incredibly formulaic for such a long movie. I was able to predict many of the plot turns long before they occurred because of that. The movie's breakneck pace was off-putting too, racing from one special effects scene to the next. However, the special effects were pretty good I must admit. Many of the musical bridges were annoying; because, they were too loud and muffled the dialog. Some of the songs had little to do with the scene they were used in, like Sweet Emotion for instance. It was one big, dumb, long, loud, empty-headed, extremely shallow music video, like many one finds on MTV. It might have worked better as camp, with Aerosmith playing on the asteroid perhaps. After a promising start, the movie just seemed to fade away and become more routine (formulaic) with each passing minute, despite the intensity of some isolated scenes. After the movie, we are treated to the Aerosmith video of the complete version of the Oscar-nominated song, which lost to When You Believe from Prince Of Egypt. ** of 4 stars.",Armageddon

This from people that consider STAR WARS a science fiction masterpiece? Give me a break.  For starters, the WORST science elements of ARMAGEDDON are scientifically more accurate than any of the STAR WARS or STAR TREK films (if not the series).  If you don't believe that, pick up the CRITERION COLLECTION DVD (as I did) and listen to the scientific commentary from the NASA science advisor.  You will also find the 153 minute director's cut MUCH easier to follow (particularly during the space sequences).  Unrealistic characters?  Man, I've MET people like virtually all the characters in this movie; particularly the science geek and full time leech played by Steve Buscemi.  In fact, for a few years, I WAS that guy!  To me, this movie is a real rush. I'm sorry for you that don't ""get it.""  But, crimany, be fair, and just don't parrot the sophomoric inaccuracies of ""mainstream movie"" critics whom make a living dumping on eagerly-anticipated movies. Guys who say, ""There ARE NO 'Texas-size' asteroids"", for example.  The NASA science advisor for this movie says that, not only ARE there ""Texas-size"" asteroids, but SEVERAL have hit the earth throughout our history.  I never took the line all that literally in the movie, anyway.  I just figured that was Billy Bob Thornton's way of simplifying things for a simpleminded Texas governor whom was probably by now president.

It is all a bit long and overly edited at times with cuts literally every half second for a minute straight, but overall this is a very entertaining movie. Also an example of what Michael Bay does best and after trying to venture into more serious territories like war (Pearl Harbor) and more plot driven science fiction (The Island) it is nice to see him back this summer with Transformers.This film belongs next to science fiction films like The Core (2003) and Godzilla (1998), which is practically a companion piece to this.

Considering that ARMAGEDDON has lots of mixed reviews I hadn't high expectations for it, but I enjoyed it for what it was. Now I can go on with the review.The movie begins with a shot of our planet hit by a meteor (similar to the same that killed the dinosaurs 65 million years ago) and then we see the NASA's interior with everyone also in the White House worried for what is happening in the space. After they discover what the meteor looks like and after lots of explosions in New York City, the NASA President Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) says that if they don't find a solution within 18 days the meteor will destroy Earth. Soon the movie focuses on Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) that is the chief of an oil rigging company that has an hard time with his daughter Grace (Liv Tyler) because she is dating one of his employees, AJ Frost (Ben Affleck). Soon Harry is called by Nasa and he is commissioned lead of a mission for saving the world from outer space. He leads a ragtag team that includes also his employees that it consists of: AJ Frost, RockHound (Steve Buscemi), Oscar Choi (Owen Wilson), Bear (Michael Clarke Duncan) and Chick Chapple (Will Patton). After few days of training, some other explosions around the world and some disadventures (as you might expect with such a team) they go in mission. Once in space nothing goes as planned and after being at odds with each other and suffering some casualties, the team will manage to save the world from the asteroid (tho this manages to kill Willis' character) and AJ will finally marry with Grace.As I said in the summary the movie was a bit confusing from time to time and it was overlong (tho I have generally no problems with very long movies) but it had some qualities that made it very entertaining in its own way. The acting by everyone (Thornton, WIllis, Tyler, Buscemi, Ben Affleck and even Owen Wilson and Keith David) is good and Michael Bay's direction is decent despite his style is very evident most of the time. The soundtrack is also very good (with the nice addition of Aerosmith's I DON'T WANNA MISS A THING) and the movie itself gives a nice and nostalgic 90s feel that folks that grew up in those years will understand better.However, don't expect a masterpiece if you want to watch this movie.

This movie was a good dramatic actioneer. Ben Affleck's performance in the end was moving.

Yeah the director didn't really think this whole 'space thing' through (or I think he simply didn't care... he was just like: ""Meh, let's just make it fun""). And the movie is pretty fun, if you ignore the obvious inconsistencies and plot holes. Just take it like this: It's a movie of Bruce Willis and his team of misfits attempting to save the world by going to outer-space and blowing up a giant asteroid that's hurtling towards earth. PS. Liv Tyler at 21 y/o was unbelievably beautiful... she's distractingly gorgeous in the movie.",Armageddon
119,Peach-2,Very little to enjoy.,5,22 November 1998,"Armageddon is one of the worst movies Hollywood has made in awhile. It is also one of the loudest. Usually I wouldn't complain about great sound for a film, but this one has more sounds and effects than story. There is too much talent involved for this movie to be as bad as it ended up. Let me also say that I'm very tired of Hollywood's recent fascination with disaster movies. Maybe the disaster that this one became will make them think about a better story next time.",Armageddon
120,LebowskiT1000,"All in good fun, but not excellent.",10,14 October 2002,"Ever since this film and ""Deep Impact"" came out, I've been unsure as to which I liked better.  I've always been leaning towards Deep Impact, so the other day I watched ""Deep Impact"" and today I watched ""Armageddon"".  I have to say that on the whole, I liked Deep Impact much more.  But that doesn't mean that Armageddon isn't a good movie, in it's own right, Armageddon has some good things going for it.Armageddon is much ""flash-ier"" than Deep Impact and definitely more action-oriented.  You can tell that director Michael Bay went for the ""what looks coolest"" approach, which is fine with me, but sometimes he went a little too far.  Michael Bay also seems to like going for the ""absolute worst case scenario"" / ""get there just in time"" sort of situations.  As I said, Armageddon has some good things going for it.  The story is pretty good, the acting is quite good, there is a great deal of humor, a lot of great lines, and some superb special effects.  Also, this films plays the ""romance chip"" much more than Deep Impact does, so if it's romance you want, then this is the film for you.There are a bunch of superb actors in this film, including Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Will Patton, Steve Buscemi, William Fichtner, Owen Wilson, Michael Clarke Duncan, Peter Stormare, Jason Isaacs, Ken Hudson Campbell, and Keith David.  All of the cast did a fantastic job and I really liked their characters!  I thought they were all very unique and quite interesting to watch.  Their interactions were great to watch as well.All in all, I thought this was just a fun, action-packed, humorous, sci-fi story, with a touch of romance.  I wouldn't recommend this to everyone, but it should appeal to a wide variety of people.  Also, don't start watching this film expecting a completely realistic film, because this isn't.  It's just a fun story, with a lot of cool things to look at.  I would say that if you're torn between watching ""Armageddon"" or ""Deep Impact"" and don't plan on watching both films, then go with Deep Impact, but as I can see from the reviews on this site, it seems that everyone disagrees.  Some like Deep Impact more, some like Armageddon more, some (like me) like them both, and some hate them both.  So, I'm not really sure what to tell you.  Well, if you end up seeing this film, I hope you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",Armageddon

First off, asteroids simply don't look like that, except perhaps in an artists tortured mind, nor do they act like this one does. Also, shuttles don't fly like fighter planes in space, banking and maneuvering like the infamous Battle Star Galactica fighters. Secondly, NASA just happens to have not one but two ""shuttles"" of a never seen before design sitting around begging to be used. Third, but probably most telling, is that the NASA people can't seem to do much of anything right, so they have to recruit Harry and his crew to save the planet in only 18 days...with a unique little compact drilling rig that NASA conveniently ""stole"" from Harry himself but can't get working right...and the obligatory Nuclear weapon that just so happens to be the right size to fit into the hole they drill.Ohhh, and don't forget the old decrepit Russian ""gas station"" parked in orbit that conveniently can refuel both shuttles, complete with its own ""attendant"", an eccentric and grumpy old codger who believes the only correct solution for anything mechanical or electronic is to give it a good bashing with whatever wrench is handy.Well, you get the picture I suppose.

And they used a cast of well known actors just so the audience will be able to recognize them. That is how empty and interchangeable the characters are. How do you take a film about a possible apocalypse and turn it into nothing but a bunch of guys bickering on some asteroid? As you watch, you realise this could be happening anywhere and the bickering could be about anything. The asteroid becomes irrelevant to the action. And the action allows no emotional involvement.

One might as well protest the impossibility of Superman defying gravity, or wearing his red underpants over his blue tights. This film is obviously not about the technicalities of travelling the solar system, astronaut training, the practical applications of nuclear power, intercultural fraternisation in outer space, or similar topics.Instead, it seems to be about team spirit, meeting challenges, family values, doing the right thing, handing the torch on down the generations, self-sacrifice, and the built-in dumbness of corporate suits. Corny and as old-fashioned as anyone might wish, but I found it entertaining, and even enjoyable.

127,AKS-6,Good entertainment in spite of flaws,5,16 December 1999,"""Armageddon"" is one of those films that you are not supposed to like. Probably because it's more about special effects than an interesting script. So, having said that, I must admit that even though I didn't want to like it I actually did. Sure, I'm not saying that I like it in the same way I like, for instance, Bergman's ""Smiles of a Summer Night"" or Tamahori's ""Once Were Warriors"", but I still like it. It's not a masterpiece, but I think it is great entertainment and sometimes that's exactly what I need, two hours of watching a film that doesn't force me use my brain too much.And Billy Bob Thornton's in it! I actually didn't know that before I saw this film (shame on me, because Billy Bob is one of my favourite actors). And Steve Buscemi was hilarious. Peter Stormare was kind of irritating, he needs to get other parts than the ones he's been doing lately (like a German nihilist in ""The Big Lebowski"" and Velvet in ""8MM""), he was still pretty funny though. Bruce Willis was not very good, I think we're all tired of watching him save the world or a city or whatever. Liv Taylor is not the best actress around, but then her part didn't demand much, so I guess she did alright. Ben Affleck was nothing special. I hardly remember he was in the film at all.Well, good entertainment, at times a lousy script, though, and good performances from at least two people of the cast I'm not ashamed to give this film 5/10.",Armageddon

It is perfectly directed (Michael Bay), with a great cast including Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thorton, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, and a host of others.While Deep Impact worked too much to have a feasible story to it, Armageddon went strictly for the ""AWW"" reaction.  This film is full of eye candy that will catch you from the opening sequence, and keep hold of you all the way to the final explosion.  While it's special effects were definitely fun to watch, the story lacked only in the dialogue.  Thinking that the audience didn't want to be overwhelmed with technical mumbo-jumbo, the writers chose to use ""baby"" terms easier for us to understand.  While this did infact slightly deminish the dialogue, the actors cast to portray the heros did an excellent job relaying the script. Steve Buscemi was great in the comedic role and Michael Clark Duncan was hilariously funny at times as a big, strong, muscle bound man, with a childish weak side to him. The beginning of this movie will have you sitting on the edge of your seat, and by the end, you will definitely have a tear in your eye just creeping down your cheek.

A plan is hatched to send up a team of deep Earth drillers to lay in a nuclear device and split the asteroid before it gets too close, deflecting the two halves enough to miss us.Once again, for the slow people in the back, it is a disaster film. The science is going to be terrible. If you have not yet figured out that fact from this and any other disaster films, you never will. I feel that the people that watch these and then judge them based upon how bad the science is are the same people that go to a Star Trek movie with a book that gives a breakdown of the Enterprise and get upset when the movie ship and book ship differ. These are meant as fantasy and escapism devices, not science lessons.This is a good film, with a great cast and many amazing one liners.

Hills Cop, Days of thunder, Con Air (I consider it as the last of the Great)and many other great movies he sank into a hole he might never climb out of again. What the hell was this crap. I used to love, no, ADORE the beginning of every Bruckheimer/Simpson movie, you know, the camera over an empty road and suddenly lightning strikes, or now when the camera suddenly turns right into a tree,  because it stood for quality action and entertainment in the best possible way. But after the yoakles, who of course have never been to space, but instead know how to drill deep holes into earth (duuh!)an are so chosen instead of the qualified astronauts, save the world, I lost a great deal of faith in the Bruckheimer/ Bay duo. It was completely lost after Pearl Harbor. Man, Michael Bay really took a nasty turn after Bad Boys an The Rock(both excellent , excellent action movies) The only good thing that came from Bruckheimer after that was CSI-not exactly realistic, but hey, there wouldn't be much of a show if they didn't take over every case they came across. But enough about that. This movie was made for 12 year old's and if you don't believe me, well who's stopping you. Go see it, enjoy the almost 2 and a 1/2 hours of pure idiotism and don't forget to cry at the end like you're supposed to. The middle age man sitting next to me did, I kid you not, and he was the most significant reason why I give this movie 5/10. Hey, if Michael Bay can make adult men cry after this movie( which should definitely be considered as a chick flick, the same as the ever so popular Titanic and Pearl Harbor)he really is a genius.",Armageddon

Bruce Willis is still in his action hero phase, not having yet matured, but still good. Billy Bob Thornton is right on target. Ben Affleck as yet to reach his peak, yet delivers a solid performance. Liv Tyler easily tugs at our heart strings. Steve Buscemi and Michael Clarke Duncan are hilarious and perfect. And finally, you don't see enough of Owen Wilson in his small role.The bad. The amount of testosterone contained in this film could put an 80s East German female swimmer to shame.

I noticed America is the only country to do anything in this movie, but the story would have fallen apart if there were 20 other countries going for it as well. It's not being ""racist"". Also, the main characters aren't supposed to be ""astronauts"", this isn't Apollo XIII or whatever, oil drillers going on an asteroid to blow it up, come on, its different. We don't want another boring space movie. The main parts I'll agree with people in bringing this movie's rating down were the drama, and Ben Affleck. The drama in this movie was very misplaced. It was very long, drawn out, and plain boring. I felt no emotion watching it whatsoever, and I wasn't supposed to as this wasn't supposed to be a drama movie in the first place. Then there's Ben Affleck, the king of the drama. WHy was he in this movie? In fact, why is he in any movie? He ruins every movie he's in.

When I first saw this at the cinema back in 1998, I remember thinking it was one of the dumbest films ever plus I was completely fed up with the ""natural disaster"" genre that was drowning society. Would time change my perception? ""Armageddon"" deals with the question ""what would happen if a meteor bigger than earth hit earth?"". For some reason the US discovered this threat and decided they alone could come up with the answer. Their solution was to send a bunch of misfits who drill for oil into a spaceship to land on the meteor, drill a huge hole in it, then send a nuclear bomb inside it and blow it up from the inside. Genius.NASA enlists the ""world's best driller"", luckily also American Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) to come and help select the best drill and a plan to get the bomb into the meteor. Harry thinks it will be easier to use his crew who he's used to working with, rather than professional astronauts and scientists. Reluctantly NASA agrees and starts training the crew for the most important job ever in the world. During and after the tests it's clear the team isn't up to it, but they go anyways. Will this cast of misfits save the world? Take a wild guess.Worth watching for the pure comedy factor, if you can overcome the normal US arrogance and ridiculous storyline. A solid cast, given little to work with, covers a multitude of flaws, most noticeably the crappy Aerosmith theme song.

""How can you POSSIBLY hate this movie?""Let me count the ways:ONE is for the fact that ""Armageddon"" proposes that it is easier to train a bunch of oil drillers to be astronauts (without a single one failing any test, and with a deadline set by a gigantic asteroid about to knock us out of orbit and send us screaming into the center of the sun) than it is to show a professional space team how to operate a drill.TWO is for the destruction of New York City being practically forgotten after it happens.  You'd expect something like that to at least make the national news in a few seconds but there's no mention of it once we're on the oil rig in the next scene.THREE is for the introduction of Bruce Willis' character.  He's supposed to be the hero.  The audience isn't going to like the hero all that much if, the first time we meet him, he's chasing his daughter's boyfriend with a massive shotgun.  (Well, you wouldn't THINK the audience would like him.)FOUR is for how a single character dies in ""Top Gun"" (the Bruckheimer/Scott movie I actually like) and we're bawling, while the entire population of Paris is wiped out in ""Armageddon"" and it barely raises an eyebrow.FIVE is for how everyone I've met enjoys this movie over ""the Truman Show"", which is like preferring the taste of dog food to Filet Mignon.SIX is for how there's Earth normal gravity in the space station and the asteroid unless the plot requires for it to be less, so Ben Affleck can play Evil Knevil.SEVEN is for how there are Dramatic Sunsets everywhere on Earth at the same time, ignoring time zones and the International Date Line.EIGHT is for the Inevitable Red Wire/Green Wire Bomb Disarming Scene.  First of all, I'm not a detonation expert but I'm pretty sure government issued bombs do not follow this pattern.  Second of all, *ahem* THE GUY TRYING TO DISARM THE BOMB BUILT THE DAMN THING IN THE FIRST PLACE!!! Shouldn't he know how it works?NINE is for the Touching Finale where a character must sacrifice himself so that he can set the bomb off, exploding the asteroid and saving the planet. So why in the heck does he feel it necessary to give a Big Long Soliloquy AT THE LAST MINUTE, THREATENING EVERY SINGLE CREATURE ON THE PLANET WITH AN AGONIZING DEATH, so he can say farewell to his friends?!?TEN is for that damn Aerosmith song.  It's their only number one hit.  Of all their songs, that Dianne Warren penned tripe is the most popular.

But it is still an exciting adrenaline filled summer blockbuster, though far from the best of its ilk.On a few positive notes, the special effects are for the most part quite good for its time, the performers are likable and the emotional manipulation despite its heavy handedness can still be effective.The shots from the second unit which feature a vast array of citizens from all over the world waiting for the oncoming disaster and for the Americans to save the day of course are so ambiguously commercial that you could slap any corporate logo in the world on top and produce a very nice looking 30 second television commercial.",Armageddon

143,mnpollio,A big barrel of noise and flashes for the ADD generation,4,9 August 2010,"The second (and better) of 1998's dynamic duo of garbage about heavenly objects on a collision course with Earth - although this says more about the lousy quality of the earlier Deep Impact rather than any specific accomplishments of this ordeal. A giant asteroid is on a collision course with Earth and NASA taps oil rig worker Bruce Willis and his motley band to travel to the stars to intercept the asteroid, drill into it and blow it to pieces before impact. Naturally precursor fragments hit Earth first to give us a small taste of the disaster that could be coming. The entire scenario is ludicrous, but the film knows it and seems to revel in it. Dumb can be fun if done well, but Armageddon is not particularly well done, despite having some promising elements. Lead Willis normally has two settings depending on the project - smarmy and lifeless. Since this is a ""crowd-pleasing"" action flick, he trots out smarmy and manages to be thoroughly obnoxious. Look quick for Owen Wilson and Michael Clarke Duncan as some of the lesser members of the team. Billy Bob Thornton acquits himself nicely slumming it up as a sympathetic NASA official. Will Patton also manages to turn in a ""real"" performance as another oil rigger. Ben Affleck manages to be appealing in his first ""big budget"" effort and Liv Tyler is coltishly sexy as Willis' daughter and the token love interest. Keeping in the spirit of the film's overwhelming machismo, she gets to stay behind and look fretful while the ""real"" men do the work. Actually Jessica Steen accompanies as a co-pilot, but since someone forgot to write her a role she is fairly irrelevant. The screenplay is a mess - there is barely any sort of character development and suspense is marginal at best. The tone is jingoistic to the point of nausea - there are so many flags flying that it seems like Fox News Channel at its most pandering. The cinematography is like ball-bearings in a blender with assorted eyeball-burning flashes thrown in for good measure. There are literally no sustained shots for more than 3 seconds and action scenes are often incomprehensible due to so many non-stop quick cuts.

144,Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,"Well done movie, but not good storyline",6,17 June 2008,"The latest testosterone-saturated blow-'em-up from producer Jerry Bruckheimer and director Michael Bay (The Rock, Bad Boys) continues Hollywood's millennium-fueled fascination with the destruction of our planet. There's no arguing that the successful duo understands what mainstream American audiences want in their blockbuster movies--loads of loud, eye-popping special effects, rapid- fire pacing, and patriotic flag waving. Bay's protagonists--the eight crude, lewd, oversexed (but lovable, of course) oil drillers summoned to save the world from a Texas-sized meteor hurling toward the earth--are not flawless heroes, but common men with whom all can relate. In this huge Western-in-space soap opera, they're American cowboys turned astronauts. Sci-fi buffs will appreciate Bay's fertilizing of technology, even though it's apparent he doesn't understand it as anything more than flashing lights and shiny gadgets. Smartly, the duo also tries to lure the art-house crowd, raiding the local indie acting stable and populating the film with guys like Steve Buscemi, Billy Bob Thornton, Owen Wilson, and Michael Duncan, all adding needed touches of humor and charisma. When Bay applies his sledgehammer aesthetics to the action portions of the film, it's mindless fun; it's only when Armageddon tackles humanity that it becomes truly offensive. Not since Mississippi Burning have racial and cultural stereotypes been substituted for characters so blatantly--African Americans, Japanese, Chinese, Scottish, Samoans, Muslims, French ... if it's not white and American, Bay simplifies it. Or, make that white male America; the film features only three notable females--four if you count the meteor, who's constantly referred to as a ""bitch that needs drilling',"" but she's a hell of a lot more developed and unpredictable than the other women characters combined. Sure, Bay's film creates some tension and contains some visceral moments, but if he can't create any redeemable characters outside of those in space, what's the point of saving the planet?",Armageddon
145,flicklover,I can't help it!!! I really enjoy this movie!!!,8,5 May 2020,"Armageddon was the most hated movie by film critics for years. It was the second movie in 1998 about a huge asteroid tumbling towards earth. The other movie was Deep Impact. Considered to be the ""serious"" one of the two movies.There is not much story here. Harry Stamper, an expert oil driller is brought in by NASA to help them with a plan to destroy the asteroid before it hits earth. That's it. A cast of roughnecks as they are called go along with Harry into space to land on the asteroid to drill a hole big enough to get a nuclear bomb far enough to blow up the thing. Armageddon was directed by Michael Bay. And even though this was his 3rd directing gig it was the first of his movies that he showed the most of his directing and editing rapid fire style that he known for. Personally he has taken this to the limits especially in the Transformers movies. It is supposed to be adrenaline pumping action but at times it is so over the top that it is exhausting. Armageddon is like that. Big, loud and exhausting at times. But, it's fun. As much as I agree that this movie is as dumb as anything ever to hot the screen it is just fun. The cast includes Ben Affleck, Billy Bob Thorton, Liv Tyler, Owen Wilson and Steve Buscemi. Among other less known actors. You would say that this movie comes under the ""so bad it's good"" category. Maybe so.Grade: B",Armageddon

By the way, it was my favorite music composer too - Hans Zimmer. I advise this film especially those, who like good ""old school"" cinema. But it, as well, will appeal to those, who grew/grows in new time after 2000-th. I revised this film four times on TV, as a child, three times on computer with friends, and girlfriend. I'm sure, that it will not be the last time I will have a desire to see this amazing film. Alone, or with someone.

The cast is perfect for this film, making the characters and the film even more fun and enhancing the impression of this truly entertaining film.Bruce Willis is a great choice for the role of Harry S. Stamper, but all the supporting characters are fun too, and that's one of the most important things in this film.The film does not try to be realistic, but entertaining, and it succeeds in that.The film is well directed and easy to watch, the special effects are good, and the soundtrack is excellent and fits the film perfectly.An unrealistic, hilarious, outrageous and incredibly entertaining film that can be watched over and over again.",Armageddon

I was surprise to see that Bruce Willis acting in this kind of film.  But, I suppose he wants to show people that he's not just an action movie actor, and he can be comic too. I watch this with a friend, who saw it before me and says it's the best funny film of the 1990's.  My friend spent his time telling me the punches.  We laugh for about 95 % of the film! It's so silly to see the cliche, the stereotypes (Ah! those Russians, you know?) the weak plot, the scientific absurdity, those big big Hollywood boom boom boom special effects, that nasty big big boom boom boom sonic sound, the primitive American patriotism.  Yes it was very funny! But I prefer Leslie Nielsen.  Perhaps Bruce Willis had a future in comic movie.  This is a very good start.",Armageddon

151,jeremy3,Entertaing Bad Film,6,24 February 2021,"I do not understand why critics hated this movie. The main point of a movie is to entertain the audience. Admittedly, on the surface it is about as schmaltzy, bubble gum, and simplistic as can be. Maybe that was Michael Bay's whole point. The movie had great special effects. The audience was entertained for the whole movie. No time for boredom. The best part were the silly quips and one liners that the actors said. They were not real astronauts. They were oil workers, and they were not afraid to whine and express their frustrations about their lot trying to save the Planet. The message was to never give up, and to trust yourself and your team. It was a bad cliched movie, but maybe it was really poking fun and having fin satirizing all disaster movies. So, I will not say it is Academy Award material, but the movie entertained.",Armageddon
152,tburke85,Armageddon A Good But Overlong Action Aventure,6,15 June 2009,"Armageddon is a good but overlong action adventure from director Michael Bay who does show his talent with this movie but the running time of 150 minutes does weight it down a bit. Bay none the less proves to be a skilled filmmaker no matter how good or bad his movies turned out. The talented cast are admirable in their roles including Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thorton, Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck, Will Patton, and Steve Buscemi. Jason Isaacs, Keith David, Peter Storemare, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Owen Wilson in a brief appearance are effective as the supporting characters in their limited screen time. The special effects are state of the art even though you can tell it's CGI. The action sequences are intense but it's the scenes in between and the slow pace at times is what hurt the film the most at least to me. The music seemed to sync very well with what was happening on the screen including the song by Aerosmith and it fit the tone of the film.There was some suspense build up as the giant asteroid in space gets closer and closer to Earth while the heroes desperately try to destroy it in time to save their planet. The ending was touching but I found it to be a little predictable but fortunately the good outweighs the bad in this one. Armageddon isn't a great movie but it's not too bad either if it had been shorter I probably would've enjoyed the film more than I did. Overall despite it's flaws, Armageddon is an overlong but for the most part an entertaining adventure with just enough action, some suspense, thrills, impressive special effects, humor, a little romance, and good performances by the cast who make it worth watching at least once.",Armageddon

But the rest of the movie made me sleep. The same things happened over and over again and it was just so unrealistic and stupid. The story is stupid, some of the dialoges are embarrassing and when the movie is over, all you can think of is the main question: Why bring a mini-gun to space? What, are they afraid of evil moon-people at NASA or what? The plot is silly, and the way everybody brags, ''These are the best oil drillers in the world'', is even more silly. The start, and fine acting raises the grade but it still doesn't worth more than 2 out of 5.",Armageddon
154,galileo3,Critically frustrating yet somehow personally satisfying...,5,1 February 2008,"Armageddon (1998)It's loud, it's big, it's explosive, it's cheesy, it's dumb, a film so Hollywood-ised it is noticeable in almost every scene. Armageddon is flawed, from its shallow characters, to its outrageous storyline and beautifully sentimental scenes and general lack of originality. However, there is something about this film, that I do like. Past all its negatives, it manages to be entertaining, somewhat funny and at times strangely emotionally intense. So there must be something in Michael Bay's 140 million dollar blockbuster that went right and something must have, because this was hugely successful.Why are there 3 helicopters flying over in every single 'emotional' scene? and why do we always get that slow motion effect? Armageddon, as I said is critically frustrating, yet somehow personally satisfying and for that it saves it self from an extremely low rating.5/10",Armageddon

No feeling for pacing - every important scene goes like 10 seconds, it's impossible to evolve any kind of emotions. Plus it feels like the same 2 songs are playing over EVERYTHING which try to give it a more 'epic' feeling, which kills the vibe more, cause you can't save a bad script by putting music over everything. Sparks and explosions everywhere for no reason. Rock colliding with rock = explosion. Rock colliding with wooden house = explosion. This is so shallow.
Also the plot has so many trashy illogical parts, unfortunately overweighing the good parts.
Physics are off or very hard to believe.
In the end, this is just a movie with good actors and a lot of potential which was thrown in a trash can for no reason at all. I'd love to see a remake of this. Without Michael Bay.",Armageddon
156,Jerique,You don't want to miss this one.,9,10 January 2009,"Armageddon is one of the most acclaimed films of all time and not because of how great or entertaining it is. It's because it's a film premise that can be easily related to. You can feel and sympathize with each and every character.It's got a huge ensemble cast of A-list actors anchored by Bruce Willis. I know that Bruce Willis is the lead protagonist in the film and receives most screen time and thus, probably most praise. However, I believe, Billy Bob Thornton and William Fichtner really shine most of all. Thornton is not really known for dramatic roles and when it comes to this film, he knows what he's doing almost as good as Tom Hanks. William Fichtner is a favorite of mine because I've seen him in so many roles now and I still can't get passed this performance as it's so mesmerizing.It's not just those three top list actors either, though they powerfully show their intense passion for acting, but also there's the likes of Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Owen Wilson, Michael Clark Duncan, and many many more. It's a ensemble cast, I think, which only amplifies this movie's powerful inspirational premise.As the movie begins, Dan Truman (Thornton) and the rest of NASA find out they have 18 days before an asteroid the size of Texas will destroy Earth and all mankind. It's up to NASA to train Harry Stamper (Willis) and his crew along with Colonel Sharp (Fichtner) to drill a hole, drop a nuke and save the world.As the movie progresses, there's a friction between A.J. (Affleck) and Harry about Harry's daughter, Grace (Liv Tyler) and A.J.'s relationship. Bonds between Harry and Truman form, and all the while you begin to hate General Kimsey (Keith David) as he's not helping the already chaotic situation.At the time of the film's release, Armageddon was one of the highest grossing films and a very high budgeted film. It also boasts some of the most amazing special effects and visual effects to boot. As a tear jerking film, the only downfall to the film is all the factual, geographical and continuity errors. But if you're looking passed the errors to see the film for it's entertainment and not pedantic reasoning, you will enjoy Armageddon.It's known as one of the most epic disaster films of all time along with The Day After Tomorrow and 2012. It's no wonder why Michael Bay is known for his high-action, fast-paced blockbusters nowadays when you see Armageddon as basically his proving ground. It's a great film for all audiences and should not be missed.",Armageddon

The ""love story"" is way to drawn out and the plot is little more then a series of things that go wrong (""Ok...the drill just broke down. Let's see..what can we do next...right...make the nuclear missile go off prematurely...what's next...an intergalactic storm...OK""), and kill almost the entire supporting cast. Not very much new or exciting here.It's also inexcusable that the movie is so sentimental and/or patriotic. OK, I'm used to Americans saving the world by now, but do they have to make it THIS obvious? Also, why are we supposed to care about a small group of paper-thin characters, while at the same time large cities filled with millions of people get wiped of the earth without anybody in the movie seeming to care?""Armageddon"" is not completely stupid and it's even a little funny sometimes, but it's also sentimental, predictable and boring.* out of **** stars",Armageddon

159,Aidan McGuinness,"Oh dear...A popcorn crunching, no brainer piece of junk",4,31 January 2002,"""Armageddon"" is the sort of movie that people can use to point out the decline in Hollywood standards. It's bubble-gum/popcorn/no-brains mass-market and lowest common denominator fare. It's a pile of well marketed (and somewhat executed) drivel. Leave your brains behind for this one.Let's look at the things it did well first - ""Armageddon"" looks mostly pretty in terms of the visual effects - watch those cities get destroyed (although the New York one is extremely eerie). That's not surprising - when you have the likes of Jerry Bruckheimer producing it generally means a meaty budget. The movie is swiftly paced - you're launched immediately into the action and given little time to start thinking (because then you'd begin to savage it). The sound editing is also fairly spot on - sharp and crisp and generally well timed. And now for all the rest... I can't let the plot go by. It's completely and utterly ridiculous. The crew have gone on record as admitting that the science of the movie is a load of cobblers and it is - sound and fires in an area with no atmosphere, gravity where it shouldn't be, never ending count-downs, a weakly contrived solution to the asteroid problem... the list goes on and on. ""Memento"" it ain't.As the movie is fairly fast we're not meant to consider this (and apparently the movie producers felt we were too stupid to notice them anyway) but we cannot help but consider the sloppy direction that Michael Bey employs at times of fast action - which is shaking the camera all over the place in a manner that's meant to emulate the terror and confusion of the scene but instead merely irritates and detracts from the moment.As for the acting - *shudder*. It's no surprise Liv Tyler got nominated for a Golden Razzie and that Bruce Willis actually won one for this picture. The characters are so thinly drawn and so hammy that I actually laughed when they opened their lines at the drivel they spewed. Talented actors like Steve Buscemi and Billy Bob Thornton are wasted here - you can't lend that much talent when the character you're playing is riddled with more cliches than a millipede has legs. May I make a point about patriotism and family values? This movie features an American Presidential speech so cringe-inducing it makes Bill Pullman's from ID4 seem positively mellow. Let's not forget the schmaltzy family scenes we're forced to witness every now and then as families prepare for the end (good riddance to them) and the scenes of the world anxiously awaiting freedom from America (as if any other country could help out...). Then there's the love-scenes between Tyler and Affleck that make you hope they never get back together to avoid future wincings from the agonized viewer. And many other overly-sentimental poorly-executed moments that will make you understand subtlety is not a word these people are familiar with.""Armageddon"" does everything brash and bold in an attempt to woo us that the shuddering mess underneath is actually a decent picture. Well - it isn't. If you can leave your brain at the door and turn off all critical faculties you may enjoy this other brainless hookum. If, like me, you're a discerning viewer than don't bother yourself the pain. The only thing I'll take from this movie is the eerie sight of the Twin Towers after the meteor strike and their resemblance to the actual attack's aftermath. Which still leaves me giving the movie 4/10.",Armageddon

But from the opening scenes, 'ARMAGEDDON' explodes into emergency action. This sci-fi comedy-drama was a solid hit!! I have to fully disagree with critics who will praise a horrible movie and then say that a story like this is not bigger than life. This is a blockbuster entertainment giant, with a striking sense of humor, which 'Rockhound' (Bucsemi) provided many laughs, along with the rest of the multi-talented and troubled 'troup' of civilized maniacs. I truly think that the plot of the story is fun to think about, the world needs to be saved by a bunch of motley-ruff necks that can hardly obey the regular laws in their own city and now, they are going to work with the laws of gravity, science and all else to keep the planet from becoming a memory. Every movie mogul wants a block buster that is going to in essence save the world from total oblation and hit the box office with a vengeance. This one does it with he-man style and a wise-crack or two. They all ride together though, Harry Stamper, Grace the young in love daughter of Harry, Charles Chapple er, I mean 'Chick', A.J. also in love with Grace much to Harry's uneasiness, 'Rockhound' who just wants to have girls' who 'just want to have fun' the man who is a sky-scraper if anything else, Jayotis 'Bear' who is strong and a bit on the sensitive side, just to give us equilibrium, when they landed on the surface of the huge rock and he looks up and emotional and exclaims Thank you Jesus! The theater roared! He was right though. Then there is 'Oscar' who is a fun having not so fearless worker, and the comically sarcastic, but easy going Max, all under N.A.S.A Administrator Dan Truman who can't fly anymore. But he gets to watch these birds-of-a-feather, working together. With everyone up and going plus Lev Andropov the Russian Cosmonaut who works hard and gets a little too rowdy! They are able even with the adversity of Col. William Sharp they come together and pull it off and even with the last few moments when Harry Gives his life for A.J. in a very touching moment the story comes together and sets it right, the screw balls have a mature moment and a sobering lesson. But this crew is great!! They all mix together like a great drink. Bruce has the Juice, along with the rest of the motley crew, making this adventure a blast, even by today's standards it still comes across with strength, style, and comedic punch! Recommended for action/adventure sci-fi junkies as well as regular Joe's' like me. (****)",Armageddon
161,mr_popcorn,Michael Bay's Armageddon,6,23 October 2006,"Plot: A huge Comet is headed for earth. As it does not consist of one big piece, but of a cloud of rather small pieces plus a main rock the size of Texas, little impacts are recorded long before the big one is scheduled for collision with earth. Harry S. Stamper and his drill team are selected to land on the main comet as they are the only ones who can work the special drill Harry developed. Their mission is to drill 800 ft. into the comet to place a nuclear explosive device. The explosion of the bomb will break the comet in two, and the two pieces will pass earth on both sides. This task has to be accomplished before a certain ""dead"" line, or the comet parts will not fly by, but hit earth.The movie, has its few pros and cons. The pros are that the visuals were stunning. Seriously, I have never seen New York like that before. Raining meteorites the size of a basketball, a 150mph flaming basketballs for that matter hits New York and destroys almost half of the city. Flaming cars go flying everywhere and the Empire State Building crumbles to the ground. hmmm. The destruction of Paris was a sight to behold. A very huge asteroid about the size of Vatican (this isn't the main asteroid, its still in space, this is like the one that got off earlier) hits right in the middle of Paris and *poof* one flick of the finger and Paris was blown to bits. You can see the famous Eiffel Tower collapse and be reduced to rubble. Some Asian country unfortunately got hit also by the meteorite shower. It hits all the places it can possibly hit. But, that's not it. Wait until you see their perilous journey through space. The effects were outstanding. I have to say, though I am not a scientist, the planets, asteroids, comets, meteors and all that Heavenly stuff were accurately visualized. Another pro is that they blended all the genres successfully. One scene gives you a taste of intense action, another gives you a tearful of drama and on the other hand you'll laugh at the witty comments and one-liners. It was blended well. The actors were very good too. Bruce Willis gives an excellent portrayal as the leader of the ragtag crew Harry Stamper. Billy Bob Thornton was great too. Though he is not in the frontlines, I can feel his character's feelings through his emotions. Other casts include Steve Buscemi as 'Rockhound', the genius of the team. Michael Clarke Duncan as 'Bear', the big, husking brute that's a force to reckon with. Owen Wilson's character (Oscar Choi, the Geologist) though died earlier than I expected gives off some witty one-liners that I can't forget. Ben Affleck, gives a good acting. Some parts of him in the movie were great, some were not. I dunno. I can't feel him in some of the scenes. But, that was SOME parts only. All in all great choice for a cast list.Sound score were top-notch. It gives you the mood that you are in space with them. The only con I noticed is a major plot loophole: Isn't it easier for NASA to train professional astronauts to drill than train expert core drillers to be astronauts? My 2 cents.Anyhoo, 7/10. Overall, job well done.",Armageddon
162,BadWebDiver,The way an action movie works,8,25 April 2002,"This is great fun escapist entertainment. What really makes it work, and what most professional critics don't seem to get, is the way the movie shows the events and situations without the characters sounding like they're self-consciously trying to deliver textbook dramatic theory. The credit should really go to the various performers for managing to make their characters **chat**!!!Particularly notable is the performances of Steve Buscemi as ""So what, are we getting hazard pay for this?"" Rockhound and Peter Stomare as the whacked-out cosmonaut. They are examples of giving a story personality, and not just playing by the book. Of course Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton as the leads also give their characters real punch and panache too. This is especially evident with the negotiation scene. ""None of them want to pay taxes again ... ever."" Sure, it's escapist fantasy, but the dialog and personality makes it come alive.Even Ben Affleck's gun-ho young heart-throb character is delivered with personality - including the widely-criticised animal cracker scene. It's important to remember that Affleck's character AJ is NOT meant to be a professional impersonator. He's just a deep-sea oil rigger who's casually goofing around with his girl. I think Affleck hits the characterization perfectly. (It certainly plays a lot better, with more personality and humor, than the equivalent heavy-handed sobbing melodrama of the bus-leaving scene in DEEP IMPACT!)Other scenes that shows why this film worked with the general public, and outstripped its competition are the casino and examination scenes. They give insights into the idiosyncrasies and traits of the individual characters, without them sounding as though they're reading their own character descriptions.Sure, this isn't going to qualify any viewer for rocket science, or help make the world a better place to live; but as professional escapist fictional mass entertainment, this really kicks some butt.",Armageddon
163,David_Frames,Blink and you'll miss it,2,11 November 2006,"Effectively a remake of the 1978 disaster Meteor, but that film reconstituted through the brain of two overwrought p*ss-artists, namely Jerry Bruckheimer  he who would unleash bangs on us for eternity and his top dollar whore, Michael Bay; not so much a director in the classic sense, more a mechanistic film machine with eyes. In fact if Bay hadn't been seen in public it would be easy enough to believe that his name was a synonym for a directing computer developed by Industrial Light & Magic; programmed to replicate the moves of great helmers like Stanley Kubrick and, er, Paul Anderson but lacking the human capacity for feeling that made those men such warm, intimate filmmakers. But Bay is a man and one with the worst directorial style ever known to 110 years of cinema patrons. His technique, if you're interested, involves substituting movement for drama, music video gloss for decent cinematography, incident for story and ciphers for characters. His co-conspirators, his editor and his composer, give their contractual all to ensuring that every one of his synthetically stylish shots are given at least 2 seconds of screen time and each bang, cant and crane-assisted close-up are accompanied by plenty of plastic pathos.""I don't want to close my eyes, I don't want to fall asleep"" sang Aerosmith's Steve Tyler in the hilariously titled tie-in single ""I don't want to miss a thing"" but you did, you did and you did. With an average shot length of just 0.4 seconds, your ability to watch Armageddon is a lottery based on your pattern of blinking. This is deliberate so that having only registered about 45 minutes of screen time in a single sitting, an audience would be forced to watch it several times. This is genius of course but that aside, this confected cacophonic jingoistic man meat has all the real entertainment value of a Vegetarian Sunday lunchwith no wine. NASA gets a lot of free advertising in this one but they'd have come off better if they'd released the Challenger Disaster looped, into cinemas.You can gain some fun from Armageddon though  play the drinking game. Take a shot of something really disgusting every time God is mentioned. You'll be dead about half an hour before the end, meaning you'll miss the climatic funeral scene AND the infamous ""he's got space dementia!"" line. How's that for two good reasons?",Armageddon
164,MickeyTheConstant,"Fun in places, not that dated, try it...",6,27 December 2018,"I recently watched this movie again. It had been many years since I last saw it and the wife had never so thought we would revisit it together. Firstly, just try not to overthink it. Yes, the plot makes no sense really, yep, scientifically it is most definitely incorrect and the acting and scripts are not great. It will never be thought of as Oscar winning material. It is though Saturday night easy watching and quite enjoyable and still worth a watch. It has not really dated too much. The film in my opinion is about 45 mins too long. The first half is the most enjoyable as we see the global killer asteroid heading towards earth and we meet the crew who must stop it. Bruce Willis gives a normal Bruce performance, Steve Buscemi is great fun and has the most laughs. Ben Afflecks 'AJ' the supposed hero is actually really annoying. It all actually just gets a bit tiring and boring when they actually get up in space and meet the comet, a fatal flaw in what is primarily a space movie. It gets a bit too loud and hectic and you kind of long for the end. Anyway, I still did enjoy rewatching it and so if your a bit younger and yet to see it, give it a whirl.

165,lotus_chief,Well that's two hours I'll never get back.....,1,19 January 2004,"My GOD this has to be one of the absolute worse movies I have EVER seen! Michael Bay is at it again with the 'all style and entirely NO substance' approach.  Its just AMAZING to me that so many big names were involved in this movie and its still THIS BAD!  Talk about asinine!  The whole plot is just ludicrous.an asteroid is coming towards Earth to destroy us all..the only people who could save us?  Oil drillers!  Train them until the absolute last possible day before this big rock hits us and send them up there like astronauts so they could dig into it, drop a nuke, get out of there and detonate the bomb.  This is where the person with sense would say, wouldn't the pieces from the explosion still hit Earth anyway?  Hark!  Bay & Co. have the answers to that one...detonate the nuke before you cross this boundary between it and Earth and the pieces should just miss our planet!  Are you KIDDING ME???I still can't believe this trash was even made.  And the fact that it made as much money as it did bewilders me.  There's escapist entertainment, that still somehow makes sense and is somehow logical, and then there's Armageddon, which is just too stupid and ridiculous to even NOT be taken seriously.  I knew what to expect going in, but its one of those things where you don't think it will ever be as bad as you think it would be.  In this case its even WORSE!  Just how in the hell did they manage to do that? Easy.  By having NO script and a load of talentless 'superstars' (i.e. Ben Affleck).  Ben Affleck was one of the most worthless, stupidest characters I've ever witnessed in a movie.  What was his purpose?.... to just mess everything up and be as inept as possible?  The acting was horrible, which doesn't help the fact that the 'script' is pure nonsense.  Everyone just took the idea of the world ending too calmly..giving Bruce Willis & Co (our 'heroes') ample and frequent times to complain and bicker to each other about stupidness.  Uh, we're here to save the world.maybe this isn't a good time?!?!?!  Could SOMEONE have a BIT of sense here?  Oh, there was the self-proclaimed genius, Steve Buscemi (what the hell was HE thinking??) who was the only logical one until he came down with 'space dementia'. WHAT????
This is the perfect example of a movie having all the fancy decorations and brand names to cover up its total idiocy.  What really got me was how the surface of this asteroid was as smooth as newly paved streets for everyone to just drive/stroll around so easily.  I can employ my suspension of disbelief but so far, but the Evel Knievel jump made by Affleck on the armadillo was THE LAST STRAW for me!  I said 'two hours' in my summary because that's how much of the 153 minute drivel of a movie I was able to tolerate before almost breaking my sacred player trying to get the rented DVD out of it (how I removed the disc from my player without breaking it is a mystery).  I didn't see the last half hour or so and I truly don't care to know/see what happens.  I have been scarred for life watching this garbage, though I'm still recuperating from the torturous experience.  From now on I now know to stay FAR FAR AWAY from Michael Bay movies..Pearl Harbor, Bad Boys 2, and now Armageddon???  This takes the cake.  Those were two precious hours of my life that I could never get back.  What a load of CRAP this was.. one of the top 10 WORST movies I've ever been so unfortunate to see.ZERO out of **** stars.",Armageddon
166,ryan_kuhn,Oil Drillers In Space? WHY?,5,13 February 2005,"File this movie under ""they put the entire budget into the special effects, not the story"" category. The special effects looks great. It is easy to mess up asteroids slamming into Earth, but Armegeddon takes care of that side of the equation well. Now, if only they put as much effort into the story, we'd have a good movie. As it is, it's a nice movie to look at, but a terrible movie to have to sit through. Who's bright idea was it to make deep-sea oil drillers the men who will save the world? I like Bruce Willis, but if our lives were in Hudson Hawke's hands, I'd immediately invest some time in parachute-less skydiving, I think I'd have a better shot of seeing the next day. Ben Affleck, I like him in certain roles, but again, I'm not looking to him to be the hero, especially one as emotionally dopey as he is in this film. Now Billy Bob Thornton, if he's running the mission, I'd feel a little better, though it was his idea to send oil drillers who have had no training in working in space on the mission, so maybe his decision making is questionable. I had problems with the movie's logic, which can be covered up with awe-inspiring effects, but the relentlessness of the stupefying plot was difficult to ignore. The ending is cliché in every sense of the word, and maybe one day we'll actually see a movie where the world ends because they sent a team of oil drillers into space! Ugh... what were they thinking? Why not send lawyers into space? At least, that would be a good start.",Armageddon
167,lagriff05,"This just goes too far sometimes, but it's good",7,16 June 2007,"I'll say it straight out, this movie let me down quite a lot. I wanted an epic badass of a film that would revolutionize the way I see movies. I got an epic behemoth of a film with more then ample doses of goofy monkeying around inserted sometimes at the most inappropriate of scenes. Bruce Willis stars in this movie along with Ben Afleck and Liv Tyler as two young lovers, and it's safe to say that there aren't too many complaints with the acting (although admittedly there were some weak spots there, too).No, my main problem with this movie is the comedy. Now, I'm all for comedy, but the directors of Armageddon didn't seem to be taking their own plot too seriously at some point. I was in awe at the utter stupidity of the characters in this movie, especially toward the second half of it, and specifically Rockhound (Steve Buscemi, who does do a very good job acting here anyway). We all need some lighthearted fun in our movies, but what we don't need is for the comedy to interfere with the dramatic parts of the movie, which it almost does a few times here. Rockhound's foolishness and monkeying around almost ruins several scenes and it doesn't fit with the whole theme of saving the Earth. Why did they even put the parts involving the stripper and then later the machine gun on the asteroid into the movie? It's safe to tell who we can all throw rocks at for ruining the movie. Why on earth is he so lenient about it? It makes no sense. I can say the same thing for most of the crew at the beginning, too, they seem awfully laid back for a bunch of guys about to go save the world. Bear was falling asleep and making comments about a hot girl during the teaching sessions. What? Like I said, I like comedy fine, but here it just hinders what would otherwise be a phenomenal movie.This movie is full of explosions (big explosions, too, we're not talking about little buildings. We're talking entire cities all at once here. That's epic.), romantic love scenes, and other action clichés. They're actually done quite well, until we get Rockhound or Bear making more dumbass jokes. The whole mishmash makes Armageddon look like a PARODY of the action genre at some points, and it hurts the score. A lot. If I were to see this movie without any prior knowledge of action movies, and having never seen one before this, I would get a flawed first impression of the genre. It's not quite to the level of Scary Movie and Date Movie, of course, but it's not an upstanding example of how to incorporate comedy into an action movie. See Die Hard 3 or The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly for that. Sorry, but Armageddon just goes too far overboard sometimes.No, I don't hate this movie though. I do like it quite a lot. It's great fun for a Saturday night with friends or if you've been drinking (lol). The ending scenes with Willis and Afleck are very touching, as are most of the scenes involving Liv Tyler. It's also got some extremely triumphant moments, and the explosions and special effects are amazingly done. Check out those skies toward the end! The scenes with Chick (Will Patton) and his ex-wife and son are extremely touching, and are the saving grace of the quieter parts of the movie. Beautiful. And like I mentioned before, it's EPIC. In all caps, too. There aren't many other movies like this that can touch it in epic-ness. Not even Die Hard or it's sequels are more epic than this monster of a film.Recommended to action fans who can stand stupidity in their movie-viewing. I'll be watching this one again, too.",Armageddon

That the Americans once again save the world and no other country in the world can do it, the fact that several major cities around the world is destroyed and milions are killed but in the US, only a small part of N.Y. is destroyed, because the Americans are the only real humans, to hell with the rest of us, the president giving speeches while we watch children playing, the roughnecks/ astronauts walking in slow-motion towards the camera, the scene where the roughnecks sing, the love scenes between Affleck and Tyler, Affleck, Tyler being reduced to a sobbing pathetic woman waiting for daddy and her boyfriend to come home, Bruce Wiilis crying, the American flag, the complete unrealism of the plot, the fact that Afflecks character is a complete moron and Bruce fires him but still wants him on the team that's suppose to save the world?? You name moronic storyline and its on the screen. And lets not forget the awful musical score that made me wanna puke all the time.I would like to see a spoof, where the oh so heroic, oh so perfect Americans tries to save the world but fails miserably and has to watch England or Norway save the world instead.In real life all the US ever does is going into war with the middle east and treat all Europeans with no exceptions as potential terrorists at the customs at US airports. Something they have done ever since 9/11.

She puts in a pretty convincing performance of a daughter concerned about both her father's and husband-to-be's quest in space.

Willis sets the tone in the beginning when he tees off a golf ball from his drilling platform at a Greenpeace boat. The plot is simple and compelling: Earth will be destroyed by an asteroid unless Willis and his crew, with some interesting astro & cosmonauts flying the ultra useful and dependable space shuttle(Peter Storer as a whacked out Russian cosmonaut, great), to drill a hole in the asteroid and blast it in two with a hydrogen bomb.Real basic stuff, good action and special effects and it's unpredictable. Eliminate the Ben Affleck - Liv Tyler love angle, she plays the boss's daughter, and the drecky song by Aerosmith, replace it with more action, and the movie would be 2x as good.

172,troy-manatunga,the greatness and the simplicity of this story will never be forgotten.,9,2 October 2012,"MAY CONTAIN SPOILERSThe term out of sight out of mind is relevant to this article. The simple fact of Armageddon not being spoken much of today justifies that. This being said, if one may question another; have you watched the movie Armageddon, 8 out of 10 certainly would shoot back with the reply ""Yes"".The song I don't want to miss a thing debuted at number one at the billboard top 100. Performed by Aerosmith, this song has been the largest hit the band has ever done. This was also the first time in 28 years that Aerosmith topped the billboard top 100 charts. What more is needed to elaborate the greatness of the movies soundtrack? Simply said, nothing!This critic was whistling this tune when the urge to relive the Armageddon experience sprung. Up until this point Armageddon was out of sight and out of mind but not forgotten. It is certain if this article is being read by this time one can still recall the movie. A selected few may even treat themselves to another viewing. Armageddon: The place where the final battle will be fought of good and evil (Ref www.dictionary.com)A certain interpretation of the above context was written into a screenplay by Jonathan Hensleigh and J.JAbrams. Both names well acknowledged in the film industry for their contributions. Collaborating with Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay this screenplay saw its way through to cinemas near you in 1998. Collectively the above names have given you the following titles. JUMANJI, DIE HARD, SUPER 8, LOST, THE ROCK, BAD BOYS, PEARL HARBOR, TOP GUN, CON AIR, PIRATES OF THE Caribbean & REMEMBER THE TITANS.A Michael Bay signature always has been his astute choice of sound tracks and his visual effects. Ranging from Armageddon, PEARL HARBOR & TRANSFORMERS this signature move is evident. Nominated for 4 Oscars at the Academy Awards in 1999 Armageddon stood out in the following categories. Best Sound, Best Music; Original Song, Best Effects; Visual Effects, Best Effects; Sound Effects Editing.The earth has 18 days left. Mankind is challenged with its worst nightmare; total annihilation. 65 million years ago historians and science suggests that a similar catastrophe wiped away the dinosaurs and all living things that roamed the earth. The earth as we know it is in direct course collision of an asteroid the size of Texas and the earth's last line of defense and its only line of defense is Harry Stamper(Bruce Willis) and his oil drillers. NASA has no choice but to send up two teams into space in order to save the earth. The short synopsis makes it sound a sci-fi that would drive away an audience that dislikes the genre. Armageddon is many other things over a base of sci-fi. This is a story of love, self realization and redemption that is enchantingly woven around a situation that personifies human emotions in times of adversity. Starring Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Billy Bob Thornton, Will Patton, Michael Clarke Duncan, Owen Wilson, Steve Buscemi, William Fichtner, Peter Stormare and Liv Tyler Armageddon could not have needed a better cast. The cast begins the journey apart with slight hints of connection between each other. Like two hands fitting perfectly into each other they move closer and knit into each other that each life lost on the rock is felt hard by the viewer. Each sacrifice made on the rock tugs on the viewer a little bit harder and may even force out a tear. Personal favorite of this critic would be the only main female cast member Liv Tyler. The trauma of watching the only family she knew going into space to save a world that she did not understand, the agony of knowing that only one of the men she loves is returning back to her and the joy of knowing that one is at least returning to her. An absolute ball of thread her emotional path is and the then 20 year old actress delivered without holding back. Bruce Willis as always does not disappoint the audience. A hint more of Owen Wilson could have been slightly more welcome to promote more comic relief. The lack of Wilson is filled in by Duncan and Buscemi who nails the deal.Opening on the 21st B day of Liv Tyler Armageddon is one of the greatest stories told by Michael Bay. Mixed reviews do fly in the vast ethos of critics which is obvious and is the norm. However the greatness and the simplicity of this story will never be forgotten. A must watch movie and for those unfortunate few that have missed out on this marvel ; add this to your movie bucket list.TITLE: Armageddon DIRECTED BY MICHAEL BAY STARRING: Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Billy Bob Thornton, Will Patton, Michael Clarke Duncan, Owen Wilson, Steve Buscemi, William Fichtner, Peter Stormare and Liv Tyler RATED: PG13 RATING: 09/10 RUNTIME: 151 MINUTES",Armageddon

From the opening scene we are bombarded with crazy New Yorkers whom you pray the meteors will hit and dysfunctional stereotypes that attempt a cross between comic relief and making you want to hang yourself.The only sense it makes is a realistic depiction of the way a tall building really stands up to impacts.This movie is an insult to drivel.

174,atzimo,An irritating joke with a ridiculous direction,1,21 May 2001,"If you are a rational person, you will go crazy when you watch Armageddon. This movie is way beyond the poetic justice of Science Fiction and sometimes I wonder how the studio approved such a script. I mean we are not talking about a B-movie here, this is a multi-million dollar project that was advertised as the Sci-Fi event of the decade.Apart from the craziness of sending a bunch of unqualified people on a mission to save the world, there is the well known Michael Bay celebration of the US military forces ('The Rock'). There's also a sad statement that the whole planet depends on USA to find a solution in a crisis. You see, this drilling thing is such a sophisticated procedure that all the nerd astronauts of the world are unable to perform, so Bruce Willis' 'American' oil drilling team were asked to save the day.But what's even more irritating than the script, is Michael Bay's direction. He behaves as someone who's just learned all those cool trick shots and tries to show them off through the entire movie. There isn't one static shot in the movie! Literally! When he's zooming in to a character he uses those trademark Spielberg/Rodriguez techniques and he doesn't know where to stop. Those shots should be used in order to emphasize a line or a critical moment, but he does this all the time! The whole thing is like an enormous music video and after some time it becomes really bothersome.Just a few days before Michael Bay's US military trilogy is completed with the official screening of 'Pearl Harbor' I have one thing to ask: How can a cult personality like Steve Buscemi star in Armageddon?",Armageddon
175,Barky44,My #1 Most Despised Film of All Time,1,26 January 2004,"I absolutely hate Armageddon with every fiber of my being. This is probably not the worst movie ever made, but when considering the budget, the number of big stars, and the shameless over-promotion it is dollar-for-dollar the most despicable.The action is way over the top, it is wholly unrealistic, the characters are not at all interesting, even the special effects can only be marked as sub-par (especially when considering the budget of this film). It's just one lame gag after another. ""Oh my God, I dropped a screw! The entire mission is doomed"" over and over and over again until you find yourself wishing the mission would indeed end in a spectacular fireball just to put the film out of it's own misery!Unlike it's counterpart Deep Impact, these filmmakers don't even bother to showcase the human element of this story, how the potential end of the world effects society or even the characters involved. It's all about the father who feels like a failure; the girl who pines for her loser boyfriend; and the various psychotic episodes of the rest of the characters. Never do we even get the sense that these people care that the world is about to end. It's this lack of caring about humanity that boils out of the screen: the filmmakers didn't even like their audience. This isn't even a case of a good screenplay idea poorly executed (like Deep Impact), but the writers and filmmakers simply didn't bother to make a good film.This film will always sit at the top of my Most Hated List.",Armageddon

All characters were superbly cast. Buscemi as Rock, Affleck as AJ, Tyler as Grace, Thornton as Truman. All of them work well together and showed a very great chemistry, The relationship between Bruce and Affleck was simply put ""Great"" Thornton does a perfect job as a NASA employee. Their character just fit them. An asteroid the size of Texas is detected heading for Earth. It will wipe out all life on the planet if it hits. NASA decides that the only course of action is to plant a nuclear warhead deep into the asteroid to split it in two hoping it will safely pass Earth. They send a team of oil drillers led by Bruce Willis to drill the hole and save the Earth.This is a great disaster movie utilizing the directing skills of Michael Bay, a great action movie director and when teamed with producer Jerry Bruckheimer they create some of the best action films around. The effects in this film are incredible with an out of this world story line and a cast of greats that includes Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Owen Wilson, Steve Buscemi, Michael Clarke Duncan, William Fichtner & Will Patton. All great actors and all bring so much to the film, but the greatest performance is by Steve Buscemi who steals every scene he is in playing the character of Rockhound.This is an effects heavy film, but it works. The film is about chaos and destruction and the effects are relentless in the portrayal of the destruction. The spectacle of smaller asteroids crashing down to Earth is amazing to watch. Many people were put off with the effects of chaos and mayhem, but the film wouldn't have worked without it. However this film manages something most sci-fi films fail in. It manages to get you emotionally involved. I know many people that got teary eyed at the end of the film (me included) and that is something rare in a sci- fi/action film.Love it or Hate it, but this is a very emotional film especially with the Soundtrack and the last scenes.

An asteroid the size of Texas is about to do to us what another big rock did to the dinosaurs millions of years back (as we are told by Charlton ""Moses"" Heston in the opening credits). Swedish Peter Stormare -who steals every scene he's in as a russian cosmonaut- said to the media after seeing the final version of ""Armageddon"" that ""They cut out all the good parts!"", and apparently ever since he has tried to forget he ever involved himself in this project. The movie sure looks like they left hours on the cutting room floor, but if you just don't think too much about it what's left still makes for good friday night entertainment. Buscemi is once again left with all the smart remarks. He even does an homage to Slim Pickens in ""Dr Strangelove""! Only big quibble; watching the whole shabang makes the tagline ""For love. For honor. For mankind."" seem laughable and stupid. Sure, it ""moves"" our feelings a bit towards the end but how serious can a film like this take itself ? We're talking about a movie where oil drillers from mother Earth play Evil Knievel on an asteroid as it closes in on a head-on collision with earth! One plus; for the first time in years a movie about a crisis involving the whole planet actually shows several scenes from the WHOLE PLANET (like India, France, etc) instead of just pretending that the US is the centre of the universe.

It was the most spectacular film I'd ever seen and it still is one of the most spectacular to ever come out. Is it a masterpiece? Yes and no. You can't compare it with mind-enriching pieces of cinematic art like Fight Club or Requiem For A Dream but it does stand out in the, relatively mindless, action genre. It does everything what an action film is required to do and more. And therefore it's an action masterpiece. It's also Michael Bay's best, though Bad Boy is my favorite Bay movie.Armageddon gives you the two-hour adrenaline rush that you wanted when walking into the theater to go see an action flick. The acting and script is definitely extraordinary for an action movie. Okay, it's not excellent but it's better than 75% of all action movies that come out, even to this day. Billy Bob Thornton and Steve Buscemi in particular did a great job and this movie wouldn't have been the same without them.I'm not going to reveal anything about the plot since I don't want to include any spoilers in my comment.

Obviously, this is the type of movie to put your brain in neutral, and just enjoy it for what it is.Willis manages a crew of misfits that can best be described as ""motley"". Billy Bob Thornton does very well as the sober, earnest NASA mission controller. The action is excellent, and the tension is palpable as this motley crew races against the clock, and fights off deadly elements to save the world.This is very well done, and you end up rooting for this bunch, and get a huge lump in your throat at the end.

The level-headed comments deriding this movie clearly  state why this movie is so awful.  The ridiculous plot.  The cruddy visuals.  The crummy acting. The jackhammer editing.  Good God, that Aerosmith song.  In short, the unrelenting bombast of it all is what we object to.

Everyone who enjoys this movie by successfully removing their brains must have encephala minuscule enough to fit in that jean mini-pocket that won't hold much more than a subway token and a dime bag.

I wonder if they can actually feel their brains rotting as the movie drags on and on.May I recommend LAST NIGHT if you dig end-of-the-world stories?

Michael Bay is a low-key real life Supervillian, killing you slowly, one pixel at a time. Roger Ebert, in one his most dead-accurate assessments, called this movie a two-and-a-half hour trailer. Flash, bang, noise. Meaningless. Even for Autistic children this would be challenging - mentally challenging. Our heroes, who work on an oil rig, have to blow up a meteor hurtling towards the earth, cue training montage, challenges to overcome, one of the guys heroically sacrifices himself to save the world and they blow it up at literally the last possible second - this is a Saturday morning cartoon made into a 2 1/2 hour live-action C.G.I. husk.

What plot there is involves Willis & his goons REPLACING NASA ASTRONAUTS (who were all ""un-cool"")to fly space shuttles to land on a meteor that's headed to earth, drill into it, and detonate a nuclear warhead.  Oh, and get home in time to save the soppy, needless romance between an obnoxious Ben Affleck(""Mall Rats"") & a pouty Liv Tyler(aging hair-rocker Steve Tyler's talentless daughter).  All of this is crammed together with moore unnecessary explosions, moore shameless flag-waving, and moore cheesy, embarassing Aerosmith tunes than I thought was humanly possibe.  This laughable, moronic plot is so wafer-thin it makes Kate Moss look like 350 lbs of buttered lard.  :=8P  All the characters are vague, non-dimentional cliches spouting incredulous, lousy dialogue: they are about as rich and alive as a rotting mollusk(which might explain the film's vivid scent...).  The only actor able to breathe any kind of life into their pitiful roles is Bruce Willis, whose performance ranges from smarmy, self-affecting smugness to over-the-top, unintentionally hilarious. No one else even registers, especially the vaccuous Tyler.  Of course, we're all really here for the eye-candy, right??  Who cares about rich characters, engaging dialogue, or a compelling plot, when Hollybore gives us Shiny Thing Go Boom?  Well, Bruckheimer gives us Shiny Thing Go Boom ad nauseum.  Many things in ""Armageddon"" blow up for no udder reason that to squeeze in one moore explosion to up the ""Ooh-Ahh"" quotient.  For example, there's one obvious, needless plot device involving a drunk Russian(ooh that's original) & a space platform which blows up just so we can see it blow up.  Aside from the overwhelming noise and amount of explosions, the fx were pretty poor - just exactly how does a multi-billion dollar piece of precision engineering, which is grounded when 1 tile falls off in reality, fly through a hail storm of meteor debris?  The MooCow has not seen such shameless, jingoistic flag-waving since ""Red Dawn"", during the Evil Red Empire-Reagan days.  The film's message is blatant: America is #1, all other countries should bow down before us & pray that we save their worthless butts.  It's hard to believe that such an ""ugly American"" film would go over well in udder countries.  The cheesy, vomit-inducing Aerosmith moosic is a constant irritant, and a lame attempt to curry favor with teens by connecting her with her famous father's hopelessly over-rated band. Overall, this cow hasn't seen such a high-priced, over-blown cow flop since ""Independence Day"" or ""Men in Black"", and this film is even worse.  The MooCow says don't waste yer time with this stink bomb. :=8P",Armageddon

Just like so many others have said in the past and in the present - this movie is about FUNNNN.  And that's it.  It is meant to entertain - nothing else.  I have seen this movie probably 10 or 15 times or so (cable - nothing else exciting to watch).  Something disturbed me though.  I was watching it last night (again) and something hit me.  It just didn't make any sense.  Maybe this is why some people are saying that this movie does not make any sense scientifically.  Okay - look.  **Spoiler Warning**  Now a reporter said that after the rock crosses the zero barrier - the rock would take 3 hours and 57 minutes until impact with the Earth.  Now when the rock is blown up by Harry just seconds before crossing the zero barrier, the NASA person says that the rock and I quote ""will miss Earth by 400 miles.""  Will someone please answer a question for me.  This rock - which was traveling at 2200 MPH as said by Dan Truman - How would the rock take 3 hours and 57 minutes to travel 400 miles when it crosses the zero barrier.  That seems impossible to me.

I love Caroline Kennedy in an unobsessed and platonic way unlike Ben Afflecks characters love for the Bosses Daughter. I conform to the Creators view of the odds in actual or simulated Moonfleet combat and I am not a maverick. I am very happy to find out that my Moon 168 Artevan has miniature golf.

I thought that was interesting. The only nuclear weapons on Heavenly bodies that I am aware of belong to the Creator who is in Alliance with America and Great Britain. I have said before that I am a friend of Israel and Saudi Arabia both nations are coincedently important to American Foreign Policy. The drastic measures needed to stop Global Warming that President Kennedy spoke of will be difficult for all Nations to come to terms with but face the problem we all must.

192,basilisksamuk,The Citizen Kane of guilty pleasures,9,3 March 2013,"If 1969 and the moon landings mean anything to you, if you like space hardware, if you dream of flying in the space shuttle, if you like to see things blow up frequently, if you are thrilled by backwards-ticking clocks that have to beaten before the bomb goes off, the world is doomed, there is no escape, if your love of these things is big enough to forgive a so-so script and several large plot holes that you could drive an asteroid the size of Texas through, then you'll love this film. I'm guilty on all charges.I knew this film was going to kick ass as soon as I heard the magisterial tone of Charlton Heston's voice-over at the beginning. When this was closely followed by a space shuttle being blown apart by asteroids and the destruction of large parts of an American city I was a very happy man. Even though I liked Deep Impact, this film is better – it destroys more things, more effectively in the first 10 minutes and thereafter grabs you by the throat and never lets go until the end credits.I will freely admit that one reason this film grabs my attention so much is the extensive use of the space shuttles and the excellent NASA footage and locations. It really gives an impression of what the shuttle is like, what a launch is like, how dangerous it is. Certainly liberties are taken and things speeded up such as a docking with Mir that happens so fast that in reality it would knock the station into an orbit with Saturn. There is also the slight matter of how a shuttle survives hitting several gazillion-ton asteroids but can have a whole wall blown out by a few bullets.Oh yes, the plot. Asteroid heading for Earth. Bruce Willis drills big holes for his oil company. US govt. hires Willis to dig hole and plant nuke on said asteroid. Willis recruits dirty dozen type misfits for mission. NASA training. Paranoid military types. BOOM. BANG. Backwards clocks. Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler provide lurve interest.The script shows signs of being written by committee and some of the one-liners fall flat. When I introduce the law to ban trailers I will also introduce a 50 year moratorium on speeches from American presidents who say they are doing something in co-operation with the whole world whilst in reality they use one comedy Russian in the whole thing and accidentally blow up Mir in the process. I will also order directors of further Doomed Earth films to find some different national monuments to represent the other nations of the earth.Anyway, these small gripes aside, I thoroughly recommend this film to anyone who, like me, enjoys brainless science fiction thrillers with loads of special effects and Bruce Willis in them. It is a sheer joy to watch and I shall be going back to see it again",Armageddon
193,Dar Star,Worst movie of the year,1,21 November 1998,"This dud was clearly one of the worst movies of the year. Forget the inconceivable premise of flying oil rig drillers into space to save the world (I'd think it would be easier to teach astronauts to drill than vice-versa), the testosterone level of the plot and script are way too high and serve to destroy any semblance of fear or tension about the impending destruction of Earth.

Such a disastrous scenario is indeed possible, and an emergency mission to blow up the meteor might be one way to fix it.But not like this. The Shuttle is given capabilities that are impossible. In fact, the whole mission is so full of bad science that it makes Spielberg look like Einstein. The only part that's believable is when Ben Affleck singlehandedly blows up the Russian space station. I believe he could really do that.There is far too much attempted humour; this is supposed to be the ultimate disaster movie, after all. Why did they think it needed to be funny as well? And then there is the usual Amero-centric viewpoint. Half of Asia gets blasted away. Wow, that was lucky, it could have been us.Did I mention clichés and stereotypes? This film is just about nothing but.Very expensive popcorn. If you haven't seen it yet, don't bother unless you know nothing at all about science.",Armageddon
195,TheEtherWalk,"Only so-so movie, but the FX are great!",4,17 November 2002,"The movie Armageddon is typical Jerry Bruckheimer fare. It combines a massive budget and plenty of special effects with an average script and semi-serious plot.Where do I begin? Armageddon is a lopsided movie. The premise is that an asteroid the size of Texas (?) is headed for earth and a team of oil drillers are employed to stop it. The movie sounds serious, but it is really a comedy.Most of the asteroid scene is an error because the only things they would be able to hear is each other's voices. There are too many sound effects on the asteroid to make it believable.The best parts of this movie are the visual effects which were outstanding and Steve Buscemi who provides comic relief as the hilarious Rockhound. The beginning scene in NYC is quite well done, but after that the plot seems to go downhill. How is it that the guys on the oil rig have not heard about the disaster in NY? And don't even get me started on the whole nuke-on-the-surface-wouldn't-work thing, because it probably would. That scene on the Russian space station was so far-fetched that it blows my mind. But again, that's most Jerry Bruckheimer movies.Then there is that whole manual-detonate thing at the end. Why didn't NASA think of that in the first place, rather than trying to detonate the bomb on the surface, killing the whole crew? This was a weak way to add drama to the script.The dialogue is funny in some parts, but in most scenes it is just stupid. That might have something to do with the fact that the movie had 9 WRITERS!!!Overall, I think people are too hard on judging this movie. People have given it 1 out of 4, and some people have given it 3 out of 4, but no one has given it 2 out of 4. So I will. I give it ** out of **** or 5/10.",Armageddon
196,groggo,Bay is a Schlockmeister,1,10 July 2007,"Dogme 95, with some exceptions, hasn't been a smashing success, but it's not hard to see how it developed, why Danish directors Lars von Trier, Thomas Winterberg and others waged open revolt over the theatre of the stupid that Michael Bay and too many other Hollywood schlockmeisters have been specializing in for far too long.I read in a Toronto newspaper a few weeks ago that the wildly deluded Bay considers himself an 'artist'. It was an amazing thing to say, and underlined how far his ego has been insulated from reality in that California dreamland from which he produces his consistently dreadful exercises in self-absorption. This guy specializes in ear-splitingly loud and obnoxious movies and promotes them with ear-splitingly loud and obnoxious comments, and then carries on, hopelessly oblivious to his legion of naysayers.If a cinematic 'artist' is defined by box-office receipts, by super-aggressive global marketing, Bay and his computer artists are Michelangelos. He makes mountains of dough, which might explain why actors want to work with him. Bay is no artist; he's a big-screen video game cartoonist whose narrative skills depend almost exclusively on computer wizardry and special effects. His knowledge of character, plot or anything else is all but non-existent, and these essential features of art are always sublimated -- worse, simply ignored -- in all his 'films'. In Armageddon, Bay's believability and credibility are non-existent. His redundancy quotient is a thing to behold. He batters you into submission, over and over again. If you don't get his 'point' the first time, wait five minutes and he'll come back again. His movies appeal to children and adult children who became addicted to video games 20 years ago and avoided the painful withdrawal of rehab.Almost 10 years after Armageddon, in 2007, Bay is offering us another pile of shlock called Transformers, yet another insult to anyone who sincerely believes in cinematic art. This same pile of schlock is, predictably, breaking all box-office records. Sad.Bay has made about seven or eight bloated, pretentious, pompous, self-important exercises in overkill, and not one of them is worth a serious review. Armageddon fits very well into his questionable canon. Warts and all, give me von Trier and gimmick-free artistic filmmakers anytime. Every time I see these kinds of non-films (and there are far too many of them), I look with even greater awe and appreciation at the cinematic work of Welles's Citizen Kane, completed 56 years before Armageddon hit the bobbleheaded, popcorn-munching masses. Bunuel, Murnau, Lang, Keaton, Chaplin, and many others were all making far greater magic with film 80 years ago, without a computer in sight. To have Bay insinuate himself as an 'artist' in this same company goes beyond insult.",Armageddon
197,metalrox_2000,What movie did you watch,1,23 March 2005,"Without a doubt Armagedden has to be one of the worst all star films since Ishtar. From Bruce WIllis sleepwalking through his role, to Liv Tyler's over-dramatic performance, this film almost falls into plan 9 from outer space territory, but with none of the campyness. This god awful turkey disproved one theory: You can make a really bad film, despite having Steve Buschemi in the cast. What we simply have is yet another big budgeted, Hollywood mistake. I honestly tried to give the movie a chance, but often found myself laughing and things that weren't intended to be funny. I'm a long time fan of sci fi flicks, and I've seen some really bad ones, but Armagedden takes it's rightful place in the dishonorable roll. Thankfully, there will be no sequel. Armagedden is another example of late 90's film making. A movie whose soundtrack was better then the film itself (example, Godzilla). Remove the ultra cheesy animal crackers track, the one with the spoken words of Aerosmith's I don't wanna miss a thing, and the soundtrack is great, even with the sham verison of Journey on the album. Unremarkable special effect, a script that appears to be have written during a drinking binge, and overwrought, and chew the scenery acting doom what could have really been a decent movie. Alas, yet again, we're stuck with another example of why Indy films do better then Hollywood.",Armageddon

199,axismladen,"A propaganda movie i can't help but like! I feel guilty for it, but...",8,4 October 2011,"I feel a bit disappointed in my self for liking this movie, since it's one of the biggest propaganda pictures of the last twenty years, but i just can't help it. It's a non stop action flick that puts a few A-listers and some best of the best B-listers in some very interesting situations happening in outer space.Directing and cinematography are music video like, as they always are in a Michael Bay movie, but music makes up for all of it. Aerosmith at it's best. Also, editing is quite good. The entire movie is well crafted and it's so hard not to like it weather you agree or disagree with some of the statements it presents. And writing, no matter how unoriginal it is, really takes the best from dumb science fiction movies and does a good job at putting it all together. Armaggedon is a big pile of overused Hollywood stuff, but the writer did a very good job with it and for that the movie is never boring or irritating in any way. And yeah, like i said, this is one of the biggest American Propaganda films of the last twenty years, but with all it's qualities i just can't help but love it. Even if those qualities are nowhere near to being original or fresh.As for the acting, the actors do quite good with their roles. Yes, even Ben Afleck. But the star of the film is still, as he is in any movie he's ever been in, Bruce Willis. He just looks natural in these bad guy with a heart of gold kind of roles. All the others did quite good as well, but like i said, Bruce really stands out. Even in a cast that's filled with good and popular names.American propaganda, yes! American propaganda at it's best, yes! I love it even though i hate all it stands for. Well, not all of it, but... I have nothing against patriotism, but i do have everything against movies that put one nation, America, in the savior of the world part and put it above everyone else. But i guess they tried to cover it up with a good hearted crazy Russian guy so i'll be forgiving this time and just enjoy the movie as interesting as it is, no matter what it's flaws are. And yes, you heard me right, the Russian guy is actually a good guy instead of a terrorist or anything like it. And he wants to come back to his Mother Russia as a hero! :)",Armageddon

The situation, as always, elevates the misfits over the mindless bureaucrats who reluctantly have to turn to them.Bruce Willis is Harry Stamper, the world's best oil driller. He is called upon by NASA, in the persona of Billy Bob Thornton (Dan Truman), the red-tape cutter who assembles our heroes. Keith David (Lt. Gen. Kimsey) plays to type as a Colin Powell clone whose orders are to destroy the mission whenever possible, while William Fichtner is Col. Sharp, a bureaucrat at heart who still thinks when necessary. Stamper's crew includes the men from his oil company, an ensemble of Ben Affleck (A.J., his future son-in-law), Michael Clarke Duncan (""Papa Bear,"" a jolly black Giant), Ken Hudson ""Quiznos Baby Bob"" Campbell (Max, a grown up, dumbed down version of Bob), Owen Wilson (Oscar, the space-cadet geologist), Steve Buschemi (""Rockhound,"" and the guy you know your daughter will talk to despite your warnings), and Will Patton (Chick). These men have worked together for years and are like family.The ""armageddon"" project is based on current events, namely the realization that it's only a matter of time before earth is struck yet again, with most life forms not surviving. In the movie, there is 17 days to train the crew, fly them to the asteroid, and have them drill an 800 foot hole, into which a nuclear warhead is detonated, hopefully splitting the asteroid. Along the way, they pick up Peter Stormare (Lev), the Russian space station cosmonaut who gives the mission its international flavor, while reminding us that Russian astronauts are superior to American oil drillers.The cinematography is what makes the film work. The plot plays out very predictably, as most movies of this type do.

The asteroid was the best character, it beat the humans hands down! It had the most wicked landscape (check out its pointy tails!!) You also get to hear the asteroid growl when it begins to break up.
WARNING: A SPOILER HAS BEEN DETECTED IN THE VICINITY!Lots and lots of S.F.X. At least two thirds of this flicks' special effects are dedicated to the asteroid, the real star of this film! I did like the way the guy at the beginning asked to have the asteroid named after his wife. She does the fingers at him. We also have Mr Stamper running around an oil rig blasting a shotgun at his daughter's hero boyfriend for sleeping with her on the job. An OIL RIG??? This scene should've been omitted!My complaint: The romantic sub plot. It was unnecessary and simply slowed the pace. The worst scene I've ever seen in an action movie was the aptly named 'Animal Cracker Scene'. It spoilt the movie and made me physically cringe. The pretty 'bedroom interest' was a typical cliched female, sitting at home waiting for her boyfriend to come in the door. She served no other purpose!  CONCLUSION?

The opening credit sequence was really crap, it's the same ""Genesis"" sequence in Star Trek II - The Wrath of Khan. The excessively edited movie looks like it was trimmed frantically by Edward Scissorhands stoned on cocaine laced with meth and crack. The obnoxious and loud soundtrack gave me a pounding headache. Some certain scenes in Armageddon looked like it was a commercial shoot. The U.S. flag-waving glory while dissing the third-world regions is very cynical and insulting. I won't even elaborate about the utter lack of scientific accuracies that caused the disbelief and totally insulted my intelligence.Overall, Armageddon is another stale and repetitive popcorn movie fare churned out from the BS Hollywood machine to make the quick bucks on purpose. IMDb has proved that there are the total of 9 writers who contributed to this P.O.S. movie, which is a total waste of the writing talents who sacrificed themselves for greed. The question is, will there be more like this? Possibly.Because the domestic audiences with short-attention span and the low I.Q. demands it.

This movie could not figure out what it wanted to be. An epic story of saving mankind or a slapstick comedy. Trying to be both, it missed the mark.Thanks to the fantastic cast, not all was lost. But it seemed like a big-budget variation of a SyFy channel movie. The ""special effects"" were way overdone and beyond any possible semblance of the realm of reality. The idea that a band of oil rigging roughnecks could learn to fly a spaceship in a few days is an insult to everyone in the space program. The idea that we could land a spaceship going 22,500 mph on a meteor moving 22,500 mph is beyond ludicrous.

It stole an awful lot from ""Deep Impact"" which I gave **1/2 out **** to because it was also boring, but smarter.  I actually counted how long most of the scenes lasted.  Two seconds.  Michael Bay did a p***-poor job with this film.  Most of the characters I forgot were even there.  They say two lines of dialogue, then just roam around until they get killed.  Too many characters to keep track of.  I liked Godzilla because it has something to work with, and it was actually exciting.  This film was way too long and way too boring.

216,Cephyran,"Campy, occasionally romantic...",8,13 September 2004,"Reading a lot of other reviews, I get the sense this movie isn't very popular. Granted it's got a fairly star studded cast - Bruce Willis, Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck, Steve Buscemi, Michael Clarke Duncan, and all those other familiar faces you know you've seen before. That could be one of the film's faults - they stocked their hopes on a popular cast, and didn't pay enough attention to the plot itself. As far as plot, I'm always entertained by disaster movies, particularly the disaster part. For me, the best part of the movie is the foreboding atmosphere built up by the superficial damage that the tiny fragments create. Everything after that is just filler. At the same time, I personally feel the one other strong point is the romance between Tyler and Affleck, and the conflict they have trying to build their relationship around the cynical father, Willis. That's a guilty pleasure of mine - a sweet romantic story thrown in peril by extenuating circumstances. Overall, it's a satisfactory effort at film-making. Armageddon is campy action-fun, the kind of movie made for a rainy Friday night or Saturday afternoon.",Armageddon

I recently got to see the movie on TV and I was very much entertained. As a fan of space and NASA, I found that Armageddon did deliver as a space-end of the world movie that all could enjoy. However, it did have some flaws, For one, this movie was a mix of comedy and action and I believe that it should have stuck with action/disaster film and not really a comedy. Finally, I do think it is cool that Steven Tyler's daughter Liv was in the movie but I do think she deserved a somewhat better role than the daughter/girlfriend.

225,charlessmith702210,"This movie might rival ""The Day After Tomorrow"" and ""Independence Day""",9,6 May 2007,"This is slightly better than ""Deep Impact."" The basic concept of ""Armageddon"" comes a little bit too late in the beginning, but it is clear that the earth will be meeting up with the biggest asteroid NASA had seen in decades. Knowing that the asteroid will mean the near total destruction of earth if it hits, NASA makes up a big plan that will involve even people who were not from NASA, including Harry Stamper, a long-time oil drill worker, who was picked for this wild mission. At that point, he was engaged to Gracie and planned to get married after the mission.The mission to keep the asteroid from knocking out earth was simple-- two teams will land on the asteroid, drill a hole in it, and put a nuclear bomb on it.But the bomb has to be on remote detonation mode, and this detonation must occur within about 300 miles (the imaginary zero barrier) from earth. If unsuccessful, Earth would not be as extant as it is now.The first step was for the crew to meet up at the Space Station around 120 miles from earth. They do and meet at least one cosmonaut, but a broken fuel line causes a backdraft explosion of most of the space station--but fortunately, the crew gets back to the shuttle before they all die.The second step was for the two space shuttles, Independence and Freedom, to go around the asteroid in space, and try to make one of the toughest landings ever in space history. In addition, the moon truck called The Armadillo would be used to assist in the drilling of the bomb.After dealing with the landings, the hard work begins. Soon there is a problem about the remote detonator; one team member wants to blow it up soon; another says he must dismantle the bomb so it won't go off. NASA officials do override the detonation of the bomb but only for a short time. Then the bomb rearms itself and then it was up to the team to disarm the bomb, but it was done.A rock storm almost completely destroys the team's drilling of the rock to put in the bomb, but Stamper loses one of his men. But even worse, he finds out that the remote detonator for the nuclear bomb is out of action.All of the focus as the big asteroid approaches Earth was on the AVHRR, or the Advanced Very High Resolution Radiograph. The AVHRR tracks the asteroid approaching zero barrier--that is, once the asteroid passes it, no nuclear explosion or anything else will keep that asteroid from hitting earth with devastating results.Then, a conflict between AJ (played by Ben Affleck) and Stamper, because Stamper's fiancée, Gracie (Liv Tyler), can only watch this daring mission. The crew decides to draw straws to find out who will hold the bomb and blow up the bomb manually and give up one's life on the asteroid rock. Stamper almost refuses to do the task---and AJ decides to sacrifice his life to blow up the nuke--but at the very last moment, Stamper forces AJ out of the task, deciding that he will do the sacrificial task.Stamper then gives the extremely bad news to Gracie in space; their marriage plans are now irreversibly gone, and Gracie cries at his last words. NASA observers then feast their eyes in awe at the approaching asteroid. As Stamper was about to detonate the nuke, the other team members re-fire the shuttle engines but they find out that the shuttle can't blast off from the big rock. The team works quickly because if they can't get out fast, the shuttle will burn up in the earth's atmosphere on the rock, meaning death for all of them. Then a cosmonaut fumes over the engine breakdown and slams on the engine's controls several times and then, they hear a sound the team loves to hear...the engine finally starts, and the team blast the shuttle away from the rock just in time--about 2 minutes before the rock hits the zero barrier.Stamper himself then faces a new problem--still another rock storm, almost knocks him unconscious. But he gets up, gets the bomb control ready, and saying his last words in honor of Gracie, he manually presses the button---and then---he does it! Stamper dies as the bomb blows...the surviving shuttle team sees a bright flash that signals to them that Stamper had gave his life... and the bomb does its job...breaking up the asteroid into two halves just about 1 mile before the breach of the zero barrier.But all of this success came too late for the people of the South Pacific and Paris, who got hit hard by smaller asteroids that were the precursor of the biggest asteroid, causing massive destruction and thousands of deaths. That asteroid reminds me of something like a punishment by God for all the sins people make on earth.",Armageddon
226,Mario64,A poor special effect no brainer,3,4 April 1999,"Armageddon is without a doubt the worst movie I seen in 1998 (note: I didn't see The Waterboy, I still know What You Did Last Summer or others that could possibly top it as the worst). This is the basic stupid summer action movie that has a weak plot, poorly acted character, and dumb blurs of special effects. An asteroid is going to destroy earth, oh wow (a very sarcastic wow). The character aren't any better. If these guys were actually the top drilling team on earth they would be smarter and mess up a lot less than they do in this movie. And now the special effects. The simple thing is that half the special effects you can't understand what's happening and the other half they go by without any meaning.All in all I was disappointed in this movie.

Some movies I've seen such as Face/Off and The Mummy were able to, despite their script and plot problems, be at a fun entertaining level enough to make up for their faults. Armageddon fails with action scenes that make no sense, have way to high a frequency of cuts, and are just messy and too loud. If a movie is made purely for eye candy it shouldn't taste like dirt.

228,sbox,Way Too Much Action Dooms Interesting Screenplay,5,3 October 1999,"[WARNING:  This review may contain ""spoilers.""]Given that the Earth has but mere days to exist, NASA elects to go with a crew of Texas roughnecks to save the day.  Actually, NASA doesn't really have a choice.  They need a team of drillers who can operate anywhere, in the harshest of conditions.  Engineers, astronauts, and pilots are very skilled and knowledgeable in their fields, but they don't know diddly about drilling.This really was a wonderful opportunity to highlight the abilities of unsung men who have technical capabilities, rarely highlighted in Hollywood films. It is also interesting to see how NASA wrangles with the construction crews' various legal, medical, and psychological problems.  For example, ""Bear,"" the biggest and strongest of the bunch jumps into an impromptu flex after being told by a NASA egghead how awful his cholesterol is.  Its pretty clear that if these boys are going to save the world, the planners are going to have to take a back seat to knowledge and knowhow.If the film had stuck with this premise it would have scored big.  Alas, ""Armageddon"" trades in its refreshing approach and adopts the cheesy, stale, over the top, Hollywood sanctioned industry explosion as its plot mover. What a waste!  Not ten minutes goes buy in the second half of this movie, in which something isn't bursting apart, a la, ""Independence Day.""  By the time the ending comes around and one of the crew elects to do a heroic act, it winds up meaningless.  Too much anxiety has already been built up and torn down again, by mindless explosions in outer space.This movie suffers the same fate as ""The Phantom Menace.""  When you shoot for the 12 year old boy in the audience you will almost always get his attention.  However, Hollywood should ask itself a question.  Is that tried and true formula for box office success worth it in the long run?  Is it really worth tossing good screenplays to the wind for the sake of slow motion , computer generated effects?  If this film did not have the explosions every minute, it would have scored high.  As it is, I give it a generous five out of ten.",Armageddon

I didn't flunk it because I had to admit that it was entertaining fun, but at the time I was miffed by the fact that it was a ridiculously, absurdly exaggerated plot, blatantly manipulative and without the faintest shade of seriousness, verisimilitude or believability. And directed like an MTV video, as you would expect from Bay. God forgive me, I even remember saying I preferred Deep Impact!A couple of years later and after seeing it two or three more times, all those things that I saw as defects I now consider as its virtues. Precisely because it dispenses completely with believability and is played continuously and exclusively for kicks, is why I love it so much now.

232,Wulfstan10,Less than Mediocre,4,15 March 2005,"This film simply is not good. It is far from the worst film I have ever seen, but it is simply mindless entertainment, a fact which even most of those praising it admit. This alone does not make a bad film, as not every film has to be deep or insightful, but this movie is extremely mindless and in order to succeed as entertainment it must be pulled off really well. This film is not.The basic plot is, needless to say, not original. Again, while originality alone is not necessary for a good film, it is just one of many things wrong with it. The lack of originality is hit home by the fact that Deep Impact, exploring the same issue, came out about the same time (and, I think, is a much better film).The film is, moreover, thoroughly predictable. The story, the characters, and the ending are all predictable. The only exceptions are actually worse than predictability because they involve events or apparent jokes that are either tasteless and inane, or surprising simply because they seem completely out of place and inappropriate (see below).The acting, events, and development of the plot range from mediocre to simply inane, with stupid people in places they shouldn't be, and people doing utterly moronic things at utterly inappropriate times. Apparently, some of these elements seem to have been designed for humour, but they come across as just stupid and out of place. Other bits of humour are simply crude and tasteless.In short, this film lacked in pretty much every aspect: intelligence, originality, predictability, development, etc. Thus, even for pure entertainment ""disaster"" films, it simply does not shine at all and is a mediocre production even among mindless films. The result is quite boring and not worth the time. It did not fail uniformly terribly in all aspects, though, and there are many much worse films out there.",Armageddon
233,TimBoHannon,Does Michael Bay Want to Hurt Us?,2,12 November 2018,"I felt an unpleasant, adrenaline-like sensation during much of the runtime of ""Armageddon."" That feeling was not from thrill, delight, joy or entertainment. It was rooted in anxiety. This movie was made to combat alcoholic hangovers. If some genius makes this an in-flight movie, such person should be arrested for violating the Eighth Amendment.I propose a new law--no more ""Meteors Heading for Earth"" movies. ""Meteor"" focused on the diplomatic aspect and failed to entertain while ""Deep Impact"" highlighted the plight of a few dysfunctional people on Earth. That latter is so painful to watch that I wished the meteor would hit quickly so we could all get on to more enjoyable tasks such as catheterizing ourselves.After a comet plays bowling ball with the Asteroid Belt, several displaced rocks reach Earth, conveniently hitting only our largest cities. I call them homing space rocks. Yes, it is a *comet*. NASA uses the term meteor, but meteors are smaller than asteroids. Meanwhile, trouble is brewing on Harry S. Stamper's (Bruce Willis) offshore oil platform. When he finds his daughter (Liv Tyler) in bed with A.J. (Ben Affleck), he chases A.J. around the facility with a shotgun. Apparently he is not aware of what happens if his shot penetrates an oil pipe.NASA director Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton), who should switch last names with Stamper, selects Harry and his crew to drill a hole in the *comet* and insert a nuclear bomb to split it and deflect the two halves away from Earth. Harry and his crew (including Will Patton, Michael Clarke Duncan, Steve Buscemi, Owen Wilson and Ken Hudson Campbell) learn to be astronauts in 12 days. While the training scenes last far too long, they are the most interesting part of the movie. The shuttle is piloted by William Sharp (William Fichtner) and Jennifer Watts (Jessica Steen). A Russian cosmonaut (Peter Stormare) joins the party when they refuel.Boring and annoying describe the movie's first half, but once they enter space, the assault begins. Upon landing, the crew discovers that the *comet* is prone to earthquakes. The smaller the solar body, the more unstable the tectonic plates, I suppose. In any case, a lot of commotion and destruction ensues. Director Michael Bay creates and edits it as aggressively as possible. Different shots are strung together at incredible speeds while lights flash and an extreme amount of sparks fly. The acting mainly consists of people shouting at each other and running around in near-panic while the music raises the hyper-scale to maximum. ""She's gonna blow,"" ""the clock is ticking"" and ""we have no time"" dominate the dialogue. Only Stormare and Thornton stay calm enough to act well throughout; others have their moments, but not many.What equipment NASA has created! The shuttles, ground vehicles and space suits are apparently made of flexible diamond. They take repeated beatings but remain in fine working condition, except when the script calls for something to blow up. Amazingly, Sharp has trouble disarming his own bomb, which only reminded me of a better scene in the video game ""Max Payne.""""Armageddon"" may be Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay's answer to ""Independence Day,"" but they forget that ID4's main strength was that it spent more time resting than moving. Bay tried for a stand-up-and-cheer ending, but 150 minutes of loud, hostile movie-making does not give me the urge to cheer for anything. ""Armageddon"" is the definition for ""sound and fury signifying nothing.""",Armageddon
234,Mike Astill,Pitiful,1,5 February 2002,"One of those annoyingly overblown films that is far more popular than it has a right to be, this syrupy rubbish succeeded in stealing much of the thunder of the superior Deep Impact. Earth is doomed, and only a group of overbearing Yanks can save us. They're a collection of rogues, criminals, perverts and potential psychos, but they can drill holes well so they're our only hope. Cue a collection of hysterical (!) scenes as they're trained to be astronauts, then shot into space to destroy an oncoming asteroid that's the size of Texas.Bay and Bruckheimer are never names that suggest subtlety or good taste, and true to form after an admittedly impressive opener the movie soon descends into a mess of overly plush special effects and saccharine sentimentality, not least when the doomed inhabitants of Earth gather around their most photogenic national monuments to stare sorrowfully at the sky. No cliché is left unused, no opportunity for a heartfelt dialogue is avoided; these people truly have no shame. The impressive cast is not even worth mentioning. They rattle off the dialogue as if it was written ten minutes before the cameras started rolling. Buscemi in particular was wasted, and it's a sad day when a Bruce Willis character is not even the slightest bit appealing.
Quick cuts and confusing camera angles shouldn't be allowed to cover what is essentially shoddy filmmaking. One day the people who make these films successful will realise what they've been doing. I hope they can live with themselves.",Armageddon

Unfortunately, I got dragged to this at the multiplex, and my fears were more than justified. ""Armageddon"" is as bad as big-time blockbusters can get. It's no fun to rip it, really - it's just too easy of a target. What bugs me is all the self-righteous comments on IMDB from users trying to justify their own low, low, LOW standards to discriminating moviegoers like myself.
There is something called ""suspension of disbelief"" that is the basis for enjoying films or plays. It means that the creators attempt to present a story in a reasonably plausible fashion, in order to allow the audience to forget they are watching something fictional and react as if the events were actually occurring. THAT is why this movie is so hated - it makes no pretense of believability or originality, it just tries to beat you into submission. When I am paying $9 to see a movie that cost more than $100 million, I should not have to turn off my brain to get my money's worth.
 Check out some of the classic action movies, like ""Road Warrior"", ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", the original ""Terminator"", or, more recently, ""Braveheart"", and you will see the difference. None of these films is exactly a documentary, yet they manage to entertain without assaulting the viewer.",Armageddon

This movie isn't trying to be APOLLO 13, or anything like that. It's supposed to be entertaining, which I thought it was. I didn't see DEEP IMPACT yet, so I can not compare the two, but I thought ARMAGEDDON was a great film.An asteroid the size of Texas is heading straight for the planet Earth. When it hits, everything on the planet, even bacteria, will die. NASA, in a desperate attempt to save the planet, calls Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis), an expert driller, and his elite driller group of unlikely heroes (includes Will Patton, Steve Buscemi, Michael Duncan) to go on a mission to drill a hole in the asteroid, place explosives in it and destroy it before it hits Earth. A.J. (Ben Affleck), who is engaged to Harry's daughter Grace (Liv Tyler), struggles to earn his respect. Nothing on the asteroid goes as planned, and the survivors of the team must work together to save the planet.The plot doesn't have realism going for it, but it does have some great entertainment and special effects. This is probably the ultimate summer movie smash! The acting is pretty good too. Bruce Willis, Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck and Billy Bob Thornton all do a terrific job.

Although it wasn't great, Armageddon entertained me to the max, which made it for me not to enjoy.At the obligatory scientific-military crisis conflab with NASA's director (Billy Bob Thornton) we get a refresher course in extermination events. This particular cosmic uh-oh, Asteroid Dottie, is the size of Texas and will hit planet Earth in 18 days, leaving not even a bacterium alive. Our only hope is for a rock rendezvous mission to drill a hole deep into the sucker and nuke it at the core. Hence the urgent need to locate ""the world's best deep-core driller"". Cue Bruce Willis as Harry Stamper, a rowdy, globe-trotting maverick inspired by famed oil well firefighter Red Adair. Harry graciously agrees to save the world - like ya do - but only if he can take his own team with him. Enter a ragtag bag of roughneck, rambunctious and ex-criminal cowboys who include Harry's calm best buddy (Will Patton), a gigantic muscleman Ving Rhames lookalike (Michael Clarke Duncan), a Zen-babbling young dude Matthew McConaughey lookalike (Owen Wilson), the handsome reckless stud (Ben Affleck) - who's in love with Harry's gorgeous, headstrong daughter (Liv Tyler) - and a wisecracking weirdo genius geologist (it could only be Steve Buscemi).Armageddon gets more exciting, more intense every second, every minute. The actors are all fine, Bruce Willis is great as Harry, Ben Affleck is an excellent supporter and Liv Tyler is beautiful. She is the stand-out of Armageddon, her performance being Oscar-worthy and all The direction was also impressive, especially for a guy I have quite frankly never heard of! The only thing that needs a little work is the screenplay, which seems rushed at times, and silly at others.Armageddon is an entertaining, under-appreciated little gem which deserves praise.I rate Armageddon 7 out of 10.",Armageddon
239,MadReviewer,Held Back By The Weight Of Its Own Excesses,6,30 April 2001,"The problem with blockbuster films like `Armageddon' is that they want to do everything.  They want heartbreaking romance, pulse-pounding action, gripping drama, slapstick comedy . . . all in the same film.  Trouble is, few films ever succeed in accomplishing this tricky blend of different genres.  `Armageddon' isn't one of them.In a nutshell, `Armageddon' starts out as a disaster epic, with a Texas-sized meteor hurtling towards Earth.  This meteor will obliterate all life on Earth unless a group of oil drillers can somehow fly to the meteor, drill a big hole into the side of the meteor, and blow up the meteor with a sizeable amount of nuclear explosives.  Mixed into this disaster epic is a full-blown romance, comedy, serious, thought-provoking moments, and a smattering of other scenes designed to give `Armageddon' the feel of a true Hollywood epic.  What comes out instead is a true, bloated Hollywood mess. `Armageddon', which at least looks cool and has the superficial sheen of a Hollywood blockbuster, is weighted down by a barely there script and awkward shifts of tone.  It's hard to take a character's impassioned speech about saving the Earth seriously when he's only been cracking jokes about the matter only moments before.  Shifts in mood like this look effortless and natural when they're done right; the shifts between comedy/drama/romance/et cetera in `Armageddon' are labored and forced.  The story suffers from major plot holes as well. Forget the logistical impossibilities of `Armageddon'; even simple stuff gets made unbelievably preposterous.   For example, the meteor is the size of Texas . . . but the drillers only have to drill down four hundred feet into the meteor's surface?  Hey, why bother drilling at all, if that's the case? There's a tedious section of the film involving the Mir space station that does nothing but waste film, there's enough crashes and accidents to fill twelve action films, let alone one - `Armageddon' reeks of excess, and suffers because of it.As Harry Stamper, Bruce Willis saves this film from being unwatchable crap. Even if the story's ludicrous, he makes Harry Stamper a quiet, reluctant, slightly believable hero, and more importantly, he makes Stamper somebody an audience can root for.  Willis is good enough to single-handedly pull `Armageddon' out of the trash and make it at least entertaining.  Also good is Michael Duncan Clarke as `Bear' - he comes across as a person, rather than just as a cartoon character, and as such he's someone to root for as well.  Ben Affleck is completely bland and forgettable as A.J. Frost, as is Liv Tyler as Harry Stamper's daughter Grace- considering they're the two romantically linked characters, it makes for a fairly uninteresting romance. If the Harry Stamper character didn't care so much about Grace and A.J., both of those characters would've been a complete waste of screen time.Still, `Armageddon' deserves credit for trying to hit a home run, even if it only wound up with a cheap single.  The movie's still kind of fun, in a mindless, dumb sort of way.  If you're in the mood for a decent, cheesy popcorn flick, rent it, and watch it on a big screen TV with a killer sound system.  But only watch it once, unless you want the plot holes to drive you utterly mad.  Grade: B-/C+",Armageddon
240,emdoub,A lot to overcome,9,9 December 2005,"Okay - this movie has its flaws. The absurd plot holes, the total disregard for physics, the annoying camera-work during action sequences - all indicate to me that this movie will be somewhere between awful and barely watchable.However, the dialog, characterizations, plot line, subplots, acting, direction, and editing are good enough to overcome those problems. The characters engage you, the situation grips you, and the storytelling is so finely done that the flaws fade like early-morning mist over a lake.This movie has so many flaws that I can't explain how this could happen, but the good points overcome those flaws so well that this movie is in my ""top ten of all time"" for sheer viewing enjoyment. As hackneyed as they are, I cry at the sad parts, and cheer at the high points.As other reviewers have noted, this is a movie without deep thought or message. Many of the ""important"" aspects of movie making have been ignored, or missed badly. But, when the show starts, the audience is glued to their seats - because, without all of those fine, thought-provoking elements that others miss, this movie still entertains. And that seems to be what they wanted to do - not sell a message, not dazzle with deep thought - but simply entertain. And that, it does in a fashion that is unsurpassed.Fine casting, great acting, one helluva story to tell - who cares if it's absurd? It's still one helluva story, and told darn well.",Armageddon
241,mfnmbvp,Armageddon (1998),8,6 March 2012,"Extremely underrated disaster flick, from the same year that Roland Emmerich's 'Godzilla' appeared, 'Armageddon' hits home on a more emotional level than most typical action adventures. The pacing is decent, the characters are all pretty well-developed, even though there is the occasional piece of dialog that was thrown in there to explain some things to the audience. I was thinking about apocalypse/end of the world movies, and I really can't think of too many great ones other than 'Night Of The Living Dead' which sits in an entirely different genre than 'Armageddon', and 'The Road' from 2009 which is also on a completely different scale. In the realm of action-adventure disaster films, 'Armageddon' sits near the top of the list. Maybe it's just me, but they really don't make 'em like this anymore. The characters are all just a little bit too developed, the story is a little bit too human. It tugs at your conscience, unites every person together in a sense that they are all in the struggle to fight against one common enemy, the asteroid. In a way, I am reminded of the awful TV movie 'Asteroid' starring Michael Biehn but that is again, in a pretty different realm. 'Armageddon' is serious work, our cast all play their roles nicely, Billy Bob Thornton of course got more star billing on this piece than he probably deserved, Eddie Griffin's minor role in the beginning is kind of annoying, Jason Isaacs is most convincing as one of NASA's lead scientists, Owen Wilson's role in here is something I had forgotten about also being that he pretty much quit the action scene and moved on to comedy in the years that followed. Professional Russian Peter Stormare is probably one of the film's most likable characters, but most impressive is really Bruce Willis, and that's the way it should be. He gets the audience on a more emotional level than he ever has probably, and still manages to keep that mean uncle sneer on his face the entire time, and doesn't mess around like he's making another 'The Fifth Element'.All factual inaccuracies aside, like the notion of having fire in space, which we are treated to within the first two to three minutes of the film being the most obvious, 'Armageddon' stands strong as a criminally underrated disaster flick. Definitely well-worth your time compared to the trashy flicks that tried following in it's footsteps like '2012' or 'The Day After Tomorrow'.'Armageddon' -----8/10. (Now I can't even capitalize 'Armageddon'? Wtf, Internet Movie Database?)",Armageddon
242,jason_13,One of Bay's worst which is equal to BAD!,4,21 March 2006,"I have to say that I had low expectations for the movie before viewing it. All the people around said it was great, but I perfectly knew what they like. They like Aerosmith's song which is indeed great, they like the amazing special effects which had coasted a lot, they like the comedy side of the movie and of course many girls who love Affleck who according to my opinion is a really bad actor who tried not to be one, failed and now he is nothing. And all these things plus the reviews and the ratings I read in internet, gave me a clue the movie would be a huge disappointment since I am a big disaster kind of movies fan. Well, I've been right, but at least I was prepared.The movie is really commercial. It's been said, but I will say it as again. We have over #100 million budget, we have a romance between Hollywood stars Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler and many other famous actors, who are popular with the fact that they rarely agree on becoming a part of the cast of a commercial movie if their names aren't written with big letters on the screen. Such as Billy Bob Thornton and Steve Buscemi which are highly respected actors that I also like a lot. They could play many characters in many different kind of movies. They could improvise, they could turn tasteless lines into hilarious jokes. On the whole, they could turn small movies into really interesting, funny or dramatic motion pictures, people love and will always love. Such as Fargo in Buscemi's case or A Simple Plan - Thornton. And to be honest, I am really disappointed they took part of Armageddon. Thornton plays a smart and refined man involved in politics if I remember correctly. Buscemi is one of the members of the deep core drilling team which is sent to save the world by destroying the asteroid which is about to vanish the world.What I didn't like - well, I guess I've been already understood. I pointed out bad factors. The story is dull, artless and silly. It is so obvious that the movie depends on the effects and the dramatic ending that it's ridiculous. At least movies like Deep Impact and Godzilla have something special that might be considered as art. At least it ain't that obvious that the movie is made of financial purposes. Other than that, bad performances from all the huge stars. The jokes ain't funny, the lines are absurd and sometimes, they doesn't make sense at all. In fact, I recently read that on the stage, Ben Affleck has asked Bay whether it would be easier if they teach astronauts to drill, than drillers to becomes astronauts and Bay's reply has been simply ""Shut up!"" which is a really funny story which perfectly shows the creators's desperation.And enclosing, I'll give an explanation why I give 4 to the movie. Well, I like ""Don't Want to Miss a thing"" and I was impressed by the special effects which are obviously the only good thing in the movie. The first scene is memorable. These are the the only 2 good things I liked about the movie. Michael Bay is an average director, but The Rock and both Bad Boys were hundreds of times better than Armageddon which was, is and will always be one big bad movie.",Armageddon
243,jmmustchin,A fun adventure,8,19 December 2018,"In 65 million BC, an asteroid is hurtling towards earth, making a devastating impact. Charlton Heston narrates: ""This is the earth at the time the dinosaurs roamed a lush and fertile planet. A piece of rock just six miles wide changed all that. It struck with the force of 10,000 nuclear weapons. A million tons of dirt and rock hurtles into the atmosphere, creating a suffocating blanket of ash and dust the sun was powerless to penetrate for 1000 years. It happened before. It will happen again. It's only a matter of when.""In the present, the shuttle Atlantis is destroyed in space by a meteor shower. Not knowing what's heading their way, the US upgrades to DEFCON 3. The meteors bombard the north Atlantic, with massive destruction shown in New York. At the same time, an amateur astronomer spots a mysterious anomaly in space.NASA Director Dan Truman, on speaking with the amateur, moves the Hubble Telescope, and spots a Texas-sized asteroid on a direct collision course with earth. It'll hit in 18 days. ""It doesn't matter where it hits. Nothing will survive - not even bacteria.""Thus begins 1998's most successful film, ARMAGEDDON. As you can guess from it's opening, it's a highly fun action-disaster film. True, it's science fiction, and it's not scientifically accurate - but who cares? It's highly fun to watch. There are some awkward scenes in the first half of the film - but the second half more than makes up for it. The action is awesome, the premise is scary (especially when one considers that in real life, WE COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT), and the special effects are AWESOME!An awesome movie.",Armageddon
244,LagerLagerLagerShouting,Edam.,3,29 April 2008,"This film, another typically generic effort from Captain America Michael Bay, is so cringe-inducingly bad you will forget it is meant to be an edge-of-seat thriller. The acting and the dialogue are so cheesy and it is full of so many plot holes that its a surprise that the meteor wasn't shaped like a giant piece of Edam. Similarly the characters are all totally unbelievable and pointlessly annoying, especially Liv Tyler's (would they really let an emotionally unstable civilian in the NASA control room when the world is at stake!).Although the plot is kept to a minimum in favour of action, it is so ridiculously implausible it is laughable. Throw in the whole America saves the world, again, motto, Bay's slow-mo emo montages and his uncanny ability to capture the American flag in shot whenever he can, it seems almost like a NASA propaganda video and a very bad one at that. The only thing believable in this joke of a film is that a group of pompous, testosterone-driven American bloke civilians can spend more time fighting with each other and dicking about on a meteor heading for Earth instead of actually getting on with the job even if the fate of humanity depended on it.3/10",Armageddon
245,Nobody-27,hollywood at it's worst,1,21 July 2000,"Even with a simple and unbelievable story like some big asteroid coming from nowhere, and of all the infinitely big empty space going exactly for the planet earth, this could've been at least an OK film. But, all the other things that make a good film are missing here from the start. The childish and unbelievable scene of the father shooting at his daughter's boyfriend; the lack of true emotions by any one character; the script which calls for meteor showers any time the film gets boring; the total predictability of the plot; the shallowness of characters and bad acting on their part (which I think has more to do with direction then actors). In any case, a week story gets an even weaker script which gets made into a boring special effects fest. Steve Buscemi was good as always. Other then that I have a hard time remembering anything else that was good about this film...",Armageddon

As for problems to the plot lines: Glass cockpit windshields, that is what caused the complete destruction of Independence, they should have welded metal over the windshields and put in surveillance (observation) cameras. Chasing asteroids or comets is not a smart idea ever, has anyone ever heard of tail debris. As for when they landed at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral being that they had just been walking around on an asteroid they most likely would have been quarantined not have been running around shaking hands and slapping backs in congratulation of a job well done. The inaccuracies are too many to recall, but then again little compared to those written by screen writers and the technical and scientific advisers for Sy-Fy channel movies, what do you expect from NBC/Universal.",Armageddon
247,Altaira,Utterly Mindblowingly Awful,1,6 July 1999,"Counting the two Problem Child disasters, this is the third worst movie I've ever suffered through.  At times I wondered if ""Armadgeddon"" was a really a movie at all: at its heart it's simply a bunch of predictable explosions strung together by a plot thin enough to break through with a feather.  It's Hollywood at its pathetic worst. Let me back up my stern dislike for this wreck.  First, so many laws of basic science dealing with gravity, heat, and other apparently non-important ideas are broken, I will not attempt to list all the anomalies.  Second, things are constantly being blown up.  Now, that's to be expected in the typical Action/Summer Blockbuster, but it happens so many times in Armageddon we are tired by the first quarter of the film.  Things explode for the sake of exploding.  I'm curious how many of these disasters happen in the movie, but I don't have the patience to sit throught it again and count. Another fatal flaw: Everything must go wrong.  Sure, a plot requires conflict, but so many things get...well, messed up, it's actually funny. Seriously, I sat through this ""thrillride"" and predicted the next scene. I was right, oh, 19 times out of 20.  My one mistake was when I didn't bother to guess.  It is sadly, sadly predictable. Then of course, we have that obligatory dramatic scene near the end when Our Hero (I will not reveal his identity if someone out there, heaven forbid, actually wants to see this monstrocity) takes a few moments to tell the world goodbye.  Hello--he's supposed to be saving them!!!  At this point, every second counts as that giant rock of mass destruction hurtles toward Earth! So there is the demise of Armageddon.  There's much more that really damns the whole movie, but I can't go into more detail or this review will span several pages.  My advice:  Don't waste your time!!! If you want a big end-of-the-world-is-swiftly-approaching-film, rent Deep Impact.  That isn't a good movie but slightly better than Armageddon.  May this movie be shoved into the darkest bowels of Hollywood demise.",Armageddon
248,Old Crow-2,A really really really stupid movie,1,31 August 1999,"Simply said, Armageddon sucks!!!!!! It´s awful!!!!!! I could have fallen asleep in the theatre if it wasn´t that loud. Mindless action (yes, those effects are awesome), irritating characters (especially Bruce Willis)... Deep Impact was MUCH better...I give it 1 out of 10.",Armageddon
249,amichnea,Rewatched this film last Saturday,10,13 July 2009,"Well I read the review done by Marcus Eden-Ellis from United Kingdom last week and though it to be quite silly, but since I did not see the film recently I couldn't comment. On Saturday as I was flicking through the channels and my missus was sleeping next to me I saw Armageddon on TV, so I started watching it until 1 AM... and today I am going to comment on some of the points that were criticised.First of all: THIS IS A FICTIONARY FILM!!!! You watch it as fiction, it is pure entertainment. But if you want to be scientifically accurate... there is no proof to say this film is inaccurate... hence the fact that no one on Earth flew a ship onto an asteroid to blow it up... I hardly call that stupid. Remember the world used to be flat until not so long ago, and people got burned at a stake if they said they could fly.I honestly watched this and 11 years on and I still think it is brilliant just as when I saw it in the cinema. It makes you connect with the characters, you actually feel sad and I bet some people cried at the end. It has plenty of action... and will keep you entertained.My Defence for the film: Why didn't NASA send its own astronauts?? well let's see, the job was to drill on a new terrain never drilled on before. The drill team have been at it for over 30 years... so professionals... that was their jobs. Just like the pilots for the ships, I could ask why didn't they teach the drillers how to fly the ship and send them without pilots? Oh and if NASA did decide to send its pilots instead of the drillers the film would become Deep Impact:) how about that eh? I have to agree that they didn't need the Gatling guns... specially since they were trying to save space and weight.""12-inch diameter drills that make 36-inch diameter holes"", well lets see the drill head was a lot wider than the pipe... guess that details was missed out by the viewer.Sun glasses in a space helmet? who cares... I can drop down shades in my motorbike helmet with the click of a button... why wouldn't that be possible in a space suit? Animal crackers scene... what was wrong with that? Couple being silly... romantic...'personnel trackers' on astronauts? wow that would be very very hard right? since these days you have personal GPS systems to track your kids, dog, wife:)... etc ""Ben Affleck succeeds in singlehandedly causing the whole joint to explode in spectacular Hollywood fashion."" and I though the space station blew up because of sparks and faulty fuel lines... but maybe I need to watch it again for the 10th time just to make sure.""800 feet into something the size of TX is less than a pinprick"" glad people paid attention to the fact that the asteroid was a lot wider than shallow, so yeah flat way size of Texas, deep... no idea they didn't say but 800 feet was enough to cause the fissures and blow it up.A gun smuggled onboard? Well since it was a military/NASA/government with civilians I would say that would be acceptable.I think I covered most of the bad points, but wait the best one: ""Space Dementia"": Space dementia is the term NASA uses to describe the hypothetical mental condition a few astronauts experience when they're in space. This can be contributed towards feelings of insignificance, insecurity lack of social contact and the astronauts awareness of total isolation from the human race. The truth is actually stranger than fiction. In NASA's guidelines for space station emergencies and crisis's there is also guidelines on how to handle mental breakdowns What should be done when a fellow astronaut goes bonkers? Astronauts are instructed to bind the stricken flier's wrists and ankles with duct tape, restrain the torso with bungee cords and administer strong tranquilizers.All in all I think I said enough, 11 years on and this film is a classic, has brilliant actors, good action, love story, humour and it allows you to connect with some of the characters.",Armageddon
250,rbsjrx,"2-Dimensional characters, laughably bad technically",2,24 June 2002,"I *really* hate this movie (however, I loved Deep Impact.) It's hard to know where to begin...1.  OK, we're all used to sci-fi movies having noise in the vacuum of space, but having two space shuttles dock with the space station from opposite directions while doing aerodynamic banking?!? C'mon!!! The poor suckers from NASA who let these clowns borrow their training facility are probably still cringing (or laughing) over that one!2.  Could Liv Tyler be a worse actress? At least she took a few more lessons before doing LOTR! At the end, when she walks off, smiling hand-in-hand with her boyfriend after her father's death, I only wanted to slap her.3.  Lest anyone think I'm picking on Liv Tyler, I would hasten to add that *all* the characters were cardboard sterotypes and a lot of the blame has to fall to the director and writers as well as the actors.You expect something like ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"" to be bad, but spending this much money on something this bad with such available talent should be a crime!",Armageddon

Armageddon is nothing but a giant action scene, they are running back and forth so much, with actual lines that are so rare that you can't barely understand what is happening in any scene of the whole movie. The only lines seem like they are devoted to the drillers that are (supposedly) saving our planet. I always thought dramatic dust and oil coming from the drillers was what was helping to destroying the planet to begin with.I can't help laughing so much at the drama through Armageddon, it is nothing but an action scene devoted to get people loving the oil industry and the Space Shuttle. If anything, they wouldn't have used the shuttle, and the military would probably be doing most of this, simply in an attempt to knock it off-course, as last resort would they be blowing up the asteroid.

It had just the right amount of humor and is jam packed with action. Watch it again if you thought it was bad. Maybe you fell alseep. I know I will watch it countless times on DVD.

This film is one of the most trite, cliche-ridden exercises ever with not a single original moment in it.  I believe Liv Tyler has a smile on her face through the whole thing because she knows it's so bad.  Unfortunately, browsers can't rate films a ""0"" at IMDb.

Therefore the nuke will explode and Earth will be safe once again. But, the team runs into a few snags for example Harry (Bruce) doesn't really like A.J.

Peter Stormare is excellent as the space happy Russian cosmonaut.  Bruce Willis is as always, wry and dry.  He has a splendid talent for comedy that isn't always appreciated.  I'm not very knowledgeable on special effects, but the asteroid itself becomes a sinister presence in the movie.  While I realize that no asteroid ever seen looked like that vision of hell, I don't care.So, if you want to see a fun scifi, watch Armageddon.  Forget the carping. Enjoy.",Armageddon
262,tallguy62,"stupid, lame, trite and, above all, SAPPY as hell",1,15 October 2007,"The worst movie I have seen in many a year. Who produces this garbage and calls it good film-making? For one thing, it was not suspenseful in the slightest. It is almost as bad as the made-for-TV disaster movie 10.5. I would say it is only slightly better than Deep Impact, which was another horrible movie that came out at the same time. The script is lousy and the characters so unbelievable you almost want to laugh. No wonder the ""disaster"" movie genre died a quiet death after the 1970s. Why is Hollywood trying to bring it back? At least in some of the ""disaster"" flicks of the 1970s, like Earthquake or The Towering Inferno, we had a sense of foreboding. This movie does not even rise to that level.The part of the movie that I groaned at was when the ""astroidonauts"" or whatever you call them were saying to their girlfriends ""Honey, I love you...goodbye"" on the telephone-TV. After sitting in the theater for about 2 hours wanting this awful movie to end, I wanted to throw up, it was so sappy and phony. Does Hollywood think viewers want to see this kind of Karo syrup in an action movie? It was not even believable. By the way, Ben Affleck cannot act his way out of a paper bag and this movie proves that. The only reason Bruce Willis is in the film is because he is a box-office ""draw."" If I were Willis, I'd be embarrassed to have been associated with this BOMB. Bad, bad, bad. Avoid at all costs.",Armageddon

264,jmhammerstein-980-842586,wonderful movie,10,24 September 2016,"Armageddon is a Deep Impact-like movie where an asteroid is discovered to be on a collision course with Earth after a meteor shower destroys a space shuttle and hits New York City. The asteroid is big enough that if it hits Earth, it will kill all life. Oil rig drillers are asked to fly to the asteroid and drill a hole in it and plant a bomb to blow it up. They blow it into two pieces which don't hit the Earth. This is a great movie in that the special effects are very good and it's very fun and intense. It opens with a depiction of an impact that is thought to have killed the dinosaurs and a narrator commenting on that. One of the top few best scenes and maybe the best scene is where Paris is hit by a meteorite and is destroyed in a huge explosion.",Armageddon
265,Tron79,"One for Bruce, one for Liv, and one for the song",3,25 November 2018,"I just re-watched this over Thanksgiving weekend and I was blown away by the absurdity of it all. The premise itself is possible enough. A giant meteor could be on its way to crash into us, since it happened to the dinosaurs. I can also go with the idea that we want the best drillers to handle the drilling. Actually, sending the rag-tag group of skilled non-astronauts was the most plausible part, so I didn't have a problem with that idea. Perhaps a nuclear warhead could split a meteor. It's hard to say. Then I started thinking about the absurd things. There were so many absurd things in this movie, I have to list a few. 1) Having two new shuttles ready for launch 2) Launching and training in less than 20 days 2) Having some absolutely amazing monster trucks with multiple drills ready to go in 20 days. 3) Having nuclear weapons ready to go. 4) Actually thinking it would work to land on a rocky asteroid with a shuttle at all!!!!!!!!!! I guess they thought putting jet skis on instead of wheels would do the trick. 5) Landing a shuttle in zero atmosphere. The shuttle just falls like a rock and is barely a glider, but it does need air to keep level. 6) Since the space station blew up during fueling, how did the shuttle get fuel to finish the mission? I could go on and on and on. All of these thing being said, they still made this movie. I give one star for Bruce Willis. He does have star quality and he's enjoyable to watch. I'll give one star for Liv Tyler. Her role in this movie was to look amazing. She played that part well. I'll give one more star for the song. Liv's dad sung one of my favorite tracks.It was surreal to see the twin towers in New York still standing, and then to see a meteor shower damage them. When buildings started coming down in New York, I couldn't help think about 911 and my mood changed from watching entertainment to remembering reality. That part was very real to me, but the rest of the movie was just totally BS. I do hope we have a better plan for such things if we do find a meteor out there one day.",Armageddon
266,Speechless,Like watching the tip of a spinning propeller blade,4,18 November 2000,"Armageddon is just one dilemma after another, and you can sense the desperation with which each new obstacle/problem was added to the film.  I still don't understand what causes the Russian space station to explode, other than the movie's general need to have something blow up every few minutes regardless of cause or effect.  Later in the film there is a retread of the always dependable which-wire-do-I-pull-to-defuse-this-bomb routine, which works in many movies but just doesn't make sense here.  It's not a terrorist bomb--the astronauts work for the organization that made it, NASA, who in any acceptable circumstance would have thoroughly briefed everyone about the bomb and told them exactly what wire to pull should such an emergency arise (or, even better, put a STOP DETONATION SEQUENCE button somewhere on it).  And then Steve Buscemi just starts randomly shooting stuff because apparently he didn't think they were in enough trouble yet. That's how this movie works--bad things happen for these astronauts, and it doesn't matter how or why they happen as long as they happen.  The film would have been much, much better if it had just taken a couple of these dilemmas and developed them more, but the story ended up being a constant barrage of obstacles and setbacks that just end up canceling each other out. You know these guys are always going to be in trouble but then just barely scrape through, and what should be exciting becomes an onslaught of boredom.
But it's the editing that really derails this movie.  It's impossible to tell what's going on in the action sequences because they're edited so quickly.  You see something for less than a second and, while you're still trying to figure out what you just saw, you see something else, and then something else, and after a while you just give up and let the movie take off without you.  There's no reason for it.  Braveheart and Gladiator used hyper-editing to convey the chaos and randomness of battle; this film uses it to dull us into believing we're watching something exciting or stylish or interesting, even though we're not.  Or maybe it's so we can't see how fake the special effects are, I'm not sure.  Armageddon is a brainless event movie that actually forces a high degree of effort on the part of the viewer, and that's something that should never exist.  You go to a movie like this to relieve stress, not increase it.Have fun with this movie if you can.",Armageddon

268,Lumpenprole,a multimillion dollar blah movie,3,18 March 2002,"spoilersThis movie is not action packed; it's slow and boring.  It's not funny or exciting, it's predictable and plays on cheap sentimentality and vague patriotism.  The special effects are not imaginative or impressive.  They are noisy and uninspired.The acting talent is wasted on hopelessly stupid one-liners and clichés. These are spouted by characters they ought to just be called `gentle giant black man,' `eccentric genius who is about to crack,' `square jawed hero coming of age,' `by-the-book coward,' `luckless gambler who lives by a code of honor,' `impulsive princess' and so on.And the writing!  How many undramatic countdowns did they think they could fit in this thing?  Does a scene where people have to defuse a bomb by cutting one or another wire even count as fiction anymore? The drama of the last 15 minutes of the movie depends on the audience caring if some jerk can put aside his personal differences with Ben Affleck and say bye bye to Liv Tyler in time TO SAVE THE EARTH.  All the work is done; we just have to wait a couple more seconds for Harry Stamper, the jerk, to toss off a few cotton candy lines.  I know Bruce Willis is a generally charismatic guy, but his Harry Stamper character is an obnoxious bore.  I thought he earned the Golden Razzy he was awarded for this role.Since the movie is so long, the plot so obvious, and the dialogue so disposable, one can't help but notice the lame inaccuracies, inconsistencies and plot holes.  800 feet into something the size of TX is less than a pinprick.  Try walking 800 feet into TX and see how close to the center you are.  After all the discussion about the artificial gravity on the Russian station, it appears to be arbitrary once inside.  Actually, gravity comes and goes throughout the movie.  Does it make any sense that anyone besides Michael Bay would give these morons a couple shuttles and send them to blow up an asteroid threatening the earth?The sentimental phone/insurance/cola commercial style montages were revolting.I do like action movies.  Really.  This one is boring, stupid and really stuck on itself.

270,CutUncut2021,Relentless idiocy,10,24 March 2021,"As the first bits of meteoric debris begin to fall on New York, the WTC is still standing, one of the ""bogies"" presciently hits the north tower, a bit lower that the plane did on 9/11, and a later shot shows the peak of the south tower on fire. The ensuing mayhem throughout New York is exquisitely Michael Bay, and what would the multiplex empire be without him? Thanks to screenwriters Hensleigh and Abrams, the entire movie is a witty roller-coaster of shallow nonsense, but who cares. Notably, Bay's heritage is Jewish-Russian (a reminder that ""American"" actually means ""immigrant""), and so the ironies come thick and fast: Hollywood pays his bills but in 1998 Bay was already powerful enough to risk piss-taking, including the touted American values of endurance, valour, national security, amid a stream of acronyms (DC, CIA, FBI, NASA) that lend gravitas to the enterprise. The classic countdowns and tension build-up are handled with a nod to Tim Burton's sacrilegious Mars Attacks in its rampant silliness. Not to mention the round-up of the motley crew to solve the greatest danger to the planet since the event of dinosaur extinction. For the first hour the script is relentlessly hilarious, but whenever the narrative gets semi-serious, it loses some of its mojo. This is also Bay's homage to Americana, larding on every imaginable trope of the US's idea of itself, not least the buddy-buddy macho teamwork. Yes it is crass and formulaic, parading the threadbare ersatz US belief in its wafer-thin democracy, even cliché about the Orient and Europe, yet the result is absurdly heart-warming, despite the distillation of America-first saviour mission not just of the world but of the universe itself. Throw in the docking with a ""clunky"" Russian space-station, and the parody becomes so blatant that it probably eluded most of the multiplex audience, who instead likely saw it as a eulogy to superior American scientific know-how and came out of the theatre feeling smug and rewarded. Midway through the film Bay deftly compensates for the quieter moments with even more wild pyrotechnics. Sure, it drags here and there, but everything points toward the fabled heroics of self-sacrifice, which is widely held to be in the American DNA, even by naturalised migrants. Throw in a festering love equation with an utterly static female (Liv Tyler) and we have the perfect Hollywood formula. Scenes of India, Turkey, Africa, China, a standing ovation for the USA's success of the mission. Watch it again when you're feeling the brunt of human folly in your government's mismanagement of lockdowns and vaccines, evictions and terminated furlough, cronyism and rerouting of public funds.

271,vbz,Celluloid Diarrhoea,3,21 January 2000,"I didn't bother spending a penny on it, but my brother happened to see it for a buck on his college campus. So here's what he thought:Armageddon is by far the worst piece of cinematic trash since Kevin Kostner's, ""The Postman."" Due to the enormous amount of technical inconsistencies found in this film, the subject will have to be addressed in my upcoming treatise entitled, ""How Armageddon Has Violated Science."" Sections will include, Astronomy, Mechanics, Statistics, Thermodynamics, etc... The overall experience of watching this movie can be likened to a trip to the bathroom that has suddenly gone awry. At first the s**t flows smoothly: the menace of the approaching asteroid, and the group of characters that will be pitted against it are given their crude and brief introductions. Regular action movie shit. Nothing to sweat about. Then there is an explosion of diarrhoea which refuses to cease the flow of its mucky blobs for an excruciating two and a half hours. It comes in the form of downright moronic characters whose main repertoire of macho yelling and grunting is framed by MTV style editing which alternately flashes images of gray, crumbling asteroid turf (reminiscent of nothing other than feces), and dimwitted faces of the men. Some action sequences filmed this way actually make even less sense than an average music video. In some places it becomes next to impossible to figure out exactly what's going on, even though the movie's outcome is just as predictable as that of Apollo 13's. Could the world really end? Could these idiots actually save the planet? It's obvious that they will, but by they end you wish that they would all perish. Making violent, gutter trash men the heroes of the picture, the movie also does a terrible injustice to women, making them look like whining, insignificant, subordinate nervous wrecks. ""Armageddon's"" poor quality and its blatant and distasteful use of US patriotism to please audiences places it behind its horrid rival, ""Godzilla.""

281,minnow-6,Save your money and time for something better,5,27 July 2000,"`Armageddon'.  **.  (1998, USA, 144, PG-13. Directed by Michael Bay starring Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck). After about 45 minutes of `Armageddon' I was really enjoying this movie.  The earth was about to be smashed to smithereens by a meteor the size of Texas.  To illustrate that this collision is going to be really bad, the director and special effects crew started the movie with a fantastic meteor shower that almost takes out New York City.  Following the shower, NASA rolls out its secret nuclear stockpile.  A stockpile that's been designed to blow up earth killing rocks from outer space.  The only problem is the President's Chief Science Advisor got a C- in Astrophysics.  Dropping a nuke on the meteor won't help.  First you have to drill an 800-foot hole in the meteor, drop the bomb in the hole and then blow up the meteor from the inside out.  NASA forgot to train the astronauts in the art of drilling.Not to worry, Harry S. Stamper (Willis) is the best driller in the world. He and his crew of misfits can be trained as astronauts in 12 days, fly up to the asteroid, drill the hole, set off the bomb and save the earth.  So far so good, I'm not kidding I liked `Armageddon' up to this point.  I knew some of the guys had to die on this mission.  One of the crew is black (Michael Duncan).  Will Hollywood once again kill the brother or have they been listening to Roger Ebert?  (Ebert exposed this dirty little Hollywood trick of always killing the black guy in several of his reviews.)  Anyway, the training is complete, the personal situations are set up for a three-hanky ending and Freedom and Independence are ready to blast into space.  Unfortunately, the story breaks down into one explosion after another (gas leak during refueling, BOOM; meteor shower on landing; CRASH; broken drill rig, gas leak, meteor quakes, etc., etc., etc.).  The ending is all too predictable.  But in the end, oops I don't want to spoil it for you. But do yourself a favor and find a friend that's seen the movie and ask them to tell you how it ends.

284,petshop,This doesn't work on so many levels for so many reasons,1,2 March 1999,"The most amazing similarity between this film and its sister blockbuster ""Deep Impact,"" is the same level of suckiness they register. This one, the hard-core action flick (as opposed to the spring's sentimental ""human"" one) dredges up just as many horrible lines and schmaltzy relationship scenes. Only it rushes them and leaves character development on the fly, which is fine in a film like this. But it had better make up for it in action. There's a lot of intense music, testosterone-fueled scream-offs, quick cuts, and a few explosions: all the earmarks of action. But no action. Not on the scale of worldwide destruction anyway.Like Deep Impact, much of the best destruction was shown in the trailer. A couple of scenes were saved for those willing to put out the price of admission (like the destruction of Paris), but these are few and far between. Here's the perfect opportunity to randomly cut to any point in the world and show its obliteration by any size meteor the creators deem necessary. What a fantastic image. That's what we're here for. It's only used a couple times.Our hunger for worldwide annihilation is expected to be satiated with excruciatingly long ""action"" scenes like a shuttle refueling gone awry. These scenes simply feel like budget buffers and unnecessarily stretch the film to an uncalled for 2 and a half hours.Any astronomers or physicists, hell anyone who passed 6th grade science, should be prepared to feel insulted by the ignorance the script expects you to have. Even if you know absolutely nothing about things like say, gravity, the holes in simple logic are distracting enough to keep you frustrated: Easy access machine guns mounted on the space shuttle's drill machines? (Even though a handgun is under top secret lock and key) There was tons of debris hindering their landing on the meteor; when they take off, because the run time is way too long, it's miraculously gone. At one moment everyone is rushing because there's only 7 minutes of radio contact left. Hours later, once the action sequence has passed, radio contact is fine. With that big of a budget, you'd think they could stick a PA or two on continuity.Speaking of radio contact, why is it that people in space suits can only hear the other people in space suits with whom they're specifically talking only when they're talking to them? Another annoying transmission snafu: there are only a few moments to drop dead time and Bruce Willis (in outer space) has an unimaginative two minute conversation with his daughter (an earthbound Liv Tyler). I guess the 30 second or so delay between transmission and receipt of each line was inconvenient to the story line. And hey, why was there a camera in his suit, but nobody else's?Of course the special effects are decent. They better be for that much money. Few of the applications are creative, these generally involved crashing meteors. The effects used on the surface of the big kahuna meteor are unconvincing and bland. Digital effects look so obvious now, they seem to have reached their limit in simply awing us by existing, now they need creativity and unusual application.Bay does try to infuse some style into the shoot. A few cool angles here and there, and generally nice shot composition. Unfortunately he goes AT&T/British Airways commercial in his montages of all the wholesome cultures around the world uniting in fear and prayer on the eve of Armageddon. At some points the dialogue and character plots are so bad, so pre-fab, one can't help but hope for a sign that this is all tongue-in-cheek. Please, just a pinch of irony. Is this how stupid we've become? Is ID4 really the masterpiece, formula-setting film this movie sets it up to be?The film starts out with some promise. The impromptu meteor shower on New York with a sprinkling of zany characters gives us the hope for a sarcastic, playful Armageddon. But the waterworks and lovey-dovey crap are heaped on soon thereafter. Armageddon may bring on the end of worldwide destruction movies.",Armageddon
285,Jonas1969,Not Bruce Wills worst effort ever (but a close second),1,23 June 2009,"Yes this will turn into a bit of a rant because I can't stand this stinker. But Bruce has actually lent his name to even worse dung in the past with 'Hudson Hawk', but there at least it's possible to laugh at the sheer horror of it all, but Armageddon is so offensive in it's stereotypes that I can't stand to watch.It's been said in other reviews that this is a movie for Independence Day fans and I agree as long as they are prepared for even worse stereotypes and no characters that are lovable. ID has Will Smith & Jeff Goldblum in nice quirky roles with some humanity, but Armageddon has no character depth at all and the 'humour' never gets above the potty level.If either Billy Bob Thornton, Steve Buscemi or Peter Stormare are proud of this then I would be astonished. I even expect better from Michael Bay: the director of such junk as Pearl Harbour & Bad Boys. Why? Well he has done the flawed but OK 'The Island' & the stereotypical but entertaining 'The Rock'.Many modern action flicks are flawed in their portrayals of countries & cultures but stereotypes about Germans & South Africans aside 'Die Hard' & 'Lethal Weapon (2)' still manage to outweigh this with their charm, wit & pace. Armageddon does not.For apocalypse movies see: 'Deep Impact' or even the better than it's rated 'Twister'. If you want action you can pretty much chose anything & it will be better - why not revisit 'The Rock' by Michael Bay. Comedy: Even a Greek tragedy has more humor than this so you can pick anything & it will be better.I've rated about 250 movies on IMDb and my average score is 6.6. This is the only movie I've given a 1 (no I haven't rated 'Hudson Hawk' yet). When I give a score below 3 it has to be a truly bad movie - and this is just about the worst I've seen. If you are like me watch all sci-fi, then by all means live through it, but otherwise avoid it at all cost.",Armageddon
286,heywood100,Worse than you might be expecting...,1,8 May 2003,"To be blunt - Armageddon might just be the worst movie I've ever seen. It's a horribly cynical cash-in, with every facet of the movie designed to maximise its profits amongst movie goers looking for a ""summer blockbuster"". Even more than most films of this kind. There's the utterly shameless flag waving attitude (topped off by the drunk Russian astronaut), there's the endless cliches you can see coming a mile off, there's the obligatory romance, there's the fact that they never stop playing that bleedin' Aerosmith song (*cough*nepotism*cough*), and there's the fact that, shame of all shames, Steve Buscemi's in it but it's still crap. How can you put Steve Buscemi in a film and still make it devoid of all and any value? The answer - make Armageddon, a film which is never, ever going to even approach respectability.Avoid. Avoid as if your life depended on it. Please.",Armageddon
287,MarshallStax,What a gigantic crock! Er...rock...,2,22 February 1999,"In terms of value for budget dollars spent, ""Armageddon"" is the worst movie ever made.  The movie has nothing to say about anything; it is purely an exercise in eye candy.  It is a piece of product without feeling plugged into the machine of feature film distribution.  It is cold and cynical, believing that all the audience wants to see is physics.  Judging from the box office, maybe the powers-that-be that green-lighted this project were right. But what about the movie?  The acting ranges from passable (Willis) to gut-wrenchingly awful (Affleck).  A mannequin named Liv Tyler plays The Beautiful Girl with all the verve and passion of a piece of shrubbery. The story goes that this movie was green-lighted and put into pre-production without even a script; it would be hard to argue after viewing the results.  There are many great screenwriters out there that can't get work, and then here comes this barely-even-written film to add insult to injury.  I had heard that living legend Robert Towne (Academy Award winner for ""Chinatown"") ghost wrote dialogue for a scene or two in this film; imagine how the movie would have been if he had been hired to actually write the SCRIPT instead of just doctoring dialogue.      The movie plays with all the depth of a Levi's or Pepsi ad; it looks like a music video for the movie ""Armageddon"".  Only on a purely visual level does ""Armageddon"" work at all, and even then it is heavy-handed and obvious, with shots screaming out ""look how cool this is!"", subtle as a sledgehammer. Michael Bay, Jerry Bruckheimer and their ilk have perpetrated yet another abomination on the cinema; as if ""The Rock"", ""Con Air"", etc...weren't bad enough, now we have this piece of space debris.  At least product like this keeps the studios going so that worthwhile movies can be still be made.",Armageddon

Well the special effects were okay, but everything else is so offensively bad that the chance of the effects saving this movie is about as plausible as the plot.I'm sorry but Michael Bay is the anti-christ of cinema. I would have rather watched ""Batman and Robin"" twice than sit through 30 minutes of this piece of junk.You know the scene in Clockwork Orange where they re-educate Alex with drugs, music and those ultra-violent visuals. Well this movie works just as well. I still feel ill thinking about it.It's like that annoying drunk guy at a bar who smells and is yelling bad jokes in your face. The one you would give anything for just for him to shut up, but you can't leave cause you want to see his butt thrown out of the bar, which is bound to happen at any point.This is cinema for the lowest common denominator.And of course you have morons defending it by saying it's not trying to be anything but entertainment; lighten up; this isn't a merchant ivory pic; it's just $8 worth of fun, etc.Great I'm all for simple mindless fun. But you still need plausibility and story and acting so you can believe. If you don't care about the characters then what is the use of showing me one of them sacrificing himself for another. If it had any of these things (even slightly), then it would of be fun.This movie is like some child telling you some improvised story with action figures: ""And then the Tonka truck guys go into space...and then they land on the ass-teroid...and then they drive around it and almost float away...and they have to put a bomb in a hole..wait wait I forgot the part about the drills...they have these big drills...and then the guy cries...and then the bomb goes booooooooosh.

An almost thoroughly pathetic enterprise, periodically enlivened with action, but it's utterly difficult to care about anybody involved. All actors are going through the motions. America is symbolized by Norman Rockwell, heartland American-flag-blowing-in-the-blue-sky , and it's all about as touching as a tracheotomy. Actually, maybe this movie could have used a tracheotomy. Furthermore, it squeezes about as much running time as it can before a stirringly anticlimactic climax, where Willis drives his big drill into the asteroid, pumping it full of...never mind. Not even entertaining in a train wreck sort of way.",Armageddon
291,forrestwrs,The Michael Bay School Of Film,1,13 September 2010,"Armageddon was a cheese ball of a mess. Michael Bay must have worked extremely hard to make sure this movie was about as god-awful as he could get it.I'll start out with Mr. Bay. The Michael Bay School of Film has three rules: Rule#1: Have stuff go wrong *constantly!* It raises tension and totally never gets annoying or takes away from the storyline! Rule#2: Explosions are good! Put in lots and lots of explosions! Rule#3: Move the camera constantly! Like, every single darn shot! Never ever pause to look at anything or develop a scene! No, we don't have the time for that stuff! A lot of the disaster in this disaster flick was really confusing. The scene where the space shuttle is destroyed and everyone inside it dies was pretty cool, but I had to rewatch that scene twice to see what the heck was going on and who was even in the shuttle.Now, I won't start bashing the movie for being scientifically inaccurate. I can let a lot of that slide. I'm watching this to be entertained, not taught. Of course, it could at least entertain me. That would be nice. And a lot of the movie had moments where I was going ""Okay, no. That's where I draw the line."" For instance, they knew 18 days ahead of time that this asteroid was coming? If you know *anything* about astronomy, you know that it's extremely difficult to predict when an asteroid is going to hit the earth. You have a better chance of predicting next year's weather forecast. But what really struck me was that the movie was really predictable. I won't give away the ending, but halfway through the first act, you're probably aware how it's going to end anyway.As for the screenplay and storyline itself... holy god what a mess. First of all, through the first half hour of the movie I was going ""Okay, it'd be nice if you would slow down and take some time to develop some of these characters. Or at least let us learn something about them."" And then he did slow down. Way too much. He just decided ""Screw it,"" and didn't take his story *anywhere* for a good half-hour or so.And then he brutally forces a lot of the emotion in the movie. It's like in those retarded spoof movies where the filmmakers are going ""Laugh, darn it!"" except Bay is saying ""Cry, darn it!"" To give it credit, there was the scene with Will Patton and his ex-wife that was actually pretty well done. Of course, the scene barely finishes before we cut away from it (in fact, I'm pretty sure the scene wasn't quite done yet). What does he cut to? A strip club. Thank you for that, movie. I didn't start watching this to see a drama about an asteroid destroying the earth. No, I wanted to see a strip club! Continuing on, the characters were really poorly developed. A good example is Ben Affleck's character. I mean, why am I supposed to care about this guy?? He's obviously incompetent, makes all the wrong choices, and he's kind of a douche bag. He really is just useless. Am I supposed to care about him because he's in love with Liv Tyler? I'm really not sure why she is anyway, except because, as Bruce Willis even says early on in the film, she ""doesn't have any other options."" This brings me to the acting. God did these actors suck. I really expected a lot out of Willis. I look at Die Hard and Pulp Fiction and I think, ""okay, he's going to give a good performance."" But, he really doesn't. I mean, for the first act of the movie he has some non-descript accent. And then he loses it as the story progresses. Then there's Liv Tyler. At least now I know where Kristen Stewart learned how to act for the Twilight movies. Tyler's entire performance was based on moping and never ever changing her facial expression. As for Ben Affleck, he sucks. Plain and simple. He was annoying, I hated his character, and he just sucked.There were a couple of redeeming actors, however. Steve Buscemi actually gave me some entertainment from his on screen persona, and Will Patton seemed to put in some effort and try. I'll give them points for giving decent performances.Another very redeeming quality from the movie was the music. The soundtrack was awesome. I really just wanted to turn off the picture and just listen to the music. But, alas, I could not.As for the special effects--the Oscar nominated special effects, no less--they were really cool. But they were also done in a hurry. We'd see about seven seconds of special effects and then the movie would get ADD and start filming stuff falling down somewhere. The cameraman just didn't seem to be able to stick with the scene no matter how hard he tried. Ever.Frankly, this is one of the worst directed movies I've ever seen. There's hardly anything entertaining about it and the main character seems to be the $4 million explosions rather than Willis, Affleck, or Buscemi. And the characters were extremely hard to keep track of, the action sequences were thrown together haphazardly, and a lot of the logic in the movie was just bulled together. The movie was just bad. Disjointed, campy, incompetent, and bad bad bad.2/10",Armageddon
292,geiri,Underrated Masterpiece,10,3 November 1998,"After a meteorite storm ravages New York City, NASA discovers that an asteroid the size of Texas is speeding toward Earth. With just eighteen days before impact, NASA executive director Dan Truman (BILLY BOB THORNTON) discovers that he has only one viable option -- to drill a hole in the asteroid and then plant and detonate a nuclear bomb hoping that the internal explosion will split the rock into two pieces that will miss Earth. Thus, Truman enlists Harry Stamper (BRUCE WILLIS) and his deep core oil drilling team, known to be the best in the world. Harry's got other problems, however -- most notably trying to keep one of his gung ho workers, A.J. Frost (BEN AFFLECK) ,away from his beautiful adult daughter, Grace (LIV TYLER). Even so, Harry realizes he has to go and save the world and agrees to do what he can. Thus, he and team -- which includes Frost; his best friend, Chick Chapple (WILL PATTON); a squirrelly geologist, Rockhound (STEVE BUSCEMI); big man Max Lennert (KEN CAMPBELL); and an odd assortment of other characters train for their dangerous mission.Blasting off into space aboard two space shuttles, Harry and his team are accompanied by NASA astronauts Colonel Willie Sharp (WILLIAM FICHTNER), co-pilot Jennifer Watts (JESSICA STEEN), and mission specialist Gruber (GRAYSON McCOUCH). There they dock with a Russian space station where cosmonaut Lev Andropov (PETER STORMARE) joins them after a calamitous accident. From that point on, the assembled team races toward the asteroid. Encountering various obstacles and bureaucratic blunders back on Earth, Harry and his team race against time to drill eight hundred feet into the rock, plant the nuke, and blast off before the asteroid plummets into the Earth, completely destroying it in a fiery Armageddon. This is a great film and one of the best that came out this summer with a great mix off action,comedy and drama and much more entertaining than DEEP IMPACT and if you like Michal Bay/Jerry Bruckheimer then you will not be disappointed.

Soundtrack 9/10 Some songs are a little off of course but the ending song from Aerosmith did everything in order to restore what the others didn't, the music is good and the ending song was the perfect choice really, not bad at all, and because of that I liked it a lot more then I should've, so the soundtrack should be bought just for that, I welcome to movie home because of that! Special Effects 9/10 There are a lot of Special Effects in this movie and for what they are they are all really good, it feels like they are completely real, and while some surely are some aren't and those that aren't work just as well, this is an action flick and for what it is they are great, nothing bad to say about the effects really! Overall 8/10 This movie isn't the best movie, but it surely isn't as bad as many would tell you that it is, it starts a little slow and picks up rather fast, and if you liked Ben Affleck's Character then that's just another bonus for you there!",Armageddon

Most pleasing however were the characters themselves (no offense Bruce, but this ain't true of your earlier works).  Bruce Willis is credible, likeable and believable (did I really say that?).  Ben Affleck and Liv Taylor make a great couple -- wouldn't be surprised to see them matched again somewhere -- and the rest of the crew are just plain everyday people trying to do a job.

What is sacrifices in acting, plot, and versimilitude it more than compensates with just one hell of a great action film. It wasn't created to change lives.The bad stuff first, who thought Liv Tyler could act? I mean look at her, she's awful. Ben Affleck is also a terrible actor, but this was the better of his performances. Then there's science and Hollywood science. I was not an astrophysics major but even I could tell that this film was re-writing most of the scientific premises mankind has known for centuries. Little things like the shuttle's approach to the asteroid through a cosmic shower of rocks at 22,000 MPH was just a little hard to believe. Fire and wind on the asteroid, the Evel Knieval Armadillo jump, on and on. It's moments like those who say ""hey wait a second.."" and then you just have to let it go. Oh and let's not forget the ""impenetrable titanium alloy skin"" on these shuttles. Except when it comes to bullets.Otherwise this film was amazing. Very entertaining, very interesting. While many flame Bruce Willis' acting ability I have always thought he brings a sincerity of spirit to each of his roles. His performance was warm and likable. I thought Billy Bob Thornton was the best thing in this film. The supporting cast of ""retards turned astronauts"" added a comedic, yet human, dimension which worked great. The patriotic tenor of the film was unmistakable, yet not obnoxious. By then end of this film even I shed a tear or two. And thats's really all it's about. Escapist pleasure, pure and simple. And hey let's face it, if the film simply reproduced real physics and real space travel then, well, I think we could say we've already seen The Right Stuff.Loads of fun, great post-view conversation material, and unexpected swerves make this film a hit.

Paris and New York get very battered by incoming meteor showers.  Those scenes are very spectacular.  If you're looking for a movie with a lot of special-effects, and you are an action fan, this is the film for you.  This movie is fast-paced, but still lasts 2 1/2 hours.  The only thing I thought was ludicrously silly was after a scene where Bruce Willis was shooting golf balls at Greenpeace.

You'd be hard pressed to put together a bigger piece of cr*p than this Bruce Willis vehicle.Armageddon is the story (and I use that term loosely) of a team of ""Super-Drillers"" flying off to destroy an asteroid before it destroys the Earth.  Realistic?  Not really.  But who cares?  It's an action flick.  I'm not blasting the premise.Minor spoilers:The movie begins with a couple of scenes designed to introduce the threat and the characters.  Bruce Willis is the tough-as-nails leader of the team, and spends his first bit of screen time chasing around Ben Affleck with a gun for the unforgiveable act of sleeping with his daughter.  For some reason, that didn't make me laugh.  It was forced, like everything in this movie.The team is called in because they're the only people in the whole wide world who can drill the asteroid.  Okay, I'm prepared to accept that premise if it gets us to the action - the supposed meat of the movie.  More attempts at humor, with each character going out to do some crazy, nutty thing before blast off.  Again, lame.  Finally, they take off.  Here's where the movie really pi**ed me off.  They arrive on the rock, and set to work.  Would you believe it, nothing works right and everything has a suspenseful countdown!!!  Whoah!  Ten, nine, eight... one - Oh, surprise surprise we saved the day again!!And don't even get me started on the jerky camerawork.  When I saw it in the theater I thought I was going to be sick.  I can only assume they were trying to cover up the gargantuan holes left by the insipid performances by cutting away to a different shot every few seconds (and this from someone raised on MTV - Mr short attention span himself).Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse... wait - there's a manufactured tearjerker ending that was so tacked on it made the rest of the film a virtual Citizen Kane.Summary: The witticisms weren't witty.  The plot - well, I said I'd let that one go.  The acting was bad.  Really bad.  Even Billy Bob couldn't rise above the script, which was worse.  Camerawork - again, bad.  (I didn't even mention the dumbest love scene in the history of motion pictures - think animal crackers).Rating: 1 out of 10.  (I'm giving a half point for Steve Buscemi, who makes me smile against my will and another half point for the times I was able to look at the lovely Liv Tyler and attempt to ignore her acting performance) This is far and away the worst movie I've gone to see in the theater... ever.",Armageddon

305,j30bell,"Alas, the end of the world was not nigh",2,23 December 2004,"While watching this film, I was reminded of the futility of trusting politicians. This moment came when the President of the United States said ""the bible calls this time Armageddon - the end of all things""It's a sad fact, but life is never that kind.When big, bad, balding, butch Bruce looks solemnly into the camera and, with creditable sincerity, delivers the line ""six billion people on the planet, why d'ya call me?"" you know something special is afoot. Lesser men - Lawrence Olivier, maybe, or Alec Guinness - would have cringed at the thought of having to deliver such verbiage without an ironic sneer. Not Bruce. Bruce, like the women of Sunset Strip, is a pro. Either that, or ironic sneers were not required in his contract. Judging by the rest of the film, neither were shame, dignity or self-respect.Were there ever to be an unholy union between Top Gun and Cobra, the cinematic wreckage that would result might resemble Armageddon. It's a testosterone fuelled, guttural paean to trailer park America.In many Hollywood films, for instance, technical jargon is used to pad out a dull script. Armageddon is no exception, except that here the writers clearly couldn't be bothered to find any real jargon and just made stuff up. Zero Barrier for example - what the hell is that? Freedom is ""off the Grid"" I mean pleeease! Jargon this implausible hasn't been heard since the British Government implored junkies not to shared their ""works"". Even taking into account the fact that I was hardly expecting Woody Allen, it's just awful.Special effects wail around the vacuum where the story is supposed to be, looking for something to do, looking for something to affect, looking to go bang. It's not surprising then that, many, many things bang in this film - and I'm not talking about Ben Afleck. Immediately following a distasteful little scene where our Bruce is driving golf balls at people in a Greenpeace boat, and playing it for the hilarious laughs such behaviour obviously deserves, his Oil Rig explodes. Then his test rig at NASA explodes, then the Russian Space Station, then a Space Shuttle, Then a Thermonuclear Device, followed shortly (and mercifully) by himself.Things go bang, then. Good basis for a multi-million dollar film project.But by far and away the most depressing thing about this film is the cast list. Leaving aside the bald one, whose occasional forays into the world of acting we already knew to be liberally interspersed with pap of the highest order, there's Steve Buscemi (not only a good actor, but a very decent director), Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Afleck, Michael Clarke Duncan, Jason Isaacs, Peter Stormare (who somehow manages to steal it, though give it back, I say) - I mean even Owen Wilson. Do none of these people know better? Obviously not.Some will no doubt say that I am being a curmudgeon, and that not all films need to explore the ""depths of humanity"". I agree.Unfortunately, this film does explore the depths of humanity, it just doesn't realise it's doing it. 2/10",Armageddon

Or how the shuttle and the armadillo can take massive impacts and escape essentially intact. To list all the inanities would exceed the allowed 1000 words.Basic plot is as old as the hills.

This is by far one of the most awesome and memorable disaster films of the 90's! And it is still very very enjoyable today. My kids who love rockets and space travel stories thoroughly enjoyed this as well.There's been a lot of complaints about it not being ""scientifically accurate"". I have 5 words for those people: THIS IS NOT A DOCUMENTARY! It's a movie! So long as the ""science"" is acceptable and believable to majority of audiences, and it is entertaining, then that's fine. This is not PBS or some Discovery channel documentary. I believe this genre is called ""Science FICTION"". Emphasis on the FICTION part. Sometimes what makes a good movie is not good science. Take Star Wars for example. Scientifically accurate? Heck no! Great movie? Totally! This goes for Armageddon. I like that instead of professional astronauts, they bring in a rag-tag team of oil drillers and those guys save the world. This movie packs excitement, awesome effects, a decent plot, and believable ""science fiction"". And it made me cry--which is saying a lot as I usually do not do that. Bruce Willi's character's sacrifice and the ""goodbye"" call to his daughter was very touching. His daughter putting her head down with her hand on the screen after they talked spoke volumes. This movie is awesome. If you've never seen it, GO AND WATCH IT! Or go watch it with people who've never seen it!",Armageddon

But there are good comic books and bad comic books, and Armageddon is like a glossy and expensively-printed comic book written and drawn by untalented and uncaring hacks.

Armageddon on a whole is simply terrible. Everything feels artificial and forced. Let's build sympathy for Bruce. Let's feel sorry for two young people in love who fornicate. Let's believe that NASA will send idiots into space to save the earth. All of the emotion in this film was so staged and fake, that it was hard to feel for these characters.

It does the job it says it will do, the effects are adequate, and the characters are funny.  I strongly advise that you take some aspirin before and after you see it, because this movie is a pounding assault on the senses.  I'm glad I didn't see it in a theater because everyone I talked to said that it was way too loud.  I laughed when I read that Disney executive Joe Roth said that they probably wouldn't have made this movie if they would've known how expensive it was going to cost.  I think what he MEANT to say was that they wouldn't have made it if they knew it was only going to make 200 million dollars in the U.S., because that was probably how much it cost.  No doubt they were expecting a $300+ million super blockbuster like ""Independence Day"" or ""Jurassic Park"".  Poor babies.

312,Brawl_666,jumpy camera + ADD editing = not good,6,16 June 2009,"I always watch a few minutes of this movie whenever its on, trying to understand the ""hatred"" that viewers supposedly have for Michael Bay films. I never do. I can only ever make sense of it by assuming that the masses need objects for communal hate, just as they do for communal love. In this way, Bay has unfortunately become an emblem of tasteless, disposable cinema. So Steven Spielberg = good, Michael Bay = bad. This mindset is what Orwell called the ""gramophone mind"". In principle there is little difference between the aforementioned two; Steven's films are only slightly less empty than those of Bay.On pure filmic grounds there is just one really huge problem that this movie has, and thats the editing style Bay adopts once we're in space. The jazzy, frayed film-cutting is very unpleasant, and, as it turns out, a poor choice. Because ironically, while its intended to pump up the volume, it actually makes the viewer numb and squanders any excitement the action scenes might generate. Such head-pounding montages add up to over an hour of the film. Other problems include an overkill of gay mano-a-mano moments. Liv Tyler is obnoxious. And, this movie essentially has no characterization; most of the characters are meatheads and have interchangeable dialogue.The money-men haven't held back; this is a massive, massive project. Apparently they got access to actual NASA labs and facilities. And Bay has shot it beautifully for the most part. The creepy asteroid is the most surreal and outlandish place we've been to since since the derelict spacecraft in Ridley Scott's 'Alien'. The Armadillo is as awesome as the Nolan Batmobile. I think that, with some reasonable adherence to space science and a leaner, more well-organized screenplay, this could have been a much more balanced movie. Bay's previous 'The Rock' is better, and also has great humor.The current generation of film viewers is a lazy one, having gotten used to relying on Tomatometer percentages rather than individually analyze & evaluate a film's merits & demerits. Armageddon is indeed an out-and-out corporate product, but it has undeniably inventive visuals. Image is the language of cinema, and if Kubrick is the Kafka of film, beginning the transformation of image grammar, then Bay must be kinda like Dickens, the master of conventional storytelling.The detractors of Armageddon are the equals of Jerry Falwell.",Armageddon

By the time this thing was over, I was praying for something substantive to happen, preferably in a quiet scenerio.But of course, given today's standards of whatever you can do-I can make louder-special effects, what else would you expect?How about characters we can like?  With the lone exception of Steve Buscemi(who I would like in anything), the characters were devoid of sympathy.  The Liv Tyler character was especially obnoxious.  I found myself fast-forwarding every scene she was in half way through the movie. Not a good sign.How about credibility?  It helps if the plot isn't so full of holes you could toss an asteroid the size of Texas through it. The entire scene on the asteroid was devoid of science, physics anything real(eg.,an astronaut's visor is broken and instead of his body exploding from lack of pressure, it just lays there, bleeding).Special effects alone do not make for good story.

Which, given the talented cast and the promising concept, is a tremendous shame.While I was annoyed by the multitude of scientific errors, I tried to sit back and enjoy the movie as harmless entertainment... but the irritatingly bad camera work, annoying characters, and contrived plot made that impossible.

NASA decides that the only course of action is to plant a nuclear warhead deep into the asteroid to split it in two hoping it will safely pass Earth. They send a team of oil drillers led by Bruce Willis to drill the hole and save the Earth.This is a great disaster movie utilising the directing skills of Michael Bay, a great action movie director and when teamed with producer Jerry Bruckheimer they create some of the best action films around. The effects in this film are incredible with an out of this world storyline and a cast of greats that includes Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, Owen Wilson, Steve Buscemi, Michael Clarke Duncan, William Fichtner & Will Patton. All great actors and all bring so much to the film, but the greatest performance is by Steve Buscemi who steals every scene he is in playing the character of Rockhound.This is an effects heavy film, but it works. The film is about chaos and destruction and the effects are relentless in the portrayal of the destruction. The spectacle of smaller asteroids crashing down to Earth is amazing to watch. Many people were put off with the effects of chaos and mayhem, but the film wouldn't have worked without it. However this film manages something most sci-fi films fail in. It manages to get you emotionally involved. I know many people that got teary eyed at the end of the film and that is something rare in a sci-fi/action film.This is a big budget blockbuster and it succeeds in every way. If you are a fan of action or sci-fi films then this is truly one not to miss out on. If you feel that with effects less is more, then this may be the wrong film for you. Try a rom-com!",Armageddon

I am confident in saying that not one complete minute of this film is plausible, or even remotely believable. Some sci-fi films are far-fetched (i.e. ""The Matrix"" or ""Blade Runner"") that still retain at the very least internal logic. I hated the crappy sentimentality. Not for a second did I buy any of the emotional content of this film. I hated the ridiculously unnecessary camera-work. The camera is never static, and there is no legitimate reason for it to be so. I hated the fact that the film contained good actors (Thornton, Willis, and possibly Aflac) that were playing silly roles. To say that they were cardboard cutouts is to insult cardboard cutouts.

Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck did a good job on this movie. It has more FX shots than i've ever seen on any other movie this year, except maybe, Godzilla. The soundtrack is fantastic. The best song couldn't be any other than ""I don't wanna miss a thing"", by Aerosmith. This is one of the best movies of 1998, rivalled only by The Prince of Egypt and A Bug's Life. People say that movies like this are nothing more than poor crap. I strongly disagreee. A movie like this is meant for entertaiment.

As a series of images that flicker at me faster than any other film or even music video I've ever seen, it is a unique experience. This may be the only film where any 2 minute sequence taken right out of the film could be used as a trailer for the film itself. I don't think any of the main characters are absent from the film for longer than a minute. The acting is b-movie standard. The special effects are pretty good for 1998. Whenever I see this movie on TV, I watch it to the end, bitter and disgusted, but fascinated. A car wreck fails as an analogy because they are not quite as entertaining and nowhere near as fascinating. As an example of the Bay and Bruckheimer excess style of film-making, it might be the best, because it is science fiction and action combined in a manipulatively effective way.

The cast (other than Ben Affleck and Michael Clarke Duncan) are decent. Even Bruce Willis can be good once in a while (Pulp Fiction, 12 Monkeys). But, this whole movie is just a big formulaic, predictable, melodramatic turd. How can a movie that was this expensive to make with a massive special effects budget and all these talented actors be SO utterly boring and just plain bad? It is so very, very BAD. It must be the Michael Bay touch. He has to be the worst American director of his generation. He is to America what Uwe Boll is to Retardland or wherever the hell he comes from. I've got a great idea! An action-horror film directed by Bay and Boll! It would star Steven Seagal and Sandra Bullock with Whoopi Goldberg as the comedic relief! It would be based on Grand Theft Auto and Donkey Kong where two hard-nosed cops have to fight off a mutant gorilla that attacks Florida!",Armageddon

324,thirdi,"Heavy on the cheese, but still fun",6,8 March 2004,"I'm a sucker for disaster movies. As for ""Armageddon"", I can see why a lot of people dislike Michael Bay films, he pretty much represents the current state of Hollywood big-budget mainstream movies. However, I like to think I'm not a ""film snob"" who automatically hates anything that Michael Bay does just because it is big-budget Hollywood fare. Yes, most of his movies are shallow exercises in corniness; unrealistic, garish, obvious and over the top. The style over substance argument is a valid one. But it is foolish to write off any movie strictly because of where it comes from. And sometimes they turn out to be a lot of fun, and very entertaining. Besides, disaster films just have an inherent corniness built into them, as the all time cheese-fest ""Titanic"" proved (James Cameron gets a free pass, he's still a genius). Truly, since the ""Airport"" and ""Towering Inferno"" movies from the 70's, isn't this really what we should expect from disaster flicks?Probably so, and such is the case with ""Armageddon"", one of the ultimate hokey-but-fun disaster movies ever. I often have to remind myself to judge a movie for what it is, or more to the point what it is meant to be, not for what you want it to be. And using that logic I was able to really enjoy this movie. First of all, you have to admit it's just a fascinating subject. Yes it's been done before (no less than in the same year with ""Deep Impact""), but I can never get enough asteroid/comet stories. They set up the impending doom nicely here and Billy Bob Thornton is excellent as our NASA guide to the end of time. There's very little scientific explanation of the asteroid/comet threat on screen, but they throw us enough bones to get into the story.The problems with ""Armageddon"" lay mostly with the characters. Most of them are kind of annoying. But some of them are very likable (Billy Bob, Bruce, Owen and Will Patton mainly). The special effects may not have been realistic, but they're still great to look at. Lots of corny dialogue, but amazingly there are some genuinely tender moments that pull at the heartstrings as well. The kid with the toy space shuttle, that got me. They didn't really focus much on the social effects of such an event, instead opting to make it an adventure film about dudes landing on a comet. Which is fine, although some of the sequences did drag. And its hard to keep track of all the minor disasters that occur while these guys are trying to stop the big disaster. The biggest problem of all, of course, is the fact that oil-diggers would never replace astronauts on a mission like this. But again, turning part of your brain off is key to appreciating movies like this.""Armageddon"" works because it's fun escapism, that's what it's supposed to be. Not every indie film is a ""gem"", just as not every heavily marketed studio movie is complete crap. Big budget Hollywood still manages to pump out a decent movie now and again. And once in a while a few breakthrough and distinguish themselves from the parade of trash that the idiot studio execs green-light. If you've forgotten this or gotten too ""film school cool"" to remember, go back and watch ""Die Hard"". As for comet movies, if I had to choose, I liked ""Deep Impact"" a little bit more, although it had issues too. Overall, ""Armageddon"", despite its problems, is still worth seeing.",Armageddon
325,Artêmis,One asteroid in our patience,2,28 August 1999,"I decided to watch Armaggedon after seeing the music in the TV and after my friends told me this movie was good (remark: my friends are teenagers with anything in their heads). So, I went with my sister to watch it. I was expecting one beautiful movie where the people, knowing that the world would end, tried to use their last minutes as good as they could.  You know, one movie that could make we cry. But no! All the movie is centralized in the ""astronauts"", all silly and rude man. It's interesting that knowing that the world would end in some days, all were very happy, and funny, and doing jokes one with the other. Even one scene that looks romantic (in the tv clip, without sound), when Ben Affleck is in one farm with Liv Tyler, is ridiculous. They are in the lawn and Ben start to talk, with a biscuit in his hands: ""I really don't think that the animal cracker qualifies as a cracker."" Liv asks why and he answers: ""Well cause it's sweet, which to me suggests cookie, I mean well putting cheese on something is sort of a defining characteristic of what makes a cracker a cracker. I don't know why I thought of that, i just-"". Isn't that ridiculous? Yes, but that was the most intelligent scene in all the movie. If you like special effects, don't watch this movie, they appear only in 5 minutes. Sci-fi? No, Armaggedon is really, believe me, a comedy. But if you like comedy... Don't go to. Why? During one hour they stay in the asteroid trying to destroy it. And I almost slept! In fact, don't waste your money in this film. It's really horrible. I'm sure there's something better to do!

Now, since I like a lot of bad things, I normally don't presume to disparage anyone who likes something I don't--that's what makes the world go 'round.

If you liked them, OK.I don't care about the stupid errors like fire in space, or implausible plot points...whatever, I can enjoy stupid errors and not diminish my movie-going fun.I will pass on the absolutely inept Ben Affleck. Someone sometime decided this loser could act. Let me ask--has he been in one decent movie since ""Good Will Hunting""? And I am NO GWH fan, by the way.I don't even care about the gloppy fake sentiment at the end, the goopy silly over the top nonsense when the asteroid is imminent and mankind is about to get wiped out.What gets me is the idiotic dialogue, the absolute unwatchably awful words that every decent actor in the movie is forced to gag out, grimacing. How did people like Steve Buscemi get stuck in this turkey? He was in Con Air--wasn't that loud and stupid and bombastic enough? The hideous editing--is there a shot in the movie lasting more than eight seconds? Seriously. SERIOUSLY. The deafening music. The dreadful, dreary scenic design. Did I mention the unwatchably bad script? You know, Michael Bay, you're the least talented person on this earth, and the luckiest.

It's Armageddon the second of two asteroid death movies released in 1998 the other being the kind of really boring realistic one with Morgan Freeman as president being the only crap I remember about it. This one is much more memorable, I don't it's less depressing to watch and Armageddon has all these good quotes that I remember from it and Deep Impact doesn't. I mean I know the movie knows nothing about how science works and blah, blah, blah. People, don't always go to the movies for extreme realism you morons and that's what Armageddon does it tells a exciting story that you may find annoying or improbable but it's exciting. I like the characters, it's my cup of tea sorry, I don't expect much out of big blockbuster disaster movie, it isn't going to change the world you idiots. I just find it better than Deep Impact and certainly better than most of the negative opinions and I think they should lay off on Bay and stop this crap about him.

I can't help but say, more than one decade later, that the less known, less hyped Deep Impact was a far, far better movie than Armageddon among the stream of disaster movies of the time (Volcano, Twister etc.)It is a linear, predictable (if you have a little brains and put them to use) movie. Is it enjoyable? Surely, it is a perfect move to take a date with, or to watch at home while texting and chatting. There are few, if any, inside references or loops on the story. The first 10 minutes give you all the character nuances you will need.As for the special effects, they are nice but thankfully they avoid the ""Independence Day-trap"" of killing even a shallow storyline for the sake of showcasing the ability of its visual effects engineers.To sum it up, Armageddon is a typical summer action movie, not much concerned about complexity. In that purpose, it delivers on its promises.",Armageddon

But still entertaining.,7,7 April 2005,"Armageddon is the story of a team of oil drillers who end up becoming a space crew that must destroy an asteroid the size of Texas which will destroy the earth. There, I just gave you the whole film synopsis in a nutshell. This is one of those flicks where you just have to sick back and enjoy it. You have to throw some of the things you expect from serious filming to the curve because it is obvious that the directors did the same thing.The film defines what a summer film should be. Mindless and more mindless while making the audience laugh and cry. There is a saying that the majority of the nation's moviegoers go to the movies to get a break from reality. Moviegoers want to be shocked. They want to laugh. To cry. To have their life changed. But I digress. On with the review. We have explosions. Explosions. And in case you missed it the first time, more explosions. There are plenty of laughs, witty lines, and funny situations. And unless you're some stone hearted person, the ending of the film will get a tear or two from you. I thought the montage of Harry Stamper's daughter's life(which is in turn his life in a way) flashing before his eyes before he blows up the asteroid(and gives his life as a result) is one of the most touching moments of film I've ever seen. It always makes me emotional. I highly regret not seeing this film in theaters.7/10",Armageddon

335,dsgraham212002,A seizure-inducing crapfest...,1,29 August 2015,"There are few films I truly loathe, as I am a connoisseur of the 'so bad it's good' genre of movie-making. This distinction, however, is nearly always applied to low-budget grade-Z schlock and sci-fi. ""Armageddon"" had a humongous budget of $140,000,000 in 1998 (I'd like to know the chunk of change that went into Bruce Willis' pocket). This movie defies belief in some ways, and has qualities that warrant my loathing: 1) Editing from hell. The jump-cutting and jarring editing throughout this film could have been dangerous to some (seriously); e.g. epileptics (seizures)and bipolar people such as myself (inducing a manic episode). As I struggled through this thing, annoyance can hardly describe the what the images displayed so frenetically on screen did to me and I hadn't received my diagnosis yet back then.2) The utterly-preposterous storyline. I know, I know, it's science fiction but the plotting and side stories go beyond the absurd and ridiculous. The people recruited for the mission are as stereotypically-contrived as they come. None of this stuff is believable, for one second. I think even a hint of believability should be necessary to drive a plot. Perhaps that was the point, but it didn't work for this reviewer.3) Bruce Willis. I begrudgingly liked him in ""Unbreakable"", ""The Sixth Sense"", and the first ""Die Hard"" film but here he's just a macho schmuck. As John McClain, Mr. Willis was a true bad-ass who, through tremendous perseverance and over-the-top police work, you wanted to see kick those villainous terrorist's cumulative butts; here, you want to see him REALLY get hurt to shut him up.4) Billy-Bob Thornton. I loved this guy in ""Sling Blade"" a few years before, where his mentally-challenged character, Karl Childers, was a wonder to behold. Original and moving, that movie was his; here, you almost expect him to wink at the audience at his un-dynamic choice of roles here. His character has NOTHING TO DO. He's wasted, as maybe he was in another way during this film's shooting schedule.5) The director, Michael Bay. Oh my, what this man has done to film-making. Overblown, over-hyped, over-everything-ed, and ultimately mind-numbing pap for the masses. A popcorn flick you say? I'd gag on it, watching this case of celluloid dreck. I'd strongly prefer a cheaply-made bug-eyed monster flick from the 50s on You Tube, instead.",Armageddon
336,Calios,A good but mixed up save-the-planet movie,8,15 June 2000,"Enjoyed this action, puppy love romance movie. The save-the-planet plot is great, but the little subplots or character personalities makes it somewhat unrealistic. The actors do a good job of depicting the people that the story calls for, but they're a little more off the wall than what is believable.
Why is it any time a Hollywood movie has to put together a group of ordinary, hard working, regular joes (men) they have to have weird and out-in-leftfield personalities. This is the case in this movie. Not to give away part of the movie, but I find it surprising that in the days before actual liftoff that none of the ""guys"" quit or kills himself, as is the case most of the time when real people are thrust in such a demanding spot.Bruce Willis is very believable in his role and made me cry when he had to. The plot twisted very nicely and the special effects were adequate in making me believe in the rock in outer space. Billy Bob Thorton did a good job and I am gradually gaining respect for his ability as he seems to have just appeared over the last few years. The actor who was the pilot of Bruce's shuttle did an exceptional job in projecting his character, and the unhearlded role of the cosmonaut, who is a major factor in the movie is great. Ben Affelat was somewhat lame, but that could have as much to do with the way his character was written than with him. His love interest in the movie did her part as the ungrateful and big-headed daughter who eventually but too late turns around returning her love for her father. Never knew how important the word ""Daddy"" was till this movie.Worth seeing and the bigger the screen the better. Great popcorn eating movie.

Armageddon is a high budget science fiction with an ensemble cast mostly playing the best deep drillers of the world to save the plight of this planet from the impending meteoric....well.....""Armageddon"". Its got all three ingredients of most movies - action, laughter and emotion - although each in their own capricious quantities. Michael Bay doesn't need an introduction and neither does his work. He is one of the best action movie directors who can really pack a punch behind his action. This movie is definitely up there with ""The Rock"" and ""Face/Off"". No character development or depth in the storyline, but why would one need it in a Michael Bay action production? Armageddon has got some astonishing special effects, edge of the seat action, is funny at times, a talented star cast, mushy emotions, moneys worth and well ... space shuttles too!

Ben Affleck is so bad that he has the ability to single-handedly ruin a movie. Although he wasn't even the worst part about this. I have a sneaking suspicion that NASA isn't going to leave the fate of the world into a bunch of nobodies after about a minute of training. Bruce Willis is wooden, as usual, Liv Tyler's acting is hilarious and Ben Affleck, well, he was Ben Affleck. Steve Bushemi, who I normally like, was annoying, but I blame that on the writers. That scene with Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler and the animal crackers was easily one of the most embarrassing in the history of film. ""Deep Impact"" has some similar clichés in it. The goodbyes at the end, the astronauts sacrificing themselves, etc., but it was still mildly entertaining. This movie was just an embarrassment. Liv Tyler trying to act sad at the end actually made me feel bad for her, because if it was me acting that badly, and I went back and watched, I wouldn't want to go on living. Probably the worst part of it was that Aerosmith song that makes me want to shove knitting needles in my ears to end the torment.

My classmates don't appreciate movies. They just get mad at movies, act like they know everything about movies, and continue to see them anyway. Here's what's wrong with them:1. They were in no mood to care about the characters. (I thought they were great! Bruce Willis gives another great performance in his career!. I loved the other cast too.) 2. They are obsessed with realism. They bash all over flames in space, explosions, and screaming, and they don't see how in movies, that you're allowed to do that. Movies were made to help you escape from reality. I wanted to believe there were flames in space, and sound after this movie. 3. They criticize the machineguns. The macineguns were there to shoot at the smaller asteroids. I thought the machineguns were cool. What are they wondering about why they're there for? 4. They make fun of the script, drama, and other meanings in this film. But they mean so much to me. I know I'm not crazy by saying this, because I compared myself with crazy people, and I'm sane.

There were great performances all around the cast. Goingback to a part in this review, Armageddon is not about specialeffects, and the other elements are not cheap excuses for that.Armageddon was about its story. Bruce played a man who feltthat he didn't raise his daughter right and didn't want her tomarry a person like him.

While Independence Day took every Hollywood action movie cliche & wove it into the movie ride of the summer, Armageddon threw all their tired cliches into a blender & came out with a mess.

348,Nash,"Godawful, maybe the worst ever",1,21 April 1999,"Possibly the worst movie ever. The worst part about it is that it throws out any of the tenants of story telling.  Movies are a story telling medium using visuals and sound.  Nothing mattered and very little was explained.  I will use only one example but it is really glaring one.  How did they break through those hundreds of feet of rock when they couldn't do anything for hours and suddenly they were almost done?  It was just a bunch of scenes thrown together. Constant mayhem does not substitute for plot and characterization. Next is the horrid editing.  There were so many shots most of the time I could not tell what was going on. The sound was just loud.  I am surprized no one died of an anuerism.Most of the ""acting"" was laughable.  Could Liv Tyler have flown any farther over the top.  Could Ben Affleck and Bruce Willis have been any more wooden?The other thing is it wanted to be a ""message movie"" about heroism without a hint of subtlety.  I did get a good laugh at how badly this was handled.  And for taking itself seriously the film won't even have any lasting camp value.And don't try to call me a pretentious art film lover.

349,buddhadan-1,Awful and loud at it,3,15 September 2006,"I remember thinking that due to the cast, the subject matter, and the director, I was going to love this movie.Stepping into the theatre and taking my seat, I was like a giddy schoolgirl as my anticipation for the opening scene built.I was not disappointed with the opening and felt that I was truly going to love this movie.If you haven't seen the movie and feel that anything that gives away scenes might be seen as a spoiler, please stop reading. I'm not going to give away anything really important, but it might be seen as such, so that is the warning.Spoiler may be included below, beware.I think that the first scene that really hit me as just utterly ridiculous was the Russian space station scene. I mean honestly, refueling a shuttle with no real prior warning, and then to simply show the station as being so fragile that a simple little mistake can cause the entire thing to just explode.While all of this is possible, it seemed to me to be way over the top. I'm not sure if it was just the situation or if it was the cheesy acting, the silly view of the Russian technology, or just the campy attitude of the scene itself.It only got worse for me after that because then we endure what seemed like 2 hours of constant super loud explosions in space...you know, that place where there is no sound because it's a vacuum.But the coup de grace for me, honestly, was the gun scene. (spoiler possibility) - Earlier in the movie, we see Bruce Willis tearing apart their land vehicle (the vehicle that they will use to drive around in when they get there and to help them drill) when he is told that this is what they will be using. He is taking pieces off and complaining about it because much of what's on it is heavy and not required for what they are doing.So then, as we are wandering onto the asteroids, we see that they have opted to add a massive gatling like gun to the vehicles...you know, standard NASA fare is to have heavy weaponry on all space missions in case, you know, aliens or something.I could have taken the explosive 2 hours, the silly Russian space station refueling scene, the cheesy love scene near the end, the Bruce Willis character being nothing more than most of his other past characters, but the Steve Buscemi going mad and shooting the space vehicle's gun all over the place and causing havoc/damage, well that threw the entire thing over the top for me.Save your money and time and avoid this movie.

However... I re-watched Armageddon on TV a few nights ago and now, ten years after it was unleashed, I feel I can take a more pragmatic view.Most of the articulate and intelligent reviews that have already been written cover off the preposterous nature of the science which underpins the woeful script. For example, the varying degrees to which gravity obeys the laws of dramatic tension rather than the laws of physics, the absolute necessity to have some serious Gatlin guns mounted on the drilling vehicles (what were they expecting  annoyed aliens?), the ludicrous notion that NASA would let the moronic men-children anywhere within fifty miles of a shuttle - rather than simply train their own highly disciplined astronauts to operate a drill, the cardboard cut-out Russian cosmonaut whose script direction read ""SHOUTING"" at the beginning of each line. And... nukes with big green countdown read-outs on them, 12-inch diameter drills that make 36-inch diameter holes, Earth shorn of time-zones and the amazing a ability to put on sun-glasses whilst wearing a space-suit helmet. You get the gist, the list is endless.All these and many other inconsistencies, inaccuracies and failures of reason are just about forgivable if the movie delivers what it is meant to, which on some levels it does, I suppose. The thing that really gets me though, and this is the bit that I find pretty unforgivable, is that the makers of the movie assume that I (and you) are morons who will let these issues go without questioning. Maybe for some of the Cletuses and Darlenes out there  well, OK. But the vast majority of us average intelligence movie goers will say, ""Whoa, hold on buddy. Do you expect me to swallow that premise or this notion?"" To which Bay and his ilk say, ""Sure, why not, eat your popcorn."" That's what really irks me.

Ok, flying into space to plant a nuke on an asteroid to blow it up may be a little far fetched, but not entirely unbelievable, so does the idea of sending up a drilling specialist to oversee the task. But sending up a whole crew of misfits from an oil rig is totally unbelievable. If the world was in so much peril, do you actually think the government would take a gamble of such grand proportions?

Oh yes, our American, down to earth boys are going to save the world, who else? The wipeout of a city like Paris is only good for a nice FX and that it might be useful to get help from the rest of the world never occurs to the NASA scientists. Well, if you've seen ""Deep Impact"" you know the drift.Then let's talk about physics - the way it is treated in this movie would make Mr. Newton spin in his grave. Gravity on an asteroid the size of Texas? And apparently just as much as on earth, the way the protagonists moved? Well, to get that going the asteroid would have to have the weight of Earth on as much room as Texas has. The density would be so high that no matter if you used a 10000 watt drill or a toothpick to dig a hole the result would be the same. But somehow the gravity also seemed to fade out on story-line convenience, when one of the landing vehicles is able to drift over a wide valley on the asteroid by a little thrust of its boosters. We are not even talking about ""why"" these vehicles were armed with heavy guns.Now about the actors: Liv Tyler is a fine young woman, although not a fine young actress. Bruce Willis as her father is like Arnold Schwarzenegger as Ghandi. Overall the entire cast seemed to not really know what they actually should be portraying, so the fault might not be on the actors, but on the bad storyline.If this movie would not pretend that it has to be taken serious, you could actually enjoy it - as a movie rental for a boring Saturday night.

The worst thing about the movie is that it managed to make every character extremely annoying and obnoxious, maybe with the exception of Willis and Tyler.  If everyone except Willis died on the mission, I would've been happy; unfortunately, it worked in the opposite way.And one more thing: I couldn't keep a straight face throughout the movie (a mixture of disbelieving laughter and frowns) since they started talking about drilling a hole into the asteroid.  Right.  Then just watching them actually do the drilling, in space, on an asteroid traveling really fast towards the earth is a priceless bit of comedy; unfortunately, the movie was not meant to be a comedy.  The idea is as absurd as Silvester Stallone playing an arm wrestling big rig driver.I really hate this movie.  On a scale of one to ten, I give it a zero.

358,24540647,Why the harsh words for a GREAT film?,9,10 June 2003,"Sorry, but I read many of these comments and wonder if it's the same film. Everyone I know considers this one of Bruce's best films.  He's finally playing the lead without all the usual macho crap.An asteroid heading for Earth (not new), only one possible chance for survival (again, not new), a bunch of weirdo's from an oil rig to save the world (new!)Who can watch the scenes during the NASA medical checks without laughing, and who can watch the end without a tightening of the throat?  My girlfriend recently turned on the TV 15 minutes before the end of the film and was still in tears at the finish!All in all, a really good film to kick bad and relax with.

359,presence,BAMMO!!!!!!!,8,23 December 1998,"Wow, what an EXPLOSIVE movie.  This movie was everything I expected it to be: action packed and plot deprived.  There wasn't a very interesting plot to the movie, as it just tells the story about a bunch of oil drillers trying to save the world.  That's the basic plot in a nutshell, and it is quite far fetched if not utterly stupid.  Armageddon makes up for it's lack of plot with it's explosive special effects and action sequences.  This movie provides large doses of suspense and adrenaline leaving the audience breathless or dizzy.  Some of the scenes happen so fast that it's hard to tell what's going on, and vomiting seems like an inevitability.  If action is your thing, and you really want to see things get blown to hell, this movie is your thing.  You will see New York get pummeled by a barrage of meteorites, and beautiful Paris disintegrate before your eyes.  However, if you're looking for a movie with a decent plot and some interesting characters, look elsewhere.  You'll just sit through the movie wishing you brought aspirin.  Because I'm a fan of movies like this, I gave this movie an 8 out of 10.",Armageddon

Sure it tries to tug your heartstrings but ultimately it cannot achieve such depth no matter how hard it tries. This movie is what Top Gun would have been like if a chimp directed it.

362,FlorianSchirner,Can't understand the critics,8,10 February 2009,"OK, first I admit, I love this movie! That said, i wonder about the strong hate-critics this movie got, even here on IMDb. Some criticise the shallowness. Hey, it never intended to be a drama that teaches us a moral lesson. It even sets it straight, from the beginning, that it touches the meteor-crashes-on-earth subject way more unrealistic than movies like Deep Impact or Meteor, which are surreal too they just pretend to be more realistic.Some critics said that great actors were wasted in small, insignificant roles. Well, first, no one forced these actors to take the roles. Then some, like Duncan or Wilson, were not at their peak back then. And I must say that even Owen Wilson's role (the most insignificant in my opinion) has its highlights. And some roles (esp. Affleck's and Thornton's) have more depth than in other popcorn movies. I find the general acting level quite strong, considering the type of movie. Of course we have seen deeper performances from Willis, Duncan, Stormare, Buscemi and Thornton, but those were in other genres.Some say it claims only the NASA and thus the USA could deal with any crisis....well this is an American movie. And the USA are still the biggest movie market. I guess that if this movie would have been made by a Chinese company and filmed in China it would show China as the superior nation. One critic here claimed that the movie showed only blond white American kids rejoicing at the meteor's destruction. As I recall it this is plain wrong. Celebration all over the world is shown.I find this movie quite entertaining, which is the ultimate goal a movie should aim for. It may have some weak moments, but it is just so cheesy and pushed beyond every reality that it becomes funny, tense and emotional. I especially love the scenes of the Affleck/Tyler relationship which are sweet, romantic but not too cheesy. Foremost the goodbye scene with the rendition of ""Leaving on a Jet plane"".So...if you can enjoy an entertaining movie which never pretends to be intellectual and is solidly made, watch Armageddon.",Armageddon

Also, let's forget that there are no astroids the size of Texas in this solar system. So right off from the start; the movie is too stupid to be taken seriously. Anyone who really understands physics and astronomy will have a good laugh at this movie's expense.Let's move on to all that other stuff in a movie (story, characters, special effects). All of them are poorly done and some of them are at an absurd level of silliness. Yet, you can tell that the director is taking this movie seriously and expects us to.

368,jaylewis-2,"Don't insult our intelligence, Hollywood!",1,5 January 1999,"I'll be the first to admit two things, firstly that I am very critical of movies and second that I am a cynical person. I owe the first attribute to the fact that I've seen a lot of movies. And one reason that I'm cynical is movies like Armageddon. I hated this movie more than even ""Howard the Duck,"" ""Surf Ninjas,"" or ""Dracula: Dead and Loving It."" Why hate this movie? First of all, in a summer that featured masterpieces like ""The Truman Show"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" plus good movies like ""There's Something About Mary,"" ""54,"" and ""Deep Impact,"" this piece of trash was the top-grossing movie. (By the way, ""Deep Impact"" was a surprisingly good movie.) Second of all, it's rehash. I'm getting extremely tired of these disaster movies. This is the third ""...there's an asteroid/comet heading towards earth!"" movie released in the last two years. Aside from movies like ""Asteroid"" and ""Deep Impact,"" there have been similar theme movies as well. There was ""Volcano,"" ""Dante's Peak,"" and yes, I would even count ""Titanic"" as the same genre. Third, we come to the movie itself. For lack of a better word, ""garbage"" is the best description I can think of. It has a sappy Hollywood romance to appease the female viewers while at the same time, it has an equally stupid and unbelievable action part to keep the male viewers from being too bored. In this aspect, it is much like ""Titanic,"" although at least ""Titanic"" made some semblance of an attempt at a realistic presentation of the action sequences. ""Armageddon"" was boring, unrealistic, and unoriginal while at the same time showing some of the most pathetic acting skills I've ever seen making it the absolute lowest of the low in my book. Hollywood knows just which buttons to push to create a movie that supposedly everyone will like while keeping the brain work to a minimum. It is a sad but true fact. On a scale of 1-10, this movie gets a 1, and it was lucky to earn that.",Armageddon

373,john_murdoch2002,Five reasons to not recommend this movie,1,5 July 2002,"When I first saw this movie in the theaters back in 1998, I left the theater not remembering a single moment from the film. Watching it again on television, I began to remember the film more vividly in all of its disgusting and audience-insulting decadence. By watching it again, I discovered five reasons to advice everyone to stay as far away from this film as possible.Reason number one: The movie is schizophrenicThe story is about a crew of drillers sent to destroy an asteroid heading for earth. Pretty simple, huh? But this mess of a film is so sloppily put together by Michael ""Ed-Wood-Reincarnate"" Bay, that it comes across as unbalanced. Many will argue that this is supposed to be a summer film, so we'll compare it to other summer films. Is it supposed to be a free-for-all action film in the sense of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark?"" Then why does it get so melodramatic with the characters instead of allowing their individual quirkiness to run rampant? Or is it supposed to be a more serious adventure in the way that ""Apollo 13"" was? If so, then why doesn't the script display one ioda of technical knowledge of space? Listen to the NASA commentary on the Criterion DVD and you'll hear for yourselves. So as a summer film, it fails to find it's feet.Reason number two: Who the hell are these people?Every great story has a character that we either like and want to see succeed or despise and want to see fail or crawl out from their rut. In ""Armageddon,"" all the characters are permanently stuck in a rut. Let's go through the cast: Bruce Willis, a stereotypical father who doesn't want the daughter to get involved with his best driller. Ben Affleck is the pretty boy who stares at pretty girl Liv Tyler with googly eyes throughout the film. ""Armageddon"" fails to give either Affleck and Tyler any sparks or any reason for Willis to resent Affleck (first he likes him, then he hates him, then he needs him, then he resents him, then he mourns him, then he takes pity on him - come to think about it, Affleck has a more believable love story going on with Willis than he does with Tyler). The rest of the cast seem to rely on stereotypes as well, wasting such talent as Michael Clarke Duncan, Steve Buscemi, Owen Wilson, et al as background, never really adding anything more than scenery to an already bland film.Reason number three: Ed Wood is alive, well, and directing Pearl HarborLet's try to rationally put these scenes together. Helicopters arrive at an oil rig during a sunset (sunrise, whatever), then two seconds later, it's day. Say it was a long trip, huh? How about the fact that every time a helicopter flies by in this film, the earth and sky are instantly painted orange, regardless of what the previous scene was? A little too convenient, no? Though some may argue that this is a trademark of Michael Bay, one should think that trademarks shouldn't have to rely on time and space in order to work properly. Sunsets are scenery. As for the set up of the shots; they are over-dramatic (soap operas have more subtle direction than Bay), poorly organized, and framed terrible. He always seems to be pointing the camera up at someone. Extra #4 does not always need a hero shot. A good director knows that a camera is merely a tool for a director to focus the audience's attention on something in a scene (a good example is to look at Robert Altman's direction of ""Gosford Park"" and notice how at least two things are taking place in one scene). As for the camera constantly moving the way that Bay likes it, this is not directing, this is overcompensating.Reason number four: ""Can you reach into the glove compartment and pull out my brain medicine?"" - Homer SimpsonMovies like ""Armageddon"" show little to no respect to an audience. They seem to say that if we shove a bunch of action scenes together, have a pop song on the radio, and worry little about the story, then the audience will see it. ""Armageddon"" is such a film that seems to have been constructed not by writers, but by a focus group and sales meetings that show the statistics of moneymakers. Yes, the Hollywood industry is just that, an industry, but it is also an art form and an entertainment forum. Bay has argued before that he likes to make films for audiences. If this is true, then he should stop trying to pound the audience into liking him with his overly boisterous films and focus more on telling the stories that he wants to tell like a competent director should. Remember, the great stories are the ones that can relate a deep story to a vast audience.Reason number five: The success of this film is the first step to the oblivion of good risk-taking films.As mentioned before, Hollywood is a business that wants to make money, which it should not be condemned for. Everyone wants to make money. Remember the immortal words of the good Affleck film ""Boiler Room"" when he said, ""whoever said money is the root of all evil doesn't have it."" But it's when these cookie-cutter movies become successful that we begin to see more dumbed-down films like them. If over-hyped and over-produced movies like this succeed, then it will open the door for other ""Die Hard on a subway"" and ""It's like Armageddon meets Tomb Raider"" pitched films. As an audience, we should demand more. We should demand more films that appeal to our intellect as well as our instincts. Movies have become depersonalized and we should encourage the filmmakers of today and tomorrow to tell stories that they enjoy. I will leave you with the final words spoken by Jay Sherman in ""The Critic"" when he said, ""If the movie stinks, just don't go.""",Armageddon
374,isenberg-e,Exciting despite major flaws,7,14 December 2002,"I have to admit a strong prejudice against science fiction films that are so scientifically inaccurate and unbelievable that they are embarrassing to those of us who actually like SF.

If you can't spot most or all of the flaws, then you probably don't care.Besides the above, most of the characters were so forgettable that when they died you couldn't remember what they looked like! Many of the scenes on the asteroid looked like what they were: indoor sets under harsh lighting. I could go on but you get the picture. Brainless mind pap.I must admit that despite everything I still enjoyed watching it (!) because of the off-the-top performances and some (but definitely not all) of the special effects.

377,Private Ryan-2,"Great disappointment, horrendous movie.",1,8 May 1999,"I truly don't know where to start listing all the things that are wrong with this flick. I left the theater with a terrible headache, and feeling totally insulted. Does Michael Bay consider his target audience to be 12 year-old kids with attention deficit disorder? I find no other explanation for the long succession of flops that comprise this movie.The story is weak, the acting is plainly horrendous, the shameless flag-waving is embarrassing, and the many plot-holes make the script look like the surface of the Moon.I especially had a problem with the ""suspension-of-disbelief"" issue. I understand that when you go see an action film, you need to give some credit to the storyline in order to be able to enjoy it. For example, nobody knows how an alien looks like, or even if there are aliens at all, but we see ""ET"" and it does not bother us; this is so because the story is superbly told. Everyone knows that not everyone can survive a major explosion, but if the story makes sense and it's well told, we suspend our disbelief, give the creators some credit, and enjoy the show.In ""Armageddon"" the (poorly developed) characters are surviving excrutiating life-threatening situations every two or three minutes. They always scape in the very last second, and most of the time totally unharmed. How trite! Once or twice is fine, but not every three minutes through the entire movie. It's cartoonish, and does nothing but to kill the magic that makes us enjoy movies: suspension of disbelief. How many explosions can they outrun? How many shots or ridiculously unbelievable situations can they scape without harm? Pleeeeeease! Of course, this is a Michael Bay product, so any attempt to analyze it in a logical way is pointless.I certainly did not enjoy the radical conservative undertones through the movie (blatant bashing of Green Peace, only men take action while the women wait at home and catch the action on the TV screen, etc.), and the constant flag-waving to the point of ridiculous. I'm as patriotic as the next guy, but I don't appreciate flag-waving for the wrong reasons, and this movie has plenty of them! Other nationalities are reduced to plain caricatures of overused stereotypes (I felt like gagging every time they showed muslims praying in-masse, African children running in the jungle and pointing at the sky -like in a Microsoft commercial-, or every time the Russian astronaut from the Mir station opened his mouth -there's so many awful stereotypes one can take in a single movie!). Then, to please the close minded crowd this movie was intended to appeal, the only asteroid that hits the earth destroys Paris, of all places!I'm pretty sure this movie was a great success among trailer-park dwellers, and Rush Limbaugh listeners nation-wide!",Armageddon
378,Winnie-6,State of the art,9,19 April 1999,"It does make me laugh when people compare this film to Deep Impact.  The films are not even similar apart from the initial storyline!  Armageddon is far, far superior in every way, shape and form.  Actors - Bruce Willis (superb), Billy Bob (brilliant), Steve Buscemi (comic of the year), Ben Affleck (hunky and gung ho) and the amazing Liv Tyler VS Tea Leoni (yeeooorrgghh), Robert Duvall (booooorriing), Elijah Wood (hmmmm, there is potential, just not in this film) Morgan Freeman (ok, one exception) and that annoying Carrie from ER (how cardboard can you get???) Special effects in Armageddon leave Impact for dead.  Impact is not remotely funny - Armageddon pumps up the comedy from every angle. AND most of all - Armageddon crew had access to NASA.  Impact had to rely on a shuttle launch that has been filmed by every other film-maker too. Armageddon may not be realistic but at least it is entertaining, emotional and Liv Tyler delivers the performance of a lifetime.",Armageddon
379,Winnie-6,Superb,9,14 October 1998,"Let's be serious, there is nothing particularly realistic about this film. For starters, what are the chances that those asteroids would hit downtown Manhattan!  We can be hopeful of course, but more than likely it would be some obscure part of Russia or Nth Canada.  I am straying from the point. This is an all-American, gung-ho film.  The music (Jerry Bruckheimer music is always similar) provides the hero feeling and seeing them in their flight suits makes us all proud. All in all, the performances were good (Bruce Willis the same as always though).  The special fx were fantastic.  But more than anything, for an action flick I found myself rather attached to the characters.  Especially Bear and A.J.  And I was glad to see they both survived.  I also shed a few tears for poor orphaned Grace, left to survive on her own (with a totally gorgeous fiancee). Overall, I think this was a great film.

381,Fletch-35,One of the true American movies...,8,8 June 1999,"For many, it's easy to bash and hate this wonderful film. I for one think that it's a touching and exciting action/dramatic film. It explores the thought of life and death, and the values that come in between.While the story maybe a little touchy for some ( remember this is only a movie folks ), the special effects and the masterful filmmaking of Michael Bay is what really is the heart of the film. Michael obviously takes pride in his work and his unique films show this quality. As with Bad Boys and the Rock, each of his films get better each time around.Armageddon, deals with the fact that we can work together to get things done, putting our differences aside as people, without confrontations. And how love can be a powerful thing to keep one strong, no matter how far away you are from that person.This movie was a blockbuster film in 1998, being the highest grossing film of the year, earning over $200 million. On video, it was the same hit.You obviously need to see this film on DVD, with a high quality surround sound system. A new version of Armageddon was released on DVD resently. It has uncut footage and interviews with cast and crew.Mixed reviews by some aside, Armageddon is an excellent film that will make you have a memorable adventure for two and a half hours.",Armageddon
382,Dr.Jolly,"A pretty good movie, until they take off into space.",6,13 July 1999,"You've got a disaster movie about an asteroid coming straight to Earth and a possibility of killing all human kind. Than you put Bruce Willis in the starring role and cast a wide collection of colorful supporting characters. With all this, it would be impossible to make a boring movie. In fact, this was beginning to be the best disaster movie since the Poseidan Adventure, but then they took off into space and this movie went all to hell. Bruce Willis basically plays himself as the best oil driller on Earth and is called up to destroy the asteroid heading to the Earth. Of course, Willis needs his crew to get the job done. Ben Affleck is a good young actor, but he needs to choose better roles, because all he does in this movie is place himself as a teen idol stud and not a promising actor. I think Liv Tyler is highly overrated not only in looks, but also abilities. Consider that Tyler was out-acted by Alicia Silverstone in the Aerosmith videos, that is very sad.Thankfully, led by Will Patton and Steve Buscemi, the rest of the crew is wonderful and sets this movie off with a bang during an excellent first half of the movie, showing them training and pulling off non-stop comedy and intelligent dialogue. But like I said before, than they had to take off. As soon as you see space in this film, it takes a huge nose dive. At this point, Billy Bob Thornton gains a big chunk of control in this movie and that isn't good. Thornton did a great job in Sling Blade, but since that he has virtually done a terrible job in anything since and this is no exception. The whole space mission is hobbled through the fact that too much happens with questionable possibilities. Buscemi goes AWOL, but somehow becomes a hero. Than you have to see Willis meet his fatal ending. It really sucks to see Willis die in anything. Plus, was it just me who notices that there space outfits change colors all the time while they're up in space? I don't know what they were thinking when they did the last hour or so of this film, but it seems like there were two directors and screen writers on this film. This movie is headed into history as being a great disaster film and turns into just a fun movie to watch for a while. Bruckheimer has yet to find anything as good as Top Gun still. I give this movie a 6 out of 10.",Armageddon
383,xteve,Terrible,4,10 October 2000,"I just saw this film last night and it is SO bad in SO many ways.  It takes the phrase ""suspension of disbelief"" to an entirely new level.The plot is 3rd grade gibberish. None of the actors save Billy Bob Thornton create characters that are worth rooting for, or memorable. It was damn near impossible to care about what happened to any of these people, as most of them were stereotype ""summer movie"" characters. The relationship between Bruce Willis' tough-guy father and Liv Tyler's stubborn daughter was improbably written and poorly acted. I had a hard time believing that people like those two could even exist, let alone have a relationship like they did.the special effects were good, there were a number of memorable CGI scenes but the editing for this movie was extremely annoying, I TOTALLY agree with the poster who said there are no scenes longer than 3 seconds.I was actually prepared to give this movie a 6 or 7, until the utterly contrived and vomit-inducing ending, which I won't even bother to spoil, anyone who loses 2 and a half hours of their life watching this pile of c**p deserves to see the ending.By the way I usually like Bruce Willis in almost anything, but his performance in this film is one of the most 1-dimensional, flatly uninspired I've ever seen.  Willis seemed to be taking lessons straight from the John Wayne school of acting, delivering even impassioned speeches in a wooden monotone.",Armageddon
384,artgutierrez,The ultimate turn-off-your-brain movie,4,6 July 2021,This is the type of film that your head will explode if you use your brain while watching it. It's as poorly written as it is acted. But it doesn't fail to entertain (as long as you don't think about pesky things like why is there fire in outer space?... Or why didn't NASA just train their astronauts to drill instead?... Or why was Michael Bay involved in this?),Armageddon
385,kheops,Special effects does not make a film. Buscemi does,3,7 December 1998,"After an half hour quite good, fun. The film goes in the recurrent default of American blockbusters today : we can't do anything without Americans. They're here to save the world. The beginning was quite cool. You see about ten guys all unable mentally to behave, fat, bad shaved, smelly. And they're going to save us.After that, they go in the space, Bruce Willis sacrifices himself and Ben Affleck gets married with Liv Tyler. The end. It's too short to make a film. Michael Bay gives us his personnal vision of the rest of the world. Just stereotypes, postcards of China, India, France...Who expects USA to save the World. There are no surprises. You know at the beginning everything what will happen. Bruce Willis saves the world but Steve Buscemi saves the film with his sense of humour and way of acting. He's the only surprise. You spend your time to ask yourslef why Michael Bay films like that. The views are very ugly. he tores the camera, he puts tear-panda-music and he thinks it can make a film. Michael Bay can thank Steve Buscemi without this ""thing"" would have been worse than ""Godzilla"", ""Independance day"" and ""Stargate"" reunited.This movie sucks.2 on 10",Armageddon
386,da_lowdown,"Plausability, all we ask for is a bit of plausibility",3,11 March 2006,"I like big dumb action movies. They do entertain. Suspending disbelief is part of the requirement for enjoying this type of flick. But they should at least make an effort, please at least a little, at making it plausible. This movie makes minimal, if any, effort at doing so. Here is a short list of some of the inexplicable stupidity (presented in free-form quick-cuts, just like the movie): fire in space(need oxygen for that kids), gravity on an asteroid, an asteroid the looks more like a comet, exploding debris from a space station that leaves neighboring shuttles untouched, space suits that never run out of oxygen, apparent wind (in space) blowing the smoke and vapors from the shuttle crash.Oh, and don't get me started on the clichéd action sequences and bad dialog. This review would go on and on, and I would bore you, but probably not as bad as this loud flashy stinker would.Only the decent special effects saved this from hitting bottom with me.",Armageddon
387,north-julie,my favourite film of all time- enjoyable from start to finish,10,10 June 2005,"I was twelve when this appeared in cinemas. Me and my cousin had the choice of seeing this, Lost in Space or Godzilla. I wanted to see Lost in Space, and my cousin wanted to see Godzilla. In the end we came to a compromise; we'll see Armageddon. It looked decent enough, and its advert was on the t.v in every ad break so we though Why Not? Suffice to say, I'm glad we went to see this.Starting with a spectacular scene of destruction involving a space shuttle, moving onto a spectacular scene of destruction in New York, and then bringing us into touch with the plot, this film never once lets up with its pace. Its so fast and energetic, and you never have time to ponder any inaccuracies or errors. If we want to be highly entertained, this will suit you to a tee.Performance wise, this film hits every note on the head. Bruce Willis has always been a great actor to me, and in Armageddon he excels as cynical, hard edged and deeply patriotic father Harry Stamper. His daughter Grace is played by Liv Tyler, a beautiful girl who has been very understated in her role. Credit where credits due, she carries the slower more thoughtful earthside scenes well, linking to great effect with the impressive Bill Bob Thornton. Some people have said that Armageddon didn't give enough focus to what was happening on Earth while the asteroid was being dealt with, but Tyler and Thornton cover their end well.Ben Affleck. He's always had that slightly annoying presence, and recent flops haven't helped him either. But here, back in 1998 when he was given fourth billing in a Michael Bay movie, as opposed to when he was first billed in Michael Bays Pearl Harbour, he is actually quite likable. Not having to carry a movie is better for him, as lets face it he won't ever win a best actor Oscar. Here though, he is quite endearing as AJ, the young oil driller who is led by his feelings, and not his brain. Indeed, it is hilarious when Willis says 'you all right kid?', and Affleck answers with 'yeah of course, considering I've never been this scared before in my life, ever.' he has that boyish appeal, and here is when he really did look like he had a good career ahead of him. Nowadays of course, its different.The supporting cast are great as well. Steve Buscemi is gifted as a comedian, albeit a slightly weird one, and he has a lot of fun in his role. Although admittedly you do want to slap him when he starts going crazy and firing the machine gun (which after repeated viewings of the film i still haven't worked out where it came from).Keith David is always good value, and he gets the biggest laugh in the film when the astronauts start singing, and he turns to Thornton and says 'so trueman, this is who you found to save the planet.' the subplot involving him and the 'secondary protocol' is unnecessary, but it does have a certain 'this could happen' feel to it. Its easy to see President Bush making the mistake the President in Armageddon made, and trusting his advisor's over NASA, causing the death of the planet. Will Patton is good as Willis' best mate, and Michael Clarke Duncan, Peter Stormare, and William Fichtner are all humorous and lovable characters. The acting by some is slightly weaker than you'd expect, but this is a big dumb summer blockbuster and Oscar winning acting is never going to be likely.The effects, backed up by the huge budget, are astounding, and standout sequences are the opening destruction raining down on New York and the shuttles take off. The meteors are well realised, and the asteroid looks incredibly menacing in evil, surrounded by green/blue gases and chunks of wicked looking rock.A brilliant soundtrack, coupled to Trevor Rabins haunting and melancholic score gives the movie energy and emotion when required. Indeed, in the beautifully written sequence where Willis says goodbye to daughter grace is superbly done, with the great acting coupled with Trevor Rabin working his magic to draw every extra ounce of love and sadness from the scene.You can easily say the film has problems, not least in Michael Bays inability to keep his camera from moving in six directions at once, and the need to keep every shot down to less than a second in length. But this is a summer film, so sharp editing is required to keep the action sequences going at a lightning fast pace.Overall, this is great film. And if you don't shed a tear when Willis blows himself up with the asteroid, or when Patton is reunited with his son, you aren't alive.Essential viewing!",Armageddon

It's mix of heroism, humor, romance and action is well-blended and all this clashes at the end. The movie has its flaws, unbelievable premise and some characters, but the real goal set by director Michael Bay and creator Jerry Bruckheimer is definitely been scored. That other movie with a similar story, DEEP IMPACT was noted for its good substance and tense moments with the citizens of the world involved. That was a disaster movie, but ARMAGEDDON doesn't worry about the meteor hurtling towards earth but the action and thrills it takes to take it out.NOTE: This spectacular film has the most inspirational and tearjerking moment since GHOST and GLORY.",Armageddon

People wouldn't care about critics and the unbelievable special effects then, and would care to be entertained. But this film was released in 1998, just over a year before the 2000th year after Christ. This film delivers what it's supposed to deliver: an effects-filled, 2-D character driven, entertaining action picture, and I can't imagine it any better at all. It would be blasted for its try-hard attitude if it decided to be more clever and try to put more research into the NASA part of the storyline. That ridiculous film ""Deep Impact"" put substance-over-style, and failed miserably in entertaining anyone. That film got better reviews than ""Armageddon"", but disappointed most viewers because of the dark, seriousness about the film. I don't wanna give the ending away, but any action film would be better off to have just a few heroes die than have the whole damn astronaut crew sacrifice their lives. Plus, no other action-packed film had a more powerful moment at the end of this blockbuster film (except probably John Woo's classic gangster pic ""A Better Tomorrow"").",Armageddon

After about ten minutes of horrible acting non stop destruction and a script with so many plot holes in it you would think it's swiss cheese you would wish that you were dead.  It starts off with Bruce and all his other red neck friends drilling for oil in what looks like the Atlantic.  Here we get to see Bruce running around with a shotgun (very dangerous) and a small explosion that had no purpose but to stop people from falling asleep.  Then Bruce and his friends get picked by the U.S. government to fly two space ships to the asteroid and blow it up.  In the movie each man gets ten days of training and half of them can't even read, and it still gets worse then this.

398,Mac-40,"When your ears stop ringing, listen up.",10,23 October 1998,"It gets pretty sad when a movie is bad-mouthed because it has bad acting. Don't get me wrong, I hate bad actors, and if you've read my other reviews, you'll see that I talk a lot about crappy actors.  But those are for movies where good acting is required for the situation to be believable. 'Armageddon' is a movie that does not require good acting.  Michael Bay never said that the movie would have Academy Award winning acting in the movie.  He said it would be an action packed thrill ride.And it was.  The movie was very good, because it kept the action going straight to the end.  It didn't matter if the acting sucked.  But I have to be accurate about this movie:  The acting was half-decent.  I mean, whenever I see bad acting, I almost always laugh.  I never once laughed during this movie, except when the script required me to.  The acting is pretty good. Bruce Willis is not my favourite actor, after all, some of his movies have shown his 'bad actor' side.  But he does a decent job in this movie along with the rest of the cast.And finally, I will say this.  The last 10 minutes of the movie disturb me. They are horrifyingly sad!!  The last 10 minutes of 'Titanic', were nothing compared to this.  I swear, I almost cried!!  It was so depressing, I was tight-lipped for the first few minutes after I left the theatre.  That's amazing.  A movie starring Bruce Willis is sadder than 'Titanic'.Although I should tell you:  I'm speaking hypothetically.  I didn't find 'Titanic' sad.  In fact I laughed!  But I know many people cried their eyes out in that movie.  So if I didn't find 'Titanic' sad, and millions of other people did, and then I found 'Armageddon' sad, what does that tell you? That 'Armageddon' is one hell of a sad movie.So if you're one of those 'Go see an action flick, just 'cause it's an action flick' kind of guys, go see this movie.  If you enjoy good acting, decent story and stuff like that, go see this movie.  If you want to cry your eyes out at the end, go see this movie.  I do, however recommend you bring ear plugs for some scenes.  (It gets a little loud!)",Armageddon

Does NASA send a group of highly trained astronauts to save the earth from destruction? No. instead they call on Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) and his gang of oil drilling misfits. This happy gang are rounded up from a strip club, casino and various other hideouts, to save the world.This makes from a many laughs and eventually a ""happy ending"". If you want a serious film about saving the planet, don't watch this. Its way to far fetched, and has far too many funny moments to be taken seriously. This is great entertainment. For example when the mad Russian astronaut hits the space shuttles engine with a spanner to get it started! Hilarious. Steve Buscemi's character provides some of the films funniest moments.

By today's standards, yes, as pointed out by many reviewers, it's a patently ""rah rah USA!"" and that's Hollywood for ya!
Why I give this film a poor rating is the bad script, lazy Hollywood clichés, gigantic plot holes and most importantly, the profoundly oblivious attention to anything remotely plausible respecting science.

This movie was never meant to be the end-all scientific question/debate/answer on the subject of asteroids.  I find it interesting that many of the people who complain about the movie either find fault in nonexistent problems (cups of coffee falling in space - that was back at NASA!) or they assume things they know nothing about.  The solar system is a big place, and asteroids four times the size of Texas are found at regular intervals much less ""just"" the size of Texas.   It's true, this movie jumps around a lot.  But they have a lot of story to cover.  And, i'll say this for the movie, unlike Deep Impact - which is just as cheesy, this movie does keep your attention riveted.  From it's comedy to it's music, to the shifting scenes, to the actors themselves, everything happens right after another.    This movie fulfills in some part a fantasy of many people.  Being called to save the world because they know something other people don't.  Sorry to ruin your theories guys, but NASA astronauts don't know everything.  Often they are trained and trained and trained on specific tasks for years - just to eliminate mistakes.  When you've only got eighteen days to train someone to do something important, you want to pick someone who's good enough to handle unforeseen problems that might arise.  Drilling a hole in space isn't like rock collecting, it's something that requires skill and practice.    Some science critics apparently haven't watched the movie before they complained about it.  The moon is far more than a thirty minute trip. Truman tells the astronauts good morning.  That means a day has gone by. Gravity, even if it is far less, still works in space.  ""Heavy"" - i.e. massive objects will still ""fall"".  I admit the sounds was extraneous, but who complains about sound in Star Wars?  And for people who argue that NASA would never run a mission like this, think about it.  How many times has NASA had to identify, plan, and execute a mission in 18 days?  How many times has the Earth truly been in danger of existence-threatening events?    My only complaint was the scope of the movie.  It tried to do too much while still keeping it exciting to the average viewer.  As a result, scenes are cut until they're only on a shot for a few seconds and then the camera is off to the next scene.  It's hard to believe how much they actually do in such a short time, but its effect is measurable.  This movie just keeps on going.",Armageddon
417,AdderCowley,OK apart from Affleck,6,11 April 2007,"To be honest I don't feel Armageddon is a bad film. I found it entertaining and a decent way to spend an evening when nothing else was worth seeing. However there were quite a few things that annoyed me intensely.Firstly the ridiculous romance between Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck. She could have chosen any other character. Steve Owen for example who is even the right age for tyler as you hear Bruce Willis commenting that Owen's character was ""like 5 minutes older than her"" Affleck is simply awful. By far and away the best character is surprise surprise Steve Buscemi, who delivered a great performance compared to the young lovers dribbling over each other using animal crackers as metaphors to the serengetti.The second most annoying thing about this film is that I found the constant America F*** yeah style theme completely destroyed any story that this picture had. You just can't take it seriously when the American boy ran, with the American flag on his shirt to the American astronauts. Also all other forms of life other than America seemed completely obsolete in this film. Every country (especially the middle-eastern countries) always seemed to be in shadow. While every American setting was a slow-mo of some US kids running towards somewhere. Damn it was annoying!!!. Also the fact that the Russian cosmonaut seemed permanently stoned and the British genius is thwarted mentally by Bruce Willis when discussing the drill design. WTF?Also most of the characters seemed to change or disappear! For example when the company of misfits have been told the outcome of the Earth, one character appears and then you don't see him again EVER! He is only mentioned once when Affleck is shouting hysterically at the Russian saying Two of his friends are know dead. I seem to only remember Steve Owen's lifeless corpse. One, not two.Anyway back to character development. The characters which seem to change the most are Willis who goes from hard-core driller to sentimental Christian mentioning god every few lines. And Liv Tyler who changes from head strong rebellious 20 year old to weak minded soppy child by the end of the film. The only character that doesn't change (apart form the cosmonaut, but let's face it there hardly going to concentrate on him) is Affleck who is constantly screaming out ridiculous lines such as ""Harry I love you"". Not great.To the positives, most of the characters were likable. Bear, Steve Owen and the guy who plays chick are decent characters. Also Steve Buscemi and the Russian were probably the best in my opinion. However this brings back the Affleck situation, and this is where the film falls. Nobody can like Affleck's character. Telling Bruce Willis to chill when Bruce is chasing him on the oil rig just makes himself looking pretty stupid. Also the relationship with Tyler, the I love you Brucey scene and an poor overall performance are strong reasons to say that Affleck was pretty bad I'm afraid.Liked most of the characters, OK story, decent no-brain Saturday night film but several serious flaws makes Armageddon an average film.",Armageddon
418,Uberhamster,anything else!,1,19 May 2004,"Suitable for all. No intelligence required. In fact, intelligence in a viewer is a major drawback when watching. An intelligent viewer is not going to like this piece of shall I say: film? It hardly deserves the name. This is in other words a waste of time and money. It is also not ridiculous enough to have a comic force. Intended humor also doesn't deliver.Why so negative? It is packed with clichés, such as a sacrifice and subsequent countdown scene, which makes no sense at all. It has no depth. No motivation, characters just continue carrying out clichés without any real storyline whatsoever. There simply isn't anything good about it. Possible exception allowed for the score.

Sure this movie had plenty of cliches and a totally unbelievable plot but who cares? I read one so called critic from Sweden on how it was another U.S. cowboy saves the day hero movie or close to it. I happen to like heros willing to sacrifice themselves for a higher cause but then I never really hear about heros from Sweden, France or most European countries. England is a huge exception! I would think that Europeans would be thrilled with American Courage but they obviously have short memories of the sacrifice many American heros made to keep all of them from speaking German.

423,Dark Scribe,Jaw dropping spectacle,8,8 January 2000,"Armageddon without doubt is one of the most visually stunning films of recent times, but what made this film great was the different genres it incorporated. Obviously action was the most prevalent, but it had some hilarious comic touches (Steve Buscemi providing most), decent dramatics and the farewell at the end almost brought tears to my eyes. The cast was superb, good lead performances by Messers Willis, Affleck, Patton and the gorgeous Liv Tyler were well complemented by Buscemi and the rest of the shuttle crew, with special mention for Billy Bob Thornton for his outstanding performance. The American supremacy element was very present, numerous shots of the Stars and Stripes got a bit much toward the end, but that was easy to overlook in the face of its sheer quality. The score was very well done, adding much to the dramatics of the film, great music throughout. The final tearful farewell was especially special for me, as I fully expected it but was still moved, a tribute to Willis and Liv Tyler and their skill in carrying off this oft used scene. All in all, Armageddon was all I expected and more, an excellent film and one that shines far above Deep Impact and most other action films in general. I tip my hat to Jerry Bruckheimer, another brilliant effort from him, may his brilliant streak continue. 8 out of 10.",Armageddon
424,Martin-242,Horrible movie,3,30 June 2000,"I thought Armageddon was a horrible and stupid movie. The characters in the movie were making jokes and they also demanded things and if they didn't get it they wouldn't save the world. I don't think anyone would make jokes or demands when the world is about to end. It also had bad acting especially Ben affelcts, and Bruce Willis's performances were the worst, both of them were nominated for their acting in the Razzie awards( which honor the worst in movies). The Only person who tried to give a good performance was Liv Tyler. In fact I didn't really see the whole movie it bored me half way Through. This movie also received the worst reviews by the most famous critics in the U.S.A.",Armageddon

426,Danielramos16,The most overwhelming movie ever made,4,25 July 2008,"Armageddon is pure entertainment, and it's meant to be fun. On the other hand it's a film that tries way too hard. It's an action, adventure, Sci-Fi, Comedy, Drama, Romance, and Disaster movie all mixed into one! Then throw in a gigantic budget, an all-star cast, dazzling special effects, explosions, a cheesy love story, over the top humor, and lots of music. Add that all together and we have the most overwhelming movie ever made. The viewer is just bombarded with this barrage of special effects, music, cheap jokes, and romance, I felt my brain was overloading. If your looking for pure Fun & entertainment then you'll probably love this film. Of course you have to be prepared to suspend disbelief in order to enjoy this movie and ignore the obvious flaws. 1.) First off there is an asteroid the size of Texas hurtling towards Earth. In reality the largest asteroid ever discovered was about the size of a small city, there isn't an asteroid of such freakish size anywhere near our solar system.2.) NASA only becomes aware of the asteroid after a meteor shower and when they do discover it they only have 18 days before it hits Earth. In reality we would have a few years warning that an asteroid of such size was coming that close to us. NASA telescopes are very powerful and can see beyond our solar system, so they would have to be blind to miss it. We'd have plenty of warning.3.) being that we'd have plenty of warning we'd also have plenty of time to prepare. So the whole story of Armageddon is now out of the question. NASA would train a rag tag group of undisciplined oil drillers to go into space in a few days on this mission to drill a hole into the asteroid and blow it up with a nuke cause the astronauts know nothing about drilling. In reality they would most likely have the drillers train their astronauts in drilling for months maybe even a year for this kinda mission. The oil drillers would never have been prepared for the rigors of space travel in such a short period of time.4.) Asteroids are usually more rounded, not funky looking like the asteroid in this film. The Comet in Deep Impact was more accurate to the shape and look of asteroids & comets.5.) NASA doesn't have cool advanced looking shuttles that fly like fighter aircraft like the ones in this movie. It would take months for them to make such a ship. And they wouldn't be that stupid in installing gatling guns on the armadillos in the event Steve Buschemi goes nuts.6.) In the movie the team Drill a hole 800 feet deep to plant a nuclear warhead in the center which would split the asteroid in two and divert them in opposite directions, both of which would miss the planet. In reality if the asteroid was that big they would need to drill the hole about a hundred miles into the damn thing, and it would take more than one Nuke to do the job. The asteroid would also not split in half and miss the planet, It would most likely fragment into a few pieces and probably still hit. At 800 feet it would probably just make a big crater.... at best!7.) The team swing shots around the moon at 11 G's in order to get behind the asteroid. In reality at 11 G's they would either pass out or die. 8.) Asteroids don't have gravitational fields. 9.) biblical inaccuracies: in the bible Armageddon is described as the epic battle on Earth between the forces of good & evil. So is the asteroid embodying evil or something, it's just a freaking rock.Is it just me or is there is always something going wrong in this film. Atlantis destroyed, Meteor showers, cities destroyed, team members clash & bicker, The Russian space station explodes, they land on the hardest part of the rock, the military panics and tries to blow the nuke up from Earth, then the Nuke won't explode so someone has to stay behind to blow it up. Nobody likes constant drama in their lives why would we want it in this movie. It also tries too many times to be funny at the most unexpected and unnatural times.How can Liv Tyler's character fall for Ben Affleck's character? Affleck plays someone who's so annoying, so whinny, and immature. No wonder Bruce Willis doesn't want them getting married. That scene where Affleck & Tyler are having a picnic and he plays animal cracker safari on her belly was the most retarded thing I ever saw, in fact it was kinda weird. In fact many of the characters were over the top & dramatic.For all it's fun Armageddon simply lacks any intelligence. It's all brawn and no brain. Like I said if you looking for just entertainment you'll enjoy this film, if you like your films to be somewhat intelligent then you might want to save your money. Try not to take Armageddon seriously.",Armageddon
427,Shinzons,The Mother of all Blockbusters,8,7 December 2008,"Armageddon is quite simply the mother of all blockbusters. It is exciting, entertaining, funny, powerful.

There are some scenes in the film, many at the end were we see the world rejoicing, those are really corny, and the film would be twice as good without them. But this is the mother of all blockbusters, and i doubt that there will be a blockbuster like it ever again. I mean that in a very good way. And i also love it's diverse soundtrack.

428,thatheo,"starts off great, all downhill from there",6,23 March 2008,"Armageddon is your typical Michael Bay movie: Loud, Stupid, shallow, but ultimately very watchable, humorous and spectacular too.When I started watching this movie, I was not disappointed. The introduction on the oil platform was very funny, and Bruce Willis hitting golf balls into a Greenpeace boat was something that made men laugh loudly. The roles were played well, and it was all amusing. The fun lasted, and lasted, right until the moment that the president gave a speech about how America is going to save the world etc, etc, and the all the drilling idiots got onto the rocket.It all went downhill from there. The silly but fun humor was replaced with gung-ho patriotism, the action scenes were stupid and the events became so far-fetched that not even the most beautifully filmed explosions couldsave the movie from drowning in epic retardation. A sad case because the movie started off quite alright, but ended up being a complete train-wreck.I still give it a six because I found it entertaining, but very shallow and silly and with a poor second half. The special effects, the soundtrack and the way it was filmed (Bay's frenetic, constantly moving camera has been appealing since it worked so great in the Rock, and it has never lost its charm since if you ask me) made up a great deal to me (plus, the first 60% of the movie WAS entertaining, so a 6 is to me quite an adequate grade).",Armageddon

It was a waste of three and a half hours of my time that could've been spent on something better, like writing a better movie.  Also, the Areosmith song was WAY overplayer.  Over all... it was icky.  I voted it a three... thinking back, it would've been a two if not for Steve Buscemi.",Armageddon
430,cbvb,The worst movie I've ever seen in the theater,1,27 September 2000,"I could compare this movie to a dozen badly made (though surely more cheaply made) sci-fi flicks (Meteor comes to mind), but the real comparison that I arrived at was to the crappy full motion video games that came out in the early 90's. You know the ones where you would bop the joystick right, then left, and maybe hit the action button? The whole movie proceeds in a series of sequences like this, except for a few treacly touchy feely scenes where the movie grinds to an utter halt. At least my ear drums had a chance to heal.About halfway through the movie, the characters board a space shuttle to go in the space. At this point in the theater, I literally turned to my wife and said, ""Well, maybe it will get better from here."" No such luck. I will confess to being a science weenie, and it bugs me somewhat when sci-fi flicks play fast an loose with the facts. Nevertheless, effective storytelling gets me past that. Armageddon is an insult to the American movie-goer, almost as if some foreign movie company had typed up a script, saying all along ""Who cares if we show grass on the asteroid (no joke)? Those stupid Americans won't know the difference!"" Then the evil multinational corporation would run screen tests that would tell them they need more explosions and less dialog. Now that I think about it, I think a movie about the making of Armageddon would have made a better movie.Listen, some bad movies are still fun, like Highlander, or Remo Williams...this movie has no joy in its heart. It is coldly cynical and corporate and dead. Please don't support it by renting it. If you're looking for a space disaster flick, rent any of the Alien films, or Deep Impact, or even the fairly lousy Event Horizon.

When they take of to the big rock it gets verry fake. There's to much heroic stuff going on (especially by Bruce who gives his life to the sun-in-law he hates).

The plot about space shuttles being sent to space to blow up and asteroid is ridiculous (the idea being that it is easier to teach oil drillers to be astronauts than it is to teach astronauts to drill a hole), and the romantic sub-plot including Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler frankly nauseating.At a pinch, the performances of Billy Bob Thornton and Steve Buscemi aren't bad, and a sub-plot involving a divorced father and his estranged child has a smidgen of emotional resonance, but overall, its your classic Jerry Bruckheimer pic, and you should know what you're getting when you play your video rental fee.",Armageddon
435,frog663,Give it a chance.,8,6 November 2003,"Armageddon is neither the best, nor worst, movie ever made.  Reading some of the previous comments here, it is apparent that some people may have forgotten the whole concept of what a movie is supposed to provide; namely, entertainment.  While some films, admittedly, are based in fact, Armageddon is A FANTASY.  How is anyone going to be able to make a film about (Spoilers ahead:) the potential end of the world and do so accurately?  This film isn't supposed to be a training manual for how to save the world, merely an entertaining ""what if?"".Yes, the idea of the government calling on Bruce Willis to drill into the center of an asteroid heading for Earth is preposterous.  So what?  It's not as if there would be any reason for anyone at the Pentagon to have given any serious thought to this particular chain of events happening beforehand, is there?  Even Billy Bob Thornton (who was surprisingly understated in his role) admitted to Willis that there was no back-up plan.  If they had a better idea, they would've used it, don't you think?Had Willis and his crew played this completely straight, the entertainment value would've been nil.  Armageddon was basically about a bunch of, essentially, misfits banding together to save mankind.  Any flaws in logic in the script, to me, were most welcome.  If I wanted to watch a documentary, I would've tuned into PBS.  This was a good old-fashioned rah rah kind of escapist film.  Willis was nothing like his typical wise guy character;  choosing, instead, to create a flawed man who was devoted to his job, as well as his daughter.  There were enough special effects to keep even the most jaded viewer happy.The bottom line?  Armageddon is exactly what you would expect a movie about saving the world to be like.

Best example: You don't care WHO gets to manually detonate the bomb at the end. You only care THAT the bomb is detonated so that the mission succeeds. This emotional bondage is greatly created by a very thoughtful use of slow-motion and an intensely gripping musical score.) And you feel a great satisfaction that it DID succeed, a feeling that touches your conscience so greatly that you feel deeply emotionally involved with the protagonists. I have to admit that the feeling is so intense that the final scenes brought tears to my eyes. Next to ""Armageddon"", only ""Titanic"" has ever succeeded in doing so.I also have to disagree with quagga about the ""Hail to the US""-thing of this movie. I know a lot of End-of-the-world-movies who exceed the US-patriotism, like ""Independence Day"".So, this movie has many flaws, sure, but it touches even the intellectual (!) viewer on a level that he surely did not expect.

An overly sentimental flick with a ridiculous number of stupid and pointless explosions. I mean, how many explosions does one REALLY want to see? Yes, the humor was good, Buscemi ruled (always), but I was SO fed up with this movie. I honestly was very glad it was over. It also features one of the lamest love stories ever. There was NO chemistry between Tyler and Affleck. Neither was there between Willis and Tyler. This movie lacked any emotion while going way overboard on the gushy mushy side. And the special effects weren't even all that impressive. Not to mention that the story didn't make any sense. I also hated the amount of nationalistic element, the whole ""America is the best country in the world""-attitude.

But the problem solving team of grunts continually manage to solve each problem and encounter the new one every five to ten minutes. The action scenes were poor, I had no idea what was going on most of the time.

(they clearly point out the existance of these canyons in at least one scene in the movie)...The filmmakers make such a big scene of the apparent thinking that goes on by scientists etc; hence I feel obliged to go out of my way to express the incredible lack of thinking that actually goes on...There is a great scene when they are interviewing the various crew members in training, but this, and the some reasonable acting and one-liners by the cast, are the only redeeming qualities of this highly overrated movie...There are other unrealistic elements associated with this movie (the amazing maneuverability of the space shuttles for instance) but I don't want to appear totally negative...[3/10]",Armageddon

Sometimes I think that the camera man just thinks ""F*** you, this angle is too boring! I'm gonna look at something else."" And it looks like he thinks it in almost every scene! The result: the camera keeps going around and around like a crazy b*** and quickly gives you a headache!Another one is that the cast looks like a list of bad actors that doesn't ""fit"" with the movie's story at all! Bruce Willis making dramatic moments p***es me off and that whatsthat Liv Tyler is a lesson of how not to act.Also, the story is very, very ridiculous! Well... I'm sure that the whole world wouldn't take the solutions that it took when trying to save the world. C'mon! We're talking about saving our planet Earth, so sending sonovab***es like they did in the movie surely isn't a good idea!Well... any other thing I haven't mentioned yet? Oh, yeah! Next time, NASA, try not to make propaganda telling us that the world is gonna blow up with an asteroid 30 years from now, OK? It wasn't funny.",Armageddon

I have never seen a film that insults the viewer's intelligence like this movie did example: Toward's the end of the movie when they have to decide who stays behind they draw straws!! I mean come on!! drawing straws in outer space?!?. Another example: when they can't get the engine fixed they pick up a wrench and hit the engine with it and it starts!!

Oh, it is? Okay. The science fiction part of this left a lot to be desired. Being the closet geek that I am, I have to honestly say, I was completely disappointed with the science fiction part of it. The technical details, the reasons they wanted THIS man instead of someone trained for space duties... I just find that my suspension of disbelief fails me here, and I simply found myself saying, ""Yeah, right."" However, that being said, the humor of the story is great. It's subtle, not in your face, and Willis, as always, has some excellent sarcastic zingers done in such a subtle way, that the laughter just sneaks up on you. Comedy is a nice twist for him. In the end, I honestly have to say that I was not expecting what happened. I figured, ""Oh, this is going to be sad, the kid is going to die, and Willis's character will learn a lesson, and him and his daughter will be so close...blah blah blah - blech!"" When that WASN'T what happened, I must honestly say, I was both pleasantly surprised, and I cried. Yes, me, the woman who very rarely ever cries at any movie, cried at the way this one ended. When he called him his son, I just lost it. So while the science fiction part of it left something to be desired, the sub plot here, or in some people's minds, the actual plot, really makes this movie a tear jerker worth watching.",Armageddon

453,madmaxmedia,My Ultimate Guilty Pleasure- how do you assign a rating to that?,8,24 April 2006,"This movie is my ultimate guilty pleasure. It's inane, manipulative, has hyperactive cutting, a ton of glaring inaccuracies (pointless to even discuss or debate), and probably 29 other glaring faults. And why in every dramatic slow-mo emo shot are there 3 helicopters flying in unison overhead? What's the point of having 3 helicopters flying really close together? Who cares! It looks cool. If one day I am having a heartfelt talk with my daughter, I hope there are 3 helicopters flying overhead to really 'bring it home' (and Aerosmith performing in the background.)Despite it all, I still love watching this movie. Anytime it is on TV I can watch it 'til the end. Bruce Willis does a great job doing his Bruce Willis 'thing' (smart alecky tough guy), and the supporting cast is really great. Steve Buschemi in particular gets the best lines. An awesome assortment of ragtag castoffs (spitting funny one-liners) must save the world- who would have thunk it?I think Armageddon was actually conceived by suits in a studio office (no really, I read that in a magazine), which is I guess another strike against it. Yet only a bunch of suits could come up with a 'high concept' like this (so high it's basically a parody by itself.) And only a director like Michael Bay could make it. He's far more suited to these types of movies, rather than big historical epics like PEARL HARBOR (which I really, really disliked.)I read somewhere once that this movie is as close as Hollywood gets to pure cinema, in that it is basically completely divorced from reality of any kind. Is that good or bad? I don't know. I do think if you're going to ditch convention and any semblance to reality, you may as well go all the way. It's better than having something that is a confused mess that tries to be different things (Pearl Harbor.) There will be no 'it could really happen!' here.So after all this, believe it or not I am going to give this movie a big fat whopping 8. Why? Because IMO it unabashedly succeeds at what it tries to set out to be, whatever that is. That makes no sense, since I am basically saying by all logical accounts this movie may actually suck, yet I am giving it a 8. But hey I loved this movie.",Armageddon

They held back on his trademark white singlet smeared with sweat, grime and tomato sauce this time round. Bruce never plays a high IQ dood, so, like the rest of the grunge blue collar group he leads, would never have made any astronaut team, but what the heck, it's only another gross Bruckheimer extravaganza, why not sit back, relax and enjoy? Because it's so phony, is why. The dialog is corny, the plot oh-so-predictable, the name players acting by numbers as if they were on remote or auto pilot. Surprised to see Ben Affleck there, he can act a bit, even if he looks the same as Matt Damon and Ken Wahl; he must have needed the money. I wonder if ordinary Americans have any idea how much this category of Hollywood slop impacts on America's reputation abroad. It leaves a dent the size of Texas, know what I mean?

Bruce Willis's character was just the right one. It seems like his character was made just for him. Then, who doesn't like ben affleck? his part was good and i think he did a great acting job. Grace's part was played very well also. There were hardly any poor acting jobs in this movie. And, even forgetting all the acting, the movie was great.

456,Flaviaj1991,The most underrated movie of all time,10,29 April 2020,"This glorious movie has everything you can expect to enjoy: action, drama, comedy, romance, epic outbursts, emotional moments, great special effects that have aged almost nothing and a good soundtrack. I like movies that even with a serious premisse, don't take itselves too seriously, having scenes that allow us to smile and laugh a little. This is Armageddon. No, this isn't philosophical or the most deeper and realist plot, cause this is not the prupose.Bruce Willis is Harry Stamper, the father that every daughter in the earth wants and would be proud to have: a flawed but deeply heroic guy, tough on the outside with a soft heart on the inside, willing to die to save not only his daughter but all humanity. Liv Tyler lives Grace, at the height of her beauty, that even not participating in the action still brings us emotional moments with the interaction between her dad and her boyfriend. Ben Affleck is decent in the role of A.J., incarnating the typical reckless hero guy who is in love with the beautiful girl and that ries to win the trust of his jealous father-in-law, who at heart loves him and is like a father to him too.Is it cliché? Yeah. But it's a cliché that manages to entertain me for almost 3 hours and still manages to pull tears at the end. The scene of Harry switching places with AJ and giving his final speech to Grace always makes me cry and if that part doesn't bring you any emotional reaction, you not have a soul or a heart... And I can't finish without to say the supporting cast is great too, especially Steve Buscemi, who is perfect on paper comic relief role.",Armageddon

With a ""yeah, right"" factor as high as Armageddon, I'm left wondering what sort of judge of movies my friends are, or much of the general public for that matter going by the number of people giving this movie a 10. I was not bowled over by Deep Impact, but at least it was more than mere eye candy. The most troubling part of Armageddon for me was the attitude of the drillers in preparing for the mission.

In a way, I see it as hailing  in a new era of filmmaking, one where the anticipated, sought after, big budget films of the summer are reduced to script-by-committee, special effects laden, bore fests.  Sure, there have been such movies prior to this debacle but this ridiculous gross of this idiot movie would seem to indicate that this style of film is here to stay, whether we want it or not.We all know the premise of the film already:  Bruce Willis, deep core driller and the most unlikeable main character to grace the screen in a long time, is asked by the government to help destroy world threatening asteroid.To tag along for the ride is Ben Affeck, generally a favorite of mine, whose romantic leading man character is so schmarmy as to give the strongest amongst us stomach palpatations.  Scenes between he and Liv Tyler (in yet another typically Hollywood throwaway cheesecake female role) made me yearn for a handy airline barfbag.  Romance is well and good but these scenes were painful, as if director Michael Bay learned everything he knows about romance from Hallmark commercials.  Bleh...To top things off, the movie is unbearably long clocking in around 2 1/2 hours!!!Avoid this movie like the plague or, if you want to see the future of big budget summer stupid fests, look no further.

It seemed to almost be a spoof on the genre, but Lesley Nielson never popped up in any of the scenes, so I assume it wasn't meant to be that.

This is one of those films that Hollywood make for the American audience. They think they are stupid and they will watch any film full of stars and action, explosions and the like. Hollywood don't like their audience to think, and this film in the first twenty minutes proves it. The earth will be demolished in 18 days ( so far so good ), so NASA get Bruce Willis, ( best driller in the world ) to come and help. So, they come and pick up Willis and his daughter, ( played by Liv ) off a drilling platform in the ocean and take them to NASA headquarters. Willis comments on the fact that in 18 hours they have been apologizing to him for the inconvenience. So, lets say it took a couple of days to explain to them the situation, why oh why did the rest of the crew leave the platform?? And how the hell did the role of Ben Affleck, in a couple of days set up his own company and started drilling? If you also notice he has a board with his name printed, and its RUSTY for crying out loud, in a couple of days. Where was he drilling, under acid rain. This is only the start and it was enough for me. I didn't enjoy the film at all.

463,formala44,"5 words: terrible, bad, idiotic, predictable, garbage",1,26 October 2008,"Warning; this comment may contain spoilers.I wonder why they chose the name Armageddon. They would do this movie more justice by calling it 'The movie where Ben Afleck does a lot of dangerous stuff, survives them and then gets married'. Its also way too predictable and has laughable plot twistings that make you wanna laugh or yawn. Or both. The story is about a big asteroid thats about to crash into the earth and end all life. Willis and Affleck and pals are tasked with saving the earth by blowing it up. Will they be able to manage it? Usually a movie does its best to provide reasonable and believable quests but Armageddon has more seemingly unsurpassable problems than all the Indiana Jones movies together. An asteroid needs to be blown up by oil drillers turned astronauts. Will they be able to make it? A bomb is about to go off with the timer counting down. Will they be able to dismantle it in time? A shuttle crashes into the asteroid, will Ben Affleck survive? The asteroid surface is very hard. Will they be able to drill a hole in it? The space station has a fuel leak and the crew needs to escape. Will they be able to make it? Whilst drilling into the surface a rain of meteorites slams in. Will they be able to survive? Etc, etc, etc, etc. The sheer number of problems makes this story very hard to believe and the endless shouting and mayhem becomes simply irritating.Then there's the background music. Which is without any fantasy and youl probably could imagine what the scenes where like by just listening to it. dramatic when Afleck and Tyler say goodbye before his voyage. Heroic when he comes back and she flies into his arms. Suspencefull when they have to fight yet another problem. So very predictable.Then there's the directing and editing. I cant believe anyone thinks highly of Michael Bay. The editing was so fast that at times you simply had no clue what was happening and why. The depiction of a flattened Paris uninspired and not very believable. The carnage in New York too much and grossly overdone not to mention way too long. The movie lacks pace in some parts and has too much in others. This is an important aspect for a director and if he cant understand this the movie is doomed, which it is.Then there's the acting. The dialogs between Affleck and Willis where awful. The action unconvincing. Affleck does his best to look bored and has a flat display. Willis was not much better. Liv Tyler was not bad but played the - obligatory in these kind of movies - love interest of Affleck with the only purpose in her life twiddling the engagement ring between her fingers. Owen Wilson was like a child so bad. The only actor who got to his usual standards was Buscemi but granted, the dialogs where simply terrible for everybody.I've seen some bad movies in my life, notably the Seagal or Van Damme movies, but this one really tops everything I've ever came across. After about 10 minutes of watching i predicted the end would be Tyler jumping in Afflecks arms under cheers from onlookers with a hugely heroic music back ground. And duly that happened. Not one moment was a surprise. It wasn't entertaining at all. A black spot on the careers of great actors like Willis and Buscemi.

I hadn't felt that queasy since having sat through the Blair Witch Project with its incessant camera shaking. I laughed but not all the way to the bank as this sorry cast did. Fact is, this movie actually made me mad when I left the theatre. What a sorry, sorry mess. Yes, I was laughing mad. I would classify this as the best comedy ever and the worst serious movie ever and right on par with another very expensive worthless flick, the Wild Wild West. What absolutely amazes me is the amount of money this stupid travesty brought in.

Well, that's not enough reason for society to be so negative about it. Wars, diseases, murders, they're all around us. Death is a natural, normal thing. Why would you oppose someone trying to take their own life? Isn't it HIS life? What do YOU have to do with it? I say that because I just watched this ""movie"". For fear I might put those questions of mine into practical use, I'll stop any other references to this...thing. Not for me, but for the ones who love me and depend on me.Perhaps it's religion-influenced cultural convictions. Maybe it's the delicacy and squeamishness of the average person. Maybe another reason. In the end, suicide is not that dramatic or Earth-shattering a disaster as some think it is. By exterminating humans on a constant basis, death is giving life to this planet. Otherwise, there would be no place for a foot and we'd have to look for other planets. It's all part of a grand-scale cycle of life.

Nasa has microwave matter splitters, for heaven's sake.Why do they need a team of oil workers to operate a drill?Why can't a NASA physicist put together a drill designed by an idiot?Why can't a NASA physicist understand how a solar sail works and why would he roll his eyes at the movies most sensible idea?What the hell does getting a ""C"" average in astrophysics have to do with anything??THIS IS cinematic garbage! Watch Deep Impact, you might actually learn a whole lot of neat stuff and the movie is just as exciting as Armageddon, if not more so.",Armageddon
478,Randy-38,"Entertainment, plain and simple.",10,2 August 1998,"I know I'll receive some bad comments for this, but Armageddon is my 2nd favorite movie of all time. Just right behind Aliens. And why is that you ask? Because, for 2 and 1/2 hours, I was entertained. I thought Armageddon was funny, emotional, exciting, and inspirational, all rolled up in one big Texas-sized asteroid. I know the technical and factual errors throughout the film are more numerous than anything. But you know what? I don't care. I still thought it was a great film. Better than Deep Impact, and better than what the summer has had to offer so far. As far as the cliches go.....what movie doesn't have cliches? And now as far as the critics go....had this film been made by Miramax or some independent company, directed by Quentin Tarantino or some foreign guy nobody has heard of, shot for less money than what Titanic is still making every weekend, I'm sure the reviews would have been different.Bottom line, the end of the world has never been more fun.",Armageddon

This is what happens when the writer, director and producer fail to graduate from high school.  This was one of the most absurd films I have seen.  The constant camera movement for the first half of the film was tiresome.  This was an animated comic book for imbeciles.",Armageddon

He said he cried, even though he was a man, because the issues in this one are very human.Well,  my friend, cry as you may, but this is really a stupid flick.  Okay, it's entertaining, especially the ""pre-flight"" part  of the movie - where comic relief is at it's best, I must admit (that JKF line - great!).  But honestly, from there on, the thing is pathetically juvenile.  They tried to make it a comic-strip movie, like Superman, and make us believe in it at the same time.  End result : really dumb.  And the ""emotional charge"" is lame and easy.You know, some movies you go see with a specific mindset : we are perfectly aware that with this kind of movie, you have to put your good-taste button to zero to appreciate it .  Usually, you get out of these with a big smile in your face if you are ready to get in the game.But for Armageddon, unfortunately, there is no number under zero on the dial, so that's just asking for too much on my part.",Armageddon
482,Johnnee-2,What a horrible movie...,1,3 July 1999,"By the time ""Armageddon"" was about halfway through, I was hoping that the asteroid DID strike Earth and wipe out those damned annoying characters in the movie. When it ended, and its supposed tearjerking ending took the life of Bruce Willis, I cheered. I don't mind Willis (""Die Hard"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" are two of my all-time faves), but in this one he was so annoying I wished I could reach in the TV screen and punch him out, just like most of the other characters.""Armageddon"" is a testosterone-overloaded special-effect-laden mess, with a horrible screenplay and bad direction. The soundtrack is ok (I'm a big Aerosmith fan), and there were 2 characters who I didn't feel like shooting (Billy Bob Thornton and Liv Tyler's characters were close to normal).Also - I'm Canadian, and I hate these huge American movies (a la ""Independence Day"") that seem to tell the world, ""Without America, you'd all be toast!"" - and throw American flags in our faces while blowing up everything in sight.The thing that gets me is... Thornton won an Oscar in 1996 for writing the screenplay to ""Sling Blade"". Co-star Ben Affleck won an Oscar in 1997 for co-writing ""Good Will Hunting"".

Layer overblown music on top of that and have everyone yelling at everyone else, everyone acting full blast. Add in a some overblown emotional scenes that are there as some attempt to fill in the story. Billy Bob is about the only guy who somehow remains slightly above the hackneyed level of the script.

485,movieexpert2001,michael bay's movies are the reason cinema was invented,10,22 June 2020,"I heard Alot of news of how so many people adore this film to death it amused them to death and so i decided to watch and wow this is one of the greatest movies i have ever seen it is about how a large asteroid can hit earth again and cause extinction the film was directed by Michael bay the man behind alot of cinemetic experiences he has not made a single Cinemetic train wreck his entire career i pretty much adore almost all of his movies and this one is as far as i am concerned his best movie he has made in his whole career while i originally thought that the rock was his best film which most detractors say, this film in my opinion is his best especially because Michael bay and his movies are the real reason cinema was invented and this movie proves it. the film has a great cast which is bruce willis, liv tyler, ben affleck, william fichtner, Steve Buscemi, michael clark duncan, and many others, this film first opens with meteor showers causing destruction around the planet, and bruce willis plays harry stamper who is an oil driller that has a daughter named grace ( liv tyler ) who is engaged to aj frost ( ben affleck ) who is also harry's best friend and co worker who also does oil drilling others include bear ( michael clark duncan ), rockhound ( steve buscemi ) and oscar,( owen wilson ) and now as i see the film has a great and interesting cast and the actors are well known from other movies and we also know what roles they have been known for like bruce willis who is an action movie star who played in several amazing action movies there is no denying he has played well in them and many say his best movie is either the die hard movies or the sixth sense but this is without doubt his best movie not even sixth sense or die hard can beat this one as his best movie. and it also has owen wilson who ususally plays in alot of fantastic comedy flicks, there is steve buscemi who has been in alot of good movies including some action movies as well as some comedies to he is alo largely known for starring in the crime series boardwalk empire which i thought was really good he has shown very strong performances in there but this is also his best performance, we also have william fichtner who also plays in some legendary action blockbluster films, he played many supporting roles his films include black hawk down, drive angry and the serial drama series prison break, this is also his best performance, there is michael clark duncan who played in the green mile this film and green mile are both his best performances, there is jason issacs who plays his roles very intelligently his most famous roles are in harry potter and the patriot but even so he does good here as a supporting actor. as well as will patton who also plays in action dramas here he also gives a fantastic performance, there is billy bob thornton a very good actor who recieved oscar nominations for a simple plan and sling blade this movie along with them are among his very best performances, and then there is also ben affleck, he was in many good movies including good will hunting, the town, argo, shakesphere in love and also in another michael bay film pearl harbor this film along with them tie to being his best performances , the other actors include peter stormare and ken campbell. this movie is all of the actors best performance, the oil drillers are then hired to go destroy the asteroid and when they arrive they unite with lev andropov ( peter Stormare ) who has a strong Russian accent he speaks the accent very well he is also amazing in this film, also many deaths happen such as the deaths of oscar and max they sacrificed themselves and in the end harry himself sacrifices because at the end one of the oil drillers had to stay for the bomb to destroy the asteroid it ends with a j marrying grace along with showing a Memorian with portraits of harry and the other members of the crew who sacrificed themselves. this film is about showing great courage and bravery and all of the members of the cast did a fantastic job with their character's it has alot of patriotism just like most of bay's films do and here what bay has done is save us all by warning us what to do when a large asteroid is about to hit earth again. i even heard that this movie was a major box office success but however it grossed 553.7 million i think it should have made more money than that like possibly a billion dollars i think it deserved to make a billion at the box office and its no wonder why almost all of bay's movies make a ton of money, its because so many people love it even some critics, moviegoers and detractors do to its just that rumors say not many of them like him and several have not been kind to him well those critics are wrong they need to learn a lesson to enjoy a great popcorn flick and that is what Michael bay's movies are supposed to be enjoyable popcorn flicks thats the genre he makes and movies are all good in different genres and that includes popcorn action they are all among the best movies ever made and this movie proves once again that Michael bay is the best thing about filmmaking and he deserves way to much credit for this, his films deserve the success they get michael bay desrrves the succes and we all must let him have it none of his movies deserve to flop because they dont they all deserve to make billions of dollars as much as possible. at the end of the movie when it was over i was exited and i was deciding which of the performances of the actors was the best of them all. many would say it was bruce willis because he gave his best performance of his entire career and his charachter was very likeable i thought there was two best performances meaning there were two actors who gave the best performance of all and that was both bruce willis and peter Stormare because i liked how stormare was speaking in his Russian accent as well as how he was acting, and with bruce willis i liked him as how he portrayed the oil driller correctly he was the best oil driller of them all he was the hero and he i lovd how he saved the world by sacrificing himself. he was definetly the best part of the film, and as you see while michael bay was directing he also produced the film along with the one and only jerry Bruckheimer who is my favorite movie producer and he did a great job producing it. there can be no better disaster thriller than this armageddon is the best science fiction disaster film of all time as well as being one of the greatest and best movies of all time and that explains how it ended up in the criterion collection. that is because this movie is one of the reasons cinema is invented and its one of the best things that ever happened to the history of cinema, I for one will violently and strongly praise this master of fantastic action movies who is Michael bay and this amazing action producer who is jerry bruckheimer and all you film critics and movie fans should to, bay and bruckheimer deserved an oscar, final grade score A+++",Armageddon

Cool special effects, great soundtrack (Aerosmith, ZZ Top, Journey), and a great story. Oh yeah and an awesome cast (Bruce Willis, Ben Affeleck back when he was a good actor, Billy Bob Thorton, Liv Tyler). What also makes it so good that this isn't like Independence Day where their are aliens and other freaks coming to end the world. THIS COULD HAPPEN. An asteroid could impact Earth. Great song at the end too. Aerosmith's I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing.There are some problems like, it is long. Seriously it is long. Make it two and a half hours long. In the original script, there was another half hour. Three hours of problems. The roughnecks weren't even in space in the first hour. Secondly, please, a little less problems?

However, the cast, the writing, the director and the music are fantastic. I am a huge fan of action movies. This movie is much more than that. It has lines in it that may not have worked as well with another cast. In fact, I think that with another cast, it would been just another cheezy scifi movie. I, truly, cannot think of anything that I would change about this movie. Even the ending was formulaic, but great. It is another good guys vs bad guys movie, except the bad guy is an asteroid.

490,sven_nilsson-1,Nice action movie ruined by a handful of flaws,4,30 July 2006,"I watched this movie about six years ago and I recently did so again. If I remember correctly I did not like it at all the first time and I appreciated it slightly more this second time.This movie is obviously on a big budget. The effects are mostly top notch (except for one or two ""impacts"") and the cast is impressive. However, there are some elements that destroy the overall impression of the show.Firstly, whoever decided that Peter Stormare should act as a crazy Russian astronaut should be fired. Being a Swede and a fan of Peter, I'm pretty sure he can play a Russian character well. But his performance in this case is plain stupid, both with respect the lines uttered and the acting. So... something must be wrong with the script. I'd like to see Peter as a professional Russian astronaut instead.Secondly, the action scenes that take place on the surface are so intense that it is nearly unbearable to watch. It is a total chaos that lasts over thirty minutes with too few moments to catch one's breath. In addition to this, the events that unfold are simply not credible. I'd like to see a much more sensible and stripped down version of this part of the movie.Finally, the scenes that involve flying space shuttles are too action-biased. The shuttles are maneuvering like if they were a couple of MIGs, at zero safety distance, while bouncing off car-sized ice blocks like ping-pong balls. The director should watch Apollo 13 to learn the limitations of spacecraft like these.I like the music score because it is dramatic to a degree making it very touching. The overall performance of the actors is great. Apart from the things mentioned above the story is interesting and quite easy to follow.With some minor changes this would have been a 8/10 movie. I'm sorry it isn't!",Armageddon

Dan is in the bottom level or ground level and  looks at grace( LIEV TYLER) who  is in a balcony level and is feeling sad because of the sacrifice that was payed for all of them to live. She turns away from the balcony in a second and guess who's there to comfort her......... The FLASH a.k.a. Dan.

These movies lack anything time based, particularly plot and continuity.  The images may be rearranged arbitrarily without damaging the meaning of the movie, because there is no meaning.  Armageddon is one of the worst examples of this style of filmmaking.Armageddon contains many impressive images.  However, everything else was sacrificed.  It has a truly awful script.  The plot is unbelievable.  The dialog is pathetic.  The continuity is poor.  The passage of time in the story is highly variable and inconsistent.  The science is particularly bad.

They send half a dozen idiotic, egotistical oil drilling maniacs to save the world.  With NO backup plan, NO creative thinking and NO story.  The only story was of course Liv Tylers and Ben Affleck's little love, but oh kazoo.....While the team is in space they give Liv her own little room with 15 TVs to weep over and man this movie sucked hard.

On 2nd viewing I was surprised to enjoy it a lot more, especially the training sequence I found had good character development and several chuckles which seemed to relieve the depression of the ""End of the world"" premise. I like Mr. Willis better as I see more of his films. Casting Steve Buscemi was a great move. After seeing him play his weasel character a few times, it was nice to see him in a likeable character without losing the ""weasel"" qualities. Nice to see hollywood cast someone without a ""pretty boy"" face in a decent part. The humor and ""macho"" comeraderie added to the overall enjoyment of this film. Nice also to see Billy Bob Thornton in a mainstream pic, I am beginning to appreciate his acting more. Six of the actors and actresses went on to appear in ""Breakfast of Champions"", a brave attempt to bring another of Kurt Vonnegut Jr.s' books to the big screen.

I would have rated this a 10 out of 10, but Ben Affleck is in it, and his character (Like every other movie he's in) ruins parts of the movies, yet his character NEVER dies. And Bruce Willis always dies. What's with that? I need a movie where Bruce Willis kills Ben Affleck character. It can be sponsored by Afflack and it can be called ""Afflack presents: Affleck getting killed by Bruce Willis"". The title kind of gives the whole plot away, but it tells you what you're getting. Despite the sometimes choppy directing (STAY ON ONE SCENE FOR CHRISTS SAKE! 2.3 seconds IS NOT ENOUGH TIME FOR ME TO TELL WHATS HAPPENING!"") and Affleck's performance, this movie rocked. What makes it more awesome is they are actually filming at NASA, the first (and only) film to do so. They are using authentic NASA spacesuits valued at over 2 million a suit.

As a result, none of the ""action"" sequences are at all interesting.  The movie is two hours worth of ""throw away"" scenes which are connected merely by the fact that they share common actors.

I have enjoyed most Willis films, I'm not immune to Liv's charms and Billy Bob is a good actor. Despite these positive elements, this film is a complete failure. I had to stop the videotape because the story was laughable and the characters lame. I can't believe Michael Bay also directed The Rock, one of my favorite action films. The main annoyance of this movie is the poor, seemingly non-existent editing. There might be a good movie here somewhere, but if so, it is buried in a 2 hour and 30 minute montage of effects, clichés and poorly conceived characters. This movie is pure drivel, lacking any sincerity or conviction.  It's the end of the world, but I don't feel any urgency or genuine emotion until it's far too late in the proceedings.

Despite the heavy subject matter, there's more clowning around in this movie than in most comedies. The  attempts at humor in this film were lost on me. I mean, is this  comedy, drama, adventure or suspense?The script was not convincing in any of these areas. Bruce Willis has done excellent work in 12 Monkeys, The Fifth Element, Pulp Fiction and other films. Here, Armageddon's desultory, louder-is-better approach works against him, Liv Tyler, Billy Bob Thornton, etc. This movie really disappointed me.",Armageddon

Additionally, the characters garner little sympathy, in my opinion.Fortunately Owen Wilson, Bruce Willis and cast save the film from total oblivion with comedy and fun antics.  Willis shooting golf balls at a Greenpeace ship is simply hilarious.  The fx are great, flattening cities and the like.Compared to it's ""sister"" movie Deep Impact, Armageddon lacks in credible science, but excels in acting ability.  Storyline for Deep Impact is a bit more realistic, but slower.If you want to have a fun ride, and are not much worried about plot and science, take some time to view this pop culture hit.",Armageddon

Read on true believers!  Anyway, those big government types (red phones, secret meetings, and all other cliches)decide the best way to blow this sucker up is to send a rantang group of oil drillers with a nuke up into space to blow her up.  Why oil drillers you may ask?  Why, to drill into the asteroid of course.  Let's give a moment of silence for all reality to leave us so we don't feel too insulted.Thank you.  So, the government picks ""the best of the best"", who contain: an over protective father (the natural leader), his would be son-in-law he attempted to kill with a high powered rifle on the oil drill, a fat guy, a black guy who looks remarkably a lot like Vingh Rahmes), and the pasty slime ball guy whose there simply to bring up ""how we're all going to die"" a hundred times.  Oh, did i mention that they train these guys all to fly up into space, land on an asteroid AND blow it up successfully so fragments don't hit the earth ALL in 3 days?  No?

There are 2 types of sci Fi movies: start wars and real space. This one tries to be the latter but became the other.

After reading many reviews and comments I have the impression that people were expecting some sort of deep and insightful look into humanity and society... but I think that it's easy to see that this movie never promised anything of the sort, and was not trying to achieve that. It is an action blockbuster of the end- of-the-world sort. Clearly this movie is out to entertain at all costs- which it does in spectacular fashion. The cast is awesome- some find Bruce Willis overbearing but he always delivers in these situations; Ben Affleck hasn't looked this hot since before or after this movie. The script and screenplay is dramatic and in appropriate this-could-be-the-end style, and i seem to be the only one that found it very funny (in the appropriate parts!). The special effects are, of course, great- and I love the fact that the asteroid is almost turned into a character itself. Quite frankly I think you just need to let yourself go with this movie: don't ask questions, don't think about it, just let your emotions go. It does actually have a ( yes slightly corny) message about humanity's ability to band together in the face of adversity, which i think is always a nice reminder.

The advantages of this movie is that it will alert space lovers out there how deep the real danger of an asteroid falling to space really is.

Romance means two beautiful people, Action means pyrotechnics, noise, and a shaking camera, Tension means that the world cannot be saved before the red digital readout shows ""0:00:01"".

529,Wes-26,"""A Great Ride""",7,30 January 1999,"I could really care less for what Gene Siskel thought of this movie.  I could care less what every other critic seems to say about this movie.  This movie is great, and if you can't see that then you need to open your eyes. With a creative team of Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer you know this movie will be action packed.  But, what I thought was the real selling point of this movie was the emotions that they tried to hit with the audience. When you watch the scene, in which the fallout sirens start, you can see something so human its scary and sad all at the same time, hopelessness. The cast is wonderful, blending old and new.  Bruce Willis plays Harry, the world's best oil driller.  Ben Affleck plays A.J., Harry's aspiring apprentice.  Billy Bob Thorton plays Truman, a NASA operator that relies on Harry to save us all.  Then, there always has to be the leading lady, Liv Tyler, who plays Harry's daughter and A.J.'s girlfriend.  I can agree that the depth in this movie is not what makes Oscar pay attention.  But, to counter that, I don't want to know the story of Harry's life like Roger Eibert may want to.  In a slower film I would, and maybe it wouldn't have been bad, but I DIDN'T NEED IT.  As with every Jerry Bruckheimer film the cinimatography was excellent.  He is the master at moving the camera and slowing the scene down at exactly the right time.  In other words, the camera moves beautifully.  Now, despite what you have heard, this movie has moments of blunt honesty and deep emotions.  The scene in which Grace asks A.J. if he thought that anyone in the world was enjoying a moment such as theirs, and he responds, quote, ""I hope so, otherwise what the hell are we trying to save."" was one of the truest statements made in a recent movie. Then, there is A.J. screaming I love you as he is lifted from Harry back into the shuttle.  The rawness of the emotions are what make them work. This film would have been cheesy if it was these two sitting there on their way back to earth claiming their love and respect for each other.  A true unsung hero of this movie is the character played by Will Patton.  He was seemingly dark but really was sweet.  One other member of the cast that requires mentioning is William Fichtner as Col. Sharp.  He plays the scared, ""I only do what I am told"" fly boy so well.  And, then, the character change he undergoes is all summed up by him realizing that not always are your superiors right.  It's the little moments in this movie that really make it work.  Each of these tiny moments form up to show the own big picture.  And isn't that what life's about?  Our lives are tiny memories put together to form one incredible life.",Armageddon

Cities being destroyed all over the world and a large asteroid coming toward us signify that destruction can happen anytime, anywhere, whether we're prepared or not. Nothing lasts forever, and we shouldn't take our lives or our world for granted because everything could change in the blink of an eye.Secondly, it shows how complicated relationships can be. Not just intimate relationships, but relationships with family and friends as well. We can treat each other poorly, we can be distant, we can fight, but we can also choose to set aside our issues, set aside our differences, be selfless and care for each other, and repair relationships. When we are faced with destruction and danger, we can realize how valuable those in our lives really are. We don't need to go around treating each other badly, and in the end we shouldn't just focus on negative feelings and emotions because they take up too much energy and bring unnecessary suffering and negativity into our lives. If we make peace with everything and everyone, we can truly be happy, even if we are faced with destruction. Never take your loved ones for granted, and take a few seconds of your day to tell them you love them, are proud of them, etc.Thirdly, anybody can be a hero. Whether you're a pilot, an oil driller, a parent, a regular working man, or even a homeless person (not meant to be derogatory, I myself have been homeless more than once), you can be a hero. You can muster the strength and compassion and courage to do something amazing for someone or even for yourself. It could be a small act like a kind remark to someone who is suicidal to remind them that they matter and adding happiness to their life and in turn making them think twice about taking their life and putting them on the path to a happier life, or it could be a large act like jumping in front of a bullet and risking your own life to save somebody else. No matter who you are, you can be a hero.Finally, in any task, we need to have the dedication, strength, and perseverance to follow through, because it could be life changing. It can be very rewarding. You can teach an old dog new tricks, and you can do anything if you put your mind to it.Again, I agree that this situation is totally unrealistic and some people can view the movie as stupid, and you're absolutely entitled to your opinions, but try looking deeper into the movie to find the messages and figure out what they mean for you.

But as a whole, it clicks. I've read reviews complaining about how the film was edited, but if it was not editing in the manner it was, it would have been interminable experience to sit through. (It was a two and one-half hour movie. It did not feel like a two and one-half hour movie. That is a sign of...GOOD EDITING..)Let's look at some of the bits in the film: you have a bunch of roughneck oil drillers who have commissioned to save the world. To take it a step further,you have the realm of society that people would call losers that world has ask jump into the void and redeem the world from darkness.I could be wrong, but this kind of sounds like something from The Good Book....(actually, many Good Books...)You know, despite of the ZA-ZOOM comic book surface, Director Michael Bay is doing some fairly deep stuff that is worthy of William Blake. I won't spoil how this winds up, but someone does something in this film that can be best expressed in one word: messianic.I have seen this film multiple times since its release and each time, I find getting weepy each time.

And lets not even get into the basic premise, that NASA would send a bunch of hard drinking, hard fighting rough necks into space as mankind's last and only hope to save the planet.Maybe I'm being too hard, but I found this movie to be inane and pointless.

Not unless it was meant to on their part, other than that I look forward to these kind of pictures (The Rock, Con Air, Pearl Harbor).

Of course he did, but the thing I like about his filmmaking is that you can tell that he has a lot of fun doing what he loves doing. And I say keep on trucking. Not a summer goes by that i'm not looking forward to some Bruckheimer, or Michael Bay production. Bring on the explosions...",Armageddon

A) You can sit up on your high horse and whine about how inaccurate all the scientific aspects are..
B) You can sit in your Prius with a box of tissues, or on your college campus in a ""focus group"" and cry about how offensive and un-PC this movie is..

Here he has three of the finest working actors working at the mo: Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck and Steve Buscemi.The four of them, along with Liv Tyler and Peter Stormare and most of the other supporting cast give likable believable performances. The action sequences are  good, high-paced and very exciting.This movie reminded me of ""The Full Monty"", a group of losers take on a task they are completely unqualified to do, and then pull together, needing each other emotionally, to do whatever is needed to get the job done. It attempts an intelligent ending, and has an enjoyable interesting plot.Best performance in the film goes to the excellent Billy Bob Thornton, who is even better here than he is in ""Simple Plan"" or ""Slingblade"". Compared to the other blockbusters this year - Deep Impact, Godzilla, Avengers - definitely the only one worth watching.",Armageddon

By my opinion, most of those ""bigger than life""- movies are. Like I said, it was entertaining, but it was definitely not a good film. The dialogue must contain several hundreds of clichés, and over all, the talking is very cheezy. They say things that only someone like a well-trained academic would say. And the happenings are very ""illogical"". But I can't for sure say if the  scriptwriter and the director are both totally out of their minds, or if the film was being cut down quite a lot, so that we, as the audience, miss some relevant happenings an dialogue. Anyway, it was a terrible script, but the visual effects are astounding. Especially the Paris destruction sequence. And the one in the beginning. Must have taken half a year to make. At least. But the effects was the only good part of this film.",Armageddon
553,Maverick-63,A Republican Manifesto?,4,22 April 1999,"The Criterion Armageddon DVD is very good, some decent extras. I still question Criterion's poor lack of judgment in releasing the DVD at all, though, since there are so many quality movies that would more greatly benefit from a Special Edition Criterion treatment. As usual, though, the Criterion DVD is technically over-rated. The sound on the entire Extras DVD is extremely poor, and is just very hard to listen to at all.More interesting, though, is that on a second viewing it becomes kind of obvious what a Republican manifesto the whole movie is. Michael Bay's gag reel on the Extras DVD largely consists of Billy Bob Thornton's stereotypical and offensive gay impressions. Greenpeace is portrayed unsympathetically early on in the movie protesting the oil drilling (is that even a real cause of theirs? Save the oil?). Bruce Willis, the hero, shoots his gun all over the oil well, like a crazed NRA member. Maybe I am way off-base, but some of these images (especially Billy Bob's meanness) made me upset.

If you want to see a movie about what might really happen on earth if a comet was headed this way, see Deep Impact.Just a few problems (of the tons) I have to point out are: 1) It takes 2 to 3 days to reach the moon, not minutes.  2) When creating gravity in space by spinning an object, the forces are outward!!! 3) The US government does dumb things, but would never be dumb enough to send these morons into space. 4) If there is almost no gravity, what holds the drills down so that they can be pressed into the ground?

The film is on a par with Air Force One and Deep Impact, and is similarly filled with gung-ho American flag waving - the pastiche, token Russian character is positively insulting.Armageddon is somewhat reprieved by its special effects, but I still found myself rooting for the asteroid in the hope that it might wipe out Hollywood and save us from any more films like this.",Armageddon

First, the storyline: Okay, the education of an astronaut would take (i guess) about 5 years at least. To show some construction workers how to dig holes using a compressed air breaker would approximately take 5 to 20 minutes (depending on the intelligence). So why don't they teach highly-educated astronauts to dig holes instead of teaching some mental screwed-up guys to fly an spacecraft? It can't be too hard, believe me. And those spaceships, they fly with about 14.000 km/h through a field of meteorits? I would say at this speed a particle the size of ca. 1 cubic centimeter (about the size of one marble) would make the whole spacecraft bust into a million pieces.

Basically, the film is about a bunch of oil drillers who get chosen to go into space and save mankind by destroying an asteroid!!  Ben Affleck, as usual, can't act his way out of a paper bag and makes a fool out of himself in the ""animal crackers"" scene. In fact, almost nobody in this film is saved from its horrible wrath. Did anyone read the screenplay?  Does Michael Bay know how to effectively shoot a steady shot?  Is there any film with more shots of the American flag than this one?

Quite simply one of the best disaster movies out there, packed with emotion, tension, humour, romance and action. The bond between the characters is really amazing, you actually feel the friendship between them all. The way the film builds up, introducing the characters in their own element first adds to this. Bruce Willis is great as Harry Stamper, the best oil driller in the world. The government brings him in with the intention of drilling deep into an asteroid on a collision course with earth and dropping a bomb to split it into two. There is no two ways about it, he accepts the job in order to save mankind. They are rushed through basic astronaut training and sent up into space and thats where things really take a turn. The movie is highly enjoyable for many people. People who might not like it are people who think they are cleverer than everyone else and read too much into every minor detail. This is a blockbuster, leave your brains at home and enjoy!! Deep Impact is another movie based on a similar scenario but doesn't come close to this movie.

In far too many respects, I get the feeling that plot elements, dialogue, or settings are inserted because of their mass appeal, and how they will look in 30-second TV spots. This is to action films what ""Moonraker"" was to the James Bond series: an utter contrivance, in which characters and logic are sacrificed in order to set up an unlikely but visually spectacular situation. Just as Bond was returned to his roots in subsequent films, we can only hope that those responsible for this film realize that they've pushed the envelope (and their luck) far enough. Now that we've narrowly avoided extinction from an incoming Texas-sized cliché, one hopes that the next film from Bruckheimer features a better plot and more intelligence, not a bigger disaster with a dumber redneck hero.

The whole thing feels like nothing more than a trailer with its jittery cutting and sound-bite happy dialogue.  The funny thing is, it still ended up being the most boring, predictable film of the year.  This, added with the fact that we see some great actors (Billy Bob Thornton, Steve Buscemi, Ben Affleck) selling themselves out for a good paycheck, and this is also the saddest film of the year.  The effects are lackluster, the human element is totally absent, and any real tension is destroyed by the ridiculous plot.  Truly a stinker, in every sense.",Armageddon

Just like last year, the film that came out earlier was better and more successful.  Although Armageddon made more money, Deep Impact had a much smaller budget to begin with.  Therefore making a larger percentage gain. Armageddon had terrible acting. The special effects were good but there was nothing groud-breaking.  However, that is the definition of a summer blockbuster.  If they wanted an Oscar winning performance, they would have had an entirely different cast.  In my opinion, Deep Impact was the better film. If you're looking for lots of FX, loud noises, and numerous one-liners, see Armageddon.  If you're looking for plot, acting, and a movie that won't ruin your ears, see Deep Impact.

Intro scenes are the only good part of the movie. I don't know what Bruckheimer wanted with this movie. Is it a parody, comedy or he wanted to be serious or it is just mix of all stuff ? I think he just wanted it to be a Bruckheimer movie but this time he really crossed the line of good taste. I laughed where I wasn't suppose to and sometimes I was dead serious where I should have laughed because I just couldn't believe how far they are going in absurdity. It is just typical American-Hollywood cowboy stuff bulls****. Story is so shallow. The sad thing is that it made 200 million. I find the subject to be too serious for me to find any fun in this movie. They tried to pull something out with love story and Bruce's sacrifice for us all.

While the story is fascinating about what would happen to the earth from an asteroid collision it is not very realistic that something from the earth could stop the collision. From a technical viewpoint some of the parts are not realistic and the whole thing plays more on flashing views of objects moving around the ships and a lot of disturbing noise.

However, in defense of the movie, I've never enjoyed such a horrible movie this much.  The rhythm of the scenes is perfect for outside comments.

All of them seemed to work well together. Their character just fit them. Lots of people didn't like this movie for they believed that it is too far fetched, which isn't true.  One of NASA's theories IS to land on, and drill into a ""global killer"".  And as it is also said in the movie we don't have the budget to look for these things. Amatures are the people that usually find them.  Another thing people over look is the fact that Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer worked with NASA on the factual aspects of the movie. They didn't just make these things up.(all of this is said in the commentaries on the criterion collection) The other thing about this movie is, you have to like science, space and the things that go with it (like me ""aero_nut"").

I really believe that the love story helped this movie make money, (thats what made Titanic #1), Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck made a great couple. The chemistry between them was awesome.  Not to mention this is americans at their best,(with the help of a russian friend, who is perfectly cast as stormare). The love song to this movie is definitely a topper, Dianne Warren has graced so many movies with her songs and this has to be the best so far. Furthermore very few rock bands can sound good with a orchestra, (G-N-R is one) and Aerosmith certainly fit the bill here.  i love this cast  the movie and the soundtrack, but thats just me.",Armageddon
586,carltonnick,probably the worst movie of the past 10 years,1,23 October 2001,"I used to like some of the Hollywood action blockbusters of the 80s. They had icons such as Arnie and Sly but I think the action movie in the '90s has plummeted to new depths. The worst of these, I believe, was Armageddon.
The plot is shamelessly contrived and pulls off the worst cliches as it seeks to excite viewers. The melodrama is so cringingly saccharine and awful that you actually cannot wait for Bruce Willis to disappear from the screen. Liv Tyler, who had acted admirably in several fine independent features directed by such masters as Bernardo Bertolucci and Robert Altman, regrettably decided to jump onto the commercial bandwagon. This movie symbolises the new Hollywood aesthetic of grand special effects and precious little good dialogue or authentic melodrama. That is the norm these days and I begin to wonder if there is a role in Hollywood for screenwriters. It seems as though they just employ hacks and committees to write the facile scripts. The rest they leave to technology. There is not a single piece of grand, heartfelt human emotion in Armageddon. It just feels empty and bland. I can think of only one good aspect of this movie and that involves Liv Tyler's dad who doesn't even make an appearance in the film. Steven Tyler's band Aerosmith provide a theme song for the movie - a ballad that really soars and at least tugs at the heartstrings a little when the end credits come up.I weep for Western civilization if people like this predictable, cumbersome movie. It stands for shallowness, lethargy, and a decline in the human intellect. I would even prefer to watch the eighth Friday the 13th.",Armageddon

It has a great cast, Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler have never been better and Owen Wilson stands out in his very small role, and plus Billy Bob Thorton and Bruce Willis are both amazing. The shootin of the film was done amazingly. The music is top notch and the story, though sometimes a little far-fetched, grabs your attention and doesn't let go. Plus it has great humor throughout! This movie has the blessing of tugging at your heart strings without out bein overboardly cheesy. (except for one part, i will leave out.) All in all, I give this show, 8/10.

590,88L71,"No, disconnecting brain is not enough",3,10 September 2002,"* little a bit of a spoiler... but i'd wonder if you can't guess how this movie ends * Someone in here suggested just to send brain on vacation and enjoy the film... ok, this could be a good trick for most of the disaster and action movies out there, but IMO it just can't work for Armageddon. I mean, we can avoid to care about the macroscopic goofs of the plot... that asteroid, first of all, is not an asteroid but a planet, it's just weird to think we cannot see an object of such dimensions if not 18 days before it crashes on earth, and how the heck could you break it in two parts just putting a bomb 800 ft underground?? If it really has the dimensions of Texas it must have a diameter of several hundreds of Km, no matter how flat it is, the smaller diameter must be at least about 150 Km, what can a bomb do at 800 ft??? Just a crater, that is, and anyway a complicate mathematic calculus and precise estimations should establish the exact place where to drill and put the bomb, not just ""land somewhere where the ground is softer and do your work"", and if the ""asteroid"" takes a rotatory movement because of the moon gravity effect you can't just keep the old plan 'cause there's a precise moment in which to detonate the bomb, or one of the two fragments could keep running towards the earth... and so on... But as I said, who cares about that, the real problem here is that everything is too manifestly predictable... you just need to know what the movie is about and you'll know what will happen... ok, maybe you can't know exactly who'll die and who'll live, and who'll be the hero (but you can guess), but nothing, really NOTHING, can surprise you, even just a little, along this story.

He and his band of equally dysfunctional coworkers are called upon by NASA to SAVE THE WORLD! from an ENORMOUS METEOR! that threatens the existence of all life on Earth, and ONLY America CAN SAVE MANKIND! They plan to land a crew on the asteroid and drill a hole in it, then drop a nuke down the hole and blow the asteroid clean in half, which each piece heading off at an angle that means it will miss the Earth. Once again, NUKES SAVE MANKIND!I'd sooner stare directly at the sun through a telescope for a few hours than watch this piece of trash again, it would certainly be less painful.

No matter how much gilding you put on a turd, it's still a turd, and this one's a real stinker.  Stick a bunch of stars in it, and it's *still* a turd.

Suspension of belief, fine, I can do that, and I will willingly do that in a fantasy (LotR) or science fiction (2001) setting, and good fiction draws you in your without even realizing it, but this is none of those.  Truly awful acting across the board, sickly-sweet patriotism, ham-handed special effects, sophomoric dialogue, implausible plot, Armageddon has them all.

598,thegouch23,Suspend your disbelief - you have to,6,3 November 2004,"Right before the turn of the millennium, all these apocalyptic Armageddon films (Deep Impact, End of Days, even South Park Movie anyone?) were hugely popular. Fascinated by the seemingly impending disaster of the Y2K phenomenon, we moviegoers flocked to the theaters like sheep to see these films, caught up in a monotony of ""End of the World"" scenarios. However, Armageddon somehow stood out compared with the others.Maybe it was the cast. The star filled cast of Willis, Thornton, Affleck, Tyler, Buscemi, and Wilson is a start, but the performances were actually quite good under the circumstances. Harry Stamper (Willis) is believable as a lifelong oil driller. Affleck, not so much, but in the defining role of his career (to that point), he did a good job. Though the scripting of his love for Stamper's daughter (Tyler) is cheesy at best, by the end of the movie there seems to be a real connection between the two. It's not by any means a masterful script, but then nor does it pretend to be. It's a special effects action romp on an imaginary asteroid hurtling towards the earth at (literally) breakneck speed. Forget how corny it seems that the setbacks keep occurring one after another. Forget the mistakes with the actual physics of space - ""Fire in space? How?...There's no air!"" as well as a scene where someone tosses a pipe in the air and it actually comes down (""This asteroid is so big it has its own gravitational pull?"") - Forget all that. If you analyze anything here, it won't work. But then if you analyze the Ninja Turtles, Spider Man, or the X-men, they won't work either. While Armageddon will undoubtedly fall short of the ranks occupied by those comic book/video game (and now film) deities, that doesn't mean it can't be enjoyed, even by those of us who do have, and like to use, our brains. Just sit down, grab some popcorn, suspend your disbelief, and watch the movie. And when it's over, don't discuss it except to give praise to the actors where it is due, talk about the cool effects, or mention the awesome Aerosmith song ""I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing.""

Let's put aside a few issues such as training oil riggers to be astronauts rather than astronauts to work drilling machinery; that the explosive device most likely would not have had an effect on an asteroid the size of Texas; or that that the asteroid would not have generated enough gravity for the crew to walk on; or most unforgivable, the person who was specifically asigned to the crew because he knows about this ""U.S. built bomb"" but has forgotten whether he should cut the red or blue wire; all this could have been overlooked if it wasn't for the weak script, dull action scenes and distinct lack originality. If you want to watch a film with a meteor in it then try Maximum Overdrive or if you want a generic world ending disaster movie you won't have to look hard to find a better one.

Comparing Armageddon to Godzilla, one of most awful pieces of crap ever made, is simply obscene. For what it's trying to be - pure entertainment - this is one of the best ever.",Armageddon

I'm sorry to say that more and more movies are done this way - even if Michael Bay is extreme. What ever happened to the camera techniques that were used in superb movies like Escape from New York and so on...? The movies ""flow"" is slow, but still very exciting and, according to me, has much more ""feeling"" about it.... Hopefully more people agree with me. And don't get me started about slow-motion ;) Yep, slow-motion is too slow, and again you feel like watching a trailer...

625,artunst,There is one word to explain it,10,27 September 2000,"O.K.  Whether you like it or not, you can't disregard Armageddon.  Some listings list the movie as the 13th box office hit of all times.  However, to be more realistic, we can be sure that it's in the first 30's. Yes.  I accept every bad word told about the movie.  That it's not scientifically appropriate, that the plot has weak points etc.  BUT SO WHAT????  Film making is an art form and you can't question the artist if there are people worth $600 million of box office, willing to see the movie. You can not tell the film maker how to make a movie.  Armageddon was made to attract people's attention and it succeeds in it.  You can't deny that.. However, what makes it so successful?  The answer is, IT'S DIFFERENT!!. The idea that an astroid the size of Texas (although scientifically inaccurate), the idea that ""a bunch of retards that General Kimsey wouldn't trust with a potato gun"" go up to space and save the Earth etc..  I can't count them all up but the movie is really different.  The characters are filled with delicate humor and sarcasm.  Also, the plot involves points that lead to very interesting visuals.  They are sending up two shuttles and each take off at the same time, side by side.  And continue on their journey together until they reach the astroid.  NOW THAT'S SOMETHING.  Think about watching two shuttles taking off and making a journey together.  They recreated the mission room of the NASA space center just because it wasn't cool enough.  Also, who can explain me why there are black lights in the shuttles?  Or, why the colors reflecting from the actors' faces change from red to green then to blue in take-off.  SO WHAT?  These are all done on purpose!  To make the film look cool.  And it DOES achieve it.",Armageddon

You just lost 5 points for accepting to direct a film with such a bad story line. 5/10. Wait, because it is sci-fi, I'll give you back .5 point. 5.5/10. Now if you have trouble with sci-fi movie, why bother being at the show at the first place? Now this is when the cast, the OST and the scriptwriter save the day. Each of the actors, actresses of this movie perform an extraordinary effort. If you don't cry when seeing Harry Stamper's last moment, I suggest you get over yourself already. Steve Buscemi, Bruce Willis, Peter Stormare and Owen Wilson add enough funny moments for a sci-fi movie. 8/10. Way to go, Bay. The scripts add another point for Armageddon. What all the characters said is natural, sometimes funny. But natural. 9/10. Finally, you can feel the action as you go along the movie. Some so-called action movie don't have it. Why, because of the music. And the film OST: I don't want to miss a thing appear at the right time, at the right place shines the movie. It is, indeed one of the best OST. 10/10.People often have a problem. They watch too much garbage before and when it comes to Armageddon, they become null.

It was not mindless fun/entertainment. Go see Face/Off for that.  Armageddon is a fractured, over-stylized mess of not much more than spliced rip-offs of music videos and television commercials. If my memory is correct, as the climax neared, the cutting between scenes increased in frequency.  It got to the point when I didn't even know who was dying or who was surviving on the asteroid, and I was too dazed from the strobe-light effect of the MTV/zero attention span cutting to care. Constant movement does not necessarily equal good action, in my opinion. Therefore, I give this movie a 1.

Michael Bay is just one of those directors who puts on a show for the masses. I don't think it's all that different than Roland Emmerich or even James Cameron and Steven Spielberg. Don't get me wrong, Cameron is far more skilled at story telling and at redefining the movie experience but you'll never see Cameron do a Scorsese type movie. Spielberg does the same thing. Heck, he exec produced Transformers which Bay directed. Spielberg just has a unique talent when it comes to almost all kinds of movies. He's not type cast while Bay is pigeonholed.

Sad to say, it's films like this that give popcorn blockbusters a bad name: screechy, empty, stupid. I don't mind checking my brain at the door of the local cineplex for a couple of hours, but I do mind when it's clear the screenwriters checked their brains even before they sat down at their Macs. That's probably a prerequisite for anyone who works with ""director"" Michael Bay, whose idea of entertainment is to trap the audience's collective head inside the cinematic equivalent of a pinball machine and then proceed to batter it into a coma. I guess that's someone's idea of good time. Hey, if you're that someone, knock yourself out, or rather have Bay do the job for you. It's part of his contract. Like most Bay atrocities, this damn thing is excruciating to watch. I found myself gripping the armrests of my seat,not because of the growing suspense unfolding on the screen but because of the sheer cynical crassness of the whole enterprise. There are the mechanically orchestrated ""beats,"" the paint-by-numbers characters, the flat dialogue, the cheesy jokes. Oh, well, at least one of the writers, J.J.

The endless string of one-liners, and the unnecessarily melodramatic scenes between Tyler and Willis were enough to make me sick. The three week old Milk-Dud I found wedged in my seat left a better taste in my mouth.And hey, did anyone out there figure out why they had those gatling guns on the drill tractors? Was it solely to shoot through the ""unbreakable"" side of that space shuttle, or were they expecting the Martians to launch a surprise attack? Can you say ""plot gap""? Speaking of that space shuttle, did you ever wonder how even one person survived the crash of the shuttle that Affleck was on, much less three? Oh yeah, plot gap.I suppose the worst part about this movie (and it isn't easy picking one) was the Bruckheimer/Bey formula of blowing everything up. Every time I thought they had an inkling of a plot line going, they'd blow it up. Why was it they threw in that scene of the meteor attack on that Asian city? Was it because people were starting to experience emotions on their own? Can't have that. Ol' Jerry and Mike have to be shoving adrenaline down your throat every second.For anyone who wants to see this movie, I have a suggestion, get a hangover, run around in a circle, then go blow up a car.

655,Sim-9,An example of what is wrong with movies today.,4,28 September 1999,"Armageddon is one of the worst summer 'event' movies yet this decade. It's main problem is one that runs constant throughout Hollywood. Bad directors with no imagination. The emotional edge is tacked on in such a way that it comes across as blunted: one feels nothing. We don't even feel happy when Bruce Willis dies (because we are glad to see the back of him). For me there was nothingness.The editing is the worst that I have ever seen. It appears as though the editor, wanted to break the world record for most shots in a film. No one take must last more than 10 seconds. When it is done right (i.e. Raiders of the Lost Ark, the end sequence in Taxi Driver), the editing can astound. In this film however it nearly gave me a headache. One dizzying sequence of events moved to another, until in Popeye like fashion, I proclaimed ""I can't stand no more"".In better, more considered hands, Armageddon may have become a classic of it's kind.

660,achrya,Watch Space Cowboys instead!,1,31 March 2002,"A lot of people on this site have said it before: this is a bad movie.Not just a bad _film_ - I wasn't expecting ""Wild Strawberries"" - but a bad _flick_, in that it's tedious and yawn-inducing when not nerve-grating.There is a bunch of characters with a comical potential, whose development gets tossed on the dung heap in favor of shrieking hysteria. The so-called suspense boils down to a couple of ""dramatic"" countdowns and last-minute saves that might have been picked up from any action cutting-room floor. And romance??? Gimme a break! When all the women in evidence are either twerps or bitches? Surprise, we aren't in 1940 anymore. And, incidentally, we aren't in 1960 either. Round about then I was a kid somewhere in East Europe, and the flag-waving in Armageddon brings back all sorts of creepy memories. So it's the Stars and Stripes instead of hammer and sickle - same difference when you get it jammed down your throat.Interestingly, I happened to watch Armageddon within two days of Space Cowboys. The similarities are striking, and Space Cowboys actually achieve a lot of what Armageddon attempts and flops at. Space Cowboys genuinely integrate comedy, drama and romance throughout the entire film in a way that Armageddon achieves only in the sales pitch. Yes, it's another entertaining Hollywood movie and as such basically predictable, but it does keep one's interest up as to _how_ the unlikely crew will manage to save the world. The characters - men and women - do rise off the cardboard and inspire genuine feelings of sympathy, identification, suspicion, or hate, as the case may be. And, just as a sample, contrast Space Cowboys' truly touching final trip to the Moon with the tacky, soppy, unintentionally comical finale of Armageddon!So, for a bit of honest space action entertainment, skip Armageddon and put your video rental money on Space Cowboys.",Armageddon

I must confess that it's better than it (to me) but it really is a problem to me.Personally I didn't like Armageddon but I just wanted to hightlight an important problem of this kind of action movies: the credibility and realism. Just an exemple particular to this movie: these kind of spacial missions require years, to prepare and to reach their objectives (if they ever reach them!).

Constant, even gravity on the Mir? Yeah, right. Slingshot around the moon in less than a minute? Maybe in the Starship Enterprise. Split the asteroid in half with 1 nuke, only 800 feet below it's surface? That's like trying to split an apple in half with a capgun cap buried half a centimeter under it's skin. And don't get me started on the editing. I don't know what's gotten into filmmakers these days, but I like for movies to at least stay with one shot long enough for me to tell what's going on. The ""monkey on crack"" editing style of this movie gave me a headache fifteen minutes in.Other problems include the fact that at the end of the movie, not only did I not care a bit about any of the characters, I couldn't even tell you their names. There was not a single moment of genuine emotion in this entire movie. Every time they wanted a reaction, they'd crank some Aerosmith music to tell you how you should feel in that scene. I honestly felt no emotional attachment to anyone in this movie. Other things just made no sense at all, like the machine guns on the moon rover things they had. What was that about? Were they expecting to find Marvin the Martian on the asteroid and riddle him with bullets?Bad editing, no emotion, bad script, bad, bad science. It all adds up to bad movie.

I, personally like brainless action movies, but there has to be a limit. My limit came when I saw this piece of Hollywood garbage. I won't go into the plot or details of innacuracy, everyone else has done such a great job of that already. I just want to say that the reason some feel so passionate about this is because we have seen certain movies that show the heights of the creative mind at work, you can see the sweat of Welles when you watch ""Citizen Kane"", Kurasawa's passion in almost anything he's done, and even today watch Kenneth Brannagh's ""Henry V"" and you see an incredible acheivement in filmmaking. When I watch a film I want to see the work, the passion, the love of film. I feel when you watch something like this there was no passion(except for a quick buck), no love of the movies or the audience, nothing but macho flag-waving cliches.Just so you know, some of the great action flicks that actually have some meaning and passion behind them include: First Blood, Saving Private Ryan, Leon:The Professional, Lawrence of Arabia, The Longest Day, and tons more I can't remember right now.

It is meant to be an Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi movie, and it definitely lives up to this.  It is what it is. Many people have tried to compare it to Apollo 13, but that's like comparing apples and oranges.  They are entirely different fruit. Apollo 13 is based on a true historical event (Docu-drama), while Armageddon is an Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi movie.  It has plenty of action and adventure, a lot of humor, and a bit of romance.  Is the story realistic? Not hardly, but name ANY Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi movie that is.  That's why they call it Science FICTION... For those who criticize this movie, nothing will change their minds. However, if you HAVEN'T seen Armageddon, take a chance, watch with an open mind and try not to let all these negative reviews spoil your enjoyment of a really fun movie.

You never really got to know those characters, and when the astronauts had to crash straight into the comet (which was nothing compared to the Texas-sized asteroid) i could've cared less. I didn't care if Elijah's character saved his wife, or if they all died. But in Armageddon you find yourself falling in love with all the diverse personalities of each character. Harry Stamper with his deep love for his daughter, A.J. Frost with his ""I'll do it my way"" attitude, Oscar Choi with his hilarious comments, Bear with his kindness, Rockhound with his obsession with women. Not to mention the wonderful cast of actors and actresses that played them: Bruce Willis, Liv Tyler, Ben Affleck, Michael Clark Duncan, Steve Buscemi, and of course the amazing talents of Owen Wilson!

This is usually fine if it has a certain limit, but this takes it over the top.  I absolutly hate it when they manipulate the laws of physics to fit a script rather than the other way around.

To much Micheal Bay explosions and to much bright flashes. Do not watch this movie in the dark. Your eyes will hurt.The acting is okay. It could have been a lot better.

Not only does this movie have the A list Willis but also an amazing supporting cast with afleck, Duncan, buscemi, Wilson, Patton, and most impressively Billy Bob Thornton who is amazing in this role.

681,Sleeper_1972,"Put Your Guns Down, I'm Not A Michael Bay Fanboy!",10,10 March 2008,"I don't belong to the apparent elitists who despise Michael Bay's film-making because he doesn't direct Schindler's List or Pulp Fiction, but I don't belong to the fanboy cult of Michael Bay either, I just enjoy a good movie every once in a while and Michael Bay just so happens to have a few of them on his resume. Michael Bay is to big budget action movies as Hitchcock is to thrillers or George Lucas is to science fiction. He makes films that are loud, fast, action-packed and quite frankly, fun to watch. Isn't that what movies are supposed to be about? Armageddon was probably the most anticipated movie of 1998 (other than maybe Saving Private Ryan) . I'd rank it in my top two or three of 1998 (The others being Saving Private Ryan and American History X). It's not the next Schindler's List and it doesn't strive to be. It stars Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler in the main roles. The supporting cast is underrated, well-balanced and fun to watch, from Michael Clarke Duncan, Owen Wilson and Steve Buscemi down to lesser know actors Marshall R. Teague and Jessica Steen.Yes, the plot and premise may not be the most believable, but neither is King Kong, Lord of The Rings or Star Wars. These pseudo-critics on IMDb whine about ""poor science"" behind the movie, or the poor plot or the stereotypical cast. You know what? Who friggin' cares? It's a movie that's made for sheer fun, for entertainment, for bringing your family to enjoy a couple of hours of action, thundering explosions, fast vehicles and a little romance. Armageddon, despite what the Ebert and Roeper apprentices in here think, is entertainment at its best. Stop whining and enjoy yourself.We are all familiar with the story by now. An asteroid the size of Texas is on path to impact with Earth, which would destroy all forms of life on it. The world only has 18 days until impact. The only way to stop it is to blow it up from the inside by drilling to its core. For that, NASA recruits the worlds's best deep-core driller in Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) and his renegade drilling crew. The crew, along with some NASA astronauts and an unlucky Russian cosmonaut, journey to the asteroid and embark upon the mission to destroy it and with that, save the entire planet.Along the way, the crew endures despite losing lives, having to overcome huge obstacles, and having to make decisions that will affect not only the world but themselves. The movie is filled with a few emotional moments that will bring tears to some eyes, a score that is grandiose and is a large part of the film, and strives to be patriotic and the cinematography reflects it. I couldn't help but feel patriotic and moved while watching the movie. The sound and visual effects in the movie were awesome, which its four Oscar nominations reflect. (Home theater aficionados will also appreciate the visual and sound effects in this movie).This movie is a lot of things. It's fun, it's moving, it's sad and it's romantic. Above all, it's one of the more entertaining movies I have seen. The cast had a lot of chemistry together and seemed to have a lot of fun which is reflected in the film. This was Ben Affleck's first big box-office action movie and he gives a good first effort. Bruce Willis takes on the role of Harry Stamper with ease like the action movie veteran he is. Liv Tyler is sweet as Harry's daughter and their emotional goodbye is to be remembered.With having said all that, the Criterion Collection release of Armageddon is a treat. It offers 2 commentary tracks, one featuring the director Michael Bay, actors Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer has comments on several interesting things. Affleck's commentary is sometimes very funny. The other commentary track features the Director of Photography and special effects crew. The commentary includes interesting details, including background information on the characters and filming locations. Note: The commentary is raw and sometimes laced with profanity, although the movie itself is rated PG-13, for reasons explained in the commentary.Although it's not much, this collection is also a Director's Cut and has a couple scenes added, notable of which is Harry Stamper's character visiting his father before launch. Some other scenes are cut slightly differently, adding some depth to the story.The Gag reel on the second disk is extremely funny, raw, and not your typical ""behind-the-scenes"" documentary. The second disk also features a tremendous amount of information on the special effects and includes many different trailers and promo material. The Aerosmith music video for ""I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing"" is also included, although I've never watched it, and probably never will.In conclusion, Armageddon was the second-highest grossing film of 1998 narrowly behind Saving Private Ryan. That might be something for critics to think about, because obviously A LOT of people saw this movie. All in all, don't listen to the critics here trying to become the next ""Top 500 reviewer."" See the movie, it's a blast.",Armageddon

And could two launches have been used, instead of one just being copied and pasted.  And one more thing about the effects, I believe I could have done a better job on my computer for some of those shots.  The only fair effect was the final one.  And that was just fair.

692,McG,Not that bad...,2,19 January 2001,"...until lift-off.I was warned that this movie would be very bad by some friends, whose judgement I usually trust.I saw it anyway.At first I thought they were wrong, an entertaining start with impressive F/X, the introduction of the characters good with Bruce Willis and Steve Buscemi great as usual, dito the training scenes.I told myself: ""Hey, a little dumb but not bad, why did they pick on it so hard?""At that point the movie went downhill RAPIDLY. Everything concerned with science and engineering was an insult to everyone able to bind his shoe-laces (considering the cost of every gram launched into space, why would anyone put a cannon on the vehicles? Just in case you have to shoot yourself out of a crashed shuttle?). The pathos combined with that completely unnecessary romance made my stomach turn. At the end I didn't know whether to laugh, to be annoyed at the insult or to cry over the money lost in an attempt at being entertained.I hereby solemnly swear, never to question my friends' judgement again.2/10",Armageddon
693,Tias,"99% special effects, 1% story",2,3 August 1998,"Astonishing special effects cannot hide the incredible lack of a story in this movie. It is predictable and mostly boring. The US nationalistic blah -blah, especially towards the end, makes a non-US audience laugh in places the director never meant. Willis is doing his usual role in his usual way. Buscemi and Stormare are a lot better than the rest. The space-flying scenes with everything happening in Tom & Jerry-tempo destroys all the credibility of the fantastic impact scenes in the beginning. Everyone have seen real space-flight on TV and knows that docking in mid-space isn't done in the same manor as parking in front of the mall. The asteroid looks like something you would find in a christmas tree. I'm not saying that sci-fi should be realistic but come on - don't insult me! In total a fantastic movie where 99% of the money is spent on special effects and 1% on story and storytelling.",Armageddon
694,Zaxis,I was cheering for the Asteroid.,1,8 September 1998,"It was great to see the recycled asteroid effects from ""Lost in Space"" used in this movie.  They got their money's worth.  The story was very thin, and the characters were worse.  I feel ashamed to know people who loved this movie.  Sure, the characters were ok, but the actors had brought them in from other movies.  Each actor was playing his/her stereotypical role. Steve Buscemi made me laugh, but I'd seen that character before.  The worst offense of all was letting John McClain prospect for oil.  Liv Tyler is beautiful, but that doesn't carry a movie.",Armageddon
695,TF Bblsh,Best of the Year,10,20 September 1998,"Armageddon was a truly awesome movie, my favorite of the year.  It's Michael Bay's 3rd movie after Bad Boy's and The Rock both of which were two of my favorite movies of all time and this movie definitely makes him my favorite director.  What did I like about the movie? I liked how the characters were pretty much normal people as opposed to experts who had been preparing for something like this their whole life.  I loved the special effects.  In my opinion this movie has is no.3 of all time as far as special effects in a movie (no.1 an 2 goes to Titanic, and Independence Day.  All the actors in the movie did a good job(it's Bruce Willis's best role so far) and Steve Buscemi was hilarious , and is one of the most underrated actors in Hollywood. One seemingly minor thing I greatly enjoyed was the fact that it was a very patriotic movie, yet also was able to show what was going on around the world. Most of the scenes were done well.  The ending (which I won't spoil) is very touching, and there are about three of so scenes of glimpses of what people around the world were doing, and these were done so well(especially the one where the president was making his speech at the same time) they almost made me cry.  People say this movie isn't realistic, but what makes them such experts?  Have they ever been in a situation where an asteroid the size of Texas was going to hit the Earth and wipe out humanity? There could have been some things that weren't campletely probable, but you could say that about 99% of all movies out there. If you havn't seen this movie get off your ass and see it this second!  If you're in the mood to be entertained you probaly will be.Rated PG-13 for disaster violence, profanity, and sensualityRating:95/100t",Armageddon
696,Cheese-2,Don't waste your money!,4,21 September 1998,"I would like to say that this movie is a very bad one in all aspects except the special effects.The characters are not interesting and the story is miserably boring.In fact the the only fun thing about it is that it seems like the script writers have had some fun when putting in the number 42 in the lines at four occasions(countdown for the A-bomb,42 countries declears martial law, et.c). 42 is said to be the answer to universe,life and everything in Douglas Adams book ""Hitchiker's guide to the galaxy"" and I guess that addicted fans(like me) off the hitchikers will think that this is pretty funny.So if you haven't read that book you probably won't find anything good,fun or interesting in this movie unless you like ""America is so great""- or ""oh I think I have to sacrifice myself becouse I am such a good person""-movies then DON'T SEE IT,IT IS A WASTE OF MONEY AND TIME. MY VOTE 3/10",Armageddon

Once again America saves the world, A space cowboy is the hero, the boy hero gets the girl, his friends are a motley crew who come together in the end. Hey who wrote the dialogue? Such zingers as ""Harry, you da man!"", ""She's gonna blow!"" ""Knock it off guys!"" ""I promise I'll be back"" ""I love you man!""

For the action flick, (which it sure was) and the fx (which were superb) I gave the movie a 10, but for the heroe bull (which became anoying after the first hour of the movie) I gave it a 1.

Bruce Willis has now confirmed to me he is a money grabber to be in this movie and notice I didn't say 'star'.

But for home theater buffs, the open DVD is a super ride and a great demo for friends.  The open DVD has one of the very best Dolby Digital 5.1 sound tracks I have heard.

This is one of the few movies that really got me sitting on the edge of my seat and really lets me care for the characters. The movie looks great too and the acting is superb. I don't really know why everybody hates this movie so much but if you look at Deep Impact this movie is way better. This one is really exciting and looks better than Deep Impact.

712,Konrad-5,Don't dis this awesome movie,8,13 December 1999,"The simple reason that Armageddon was the highest grossing movie of 1998 is the fact that it is a great movie. Sure the characters were two dimensional, sure the plot was manipulative, sure the action was gratuitous, and sure it was an exercise in American flag waving - who cares! The best thing about this movie was that it didn't take itself too seriously. The script writers gave Bruce Willis the corny macho lines and then backed these up using the wit of Steve Buscemi and the bumbling russian played by Peter Stromare. Even though the characters were shallow, they are so likeable you'll be concerned for their welfare by the end of the film. And even though you can basically guess what happens by watching the trailer, the continuing crises and regular moments of tension serve to keep you in your seat. Armageddon is so much more than a comet movie, it's an action, a romance and a comedy. And besides, how can it be bad if Billy Bob decided to star in it?",Armageddon
713,bluesekai,it wasn't THAT bad,8,23 August 2000,"Alright, I've read a bunch of the reviews already written and I'm blown away by all the vitriol that has been slung at 'Armageddon.'  I'm not saying that it was the best movie of all time.  In fact, there were some things i had to roll my eyes at. However, as a whole, i would say the movie was very entertaining.  I agree with some of the other reviewers that it should be taken as what it was intended to be, just an enjoyable movie, not as a documentary on ""What to do if the earth is in danger of being hit by a large asteroid.""  Yes, it's a bit silly, a bit implausible, but that's why it's called entertainment.  I have enough realism right here at home. If there was something that I thought was ridiculous about this movie, it was the number of times that the U.S. flag appears. I'm not saying this to be un-patriotic, but PLEASE, during my second viewing I counted 137 flags.  I can understand a motif, but it was so over-done that it became a cliche.  If any anti-flag-burning legislation ever gets passed, copies of 'Armageddon' being burned will deliver stiff penalties. I think the U.S. has the potential to be a great country, but if this was the message they wished to convey, I think a movie that WASN'T about saving the world would have been more appropriate. 8 out of 10",Armageddon

Michael Bay is certainly at fault for this as his previous examples of filmmaking (Bad Boys and The Rock) were also marred by his relentlessly juvenile direction.  The ""characters"" are dull.  The plot has holes in it big enough to fit a Texas-sized asteroid.  Any sort of scientific validity for this pile of refuse is a waste of time (much like actually watching the film).  While I have nothing against any of the actors who got suckered into making this (poor Billy Bob Thorton), I do have something against filmmakers who insist on shoveling this formulaic, dumb-downed, witless pile of cliches and mediocrity on us unsuspected movie patrons.

I must feel like ""I'm in the movie"". But this interminable movie made it simply impossible, however hard I tried. Absolutely NOTHING in this movie makes any kind of sense. It's as scientifically correct as ""Spaceballs"", while trying to appear serious.
How can you like it when, every five minutes, you're going ""Man! This is ridiculous!"". After 1h45 of it, I was impatiently waiting for the end to come.

All lot of critics panned this movie but they are pleasantly invited to caress certain parts of my anatomy with their tongue.  To me this critics have just forgot what its like to have fun and be entertained at the movies.  This is pure escapism at its finest.  In my opinon this was the second best movie of the year.

And I know I'm blowing wind up your skirt now, with all the baloney's coming my way.  First of all, I want to say cheers to the many who agree.  And now my why: It is an entertainment movie.  For all of you who have seen this and expected something serious, and Oscar worthy, Buuuu!  That is your folly. This movie is great action, well placed humor, interesting settings and scenery, great special Fx, and some good jokes/messages about life of today. How else can mankind tackle an astronomical problem but with the help of all the world?  Yeah, some flag waving, but if this movie was made in Italy, I'm sure they would have the right to display their tricolor as well. Did I say anything about great acting?  No.  But I will say actors like Buscemi, Patton and Stormere deserve kudos. Plainly, this movie is fun.  It can be watched over and over.  It has good emotional value, and Michael Bay's style of directing is at times misunderstood.  At first, I found the pacing and quick cuts distracting, but that is exactly what this movie underlines; the quick time frame it all takes place in.  It is a trademark of Bay's, noticible in other films, that give this film and others their pace.  He is precise and curt, but manages to add in the subtle (upsidedown flag on Mir, the little skull head on the Armadillo's stick) points and views that make this a great film.So go ahead and rip on it, refuse to watch it.  Your loss. This is not the best film ever, but it is well done and good entertainment.",Armageddon
737,saturn0009,"Loud, Awful, Nausea-inducing Film",1,25 May 2004,"When Steven Spielberg opted to jerk and move his cameras while panning Normandy at the beginning of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" I was taken in by the gesture, as it provided realism and an honest look at the brutality of war. In other words, you felt as if you were actually there, storming the shores with those brave men.In 1998's vile ""Armageddon"" the cameras never stop moving. I wasn't waiting for the end credits to roll as much as I was patiently anticipating a scene during which the cameras did not flutter around like a bad MTV ad. To my bitter disappointment, Michael Bay's jerky direction simply--desperately--attempted to cover up a bad screenplay and script with attention-deficit disorder techniques. Bay's plan would have worked in a three minute hip hop video or a 30-second Super Bowl commercial, but he failed miserably with this epic waste of time and resources.Bruce Willis and Billy Bob Thornton are not just miscast in this disastrous pile of debris, they seem completely lost, as well. Now I first watched ""Armageddon"" on the big screen, after which I literally had to make my way to the nearest drug store for Asprin and stomach medicine. Michael Bay has mastered the art of big, empty, poorly executed motion pictures that, none-the-less, make millions at the box office. This has more to do with months of expensive advertising campaigns and shrewd publicity, for which Mr. Bay and company should be commended. But you get a candy bar rather than a nine-course meal, which makes for a quick rush rather than a fulfilling movie-going experience. And after the first ten or fifteen minutes of ""Armageddon"", you realize the rush is wearing off. Then the headache sets in.The plot is improbable at best. If you insist on torturing yourself, I'll leave the details of the climax out. But be warned: this is supposed to be science fiction and, in science fiction, it helps to base the premise on some semblance of science fact. There is none to be found here. I was not convinced that a bunch of brainless, renegade oil-diggers could blast off into space to save the world. Not for a minute. But, like I said, if you insist on buying into a senseless plot about unlikeable characters--and you actually enjoy headaches--then run to your nearest DVD retailer and grab a copy.Just don't say I didn't warn you!",Armageddon
738,kathrynatrand,"Like ""Die Hard"" you will like ""Armageddon""",8,4 April 2013,"Armageddon is what most expect from Bruce Willis; it is much like his ""Die Hard"" films, all action, not much plot, you get it without having to figure out any hidden mystery.The picture begins with NASA faced with a disaster, not a war as they first presume, rather it is a Earth destroying large meteor heading straight for earth, which all destroy all life on earth. Nuclear experts tell the heads of government no nuclear rocket will as much as deflect this huge meteor. They say it may be possible to blow it into peaces, which will pass Earth if a nuclear device was buried inside the meteor, as that will cause the needed pressure to explode the meteor, yet that is not possible because it would require humans to fly to the meteor and drill a deep hole to place the explosive in the centre. Enter Bruce Willis; he is that lone individual who lives beyond the conventions of society. He has made a career out of drilling where most cannot, or will not attempt. Like him, his men are all on the edge of social convention; they are good at one thing, drilling and taking risks and getting into trouble!. We see into Willis' character in the beginning when he finds out his one love, his daughter, has fallen in love with a man just like him, while Willis accepts being a reckless character, he does not want this life for his daughter; he has higher hopes; she should marry into respectability.Willis, it seems clear, respects and admires, yet dislikes socialites; he finds then too restrained, too civil and Willis is one of the best portraying the outcast hero with a good conscience. All his men are like him, in one way or another, they are social misfits who have a propensity for eschewing social convections. One is a genius with two doctorates, yet he prefers the high dollar rough-neck work, and loves taking risks; he is a degenerate gambler. Another is like a Hells Angel, another, the perpetual adolescent. You get the picture, they are all misfits; however, they have found a way to earn money through the most individual of them all, their boss, the one man they admire, Harry Stamper, the ultimate super ego of all tough guys!When the high government officials, who of course are the USA, as we know, when it comes to big weapons and missiles, the US is still tops at developing such devices, they locate Harry for his drilling expertise. However,Harry is not too impressed with the government trained conformists; they copied one of his drills and assembled it wrong. He tells Dan the man (played with excellence by Billy Bob, who seems believable, a feat in itself), his chosen crew are inept at doing the job and that it would take real drillers, his own men to get the job done. When the government officials meet these misfits, they cannot believe these men could follow their way to the public connivance, yet alone manage a mission for trained specialists! Here is the twist"" Dan knows it is a big risk, yet he knows it is the only chance to save the world, use derelicts, or die! Off they go with a few astronauts flying them to the meteor, salvation by the wildest! This is typical Willis at its best, just as one sane person imagines a man could do what Willi8s does in ""Die Hard"", this is a pure fiction adventure fir entertainment. There is no need for suspension of disbelief, as all this action-packed picture is not much different that comic book heroes where the bad boys have redemption.Willis dies in this one, blown into infinity by the nuclear blast, a fitting death a super hero. Now his more sane, I mean more attuned to the conventional, his daughter's love mate can take his place and be married; we assume they live happily together, taking the same risks, but A. J Frost, (played great by Ben Affleck), as the cooler man who will take replace Harry; he is not as hot as the volatile Harry Stamper-your- lights-out if you anger him. LOL! If you like pure fictional adventure and the ""Die Hard' movies, you will ;like this longer movie with none stop action. It has the same pace as ""Die Hard"" more a bizarre cast of bad boys with good hearts and us not as slow as ""Last Man Standing"", ""Unbreakable"", or ""Hostage"", along with other movies staring Willis. with the exception of ""The Jackal"", which is excellent, yet less fantastic.I would say, given its length, it is right up there with the ""Die Hard"" films and the somewhat comic tragedy ""Striking Distance"".",Armageddon

(A new house in Malibu perhaps). Saving the world has never been so dull. Michael Bay can blows things up, and he does this a lot, obviously scared that if he doesn't the audience will fall asleep. And scared he should be. Never before have so many one dimensional characters graced the screen for so long at the same time.

I like this movie because it shows us that now, humans can stop this natural nemesis. Especially now, because this movie was aired 5 years ago, I think. The actors are great and the plot is awesome. But I wondered how could a bunch of oil drillers find themselves on a trip to an asteroid? I think they were very lucky, I wish I could go into space for free.

I get sad every time I see the end of Armageddon (the conversation between Stamper and his daughter).In my opinion this is one of the best plays of Bruce Willis(along with Die Hard).Even now I can't find a flaw in his acting....it's just...perfect...

I only liked it because of the effects and directing... Yes, some random guys, being in the oil drilling work, can certainly learn to do all that has to do with being in space and working in there just in several days (?!), while it takes an ordinary astronaut trainee more years to learn this stuff and actually go out there, than it would take him to study all of nuclear physics...! Yes that's realistic... :) And 99% of the meteors do fall into America, while none (as I remember) of the mission members is of any other nationality than... American! !

Certainly, all life will end on this planet, but it will also TAKE THIS MOVIE WITH IT!!! This ranks (pun intended) as one of the worst movies I have ever seen (1950's monster movies not withstanding).  The acting is sooooo bad in this movie (Who the hell told Liv Tyler she could act???), and Bruce Willis should be completely embarrassed by this flick.  Movies such as these are the reason I save my $7 at the theater, and wait til it comes on HBO.  Of course, a lot of people will say that you can't get the full effect of the movie without seeing it on the big screen.  While that may be true, it's pretty sad that you have to judge a movie simply by special effects and only when they're seen on the big screen.One final note:  When I watch a movie about the ""end of the earth"", I really would like to actually SEE the end of the earth, and not some hokey story about 1 person saving the day at the last minute.

But I've had a better time watching a 20 year old piece of crap like ""The Dark"" or even ""Ocotoman"" than watching this ""film"".And I don't mind empty entertainment. But you have to turn off far more than usual to watch this film. You have to give up any sense of discovery, or ambiguity, because this film has neither. You have to turn off your brain entirely,  from the pacing, the limp plotlines, to the gut churning photography where a shot more than 10 seconds long that hasn't rotated, spun, zoomed or swept is a chance to let your stomach settle. The characters couldn't utter their lines less convincing ways, the supposedly great special effects were used to support such lousy science it was far more of an affront than in the old days when lousy effects went with lousy science. Every single scene looks like a cliche commercial from some product or another. Why do astronauts have to walk in slow motion? Why do they have to have an explosion of some kind every 10 minutes or less? From exploding oil wells, exploding cars, exploding space shuttles, exploding space stations, exploding astronauts, you get the idea. Just how many explosions can people see in movies before they get tired of it?   The aptly named Armageddon will doubtless be the movie Satan chooses to use to torture people in hell, and it would probably have the damned there begging to go back to burning forever or being eaten by cockroaches after about 6 minutes. The only mildly amusing thing in the entire movie is the fatalistic Russion Cosmonaut, but you'll get better value from a 10 seconds of an old Yakoff Smirnov routine.

The plot that was presented was all that was needed for a disaster movie, plus a few side stories.  An asteroid the size of Texas is headed for earth, and NASA has to employ a few of the worlds best drillers to go up into space, drill, and plant a bomb. What more do you want for an action movie about a disaster?? Armageddon is an emotional thrillride, filled with action, adventure, explosions, Bruce Willis, and most of all heart.  It has a lot of comedic interludes (some a bit silly) but it is very much welcomed in what could have been a depressing movie, like DEEP IMPACT(horrible, horrible movie). We all know what will happen.  But unlike most movies where we know the score ahead of time, Armageddon makes it fun.  Some of Hollywood's most respected actors are put through NASA training, set to cool music by Aerosmith and Trevor Rabin, and sent up to space in order to intercept an oncoming asteroid.

757,dfields-2,*This* was the highest-grossing film of 1998?!?!?,6,2 January 1999,"Well, they say that when you watch/read science-fiction, you have to leave your disbelief at the door...but this was ridiculous.  Armageddon was one long, continuous, unbelievable scene.  In the opener, a meteor falls from the sky, scoring a direct hit on a large Polynesian man, causing an explosion powerful enough to heave cars into the air, but miraculously leaving unscathed the 10-pound, so-ugly-he's-cute dog with which he'd just been fighting, as well as its owner.  From that scene, I knew my eyes were in for a painful ""oh, you gotta be kidding me"" rolling experience.  And I never did get past the fact that I was asked to believe that NASA could put together a mission to simultaneously send *two* space shuttles out past the moon to blow up an asteroid ""the size of Texas"" with one nuclear warhead (okay...they sent two, but only one was expected to be needed and, in the end, actually used) with only 18 days to work with, from the first moment they even realized they had a problem, to the end of the mission.  Come on...these are the guys who need a couple of years of planning to send one shuttle into earth orbit!  That's why we have four shuttles... so they can be rehearsing three, while one is actually putting on the show.Maybe I would've enjoyed the movie more if it hadn't been so predictable. But, not once in the entire movie did anything surprise me...from the deaths of the peripheral characters, to the time-worn use of countdowns reaching their final seconds before success is achieved.  My God, they even had a ""which wire should I cut to defuse the bomb?"" scene!  I thought we put that to rest in the Lethal Weapon series.  This is supposed to create suspense? The group I was with formed a quick pool to guess what the timer would reach when they finally shut the detonator down (""what do you think?...less than a second left?  2.4 seconds?  more than 5???"").  But was there ever any doubt that they'd defuse it?  No...not really.And I'm not even going to go into the physically-impossible special effects. I'll leave that to the people who went home after the movie and worked out the actual gee-forces that would be involved in the slingshot maneuver around the moon.  I'll just say to any director out there...please...just once in a science-fiction movie, don't let a space ship swoop and dive around asteroids, like some high-tech Piper Cub.  Space shuttles have wings so they can land, once they return to Earth...other than that, they have no use, because there is no air in space!Okay...mama always told me, if you don't have something nice to say, don't say anything.  So, on the plus side for Armageddon was Steve Buscemi's comic relief.  He actually looked like some schmuck who was pulled off the street and asked ""wanna go up into outer space?"" and had the time of his life doing it.  Liv Tyler was cute as the lone female voice in the Boys' Club.  I'm more impressed with her acting every time I see her in a new movie.  I hope she gets a shot at some truly dramatic roles someday soon, to see what she can do with them.  Bruce Willis played the same character he's played in every other successful movie he's ever done, and he does it well.  But, other than those, the other characters were derivative and predictable.I just didn't see what all the fuss was about.  They could've done this as a remake of John Wayne's Hellfighters, saved about a gazillion dollars on useless special effects, and *really* turned a profit.  Or...maybe ""Hellfighters In Space"" was what they were going for in the first place.  If so, they tried a little too hard.",Armageddon

OK, if you're one of those who rated Shawshank Redemption as the #1 film of all time, you probably won't like this movie much.But it's a lot of fun, like an amusement part ride. To enjoy it, you have to like Bruce Willis, which I know some people don't, and you have to like action-adventure movies, which some of the previous commmentators didn't seem to.  Also, Willis is playing a John Wayne type role, the good ol' boy conservative father type, so don't go looking for an eco-fable.This was the best a-a movie of 1998.  Despite what previous commentators said, the story made sense, there were no plot holes, there was never a time when I thought ""Why'd you do that, you idiot"" as I've thought with better-regarded movies like SPR.

This movie has a lot of the same feel of the previous two, but that isn't to say that it isn't a good combination.

This is a multi-million dollar movie with big name actors. Not only that, but the scientific ""facts"" they expect us to believe are insulting.  Not that I can't suspend disbelief but this was pure laziness. Using accurate information/effects would not affect the plot (or the lack there of).

I also had a hard time buying the idea that it's easier to train oil riggers to become astronauts than it is to train astronauts to drill a hole.

The music is majestic and contributes to build up tension or slow down the pace as we follow the heroes on their quest.

I was surprised over and over again at how blatantly the story disregarded what-ever happens to be on it's way to where-ever. It seems that the writers and producers collected every short cut in every sci-fi movie and then hid behind the old I didn't start it - clause.In fact when I think of what the writing process had to be like, a Monty Python sketch comes to mind. The one with Graham Chapman as the producer, and the terrified writers flying out left and right.

But instead of laughing with them, I was laughing at them (except in the case of Buscemi, of course, who was the film's only saving grace).

It doesn't matter whether the movie is scientifically correct, or ""entertaining"" for you.  The point of this movie is to GIVE PEOPLE SOMETHING TO LOOK FOR IN THEMSELVES.  All of them had some sort of problem, be it physical, psychological, or social, they all managed to find the part of themselves that was able to work together in harsh conditions and save the world.  The group of people that went up into space to do this mission was the most misfit group of people that basically could be found.  However, in the end, even the two people (A.J. and Harry) that really didn't get along managed to work together and save the world.  So what if it happened to be U.S. astronauts?, so what if the asteroid was the wrong size?, look at the basic point in the movie and judge it for that, not how accurate it is!!! Oh, and just for a little clarification, there can be a fire in space. Think about it, there has to be oxygen on the shuttle, right?, so that's where the combustion fuel is from.

And at the surface of this mantle is the crust: the final, coolest extremity of this hypothesis. It is made up of canyons of sculpture, seas of painting and mountains of poetry. These landscapes span the globe. This environment is populated with all the human souls that have ever lived. You are with them, in a city of televised skyscrapers.The date is July 1st 1998.Terrible rumours have been circulating. People have been whispering about a giant meteor. An intergalactic behemoth, they say. Something made of the same matter from which Planet Art was formed, but which is instead a grotesque parody. An abomination on a collision course. An extinction-level event.A grim face appears on the colossal screens above the city.""I address you tonight not as the President of Art, but as a citizen of humanity,"" booms a loud voice. ""We are faced with the very gravest of challenges. The cinema calls this day 'Armageddon'. It is the end of all things. All of you praying with us need to know that everything that can be done to prevent this disaster is being called into service: our ability to create plots without holes; our entrenched knowledge of basic screen writing; the grasp of logic to determine that installing a simple hatch for exiting a spacecraft makes more sense than installing a hotel elevator - with 'freedom' written upon it; the ability to understand a machine gun has no place on a NASA funded meteor drilling mission, and that 'Space Dementia' is about as likely to make a drilling expert fire bullets at mining equipment as Sea Alzheimers is to make an ecologist drop torpedoes on whale sharks; Every step up the ladder of realistic emotional expression, every adventurous reach into artistic originality; even the horrible soap operas that we've watched have provided us the tools to wage this terrible battle. Through all of the chaos that is our history; through all of the wrongs and the discord; through all of the pain and suffering; through all of our times, there is one thing that has nourished our souls, and elevated our species above its origins, and that is our integrity. The dreams of an entire planet are focused tonight on the brave movie critics travelling into the heavens. And may we all, citizens the world over, see these events through.

If a person was told that this was a comedy before watching this film, they'd believe you. It is definitely more funny than thrilling, but it does have some shockers. The camera's shots were less than desirable, and I think with a better cameraman the movie would be perfect. And also, what is the director's obsession with the colour blue?

I remember my brother got a movie poster for Armageddon and I wanted it. I recently watched this movie on encore for the first time and it touched me in the heart. Another reason I like this movie is that when I was little I was obsessed with it and it brings back good memories. I have no idea why so much people hate on this movie. This movie had a great cast and great special affects. I hate how Owen Wilson dies he is one of my favorite actors and I thought he was kinda funny in this movie.

The part where Bruce Willis's character talks to his daughter about him saying that he has to sacrifice himself to save the world by detonating the bomb made me cry because it was just, I don't know...touching. The Aerosmith song, ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing"" was an awesome song in my opinion, as a matter of fact one of my favorites. That was another thing that made me tear was the song at the end. When I saw this in the theaters, people that I saw were tearing, and I was one of them, and I don't cry much. But it was full of a lot of laughs too, such as Steve Bucsemi's character, which is fact my favorite character, almost every time he said something, almost no matter what it was, the audience was laughing.

Bruce Willis as Liv Tyler's father? The more-awful-than-usual Ben Affleck smooching Liv? Yuck! The normally excellent Steve Buscemi as a sex-crazed maniac (well, he pulled it off in Fargo, but there his character had, well, character)?

No problem - get a ride back on a different one.With films like this it would not be a shame for an asteroid to score a direct hit on California.

The concept of rugged and social castaway oil workers teaming up with NASA/Air Force officers, and even a Russian Cosmonaut, makes for a very colorful and entertaining atmosphere.  Even Affleck and Tyler's romantic bit, which detracted somewhat from the movie for me, couldn't kill the story.

But alas, somewhere in the editing room, this film was hacked up & slaughtered & another notch was added to Mr. Bay's movie-shotgun of death.This movie had everything going for it. Bombastic end-of-the-world storyline; awesome, state-of-the-art visual effects; amazing cast of actors that can actually act; and Michael Bay.... oh, & there's the rub.I hate to take part with all the overblown Bay-bashing, but-... and it's not that the guy's a hack per se. He actually knows how to stage a frame & shoot a camera. I was even a Bay fan when he first came out with ""Bad Boys"", which had lots of style, laughs and action. I enjoyed ""The Rock"" even more. But it's here with this overlong movie trailer that Bay lost me. And subsequently with ""Pearl Harbor"" & ""Bad Boys II"". And my feeling is that it's with the editing.I know he comes from TV commercials and music videos, and we do live in an MTV world, but come on. It's like, if they let a shot last longer than 5 seconds they would be afraid of losing the audience somehow. Dramatic scenes have no effect because of this, and the amazing digital fx aren't on screen long enough for the audience to enjoy. And the action sequences are too messy to follow. And I know this ain't the fault of the editors because they know too much to cut film in this style. So whether it be Bay making these choices, or the studio heads, it'd be nice for the editors to stand their ground & make the films halfway tolerable to watch.Anyways, with a film like this, you either love it or hate it.

The only enjoyment that can be gleaned from midpoint on (after the ridiculously implausible shuttle launch) is watching and pondering how this film could possibly be any worse.I guess Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay wanted to add another credit to their list of films that fall under the category of ""using corny, cheesy effects and making good actors go bad"" (see ""The Rock,"" ""Con Air,"" ""Pearl Harbor""). Such talents as Willis and Buscemi are utterly wasted; Billy Bob Thornton is even bad in an utterly useless part that serves no real purpose, other than to occasionally grimace at the horrible set of circumstances standing before him.The gaping plot holes, the cornball cinematography and direction, the dialogue (essentially a series of terrible one-liners that land with a practically audible thud every couple of minutes) - they all add up to an overstimulated, overacted, overdone mess which lacks any cohesion and, after the first hour and fifteen minutes or so, only succeeds in eliciting a splitting headache for the viewer.Avoid at all costs.",Armageddon
810,syncopation,Worse than all the spoofs,4,8 January 2007,"Half of the movie is is flashing lights and shaky camera. The rest is made up of predictable characters (think science vs. government, 'know-how' vs. authority, etc.) What is the worst aspect about this movie? Is it the cars being thrown around in the first 5 minutes, is the horrible 'Russian' accent of the 'cosmonaut', is it the uninspired characters, the poorly integrated Top 40 hits, or the ""US will save the world"" vitriol? No. It's the fact that regardless of the ""sad"" ending - there is very little suspense in this movie - we basically know what's going to happen.The one good part of this movie: ""American components, Russian components: all made in Taiwan!""",Armageddon

This is not only the best overall movie ever made, but it is the best By Far! It has it all! It was amazingly written, with half a dozen one liners. Some funny and some heart pounding. It has action, adventure, comedy, drama, romance, amazing special effects and the best overall ending I personally have ever seen! The cast was Amazing! Their a great collection of actors and actresses who truly make you feel like their living those lives! And all this in an Action/adventure movie!! You just don't find Everything all wrapped up into one movie very often and especially done this well!

This movie is about A man who loves a woman, and the man is scorned upon and (laughably) shot at by the woman's father. Then, there is a massively terrible threat that may wipe out all that this father cares about, so he assembles his team and strives to save what he loves. At the end of the movie is one of the most touching scenes in any movie, where the father sacrifices himself in order to save all of humanity, namely his daughter and her lover, so that they may marry each other and live a happy life. If that isn't a good message then I don't know what is.

All of the actors and actresses did an outstanding job in this movie, which made it all the better. This movie was excellent, and I would have to claim temporary insanity if I didn't give it a 10 on the ratings. I love this movie, and anyone who hasn't seen it yet is seriously deprived.

Oh wait - it's the movie industry we're talking about here. To summarize - the entire Earth manages to miss detecting an asteroid/comet (the movie is never entirely sure which) ""the size of Texas"" (that is 2-3 times the width of Ceres, the largest asteroid) until it's too late, resulting in -OMG!- 18 days to save humanity. ***SPOILERS FOLLOW*** Cue a bunch of oil platform workers being sent into space in two lame modified STS Orbiters via many scenes of unrealistic common sense - and basic physics - to split an object the size of Texas into two by detonating a nuke ONLY 800 FEET INTO IT.SERIOUSLY - WTF?!?!?! Every single scientific thing in this movie is wrong or made up. The list of scientific horsesh*t is too long to include in this review. However, even if you don't want 7th grade science messing with a good plot, the movie still disappoints. There is a rich stew of cliché and inexplicable character behavior holding it all together. I mean seriously - SPACE DEMENTIA?!?!?!The thing is, every actor seemed to enjoy themselves here, and if it was a standard action movie the individual performances would be acceptable.Tell you what - if you are beneath the age of 8, or have an IQ less than 100, then give it a go.Just remember - In space, EVERYTHING EXPLODES!!!",Armageddon

While Deep Impact struggles to have somewhat more depth than an action movie, it pulls it off horribly.Armageddon, on the other hand, tries to be what it is - an action thriller. Armageddon was much more bearable to watch because you feel no emotional bond with the characters - people die predictably (the plot was predictable enough that I knew somebody, most likely Harry, would sacrifice himself in the end), the dialog is mostly one-liners, and it uses most schlocky action-movie bits - the nuclear bomb is disabled in seconds (and it uses the stupid which-wire to cut trick, even though the guy was a military expert who was supposed to know how the bomb worked) and in one of the final scenes, Harry triggers the bomb with seconds before it is too late.Overall, a good movie to borrow from the library (I wouldn't waste my money on renting) for a few cheap thrills.

We can live with the bad science I suppose, as there is too much of it in movie-land to eradicate (though Armegeddon is rarely topped for scientific stupidity). The main problem is the by the numbers attempt at tear inducing, with all the subtlety of someone grabbing you in a headlock and with each punch to the head yelling ""YOU WILL FEEL SAD!

Of course the cheesiness of America saving the world... again, maybe knocks it down a notch. But at least it was a somewhat feasible scenario. After all, the United States does have the most advanced space program in the world. If anyone was going to do SOMETHING like that, it would be the United States. Anyways, I was very moved by the film. The score and soundtrack is incredible. The performances of the actors involved was very good. Though I know people disagree with me here, I thought the characters were developed well through the script and directing. Of course I don't need to mention that the special effects were a great part of the movie also. It's not a mind expanding movie but it definitely fulfilled my evening and touched me deeply. An added bonus was a few examples of the stupidity of American military mentality!!So blunders of Hollywood's ignorance of scientific and technical knowledge aside, and cheesy as it was, I gave the movie a very deserving 9 out of 10.",Armageddon
819,kylelamm,This is a very poor film,1,25 November 2006,"I realize people enjoy entertainment but this movie goes so far beyond anything that could actually happen that it makes me laugh. Every single scene has the world ending again in some new way. If space missions were done in this manner then we would rename astronauts as cowboys and they would no longer have to be rational, smart, or have any common sense. I call this a comedy because the writing is so bad its funny. So yes watch this movie its a nonstop Michael Bay piece of trash, its popularity reminds me how Bush became president, actually I bet the President likes this movie, i bet he takes notes so he'll know how to handle this kind of situation.

820,zinkeman,Maybe I just don't like Michael Bay,4,6 May 2015,"One can always count on Michael Bay to make the most ridiculous, clichéd, over- the-top movies in any genre he dares tread. This goes over doubly so for his 1998 apocalyptic disaster movie, Armageddon. I am not entirely certain why I find this specific disaster so disaster movie so distasteful. I usually enjoy these types of disaster movies. There is so much fun in speculating on the supposed ""big one"", no matter the type of disaster it is. And there is nothing bigger than a world-destroying asteroid impact. All the pieces fit for a very fun movie, but the execution is done so poorly that it leaves a sour taste in my mouth. First though, let me discuss the things I do like.The effects of the movie are beautiful, it's no wonder it was nominated for an Oscar in that respect. And model for the asteroid, while unrealistic, does go with what the film intended it to be. All the sharp spires and jagged rock and the ominous sounds of it really do a good job of transforming this big inanimate object into an antagonist. Unfortunately, that's all the good I can find in the film.The storytelling itself is bad, the characters are not memorable, and the movie is rife with plot holes. How is it easier to train oil drillers to be astronauts, than astronauts to be oil drillers? What are the chances that every time a smaller asteroid struck, it hit a major city? Why was a romantic subplot shoehorned in, when they could have easily done a great bromance that would make the drillers more memorable?!? A day after re-watching the film and I had to go online to remember whom the drillers other than Bruce Willis were. Also the science of the actual movie is just bad. If NASA did not know about the asteroid 18 days before it hit, they would not know about until it actually hit. Few, if any of the smaller asteroids would make it through the atmosphere without breaking up. And of coarse, an asteroid the size of Texas would do enormous damage to the biosphere, but it would not kill everything and make Earth a lifeless husk. Perhaps a few other scientists other than Billy Bob Thornton should have been consulted.Honestly, I think the only reason I really do not like this movie is because it's a Michael Bay movie. No matter what genre he does, it will always be plenty of shock and awe and effects, and never any story and substance to go with it.",Armageddon

Going to the movies is to escape and enjoy what you are escaping to. Thus Steve Bushemi's comments and Owen Wilson comments were classic and hilarious. Next I read that comment from the guy in Washington. So you think that Con Air is realistic as opposed to Armaggedon? what planet do you live on Pal? Bruce Willis is classic in this movie as Harry Stamper and the ending was such a tear jerker. That is Bruce Willis' style, risk your life for another-there is nothing unrealistic about stuff like that just talk to some of us that were in Nam or Korean/WWII veterans.

Ben Affleck and his old and young friends are forced to come to NASA and go to outer space and destroy the asteroid. They had 18 days before the world gets destroyed. In 12 or 13 days i think they study how to use the space ship and they learn to use things in the space ship and the NASA teams tell them what they have to do in the outer space. They have to destroy that rock. 2 space ships went outerspace. But, unfortunately 1 gets destroyed but some people in it survives.

The acting is so over the top and dialogue so corny that the characters weren't came off as walking statements over real people. Other movies that came out around this time like Dantes peak, Volcano and Deep Impact ranged from bad to mediocre but at least they had a few characters who came off as real people with real lives.

With the operative word being fiction.  It is not supposed to be 100% accurate, nor can it be, because it is talking about things that haven't happened.  Many of the complaints people have had show up just because they are either ignorant of physics, or they just didn't pay attention.  Many of the knocks that people have made about Armageddon could have been made about the Star Wars movies.  The ""factual"" problems with Armageddon get in the way of the movie only if you want them to get in the way.  If you just sit back and watch an entertaining movie you will barely even notice them.About the plot, yes they probably did take a few things too far.  Having the drilling crew be a group of complete losers was a little over the top, and they did fall into some stereotyping of characters, but in general it was fine, because the point was that these guys could drill, even if they couldn't do anything else.  The movie is in no way boring, and even has some areas of originality.  People who complain about the love story should complain just about Liv Tyler's inability to act, because it did add to the plot.Last, nitpickers get over yourselves.  Armageddon was an entertaining movie and that is why it outgrossed the other sci-fi films (and all other films as well) of last summer.

Also, it my my opinion that they couldn't have chosen better actors than Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, and Steve Buscemi... the first three did a wonderful job of making you connect to their characters and Buscemi is always good for a laugh!!!

If you expected more than action and great F/X from this movie than I'v got a revelation for you, you're dumb and stupid. This movie gave you a lot of action and mind-blowing, spectacular and never seen before F/X. Armageddon takes you on a emotional roller coaster ride that has never been attempted, you just have to experience it to beleive it and it even brought tears to my eyes which was totally unexpected to a man like me. The only drawback I have on this movie is the editing, it looks like they deliberately took out 1/2 hour of the movie to satisfy people who will watch 7 hours of t.v. but can't watch a great 3 hour movie, maybe there's a director's cut somewhere.",Armageddon

I honestly don't know how anyone could have given this movie a rating of 10.  It completely sucked!  There were so many inconsistencies I couldn't keep track of them.  The plot was so unbelievable it was laughable.  Liv Tyler's character was so annoying that it made me want to smack the TV.  I really feel bad for Billy Bob Thornton, he was the only even semi-believable character in the whole movie.  I definitely wouldn't want this movie on my resume' if I was him.Everyone keeps talking about how the effects were 'so' cool, I just didn't see it.  Maybe if the same effects were in a decent movie with plot they would have been good.  But in this movie where the story sucked and the acting bad, I was so annoyed that I just couldn't seem to enjoy the special effects.  Maybe if I would of put on some 3-D glasses it would have been more tolerable, but I doubt anything would have helped this movie except shutting off the VCR.By the time this movie was over I had felt like the life had been sucked out of me.  It was horrible.  It was a complete waste of time.  The best piece of advice I can give you on this is to just not watch it and spare yourself the agony.",Armageddon

863,starfury-3,A story pitch made into a movie,1,2 January 1999,"Some folks know a little about how some movies are made; a person or a group of people pitch a story idea to a studio.  This is before a script is completed.  The studio either likes the idea and contracts a script, the idea is changed a bit *then* a script is written, or the idea is scrapped altogether.Alas, Touchstone Pictures didn't go the latter route; instead they did something which is all too common in movies these days: they made a movie using the story pitch and didn't bother spending money on paying someone to write a script.Characterization is utterly non-existent.  ""Armageddon"" seems more like a 140-minute Pepsi commercial.  Nice images of standard Americana and world culture are splashed upon the screen, trying to drag emotions from the unforunate viewer.  But without backstory or an iota of character development, the viewer is left emotionless (unless of course the TV commercial tactic worked).We care little of Affleck and Tyler's ""romance"".  How do we know they are really in love?  Because of an animal cracker?  Bruce Willis' character is wasted as well.  Just who is this guy?  Where did he come from and what does he stand for?  Other than the fact that he is a great oil driller who doesn't like employees sleeping with his daughter, we know nothing of this man.The only interesting character at all is Billy Bob Thorton's ""Dan Truman"". Perhaps interesting is a bit strong; we only seem vauguely attached to his character because he seems to get the most screen time.  He is the most human of the crash test dummies that are wandering around the screen.The special effects, while well done, surely can't save this one.  Another insipid film came to mind when watching ""Armageddon""; ""Independence Day"". We see taxi cabs hurtled into the air (in fact, it seemed as if the meteors were aiming at taxis alone), and New York landmarks destroyed.  But comparing these two dogs of American cinema isn't doing right by ""ID4"". ""Independence Day"" seems like ""Citizen Kane"" compared to the illogical and downright awful ""Armageddon"".The bright side: If there is a sequel to ""Armageddon"" (working title: ""The Rock""...oops, thats taken), it would almost have to be better than the original.",Armageddon

This movie is the definition of ""contrived"".  I have never thought about walking out of a movie while it was running, but I thought long and hard about walking out of this one.  I wish I had, because just the thought of this movie's weak, insipid ending still makes me sick to my stomach.  The only good part of this movie is that you get a chance to laugh at the screenwriter's ""knowledge"" of space and physics.  I especially liked how there was wind on the asteroid, that's classic.  Oh and the space shuttles are good too.  I don't understand why people feel the need to stick up for this movie.  I am not bothered by ""brainless"" movies at all, but this one is just way too much.

It's a British quality I can't abide - that we resent America for enjoying itself, only because we're too shy and reserved to enjoy ourselves as much. Instead of looking down our noses, let's make some of our own unashamedly over the top films. We've certainly got the ability and talent to more than compete. I'm fed up of all the 'Notting Hills'.

Armageddon is no intellectual challenge but it's entertaining and that's what we pay bucks for at the box office, don't we?

They're apparently so far up themselves that they seem entirely to have missed the point that this film knows exactly what it's doing from start to finish. It knows it's corny, it knows it's crazily larger than life, it knows it's out to push all those staple movie buttons, and so it does it all with a terrific sense of humour and, more importantly, on a scale that simply beggars belief but which - crucially - works fantastically. Contrary to what some people say, director Michael Bay does a simply tremendous job of making the whole, massive juggernaut of a movie bolt along at a terrific pace, and even more remarkably, manages to engage your emotions even while you're laughing your head off at all the hokum. Other people complain about the characters, but I struggle to recall a movie that crammed so many memorable - if, naturally, larger than life - people into a single movie. Basically this film is pure cinema. Sure, it's not an Ingmar Bergman film, but it never wants to be one. And if, as anyone with half a brain cell should see, you judge it in terms of what it does want to be, you will see that it succeeds quite magnificently. Sorry to get a bit personal with this review, but as a person who enjoys movies of all sorts, I just couldn't stand by and let arrogant fools diss a top movie for no other reason than it doesn't stay true to the 'laws of science' (sheesh, get a life guys!) and doesn't want to fit into only the small category of 'coolness' they're pseudo intellectuality permits them to admit to enjoying.

881,internut-6,"Suspending disbelief is one thing, suspending common sense is another",3,4 January 2005,"This film contains some of the most dreadful physics that I've ever seen. They spin the space station Mir with the shuttle docked to it to create gravity. Perhaps this was done to save the producers the cost of renting the 'vomit comet' to film the zero-g sequences as was done in Apollo 13. However, not only would the docked shuttle tear itself from it's moorings in reality, but the station is shown rotating on it's axis where in one scene, an actor was climbing a ladder and there was gravity there! So they cheesed out on the effects and still didn't get it right! My other beef with this movie is the plot device where you the viewer are told that something must happen in X amount of time, and then of course you get down to the last possible second before the thing happens. This movie overused this plot device worse than I've ever seen. I can take it in every other Star Trek episode, but in Armageddon, the first time it was exciting, the second time it was OK, by the third time I was checking my watch and figuring out if I could hit the popcorn stand and be back before Bruce saved the day.",Armageddon

883,h-son,This movie redefined my reviewing scale,1,11 January 2001,"I was in a discussion about movies and 'Armageddon' came up. As usual, I went to IMDB (no kiss-ass, I actually use this site). Imagine my horror when I found one of my countrymen, said ""Probably the best movie I've seen yet"". I had to read it twice. Then I had to read the rest, to see if it was sarcastic.I've seen a lot of movies. Some good, many bad. Many, many bad movies. But only once in my lifetime I've yet had the feeling after leaving the theatre that ""now I have to redefine my whole reviewing scale for movies"". 'Armageddon' was that movie. It defies words, but I'll try. It is SO incredibly BAD it's amazing it ever got made. No, strike that; it was obviously made to make money, by people who didn't care about making movies.It had actors. Some I like, some I don't. That's not the point. All the actors seemed to do parodies of characters they've played in other movies - even Steve Buscemi's character was outright bad, and he's usually one to be trusted to save a less-than-perfect movie. Bruce Willis was simply a parody. I hope he got paid lots. One of my countrymen, Peter Stormare, played (as usual) a russian, and even though it's usually heart warming to see him in small roles in major movies this was just plain embarrassing. I won't go into the whole Affleck-Tyler thingy, that was just bad beyond words.It had explosions. Every big movie these days has great FX, so it's pretty useless going into details. Let's just call it ""expensive action sequences"".It had a script. It must have been written on a box of matches, in a very large typeface. If it was written down at all. Maybe they just made it up as they went along; at least that would explain things.It had humour. It had some terribly embarrassing one-liners that I assume were supposed to be funny, but that's not what I'm talking about. The entire movie in itself was just a collection of cliche parodies.It had an ending. Thank GOD it had an ending, although at times it certainly seemed to be too far away.That said, it at least has one redeeming quality: lots of people have seen it, so when I refer to it (""the new movie so-and-so is very very bad, but still THIS much better than 'Armageddon') people will understand what I'm talking about.

The love scenes are paltry, as is really, the whole movie. But still the love scenes stand out as especially vapid. Willis is alright, but he still cannot pull off that sentimental scene with Liv where they cry. I guess seeing this movie in the theatres was like this: I could not get into the story because it was bombarding me with noises and assaulting me with flashing images.

It seemed, at the time, to be one of the most important, awe-inspiring cinematic experiences of our generation. At once riveting, action-packed, funny, heartbreaking, and truly inspirational, Armegeddeon really did have everything going on, right down to the catchy Aerosmith theme song and sappy tear-jerker of an ending.Sweet Jebus. What were we smoking? I watched it for the first time in years last night on one of the movie channels, and... I cannot even describe it. This is, truly, one of the worst movies ever made. Where to even begin? Leaving aside the plethora of LAUGHABLE scientific errors ('personnel trackers' on astronauts? yeah, sure, thanks for that, Billy Bob), I'd have to say the worst thing about it was the remarkable - dare I even say unmatched - way in which it combined crappy writing with crappy acting. There are too many examples of this to even begin listing here, but one in particular springs to mind - the scene where Bruce Willis is telling the Feds exactly where to go to track down each of the oh-so-charmingly-roguish members of his oil drilling team ('check every bar in New Orleans', 'the craps tables in Vegas', 'the only black guy on a motorcycle in Sturgis'... all to the tune of 'Come Together'... it reminded me a bit of the ""NEWS TEAM! ASSEMBLE!"" scene from Anchorman, except serious). Ben Affleck proves, once again, that he is by far the most overpaid actor in Hollywood, having less depth, range, and overall talent than anyone else in the business. Not that Bruce Willis, Liv Tyler, OR ANYONE ELSE IN THIS GODFORSAKEN PIECE OF GARBAGE was much better.(I have to say, though, I got a kick out of seeing a pre-stardom Owen Wilson get killed off half-way through... is this the only movie where his character dies?) Peter Stormare is perfect as THE MOST STEREOTYPICAL UNSHAVEN Russian COSMONAUT YOU HAVE EVER SCENE. (Then again, Peter Stormare does seem to have a talent for playing over-the-top Eurotypes.) It really was quite amusing how, almost IMMEDIATELY after the Americans dock with the Russian Space Station (which is actually called that in the movie), Ben Affleck succeeds in singlehandedly causing the whole joint to explode in spectacular Hollywood fashion. I also love the fact that, in the end, Paris is the only place on Earth to get destroyed, and that absolutely no one seems to care. And on top of all that, it at points literally turns into simultaneous ads for Lockheed Martin AND Kerr McGee. Oh how proud I am to be an American.There's plenty of other stuff to rant about, but I won't... suffice it to say that this is a really, really, REALLY terrible movie, that I feel ashamed to have ever genuinely liked.I give it two stars just for the mockability factor.",Armageddon

So I have all reasons to love this movie considering the fact that it contents all my favourite content! Michael Bay, you have really touched my heart and soul with Armageddon.... Thanks!",Armageddon
892,RianTurran,What are you all crying about?,10,30 June 2001,"I've seen this movie over and over and I think that it was a great film. Is the plot believeable? Of course not! Is that why you watch movies? Because they make you believe? Because they ""inspire"" you? Please! I loved the humor of the movie and how it pokes fun at the hierarchy of our society. As far as plot is concerned, did anyone watch the movie? Did anyone else realize that the whole plot, although cliched, was to save the world from destruction? It was a MOVIE!!! Not a freaking science journal or history manual. Movies take us on a ride, which is what ""Armageddon"" did. The events would never happen, but that's what I like about it. It's FICTION!!! And I LOVE IT!!!",Armageddon
893,mandy181,The best movie ever,10,15 July 2006,"I have to disagree with anyone who has anything bad to say about Armageddon. It is the best movie for a girly night in and also for a nice night in with your partner. I first saw it in the cinema nearly eight years ago and its still my favourite movie. Its just such a warm hearted family movie and you can imagine yourself caught up in the situation, it sucks you right in and has you believing every word Harry Stamper tells his daughter Grace. The ending is so outrageous but so believable you'd have to be stone hearted not to shed a tear. After nearly eight years of loving this movie i still get emotional when Harry stops AJ giving up his life so AJ and Grace can live happily ever after. Apart from the movie being fantastic the song to go with it is just amazing and I'm proud to say it will be the first dance at my wedding with the guy i went to see Armageddon with all that time ago.",Armageddon
894,Dougierobb,absolutely awful.,1,28 April 2001,"This film is one of the worst i have ever seen, it's badly scripted, full of cliches,over the top and very very dull. Bruce Willis cannot act, that is fact, the only decent films he has been in are pulp fiction and 12 monkeys. It just makes me angry when people make these films and some movie goers just lap them up. The only light relief from the onslaught of rubbishness was when they sang 'leaving on a jet plane'. Avoid at all costs.",Armageddon
895,peaches-k,5.8!!!! how can you give this movie only 5.8!,10,4 May 2001,"first of all i dont see how people can honestly think that this movie is worth such a low score. I mean it might not be believable but was ET believable. I think that a good movie is one that sweeps you up in it. A movie that you can see and it is like you are there with them. Like you are feeling what the character is feeling and like you looking in on your life. A good movie is one when you forget you in a movie theatre and and you forget you are sitting in uncomfortable seat all that you are aware of is that a character is going through a stressful, happy, painful or confusing time in there life and you are right there going through it with them. And i dont know how many of you reading this have seen armageddon but it is my greatest movie of all time. Not because of the actors, not because a certain person directed or produced it. It because it is a movie you can lose yourself in. It is a movie where you forget where you are , where you dont care any more if people see you laugh or cry where you just want to reach out and hold liv when she is crying or when you yell to bruce to save ben. No matter what anyone says armageddon is the best movie ever because it can capture you and take you to a world were you never imagined you would ever be!",Armageddon

899,ireallyhopeithurts,A review of Armageddon by me. shocking really.,7,28 August 2006,"OK, I'm the first to admit it, I'm a bit of a film snob. The thought of big budget US movies with so many famous names that they can't all fit on the DVD box makes me want to run away and hide. In a box with no holes. Underground. But on holiday in Scotland with nothing else to do on a Tuesday night, i opted to watch Armageddon rather than listen to my dad give us the potted history of The Isle of Mull, thinking i could at least laugh at the bad acting and melodrama. The opening scenes didn't disappoint, they were suitably badly acted and melodramatic, and as i didn't check the credits, i hadn't realised that i had opted in for Liv Tylers weird ass body shape and crappy airy-fairy voice. Introducing her as the 'smart' daughter seemed too incredulous even for Hollywood. But i'm rambling; although the plot was implausible, when Bruce Willis our big Captain America calls in the help of his oddball team in the forms of Steve Buscemi, Owen Wilson, and t'others, i was in stitches right up until Liv Tyler had to share a scene with Ben Affleck. Steve Buscemi's performance was priceless, even when playing sleazy weirdo's he's got this amazing comic touch and an ability to make you care about his fate. If he had died I would have stopped watching. Maybe. I was actually quite surprised he didn't, i swear he always dies in films. I felt a bit sorry for Owen Wilson too, he didn't get enough screen time, even if he does have the weirdest nose ever, and I was genuinely surprised that they didn't sweep back and pull Bruce Willis from the brink of death, doom and destruction, in true Hollywood style. But ah well, I didn't exactly miss him.The angst scenes with Liv Tyler were unnecessary. As were the love scenes between her and Ben Affleck. In fact, her entire performance was unnecessary, i reckon they only cast her cos tehy needed a chick. Come of think of it, if they wanted a chick in the movie they should have put one on the mission. Bruce Willis was watchable, he's not a great actor but he knows what he's good at and sticks to it, and I like some of the films he's been in (Army of the 12 monkeys, 5th element) and Ben Affleck was so inoffensive i forgot he was there for most of the film. Oh yeah, i just remembered there was a chick on the mission, i forgot her too.Anyway, onto the bulk of the film, where they drill holes in an Asteroid and nuke it, I thought this was formulaic, but tense all the same. Probably because i'm paranoid about the end of the world. The special effects i thought actually added to the drama, which is odd because I could usually do without them. The great part about this was that it wasn't even taken too seriously, Steve Buscemi's space dementia picked me up at times where i felt any more layers of tense situation would make me explode. some of his one-liners, if not particularly original, were delivered expertly and with just the right amount of laughter at himself. I love Steve Buscemi, I really do. I want him to rule the world. And that pseudo Russian guy who didn't sound Russian (I dated a Russian bloke OK, I know what tehy sound like) he was funny too. I've forgotten his name but he's been in some good films. So anyway, they save the world, everyone (including me) is very relieved, Steve Buscemi makes it back to earth (i'm even more relieved) and the film ends. It was good, I felt satisfied with it. If I'd seen it in the cinema I would have felt that i'd had enough thrills and laughs for my money. And Steve Buscemi! ^___________^Maybe i'm a little biased. I have a soft spot for overly-long films, and films about the end of the world (because i'm paranoid about it), but anyhow, apart from King Kong (which i loved, also overly long!) I'd say this is my favourite Hollywood Blockbuster; it was tense, injected humour and sorrow in similar amounts, it was professionally done and very slick, which isn't necessarily a bad thing. I found myself actually fearing the end of the world, even though i knew it wasn't going to happen, and... come on, Steve Buscemi! I love him!Oh my Gosh I'm a freak! I just wrote 750 words on Armageddon! Make that 766.",Armageddon
900,quagga,Unbelievably stupid,1,11 February 2004,"This is one great insult of the viewers' intelligence. While the special effects are amazing the film has no story, almost no believable characters and just about every technical detail is wrong! The laws of nature are suspended so that the thing is like an alternate-universe fantasy movie - yet set in the USA. And yes, the unbearable US nationalism that permeates the film makes audiences all over the world groan.

All in all a great film that everyone needs to see.",Armageddon
902,Satnav,"Unrealistic and ludicrous, but still enjoyable.",5,23 September 2006,"Firstly, this is not as bad as some people are saying. I'll admit: it's almost 99% scientific flaws, the final part was so cheesy that I was just laughing, and the directing is confusing, with loads of random explosions and people yelling. But, if you're willing to suspend your disbelief and try not to become too engrossed with the glaringly obvious scientific flaws, this can be quite enjoyable.But this is nowhere near as good as some say. This does NOT deserve anything above a 6 or 7 out of 10. I just can't believe some people think this is the best movie ever. Okay, there are countless other movies that are far worse, but there are countless others that are far better. I just burst out laughing when the supposedly intelligent director of NASA decides to send a bunch of incompetent oil drillers into space. If the movie was a parody than this would be understandable, but this was advertised as a serious end-of-the-world drama. Explosions are inserted at every opportunity, and the plot holes are overwhelming in number, as are cloying Americanisms. The scientific flaws are just so glaringly obvious that you can't help but notice them. I know films like this are not renowned for scientific accuracy, but this is a film that demands scientific accuracy. It's just a Hollywood blockbuster, some cry. Yeah, but you can't help but laugh when suddenly a rock storm occurs for NO REASON other than to kill off a few cast members, and in the most predictable manner meteorites don't just land anywhere, they land in New York. And when they hit New York, they don't just hit any place in New York, they hit the Chrysler Building, Grand Central Terminal, the WTC... But despite all these innumerable flaws, despite the laughable sequences, despite the cheesy melodramatic typical Hollywood ending, there is still an enjoyable film to be found. If you can ignore the scientific errors, plot holes, and other mountains of flaws, then this can be quite a fun ride.",Armageddon
903,newmancan,I was rooting for the asteroid.,1,2 July 2001,"Dollar for dollar I think this is one of the worst movies to come out in a long time. Each line of dialogue from Bruce Willis' character is more macho then the last. Each problem the space crew runs into is supposed to create tension and after a certain point, it created laughter in the audience I saw the movie with. The beautiful cut away shots of the events on earth kept popping up and it reminded me more of a Visa commercial than a plot device. There's a lot of characters in this movie that really don't seem to have a whole lot to do,including Steve Buscemi, which is unfortunate. Bruckheimer films aren't surprising they follow a well known formula and I have to say I've seen most of his films. Armageddon was the first one I almost walked out on. I have yet to go see Pearl Harbor because I still haven't recovered from this one.",Armageddon

The movie manages to be both lighthearted and serious in varying and true cinematic measure. Liv Tyler plays her scenes in a way few are able to on screen.

The love-connection (Affleck-Tyler) is soppy and dripping with superfluous romance. The special effects are not that special anymore, if you see that it is nearly all done in1-5 seconds cuts. So the rating must be 1 out of 10! What saved it though was, that I watched it with my six-year old son and he REALLY enjoyed it. It also gives me a perfect chance to explain him a bit about the law of physics. So I gave it 5 out of 10 :).

908,angsttaler,emotional,10,5 December 2006,"It made me laugh and it made me cry! A high charged emotional film that I love! I don't feel it is another Independence Day in the least. Its more emotional then Independence Day is. Independence Day had more fiction then Armageddon. There is every chance that we may come up against a big asteroid the size of Texas etc that could kill off man kind - well more of a chance then little green men taking over Earth like in Independence Day. Most movies ARE fiction so what can you really expect? Maybe there was also hidden meaning behind things in the movies such as sending up a bunch oil drillers, some being on the wrong side of the law to one being a total horn bag that hangs in strip bars opposed to sending up a team of highly trained astronauts. Maybe that was to point out that you don't have to be a person who has ""school smarts"" or rich or famous to help this country, this world. Just be able to do what you do the best you can do! Some of the characters in the film just get you laughing so hard while there are times when you feel that lump rise up in your throat and feel your eyes start to water. You just have to love Steve Buscemi's character in the movie, he cracks me up through the whole movie. We all know there are chick flicks etc and I think maybe this is a sci-fi chick flick. Men didn't find it that great as they wanted the blood, guts and glory kind of film. But for women such as myself it was one of THE most touching movies of the time!",Armageddon

I had to create an account JUST for this film.See, I was bored, it's lockdown, and I had hammered all my streaming services on a weekend.So I watched Armageddon. Wow. Was not what I expected. It was better.It's stoked full of cliches, pastiches, and just paint by numbers all American action adventure. It has them all, all the stereotypes you can imagine, and then some. They just don't make this stuff anymore.Sure, it's got plot holes the size of the asteroid. The Science is laughable. The script predictable. The acting melodramatic. But it's just great. All of it. It's like the perfect antidote the current movies being spewed out of Hollywood, where they are all about the current political narrative and are trying to push society to their ideology.This is fisher price action movie stuff. There is a little 5 year old me, that having spent a day at kindergarten, just wanted to watch stuff exploded, space ships, drillers, and machines. And this had it all, in spades. I don't want to be lectured, Scooby Doo was enough moralising for me. And at least they had the good decency to leave it until the last few minutes. This is pure Scooby Doo, all the way to the end.Hollywood take note!! Sometimes I want to be taken away from reality, not forced to face some sins that aren't even mine!! I just want explosions, and stuff!!And the 50 year old me, well, he absolutely loves this. At one point I burst out laughing, belly busting laughter. It wasn't even a point where I should be laughing. And the best part. If I was in a Cinema watching this, I would have laughed there as well!! Best part is, the cinema would try their hardest not to laugh along with me as well. I know this. It would make me even more creased with mirth knowing they are trying to keep it in as well.It's so over the top. It's so outrageously unabashed gung ho cinema. One thing you can't say about this film, it's not boring. And it may just surprise you.Look, if you want moralising high brow films, there are plenty out there, a good number made a long time ago, that are much more poignant and subtle and pleasant than what's being produced now. But if you want action adventure, unashamed action adventure that wouldn't ever be made in the current climate, then this is for you.As sometimes, we just need taking out of real for a moment.

Saving the planet is depicted as a group effort and not left up to one superhero.The photography is breathtaking, the soundtrack is unbelievably fine, and there couldn't have been a better cast chosen. Also, Bruce Willis sold his performance as Harry Stamper in a split second during a scene in which he crosses the deck of the oil rig, talking a mile and minute but reaches out to help an employee move a piece of heavy equipment, never breaking stride or losing his conversational pace.

This movie smells from far as being a high-quality one. Special effects, well, they are astounding, nothing else to say. And Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck are really amazing, also the other guys have done a great job. What a hell, maybe this is what makes this movie so good, the performance of all the actors, not just those two. And I see here one guy that tells this is a ""popcorn movie"". Unbelievable. What's a good movie for guys like him, Saw, Borat, Harry Potter, etc? But this is a fact, people, in general, do not appreciate good quality movies or music, nor the guys in the Oscar committee.

Seriously? How can you honestly say that this movie was horrible? The acting wasn't completely amazing but, this isn't an Oscar winning movie over here! It's just a movie! It still shocks me to see people have expectations of a movie before they see it. How will you ever enjoy a movie if you are constantly having high expectations of it? Can't people just sit back and enjoy it? I really like this movie despite all of its bad reviews because unlike some people who actually let these reviews take over their own opinions, I like to just watch it and see what happens. personally, I think it is one of the better movies of the 90s. this movie has everything! its an action/drama/romantic/sci-fi/comedy movie for goodness sake! for those of you who said that the movie is completely over the top and unrealistic, then maybe you should look up this term: SCI-FI!!! that means ""Science FICTION"". okay, boys and girls? FICTON means NOT REAL!!! Come on people! please tell me if someone hasn't cried when Bruce Willis told his daughter that he has to break his promise...he's not coming back home. I NEVER cry during movies and this is the only movie that actually brought me to tears. But don't think i'm a daddy's girl because that's far from the point. for those of you who love your fathers or even lost them at some point in your life, then this movie will definitely break your heart especially when he says that he wishes that he could walk her down the aisle...but he can't. the guy dies trying to save the world!!! god forbid if an asteroid hits this earth, we'd all be screwed due to these pretty pathetic viewers. why don't you try risking your life by trying to save humanity and then tell me you're not a hero. anyways, Steve Buscemi just made me fall off my chair laughing and the movie is just amazing. The action is great, story line is great, and even the over the top science facts are incredible. these people seriously have an awesome imagination and everyone who said this movie is bad...well...then you guys just have a crappy sense of humor, no heart what so ever, and you guys are just pathetically boring. this movie is really sad and I loved it...I think i'm gonna go watch it right now.",Armageddon

The actors in it shouldn't have been training to be astronauts, they should have been training to be actors. Even Bruce Willis is awful.

918,QuantumEleven,Superficial and just WRONG - but amusing nonetheless,6,23 December 2002,"Armageddon - it's not a new concept. As you may have gathered from the trailer,SPOILER WARNINGa big asteroid (or comet, they never seem to be able to make up their minds) is heading for Earth, and the only plan that anyone seems to be able to come up with is to send a bunch of oil drillers to drill a hole on this asteroid, drop a nuclear weapon down it, and thus blow it up and save Earth.END SPOILER WARNINGIs the plot predictable? Oh yes. Is it original? No. Would is work in real life? Over my dead body it would.Add to that a double overdose of American patriotism, some spotty acting, and you might think you have a big flop on your hands. Which, in a way, you do - but what viewers have to realise is that film is only worth watching if you're willing not to take it seriously, if you're willing to suspend belief for a minute. If you can do that, the film becomes quite entertaining - just don't start looking for seriousness. Quite a bit of the film is (I would say, anyway...) intended to be tongue-in-cheek, I found myself laughing out loud at many, many scenes in the film (especially at some of the to-die(-for) one-liners that the characters seem to sprout at regular intervals.So: See this film as pure no-brain entertainment. About as deep as a puddle and about as suble as the wrench that Bear holds the first time we see him on the oil rig. But still, in my opinion, entertaining. A light two hours, but steer well clear if you're looking for either real drama, realism (scientific pedants be warned!), real characters, or a real story.",Armageddon

I am a very easy guy when it comes to movies. I take them for what they are, and rarely think they are lame.I rarely see movies I don't like - specially not Hollywood blockbusters like Armageddon. Armageddon even features Bruce Willis, Steve Buscemi and Ben Affleck - three actors that I really like.I don't want to spoil the movies intricate plot (note the heavy use of sarcasm) by disclosing what happens in those crucial scenes where the bomb is counting down towards zero, or the guy has fallen down the deep trench. But I don't have to - it's EXACTLY what you will expect to happen. The only element of surprise would be that you keep thinking ""no way... it can't be THAT lame"", and then it proves you wrong.This movie is not only cliché ridden - there are also several things in the movie that suddenly happen for no apparent reason. Like Steve Buscemis character going space-crazy, as if only to tell you that ""in space it doesn't matter if you are intelligent enough to solve a rubiks cube"".On the positive side, the special effects are of course awesome, and the cinematography is good (regular good, not out of the ordinary).

Peter Stormare as the Cosmonaut is damn funny, and many of the actors all add something. Bruce Willis hits a chord with me as a Father, as I was in poor health and possibly leaving my only daughter. Willis had me laughing at the beginning when he tried to shoot Ben Affleck and then I was in tears as he said goodbye to his daughter. Is it 2001 A Space Odyssey, no it is not (but then I think that is highly over-rated) and am I a pretentious critic? No - I will watch a film on its merits and judge it for that.

I do realize that it did not scientifically do justice for those looking for that. But if your looking for a film that is a hundred percent accurate then rent a documentary.I was impressed by the films depth the CGI also wasn't that bad. When you can destroy all of New York, Paris, and China and still make it look good then your doing something right. I would recommend this movie for everyone that enjoys great films. Go out and buy this movie today it's totally worth it.",Armageddon
925,ralger-2,Must have for any movie collection,9,20 November 2007,"While blending action and comedy maybe a known recipe for success, how about action, comedy, and the end of the world? After seeing the movie Armageddon I now know that such a combination is not only possible but in this case a recipe for an extremely entertaining movie. Michel Bay also known for such movies as Bad Boys and The Rock, manages to pull together all the critical elements necessary for a good film in Armageddon. The all star cast includes Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck, and Liv Tyler just to name a few. To add to the great cast are good special effects (including a meteor shower in downtown New York) and a rocking musical score including bands such as Aerosmith, Bon Jovi, and ZZ Top.The basic premise of the plot is that a giant asteroid is detected on a collision course with earth. After NASA studies the asteroid they determine that the only way to destroy it is with a nuclear warhead placed precisely on a fault line in the middle of it. The next step they take is to call in some of the world's best deep core oil drillers (led by Bruce Willis) and give them the task of drilling an 800 foot hole on the asteroid in which to place the bomb. Over the course of their endeavor this ragtag group must overcome a variety of challenges with the fate of the world hanging in the balance.Despite the serious subject matter Mr. Bay manages to integrate a great deal of comic relief without going over the top (More like Bad Boys than Rush Hour). It is this fine tuned balance in which humor and action blend that makes this movie great. An example of some of the humor can be found in the following quote:When the asteroid is first discovered by an astronomer he calls it into NASA while his wife sits next to him:NASA Director (Billy Bob Thornton): Now listen Karl, this is top secret. Astronomer: Sir, I'm retired navy, I know all about classified. But one more thing. The person who finds her gets to name her right? NASA Director (Billy Bob Thornton): Yes, yes that's right, that's right. Astronomer: I wanna name her Dottie after my wife. She's a vicious life-sucking bitch from which there is no escape.Aside from the action and humor this movie manages to turn one of the characters into a hero and by the end you find yourself rooting for him. Don't worry about the fact that this is a Sci-Fi movie, it doesn't slow you down with technobabble and there are no life sucking aliens. As far as plot goes this movie may not be some great work of art, however the plot progresses in good fashion. While for the first time viewer the occasional minor twist livens up the movie, the plot as a whole is good enough so that it does not rely entirely on suspense or shock value (No M. Night Shyamalan here). Simply put, this movie has a high re-watch-ability value shifting it from the rent  for  a  night to the buy  for  your  collection category.",Armageddon

I'd say, it's undoubtedly one of the most touching movies around. You watch it till the end, you'll really get what I mean. Plus, most of the people I know literally memorize the lyrics to ""I Don't Wanna Miss A Thing"" which is a soundtrack from this movie. I'd say, even that counts for something. Good visuals. Characters are all very unique in a way. Lots of love involved. The story of the movie is really very very touching. I can literally recall scenes from this movie.

928,lokerd,One of the best movies ever!,10,1 May 2009,"I have watched this movie 20-30 times...as I watch this movie each year about 4-5 times showing it to my students (dead days when half the class is gone anyway...like today). Now 11 years old, each year I reminded at what a good movie this.I realize there are a lot of critics of this movie and that there are challenges with the movie, but in all fairness, this movie has just about everything a good movie should have. I mean, unless you are wanting to watch a non-fiction movie, then this is the perfect fiction story. First the movie starts with action. There are so many movies today that are good...but just never get that WHAMO start that Armageddon starts with. The movie has tons of humor, so many lines that are just down right funny that this could almost be called a comedy. I have seen comedy movies that aren't as funny as Armageddon. It has romance...a real love story. The presidential montage with the incredible music score raking you across a range of motions from a father who messed up, to a dying father to a father saying good bye to his little girl, is just down right brilliant (brings tears to my eyes just writing this...and every time while watching it).The tension building from get go is what makes this movie and the middle 10 minutes probably the most dramatic movie ever. The movie reminds me of how fragile life is...and how fragile our existence on this planet is, really. I think the message that the president reads is very well written and very dramatic.I think the acting is really well done. The all star cast is perfect. Bruce Willis is flawless. Billy Bob is great. Keith David (Kimsey) is hysterical. The suspense...although you guess how the movie is going to end before it begins, is enough to keep you glued to your seat. The cinematography is incredible with great lighting, composition, filming, scenery, shallow depth of film, etc. The pacing is also very well done with very few slow spots.So, sure you can poke holes in lots of technical details, but Armageddon is perfectly entertaining...and based on just about every other movie I have ever seen (and I watch a ton of movies and shows) is the best all around movie ever.",Armageddon
929,jariscojr,mentions another movie which has same plot in my opinion,5,22 April 2012,"This picture has the plot line of ""The Green Slime"" (1969) absent the slime. Check out the original and see. In addition to Robert Horton (who knows who this is?), and Richard Jaeckel (the sergeant in the ""Dirty Dozen""), it has Luciana Paluzzi (the lollapalooza from ""Thunderball"") - be still, my beating heart!! You have the asteroid, the collision course with Earth, the NASA references, and the explosives planted directly by space ship landing to obliterate it. Admittedly, slime is a pretty big element to omit and still consider it the same. The tension between the two male characters is there; however, in ""Armageddon"", it is because the Bruce Willis doesn't trust Ben Affleck with his daughter, Liv Tyler. The original plot has the two men as rivals for the woman. Special effects have grown exponentially in almost 30 years. All the space ship scenes are models (way cool; I would have loved to have them as toys 40 years ago). The slime is pretty much soap bubbles with food coloring, and inflatable rubber with lights inside. The monster, however, wouldn't even have made it in the TV show ""Lost in Space""!",Armageddon

I hate when they spent millions of dollars in incredible FX but they forgot to take care about the details. One example: there is no sounds in space, everybody knows it, and if they have to use this strange boots because of the lack of gravity, why the bars they are throwing from the truck fall down on the asteroid like on earth and make noise when hit each other?.

Well, me.  This is may be the most idiotic movie of all time.  Typically, i only review movies i liked, but this one was so insulting I had to say something.  I've read so many posts from those who somehow enjoyed this movie, and who essentially said in their posts that the special effects were wonderful, viewers should sit back, stop thinking, and just enjoy the movie, etc.  Well I like to think when i watch a film.  I love special effects, but the fact is that anyone with a budget can produce great special effects in this day and age. Special effects in and of themselves don't make a movie great.  Of course there have been a number of great movies with mind blowing special effects, such as T2 and The Matrix.  Really interesting plots, at least decent acting, and yes, good special effects.  Armageddon was all bang with no substance, and it represents the sad mentality in much of Hollywood - make money, sacrifice artistic integrity.The GmanP.S. To Ben Afleck - Man, you have sunk low.

They love it for exactly the same reasons, pure entertainment value.Some background for those that haven't watched Idiocracy, the blockbuster movie of the future was aptly called ""Ass"". It was entire movie devoted to someone's ass farting repeatedly. The crowds loved it. Armageddon is ahead of it's time as a noisy piece of flatulence that came out of a rear end. I don't want to waste time being redundant, go read all the bad reviews here for spot on commentaries of the reasons why.If you're the kind of movie lover that would appreciate a movie like ""Ass"", I highly recommend this to you. Otherwise, save your time and money and avoid the high risk of developing brain-rot akin to licking lead paint.There have technically been worse movies created, but none with the staggering budget of this. $200M could have been spent in so many more useful or more entertaining ways which is why this gets my vote for worst. movie. ever.",Armageddon

936,akermann6,What an absolute disgrace and insult to people,1,3 July 2009,"First of all. I do not look down on Americans. I know lots of people that are intelligent people from the USA. But this Movie is so utterly bad, that i just had to comment on it.First of all...Movies are mostly far from the truth. This movie is no exception. Lots of scene's are so incredibly false. For example the departure of the 2 space ships. You see them drop off the full tanks in space. Just a small distance from each other. Remember what caused the space shuttle to explode in the past ? Just a tinsy winsy part that came off. In here it is just common to drop fuel tanks that are as big if not bigger then the whole ship. What idiot would let 2 spaceships lift up and do that at the same time ??? Second of it is that the Russian station is a piece of (s)crap. I hate to bring this up to you, but astronauts nowadays go to Russia. Since their equipment is much more reliable then NASA's. The Space Shuttle is retired. And NASA uses it just to pay off the bills. And there is no better alternative for it. And the list of whoppers goes on and on. This is truly an insult to people that do take space travel serious. And i know half as much as these guys do. But the most annoying part ( read: the whole movie ) is the Propaganda and patriot crap that u get choked with. MY GOD !!!! I thought i was looking at a CNN business commercial for like an hour. The actors solve their petty problems by shooting at each other, giving the middle finger to everyone they come face to face with, start up fights, ignore the police, etc, etc... But when it comes to their love for their country and sacrificing their lives, suddenly everyone stands in line to commit suicide for it ( bomb detonator ) ?? Maybe i lack the feeling of being a true ""Patriot"", that can sing the national anthem backwards in Swahili. Whilst riding with George Bush behind the steering wheel of a golf cart, driving in circles until the battery is empty. But this movie was too much for me too handle. And when i finally got hold and pulled the flag pole and fabric of the American flag out of my hiney. I realised that i was glad this movie was finally done. I do not know why so much good actors participated in this narrow minded, stereotyping, propaganda movie. But i pity them. This represents a country where you can get away with murder if you have money or power. As long as ""Uncle Sam"" thinks you are a good patriot. Where everyone is happy as long as it is another country that has been devastated, no one cares.",Armageddon

The digital effects are - in retrospect - not that bad. And the irony and humour is great - the underlying feel of this movie is that we are all human, we all make mistakes, but we have to make it together - or not make it at all.

So, at the end, when you're supposed to be putting your fist up in the air saying ""yeah!,"" you're having a let down because Bruce Willis is walking off to his death, essentially. I would have preferred an ending in the ""Bruce Willis Style"".... you know, he and his crew DO come back, and he gets back to NASA to deck the guy responsible for not allowing him to finish the mission he was told the crew was hired for... even if it HAD to be the President of the United States! I really felt like this would have been a ""9"" movie if not for the killing of the main hero. But this movie took my emotions and built them up, up, up, and then right before the end, they changed the ""excitement"" I was feeling into a huge sorrow... and that's not the way I wanted to feel at the end of this exciting movie with characters I grew fond of.

945,shengxiaoshulong,It is the spirit of frontier heritage,8,23 November 2011,"As an international student who have came there for 3 month, I find something that in American blood. No matter how many bugs in this film, it can show the spirit of American from many fields.It mainly talks about the progress of a group of drilling workers saving the world by drilling a failing stone and exploding it. At the beginning, I notice that all of them wear jeans which have been the mark of American, like the hat of cowboy. The job may be dangerous because of storm ,but they love challenge.Self-reliance is another part I see from American. They tear down the drill cars that take NASA millions of dollar and then rebuild them the way they like. That is one of the reasons they overcome the bad situation in the end. Self-reliance may be the reason why there is no other country join the saving plan except a drunk Russian. Just like a hundred years ago, rugged individualists, like Daniel Boone, Jesse James and Wyatt Earp ,and many other people tried to conquer ""the Wild West"" by themselves.From the start to finish, president to soldiers, no one ever thought about what will happen if they don't win. All I see is ""I can do it! "" ""We can get it!"" ""God bless America"". ""Can-Do"" is the power that change impossible to possible.The most impression of America that I get from the film is equality. In front of risk, we are equal to each other. No matter what's your job, you may be the hero to save the world because those drilling guys did it. This just like a copy of history, people change, equipments change but the spirit will never change. God bless American.",Armageddon
946,bluejamie,Badly written and offensive,2,25 August 2006,"I saw this film last night.And I'm worried I'm turning into one of those left-wing liberals they rightly make fun of in South Park. Because I found it hugely offensive. Am I being ridiculously sensitive? Firstly, there's the old staple that is America being the only country in the world that is physically capable of anything, ever.Secondly, and chillingly, there is the early meteor strike hitting some (unnamed  why do they need a name?) Asian country. The reaction to this is to look at it as a warning. As in ""my god, imagine the tragedy that *could* happen"". Because, you know, it happened to Asians. It might happen to white Americans, and *that* would be tragic.Then, later on, a bigger meteor hits Paris. Our cast on the ground are irritated, because this might mean our boys have less time than they thought. Not much upset in America. No mention that a lot of people have died.Then there's Michael Clarke Duncan. A wonderful actor, wasted. Never has a black man been so token. Among a team of hardcore drillers, his job seems to consist of standing in the back, occasionally saying ""Hey, you da man."" Really. Why did they even bring him? It's not like he's petite - he weighed down that shuttle for nothing! Not once does he lift a tool, steer a space ship or even help fix anything that blows up.Even if you ignore the Russian Cosmonaut (Peter Stormare, another great actor wasted in a pointless role), who seems drunk most of the time and hits things with spanners instead of fixing them because ""Dat's how we do dese dings in Russia"", it's pretty horrific.All cemented of course by the site of blond, blue-eyed American children all celebrating in corn fields at being saved and everything being all right. Because all the death and destruction to the rest of the world is irrelevant.You expect the bad script, the dodgy acting, the implausible plot (fat, middle aged men being trained in 12 days to be astronauts? Including one who appears to be retarded?). But I couldn't believe the racism and xenophobia implied in the film, and the callous disregard for the lives of anyone not corn-fed American.It's a chilling indictment of the attitude of a section of Western Society to the world.And it's a crappy film too.",Armageddon
947,tdglory49,One of the best movies I have ever seen.,8,28 June 2005,"I've watched this movie a number of times, and it remains one of my all-time favorites. I know that a number of people, namely critics, hate this movie, for reasons that continue to elude me. In my mind, this is a fun, big-budget movie with great acting.The premise is that NASA and its director, Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) has discovered that a meteor the size of Texas is going to hit the Earth in eighteen days and cause a complete extinction of nearly all life on the planet. After putting all their heads together, their best idea is...to drill into the asteroid's core and blow it up from the inside?! So they call in the best of the best, Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) and his team of oil drillers.As for the acting, while I'm not a huge fan of Thornton (""Monster's Ball"" ""Friday Night Lights""), he did a more than serviceable job as Truman. As always, Willis (""Sin City"" ""Pulp Fiction"" the ""Die Hard"" movies) is inherently likable and can deliver any one-liner, no matter how corny it is, and make it seem bad-a$$. Liv Tyler (""Lord of the Rings"" ""Inventing The Abbotts) plays Harry's daughter Grace who has grown up on oil rigs with her over-protective dad. While I'm not a fan of Tyler, either, she did very well in this movie. Ben Affleck (""Good Will Hunting"" ""Changing Lanes"") plays A.J., the young driller who is constantly at odds with Harry but also happens to be engaged to Grace. While everyone and their mother currently seems to be in a ""Ben Affleck is the worst actor ever and deserves to rot in hell"" mode, this movie is yet another movie to refute this claim. Affleck is confident, but not cocky, and like Willis, is both inherently likable and has some pretty good one-liners. In fact, of the four stars in this movie, Affleck is probably the best.Harry's crew also includes his longtime friend Chick (Will Patton, ""Remember The Titans"" ""Gone In Sixty Seconds""), the big Bear (Michael Clarke Duncan, ""The Green Mile"" ""Sin City""), the horny Rockhound (Steve Buscemi, ""Con Air"" ""Fargo""), the cowboy-like Oscar (Owen Wilson, ""Starsky and Hutch"" ""Zoolander""), Noonan (Clark Heathcliffe Brolly), and Max (Ken Campbell). Keith David (""Pitch Black"" ""Crash"") plays General Kimsey, who opposes every move NASA makes, and Jason Issacs (the ""Harry Potter"" movies, ""The Patriot"") plays NASA's super intelligent scientist. William Fichtner (""Crash"" ""The Perfect Storm""), one of my personal favorite actors, plays Colonel Sharp, one of the astronauts who must help guide the team on the asteroid. If you haven't been able to tell by now, the supporting cast is an all-star one and does a brilliant job.The effects in the movie are very good, and it is obvious this was a high-budget film. Yes, there are some anomalies and other oddities, but for crying out loud, it's a movie! It's allowed to change things (to a degree) to help them be more entertaining. There are mistakes like this in all movies simply to make it more coherent, dramatic, etc. As long as this doesn't bother you, you should be pleased with what this movie has to offer.My biggest complaints are that in some scenes, especially those containing spaceships, it seem to have gotten edited too fast, leaving a bit of confusion as to what exactly's happening until the dust settles, and that the dialogue can be corny on some rare occasions (""This is one order you shouldn't follow and you f**king know it."")which is surprising considering J.J. Abrams of ""Alias"" and ""Lost"" fame is listed as a screenwriter. Neither of these flaws are that detrimental.So in my opinion give this movie a shot. You may be pleasantly surprised.",Armageddon

952,alex_moffatt,Poor Physics,1,1 March 2013,"This is the worst film I think I've ever seen. I'm not even going to start on the ridiculous clichés, numerous countdowns or abhorrent acting, no, it was the shameless disregard of modern physics which was the biggest let down.I have a limited background in physics, but I know a few basic things about space; a rock the size of Texas cannot have the same gravitational pull as that of the Earth, the difference between detonating a bomb on the surface and detonating a bomb 800ft into a rock the size of Texas will make absolutely no difference, a rock the size of Texas could not simply cleaved in 2 by a bomb, there is no wind or fire in space, the smartest people on the planet would not forget to take the moons gravitational pull into account when predicting the trajectory of the rock (it's like the only thing to consider) and the list goes on. Every scene was painful as I could no longer watch the film, only spot yet another error. The only sympathy I felt was that towards modern science. R.I.P. Sir Isaac Newton.",Armageddon

I especially loved the scene where the two rockets pass the moon orbit. You would definitely not be able to sit down when you watch this movie. I gotta tell you I wasn't. Once again, Bruce Willis and Ben Affleck were great. The filming was great and all actors were chosen as if they couldn't be chosen otherwise. I wouldn't imagine anybody else but Bruce Willis playing this part. Wonderful combination of action, fun, adrenaline, drama, special effects, great music also. Very realistic. Great movie.",Armageddon

This movie is ridiculously touching to guys. Now, all films are subjective and no one person's opinion is better than anyone else's and in my opinion this movie was so freaking amazing! I'm sorry, but that scene when Ben Affleck is about to sacrifice himself (spoiler), but then Bruce rips his oxygen cord out and goes in his place...SERIOUSLY?! Damn... And that scene when Bruce is talking to Liv Taylor? Geeeeeez...I conveniently had *ahem* allergic reactions with my tear ducts, during that time. This movie is a freaking 10 out of 10 for me because the movie had me emotionally torn and left me with this lasting bittersweet feeling. If a movie that I saw 15 years ago still has this great impression left on me, it's done its job successfully. Thanks for listening to my post and I hope this helped you decide whether or not you wanted to watch this movie.",Armageddon

I was fifteen and it was my last summer with my friends because my family was moving south. We catched the late screening and when we emerged from the darkness of the movie theater my life felt like it had changed, I had cried, laughed and fallen in love with Liv Tyler, all in one night. I can point to the obvious flaws that the movie has but that doesn't matter in the least to me because the feeling it gave was like nothing before and nothing ever since. It made me feel good and made me feel that no matter what everything was going to be ok. It took me on a blazing ride trough love, asteroid belts and iron ferrite, and it never skipped a beat. Probably the same feeling the Independence crew felt like during the roadrunner thrust move 😉 accompanied by Aerosmith, and Hans Zimmer, amongst others it made for a very cinematic and EXTREMELY Hollywood-esque motion picture!",Armageddon

I think the acting is great from Bruce Willis as he does play what he does best in his sarcastic tough-guy role which makes the film very entertaining.

I also thought Peter Stormare was quite good, the Russian Cosmonaut.I really don't think it deserves the average of 5.9.

Before I watched this movie, I never really thought about the end of the world. This movie changed it forever. I was super scared after watching it. I would suggest you watch this movie when you're sure you can handle it.Now let's get into the review. The scenes are really realistic. Despite the slightly unrealistic scenario (the drill that drills in a comet and places a nuke inside) it is a well played movie. I remember one scene really good that made a big impact on me. It's a shot made after the comet was made public. You see a bunch of cars and campers on a street with everybody outside of their car with the air raid siren in the background. The fear on people their faces was so realistic. Every time I hear the air raid siren, I think of that scene (wich is every four weeks on Monday here in The Netherlands). The ending was a bit cliché. I saw it coming from miles away. In all these types of movies the main player dies. And in the way it happened, as a sacrifice, really made it too cliché.

975,beergood,Makes Independence Day seem subtle and nuanced.,1,16 February 2007,"It's hard to believe that a movie about a bunch of oil drillers taking a spaceship to a comet, with the purpose of blowing it up with a nuclear bomb, could be over the top. But, somehow, it is.The origin of this movie has to somehow involve a bar bet. Jerry Bruckheimer must have wagered Michael Bay that he couldn't make the most overblown sensationalized movie ever. Well Jerry, you owe Michael this time, because he did it.If Mr. Bay were to eat like he directs, then he would easily weigh in at 2 tons. There is not a single scene in this movie that doesn't want to be grandiose, not a single line of dialog that wouldn't be improved with the actor taking a giant bite out of a ham sandwich after delivery.I have actually once been, with a few hundred other people, in a life or death situation. You know what not one person did the entire time? Made a funny or irreverent quip. Can you believe that? Now, I know that this is an action movie, and little one liners are a staple of the action genre. Believe it or not, I love them (two of my all time favorite movies are A Boy and His Dog, and Hell Comes to Frogtown), but his movie exhausted even my patience for them.Try and watch this, if for no other reason than to see what happens when hundreds of people take leave of there senses, and collaborate on what so obviously had to seem like a steaming turd from day one.This movie is like Michael Jackson's face.

I enjoyed how there were countless one-liners that added a light-hearted approach to the most perilous of situations. Seemed like something funny was said at least once every 2 minutes or so. The casting was great...it was great to see Steve Buscemi in an intelligent role instead of playing the oddball, like he does in most Adam Sandler movies. Granted, there are some rather cheesy lines scattered here and there, but then again what movie doesn't? Occasionally you'll come across a scene after you've seen the whole movie a few times where you'll roll your eyes because you have to sit through it again. Armageddon is sometimes a little fast-paced, and I had to watch it a couple times to keep track of all the characters and what was going on with each of them. Special effects were great though. Keep in mind Armageddon is NOT perfectly in-tune with science. I've counted many aspects of the movie that don't line up with science (either realistically or mathematically), but dwelling on those errors will only prevent you from enjoying the movie.

I gave this movie two stars out of ten just for the actors they had in it are two of my favorites(Billy Bob and Bruce) and i also rated it so low for one of my least favorite actors(Ben 'afflicted' Afflek) one of the worst actors of our time. And he broke up with j-lo, terrible idea. If Afflek woulda been replaced, I might have changed my vote from two stars to four. still a terrible movie. And finally, the director: Michael Bay. Man, he has made some classic movies. Why does he like the afflicted one so much? He starred in Pearl Harbor, which was so historically incorrect it was ridiculous.

Willie Sharpe and Harry Stamper the teamwork they demonstrate on the asteroid is good. It shows how important teamwork is even if you don't always get along with the people you work with.

987,malloryrhillstrom,"""Armageddon?"" More Like ArmaGAINING Critics' Approval",10,17 January 2019,"If you're looking for an action-packed, emotionally powerful movie that grasps your attention in an instant, Armageddon is the movie for you. This movie exceeded my expectations in nearly every way, through its enriching plot and acting, exceptional directing by Michael Bay, and its core concept of the power of relationships.The movie opens up with action right away, with a meteor shower. It first impacts a space shuttle, and then hits Earth in various locations, causing chaos and fear in people's eyes, as they don't know what is going to happen next. This scene catches people's attention, and is a powerful opening to what the rest of the film has in store. NASA then discovers a Texas-sized asteroid approaching Earth and they have 18 days until it hits. This causes panic in the space station, and everyone bands together to try to find a solution to this massive problem. It's a race against the clock to stop the asteroid before it's too late. They came to the solution of blowing up the asteroid from the inside, with the help of some oil drillers.Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis), an experienced deep sea driller is hired by NASA to essentially save the planet. No pressure, right? He agrees to the task, but insists he brings his own men with him, as it makes him feel more comfortable. One of his men, A.J. (Ben Affleck), is dating his daughter, Grace (Liv Tyler), and this is hard for Stamper to handle, as he is the typical overprotective father. Grace has been travelling with her dad throughout her life, as her mother left the picture. She created a family with the guys onboard, and they treat her as they would their own child. They have a strong bond that no one could take away. Bruce Willis' performance was superb as he portrays a character that is tough, yet vulnerable as he cares about his daughter. He also offers a sarcastic charisma, which helps ease the tension of their life-threatening circumstances. While Bruce Willis' impressive acting is evident in other well known movies like Die Hard and Sixth Sense, where he plays strong characters, he brings a unique depth to the character of Harry Stamper specifically. His powerful performance adds a lot to both the story and the film as a whole.One of the elements that made this movie so powerful was the use of music to create certain moods. Music had the power to increase the intensity of a moment or a scene and evoke emotion from the viewer. This film uses the powerful song, ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing"" by Aerosmith multiple times. This song helped create a deeper emotional connection to the characters and the relationships that they formed. Michael Bay also implemented strong visual effects to portray space, and action scenes involving explosions. This was crucial to the film, because it made it more authentic and helped create a realistic portrayal of events. Some think that certain scenes seem impractical, as their bomb wouldn't be able to blow up an asteroid of that size. I recognize these complaints, but little details like these don't make or break the movie, as it is a fictional film.A core theme of the film is the power of relationships in one's life. Relationships add to the depth and the power of this film. Harry has a special bond with his men, as he spends nearly everyday working with them. Harry is extremely tough on the outside, and hardly shows how much he cares, but it's there. And he of course has the relationship with his daughter, who is the light of his life, and does anything to make her happy. Grace, in particular was the main reason that he decided to complete this task, in all efforts to make her proud.This movie is a must see, and thoroughly impressed me on all levels: plot, acting, visual effects, and emotional appeal. It also captured the core theme of the importance of well-developed relationships. It grasped my attention from start to end, and never failed to keep me on the edge of my seat. Michael Bay's fantastic directing made this film an entertaining masterpiece, and I recommend it to anyone seeking an action-packed, heartfelt experience.",Armageddon

No. All the disaster films of the 70's were big budget and very entertaining...and so was Armageddon which I compare it to those great films. This is a fantastic, big budget, over the top action film with the same feeling as those 70's films. The cast was excellent and I'm disappointed when a see an actor 'disowning' a film that they star in that was so good. People need to stop picking movies apart for the fact that they're not 'real'...they're movies...they're for entertainment value and this one delivers!",Armageddon
