0,TheLittleSongbird,A worthwhile raid,7,1 May 2018,"The general reputation for films based on video games is not a good one. From those seen, it is not surprising that they generally have not been well received and that as a films-based-on-video-games group the reputation is dubious.Saw 'Tomb Raider', despite some apprehension because the critical reception was fairly lukewarm and so were the reactions from friends (whose opinions are ones that are always respected and often agreed with), as someone who likes Alicia Vikander and although it's been years as someone with fond memories of the games. Although it has also been years since seeing them, am familiar with the two 'Tomb Raider' films with Angelina Jolie. Remember quite liking the first, while also not caring for the second and being pleasantly surprised by Jolie. 'Tomb Raider' (2018), while far from perfect or one of the year's best films (far from being one of the worst too), turned out to be worth the while. Another case of liking it more than the critics did, while seeing where they're coming from. Will agree with anybody who didn't find the script great. It's not terrible, it does intrigue and the tone at least is clear. Too much of it though is clunky, especially in the more exposition-oriented parts that are not as interesting or resonant as ought generally and veer on the banal.Story similarly is flawed. Again, a long way from a disaster as it was taut and fun and kept me engaged with some nice clever nods to the games. It is not an original one, some of it even is pretty derivative, and it is not always logical. Mostly am not one to criticise a film for having plot holes, find it to be a very lazy and unfair reason to criticise a film for (especially when it is the only thing that some reviews for certain films mention), but will briefly mention without spoilers that they are there and they are pretty big. The ending is not really a surprise at all, actually as predictable as one would expect.Characters tend to be one-dimensional and too neatly black and white. The father-daughter relationship and story does have heart, and the closest thing to development, but for instance Daniel Wu's character didn't fit very well, out of place actually, and Wu didn't look very comfortable. However, 'Tomb Raider' is far from a bad film. It does what it said on the tin, knew what it wanted to be and who to aim it for and kept me entertained and engaged throughout, even with its issues. There is fun and intrigue, and also a taut pace. The film starts promisingly on a gritty note and the action is exciting and energetically choreographed, with some jaw-dropping stunts and extravagant and not over-used or abused special effects that looked like a lot of time and effort went into them.On a visual level, 'Tomb Raider' looks great. Beautifully shot, with lots of audaciousness and grit, editing that is slick and lively and wonderfully exotic locations. Plus the effects. The most striking and arresting visuals are the Devil's sea storm, the underground pagoda tomb and the remains of the crashed airplane. The pulsating, without being overbearing, music score gives 'Tomb Raider' a lot of life, as does Uthaug's suitably muscular direction. There are brains and a heart here, as well as good thrills. Other than Wu, the cast do a great job. Alicia Vikander's performance is a committed one and a more than worthy successor to Jolie, also a great lead performance in its own right, doing her best to have Lara as more than an action hero. Kristin Scott Thomas and Derek Jacobi are as ever dependable with not an awful lot to do. Dominic West is a compassionate presence. The best performance though comes from Walton Goggins, terrific as the villain. All in all, worthwhile. 7/10 Bethany Cox",Tomb Raider
1,Leofwine_draca,"Not perfect, but not bad either",6,27 December 2018,"TOMB RAIDER is the latest Hollywood reboot, this time of the video game series about a female archaeologist scouring the globe and penetrating ancient tombs for their secret treasures. Previously two lacklustre movies were made with Angelina Jolie, and the good news is that this is a step up from those. It's not perfect, not by any means, but it's worth a single watch at least and it has some genuinely good elements to see it through. The film is still far too reliant on cheesy CGI action sequences which have no sense of danger whatsoever, which is why the best bit of action in the whole thing is the early bike chase through the streets of London, propelled along as it is by strong cinematography and efficient stuntwork. Alicia Vikander is far better in the role than Jolie ever was, putting across a sense of pride and toughness, and truth be told it's the first time I've actually liked her in something. Dominic West gives the best and most assured performance as the missing father. Okay, so Walton Goggin's villain is a weak spot and the running time is a bit overlong, especially in midsection where things flag a little, but with Daniel Wu in support and some nihilistic moments, this is better than something equivalent, like, say, Tom Cruise's THE MUMMY.",Tomb Raider
2,SnoopyStyle,video game movie,6,1 June 2018,"Lara Croft (Alicia Vikander) is a poor bike courier in London. Under pressure from Ana Miller (Kristin Scott Thomas), she decides to sign the papers declaring her missing father (Dominic West) dead and claim the family fortune. Before signing, she finds a clue which leads to her father's last quest to find Queen Himiko's tomb. She finds help from sea captain Lu Ren (Daniel Wu) and is captured by Mathias Vogel (Walton Goggins) who is using slave labor to dig for the tomb.This version of Croft intrigued me at first. Vikander is an interesting actress. The movie pulled me in by her losing that first fight. I was with her until I wasn't. Somewhere along the line, I got enough jumping to grab the edge of something or jumping to crash into something. It's a constant reminder that this is a video game movie and it won't stop. I kept thinking that I want a movie, not a video game pretending to be a movie. Eventually, I did lose interest but there is enough to recommend still.",Tomb Raider
3,Prismark10,Tomb Raider,4,5 August 2020,"Lara Croft has been rebooted as an origins film but it is a lacklustre pastiche of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.Lara Croft (Alicia Vikander) works as a poor bike courier in London, unable to afford to go to university. Even though her missing father Lord Richard Croft (Dominic West) controlled many companies now run by associate Ana Miller (Kristin Scott Thomas.)Lara could claim her father's companies and fortune if she legally declared him dead. However Lara finds a clue that leads to a message to destroy his research about Queen Himiko's tomb. She goes off to Hong Kong to look for her father and his search for the mystical tomb on an island near Japan. As Lara's search progresses she learns new skills.An illogical story, a generic bad guy, some messy action scenes and Vikander lacks the pneumatic assets of Angelina Jolie. The film never progresses much from its video game roots.",Tomb Raider
4,claudio_carvalho,Dumb and Full of Clichés,4,3 June 2018,"Action films are usually made in order that the viewer does not think and enjoy the action only. Clichés are common but ""Tomb Raider"" adds another ingredient to the formula: one of the dumbest storylines ever. This wannabe Indiana Jones introduces Lara Croft, living in financial difficulties in London only because she does not acknowledge that her father, who is missing for seven years, is dead. She does not go to the university and does not have money for anything while his fortune is administrated by executives. She finds a lead where he might be and instead of receiving her inheritance and organizing an adequate expedition to look for him, she prefers to go to the pawnshop to raise money and travel alone. Her father asks her only one thing, to destroy his research about Himiko since it would be dangerous to mankind if in wrong hands. And our heroin does exactly the opposite, taking the documents exactly to his enemies. Last but not the least, her father survives seven years alone in the wilderness to keep Himiko´s tomb closed. In a couple of days, our heroin succeeds in opening the tomb for the enemy and witnesses the death of her father after seven years living in extreme danger. My vote is four.Title (Brazil): ""Tomb Raider: A Origem"" (""Tomb Raider:The Origin"")",Tomb Raider
5,nogodnomasters,Where's the floor?,8,26 March 2018,"There is no sense in talking about the plot, they are all basically the same...Lara in Japan with a bow doing a plot that will give you Indy flashbacks. This is a reboot. The budget is less and the film is far less exotic. Alicia Vikander as Lara Croft is not an over sexed, shower talking, tight garment person. She is likeable and down to earth, far more realistic, than Angelina for better or worse. I don't know how many more tomb puzzles and disappearing floors the public can take, but here comes another one. Guide: F-word. No sex or nudity. No shower scene, no tight clothing, no clothes removal patch.",Tomb Raider
6,kosmasp,Lara reborn,6,9 July 2018,"Let's talk about the elephant in the room first, that is if you are or were a fan of the game series this is based on. Alicia is not physically/anatomically close to what you would expect and she was the first to admit that and point it out in interviews herself. She also was saying, that Tomb Raider was her in, what made her want to play games. And like her a lot of young girls had that experience. Unlike many other girls she was able to live out her dream and for that you should not hate her or bash her.Having put that aside, an origin story is always tough to pull off. And it's not that different here. There are many cliches and Alicia has her work cut out for her. There are quite a few moments that will remind the gamers of certain things. Though losely based on the newer games, this is still aiming to please as many people as possible. Not sure if it was succesful enough to green light another one, but I certainly wouldn't mind (there's a short scene right after the credits start ... another nod, don't miss out on it)",Tomb Raider
7,classicsoncall,"""You messed with the wrong family.""",7,27 March 2018,"For action-adventure movie fans, this one is just about all action with virtually no rest stops in between. That's not necessarily a good thing, because with all the bone crunching, trauma inducing body blows our heroine has to endure, you have to wonder how she made it out of the first act. That's my principal complaint with these kinds of movies, as it's humanly impossible to take that kind of punishment and keep on ticking. I will say Alicia Vikander was a good choice to portray Lara Croft; she's good looking with a build that accents her athleticism, so when she (or her double) executes some of those fantastic saves, you could almost believe it was happening for real. But talk about getting into situations - how about that junk plane straddling the waterfall? The script writers went to the well about three or four times in that tight spot alone. And if I was a betting man, there's no way Lara would have been able to turn those rocky cylinders on the ancient temple without busting a nail. Come on, sometimes I'm stymied with a tight bottle cap, and here she's betting the ranch on bringing down a villain bent on delivering the secrets of Queen Homiko. Which by the way, I generally like Walton Goggins in villain roles, but it didn't look like he was putting much into his character here. Give me Boyd Crowder any day. In sum, an action movie for action movie fans who can't get enough, but leave your thinking cap at the door.",Tomb Raider
8,jboothmillard,Tomb Raider,5,24 March 2018,"The original 1996 video game was a big hit, then it was turned into a stinker of a movie with Angelina Jolie (and a pointless sequel followed), then in 2013 the makers of the game reinvented the lead character and her origins, that is what is brought to life in this reboot to the franchise. Basically Lara Croft (The Danish Girl's Alicia Vikander) is the daughter of eccentric adventurer Lord Richard Croft (Dominic West), since his disappearance she has become an independent woman, working as a bike courier. She is arrested following a bike accident involving a police car, she is bailed by her father's business partner Ana Miller (Kristin Scott Thomas), she warns Lara that if she does not claim her father's inheritance, the family estate will be sold off. She reluctantly attends a meeting with Mr. Yaffe (Derek Jacobi), an associate at Croft Holdings, to sign the documents, but before she does so he gives her a puzzle box her father showed her. Lara solves it, it has a photo, and a clue that she deciphers, it leads her to a secret room, activated at her father's wall gravestone, inside she finds her father's hidden office. Lara watches a pre-recorded message from Richard, detailing his research into Himiko, the mythical Queen of Yamatai who was said to command the power over life and death, Richard warns Lara to destroy all of his research, but Lara decides not to, so she can investigate further. Lara travels to Hong Kong, Richard's last known location, she finds and hires Lu Ren (Daniel Wu), captain of the ship Endurance, to sail into the Devil's Sea to the island of Yamatai. The ship capsizes in a violent storm, Lara is knocked unconscious and washed ashore, she is revived by Mathias Vogel (The Hateful Eight's Walton Goggins), leader of an expedition to locate Himiko's tomb, funded by shadowy organisation Trinity, seeking to harness and weaponize Himiko's power. Lara is taken prisoner by Vogel, who claims he killed her father, and intends to use Richard's research to continue the expedition. Lara escape with the help of Lu Ren, who also survived the storm, he has been put to work with the local fishermen digging for Himiko's tomb, Lara evades capture, but is badly injured in the process. She passes out from her injuries, but regains consciousness, she is forced to kill a Trinity guard when she is nearly discovered, then she follows a mysterious figure wandering the island, Lara is shocked to discover it is her father. Lara convinces Richard that she is real, he treats her injuries, he is upset that she did not listen to his instructions to destroy his research, despite his protesting, Lara sets off to recover it from Vogel's camp. Lara reunites with Lu Ren, they set up a series of distractions for the guards, allowing her to infiltrate the camp and recover her father's research, Richard has followed, and identifies the opening to Himiko's tomb, he is captured by Vogel, who persuades Lara to open it. The party navigate a series of booby traps and locate Himiko's sarcophagus, two Trinity soldiers attempt to remove her corpse, but become infected by her ""power"", which is actually a potent disease that causes immediate bodily disintegration triggered by mere physical contact. Vogel concludes that Himiko's body cannot be removed, he settles on detaching a finger, placing it in a pouch, Lara and Richard overpower the remaining soldiers, but Vogel escapes, and Richard becomes infected. Knowing there is no cure, Richard proposes destroying Himiko's tomb to prevent the virus spreading worldwide, Lara is heartbroken that she will lose her father again, but agrees, chasing after Vogel, as Richard sets off a bomb, killing himself and sealing the tomb. Lara confronts Vogel and they fight, she force-feeds him Himiko's finger and kicks him down a deep chasm as the infection takes over, she is rescued by Lu Ren and the fishermen, they commandeer a Trinity helicopter to escape Yamatai. Lara returns to London, where she signs the documents formally accepting her inheritance, then she inadvertently discovers that Trinity's front company is actually owned by Croft Holdings, proceeding to further investigate Trinity. Lara suspects Ana Miller is one of Trinity's agents who manipulated her into accepting her inheritance in order to have her sign over control of business operations, having seen Trinity's ruthlessness first-hand, she prepares for her next adventure to thwart their future plans, buying two Glocks from pawn shop owner and gun salesman Max (Nick Frost) and his wife Pamela (Jaime Winstone). Also starring Hannah John-Kamen as Sophie and Alexandre Willaume as Lieutenant. Vikander is a good choice, not just because she is beautiful and looks just like the revamped game version of the character, but she is much more humanistic and obviously toughens up as it goes along, the support of West and Scott Thomas are fine as well. The story is much more thought out this time around, working as both an origins story, and a good excuse to have Indiana Jones style exploring, there are some thrilling moments, it is very likely there will be more to come, an entertaining enough action adventure. Worth watching!",Tomb Raider
9,ma-cortes,Moving and thrilling globe-trotting blockbuster in which Lara Croft searches for her father in a mysterious and exotic island,6,12 April 2020,"A thrilling visualisation of the computer game with the valiant adventurer become into a virtual hero, dealing with a powerful heroine and a strong emotional undertow.

As In this first adventure LaraCroft/Alicia Vikander earning justly her name : Tomb Raider. The film contains high adventure, emotion, frenetic action, and gorgeous exteriors. Alicia Vikander is pretty good as the brave Lara Croft determined to forge her own patth, that's why she abandons everything she knows behind, in search for her missing dad trying to to solve the puzzle of his mysterious disappearance. It packs a colorful and brilliant cinematography by George Richmond. As well as a moving and stirring musicak score by Junkie XLM .The motion picture was professionally directed by Roar Uthaug, though with no originality.

10,BA_Harrison,Croft unoriginal.,4,25 December 2018,"As much as I disliked the original noughties Tomb Raider movie, I have to admit that Angelina Jolie had the requisite physical attributes to play the part, namely pneumatic boobs and a strong pair of thighs; Alicia Vikander is a more politically correct Croft for 2018: pretty rather than sexy, much more realistically proportioned and lacking a really short pair of shorts. Put simply, she's not the character that fans know and love from the video game.Not only does this reboot get the central character wrong, but it also falls short in the plot department with a generic adventure involving a lost tomb and a secret order that seeks to rule the world. In order to appeal to the lucrative Asian market, the film is predominantly set in the Far East, where Lara attempts to locate her father, who went missing seven years earlier while searching for the tomb of Himiko, first queen of Japan. Her quest leads her to an island where she encounters bad guys also looking for the tomb. Forgettable set-pieces follow, with tepid thrills and lots of CGI, all leading to the inevitable climax where Croft defeats bad guy Mathias Vogel (Walton Goggins) before running for her life as the tomb collapses around her ears.It's all very predictable and far from the impressive reboot that I had hoped for. Despite the final scene in which we see Croft purchasing her iconic fire-arms (she uses a bow and arrow in this film), I doubt very much if we will get to see her using them anytime soon.",Tomb Raider
11,paul_haakonsen,This was essentially just a Tomb Raider light...,5,9 June 2018,"While this movie by itself sure was an entertaining enough movie, it just felt like a complete and utter rip-off. Especially since this movie didn't feel like it had anything to do with the previous two movies with Angelina Jolie.So this whole rebooting of franchises is becoming far too annoying and is literally flashing a certain finger towards the audience whom might already like an established universe.The action sequences were adequate, but the whole first part of the movie with the biking and courier job just felt entirely pointless and served the story in no way.They had a fairly good cast in the movie. Personally I didn't think that Alicia Vikander managed to reach up to the legacy that Angelina Jolie left with her two movie performances as Lara Croft. Dominic West and Daniel Wu were both doing great jobs in lifting up the movie. I was most thrilled about seeing Alexandre Willaume in a movie such as this, as that was a utter surprise.The plot was generic and predictable. So there was little in terms of surprises and twists along the way as the storyline and plot rolled down a very linear path.This movie was not particularly outstanding and I doubt that I will ever return to watch it a second time.",Tomb Raider
12,zardoz-13,"Oh, Where, Oh Where, Has Angelina Jolie Gone?",5,28 March 2018,"The long-awaited reboot of ""Tomb Raider"" runs out of momentum about an hour into its melodramatic, 111-minute running time. Basically, this low-tech, pedestrian, prequel to the 2001 original Angelina Jolie blockbuster adheres to the same standard-issue formula that has changed little since movie serials like ""Jungle Girl"" (1941) and ""Perils of Nyoka"" (1942). Unlike the usual arbitrary remake, however, ""Tomb Raider"" does have some justification for its existence. The ""Tomb Raider"" videogame has changed over the years, and the Lara Croft character has embodied some of those changes. No longer the bubble-breasted, tank-top clad babe of the Jolie years, the new younger Lara is far more sinewy than sexy. Oscar-winning Swedish actress Alicia Vikander has appropriated the role, and she is the only thing good about this generic franchise update. Everything else pales by comparison. Historically, Jolie's ""Tomb Raider"" ushered in a new era in Hollywood's depiction of action heroines after the supercharged, 1990 French action thriller ""Le Femme Nikita"" had made gals look sexy with guns in hand. Unfortunately, the ""Tomb Raider"" sequel ""Lara Croft: The Cradle of Time"" (2003) didn't live up to the potential of its predecessor, and the franchise faded into obscurity. Meantime, the ""Resident Evil"" videogame franchise followed in Lara's footsteps, and fared far more successful. Eventually, not only did Milla Jovovich starred in the original ""Resident Evil,"" but she also toplined in the five sequels that ensued from 2002 to 2016. Lara faces implausible perils galore, but she always finds an easy-out in the most cliffhanger situations. Unfortunately, the far-fetched, derring-do that Alicia Vikander performs for Norwegian director Roar Uthaug with primitive weapons, either a bow & arrow or rocks strewn nearby represent a strictly back-to-basics austerity. Indeed, our heroine doesn't acquire her signature pair of pistols until she returns to London to inaugurate her reign as the new Lady Croft. Lord Richard Croft (Dominic West of ""Punisher: War Zone"") has been missing for seven years. The eminent archaeologist's daughter, Lara Croft (Alicia Vikander of ""Ex Machina""), hopes her dad will return. She remains convinced that Lord Croft still lives. Lara's legal guardian Anna Miller (Kristin Scott Thomas of ""The English Patient""), who manages Lord Croft's billion-dollar empire, has urged her repeatedly to write Richard off for dead. Not only would this bring closure to an impossible predicament, but Lara could also stop living like a pauper with millions within reach of her fingertips! She earns her living as a bicycle courier in East London. Initially, this fiercely independent attitude makes Lara seem both courageous but sympathetic. She refuses to take the easy way out, and she prefers to forge her own fortune rather than live off her father's affluence. This nonconformist streak doesn't prevent her from coming up second in every fracas. In a desperate bid to pay off her gym bill, she participates as the fox in a citywide bicycle chase with scores of guys in swift pursuit, behaving as the hounds after her fox. They've attached a paint can to her bike and punctured it. If nobody can overtake her before that paint runs out, which marks her trail, Lara will walk off a wad of loot. Instead, she collides with a police cruiser and winds up in jail. Anna has to bail reluctant heiress out. The first hour offers greater spontaneity than the somnambulant second hour. Lara legally declares Richard Croft dead. At this point, she receives a puzzle box that sends her back to the Croft Manor family crypt. Activating a hidden button in the crypt inscription, she descends into her father's secret workshop. She discovers a camcorder with a videotape of him. Eccentric Lord Richard implores his daughter to destroy all his research on a fabulous Asian sorceress, the Queen of Yamatai, known more notoriously as Himiko. Folklore maintains that the evil Himiko possesses is the power over life and death. Rather than obey her father, Lara takes the research with her on a global expedition to reconnect with her father. Little does she realize the magnitude of her error. In Hong Kong, she locates the son of the captain who took Lord Croft to a remote Japanese island. The reluctant son, Lu Ren (Daniel Wu of ""Geostorm""), accommodates Lara with a cruise into the tumultuous Devil's Sea. A catastrophic storm shipwrecks them on a craggy desert island encircled by a treacherous reef. Eventually, our plucky heroine confronts the primary villain, Mathias Vogel (Walton Goggins of ""Cowboys & Aliens""), who operates a slave labor camp. Vogel has been searching for the ancient tomb of Himiko, a Japanese goddess of death. A wealthy clandestine organization codenamed Trinity employs Vogel. Once he locates Himiko's tomb, Trinity wants him to convert its curse into a weapon. Unlike the Jolie epics, Lara reunites with her father who has been alive but marooned on the island like Robinson Crusoe. All along Vogel thought Richard was dead. Recapturing Richard, Vogel coerces Lara at gunpoint to solve all the puzzles and take them to Himiko's sarcophagus. This obstacle course that they embark upon to Himiko is rigged with booby-traps galore. Sadly, Indiana Jones would yawn at the hurdles these people navigate. ""Tomb Raider"" struggles to look realistic. Lara is no match for Vogel's gun-toting goons who are armed with assault rifles. She relies on her wits and their weaknesses to survive this ordeal. Presumably, scenarists Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Alastair Siddons borrowed heavily from Steven Spielberg's ""Indiana Jones of the Last Crusade"" for inspiration. The single set-piece that dazzles is the careening London bike chase. The final showdown between Lara and her unsavory adversaries after they discover the secret of Himiko's curse amounts to nothing spectacular. Walton Goggins specializes in objectionable villains, but he never runs amok. Dominic West is believable as Lara's ill-fated father. Enigmatic Kristin Scott Thomas lingers on the sidelines with a sinister smile. Ironically, despite the terrific makeover given Lara, ""Tomb Raider"" fails to breathe new life into this routine search for forbidden treasures.",Tomb Raider

15,oscaralbert,What is Warner Bros. warning us about . . .,7,19 March 2018,". . . with TOMB RAIDER? Because the general aim of this warning is in the basic direction of the bots which oversee what we can read and write here, I'll have to type the rest of this review in a complex code which only folks on the side of Right (who are at least as sharp as ""Lara Croft"" and Warner Bros.) will be able to comprehend. Back home on the Real Life Ranch, the news broke during TOMB RAIDER's opening weekend that sleeve cannon and his fright heart mob co-opted lace nook as their weapon of choice two years ago. This was no coincidence. Obviously, TOMB RAIDER's evil ""Trinity Corporation""--""They're everywhere, they're everywhere!!""--is Warner Bros.' code name in this movie for Humanity's Real Life extinction threat, lace nook. Since at least the 1920s, the always prophetic seers at Warner Bros. have been warning We Americans of (The Then) Far Future that some day (that is, TODAY) we might let our guard down and be in mortal danger of watching all of our Sacred Freedoms seeping away through a dark crack into the stifling nether regions of Authoritarian Tyranny to which lace nook has made us all too prone.",Tomb Raider

Nowegian director Roar Uthaug makes some exciting, heart-in-throat set pieces (a roaring water fall and a precarious rusted out plane is one for the film vaults) while instilling his heroine to use her brain over her brawn for the most part.

17,morrison-dylan-fan,Raiding the tomb.,8,22 March 2018,"Attending a performance of the Edgar Wallace play The Case of the Frightened Lady later that day,I decided to go to town early in order to see a movie. Having found Alicia Vikander's film choices to always be at least interesting, and with co-star Walton Goggins The Shield being my favourite TV series of all time, I excitingly got ready to open the tomb.View on the film:Playing the two main men in Lara's life, Walton Goggins and Dominic West (Shane Vendrell meets Jimmy McNulty!) give fun performances as boo-hiss baddie Mathias Vogel and her reckless dad Richard,with Goggins firing up Vogel's years of desperation to find the tomb,and West bringing a joy out in Richard witnessing Lara follow in his footsteps.Leaping into the first raided tomb, Alicia Vikander gives an excellent take on Lara. Doing the hand to hand combat and running stunts herself, Vikander gives the action a real crunch with a fluid performance of each sweeping punch/jump. Set before Lara gets her hands on the family cash, Vikander brings out the vulnerability in Lara over the question of Richards disappearance.Inspired by the 2013 re-boot of the video game, the writers do very well at giving the origin set-up a lightness,as each piece revealed about Lara's childhood is pushed with the momentum of an adventure on the horizon.Going into Adventure Movie mode, the writers get Lara to face an exciting obstacle course, from Vogel's henchmen to fighting to avoid going downstream,and raiding her first tomb. Locking the tomb up with curses, the writers intriguingly make the main twist be a change in perspective on the reason for the tomb being built.Riding the wave of his Disaster movie The Wave,director Roar Uthaug & cinematographer George Richmond successfully adapt the video game with closely held camera moves giving the leaps in physics for the major CGI set-pieces a cover system atmosphere. Presenting Lara as a real sporty type, Uthaug and Richmond give the hand to hand combat scenes a rough and tumble mood, with crisp tracking shots following Lara's run to be the first tomb raider.",Tomb Raider
18,trashgang,games are better,5,6 January 2019,"Lara Croft is in my live for many years starting off with the PS2 games and so it moved further into the well known flicks with Angelina Jolie to be picked up again in the gaming world delivering one of the better franchises in that particular industry. So of course a flick had to be made.I was looking forward to see this, playing Lara Croft gave me a lot of puzzles and a lot of fighting going on. Not so in this flick. I must even say, I never really got into the movie. Clocking in at almost 2 hours it's only the last half hour that the real Lara Croft comes in with puzzles and her famous bow. But before that we have Lara as a courier delivering packages. Going to Hong Kong with predictable situations then crossing a deadly sea to arrive on the island where things should become hard for her.I don't know, playing the game was more fun, and at the end of the movie she's going for guns, guess you know what kind of position she takes before the end credits.

19,deloudelouvain,Crofting = running and jumping without getting badly hurt,7,6 July 2018,"This was my first Tomb Raider movie, so I can't compare it with the previous movies. I see that alot of people hate it and that's their opinion. To me it was almost exactly what I expected. A movie based on a video game, adventurous with a story that is a bit far fetched, with stunts that are humanly impossible, but nonetheless it's entertaining and that's exactly what I want when watching a movie like this one, entertainment. Okay sometimes it's a bit exagerated that our heroin gets away from deadly traps without almost any scratch but that's always like that in this genre of movies. It's an adventure with a hero, so don't get to anal about those futilities. I can't compare Alicia Vikander with Angelina Jolie, because like said before I never watched the other ones, but I thought Alicia Vikander was worth watching in her character, as were the rest of the cast. So if you don't take this kind of stories too seriously and you just want a bit of easy entertainment then just give it a go.",Tomb Raider
20,Mr-Fusion,Maddeningly stiff adaptation,5,17 August 2018,"Video game based movies don't have a stellar track record and ""Tomb Raider"" does nothing to change that. To be perfectly fair, what this movie does right is its heroine. Alicia Vikander has that steely determination and certainly looks the part.But aside from the awful soundtrack, all of the film's problems lie in the script, which switches out the solid origin story of the 2013 reboot for a ""TRON: Legacy"" rehash. Good characters are scrapped because of this, and such a crime is unforgivable. Almost as bad as wasting Walton Goggins. I'm all for Vikander continuing in this role, bit deserves much better writing.",Tomb Raider
21,siderite,Such a bad movie!,5,1 June 2018,"It's a trap! I tried to enjoy it, you know, as a brainless movie you can just turn off your brain and enjoy the effects and the ridiculous adventures. Only I couldn't! Even with the brain turned off this movie is incredibly bad. People just do random things (with bad CGI! How is that even possible in 2018?!) that need to move not the story, but the next action scene forward. There are at least ten scenes that could have been solved by just applying the one neuron in Lara Croft's brain, but they would have ended in a second, rather than painful minutes of pointless running and battling gravity. You know this film is bad when gravity just loses by forfeit!Bottom line: the Angelina version was a brilliant work of art compared with this piece of crap.",Tomb Raider
22,Hellmant,Hopefully the sequel is much better.,6,22 March 2018,"'TOMB RAIDER': Three Stars (Out of Five)An action-adventure based on the popular 2013 video game, of the same name (both the game and the film are reboots of earlier hit series). The movie tells of the adventures of Lara Croft, now played by Alicia Vikander, as she struggles to solve the mystery of her father's sudden disappearance, 7-years earlier. The movie costars Dominic West, Walton Goggins, Daniel Wu and Kristin Scott Thomas. It was directed by Roar Uthaug, and it was scripted by Geneva Robertson-Dworet, Alastair Siddons and Evan Daugherty. The film has received mixed reviews from critics, but it's a huge hit at the international Box Office. I thought it was OK. The story begins seven years after the disappearance of the successful archaeologist Lord Richard Croft (West). His daughter, Lara (Vikander), has still not accepted that he's likely dead, and she's now living a very carefree and wild life. Richard's business partner, Ana Miller (Scott Thomas), bails Lara out of jail, and convinces her to accept her inheritance. Lara reluctantly agrees, and upon doing so, she discovers Richard's last known whereabouts: off the coast of Japan, searching for a mythical tomb. Her fist 'tomb raiding adventure' begins, in search of her missing father. The movie looks, and sounds, a lot more exciting than it actually is. Vikander is fantastic in the lead, and the visuals are stunning, but the film is still mostly just a bore. At least for me it was, but I'm getting more and more tired of most of Hollywood's big budget 'potential blockbuster' action movies. Some are really good, and I definitely still love a good exciting action flick (I grew-up on them), but this is not one of the especially good ones. Hopefully the first sequel is much better. I do think it's probably just as good as the Angelina Jolie films are though (although I don't remember much about them anymore).",Tomb Raider
23,cherold,the height of mediocrity,5,24 April 2019,"This Lara Croft origin story does nothing particularly well nor particularly badly. Star Alicia Vykander is adequate as the protagonist, although she lacks the roguish, Errol Flynn-style dash of Angelina Jolie. The story is decent though forgettable, much like the movie's action sequences. The movie respects the Tomb Raider game's history of puzzle-solving, although it diverges from those games in the number of ancient ruins.It's not painful to watch, it's not enjoyable to watch. I kind of regret bothering with it, because life is short and there are better movies out there, but I'm not brokenhearted over the time I sunk into it. It's just a tepid piece of Hollywood hack-work.Don't bother.",Tomb Raider

after the story was done, they added this ridiculous part to set up a sequel that was really dumb. the step mom was the leader of the organization trying to get the virus??? not only that, but they do the reveal while replaying certain things that were said earlier in the movie, which is pretty normal, but one of the things they repeated was said about 2 minutes earlier, no exaggeration. she told her step mom you can deal with the day to day stuff, and then she realized it as her mom walked away, and it repeated that same line as if we forgot about it",Tomb Raider

It's a surprise that it's as good as it is, with the middle section being a fun and enjoyable mix of excitement and (slightly iffy) intrigue. It ends up perhaps the best video-game movie I've seen, though it is certainly only inspired by the games and a major step down from them even in terms of its story-telling. I was entertained for most of the run-time, even during some of the more cringe-worthy moments. 6/10",Tomb Raider
26,Edvis-1997,Feedback,6,6 June 2018,I prefer original instead of that. Visuals sometimes looked nice but the movie is way too boring.,Tomb Raider
27,bowmanblue,A computer game movie that works? (almost),7,16 March 2018,"I couldn't get past the second level of 'Tomb Raider' on the Playstaion (1) back in the mid-nineties, so I found the whole 'Lara Croft thing' a little frustrating. I know I watch the two Angelina Jolie movies that were based on the computer game and have long since forgotten everything about them (apart from Chris Barrie from 'Red Dwarf' being underused in my opinion!) so my hopes weren't exactly sky-high for this 'reboot.' However, having watched it I was actually pleasantly surprised.Let's get this out the way, 'Tomb Raider' was nothing absolutely out of the ordinary and so original that it will change cinema forever. But then were you really expecting that? I was hoping for an enjoyable little action romp to entertain me for a couple of hours. And I got just that. Being part of the *ahem* 'older generation' who has spent a lifetime watching films, I can totally say that there is nothing in 'Tomb Raider' that hasn't been done before - sometimes better, sometimes worse. I can't think of a single negative thing to say about it (with the possibility of a few strained British accents being attempted here and there). However, just because I can't think of anything bad to say, doesn't mean it's perfect. It simply just is what it is - an action film.In case you don't know, a young British aristocrat (Lara Croft) finds clues to show that her father isn't dead and actually went on a secret expedition to, er, save the world I suppose. Therefore, she follows in his footsteps. And, luckily enough, she has spent her entire lifetime conveniently honing skills that will aid her in her quest. Alicia Vikander plays possibly a younger, less 'cartoony' version of Lara, as opposed to Angelina Jolie's more 'comic book' interpretation. The Tomb Raider games have - apparently - evolved from that same cartoony look and feel to a more gritty, darker take and I guess the film has followed closely in its footsteps. It's certainly more 'realistic' and less reliant on amazing stunts that would make James Bond blush. I preferred this approach as Lara handles herself more with her wits and only relies on her brawn when she absolutely has to, plus it would be totally unbelievable to see her beat up hordes of burly henchmen!I'm not sure which part of the film I preferred more - the first two thirds are pretty good, slowly building up to a climactic third act. However, when said climax arrives, it felt like the ending to another popular on-screen archaeologist's third outing ('Last Crusade' anyone?). I don't know whether this was a deliberate homage, but it did make me wonder why they'd gone with such (what I considered to be) a blatant rip-off.Anyway, I get the feeling I'm not this film's 'target audience.' I enjoyed it enough for being what it was - an enjoyable little action film that offered nothing I hadn't seen already and was designed to reboot the franchise and take it in a new direction. However, my thirteen year old daughter absolutely loved it and will be buying it on Blu-ray the moment it comes out!",Tomb Raider
28,ThomasDrufke,Vikander is a Force,7,3 April 2018,"I don't give much thought to the whole ""video game curse"" discussions. For me, I just view them as movies and if they're not good, they're not good. But if they're entertaining and they deserve to be seen, I'll treat them as such. Tomb Raider is absolutely a movie that should be seen. If not for anything else, because Alicia Vikander is a force to be reckoned with as a star in the making. There are few actresses who present as much charisma as Vikander on screen, and I sure hope she has a few more turns to take Lara Croft to the next level.The film doesn't present an intricately woven story nor an overly original take on anything in the film specifically, but it's undeniably entertaining. Vikander takes a few very silly elements, including a strangely placed bicycle chase, and makes them more than watchable. That's not something that can be said for most video game films. It's also worth noting that the CGI and action, which I was worried about when I saw the trailers, are actually pretty cool to look at. Yes, there's at least one visually weak scene and a few unfinished-looking wide shots, but for the most part the film looks pristine and big screen worthy. And the action improves upon all of the goofy moments of the originals by placing a heartfelt story at the center of the action. You don't have anything of value in the third act without a nicely told personal story between Lara and Richard, and that's one thing Tomb Raider made a concerted effort to do. I sure hope this film does well enough to get a sequel, because I think with a more original script (that has a director who's willing to take more chances), this series can quickly become the best video game series of films of all time. Which all fans know, isn't saying that much.7.9/10",Tomb Raider
29,ericstevenson,Probably the best live-action video game movie ever made,8,18 March 2018,"48% might not seem like a very high score on RottenTomatoes, but that's still the highest score ever for a movie based on a video game there! I simply have to like it! The weird thing is that this honestly doesn't feel that much like a movie based on a video game. Maybe that's because it's better than 90% of them! I remember how dumb it looked in the original ""Tomb Raider"" movies how Angelina Jolie wore padding because not even she could show off Lara's large boobs. Here they don't sexualize her at all.The plot is rather simple with Lara attempting to finish her father's research on studying the supernatural by going to a distant island. I admit to not knowing of a single character apart from Lara Croft in the series. The best parts are easily the way Lara communicates with her father. These are some really sincere scenes. The pacing is excellent as well. While not great, this is a much more down to earth video game movie. ***",Tomb Raider

However, a rival PhD (Walton Goggins) working for a clandestine organization also seeks the catacomb so he can weaponize its mystical powers.Too serious, too computerized and too maladroit, this millennial reboot of the once popular videogame/film franchise from the 2000s is a realistic origin story that fails to supersede its campy predecessor in almost every aspect.Likewise, all fatherless children say their dad vanished while looking for lost treasure.

33,851222,The most fun game based movie I've seen in million years,8,20 June 2018,"Greetings from Lithuania.To call a ""Tomb Raider"" (2018) a great movie found be a lie. But the truth is that i haven't had so much fun watching video game based movie in many moons. I loved both rebooted games on which this movie is based on (and can't wait for the third installment in game series). The truth is that both ""Tomb Raider"" games weren't really deep into their stories nor characters - it was about adventures, tombs and exploration. This movie gives exactly that - fun and good looking adventures. The performance by Alicia Vikander was very good - she carries the movie. But i would have loved to see more of Walton Goggins character - he was an interesting villain. Action sequences were good as well as set design.Overall, ""Tomb Raider"" isn't a great movie, but its a very fun adventure movie. Its closely based on its source material and doesn't tried to reinvent the wheel - it have me exactly what i was looking for from a ""Tomb Raider"" movie - a very fun adventure.",Tomb Raider
34,westsideschl,ZZZZ,2,30 June 2018,"This is how you destroy the mystery & fun of the original creative trend setting '90s Core/Eidos game you just do a lot of cheap formula plot structures. Had no depth, no soul. Perhaps not even as good as the Jolie versions. 
1. Evil queen sorceress entombed on Devil's Island in the Devil's Triangle (they got the location wrong). Chasm of Souls - the name deserves a ""give-me-a-break"" & also never developed. 
2. Baddies (named, of course, The Order of the Trinity an ancient militant organization) want to release the evil queen thinking to, of course, seek control over the supernatural in order to rule the fate of mankind (phew, women you're safe). 
3. Acting, including Vikander, was cutesy predictable and robotically rote. Dialogue is what's called ""dumbed down"". 
4. Action, basically same old ... Flying kicks, choke holds, body slams, ""zzzzz"" - not convincing, would not even match a Chinese D level martial arts film. The running scenes across boats & piers seemed really contrived as if by this point they needed something active. Bows & arrows? Is this a Hunger borrowing? Of course an unconvincing shootout is needed. 
5. Lack of details makes for a low grade movie. Lara pawns her only connection to mom - a family heirloom jade pendant (actually that style can be bought off ebay for just a few dollars). She needs money to save foreclosure on Croft Manor, but doesn't touch millions of dollars in antiques in her family crypt. Battery in camera after 7 years should be dead, dead. To sign or not sign death certificate to save family company & Manor was unclear & overly dramatic. The ship suddenly appears, with an out-of-nowhere storm, within hundreds of feet of a rocky shoreline. Duh! The result of an experienced navigator? Lara is washed ashore on remote beach and is quickly bonked by ""waiting-in-storm?"" person. That's called a strain of credulity. Younger Laras don't have same nose/ear structure (did Lara have surgery?).
6. Nothing original in this ""made-for-money-only"" movie. Even the puzzle boxes and puzzle wall not only have been done repeatedly in the past, but were just cheap lookin'.",Tomb Raider
35,Platypuschow,Tomb Raider: Another not needed reboot,5,5 September 2018,"When I heard that Tomb Raider was getting the reboot treatment I was less than excited, it just wasn't needed.Then the first stills from production came out and Alicia Vikander was revealed as this generations Lara Croft and I.................laughed. I've seen some bad casting but Vikander as Lara, really?Now don't get me wrong I like Alicia Vikander, she's a fantastic little actress and has demonstrated how good she is throughout her career (And seems incapable of ageing) but she isn't Lara Croft. Lara is the tall amazonian quintessential English woman and dinky Swedish Vikander was a bad choice for that.She takes the role and makes it her own but fights an impossible uphill battle like casting a wheelchair bound actor as Linford Christie it just wasn't going to happen. Her performance is excellent as is Dominic West who plays her father Lord Richard Croft and the movie clearly has influences from the modern Tomb Raider (Rebooted) games so stays true to much of it's origins. It also plays out like a modern Indiana Jones movie and actually does it quite well.So what's the problem? Poor casting can flatline a movie, Vikanders strong performance can only go so far. She simply isn't Lara Croft and I couldn't get past that, the origin story had been changed (Which I hate) and the whole thing felt like someone hadn't thought it through thoroughly enough.If you're not a fan of the Tomb Raider franchise and like a good old fashioned adventure movie then you may well find yourself blown away by this. If however you are a fan and have expectations you'll likely walk away like me highly frustrated.The Good:Great castVikander really is a great actressLooks great with classic tomb raiding actionThe Bad:Simply not loyal enough to the source materialVikander is awful castingThings I Learnt From This Movie:A thing that is priceless to you can have a price of as little as 8kAlicia Vikander is immortalAbs are a less impressive feat on a skinny person",Tomb Raider
36,The-Sarkologist,Time for a mindless reboot,3,18 March 2018,"I'm sort of wandering how old a movie has to be when they decide that it is time for a remake. Well, I'm actually thinking that it is getting less and less the further we progress because I'm sure that the Angeline Jolie Tomb Raiders were only out a few years ago. In fact, when I first saw the advertisements for this instalment a part of me thought that it was just Angelina reprising her role, only to be rather baffled when I discovered that Lara Croft was actually being played by a completely different actress. In fact, it became quite clear when I watched the preview a second time (as I wasn't really paying attention the first time I saw it) that I realised it was a reboot.
 Honestly, I'm not all that sure why it is I go and watch these movies because as it turned out this one was pretty bad. Well, not really, but I certainly wasn't able to get into it. I'm sure there are plenty of people out there that really enjoy these films, but all I can say is that it is basically unoriginal. Okay, it is a reboot, and reboots are never original, but then again they never end up being all that successful either, especially when the original was so much better. Actually, I sometimes wonder why Hollywood insists on rebooting and remaking successful films when it is quite clear that it rarely, if ever, works.
 Okay, it has been a while since I've seen the original Lara Croft film, and it also seems that I never got around to writing a review for it either, so it makes it difficult to compare. However, here we start off with Lara as a bicycle courier in London, and she seems to forever be getting herself into trouble. Well, once again it is the story of the abandoned child since her father went off on an adventure seven years ago and is now presumed dead. So, Lara decides that she might as well sign the papers, only to discover a piece to a puzzle that sends her on a round the world adventure.
 As I said, it is difficult to compare the two films since in this one it seems as if she is a bit of a newbie when it comes to adventuring, and it is the hunting down her father plotline (which a part of me believes that was the original film as well). In a way, I thought that maybe she would have been a bit more skilful, though I guess that would make it a little unrealistic as it is also supposed to be a coming of age type of film, and in another sense a passing on the baton.
 There were a few interesting plot points as well, namely because it deals with a legendary Japanese queen known as the Death Queen, and we are all led to believe that she is an evil sorceress who was banished to an island and imprisoned in a tomb because she was, well, so evil. However, the hint is dropped that legends aren't always what they seem to be, though that does not necessarily mean that they are completely false. In fact the truth behind the legend may be much more fantastic.
 Still, this is probably not a film that I would be going out of my way to recommend. It was okay, but in the end nothing that really stands out. I guess it is probably more like one of those mindless films that you watch when you really don't want to think, and have basically watched all of the Indiana Jones films to death, but still want something that is of the same style. Sure, Indiana Jones is just way too hard to beat, sometimes it is good to have something that is a little different (though you generally know what is going to happen at the end). I should mention that they have left the film open to a sequel.",Tomb Raider

I honestly wasn't really interested in seeing this film, but since the new 'Lion King' impressed me so much - also a film I didn't really want to see - I decided to give 'Tomb Raider' the benefit of the doubt.If it wasn't for the original 'Tomb Raider' starring Angelina Jolie back in 2001, I might have enjoyed this film more. Sadly, though, I did not like this film. The characters were cliched and for most part annoying because they never thought their plans through before implementing them. Although Alicia Vikander did a good job as Lara Croft, she didn't really sold the character to me - not nearly as good as Jolie did.I also didn't enjoy the story that much. From the opening moments, it was cliche after cliche. When the adventure started, it was one unbelievable event after the next - purely for sensation and to push stunts and adventure to the next level, unfortunately to the point where it became ridiculous more often than not. I also didn't find the whole story surrounding Lara's dad interesting. (Now you see me, now you don't. Now I'm dead, now I'm not, now I am...) Pity I didn't enjoy the film (that much), because it's clear they really tried, and I thoroughly enjoyed director Roar Uthaug's previous film 'The Wave', which happens to be among my favorite films. (On a more positive note: the final act inside the tomb wasn't bad, and almost redeemed the film, hence a higher rating than I might have given).Would I watch it again?

The plot was interesting and the direction which was made by Roar Uthaug was good and made even better. The interpretation of Alicia Vikander who played as Lara Croft was good and I believe she fitted very well on the role. Another interpretations that has to be mentioned was Dominic West's who played as Lord Richard Croft and he was also very good.

41,cruise01,"Tomb Raider is exciting, action packed, and Alicia Vikander is stunning as Lara Croft.",8,17 March 2018,"Tomb Raider (4 out of 5 stars).Tomb Raider is an action adventure film that is based on the 2013 video game reboot. And also a reboot to the earlier Tomb Raider films that Angelina Jolie starred in. Angelina Jolie Raider films were fun and had a sort of style to it. This Tomb Raider reboot is grounded when it comes to action and we see Lara Croft in her earlier years. She is vulnerable, fearless, and she sure can take hits from bad guys to falling in river rapids and hitting tree branches. Tomb Raider sort of breaks the video game curse when it comes to adaptations. So gamer fans may be somewhat happy with the story following Lara getting stuck on an island searching for Himiko's tomb. The ship crashes from a wild storm, she is captured and escapes from the bad guys who are from an organization called the trinity. She tries to stop the organization from discovering that tomb which can be lethal to the rest of the world. What I like about Tomb Raider? The film does have some gritty intense action. Lara Croft takes her first kill. She does not have weapons when going on in this adventure. She starts with what she can get, such as a bow or a climbing axe. She does take some guys down fighting them. Plus she can take a beating. She escapes through one of the exciting sequence when she is in the river rapids and gets caught on a torn down plane by the waterfall. Which the plane falls with her in it. That scene was thrilling and one that sticks out from the rest. There are a few good action scenes with her fighting guys with her bow or trying to avoid death traps inside the mountain. Alicia Vikander is fantastic as Lara Croft. Myself being a gamer fan of the reboot. I think she was a great choice. She starts with the beginning of the film as a bike courier before getting into trouble. With Ana (Kristin Scott Thomas) wanting Lara to sign for her inheritance after her father (Dominic West) has been missing for several years after searching for Himiko's tomb. Lara decides to follow her fathers footsteps to search for him. Vikander is ruthless, tough, and she doesn't let anything stop her. Walton Goggins as the villain was good too. Sure, his villain character is a bit one dimensional. And Daniel Wu as Lu Ren, the captain of the ship that gets caught with the bad guys with Lara was good too. What I did not like about the film? Being a fan of the game and watching this movie does leave you wanting a little more. Yes, the game is action packed with Lara going through a lot and was exciting to play. But the film does follow the story idea of it with some changes in the climax when they come across Himiko's tomb. I feel like the movie should have more action. I expected a little more from it. The first act of the film follows Lara in London and we learn a little about her. But it starts with a slow pace before she crashes in the island. Then, there are a few action scenes with her fighting, escaping, and trying to get to the tomb and escaping again. Overall, Tomb Raider is a good action film. Cant really compare it to the original movies cause it is a different take with Lara Croft. But this film had some great action sequences. Wish there was a little more action in the film. Alicia Vikander was great. I am excited to see her return for further sequels. The story and concept was close to the game in ways. Director Roar Uthaug did capture a similar scene from game to movie just well and a young ruthless Lara Croft. I recommend seeing Tomb Raider in theatres, if you're a fan of the games or not. Non fans may enjoy the film for its adventure and non stop action.",Tomb Raider

The supporting characters are decent but a rather weak villain.

43,eddie_baggins,The wait for the first great Video Game adaptation continues,5,15 March 2018,"To the surprise of no one, Roar Uthaug's reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise, 17 years on from the initial Angelina Jolie hit, is about as middle of the line as we'd all come to expect, sadly meaning that the wait continues for the first truly great video game adaptation (sorry Resident Evil fans).To be fair and perhaps to be taken as a positive, Tomb Raider isn't irremediably bad, at times it's actually quite a lot of fun and Alicia Vikander makes for a likeable and believable raider of tombs but the biggest problem with Uthaug's big-budgeted feature film is that it takes itself far too seriously (even more so when you take its daft plotline into account) and it often forgets to have fun along the way, meaning that the films brief flirtations with an action thrill ride are trodden over by more prevalent moments of blandness.Considering its source material and in particular its basing around the great 2013 video game reboot of the franchise, Tomb Raider could've been something very special, a modern day female-orientated take on Indiana Jones that mixed in the humour, the action and the supernatural with memorable set-pieces and likeable characters but Uthaug's take is far too po-faced to ever come close to achieving this outside of a neat river escape (taken straight from the aforementioned video-game) and some cool looking puzzle set-pieces.It's a shame that the films greatest set-pieces are so few and far between and it's never a great sign for a film of this ilk when an action set-up involving a bunch of cyclists chasing each other in a game of ""Foxhunting"" is one of the standout set-pieces and one of the films highlights and its especially unfortunate that Vikander's impressively committed turn as Croft is largely wasted on mediocre material.Still not a household name, Vikander's great body of work over the last few years is on show here as the Sweden born Oscar winner throws herself headfirst into the Croft role and creates a likeable and fiercely determined action heroine, in the battle between Jolie and Vikander, you'd say Vikander wins hands down.Her screen presence and physicality elevate Uthaug's film and help make up for the ho-hum support turns of Dominic West and Daniel Wu, while poor old Walton Goggins turn as the films token bad Mathias Vogel is a real waste of the talented performers' skillset and helps add to the ingredients that make Uthaug's film watchable, but so utterly and undeniably bland.Final Say - Too serious for its own good and lacking in genuinely memorable action moments, this visually pleasing update on the Tomb Raider franchise isn't a total bust thanks largely to Vikander but it's mostly a squandering of solid source material and another unfortunate entry into the disappointing video game adaptation library, a library that sadly continues to grow by the year.2 ½ sprouts out of 5",Tomb Raider

It was packed with cliches sure, but the action was there, the CGI were there and they were nice, the story was okay and the performances were good as well.

45,leonblackwood,Not a great reboot!,4,18 August 2018,"Review:
No matter how hard they try, they just can't get this franchise right! The director chose to go in the direction of an Indiana Jones movie, which really didn't work because none of the characters had any charisma, and the various twists throughout the film, were really predictable. I also wasn't that impressed with Alicia Vikander (Lara Croft) because she looked too young to be battling against grown men, and she didn't play the intelligent Indiana role convincingly. Anyway, after the mysterious disappearance of her father, Lord Richard Croft (Dominic West), Lara makes a living as a bike courier, and she is told by her father's partner that if she does not claim her vast inheritance, her father's country estate, Croft Manor will be sold off. Lara reluctantly accepts the deal, and she gains access to a secret chamber in her father's tomb, where she finds a message detailing his research into Himiko, the mythical Queen of Yamatai, who was said to command the power over life and death. Her father tells her to burn all of his works because it can cause harm to the world if it gets in the wrong hands but she decides to follow his journal to try and work out what exactly happened to him. As she has no money, she decides to sell a precious necklace that her father gave her, so she can go to Hong Kong and begin her search. She hires Lu Ren, who's a captain of a ship, and also lost his father while he was travelling with Richard, and they head off to the Death Sea and the island of Yamatai, which is marked on Richard's maps. After barely managing to abandon ship whilst going through a violent storm, Lara is picked up by Mathias Vogel (Walton Goggins), who is also trying to find Himiko but he wants to use her powers to do bad. Lara soon realises that he has already gone through her bag, and he has found her father's journal, which maps the route to Himiko. He then uses her as a slave, along with some other seamen, including Lu Ren. Now that Mathias knows the correct location of Himiko, they start to make there way there but Lara escapes from Mathias henchmen, and miraculously meets her father in a cave, believe it or not. He tells her that he has stayed on the island to prevent Mathias from finding Himiko, so Lara leaves the cave to try and retrieve the journal that Mathias stole from her. Richard then makes his way to Himiko's tomb but he is captured by Mathias, who threatens to kill him if he doesn't open the tomb. Lara agrees to open the tomb, to save her father, and when they finally get inside, they navigate through a series of booby traps and locate Himiko's coffin. 2 of Mathias's soldiers force open the tomb, and they become infected while they are trying to move her corpse. Images around the tomb reveal that Himiko, who was apparently immune to the virus herself and was a carrier, came to the island voluntarily rather than being forced as the legends imply, sacrificing herself to contain the virus. As Mathias can't take the body, he takes one of her fingers instead. During the confusion, Lara and Richard overpower the remaining soldiers but Mathias escapes, and Richard becomes infected. As Richard knows that there is no way of saving himself, he says that he will blow up the tomb, while Lara tries to stop Mathias. It really does sound more interesting than it really is! None of the characters really stood out, and the plot wasn't that great. The little twist at the end leaves the movie open for a sequel but I won't be rushing to see it. There wasn't much action through the whole film but there's loads of swinging and jumping, just like the game. I'm sure that there are loads of people that will disagree with this review, judging by the profit it made at the box office but I personally lost interest after a while. On the plus side, it did look impressive, and the booby traps made the film intense for a moment but apart from that, I wasn't that impressed. Disappointing! Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Roar Uthaug, whose previous movies have mainly been made for a Norwegian market. For his first major release, I personally think that this task was a bit too much for him because it seemed more like a Mummy/Indiana movie than the beginning of a Tomb Raider saga. He did quite well in the CGI department but I would get another director for the sequel. Budget: $94million

46,TheMovieDiorama,Tomb Raider is as good as any video game adaptation has the right to be.,7,16 March 2018,"This is by far one of the strongest adaptations to what critics love to slam: movies based on video games. I can see why, attempting to succinctly convert a 20-30 hour game into a 2 hour film is difficult where both story and character will inevitably be sacrificed. The same issues arise here, but I can confidently say it's exhilaratingly entertaining. An adaptation of the rebooted game series, a young Lara discovers that her missing father was secretly an archaeologist where he ventured to the forgotten island of Yamatai in search of the supernatural goddess of death Himiko. Lara naively adventures to the Island to seek answers and stop an evil organisation from finding the tomb. This review will always have slight bias. Why? The Tomb Raider franchise is one of my favourites of all time, particularly the rebooted series. And much like last year's 'Ghost in the Shell', I will constantly be at the defence of this adventure flick. A surprisingly faithful adaptation and one that injects a barrage of action shots into the blood stream. Whether it be Lara cycling maniacally through London or solving puzzles before time expires, there is something about harking back to classic adventure films that feels rather nostalgic and fresh simultaneously. This is not a sexualised incarnation of Lara, this is a naive unconfident girl who at first flees for her life to then eventually have her survival instincts kick in. A steady growth in character that Vikander effortlessly displayed. A physically draining performance from her in an attempt to deviate from dramas and enter mainstream blockbusters. It worked. She was absolutely excellent. The supporting cast were all fine however the father daughter relationship with West was conveyed with such conviction that it felt believable. As much as I want to say this film is perfection, there are underlying issues. Extreme rapid pacing, occasional mediocre green screen and an expositional script are detrimental. Yet, my inner fanboy was most pleased and I can only hope we get a sequel.",Tomb Raider

49,Movie_Muse_Reviews,"A fresh and interesting Lara in a predictable, unoriginal early 2000s story",5,12 June 2018,"Hollywood is not giving up on ""Tomb Raider."" Oscar-winner Alicia Vikander dons Lara Croft's signature shorts and tank top in this reboot of the popular video game franchise that was abandoned in the early 2000s by Paramount Pictures when its second Angelina Jolie-led effort flopped. Despite 15 years and new minds at MGM and Warner Bros. taking over, the new ""Tomb Raider"" still feels an awful lot like a 2000s movie.Based on the 2013 video game reboot of the franchise, ""Tomb Raider"" is a Lara Croft origin story. The approach to revive the character feels extremely similar to the ""reboot"" MGM did with the ""James Bond"" films when Daniel Craig came aboard - make it grittier and character-focused.That's where ""Tomb Raider"" does succeed. Vikander gives Croft a total makeover from tall, busty sex-appeal action hero to petite, scrappy, tough and independent heroine. Vikander makes Lara infinitely more human, taking cues from some of the best action hero performances by struggling and experiencing pain and anguish. She's just working in an extremely stale, cliché story.Seven years after her father's (Dominic West) disappearance, Lara is living a troubled life, scraping by as a mail courier and still unable to accept her father's death. Right as she's about to sign the papers acknowledging his death in absentia, she receives a clue that leads her to the lost Japanese island where he went missing while in search of the tomb of an ancient Japanese queen with supernatural powers, and she goes there looking for answers.Nothing in ""Tomb Raider"" wasn't covered by ""Indiana Jones,"" ""The Mummy"" or even ""National Treasure"" franchise and that's where it fizzles. The riddle- and puzzle-solving, discovering hidden sites, and power struggles over finding the power at the center of it all - these are all tropes of other movie franchises that have gone out of style. Although they are true to the ""Tomb Raider"" games and there's a reason so many movies have used them, it's a decade later and story writers Geneva Robertson-Dworet (who also wrote the screenplay) and Evan Daugherty (""Snow White and the Huntsman"") bring nothing new to the mix. Even the much-improved handling of Lara comes with a too-familiar daddy-issues back story.Norwegian director Roar Uthaug does a capable job bringing some grit instead of shiny, stylized video game action to this series, though the script really pushes the extent to which we can believe Lara can survive the jumps, falls and bruises. Generally, however, the action is suspenseful and watchable and not at all the issue.Despite being an origin story, the film generates not much more than indifference toward the plot and Lara's personal journey. Her street life and decision to journey out in search of closure is constructed on hollow clichés and we can sniff out exactly the way her story will turn out, turning her into the classic Lara fans know and love by the film's end. Even the most compelling performance by an Oscar-winning actress is only so interesting when the story deposits her into old, well-worn situations.The good news is that I could watch Vikander's Lara Croft again in a better, more original story, but it doesn't seem like the box office numbers will give her the chance.~Steven CThanks for reading!

50,southdavid,Plot Raider,5,4 April 2018,"In this rebooted version of the video game adaptation, Lara Croft is a (presumably) orphaned young woman, who is scraping together a living delivering food around London having rebelled against her privileged upbringing following the disappearance of her adventurer father. Her interested piqued by a puzzle box she begins her adventure to discover what happened to her father, and what treasures exist on a mysterious island off the coast of Japan. If asked to some up this adaptation in one word, I'd choose ... tolerable. There are some aspects that I do like. I like Alicia Vikander as Lara Croft, she's engaging and committed to the role, even if her accent veers wildly all over the place. The film is competently shot and edited and the distant locales look nice. But the films plot and set pieces have all been done before, and better, in other movies. It steals liberally from the ""Indiana Jones"" series, from ""The Mummy"" amongst others. There is a small twist at the end which is so jaw droppingly obvious, it feels like a personal insult when they actually reveal it. Walton Goggins too is poor as the films antagonist, a thinly drawn character that occasionally declares his desire to go home to his family as his motivation, but still kills for no real reason and, towards the end of the film, insists on continuing with his employer's plan, even though it's clearly not the choice he should be making. It's better than the Angelina Jolie films, but that's damning with faint praise.",Tomb Raider

But what could be in the mysterious passage. And will she find het missing father played by Dominic West.I don't know whether anyone would agree with me or not but Angelina Jolie was better as the title charcther back in 2001's Lara Croft:Tomb Raider.I found this version very hard to follow as it was all over the place.If you want my advice stick to the 2001 and 2003 of Lara Croft Tomb Raider and it's sequel.,Tomb Raider
52,jtindahouse,A little underwhelming,6,20 August 2018,"Ironically in 'Tomb Raider' they got the hard part right and messed up the easy part. The hard part in my opinion was correctly casting 'Lara Croft'. To follow in the shoes of a peak-of-her-powers Angelina Jolie is no easy feat. They pulled that off though by finding Alicia Vikander who was excellent in this film. The part they messed up though, and why this is such a bland experience, was they just didn't give her anything interesting to do. The film starts off fun. The character introductions are clever, interesting and get you amped for what is to come. Then when the actual adventure begins the entire film stalls and never manages to start up again. The location was mildly interesting, but for almost the entire film to be set on the one island just felt lazy and uncreative - especially with a runtime near 2 hours. Also the villain was about as dull as they come.Vikander is what saves this from being a total misfire though. She has the look, the charisma and the sexiness to pull off the character with ease. There was a bit of controversy with the films poster and her abnormally long neck in it. I couldn't help but notice that she does have a very long neck in reality, but the poster was still taking things a bit far clearly. I certainly couldn't recommend this as a film to rush out and see because it is so uninspiring and middle of the road. It's not terrible, it just never dares to be great.",Tomb Raider

Alicia Vikander really makes the character of Lara Croft her own, I mean I really liked the way she played her, hope she'll do more in the future.

If I recall correctly, there have been 2 Lara Croft, Tomb Raider movies-with Angelina Jolie starring-back in 2001 & 2003. This is a nice reboot, starring Alicia as Lara and it takes place when she is about 21, making deliveries on her bicycle and taking kick boxing lessons on the side-she is struggling to pay bills. Her father, Dominic, disappeared about 7 years earlier and she is being pressured into signing her father's death certificate and inherit her father's billions but she refuses to believe he is dead-I don't know about you but I think after 7 years, I could sign it. You can always give the money back if dear old dad was to show up. Anyway, she goes looking for Dominic, who was looking for a lost tomb of a sorceress when he disappeared, and she meets Daniel, a man with similar troubles-his father gave Dominic a boat ride and he disappeared too. Walton places the bad guy that has been looking for the tomb a long time and has his own plans for the contents of the tomb. Alicia got into great shape and does most of her own stunts, which mostly includes falling and dangling from high places, such as cliffs, caves and bridges and getting into lots of fights-I guess those kick boxing classes really paid off. You also get to see where she acquires her 2 guns, which Angelina was fond of using quite often.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for action, violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 58 minutes.

57,GiraffeDoor,Some movies just don't deserve any thought put into their heading.,4,21 May 2020,"When watching a reboot you have the choice of watching in terms of being a revival of what is being rebooted or simply just taking it on its own terms. I usually prefer the latter to try and get the most I can out of it but let's take a moment to think about the Tomb Raider franchise.I don't claim to be intimately familiar with these games but everyone basically knows them and seems to have played at least part of least one, at least in passing.Lara Croft is supposed to an impressive, mature woman in the prime of her life. But instead, they gave us this debutante who can barely hold her own in amateur sparring. It's not that I don't like underdog protagonists but they chose a bad moment to try one. Vikander is horrifically miscast as gaming's most iconic female. Not only does her accent keep flicking between each side of the Atlantic and even when she can pick a side, she can't make up her mind whether to use RP or that generic estuary English that is not the Croft we all know. And this is before we get to the insufferable smugness in her facial expressions and the tedious dryness in everything she says and does. One more thing: I don't like to think I am shallow person, or that I don't principally focus on things like personality and motivations when it comes to judging a character but for the idiot who cast Vickander in this role, the real issue is...well...more like a couple of problems if you know what I mean. She is not an actress I have any interest in seeing in other projects.So this movie doesn't respect its base source, let alone understand it. But maybe there's a different movie in there we can enjoy? The answer is no. Not only is Lara bland as rice as a heroine, the story feels more like the fictional movie within an episode of a cartoon. It's the generic action adventure in the jungle and at times it takes forever to get anyway. There are some adequate set pieces but they are few and far between as they devote way more screen time to this emotional journey that is poorly though through and has been a hundred times before a thousand times better. It also appears to be her origin story; she is just starting out. Who wants to see that movie?! If they had called this ""Tomb Raider: Origins"" then I wouldn't feel so cheated.The whole idea of Croft is she has millions so she can afford to pay the best of the best to train her and has the time to train. She has no problems except how to possibly fill her time now she has probably experienced every luxury and now turns to being the explorer we all wish we were if we didn't fear our own death so much. This girl refuses to accept her inheritance for reasons not even Freud could fathom beyond ""because movie"". Her motivations are abstract and petty and make the whole starting point of the movie just manufactured conflict. The whole movie is basically preventable issues and manufactured problems.I appreciate that Tomb Raider was very much a gamer's game and didn't really have the story and character development we expect from the silver screen and so to produce a Tomb Raider movie is not going to just be live action cut-scenes but this is just an embarrassing movie that barely makes and doesn't seem to understand what it is or how to make the best of what little it has.It is hard to watch this is one sitting. I am not emotionally invested in the characters, the actiony parts have no pizzazz and you are nearly as the end before any Tombs get raided. And although I don't want to spoil anything, the climax it seems to be promising from the start is totally just a carrot on a stick.Apparently Vickander is a fan of the original game. Well, congratulations, you're part of the worst thing to happen to the franchize. I hear Kristen Stewart could have been Lara. How cool would that have been?! But I'm glad she didn't have to get her finger prints on this.A movie on this series sounds brilliant on paper but they've had three now and they all just seem like generic adventure movies that never gave me the sense of infinite badassdom the games did.This movie ticked me off big time, especially just before the credits.",Tomb Raider
58,alindsay-al,An average action film,5,15 March 2018,"After playing the fantastic tomb raider game from a few years ago I was so excited for the possibility of a film close to that so I was really excited for this tomb raider film and this is a very disappointing film. The premise sees a girl with little direction go on a hunt to a mysterious island in search of her father. Alicia vikander plays lara croft in this film and she is great in this film, she really encapsulated the tomb raider I wanted to see. Her physique allowed her to be believable in all her action scenes and as this action film, she was also a layered, strong character that the audience could easily root for. Daniel wu plays an ally of crofts and even though he doesn't stand out I think he did a good job in the film, there chemistry together was entertaining. Dominic west plays Lara's father in the film and he does a very good job, I bought the flashbacks scenes and the relationship between father and daughter was well done here. Walter goggins plays the villain in this film and he came across as really bland, there was a good character there but the writing just doesn't do enough to make you understand what his motivations are or why we should care. The story in the film has a great coming of age story here as lara really develops alot In this film and it is great to see, but this film doesn't take a lot from the game's plot and it is hard to get engaged in the overall plot due to its basic nature. The script is easily the worst part of the film, the drama just doesn't hit enough to add depth to more of the characters when it was really needed especially with the villain. Also the humour isn't done well and comes across as awkward and like it doesn't fit into the film. The style of the film is what is borrowed the most from the game and most of the time this film looks great with luscious backgrounds and well done action situations. Though there are times where the CGI is really noticeable and it took me out of the situations that was going on. Overall this film had so much potential and at times it succeeds but overall it just doesn't hit the heights that it should.",Tomb Raider
59,iquine,"Medium Action, Medium Entertainment; Room For Improvement",5,4 October 2018,"(Flash Review)Overall, this is a fairly generic treasure hunting action movie with a couple actual tense scenes. It seemed to lack charm as the villains were stereotypical and Lara's rebooted character, while tough and no push over, lacked authentic depth. Lara goes out in search of her long lost father, a renowned adventurer, as she refuses to conform to a normal life as her family lineage would imply. Thus she travels to an island off of Hong Kong, her father's last known location to complete his final expedition. Of course she is tailed by treasure seekers and along the way quickly solves some elaborate ancient puzzles. Perhaps there wasn't enough character background, aside from her father's legacy, that would lead you to believe she'd just know how to solve all these puzzles or that she'd be so tough since the film opens with her getting beaten in a ringed fighting match and crashing while biking through the city. Overall, it was mildly entertaining, some head scratching physical ability moments and I wish I could remember more about Angelina Jolie's character to compare but Vikander seemed more down to earth and realistic.",Tomb Raider

Both films did well and solidified Angelina Jolie as an action star at the time. Now the character has been brought back to film and the potential same trajectory for its star Alicia Vikander. Norwegian director Roar Uthaug helms this outing and does a wonderful job fulfilling the promise that was on display in his last film Norway's THE WAVE. The film opens with Lara as a small child spending time with her father Richard (Dominic West) before he heads out on his latest adventure. Fast forward to the present and Lara now finds herself strapped for cash, working as a bicycle delivery person and racing the city streets for extra cash to live on. Caught by police she's rescued by the woman now in charge of the day to day operations of Croft Industries, Ana (Kristin Scott Thomas).Ana wants Lara to settle down and take on the responsibilities that her father left her. If she fails to do so the entire company, including their estate, will be sold off. But even after 7 years Lara is unwilling to believe her father is dead. Meeting with the company lawyer Mr. Yaffe (Derek Jacobi) he presents her with a Japanese box puzzle her father left her before she signs the paper. Solving the puzzle she finds a note left just to her and follows the clues in it to a secret sanctuary her father kept on their property.Inside she discovers an abundance of charts, maps, notes and books all that were used by her father in an attempt to discover the tomb of Himiko, a mythical queen who was said to have made the rivers run red with blood before her own soldiers captured her and imprisoned her in a tomb hidden on an uncharted island. He also leaves behind a video tape telling her to destroy all of his research. Knowing this is where her father went she follows in his footsteps hoping to find him ignoring his request.Locating the son of the man who charted his ship for her father, the pair set off to follow his direction to the island that he found. The ship is lost at sea during a storm but fortunately near the island they were seeking. Knocked unconscious Lara wakes to find herself the captive of Mathias Vogel (Walton Goggins) who works for Trinity, the organization her father wanted to keep the information from. Instead he now possesses the book Richard left behind and the means to locate the tomb. Unless Lara can free herself and stop him first. Like the video game the movies is based on there is plenty of adventure on hand here as well as enough stunts to keep a slew of union members employed. Also like the game the action is combined equally with the puzzles left to be solved by Lara, something she specializes in due to her father's training. This makes for a special character for young girls to admire, a woman who outdoes the men in her life and proves she can be whatever she wants to be, a hero to be admired and emulated. Vikander, who has been moving up slowly with feature turns in a number of films, seems destined for this role. She makes the character of Lara Croft seem more real than ever, a young woman with strong capabilities whose brain is a better asset than her body. Most incarnations of the character have been long on her short shorts and an over-endowed chest. Vikander doesn't rely on these and instead presents the character more as an honest character. She may be athletically minded but not overly so.While watching I was taken back to years ago when I sat down in a dark theater and watched as an archeologists by the name of Indiana Jones was unleashed upon the world. Lara Croft is similar to that character, a female incarnation if you will. By the end of the film you'll be wishing that they continue using the character in more movies. The film is the perfect summer movie, a popcorn munching treat that will keep you entertained from start to finish.",Tomb Raider

I have played all the video games and watched the previous movies with Angelina Jolie. The first one was a little bit shallow while the second one had great pace and was an improvement. This reboot however is easily the best of the three films for numerous reasons.Let's start with the movie's only downside. The first fifteen minutes that are meant to introduce the protagonist and show us her tough life are overtly sentimental. If this were to be a drama, it would blend in nicely but it doesn't quite go along with an adventurous action movie. The movie's final twist is also foreshadowed so obviously in the first fifteen minutes that it almost feels ridiculous. Please take the viewers more seriously.Other than that, Tomb Raider is a stunning experience. The locations look gorgeous. The stormy sea, the mysterious island and the gloomy catacombs are fascinating. The number of traps, riddles and dangers that Lara Croft encounters are as challenging, diversified and intense as in the best video games. The story is closely inspired by the excellent video game that successfully rebooted the franchise five years ago. The special effects are absolutely stunning as this movie is one of the greatest visual experiences I have ever seen on screen. Still, the movie doesn't lift off and keeps a realistic edge thanks to precise camera work and light techniques as well as genuinely exotic locations. The acting performances are great. Antagonist Mathias is a pitiless lunatic, Lara Croft's sidekick is a resilient sailor with an alcohol problem and Lara Croft's father is meandering between cleverness and madness. I really appreciated Alicia Vikander's performance as she portrays a cultivated yet adventurous young woman with a strong moral compass who has to deal with demons of her past, shady family members and arrogant guys who constantly underestimate her. She is much closer to the essence of Lara Croft than Angelina Jolie's character that was rather built upon stereotypical physical appearances. Alicia Vikander's performance is as fresh as the movie itself and the rebooted franchise as it doesn't have anything in common with the quiet, one-dimensional superhero with the big breasts of yore.Fans of the Tomb Raider franchise should really love this movie as it offers everything that makes the video games so outstanding: a brave protagonist with an intellectual side, diversified exotic locations, a series of traps, riddles and dangers, a dangerous antagonist and a few cultural and historic references. The only reasons why this movie didn't get the highest possible grade are the unnecessary opening fifteen minutes and the fact that 2013's Tomb Raider game is even better than the movie. If you have played this game, you have to watch the movie. If you have watched this movie, you have to play the game. It's as simple as this. Enjoy the wold ride!",Tomb Raider
64,davispittman,Surprisingly good,9,7 July 2018,"Judging from the reviews of the Angelina Jolie Lara Croft films, ones that i have not seen, i thought this one would just be a cheap rehashing of those. Now having seen it, I can say that I was wrong. Tomb Raider is a very effective, well made action film. Alicia Vikander does well in the lead role of Lara. She gives the character depth and is a good fit. I also really liked Dominic West here, he did well as Lara's father. The story was interesting enough to keep one's attention till the end. The special effects are top notch, and the sound is some of the best I've heard. I loved the visuals and sound effects. This is definitely one to watch on Blu-ray and with surround sound. This film is not just another generic action romp, it has heart and you can tell the filmmakers were trying to bring a fresh take to the Lara Craft franchise. I really hope we get a second one, and I can't imagine we won't, with the way in which the film ends.",Tomb Raider
65,Pairic,Lara Croft Creation Myth Is A Success.,8,13 March 2018,"Tomb Raider: A creation myth film for Lara Croft (Alicia Vikander), her father Richard (Dominic West) has been missing for seven years and Lara is reluctant to sign papers confirming hiss death and thereby claim her inheritance. She works as a bike courier confirming all of our prejudices about their dangerous behaviour on the roads and footpaths, she is also a kickboxer, not always winning. Her former guardian (Kristin Scott-Thomas) finally persuades her to sign but in her solicitor's (Derek Jacobi) office, she comes across a clue which sends her back to the family crypt without signing. In the crypt she discovers her fathers secret workshop and a video of her dad which lets her know that he has gone in search of the island tomb of an ancient Japanese Queen whose touch resulted in death. In Hong Kong Lara locates the son (Daniel Wu) of the skipper who brought Richard to the secret island. Shipwrecked on the island they are captured by the villainous Vogel (Walter Goggins) who is working on behalf of the evil cabal Trinity (probably the Provost and fellows of Trinity College, Dublin) to locate the Queen's tomb and give them control over supernatural forces.Alicia Vikander's slim athletic build is just right for the character she portrays: an ultra-fit young woman who is a skilled archer but not a super-hero. She swings through the air on hooks, lianas, escapes from a rusty wrecked plane with a parachute. After killing her first baddie and initial shock, she suffers no more qualms about letting those arrows sink home into human flesh. Daniel Wu is a sidekick but has his own agenda to avenge his fathers death. Goggins is as evil as an SS camp guard as he shoots a slave-worker who is too ill to work.There are underground passages, traps, puzzles to solve, collapsing floors, gasp to be bridged or jumped over. Even some original death dealing devices guard the inner reaches of the Queen's Tomb. This reboot of Lara Croft is based on the 1913 game and is a success. My only caveat is that it is unsophisticated in parts and this may have been due to desire to appeal to a young gamer audience. Still, welcome back Lara Croft. 8/10.",Tomb Raider
66,RavenGlamDVDCollector,Alicia all the way,7,6 November 2019,"Forget what everybody else is saying. In a nutshell, Alicia Vikander is so absolutely perfect, everything that is needed to pull this off. It's the supporting cast that falls flat. That's why there are so many low scores here.",Tomb Raider
67,TdSmth5,Lara Croft is dull,4,10 June 2018,"Both this incarnation of Lara and the movies itself are plain dull. Lara is a kickboxer/bike-deliveryperson who is called to sign some papers now that her dad has gone missing. But before she signs she's given some Asian version of the Lament configuration. Once she opens it she finds some secret message from her dad which takes her to his lair where he has all his research. He's after the tomb of some Japanese empress as we learn in voice overs from the intro. That takes Lara to Hong Kong and eventually to the dangerous islands. Right away she meets her dad's/her nemesis who is also after the tomb and is blowing up half the island to find it. Lara escapes and just happens to run into her half mad dad. Now they all join forces and find the tomb outwitting all the traps and riddles but what's inside they did didn't expect. Now they have to make it back out alive.The story itself isn't half bad, but this movie is too long and full of annoying action. Annoying because it gets tedious quickly and because I just can't buy Alicia Vikander as the action heroine. Sorry. This girl looks too unremarkable, her acting is, well, not there, she looks and sounds the same in all her roles, and her British accent is too forced. How she ever became the darling of the Hollywood big shots who knows. Direction is ok I guess, now that it is clear that anyone can ""direct"" greenscreen CGI big budget movies, and Hollywood sure looks in everyone corner of the world, except the US of course, to find someone and reward them with million dollar salaries to oversee generic stuff like Tomb Raider. I didn't connect with this Lara, or the movie itself. It's good to see Walton Goggins in a bigger role in a bigger movie though. Most insufferable is the constant junk orchestrated music accompanying the frequent action set-pieces. Perhaps teens who haven't seen a lot of action films might find this interested, for the rest of us, Tomb Raider offers little.",Tomb Raider
68,s3276169,I never liked the idea to start with.....,5,3 May 2018,"I never really liked the Tomb Raider concept. It was too much a sad retread of the vastly more enjoyable Indiana Jones series of films. The second iteration is better than the first but still fails to spark the kind of enthusiasm I felt for good ol Indy. I think one of the key shortfalls is this series not really grounded upon anything that conjures up a sense of nostalgia. Indiana Jones worked because it tapped into that colourful, romantic era of early exploration of tombs and catacombs, with a neat Casa Balanca style twist.Tomb Raider by contrast, uses a contemporary setting that just does not have a heritage to draw upon. Worse still Lara Croft is everything Indy is not. An entitled kid who gets to play at life rather than someone who has earned their stripes the hard way. She's not really a battler and as such not really all that interesting.The new film tries to address this imbalance by making Lara appear more an ""every man"" or person (if you like). Nonetheless it really doesn't work as inevitably she comes full circle and ends up back in the shallow toffee nosed environment that created her. On the upside the action scenes are well done but again given all the baggage this franchise comes with I would have thought it best be left on the shelf or in the catacombs or whatever. 5/10 from me.",Tomb Raider
69,peterp-450-298716,Don't sulk Lara ... you're an adventuress.,6,5 July 2018,"""Vogel can't find the tomb without me,
and since I'm dead and...
since you've burned the rest of my research,
he will never find it.""I was actually looking forward to watching this new version of ""Tomb Raider"". Not only because I had a lot of fun with the PC game years ago (and amazed by the used graphics in those days). And not because Lara Croft was a hot and good looking video game character. Equipped with a couple of huge boobs, wearing tight hotpants and she used to make those horny little cries whenever she bumped into something. No wonder she had a large male fanbase. But also because I appreciated the film with Angelina Jolie. And at the same time, I was curious how her successor Alicia Vikander would handle it. And to be honest, that was the biggest letdown of the film for me. Not that Vikander acted badly (Good acting isn't really a requirement when playing a part in Tomb Raider. Right?). She just looked like an innocent teenager who first got slapped around during kickboxing and has fun with a chasing-game on her bike. And before you know it, she's traveling to Asia to follow a trail that leads her to a place where her father supposedly deceased and turns into some kind of ass-kicking female action-hero.So they got rid of the sensuality and the over-the-top femininity. Don't get me wrong. I don't think it's really necessary, of course. But there should be a decent alternative instead. An intriguing and fascinating story, for example. Ultimately it's a female version of ""Indiana Jones"". But this time they've removed the facet of humor and replaced it with serious drama. Once Lara and her companion Lu Ren (Daniel Wu) arrive on the island, it's just Lara who continuously runs, jumps, dives, fights and tries to survive. It wasn't really exciting. And at certain times it seemed as if Lara possessed superhuman powers. I'm sure Wonder Woman would be jealous.Perhaps it was intentionally done to present Lara Croft in this film as more serious and humane. For example, there's this dilemma about her signing some contracts which are important for the continued existence of ""Croft Holdings"". Particularly because signing these documents is actually a confirmation that Lara's father is really dead. Something Lara stubbornly denies since she's convinced he's still alive. But is a movie like ""Tomb Raider"" suitable for using such profoundly human themes? Not for me. I'm not waiting for that when I watch this type of movie. I want adventure and mysticism. A battle for life and death between heroes and ""the bad guys"". A trip through jungles and caves full of booby traps and difficult puzzles to solve. And that's the positive side of this film. The film is crammed with (sometimes slightly exaggerated) action scenes and riddles. And that corresponds to what one could experience in the PC game""Tomb Raider"" certainly isn't bad but didn't really impress me. This flick is perfect for a relaxing movie night. Even though the character Lara Croft has become immensely popular over the years thanks to the pioneering games from the 90s and the lascivious performance by Angelina Jolie, this film doesn't succeed in eliciting that same feeling. This shows once again that making a movie of a video game certainly isn't an easy task.",Tomb Raider
70,aidanratesmovies,The Best Video Game Film Ever Made (As of 2018),8,23 March 2019,"There is no reason why the set up of this film should be as good as it is, which makes the second act of this film far more disappointing. The film in itself is quite good, not great, but good, and knows how to do that just right. As it begins, its entertaining, it's fun, and it's everything we have ever wanted in a video game movie, until the actual plot comes into play however. Walton Goggins as the film's villain is ultimately where it is weighed down, as well as the whole plot revolving around him. However disappointing this may be though, Alicia Vikander is here and has come to stay. Vikander plays the part of Lara Croft expertly and finds herself being quite possible most, if not all, of the life force dragging this movie forward. Maybe they can do better in the sequel, but until then, what we have now is certainly not half-bad.
My Rating: 8.5/10",Tomb Raider
71,questl-18592,Lame Raider,6,28 October 2020,"If ever there was a movie elevated purely on the strength of a couple performances. Tomb Raider (2018) is a terribly mediocre movie, to the point that I'm realizing now, a few days after watching it, nothing really stands out in my head except for Vikander and Goggins. I loved the portrayal of Croft in this, she seems human rather than whatever was going on in the Jolie movies. She struggles and learns, grows and evolves over the course of the movie in a way that was really satisfying. Then there's Goggins as this cultish leader and he totally pulls it off in a way that had me captivated whenever he was on screen.Take those two performances away and we get a completely serviceable if forgettable movie that seems destined to be lost to the graveyard of daytime television movies. This is really a shame because it's not bad and I think this could really make for the beginning of a promising franchise. I'd be more than happy to see Vikander step back into the role and really grow and develop this character. Until then, this is good for background noise but not a whole lot more than that.",Tomb Raider
72,adamjohns-42575,Swing and a miss.,3,27 July 2020,"It is such a shame that this film was so bad, because I don't think they've really given the new girl a chance.
The story was not very good and the editing was appalling. Why would you make such obvious cuts when things are getting a bit gory? Just film it from a different angle or further away?
I think Miss Vikander could make a very good Lara if she is given the right script, director and editor, but this just let her down.
There are large chunks missing and it's difficult to understand where she's suddenly got all of her information from, because although the back story took ages to get through, it didn't really show what she'd been up to since Daddy left home! And I don't know what it is, but Dominic West really gets on my nerves lately. His role here didn't help to endear him to me further.
I can only hope that now the establishment of a new Lara and her beginnings has been covered, that the next instalment will do better, but until then I will definitely be sticking to Angelina, who will always be my Croft. I'm not a gamer though and I've never even played it once, so maybe I'm wrong?",Tomb Raider

75,rgkarim,Vikander Vitaly,8,16 March 2018,"A video game legacy that swept the shelves in the age of PlayStation was only the start of this legendary series. Growing so big to inspire a first movie series, the Tomb Raider adventures continue to sneak itself into the mix of modern relevance in the video game/movie world. And this weekend, a group of friends and I check out the reboot of the film series with Tomb Raider, I know such a unique title. Trading Angelina Jolie for Alicia Vikander, Sony and Square Enix hopes for a revival to boost their future sales for projects to come. Will it work? Robbie K back to bring you another review on the latest Silver Screen stories: LIKES:Alicia Vikander: Jolie had her own flare, but Vikander brings the modern Lara tone to full life with an independent edge and a devil may care attitude. She portrays the poster child girl power explorer this age calls for, but manages to keep the soft core beneath the hard exterior that is a relatable weakness. Vikander's abilities to display all the emotions are admirable, and she crafted a Croft that was very enjoyable to go on this journey with, and yes, she is a role model for girls/women everywhere, perhaps enough to motivate some archery. The Latter Part of The Story: The movie's second act is when the quality starts to come in, managing to tie the elements set up in the first part and give it a video game like twist. Lara's fight in the wild against Trinity's tyranny is a semi-suspenseful adventure that you are looking for. Integrating action brawn with puzzle-solving brains, the trials on the island are certainly the most exciting part of the movie, (perhaps in an homage to Indiana Jones to which it copies much from). Regardless, this adventure part brings the emotion to full boil, while keeping the story grounded and evolving the character. It works quite well for the start of the series, and one I look forward to seeing grow if they do it right. The Action and Stunts: If you're a gamer, you know that Tomb Raider is not just puzzle solving, and exploration, but also a little action into the mix. This film integrates that component as well, just in more versatile ways than you might expect. A few chase scenes hold impressive speed and acrobatics to get the momentum going, eventually transitioning into Lara vs. the elements. Soon Lara is wielding primitive weapons against big bad cronies that feels like something out of the Hunger Games we oh so love. It's not the most exciting/overbearing, but it goes with the theme of exploration this movie was aiming for, which most likely is why the story didn't suffer too much. DISLIKES:More suspense: In the games, you get caught up in life and death situations that put your skills and stamina to the extreme. This installment had moments that teased at this, but they didn't quite have the design the games do. Lara's challenges were a little short live, and had they been extended could have given us a couple of climactic battles/stunts to really seal the adventure's thrills. Half of my group appreciated the tameness, but others would have liked the mercenaries or traps to have a little more bite. The CGI: Another mixed bag of quality, Tomb Raider's visuals are decent for the most part. The cinematography of the various cities is dynamic, and the island's jungles hold the wild atmosphere that they wanted. When the computer work comes in, they do a decent job creating storms and rusting planes that seemingly blend in with the real-world props in store and become a fun interactive, obstacle course for her to play in. Once the temple starts to appear though, the artificial images start to become obvious, going from slightly fake, to unbelievably cheesy. Given the video game, high-definition graphics, the movie should have been able to copy the magic and give us a little more impressive visualization, especially during the great climb. The First Part of The Story: What we all agreed on though, was how the first part of the story was seemingly out of place in the whole grand scheme of the story. While not only slow, the opening half an hour has some out of place scenes whose only connection is to show off that she is poor and missing her father. The stunts, while impressive, are just not necessary (though a cool show off of girl power), and only extended the movie to large proportions. The comedy scene is cute, a good nod to British humor, but once more sorely sticks out into this awkward mash that is just not relevant to the story. If you stick with the movie past the opening, you are okay, but don't expect to be captivated by the opening. The Sidekick: Finally, the side kick played by Daniel Wu was a decent character, but sadly I didn't think he was utilized the most he could have. The into The Badlands star is known for bringing martial arts and steely stunts with a dynamic and engaging character. He sorts of reaches those proportions in this movie, but then fades to a few fleeting shots of waiting while Lara takes point for a large chunk of story. I would have liked to see him a little more engaged in the struggles and dynamics of the story to make for an interesting team dynamic this movie could have used. The VERDICT: Overall, Tomb Raider is an adventure the trailers mostly promised, bringing the expeditions into the jungle with gusto and having a leading lady to reboot the series with. Although that first act is not the strongest, or most relevant, opening, the second half of the show is ready to pick up the pieces and infuse excitement. Still, the CGI and story needed some polishing to achieve the goal of being a thriller and sending chills through your body. The movie is indeed a video game cinematic hybrid, with tons of nods to video game physics, but Square Enix needs to take the next installment up a level to have a chance of staying alive in the theaters. My scores are:Action/Adventure: 8.0 
Movie Overall: 7.0",Tomb Raider

It follows the same plot where the world needs saving from the supernatural and it is also up to some underdog outside their comfort zone. Add to the it the old overused part about having a father who disappeared when they were young. As soon as you hear it you know the heroine or hero will be reunited with their parent at some point. This makes it a very passable and average film that should go straight to DVD or be made for TV. You could easily multitask while watching this film because there's not much to follow. You know the bad guys will lose and the world will be saved. I haven't watched the older film series with Angelina Jolie but I think it might have been more interesting and engaging.

78,eric262003,Strong Action In Spite of the Overly Used CGI,8,24 November 2019,"In this reboot of the of the classic video game series and the movie adaptations in the early 2000's starring Angelina Jolie, Alicia Vikander steps into Jolie's shoes as the iconic Lara Croft as she goes into incredible lengths of courage and strength in an effort to rescue her father who went on a mission seven years and is presumably dead, only to discover that he has been stranded on an island in Japan in search of and ancient Queen holding a secret that could change the depths of humanity.Unlike the early films in the Jolie era, this reboot of ""Tomb Raider"" has more of the feeling of an origin story as we see Croft riding around on her bicycle trying to make ends meet by working as a delivery girl. You would think that someone who is the wealthy daughter of a rich and famous archaeologist Lord Richard Croft (Dominic West) would hold a position higher or a better job than just making deliveries by bicycle? Well she's not just going to inherit her father's wealth, just like that. She's too proud and independent to take advantage just because she's born in with a silver spoon in her mouth. Plus she still has that feeling inside that he's still alive and is searching for an important tomb of an ancient Queen off the coast of Japan. Lara was eventually called upon by one of Richard's close associates Ana Miller (Kristen Scott-Thomas) who wants her to take his inheritance, however she stumbles across his research and makes it her mission to track him down and bring him home.The similarities between the 2001 and 2003 adaptations of ""Tomb Raider"" and this reboot is that it though it is very exuberant in it's delivery, it's still a familiar story with familiar narratives that stands on its own legs. But the big difference here is that the story is much more serious and more focused which is great because even though I like a bit of humour in adventure films, at least we can see that this reboot is not falling under the depths of self-parody. It might not be settling to some viewers that there is a myriad of emotional drama that lies within the father-daughter relationship between Richard and Lara. But if you're a fan of films that are rich in character development, you might be pleased because the flashbacks from Lara's past relationship with her father adds greater purpose as to why Lara's risking her life to rescue her father. It makes each of the characters more human and less like video game characters provided in the assumption that the script is leaning towards real characters contrary to video game characters come to life.For those who couldn't care less about humanized characters and want action, look no further. There's plenty that delivers that pay great homage towards other adventure themed movie franchises like Indiana Jones and National Treasure and all the puzzle solving, bad guy fighting, putting one's life in danger scenarios all come to life here to keep the action junkie entertaining. Aside from the energy and entertainment, there are some flaws as well. The first being that unlike the ""Tomb Raider"" films in the early 2000's, this reboot depends way too much on CGI making the fight scenes too superficial and then falls under the spell of starting to look more like a video game come to life. And sure it could've went the same direction of Indiana Jones by having Lara do a little globetrotting, I think it's fine that the setting of this movie is situated on the Japanese island right until the finale.Performance wise, hats off to Alicia Vikander who looked the part and performed the part of Lara Croft quite well. Vikander won the Oscar role in the 2015 movie ""The Danish Girl"" and was a Golden Globe nominee in her performance as a cyborg in 2014's ""Ex Machina"" shows she is versatile performer capable of tackling any roles that's given to her. her fighting ability actually compliments nicely to her emotional range she challenges in her role.""Tomb Raider"" surely bring human realism to the movie by creating a character strong in human emotions, while proving great fight scenes and plenty of adventures ahead, though the CGI can at times be a bit of overkill. And sure the script is quite cliched, there is still plenty of fun and entertainment to keep its audience satisfied and never once does it take itself as a parody.",Tomb Raider

But the story was alright & was simple enough. The actress wasn't too bad, but the look of the actress could've been improved a lot more! I mean, come on!

81,moviexclusive,"There is life yet in this Tomb Raider, but not quite enough in Lara Croft to transform this former geekboy's wet dream into an icon of feminist independence",6,8 March 2018,"Unlike say Wonder Woman, Lara Croft was less an icon of feminist empowerment than a geekboy's wet dream, and as sexist as it sounds, the female English archaeologist has her place in pop culture as much because of her physical assets as her intelligence and athleticism. Yet to emphasise the former in this day and age would have been utterly anachronistic, which also explains why his big-screen reboot has opted for the critically lauded actress from 'The Danish Girl' and 'Ex Machina' than say a more well-endowed actress a la Angelina Jolie. With utmost respect to Jolie, Alicia Vikander proves herself to be a much more engaging Lara Croft than Jolie was in the earlier two 'Tomb Raider' feature films, even though the movie itself isn't quite as impressive as it needs to be to justify its existence.Like most such reboots are oft to do, this one takes the route of an origin story - here, the screenwriting duo of Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Alastair Siddons (working off a story credited to Evan Daugherty and Robertson-Dworet) reimagine Lara as a 21-year-old bike courier on the streets of East London who is struggling to make ends meet. When we first meet her, she's engaged in an intense boxing match that she eventually loses, but not without demonstrating her tenacity by refusing to tap out until she almost loses consciousness. That same fierce independence is the reason why she hasn't signed the papers to claim her father's inheritance since his disappearance seven years ago, although when her aunt Ana (Kristin Scott Thomas) tells her the estate would be sold if she doesn't, Lara acquiesces by turning up at the offices of her father's company Croft Holdings.Besides the papers, the lawyer hands her a wooden puzzle that opens up to reveal a key and a message which points her to her late mother's niche within the family memorial. There, she finds her father's secret office, learns of the legend of Himiko which he was pursuing, and follows a string of clues to try to track down his whereabouts. That journey will lead her first to Hong Kong's iconic floating village Aberdeen, where she meets the boatman Lu Ren (a criminally underused Daniel Wu) who leads her to the Japanese island of Yamatai where her father had vanished. You can pretty much guess how it unfolds from that point - Lara will fall into bad company (led by Walton Goggins's stony-faced Mathias Vogel), find out just what happened to her father, and then race against time to stop Vogel from opening the tomb and unleashing an ancient curse that would doom humanity forever.To the film's credit, our scepticism at the existence of such a primordial power is reflected in Lara herself, who up until confronted with the truth, cannot quite decide whether to dismiss the legend as pure myth. To its credit too, the revelation remains rooted in reality, which is in line with the filmmakers' intention to create an authentic heroine not unlike what Christopher Nolan had done for Batman. In fact, we dare say this version of Lara Croft owes a fair amount of dues to Nolan's 'Batman Begins', particularly with its father-daughter arc that underlines Lara's anguish following the sudden disappearance of her father as well as her subsequent reconciliation. Truth be told, giving a touch of pathos to Lara isn't exactly a bad thing: after all, Vikander certainly has the acting chops to make it work, and she does make Lara a lot more relatable, empathetic and worth rooting for.In the same vein, Lara is a lot less superhuman than she used to be. Save for one at the end, you won't see her making her signature incredible leaps. Indeed, one of the very first sequences that we see her spring into action - which features the iconic escape from the plane hulk from the 2013 edition of the game - finds her wounded, bleeding and in pain by the end of it. That same sensibility runs throughout the action in the film, which insists on a level of realism that the 'Tomb Raider' franchise is hitherto not known for - and among the highlights are a thrilling foot chase around the Aberdeen harbour atop its fishing boats and floating establishments, another exhilarating one through the dense tropical jungle that culminates in a literal cliff-hanger involving the aforementioned aircraft, and last but not least the perilous trek into Himiko's tomb full of hidden traps and life-and-death puzzles.At the helm is Norwegian director Roar Uthaug, who's honed his craft in action thrillers on his home turf like 'The Wave' and 'Escape' and applies that sense of pace to sustain an energetic momentum from start to finish. Though the focus is no doubt on the Indiana Jones-style stunt pieces, one certainly hopes that Uthaug could have spent more time on developing its characters - not only are supporting ones like Lu Ren and Vogel hardly given much attention or thought, the fundamental turning point of Lara's transformation from plucky daughter to determined heroine comes off too abrupt - one moment she is pleading with her father to forget about his research, the next she is running through the forest back to Vogel's camp without breaking a sweat.As valiant as the attempt may be to give Lara Croft a new breath of life, we suspect that 'Tomb Raider' is simply not distinguishing enough in a time when popular culture is saturated with real-life heroes and comic book superheroes. This Lara is certainly a lot more grounded than Jolie's two earlier incarnations were, but besides taking a narrative leaf from Nolan's 'Batman Begins', this origin story should definitely have learnt the depth of character work required to establish a compelling lead character. If you're just here for the action, you probably won't be disappointed, but it'll take a lot more for you to be enthused for a sequel, which the epilogue of the shadowy organisation Trinity and a pair of HK USP Match handguns all but suggests.",Tomb Raider
82,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Tomb Raider"" (2018)- The best video-game-to-film adaptation since 1995's 'Mortal Kombat.' Generally well-acted and executed despite a handful of silly moments.",8,21 March 2018,"It seems so strange, but despite nearly 30 years of effort... Hollywood so far hasn't really gotten the grasp on adapting video-games to film. And this is despite the fact that many modern games are incredibly cinematic in scope and story, and could very easily be adapted to the big-screen. Yet, despite their efforts, studios just haven't quite gotten it down yet. Sure, there has been the occasion decent effort- Christophe Gans' ""Silent Hill"" and Paul W.S. Anderson's ""Mortal Kombat"" definitely coming to mind- but for the most part... for every one decent video-game-movie that's released, there's about a dozen or so duds that get dumped into theaters and forgotten quickly after.And while 2018's ""Tomb Raider"" movie reboot might not quite be the definitive adaptation to finally break that curse and show the world that games can be turned into quality films... it's definitely one of the best attempts thus far. Heck, I'd say it's easily the single best attempt since the aforementioned 1995 release ""Mortal Kombat."" Despite some needless liberties taken with the narrative and a handful of shaky moments that don't add up, it largely succeeds thanks to sharp direction, a good sense of pacing and some excellent performances by all involved- especially Alicia Vikander, who lights up the screen as our new Lara Croft.Lara Croft (Vikander) is a woman lost- haunted by the disappearance of her millionaire-father Richard (Dominic West) seven years ago, and unsure of where to go in life as she enters adulthood, she wastes away her hours doing odd jobs and taking part in illegal street races. However, upon discovering a series of clues that hint to her father's potential whereabouts, she sets off on a personal journey to try and solve the mystery behind his vanishing... which brings her to a supposedly cursed island where her father's vile former associate Mathias Vogel (Walton Goggins) has set up camp. Soon enough, Lara realizes she must stop Vogel, whom is seeking out an ancient tomb whose contents could spell doom for all humanity!Director Roar Uthaug (which is a fantastic name, by the way) executes the film quite well, from a script by Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Alastair Siddons. (Seriously, the credits have some awesome sounding names...) His camerawork and sense of composition is slick and stylish, and he very-much takes many visual cues from the 2013 video-game reboot from which this film takes the majority of its inspiration. A stand-out scene featuring a collapsing plane perched atop a waterfall being particularly breathtaking, and amongst the finest uses of both practical and digital effects so far this year. The storyline and pacing is fast and breezy, and there's never a dull moment, which is quite the feat in a film juggling as many characters and plot-threads as this film does. On the whole- the production is solid all around.And the cast is just electric. Goggins is a delight as our villainous presence. While he might not be a household name, he's definitely a well-known and much-beloved character actor, and he does a great job with the material he's given. West is likable and charming as Lara's long-lost father, and the flashbacks featuring him definitely give the film a slight emotional core that comes much appreciated. And Daniel Wu is a ton of fun as one of Lara's collegues- a drunken ship-captain who she ropes into her journey. There's also some really nice supporting roles, including an extended cameo by Nick Frost as a pawn-store owner that add a lot of flair to the film. Great performances all around!But the standout here is definitely Vikander as our titular 'Tomb Raider.' She's just a blast and a half. The film is very much an origin story, and Vikander is clearly having the time of her life showing Lara's evolution from damaged young girl to no-nonsense woman. She's charming. She's likable. She's spunky and endearing. And she owns the screen, giving a perfect balance of vulnerability and determination that helps her define the role of Lara Croft. Plus... she's totally believable in the wild action set-pieces. Story goes she spent months preparing for the role and put on a ton of lean muscle, and it pays off. She's one kick-butt chick! Bravo, Ms. Vikander! Bravo!Unfortunately, these perks do come with a bit of a trade-off, which is where the film loses some points for me. To start, the film is clearly taking the bulk of its inspiration from the 2013 video-game reboot, which eschewed the prior games in order to tell a new story with a new take on the characters. And it was perfectly fine as it was. Yet, this film unfortunately takes many liberties with the story, and thus it can feel contrived from time to time. Seriously, producers... why not just adapt the game's story beat-for-beat? Why add so much new stuff that doesn't need to be there? Additionally, I felt the film's handling of some of its subplots was a bit suspect. The most blaring example being the father-daughter relationship between Lara and Richard. It's just too simplistic, being reduced down to basic clichés we've seen a million times before. And finally... and without spoiling anything... the movie has a number of twists and turns that just didn't add up for me, and felt somewhat shoehorned. It cheapens the pay-off.But on the whole, I can't help but say I had an absolute blast with ""Tomb Raider."" It's a ton of fun despite its faults, and is elevated by top-notch direction and a remarkable cast that are clearly giving their all. We may still be waiting for the definitive video-game movie (I know I'd love to see a good ""Legend of Zelda"" trilogy myself)... but in the meantime, this movie is definitely a valiant and very enjoyable effort! I give it a good 7.5 out of 10.",Tomb Raider

I was so hoping for a new twist after I saw the waterfall / plane sequence but it was dire, cliched retread of many poor adventure films that have gone before.I am lost for words after sitting through this utter tosh - They are so lost for ideas in Hollywood they are remaking movies less than a decade old now and the score for the movie John KXL was utterly uninspiring.The rating for this movie is really skewed it doesn't deserve more than a lacklustre 4/10.",Tomb Raider
86,Troy_Campbell,Yawn-inducing garbage.,3,19 March 2018,"With brand recognition of the utmost importance in today's blockbuster landscape, it is no surprise that we're being served up a reboot to a franchise based on a video game. Or maybe it's a prequel? Or a direct adaptation of the game series? It doesn't really matter, because this movie is completely disposable. Serving as an origin story to some degree, this Lara Croft (Alicia Vikander) is a brash adrenaline junkie ready to self-destruct at any moment. She's not yet the gun-toting badass we know she will become, but Vikander has a raw physicality that suits the role. It's a shame then, that she's hamstrung by an astonishingly bad script. Clichés abound in a plot that relies on clunky exposition, signposted twists and flimsy character motivation, and that's even before the laughably woeful final act. The action doesn't fare much better either, with the uninspired choreography, choppy editing and undercooked CGI resulting in a complete lack of thrills. This is the sort of lazy action flick where mercenary henchmen wielding semi-automatic weapons miss targets from only a few metres away, and a ridiculous abundance of chokeholds are used to ""raise"" the stakes. But perhaps the biggest atrocity is Walton Goggins' antagonist Mathias Vogel, a villain so disinterested he's practically comatose. At times I thought Goggins was about to break the fourth wall and apologetically explain to the audience that he needed the paycheque to cover some debts. Vikander is clearly trying her hardest but it's ultimately to no avail, Tomb Raider is a yawn-inducing adventure that'll quickly be forgotten.",Tomb Raider
87,NijazBaBs,"original, but too late",7,23 January 2021,"I am amazed, better than expected. Although I watched this before, it is easy to forget how great this is, and according to my rating, even better than original (first two sequels). Although the vice versa is what I keep thinking still, my rating proves the truth. Maybe this sequel looks worse than previous two because we all got used to main and first actor and older times and did not watch movie for so long. But as soon as I see it, I see it for what it is. Why is it better than original? Probably because it is more natural, simple, and adjusted to our current decade. The original one or two, is more complicated, and makes us easily tired. This one gets us ready because up to this one's release date, we get time to understand and prepare ourselves for watching and understanding. Realistic intro, which is comparable to real life. The transition to unreal stuff is slow, natural, normal. Bit negative like original where one hot girl gets all the attention and brakes guys' hearts, like this is movie about hot girl and not about tombs. But that beauty and makeup fall as movie progresses. As her beauty falls towards end, her character builds up, especially in form of courage, faith, and being different or unusual. Emotional, magic, game analogue. Best for game and courage lovers. Also enough presence of people and environment and various props, of which is to me the most amazing the wreck of airplane, which pops up questions in my mind. Historic, scientific, adventurous. Still this is not the best movie, there are far more deep, emotional, and interesting ones.",Tomb Raider
88,thekarmicnomad,Needs a crash diet,6,5 June 2018,"This is loosley based on the game (that I greatly enjoyed)
The main character needs to jump and climb and shoot things with a bow and arrow. 
Why? No one cares.There is quite a lot of good action in this film and people who played the game will be impressed how much of the scenic shots mirror the game in look and feel.The acting, camera work and stunts are all of a high quality.
On the surface this should be pretty great.This film yearns to be more than it is.
The first half an hour builds a tedious back story for Lara which is not only inconsistent with the game lore but pretty dull and pointless.Once Lara starts on her travel she wanders from action scene to action scene that never really feel linked together.The reboot version of the game is much grittier and realistic than the first but did suffer from jump fatigue. You could only play it for an hour at a time before you got bored of leaping off a cliff just to get your fingertips on the next ledge - again.
The old version has more puzzle solving, is more kitsch and much less real.These differences translate to big screen quite accurately.
Although this film is more realistic and grittier I found it much less fun.
Lara Croft was never meant to represent a real person any more than any of Arnold Schwarzenegger's characters were - this feels like it is trying to be more serious than it needs to be.

91,phubbs,Tomb Raider,4,9 June 2018,"So 'Tomb Raider' was a game from Core Design that was released back in 1996 primarily for the Sony Playstation. Many sequels followed over the years taking us up to the 2013 release which was a reboot of the games series. This 2013 version gave us a new in depth look into the origins of the games protagonist, Lara Croft. This 2018 movie is an adaptation of the 2013 game reboot whilst also being a reboot of the first two Tomb Raider movies from 2001 and 2003.A Tsunami of Cliches (the plot): The most generic plot they have come up with? Yep. Lara (Alicia Vikander) is essentially a mega rich British woman thanks to her fathers business of whatever. But for some reason Lara is not interested in accepting her fathers inheritance because reasons. Her father Richard (Dominic West) disappeared whilst searching for Himiko, a mythical Queen who was said to have power over life and death. Richard is presumed dead (of course). So after much personal angst and discovering the stereotypical hidden chamber stocked with clues, Lara goes off on an intrepid adventure in search of her dad. Briefly, she meets up with a good looking toned Chinese bloke. She convinces him to help her. They both sail off to find this mysterious island set right in the middle of a treacherous section of the Pacific (where no on ever survives type scenario). They get shipwrecked on the island. Lara gets 'rescued' by what turns out to be the bad guys. The bad guys work for a dodgy company who are also after this mystical supernatural power. The bad guys are all big muscular blokes carrying large automatic weapons. They find the location of the mystical Queens tomb. Its chock full of booby traps. They get past all the booby traps. All the bad guys get killed. Lara makes it out alive as the whole place comes tumbling down. Generic enough for you?The start of this movie doesn't really help. Lara is in London working for as a bike courier and decides to enter into this rather childish game of chase for money. Basically loads of blokes try to catch her and grab this fox tail off her bike (essentially a flag) before she can reach a certain destination, I think? The entire sequence looks lame and stupid. Its cringeworthy because the whole time there is this rock soundtrack playing in the background as if the entire sequence is supposed to be 'kewl'; like its some kind of extreme sports around west London, pfft! All the guys chasing her have these extreme haircuts, shades, clearly expensive bike gear, inked and pierced up etc...Its so flippin' pathetic.But at least that sequence was real in real locations. Unfortunately so much of this movie looks fake because its bolstered with tonnes of CGI. The now infamous waterfall sequence which we all saw in the trailers, yeah it looks terrible. The bomber looks terrible, the rapids look terrible, and Vikander copy and pasted against it all looks terrible. Speaking of that bomber, kinda looked like a WWII plane. That in itself would be a huge discovery...but who cares! No time for that. Literally everything Lara does in this movie is against bloody obvious CGI. All the set piece backdrops, every time she leaps across something (in cliched slow motion), hangs from something, stands in front of something. Not only that but Lara is bloody useless in this movie too. She literally spends the whole time getting beaten to a pulp by various blokes, only occasionally does she manage to actually win...kinda. I mean on one hand that's more realistic for sure but blimey does she take a beating in this. Lara also takes a huge amount of damage ranging from really nasty landings from heights, getting struck by objects, and even getting a puncture wound in the belly! Its like they went for realism in terms of fighting blokes, but went down the videogame invincibility route for surviving really nasty incidents.The whole bit with Lara finding her dad was incredibly incredibly predictable and cliched. I mean it was so fudging obvious right from the start. The fact it actually happened and director Roar Uthaug tried to make it surprising just made me facepalm. Not only that but naturally her dad just happens to have a bow and arrow with him, something that Lara just happens to be a dab hand at (ugh!! please!). So now Lara's running around with an apparent unlimited supply of arrows. Oh and all the bad guys drop dead straight away after being shot by an arrow, stone dead instantly.Lets take a quick look at the bad guys who are led by Mathias Vogel (Walton Goggins) and who all work for the shadowy Hyd...I mean Trinity organisation. Well as I said before they're pretty much you're bog standard merc type in movies these days. All roided up with hipster beards and tattoos. There only appears to be about six of them at first but their numbers become inexplicably bigger during an action sequence. Suddenly there are loads of guys just waiting to get shot with guns or arrows. The only bad guy of any worth is of course Vogel. A solid slimy villain who is quite happy to kill people. The rest are just background fodder for weapons and booby traps.I find it amusing in movies like this how both the protagonist and antagonist are looking for one specific item and often ignore everything else. Like in this movie they discover this ancient tomb with wall to wall treasures such as ancient text on walls, markings, various artifacts, what looked like precious gems or stones to stop a booby trap etc...Heck even the various skeletons lying around the place could be historically important. But they always totally ignore all that, often allowing the stuff to get destroyed in the process.Frankly the entire movie is a snooze fest until Lara and co reach the subterranean tomb of Himiko. There we get some nice thrills with the booby traps but even that can't detract from the fact its retreading very familiar ground from a certain Spielberg/Lucas franchise. I mean they virtually copy some aspects beat for beat to a degree. I quite liked the notion that this ancient mystical power turns out to be a deadly potent disease. But then they absolutely ruined it by going down this zombie-esque state route. I mean honesty, hasn't that whole angle been totally milked dry already, come on guys. I quite liked how they made the movie a bit more adult orientated, a bit dark. Its was also acceptable that Lara wasn't a superhero type character all the time, although I felt she did need to be a bit tougher at times. Its a fine balance I know but Lara did seem a bit sidelined in her own movie at times (maybe that's just me). But overall I'm pretty shocked at how generic this was and the fact they copied other movies.4.5/10",Tomb Raider

As soon as I heard that Tomb Raider was getting rebooted with her as Lara Croft, I was so game. I played one of the PS one Tomb Raider's way back when (didn't get very far in it though). Didn't care much for the Tomb Raider series with Angelina Jolie and was hoping this film could head in a better direction and be of better quality than that. I wasn't disappointed with this. Its flawed and could have been better for sure, but its fun for what it was.Lara Croft's life is changed when her aunt says she will inherit her fathers rich inheritance, since he had disappeared years ago and was now assumed to be dead. Her father leaves her a puzzle and so she finds out about her fathers research chasing the myth of Himiko, who had the power of life over death. Basically, Croft goes on an adventure to find out more about this mystery and what had happened to her father. The film also enlists the talents of Walton Goggins who is always good.I love Vikander as Croft. Her dedication to the role and all around performance is the best. Unlike the Lara Croft we see in the Jolie films, we are seeing Croft on her first real adventure. She gets beat up, thrown around, and is running around from consistent danger. She has no stopping, its pure adrenaline action when she's on screen. The origin story itself isn't the best, especially when you get deeper into the tomb and find out about the myth. It requires a suspension of believe, as you have to do with a lot of the action scenes in the film. Its still a fine decent little action film. The scenery looks good and Vikander finally gets to shine as an action star. While she is great, some of the characters are very cliched and uni dimensional.The film has storytelling flaws, is slightly long, and may show signs of wear as the film moves along. Its still a step in thee right direction for a franchise that wasn't very good. I see it as a film that's meant to be non serious and a vehicle to create another strong athletic female heroine.

It's pretty good.Starring Alicia Vikander, TOMB RAIDER is the origin story of how Lara Croft becomes a...ahem...Tomb Raider. This is the first starring role in a big ""tent pole"" film for her and she holds the center of the story quite well. Best known as the Oscar winner for Best Supporting Actress in THE DANISH GIRL (which I feel was a consolation prize for her from the Academy as a way of apologizing for not even nominating her for her Oscar-worthy performance in EX MACHINA), TOMB RAIDER transforms Ms. Vikander into a viable action star. Her Lara Croft is not a ""super-hero"" who is impervious to pain, rather, she is a real person (a tough one, I'll admit) but when she gets hurt, she feels it.Doing everything but twirling his mustache is Walton Goggins as Mathias Vogel a rival Tomb Raider looking to raid the same tomb. Why are they looking for this tomb? Does it matter? Nope. The fun is in the journey - and what fun there is. Norwegian Director Roar Uthaug (THE WAVE) keeps the action moving swiftly, jumping from one clue to another and one stunt to another, rarely slowing down for the audience to think - and that's a good thing, because as I'm thinking about this film a day later, I'm beginning to punch some pretty big holes in the plot. But...that doesn't matter because watching Croft/Vikander get herself out of trouble is entertaining.Also shining in this film is Daniel Wu as Lu Ren, who's father, Lu Ren, disappeared chasing the same tomb as Croft's father (Dominic West). Ren and Crofft team up to race Vogel to the tomb.Along for the ride in smaller-ish roles - in what appears to be the first film of a series - are such stalwarts as Nick Frost (uncredited), Jaime Winstone, Derek Jacobi and Kristen ScottThomas. All of whom must have been promised larger roles in later films in this series.A solid start to the series.

98,fernandoschiavi,"""Tomb Raider"" is a fun adventure, with some exciting scenes that can please those who know the games of the franchise or not",7,24 October 2020,"15 years after the second film in the franchise, GK Films acquired the franchise rights, planning to launch a reboot of the story. Filming for this new adventure began in January 2017 in Cape Town, South Africa and was completed in June 2017 at Warner Brothers Studios in Leavesden. Produced by MGM, Warner Bros. Pictures, GK Films and Square Enix and distributed by Warner Bros., stars Alicia Vikander - replacing Angelina Jolie as Lara Croft -, Walter Goggins, Daniel Wu and Dominic West.Written by Geneva Robertson-Dworet and Alastair Siddons, from a story by Evan Daugherty and Robertson-Dworet, based on the eponymous game from Crystal Dynamics 2013, including elements from its sequel, being a reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise. This new adaptation is yet another attempt by Hollywood to understand the gaming industry. While other adaptations have changed much of the plot and swapped characters to make them more plausible for the audience, the film makes almost no concessions. It is the most faithful adaptation that a video game can have, visually and mainly in action.The feature film presents the story of Lara Croft (Alicia Vikander), a young woman who leads a simple life as a delivery girl in London while disowning the inheritance left by her father (Dominic West), left for dead after a trip across the Pacific Ocean. After receiving a clue as to what her father was investigating at the time, she sets out on an adventure to discover the secret behind the island of Yamatai and the mysterious legend of Himiko - a plot that was part of the Tomb Raider game released in 2013. Since the the first sequence, when we are introduced to the main conflict, the feature makes it clear that it is necessary to deal with the suspension of disbelief in order to be able to get involved with what is happening on the screen. Likewise, there is a simple but functional preparation for the adventure that will be the focus of this film. Lara is not afraid to face challenges, regardless of the consequences - right in the first scene in which she appears, she is punched during a boxing match - and her development will be completed with flashbacks, in a simple and sometimes lazy narrative structure, but that justifies some of the protagonist's decision-making (like her ability with the bow, for example).This relationship with disbelief is important so that the film can take advantage of elements common in games, but which may seem forced into a film narrative. So, when Lara, even injured and tired, manages to climb a cliff during a night storm, this should not sound strange, after all, it is an expected skill for the character in the context already established. The film handles these details well, precisely because it knows how to treat them naturally. Lara doesn't seem to have superpowers; she just uses skills developed along her trajectory. These details also allow scenes that bring the film even closer to the games. They are visually interesting for those who have never had contact with the franchise in video games and longtime fans should sound more intimate. And even in exaggerations, as in the attempt to reach a final climax, when Lara needs to escape the tomb, the protagonist has actions inspired directly from videogames.
Alicia Vikander is doing very well in the role of Lara Croft. Even though she is a woman with a fragile appearance (small and thin), the actress manages to convey a strength, vigor and bravery that are intrinsic to the character, in an impressive way. It is clear that Vikander dedicated himself body and soul in physical preparation, training a lot for the action scenes. However, more than the mere exchange of names, it is important to notice the relevant process of reframing that the character spent in this decade and a half hiatus on the big screen. Such transformation is explicit in the first scene presented, after the explanatory opening around the sorceress Himiko: the punch in the face received by Lara, associated with a defeat in the fight practiced in the middle of the academy, immediately eliminates the aura of unbeatability around the character. ""She's no superhero,"" the script quickly warns. The search for a more ""normal"" Lara Croft is ubiquitous, either by highlighting its weaknesses or even by removing it from the luxurious environment around its origin - which is there, as a background, but only to contextualize it. The new Lara despises the fortune she has, preferring to assume her destiny by working as a delivery girl and paying her own bills, a path quite different from that shown in previous films that is also a reflection of the empowerment of women in general in recent years. Far from any kind of sexualization, Vikander's Lara Croft is an interesting adaptation as it is not portrayed with forced stereotypes, nor does it need to prove itself all the time. Your goal is just to find out what happened to your father. Even with a weak evolution at the end of the film, its presentation and the way it was used are convincing. Something that doesn't happen with the villain, Mathias Vogel (Walton Goggins from ""Maze Runner: The Mortal Healing""). The attempt to humanize it weakens its development in the narrative and the ambiguity suggested is hardly credible.There is also a change in attitude towards the character. If before we invested more in the sex symbol side of Lara Croft, exploring the sensuality typical of silicone heroines created for digital, here this aspect is also left out. There are the posed scenes that explored the beauty of Angelina Jolie in the name of a character more people like us, something greatly aided by the work of Alicia Vikander. If this is clearly the character that demanded the most from her on the physical side, she still manages to convey a humanity in the look that, at various times, helps to situate her dramatically within the narrative. Not that this is the central focus of the film, of course, but it assists the new Lara Croft in this quest to be a more contemporary character. Still, even if there is no free exploration of Vikander's body, the Swede is a beautiful and sensual woman with extreme naturalness.The script is weak in the construction of the narrative, using the most basic clichés to present the character. Tom Raider can be divided into two very distinct films. If in the first half there is all this work in restoring the central character, betting on a fun urban rally that plays with the idea of the British custom of fox hunting, the final stretch takes on the typical dynamic of a video game, with challenges followed - and sometimes absurd - that need to be overcome by heroin. Norwegian director Roar Uthaug films sequences that are clearly inspired by game challenges and missions; for example, when Lara needs to figure out how to open a portal or jump off a platform. Despite paying homage to the franchise's original media, these scenes do not work cinematically, perhaps because the film forgets that the media have different logics. Roar Uthaug's confused direction ends up damaging the fight scenes, with an excessively shaky camera (either to create a notion of disorder or due to poorly executed choreography) that harms too much at certain times. His way of telling the story is also predictable, something that becomes uncomfortable in the third act, when it is possible to guess what will happen in the next scene from the way the character's act (and here it is also possible to notice a certain laziness in the script working on events better).
Another problem with the script is that it takes itself too seriously. There are exchanges of dialogues that are almost embarrassing, with some catchphrases that should make us laugh - but they don't reach the goal. The new Tomb Raider abandons any attempt at (re) creation to invest in more of the same, mind-boggling tricks that bring neither emotion nor the slightest doubt of what will happen next. Mythology has been reduced to legends, the madness of certain characters is shown only when it matters and the climax is irrelevant. In addition, the film is too concerned with making viewers understand exactly what brings Lara to the island where she believes her father is lost and explains the legend of the cursed Japanese queen several times, repeating explanatory dialogues to exhaustion. By the way, the lines are weird and cannot convey realism. Discussions about the fate of humanity seem to be played every two or three scenes to try to give some relevance to everything we see on the scene.With an invigorating beginning and a dragging end, clearly inspired by The Raiders of the Lost Ark, Tomb Raider yields to a handful of displaced dialogues, machine guns that conveniently fail and villains who magically recover in order to create successive sequences of action that, almost always, add nothing. The exception is due to the good scene of the plane at the edge of a waterfall, well executed both in the dynamics of Lara Croft and in the special effects used. In addition, attention is drawn to the care of the production in recreating classic poses of the character in videogames, such as his swinging on the rope and his slightly biased gait, always wearing the indefectible dark green T-shirt. After all, as much as this is a Lara Croft more focused on today, certain characteristics never change. Among fickle adaptations, which do little to honor the original media, ""Tomb Raider"" is a fun adventure, with some exciting scenes that can be more pleasing to those who know the games of the franchise, but that can also work with the public not started, who just waits for a movie without great pretensions. It is certainly not the definitive adaptation of a video game, while it is not (yet another) frustrated attempt.",Tomb Raider

100,dave-mcclain,a joyless slog,3,16 March 2018,"""Tomb Raider"" (PG-13, 1:58) is a reboot of the erstwhile Angelina Jolie franchise (with 2001 and 2003 ""Lara Croft Tomb Raider"" films). All the movies are based on the British ""Tomb Raider"" action-adventure video game series, which came on the scene in 1996. Like the games, the movies have used various combinations of ""Tomb Raider"" and ""Lara Croft"" (the franchises' central character) in their titles. Naming tweaks aside, the question is if the 2018 changes in casting & approach pay off for Movie Fans. While Jolie's casting and portrayal matched the look and attitude of the video game heroine, Oscar winner Alicia Vikander brings a leaner and less mean Lara Croft to the big screen. Jolie brought the bad-ass female archaeologist/adventurer to life with a lot of swagger, but Vikander's Croft is more physically and emotionally vulnerable, full of fight, but yet to realize her potential, intellectually or in practice. The quality both characterizations share is intelligence and guts, but 2018's ""Tomb Raider"" is an origin story.Seven years after the disappearance of her father, wealthy businessman and adventurer Lord Richard Croft (Dominic West), Lara is a woman with no plan. Obviously intelligent, she's content trying to be a mixed martial artist and working as a bicycle messenger. She wouldn't have to work at all, if she would just sign the documents declaring her father legally dead so she can inherit his company and his fortune, but she's having a very hard time letting go of the hope that her father, whom she idolizes, is still alive.When company officer (and Lara's former legal guardian), Ana Miller (Oscar nominee Kristin Scott Thomas), finally convinces Lara to swing by the office and sign those papers, Lara receives a Japanese puzzle box that her father left her. Solving the puzzle leads Lara to the discovery of what her father was really working on when he disappeared - trying to find the tomb of a legendary Japanese queen who supposedly possessed the power of life and death. Still hoping to find her father alive (or at least learn what happened to him), the clues lead Lara to Japan where she hires a reluctant but down-on-his-luck boat captain (Daniel Wu) to take her into the Devil's Sea to a remote island which is notoriously difficult to reach. Upon reaching the island, Lara discovers the ruthless Mathias Vogel (Emmy nominee Walter Goggins) leading an expedition to find the tomb for a mysterious international organization.Vikander's ""Tomb Raider"" (directed by Roar Uthaug) is a joyless, by-the-numbers actioner. In spite of Vikander's considerable talent and gravitas, she feels miscast as the tough and determined young adventurer. With the understanding that this is a Lara Croft origin story, it just becomes mind-numbing to see her beaten up throughout the movie, while none of the actors' performances rise about the level of serviceable. The script (by Evan Daugherty and Geneva Robertson-Dworet) features unnecessary dialog, characters whose motivations make little sense and a story which is mostly very predictable. Disappointing.

101,jrarichards,"Entertaining enough, but more so in the first half!!!",7,11 July 2021,"Director Roar Uthaug has some fun and joy to offer here that looks all the more attractive when seen from the perspective of pandemic world. But paradoxically (and sadly for him), there is less and less of that as we move from one segment of the film to the next.Lara as delivered sassily enough by the delightful Alicia Vikander is intriguing at the film's outset, given the tension between her current, rather stagnating self and the heiress with country estate plus City of London tycoon she could and would be were she only to accept that the 7-year absence of her father, Lord Richard Croft (here Dominic West) is tantamount to his being dead.That tension is a creative one, which by the way gels with much of the gentrified and less-gentrified reality of London - and indeed the film dotes on the great, diverse, wonderful British metropolis, as Lara sees both the slick and super-rich world personified by the offices of the family company somewhere near ""The Gerkhin""; and a more rough-and-ready, wise-cracking (and distinctly happy-looking) East End. Lara resides, (occasionally sort of) works and has friends and acquaintances in that latter world, in which many around her put up with her quirks and foibles as they find her irresistible (a fate many in the audience may tend to share).We in audience land of course know that this Lara is only sustainably interesting because of that other, more-sophisticated side (which we know will soon morph into adventure and danger), but that's a tricky paradox for the makers to deal with, given that many a filmgoer (in 2021 all the more so) will feel a tangible sense of loss and regret when the film leaves its (lovingly observed and actually quite lengthy presentation of) ""London Lara"" behind, for Hong Kong (as here substituted by South Africa). It's as if the makers knew instinctively that this first part of the movie is actually their best work - which it is!However, the Hong Kong segment as Lara begins to find her feet as a feisty adventurer morphs nicely into a sea-journey to Japan, with all the delights and dangers that always entails; and truly we can argue that there are few things to complain about up that point in the fast-paced and fun movie.But then we reach the real ""Tomb Raider"" element (of course half of the film and more), and it's NOT Indiana Jones and - though the key element of the story as revealed is reasonable and realistic enough (the film does not allow itself any supernatural moments of the kind Jones sometimes encounters) - it's NOT really as exciting as it might be; or worse - we are still probably in fact wondering if the Indian Restaurant owners' son back in London will ever pluck up the courage to ask out the lovely Lara!Such is the delight and the dilemma-cum-tragedy of the 2018 ""Tomb Raider"". From the perspective of pandemic world at least, ordinary life for a pretty and bright young woman in a bustling and beautiful London seems more interesting to the film buff than does a lost cave on a remote Japanese island (notwithstanding the hard-to-credit coincidence of a pandemic-related truth regarding what that island actually conceals!!!)Alicia Vikander offers a screen presence and is nice to watch. The three elements to her character's life have something going for them, but do we really want to see some of that personality and screen-time ""wasted"" on adventures of an archaelogical profile? That's a tough question ... and a tough break for the makers of the movie.",Tomb Raider

104,bob-the-movie-man,A tremendously energetic and fun video game spin-off.,8,15 March 2018,"This film is good... very good. ""I'M SORRY....? WHAT DID YOU SAY DR BOB??"" ""But this is a film about a VIDEO GAME! ... They are all uniformly dreadful!""I know - I can barely bring myself to admit it. But this one really is good. Most of this is down to the reason I was looking forward so much to this one. Alicia Vikander (""Ex Machina""; ""The Danish Girl""; ""The Light Between Oceans"") is such a class act, and here she is so much more than just a one-dimensional action hero. She hurts, she mourns, she feels guilt, she's vulnerable. And it's all there on her face. Great acting skill. She also kicks ass like no woman on film since Emily Blunt in ""Edge of Tomorrow""! The story by Evan Daugherty and Geneva Robertson-Dworet (with Alastair Siddons adding to the screenplay) rockets off in great style with a ""fox and hounds"" bike chase around the City of London which is brilliantly done and sets up Croft's character up with the minimum of tedious back story. Switch to the main story and Lara is struggling to face the fact that her father (Dominic West, ""Money Monster""), seen in flashback, is finally dead after going off to Japan seven years previously in search of the legendary tomb of ancient sorceress Queen Himiko. The Croft corp. COO (Kristin Scott Thomas, ""Darkest Hour"") persuades Lara its time to sign the necessary papers, but on the verge of this act the lawyer Mr Yaffe (Derek Jacobi, ""Murder on the Orient Express"") lets a significant cat out of the bag and sets Lara off on the trail of her long-dead father's original mission.It's a rollercoaster ride that's really well done. But I reckon the writers should have named Jeffrey Boam, George Lucas and Menno Meyjes as co-collaborators, for the film plagerises terribly from ""Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade"". In two or three places, the similarities are shocking! As in the best of Lucas traditions though there are some breathtaking set-pieces, with the best of them staged at the top of a raging waterfall that's just plane ridiculous! (Even if it plagerises blatantly from ""The Lost World""!). The movie's tremendous to look at too, with cinematography by George Richmond (""Kingsman""; ""Eddie the Eagle"") and (aside from a dodgy helicopter effect) good special effect by Max Poolman (""District 9"") and his team.My one criticism would be that Vogel - the chief villain, played by Walton Goggins (""The Hateful Eight"") - is rather too unremittingly evil to have two sweetly smiling young children in his desk photo. One can only hope he faces a nasty demise! The film is directed by Norwegian director Roar Uthaug, in what looks to be his first ""non-Norwegian"" film. Roar by name; roar by nature! He does a great job. An early ""summer blockbuster"" actioner that gets two thumbs up from me.

But it's still working. The one thing I don't like is that the character needs to be British but Alicia couldn't fake British accent enough. So, the casting director should have considered that before filming. I can feel that she's faking it as soon as I've heard. Except that fact, the rest is enjoyable.",Tomb Raider

Which is fine. It is after all, Tomb Raider. Expecting anything else would be unrealistic. Split feelings about the character. First, good actor. She did a fine job. On the one hand I have to give them creds for not choosing someone excessively top-heavy. Two thumbs up on that. But on the other hand, the actor did not have the physical build that would be required to pull off the stunts we saw repeatedly happen in this movie. The story wasn't bad. Decent plot. The ending was acceptable. But the entire movie felt like one video game scene after another. ""Okay, you have to survive the rapids. Now escape the crumbling airplane. Now overcome the puzzle to keep from..."" well, you get the idea. It is obvious this is a prelude to what they hope will be a huge new video game.Not that I'm complaining. It was a wild romp.

The sets are lavish and the plot somewhat reasonably revealed. Yet there's something missing from the plot: believability. The ultimate narrative appears silly to the core, and with several deaths resulting from the chasing after the unknowing secret, the final result is a mere shrug of the shoulders.

108,kjproulx,One of the Best Video Game Adaptations,6,16 March 2018,"Over the years, many writers and directors have attempted to make solid films based on beloved video game franchises, but they've almost always failed. For that reason alone, the bar was already very low, so this review may need to be taken with a grain of salt. For what it's worth, Tomb Raider is easily one of the best adaptations ever made. It's riddled with many of the same issues that previous attempts have, but these movies need to have a sense of fun and adventure, which I believe this film provides. This movie isn't going to be remembered as great, but it will almost always be present when speaking about the best films to come from a video game. If you're a fan of the games or just want to have a fun (even if disposable) time at the movies, then here's why I will absolutely recommend Tomb Raider to you.It's many years after the disappearance of her father and Lara Croft sets out on a journey to find a tomb that has been a mystery for years. Being the island that her father reportedly died at, she's faced with the sadness of her past. Filled with energy and fun action set pieces, this film clicks along at a fairly brisk pace, even though it does drag in some areas. It tries very hard to accomplish an emotional core in order to win over its audience in the third act, and for the most part, it works. The emotional core is one of the more enjoyable aspects about Tomb Raider, due to the fact that the performances here are truly what elevates this film from mediocre to good.Alicia Vikander continuously reminds audiences around the world that she's an actress who will be around for a very long time and I have zero complaints about that. Her portrayal of Lara Croft is far better than what Angelina Jolie brought to the role many years ago and the sense of adventure and story itself is also on a much more mature level. From Walton Goggins as the core villain to the short amount of screen time that Dominic West has as Lara's father, I can't commend this film enough for trying very hard with its characters. That being said, the screenplay itself could've used a few tweaks.Yes, as you can see, I was pleasantly surprised during my experience of Tomb Raider, but it's not all sunshine and rainbows I'm afraid. The dialogue definitely feels streamlined at times, not leaving enough clues for the audience to figure out the puzzles. They choose to allow the characters on-screen to reveal the answers after they've figured them out in their heads. On top of that, the climax of this film places every character in an impossible situation and it felt like I was watching someone try to accomplish an impossible task in an adventure-based video game. If you can forgive that, then the climax can be quite entertaining, but it's also very ridiculous and out of place when comparing it to the rest of the movie.In the end, Tomb Raider definitely won't make any top ten lists for 2018, nor will it be remembered as a great movie, but it's without question one of the best adaptations from a video game that's ever been made. It's not without a few glaring issues and the dialogue can be slightly generic and cringe-worthy at times, but I'd be lying if I didn't call this a fun adventure flick with some terrific and devoted performances all around. For action junkies or fans dying to see a decent adaptation for once, I feel no shame in recommending this one. I'm happy to say that this isn't a bad film and I would actually love if they're able to make a sequel. That may not be saying much for some people, but that seems like a fairly strong statement to me.",Tomb Raider
109,kuarinofu,A mess of scenes crumpled together,5,14 July 2018,"I've seen the old TR movies, player old and new games from the franchise, and after seeing this, I can say that Angelina Jolie movies hold up much better than this one.
And the new main lead is not the problem here, Alicia Vikander looks similar to the new younger version of Lara Croft (from the new games). Her acting was passable most of the time, granted nobody really tried that hard to begin with. Also, there was no real character bonds except maybe for daughter-father bond that was somewhat ok. Lu Ren had absolutely nothing to do in this movie like most of the other characters. There wasn't much dialogue and for what it had it was pretty bad, mostly either exposition or attempts at humor.
The main reason I was unable to enjoy this movie was the script. As I've already mentioned - this was just a mess of random scenes sloppily crumpled together. Sometimes the way they tried to connect the scenes through writing just felt extremely lazy and forced. Characters motivations are unclear, the story seems to be moving itself most of the time, the mystery wasn't that good, there's not a lot of tomb raiding in this and it was very cliche.
What I think probably happened is they have approached this movie from the wrong side. This tries so hard to be a video game cutscene it almost mimics most of the gameplay scenes and even third person camera in the latest games. This is not how you make a movie. Even if it is a video game based movie. Don't make a game you can't play but watch. Take some existing characters or invent new ones, give them a mystery, motivation and some interaction between them and fill the rest with good action. Nobody is going to ask more from a video game based movie. Hell, old TR movies were pretty straightforward.
On the other hand, watching someone else playing a game for 2 hours in a movie theater is just boring..",Tomb Raider
110,AhmedSpielberg99,"Tomb Raider is the only movie that based on a video game that feels like a video game, for better or worse!",6,17 June 2018,"One of the things that I liked about this movie is that it didn't rely so much on fantasy, of course it has some supernatural elements, but it has some sense of reality either when it comes to the adventure of Lara Croft or the depiction of Lara Croft herself, or at least at the beginning. She seemed as she is just a well-trained girl who is fit and has some good fighting skills, but as the movie proceeds and Lara becomes at risk, we see that she is more like a superhero rather than a good fighter, and that didn't work for me at all. Also, she is implausibly smart and quick-witted, and that saves a lot of time that should have been spent on putting some puzzle pieces and discovering important things.Surprisingly, Lara Croft wasn't likable at the beginning, but as the movie goes forward she became more and more interesting, and that, in large part, due to Alicia Vikander appealing performance, she really nailed it! Alicia Vikander proved that was the right cast choice for Lara Croft, whether from her appearance, or her acting abilities in the dramatic moments. Speaking of drama, I am so happy that this movie didn't try to be a tearjerker movie, specially at displaying Lara's past and her father. But, that doesn't mean that we got a good origin story of Lara, actually everything else about Lara's past and her story with her father was terrible! The origin story here is not just uninspired, but it's a total mess.There are some plot holes in the movie. In addition, there are a lot of exposition, and a lot of explaining. And the dialogue in general isn't very good. The plot itself is somewhat muddled. Also, there is a stupid plot-twist. The action sequences are by no means special or inventive, but what makes up for it is the camera work in these action sequences that resembles the video games. All the camera movements and the camera angles are pretty much look like those of video games, and that was really cool! While I didn't the action isn't intense, I was very entertained by it. That being said, The movie still has a cinematic feel, and it looked very nice. Thankfully, this movie is not CGI-heavy, as I mentioned above that it didn't rely so much on fantasy, but when there are some scenes that require using special effects, the CGI looked a bit poor. The humor isn't so great, but Nick Frost has two cameos, and he was hilarious as usual.The villain is clichéd and very weak. Of course, there is a sequel bait ending Despite all its major flaws, I enjoyed Tomb Raider!(6/10)",Tomb Raider

There are thrilling action sequences, a twist on a car chase but on bikes at the beginning, a ship wreck, an escape down some rapids sequence, it's pretty tense in places. Unfortunately the plot is a little lame and the dialogue is pretty poor, although it's probably perfect for the intended 12 year old audience. Alicia Vikander was the best thing about the film, she carries it throughout, almost all my grade is for her contribution. I know the Lara Croft character normally carries 2 enormous guns and by golly we see them in the final sequence.I'm NOT a computer games geek, so I can't be sure if it's an accurate interpretation of the computer game it originates from.

113,msbreviews,Rating: B,7,21 March 2018,"If you enjoy my Spoiler-Free reviews, please follow my blog :)Alicia Vikander (Lara Croft) is the new face of the Tomb Raider's franchise reboot and it is going to be based on the critically acclaimed video-games.This first installment is an adaptation of the 2013 game and it tells the story of Lara Croft, a young woman who lost her father when she was a teen. Struggling to move past his mysterious disappearance, she leaves everything behind and goes looking for him in his last-known (dangerous) location: a famous tomb on a mythical island ...Roar Uthaug throws himself into the lion's den and brings us another movie adaptation of a video-game. As you probably know, there is a so-called ""curse"" which consists of the ""fact"" that every cinematic adaptation of a video-game is basically horrible. Honestly, I do agree that every adaptation failed to even reach the lowest expectations. However, I think critics do not know how to deal with their expectations when it comes to this kind of films.There is always a huge fanbase for every successful game. Far Cry, Mortal Kombat, Assassin's Creed, you name it. Obviously, if a movie based on one of these games comes out, every fan will lose their minds. Their expectations will be ridiculously high and that is the number one reason why every film has very low ratings. Critics also play these games and they are also fans. So, if a movie fails to reach the expectations, the reviews will be way more negative than what they are supposed to be because it is based on something that the person loves as much or more than films.For example, take Warcraft. This game has probably the biggest fanbase in the entire world. Gamers actually liked the movie but truthfully, it does have a lot of narrative and editing issues, which makes the story hard to follow and understand (the characters also needed more development). However, does it deserve such negative reviews like it received? No! I can understand if a critic writes a mixed review, sure. But I read negative reviews that completely trashed the film and the reasons why the movie failed were the exact same as mine.So, why did I rate it positively and others so negatively? Expectations. Dealing with them is key to achieve a fair review. I reject ""love or hate"" reviews. Why can't people just accept that a film is just ""fine""? Why do people have to trash a movie just because it isn't perfect like they dreamed of? It can still be good, it can still be ok. This leads me to Tomb Raider and to what I think is the best film adaptation of a video-game so far ... Even though this does not mean that much.Story-wise, the movie deviates from the game while the latter's standout action set pieces are remarkably performed in the film. Lara's backstory is compelling and it definitely makes you care for her. This is my main praise to this movie. Sequels can actually be produced since not only Tomb Raider is a good film, Lara Croft is a beautifully-developed character.Alicia Vikander was the big question before the movie. Is she going to top Angelina Jolie? Truthfully, Jolie had to deal with horrible scripts and she is the only reason why those films are watchable. However, Vikander proves that she deserved that Oscar she received. She is flawless! Every expression, every line of dialogue, every grunt, every scream ... She does everything with an unbelievable badassery and I believe she is one of the best female castings of the last years (same perfect level as Emma Watson as Belle and Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman).The rest of the cast serve their purpose well and nothing else. Vikander totally carries the entire movie but I wish the supporting characters were not just some video-game pawns that only serve to develop the main character or as a plot device. Uthaug does a great job as the director, shooting some suspenseful scenes extremely well-adapted from the game. However, there is a lot of shaky-cam and quick cuts that bring the action down, plus the CGI is not always great.Putting aside the action, the visuals are actually pretty neat with a surprising amount of practical settings as well. The editing is good but it could have been way better and the score works fine. Uthaug really nails the film's tone and pacing. I felt invested throughout the whole runtime without ever feeling bored. Vikander plays a big role in this but the control of both aspects is superb.While it does break the video-game curse, it still has some frustrating flaws. There is still a lot to be learned when adapting a game since the typical cliches keep emerging. Not every aspect of a game's story is believable and Tomb Raider has tons of scenes where it is impossible not to think ""yeah, this does not acknowledge any law of physics whatsoever"". The action set pieces are great but some of them feel too video-game-ish and I disconnect from the movie.Huge plot devices exist throughout every act. The characters make choices that are just silly and it seems that only Lara Croft is the rational one. This could have been a GREAT film and it stops at ""good"". It could have broken the curse in such a spectacular way and despite it being far better than any other adaptation, it stills falls in the genre's cliches and it contains some narrative issues.Nevertheless, I was deeply entertained. The first act is flawless. From character development to action, it has everything and everything is incredibly realized. As the movie progresses, the action starts taking over and the story begins lacking logic, even though Vikander always keeps us captivated. I feel a bit frustrated because I know that this film had everything to be amazing, but it is surely a step in the right direction. At least, Uthaug focused on making a good movie first, instead of trying to set up hundreds of sequels. This is how you start a franchise.All in all, Tomb Raider breaks the video-game curse and it is definitely the best film adaptation, so far. That said, it is not amazing nor ground-breaking. It has a lot of narrative issues, plot devices and supporting characters that only serve the plot. Gamers will love how the movie perfectly represents the game's standout action sequences, even though some look too video-game-ish. Excellent control of the tone and pacing, but the real win for the franchise is Alicia Vikander as an incredibly-developed Lara Croft. Vikander carries the entire thing, her character's backstory is beautifully written and Tomb Raider is a good first installment for what I expect to be a fantastic saga.",Tomb Raider

116,MrDHWong,"Does little to lift the video game film adaptation curse, but it is certainly one of the better ones, which unfortunately is not saying much",6,28 June 2018,"Tomb Raider is an action-adventure film based on the video game series of the same name. Starring Alicia Vikander in the lead role, it's a mostly enjoyable, albeit generic action film serving to reboot the franchise for modern audiences.In London, Lara Croft (Alicia Vikander), the independent and strong-willed daughter of a missing adventurous businessman, works as a bike courier to make ends meet. One day, Lara is set to inherit her father's mass fortune, and upon doing so, stumbles across a secret passage in his tomb with clues to his last known whereabouts on a mysterious island.While it does offer some fun action and clever puzzle-solving as seen in the games, Tomb Raider's plot feels highly pedestrian and generic. Each time Croft seems to be in danger, there is always something convenient right nearby that will help her out of it, which spoils any real surprise in the story. Most of the characters are forgettable and underdeveloped, with the exceptions being Lara Croft herself and the villain Mathias Vogel (Walton Goggins). Alicia Vikander is clearly giving it her all as Lara Croft and there was never a moment where I felt she was not right for the role. To compare her to Angelina Jolie's performance would be unfair, as they are two completely different takes on the character, with Jolie being the classic PlayStation One-era Croft and Vikander's being the modern rebooted games Croft. Overall, this film does little to lift the video game film adaptation curse, but it is certainly one of the better ones, which unfortunately is not saying much.I rate it 6/10",Tomb Raider
117,Alexander_Blanchett,This was not necessary,6,11 August 2018,"It was a fine reboot that offered a good first third and a decent last third, the problem of the film was the scene in between that felt dried out and had extreme lengths. It was also not really anything new or anything that we had seen before. It did not have enough drama and (unpredictable ) twists.
Alicia Vikander held herself very well as a young version of the famous computer game character. She was a good choice for the more innocent and unexperienced Lara Croft. She had the right tenderness for the role. Dominic West was good enough but nothing really special. Walter Goggins made a good villain, he is born to play roles like that.... they just need to be more edgier so he can put out all his acting weapons, not one dimensional characters like that. But that is a common problem with the film, it was too one dimensional in all aspects. While it offered many good scenes and very good choreography for the acting and fight scenes as well as some really nice scenery the screenplay was a major let down. Still better than the Angelina Jolie Tomb Raider films. Oh and I really liked Nick Frost's character He should have been somehow Lara's sidekick the whole movie.",Tomb Raider

119,eva3si0n,Making a good movie on the game is difficult,3,4 January 2021,"Making a good movie on the game is difficult, making a good movie on the 2013 Tomb Raider game is very difficult. The original source in quality was below average. Except in the film there is no third of what was in the game. Ultimately, the film slips into a parody altogether, in which it is unclear whether the film originally wanted to be shot as cheaper and easier as possible or whether the film is counted strictly on fans of the series. The main antagonist is devoted to less than 5 minutes of timing, the conflict is not revealed. Judging by the installation, the action of the film unfolds on a small island, where there is nothing except the tomb. And the end of the film, in which the hint of a sequel causes longing. Please, it is not necessary.",Tomb Raider
120,TheTruthofItIs,A boring actioner,3,23 April 2020,"This was one of the more boring actioners I've seen in quite a while, it's simply a showcase for Alicia Vikander and her athletics. The story elements don't even make good sense at times but Alicia is right there in the screen's center. The director must adore her, they're both from Scandanavia. It's so bad that given all the crashes, stabbings, avalanches, water rapids, etc she still appears in prime-look, with barely any scratches, no bruises, no broken bones, it's just ridiculous. Again, just an admiration vehicle for Mrs Michael Fassbender.",Tomb Raider
121,CANpatbuck3664,Alicia Vikander and Entertaining Action Set Pieces Help Tomb Raider Succeed,8,23 March 2018,"This incarnation of Tomb Raider is specifically based on the reboot of the Tomb Raider video game that came out in 2014. I have played that game and I came away from it being really impressed and hopeful for this movie (I picked it up on sale last year). So one of the things I was able to notice was how they did a good job of bringing in specific parts of the game and weaving them in organically. They borrow several of the action set pieces from the game and Lara uses the same weapons and tools. But the key thing is that they do it well and having played through the source material, they called back to it for the fans but you wouldn't be missing anything if you haven't played the game.Tomb Raider is another example of a project where casting talented actors and actresses makes the difference in making the material seem more believable. I initially thought Alicia Vikander was an odd choice for Lara, she's known better for acting in serious drama and this is a departure from that. But she nailed the role, she carried this movie instead of just slipping in as a cog. The supporting cast capably filled in their parts too. Dominic West was an improvement as Lara's dad over previous performances in the Tomb Raider series and he brings some genuine emotion and regret as Lord Richard Croft. I also enjoyed Daniel Wu as Lu Ren. I wish he and Alicia had a few more scenes together before they got to the island because they worked well together. The only disappointment was Walton Goggins and it wasn't his fault. He's such a fun actor to watch when he's on screen but he's so toned down it was like stripping a superhero of his powers. He's not bad, I just wanted a more animated Mathias Vogel and the character wasn't interesting enough for an actor of his calibre. I also want to credit Nick Frost and Kristin Scott Thomas for making the most of the material they're given to work with.Being an action/adventure film, the next thing that's on the checklist is that has to be there is some cool action. I wouldn't call this the next John Wick but Tomb Raider does have some thrilling moments. The beginning fight scene was a little choppy but the rest of it was fun to watch. The bike chase, the deserted plane and her fight in the jungle were all noteworthy and handled well. They lack the humour that something like Indiana Jones has but the set pieces are inventive enough and highlight this new version of Lara's strengths beautifully.I've been happy to praise Tomb Raider up to this point but there were some negatives that I'm going to point out. This movie could have benefited from some organic humour, Tomb Raider's jokes fall flat for the most part. One of the things that makes Raiders of the Lost Ark and the rest of the Indiana Jones series special is the fact that they can sell Indy as a bad@$$ action hero in one scene and in the next scene he's incredibly funny. A meta crack or two would have helped Tomb Raider float through some of the absurdity of the plot. The next and the biggest problem is that Tomb Raider can't parkour around some of the small plot holes as easily as Lara does around traps. From the motivations of some of the characters to the decisions that Lara, Richard, Mathias and Lu Ren make, there were some baffling choices. They didn't wreck the movie for me but they were big enough that I had to bring them up.I do want to finish by saying they took a unique turn with the ending that was pretty clever. A lot of movies in this genre are content to chalk things up to spirituality or magic when we get to the ending (the video game does but you don't mind it so much in the game). Tomb Raider takes a different direction with trying to being a little more practical and bring it closer to reality. This was definitely a nice touch and I appreciated that.Even though I would describe Tomb Raider as I movie I enjoyed instead of loved, when I was sitting in the theatre, I found myself wondering why we can't have more movies like it. I love adventure movies and while this movie borrows from the classics, they do some fresh things to separate from the pack. It seems like a genre that could use some more attention and I understand bringing in Tomb Raider to fill that hole. I think the cast and the action lift this movie over the problems the script has. If we're lucky enough to get another one (which isn't a sure thing, the box office returns for Tomb Raider so far aren't going to blow anyone away) hopefully they learn from this one. I still recommend Tomb Raider to fans of the franchise and newcomers alike. I'd put it somewhere between an 8-9 but I can't go all the way up to 9 so I'll round down to an 8/10.",Tomb Raider
122,statuskuo,Meh,4,18 March 2018,"The original movie adaption with Angelina Jolie was no great shakes, which surprised me they decided to re-boot this. After watching this one, you find yourself REALLY missing the days when you were allowed to plant tongue firmly in cheek due to the camp value.
Though I have not played the 2013 re-boot of the game itself, it seems odd that they would change storylines to suit...the new generation of gamers. Perhaps this has been done already, but it hasn't improved the outline, and in some flaccid way, almost diluted it from an already weak Indy Jones rip.
Alicia Vikander plays this Millenial Lara Croft. A troubled rich kid posing as a working courier whilst attempting to afford to pay for mixed martial arts training. She doesn't enjoy her wealth, nor the possibility it could bring. Instead, she chooses to live within the dregs of society, desperately turning her back on society and frustrating who I believe to be her step-mum Kristin Scott Thomas. Unfortunately, you already sense the turns and reveals that movies like this can't let go. Flashbacks to conversations that is already figured out by...everyone and their grandmas. This movie is so lackluster it sensed how bad it was when within the same scene the stakes of world destruction is met with the silliest of solutions to push forth into the tomb. Makes ones stomach turn.
There is no grand adventure here. In fact, it's full of one bad decision after another. Silly and dumb without camp. The original was silly and goofy, but at least Angelina Jolie seem to enjoyed her time donning the form fitting brassier. Alicia may not understand, despite her Academy win, that it is okay to tell the money people that their ideas are garbage. Or maybe t's a payday for something else going on in her life. I can't blame her for that. Maybe tomb raiding to her means cashing a fat check at the bank.",Tomb Raider
123,trinaboice,Alicia Vikander has never looked better,7,19 March 2018,"Grade: B+In a Nutshell: 
Based on the 2013 video game reboot, this origin story to the franchise shines a spotlight on the talented Oscar-winning Alicia Vikander who looks absolutely amazing. She does all kinds of ridiculous stunts, but they're believable because she's in such incredible shape. The 2013 Tomb Raider video game won ""Game of the Year."" While this movie probably won't win any awards, it's fun family entertainment that I got a kick out of.

Things I liked:
Kristin Scott Thomas, Dominic West, and Walton Goggins join Alicia Vikander in rounding out the talented cast.
This is the second time Dominic West has played Alicia Vikander's father. The first time was in the movie Testament Of Youth.
There are some fun moments like in Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark .
They filmed in South Africa and England.
Some good stunts, although I hate the fake leaping antics.
Suspenseful torm scene in the ocean.
A few clever clues to figure out. I wish there had been more. I really enjoyed the mystery of The Da Vinci Code.
The beginning of the movie had two good scenes to introduce Lara's feisty character and skilled athleticism: the boxing match and the bike race.
Things I didn't like:
I thought it was hilarious when they were down in the tomb and the team kept whipping out ladders, lights, and other equipment, yet no one was ever carrying anything. Ha ha
Some silly jumps and scares that were super cliché.
You don't have to see this in 3D. The original is just fine.
Lara made some dumb choices that drove me nuts.
Lara hangs by one hand. A lot.
The logo doesn't make sense...the arrow line starts halfway through the title image.Funny lines:

129,PyroSikTh,Well it's not Terrible,6,20 March 2018,"Apparently this smooshes together the plots from the first two games in the rebooted series. It treads the very similar ground of a young woman with a proclivity for puzzles losing her stupidly rich father on one of his expeditions. After cutting herself off from her family fortune for seven years, she stumbles on his research and endeavours on a quest to find him, despite him being presumed dead. Cue dangerous island, mysterious organisation antagonist, and even an Asian sidekick (who does practically nothing).This is a really safe movie. It eschews away from the supernatural element beyond a couple of foreboding warnings, it sticks fairly closely to it's simplistic plot, and throws in a bunch of interesting action sequences that range from hugely entertaining to somewhat cliché. As far as video game movies, it seems to have worked by making one of the best received adaptations so far (an assessment I disagree with, but hey-ho).Lara Croft. She's clearly the big pull for this movie (as well as the two games series' and the previous Angelina Jolie movies), but without too much experience with the source material I can honestly not judge on how accurate she is. She's painted as daring and adventurous, with a mental capacity large enough to help her outsmart everyone around her, from the offset. Although that said, she also displays elements of stupidity and ignorance, such as running off to find her father without signing for her fortune, instead opting to sell a family heirloom for way less than it's worth, or trusting a shifty-looking group of young Asian men for directions when they're clearly looking to mug her.She trains kickboxing, and she's a cycling courier with few regards for the rules of the road, but I still couldn't buy her athleticism. Vikander, despite showing some musculature at the beginning, still doesn't look athletic enough to be able to do what she does later on in the film, and for some reason that really bugged me. She has the ability to completely shrug off debilitating wounds like a superhero, and can outshoot mercenaries with assault rifles just by using her bow and arrow. In some ways I felt like I was watching an action movie from the 90s, but without any of the cool bits. That said, Vikander does do a great job on the acting front, which is entirely unsurprising. While her Lara Croft often appears superheroic, she's not entirely infallible, makes a metric ton of mistakes and pays dearly for them. Vikander could definitely be the next Tom Cruise when it comes to shouting, screaming, and general sounds of pain.Walton Goggins is a really good antagonist as well, for what he is. He's cold and unflinching, and yet without any real gimmicks. Although he does keep harping on about how lonely he is having no-one to talk to for seven years, despite having a small army of militia and a slew of slaves under his charge that he could've spoken to at any point in time. Dominic West is unremarkable as Richard Croft, Daniel Wu is completely useless as Lara's sidekick, and Kristin Scott Thomas and Derek Jacobi have nowhere near enough screen time.The action is really good though. This is where ninety percent of the film's entertainment value lies and, I can't lie, it delivers. Okay, a race against time to find a key while the floor is disappearing beneath them is about as cliché as it gets for a movie like this, but solving it with clues and riddles at least makes it somewhat more enjoyable to watch. Amusingly the best action sequence of the whole movie is insubstantial to the plot, involving Lara playing a ""fox"" in an urban foxhunt through the city, tailed by a horde of hungry cyclists. Even Lara evading a waterfall via decaying old plane was pretty entertaining.The music is good, if unremarkable. Junkie XL is a great composer, but here he just felt like he was riding on the popular coattails of Hans Zimmer with big brass BWAMs that are so in right now. There's even a moment where those brass BWAMs sound a lot like that other musical in-thing in movies where the note frequency slowly slides down a la the border crossing in Sicario or the final moments of Life. It's a really cool and effective musical motif for sure, but it's starting to feel cliché. This is me being super nitpicky though, if you couldn't tell.Tomb Raider is entertaining enough. It's not a complete disaster of a movie like it could've been, but it's not particularly remarkable either. I certainly wouldn't rush out to watch a sequel, but I also wouldn't complain about one either. This is a strictly above average affair, so I give it an appropriate 6/10.",Tomb Raider

Vikander is ice cool but miscast and the plot wasn't good in the videogames it certainly isn't good here. The dialogue is awful and everything is painfully cheap, dialled back and the colour of a cartoon.

136,namstonk,Nothing new and to be honest done very badly.,1,30 May 2018,"I was hoping for a nice 'leave your brain at the door' and simply enjoy. However, lord have mercy, to say it's infantile is an understatement and boy has it been done all before, but better. If the market for this film is the average thirteen year old, then it just might work for you, if not, do not bother. The stereotype is probably the more annoying than the script, (could be very bad for the upcoming Captain Marvel), the questions that you start to ask after the first five minutes, this is not a spoiler but a battery that keeps its charge for eleven years, you have to question. The full storyline is moth-eaten with holes a plenty and the director should change his name to Timid Uthaug as it certainly didnt ROAR, admittedly this isnt neccessarily his fault, he took his chance etc. 
The main villian is of course MGM who decided on whom to pick for this film in its entirety, you'll just keep questioning the whole film, the silly dialogue, the terrible acting, fact after fact that are laughable, but on the whole the nonsensical script. Just because you HOPE the outcome may be exciting, it doesn't mean you cant have the cinema goer questioning why you'd do that in the first place though. All in all just another film with a cliché woman as the lead, hopefully we'll get another Ellen Ripley character back in the cinematic world soon.",Tomb Raider

This is Like Reboot Like To Any Another Movies Like James Bond To Different Franchise To Another In Here The Movie Focused On Lara Croft Early Days. Which Means The Movie Was More of An Origin Story of Lara Croft. Story Follows Lara Croft (Alicia Vikander) makes a living as a bike courier, she trains MMA as well Witch I Thought She Should get Very Series for Her MMA Career. But Anyway Story Doesn't Follow MMA anyways, She Is Following the disappearance of her father Richard Croft witch Lara reluctantly accepts and Founds access to her father's office. There she finds a Pr-recorded Message from Richard Croft (Dominic West) detailing his Research Into Himiko, The Mythical Queen of Yamatai who was said to Command The Power Over Life and Death. Richard Warns Lara to Destroy all of his research he has but Lara decides not to so she can Investigate Further. She goes to travels to Hong Kong she founds Lu Ren (Daniel Wu) Into the Badlands, captain of the ship Endurance his character play's Drunken Boat Captain That's How I Should Put It That Way he then Agrees to go for Adventure to Devils Sea to the island of Yamatai, The ship capsizes in a violent Crazy storm and Heavy Rain Lara is washed ashore where she is knocked unconscious. she gets Rescued from
member of Trinity's she wakes up and meets Mathias Vogel (Walton Goggins) Justified, Shield, Django Unchained, Hateful Eight. He play's really good villain in this movie I Would say he is a better villain to Ciarán Hinds Jonathan Reiss witch i thought he was lamest Villain In Tomb Raider Cradle to Life, Mathias Vogel the leader of an expedition to locate Himiko's tomb. The expedition has been funded by a shadowy organisation called Trinity that seeks to harness and weaponise Himiko's power. he has all Prisoners digging holes to find Himiko. now this movie has a lot of fun action a lot of Adventure just like in game or should I Say action/adventure movie that will remind you a little bit of Indiana Jones ? Adventure style, I Don't Want to go further but there is surprised Twist of movie you don't see it coming, I Thought Action was a lot of fun just like Simon West Tomb Raider, it's pretty Watchable fun, Movie Breaks Long Dreaded Video Game It's Close To Game. Tend to Compare It With Angelina Jolie's version but this movie turns out to be they are both much better of Tomb Raider films then to Sequel Tomb Raider Cradle to Life. I Am Big Fan Of Angelina Jolie's 1st Lara Croft which was over-the-top But I Love Over Top Movies Depends Witch Over The Top It Goes For. It's Enjoyable But this one is more grounded and real for people who likes to look for realistic. to me i don't care what if it is Realistic or not but hey when movie is Unreal it's still great it's movie what do you expect ? If Movie is too Realistic then it would be BORING. That's How It Gets Entering for Everyone. I Am so Happy That Finally we got a motion picture well adapted from a game. If They Continue from Angelia Jolie Franchise then who knows I Might Like It But This Reboot is great. it's Largely Based on 2013 Tomb Raider game and Some Action Sequences Reminds me of Uncharted series. but A LOT DIFFERENT, I Thought Thing Is there is NO POINT HAVING Nick Frost in movie when he is in it like 4 minutes then at end of movie he is in it like less ? but anyway he doesn't destroy this movie. movie is not disappointing don't ever pay attention To Die Hard Game lovers this movie will NOT DISAPPOINT YOU believe me it's not really that bad of movie, The director was Roar Uthaug, a Norwegian film maker whose prior experience were directing Norwegian films. But I personally think he did wonderful job on the action sequences. but This movie needs more high voltage Action in this movie, but this needs more of action in it, but movie wasn't boring at all pretty watchable then it really gets to action, but this needs more amazing action like Simon West Flick. The special effects were good, and the CGI was done neatly & nicely. If you enjoy this kind of movie or if you are a fan of Tomb Raider games, then I think it would be satisfying. But if you want to see a lot of the tomb raiding scenes like in the previous Tomb Raiders movies, or if you are looking for the Indiana Jones quality, well this is not be too fulfilling. i wished they could of made Lara a better character not writers making her looking like a idiot. i give this 6.10 I Will Buy It On Blu Ray.",Tomb Raider

140,stevenrotherforth,"Move over Angelina, there's a new girl in town.",7,26 July 2018,"Tomb Raider I was a little skeptical going into this movie. After all the original movies featuring Angelina Jolie were no masterpieces.
This latest reboot with the utterly brilliant Alicia Vikander taking the role of Lara Croft is an entirely different animal.
I would say a more grounded and realistic take on the character but that would be pushing it a little too far.
Some of the action set pieces do push the laws of physics but it makes for a highly exciting movie.
Think of this as Lara Croft Begins. An origins story that tries to tell of how she became the bad ass Tomb Raider she is today.
The plot is basic action adventure movie formula that isn't inspiring or inventive but does set up the string of action set pieces that are very authentic to those in the video game.
There's lots of running, jumping, scrolling and the occasional fight scene thrown in for good measure.
This is where Vikander really shines. She embodies the character of Miss Croft.
She got herself into insane shape for this movie and she totally invested herself into the role. For this Vikander must be commended and why she's one of my favourite actresses working today.
There's good support too.
Daniel Wu comes straight from the Badlands to help give a hand. If you are familiar with him in his show (Into the Badlands) where he kicks ass. This further elevates Vikander's performance as she steals the show in every scene.
Walton Goggins plays the nasty generic villain along with a whole host of other talented performers to help fill out the cast list.
In truth though it still is Alicia Vikander's movie. A film likened to the recently rebooted video game. She goes from one level to another miraculously dodging death at every turn.
Director Roar Uthaug has crafted a simple minded movie that delivers in the thrills and spills department but not much anywhere else.
It's a popcorn fun fest. One that requires no cerebral commitment from its audience.
One that i surprisingly enjoyed.",Tomb Raider
141,Mike_Devine,Vikander's performance is the only redeeming aspect,6,2 December 2018,"15 years after Angelina Jolie hung up her whip and dual pistols, another actress steps into the boots of everyone's favorite British part-time archaeologist, full-time mercenary. In 2018's reboot of the 'Tomb Raider' franchise, Alicia Vikander takes her turn as Lara Croft.While Roar Uthaug's interpretation of the video game series is filled with promise, and starts out strong, it quickly fails to live up to its potential as it devolves into a typical action-adventure flick. Although, none of this is the fault of its star. Vikander fits the bill of Croft in every way, bringing her into the modern day and age better than perhaps any other actress of her era could. From the accent to the killer instincts, Vikander lives up to the high expectations set by Jolie over a decade ago. But her performance really is the one bright spot among may darker spots.'Raider' tries to establish a storyline that is more than what would normally be expected of a video game brought to the big screen. The ""father / daughter"" bond is explored to great lengths here, but Dominic West's character of Sir Richard Croft is hollow as written, and doesn't translate well here. Other supporting roles - from Walton Goggins' cutthroat smuggler leader to Daniel Lu's Hong Kong drunk-turned-seafarer Lu Ren - do not do too much to excite either. As for the actual action sequences, there are some cool scenes but many are overly CGI'd to the point where they feel cheap.Unfortunately, 'Tomb Raider' crashes and burns harder than a rusted out fuselage careening down a raging waterfall.",Tomb Raider
142,jimmycoffin-751-212853,HAHAHA What a review battle!,10,8 June 2018,"There's nothing, absolutely nothing that's close to realistic In Angelinas
Over the top Tomb Raider. It's oneliners and ultrabad acting and CGI.
following the stereotypical action melodrama from A to B.
those plastic dual weilding guns may work in a video game but onscreen it looks bloody ridiculus. Not to mention the Very Weird latex superhero clothes and all the batcave gadgets she can play around with. I Don't say this tomb Raider amalgamation Is perfect either,
It's not even close what A tomb Raider movie could be, But I was far less disappointed. It Is on the right tracks, But vbecause of the very negative misanderstood reviews around the globe Im betting there will be no follow-up in awhile. What Alicia brings to the table Is a much more down to earth and 
realistic impression of a tomb raider, just like the new games. 
It,s sooo funny how people complain Alicia Is to little to play Tomb Raider and that she can't beat a man twice her size??!! hahah what???? So Angelina Jolie could that?? say what? It's fiction, its fantasy, It's an fantasy adventure moive first of all. And Angelina is half the muscles Alicia Is. Alicia trained for this moive by professionals and angelina doesnt even sport the same psychice as Wikander does here. SHe would kick angelinas butt!
There you have your realism.
Go Sweden And go the new tomb raider even if I dont like the movie that much at all, I give It a higher score cause of the silly hate reviews, this new movie with bias that rambo is a big dude, that's why he can kill big dudes.
In the games.. Tomb Raider Is also not the biggest of girls. And she beats everything in her path. even dinosaurs and mythical demons and bosses.
chew on that all you rambo guys. And a bow and arrow is far more cool as a sub weapon then some plastic desert eagle custom guns that looks like batman took a dump.",Tomb Raider

This was the best movie of the year so far and it will most likely be the best all year.Parents this is rated PG-13 for violence but besides that if you want your kids to watch a great movie with a hot actress then this is the movie.,Tomb Raider
145,asb_deutsch,Finally a nice video game adaption which is far better than Wonder Woman,8,22 March 2018,"I watched Tomb Raider in IMAX 3D with Laser and it was mind-blowing. This resulted in images projected by Dual Projectors on the giant 42 feet high, 65 feet wide screen of IMAX, along with 12000 watts IMAX proprietary sound system that will make your hairs stand each time you see Lara Croft in action! The 3D was unnecessary, though.Vikander is great as Lara Croft and did a better job than Angelina Jolie. In fact, this movie had better depth than Black Panther. You can feel the pain in Lara Croft. The visuals are stunning. Nice action sequences with a decent story line. No forced feminism.Opinion: BoxOfficeMojo reported the BO numbers low, otherwise it should have got the crown for the number one spot. This happened to Justice League, where the collections report was shortened.Verdict: The important lesson is to get back up again, no matter how much you lost! My digital score: 7.5/10",Tomb Raider

147,DeBBss,"Finally, A Good Video Game Based Movie...",7,18 March 2018,"As a fan of Lara Croft and the Tomb Raider (2013) game, I'm impressed with Tomb Raider (Movie). I had high hopes for Tomb Raider, but I was certain it was going to be trash, but it wasn't. Tomb Raider tried to be like the game, and it was a good choice, but the movie tried too much. Tomb Raider (2013) was a 10 hour plus game, but this movie was just short of 2 hours. If you tried to do that, then there are going to be storytelling issues, and there was. The story was a bit weak, with some pacing issues. I have to mention, Tomb Raider (Movie) was the first video game based movie that was actually good, and I have to respect the movie just for that. Tomb Raider was also very questionable, there was so much unrealistic moments in the movie, but it's a tomb raider movie, so it's to be expected. I do wish that Tomb Raider was extremely brutal, like the game, in my opinion it would've been better.Story: 6/10In my opinion, Tomb Raider had a very average story, and I was very disappointed about that. Tomb Raider (2013) had an amazing story, and since Tomb Raider (Movie) was based off of that, I thought the story was going to be the stronger part of the movie. The story is an origin story, so you're not going to be seeing an Angelina Jolie styled tomb raider. This story isn't really about the tomb raiding, but more about the relationship between Lara Croft and her dad. The entire story is about Lara Croft following in her dad's footsteps to eventually find her dad, and while doing that, she gets trapped on an island. In the game they explained why they can't leave the island, because of Himiko's curse no one can leave the island, that gave a logical motive to end Himiko's curse. But in Tomb Raider (Movie) they just say that you can't leave the island. The Himiko in this movie and the Himiko in the game are totally different. In the game, Himiko was actually evil, but in the movie Himiko was good. The weakest part about the story is the tomb raiding itself. I thought the motives were on the poor side, and that the tomb raiding was put to the side, and the story just focused on Lara Croft and her father. Overall, the story was average with weak motives and poor pacing.Characters: 7/10I liked the characters in this movie, I thought they were great, except for the antagonist. I thought that the villain's motives were poorly explained and had no depth to it. In this type of movie, the villain has to be somewhat done well to have an effect on the story and the characters. I did like Alicia Vikander's performance. Alicia Vikander made everything look more brutal and realistic, which is surprising coming form a tomb raider movie. Daniel Wu who played Lu Ren did a great job. Daniel Wu made his character likable, which is odd to me due to the little screen time he got. The relationship between Lara and her father could have been done better. The relationship felt forced and unnatural if that makes any sense. I didn't feel any sympathy when Lara's father died, if Lara and her father had more time to build up the relationship, then the story and characters would've been stronger. Overall, the villain was poorly done, the relationship between Lara and her father was awkward, but the character Lara Croft was well done and Lu Ren was a likable character.Action: 9/10I really enjoyed this movie because of the amount of action. There was so many scenes that made me sit on the edge of my seat, because of how intense the scenes were. The choreography was good and it made the fight scenes more believable and entertaining. There was a lot of scenes that was straight ripped out from the game, and they made it even better. The cinematography was great and they made the island look like a paradise. The only issue with the action was the CGI. The CGI was iffy in some parts of the movie, mostly at the end. The unrealistic scenes factor in a lot, with some jumps or tumbles that make you question the movie at some points, but for some reason I liked how the director didn't care how some scenes were ridiculous. Overall, the cinematography and choreography was great, with some really intense action scenes, but the CGI wasn't perfect.Overall, Tomb Raider did a great job with turning a video game into a movie. I think it was a good choice taking this direction for a Tomb Raider movie. There was few cons, but the cons were huge parts in the movie, so the rating really went down. Tomb Raider is the type of movie to turn your brain off and just enjoy the show. I always wondered what would happen if they took Tomb Raider (2013) and put it into a movie and see if it would be good, five years later and they finally did that, and they disproved that not all video game movies are trash. I strongly recommend this movie, it's entertaining and enjoyable, anyone can have a good time watching Tomb Raider.",Tomb Raider

150,thebricks,"Not terrible, actually entertaining, but numerous plot holes and mistakes",6,18 March 2018,"I felt Tomb Raider was pretty interesting, but I wouldn't watch it again. The script was just a mess and Alicia Vikander was horribly miscast. Much of the movie was predictable and there were just a number of ludicrous plot holes and mistakes. Oh yeah, there are the cliched scenes.
1. Lara starts off the movie, apparently living in poverty in London, delivering food by bike. Why is she doing this, all she has to do is sign the forms in her lawyer's office and take over control of the company! It's a ploy to make her more of a sympathetic character but it's just ludicrous and mocks people who actually have to struggle like this. It also would have made funding her expedition much easier.
2. Lara's dad wants to find the tomb of Himiko, but apparently knows how dangerous it is. So why go in the first place? Maybe it will be explained in later movies, but his trip to Yamatai seemed incredibly contrived. Why did he go through the elaborate lengths to hide his office with all the archaeological information and items?
3. So Lu Ren's dad took the Endurance ship to Yamatai to carry Lara's dad there and disappeared. So how does the son have the ship now? Maybe I missed that part.
4. If Matthias's employers have the money to fund this dig of the island for Himiko's tomb, why not just hire a crew and spare yourself the mercenaries and all the drama? Why would they keep Matthias there instead of rotating him out, or say...replacing him because he's ineffective? He's been there for years and not found anything! He wasn't even anywhere near the right place when Lara arrived! How horrible was this outfit to begin with? Why didn't they search Croft mansion for the information they wanted?
5. Lara taking on mercenaries armed with assault rifles with bow and arrows is ridiculous, but this can be explained with the old ""it's just a movie"" adage. Why would the dad have even brought that to the island?
6. Matthias did nothing but blow rock up the entire time he was on the island. Why not blast the door to Himiko's tomb open too?7. If Himiko was so dangerous, why not just burn her body? Why leave an elaborate tomb for someone else to find?
8. There's a lot more, but the worst mistake had to be Lara going back to the pawn shop to buy the amulet back, only to also pick up a pair of handguns! This is the United Kingdom, guns are banned for civilians! Lol! I know, it's a minor detail, but it is an indication of how ignorantly written this movie was.
I felt this was an entertaining movie for the price I made, but the script was so ludicrously bad, it was embarrassing. I haven't seen a good movie in a long time, and this was adequate , but i really have no interest in seeing another one. This was just a movie that didn't need to be made.",Tomb Raider
151,eberkerbatur,It was ridiculous despite such a beautiful story (4.4),4,3 November 2019,"Brand new Lara Croft last played that role is Angelina Jolie and it's been a long time since you're shooting a new movie and I had to because I like a very striking series. I like Alicia Vikander a lot but I don't think she is a suitable character for this role especially after Angelina Jolie i think I could have another Lara Croft.The main story is good(curse of Japanese woman)but they didn't handle story well
They didn't even commit the story we saw a lot of nonsense for example, despite being injured struggled did not make much effort to heal his wound.
Visual effects were bad only a few scenes seemed nice I mean, there was a lot of nonsense, and if they were 2-3, it was okay, but it was too much.
I hope the second movie gets better",Tomb Raider
152,ginocox-206-336968,Excellent performances wasted on muddled screenplay,5,4 June 2018,"Tomb Raider (2018) combines elements which are quite excellent with elements that are quite disappointing, or simultaneously excellent and disappointing. Alicia Vikander is excellent as an action heroine - gorgeous, sexy, fit, believable as a scruffy boxer, bicycle courier, adventurer, academic and aristocrat. The supporting cast is also excellent. Daniel Wu is a top Hong Kong movie star, although I was surprised to learn he was actually born in the States. Excellent performances also by Dominic West, Walton Goggins, Kristin Scott Thomas and (briefly) Derek Jacobi. Having cast an Asian in the role which would ordinarily be the romantic interest, the filmmakers seem hesitant to develop its potential. There's no romance between Vikander's Lara and Wu's character beyond a few ambiguous glances which might be longing. The only love angle is between Lara and her father. For action picture, it ventures too often and too far into chick-flick territory. Once there, it seems uncertain as to why it's there or how to extricate itself. Every action film needs a chase, so TR offers one on bicycles, in which Croft voluntarily assumes the putatively demeaning role of a fox, pursued by a group of guys seeking a symbolic sexual conquest by grabbing her tail. As will surprise nobody, she rises above the foxy role. The 118-minute film also spends a lot of time on Lara's daddy issues, with flashbacks and tearful moments. It also spends a lot of time empowering Lara, first in a boxing match, then demonstrating her prowess on a bicycle and finally, showing she is the heiress to immense wealth, which she voluntarily refuses, in favor of thoroughly mediocre manual labor and a half-hearted pursuit of college education. That the screenplay was written by a woman is obvious. The advantages therein are considerably less apparent. Like many contemporary films, the film seems compelled to make political statements, which largely distract from the plot and pace. The female empowerment scenes seem somewhat muddled and incoherent. The film is inclusive with an Asian leading man, but doesn't run with it or even give his character much background or much to do. A lot of time is spent on a human slavery subplot which does little to propel the action. The climax introduces a sort of muddled feminist perspective of Himiko, the McGuffin. One wonders if the lack of firearms among the good guys is intended as some sort of commentary on firearm violence. The movie has a lot of loose ends and elements that are set up elaborately, only to be later squandered. The McGuffin, once found, is underwhelming and easily destroyed. A cylindrical puzzle is lost, but not recovered. Croft risks her life to save her father's papers, but it's his journal that propels the plot. Cinematography is overly reliant on CGI and jiggly-cam shots, which are very distracting and interrupt the audience's willful suspension of disbelief. A chasm narrow enough to span with a long stepladder seems to grow to triple its width for no apparent reason. A character manages to leap about four times the world-record for a broad jump. The film includes many elements that seem unnecessary or overly emphasized, such as the early empowerment scenes and human slavery, but omits several elements which audiences come to expect in action films. Vikander is very sexy, but the movie seems strangely sexless. The possible romance fizzles and she wears the same dowdy grey workout clothes though most of the film. There is no chase scene in pursuit of the objectives. The final confrontation is not really with the chief villain, but with a chief minion. Croft's combat scenes are mostly her getting beaten up.",Tomb Raider
153,ayoreinf,"Suspend your judgment, or your disbelief and go see it.",8,10 April 2018,"It's not a masterpiece, it doesn't pretend it is. It's a very well done fun, action and fantasy that happened to be a reboot of the old Tomb Raider franchise, with a little bit more attention to the actual characters on screen. It's very important in this case since the story itself is calling for suspending your judgment (or your disbelief, as its called in other places), in massive dosage. So if the characters aren't relatable the movie itself becomes boring. This one doesn't. It's filled with action to the brim, it's well shot and the CGI are up to par. In a single sentence - it's very professional. But the main thing, is the acting, which always depends on well written roles.

At least the lead actress was a good choice.,5,16 March 2018,"""Tomb Raider's"" first two cinema outings were released 2001 and 2003, respectively, in the hopeful time when many dared to believe that movie versions of video games could be truly great.They didn't justify this hope, being generic and largely forgotten by now. I, for one, only remember the random flashes of action and stupid look of the star Angelina Jolie always holding her lips open like she was a mouth breather or something.""TR"" is based on the long-running game series that had a commercially and creatively very successful reboot in 2013, hence the push to reboot the movie franchise as well.Alicia Vikander is the new Lara the adventurous archeologist, and she certainly seems like a good choice for the role. She's a good actress - better than Jolie when she donned Lara's boots in 2001. She also has this interesting trait of appearing strong and fragile at once which makes her an intriguing candidate for an action hero.She doesn't disappoint, and can certainly hold her lips together, but I gotta admit that I only liked the first half of the movie. The sections of ship in the storm and Lara escaping the baddies on the island are definite highlights, especially her in the crumbling plane over the waterfall.These are successful not only for offering adrenaline-soaked moments but showing how games really can be successfully translated to movie format.The environment feels alive and full of possibilities, we see places to climb, leap, hold on to - just like in games. It's not just gymnastics for its own sake either, it's essential part of action happening on screen.I guess cinematic games of late - from David Cage's works to ""Uncharted"" to name a few - have given many good examples of how to find the common territory between movies and video games ""Tomb Raider"" is one of the first movies to exploit it in really memorable way.I also love that the movie-Lara is not into shooting weapons. In games, especially the later ones, you get to shoot a big number of people and animals (I especially hated killing animals). Here she's rather timid when it comes to taking a life, which is cool.So far, so good, but... By the time Lara's father re-enters the story, it lives through something very bad - I suspect an insult. The quality of writing takes a definite turn for the worse, and never recovers.The lazily mixed hodgepodge of action adventure cliches and emotionally limp personal drama takes over, making even Stephen Sommers's ""Mummy"" films look like art in comparision. At least he knew how to use cliches effectively.The father and daughter section of the ""Tomb Raider"" story is too hammy for its own good but can be pardoned by being short (although reducing it to bare minimum would actually be much better).But everything that takes place in the tomb is just silly. I didn't buy any of it, nor enjoyed it as pure entertainment. Despite all these deadly puzzles and other dangers, there's no real sense of anybody being in danger - except some nameless henchmen of course.And the number of moments when one wishes to just roll one's eyes and ask ""really?"" rises steadily. Even the widely-hated Tom Cruise's ""Mummy"" does this kind of tomb raiding thing in much more convincing and captivating manner.The authors of ""Tomb Raider"" have done a typical mistake of trying to translate everything the games offer to movie format, but not improving the aspects that worked well only in games.The main example is the underdeveloped story which tries to feel realistic but can only be endured by turning to blind eye to many unexplained or silly things.Why is movie Lara is so strong, for example? She's seemingly unbreakable and doesn't even need time to recover from serious harm. Or how is she so adept at everything she tries, starting with cliff-climbing?In gaming, mostly decorative story is not that big of a problem. You can become emotionally invested just by being a part of the world, moving around and exploring everything it contains.In movies, you need reasons to care about what happens on screen, and that starts with proper storytelling which does not just try to throw everything from Indiana Jones type of movies together. And where things don't just happen because writers have lined them up like cheap sushi rolls in grocery store.",Tomb Raider

But this one is from the start, the very beginning of Lara Croft, so obviously she is not that trained.
There are some unnecessary points in the movie. Lara Croft is hanging and surviving a too many times. 
Should see but they could have made it way better.",Tomb Raider
161,darkreignn,Definitely worth your time,7,26 March 2018,"Video game movies are notoriously awful. ""Assassin's Creed"" was one of the worst abominations ever to grace God's green Earth, and ""Max Payne"" was embarrassing, to say the least. But ""Silent Hill"" was very atmospheric and the ""Resident Evil"" movies are always a fun watch, but with the aftertaste of the failure of ""Assassin's Creed"" still in my mouth, I was not really looking forward to ""Tomb Raider,"" especially since the trailer was mediocre at best. But you know what? ""Tomb Raider"" was a damn good time at the movies.Alicia Vikander plays an incredible Lara Croft, showing vulnerability and bravery in equal measure. We all know Vikander is a fantastic actress, so you already know what to expect when you walk into the theatre. She's full of personality and bad-assery, as well as a surprising amount of emotional weight - there's a scene where she kills someone for the first time that's quite powerful, if short-lived. Also, Lara is not objectified or over-sexualized in any way, which I appreciated immensely. And while not all the acting in this film is good, Vikander always satisfies and is a joy to watch on screen. She just owns the character, playing the adventurer to perfection, using all of her survival and combat skills to survive by any means possible. Vikander just makes the movie, without her the film wouldn't be half as good as it is.And speaking of combat and survival, the action scenes in this film are thoroughly entertaining. I mean honestly my heart was pounding during almost all of the action scenes in this film. There's a scene in the beginning of the movie where Lara is being chased by a number of people riding bicycles, and I had a smile plastered on my face during the entire scene - I was also clutching my chest because I was having so much fun and I was so excited and thrilled that I kind of thought my heart was going to pop from the adrenaline. Also, there's another part where Lara is trying to make her way across an old and rusty airplane that is being suspended above a waterfall; this scene was not only visually stunning, but damn thrilling. I honestly haven't had this much fun in a movie in a long time, and I don't even remember the last time I saw a film that had me so excited that my heart was pumping out of my chest. And hey, when it comes to action/adventure movies, that's some high praises.And obviously, if you are coming to see this movie, the action scenes are really what you care about. And for the most part, they are very good. There's some questionable CGI at some points, but the overall brutality of the violence is what made the action so nice to watch. This is a PG-13 movie that proves PG-13 movies don't have to hold back when it comes to violence. There are spurts of blood, people get hurt, people explode, people die in awful ways, and it's all done without being too gory or too ridiculous. Shaky camera is also something that isn't really used. There is some rapid editing during the bike scene I previously mentioned, and during a fist fight in the very beginning of the film, but other than that I really can't remember any other use of shaky camera. For the most part, all of the scenes were visually gorgeous with slick camerawork that made everything feel very fluid and easily digestible.Now, the movie isn't perfect. The pacing does feel very off throughout the entire film - the film slows down and picks up at random places, which gives the movie a very uneven feel. This uneven pacing also made the film feel somewhat boring at times, which is a shame because with better editing and pacing, the film could've been a non-stop thrill ride. But overall, ""Tomb Raider"" is a very fun film. You don't have to like the video game, or even video games in general to enjoy this movie. If you're just in the mood for an exciting adventure film, then this will definitely be worth your time.",Tomb Raider
162,Maleplatypus,Almost a waste of time,4,23 June 2018,"If it were not for casting Ms. Vikander and Mr. Goggings, it would be. This explains ""almost"" from the title. Other than that: randomly borrowed scenery from the game, dispersed here and there, some action, some yawning and a lot of screaming, moaning and whining by Lara ""the indestructible"", who cam go through anything (falling, beating, shooting, blah) and end up only being mildly scratched. Makes sense in a game, but not i a movie with high pretensions and failed delivery. Go play reboot games (or original series, for that matter) or watch Ms. Jolie as Lara. This movie is simply too lame for Ms. Vikander and the iconic game itself.",Tomb Raider
163,austin0731,A fun action film with a simple premise. Success to the video game genre,7,12 March 2018,"The new Tomb Raider starring Alicia Vikander instead of Angelina Jolie was a fun action adventure that doesn't reinvent the video game genre but breathes new life and hope to the genre. While not being the most intricate and complex in its plot in an attempt to stay true to the source material Tomb Raider delivers a fun story that can stand tall on its own. In fact, this may just be what the genre needs, simple, fun and engaging. It does not go over its head trying to shove in lore as many other video game movies do but rather strikes a balance between fan service and relatability for newcomers. This is a relatively small 'sweet spot' that I felt Tomb Raider manages to hit. Alicia Vikander was also a fresh face to be added to the franchise, she was charismatic and played a much different role than her conventional 'Oscar darling' trope. Through undergoing months of training and packing on extra muscle she was convincing as Lara Croft while maintaining the air or mystique and sophistication that Vikander inherits. Very much playing into Croft's characteristics of intelligence and agility. Knowing that she has undergone this transformation also adds believability and authenticity to her performance, allowing the audience to acknowledge her as a genuine action hero that can carry a franchise like this. On the subject of the film's action, this film was really jammed pack with video game absurdist action sequences that make the film such a fun ride. From dangling on a crashed plane on top of a waterfall, to parachuting into the canopy of a forest every action scene seemed genuinely high risk and painful. In a sense the film is not afraid to get down and dirty adding grit and realism to the over the top action. While the supporting character played by Daniel Wu had a much smaller role there was a believable chemistry that seemed to be brewing between him and Alicia Vikander Lara Croft and I can't wait to see how they take that character in future installments of the franchise. Dominic West also does a good job as Richard Croft, benefiting the audience's relatability to Lara Croft and her hero's journey. While Walton Goggins initially played a menacing villain his character was later diminished as he gains more exposure going from cold-blooded killer who posed a genuine threat to Lara Croft to the generic mustache twirling villain who happens to be an archeologist? Tomb Raider as a whole was a good time, with fast paced action and a simple premise that definitely allows new audiences to latch on without putting off the fan's of the video game and film franchise. Even though it still sneaks in a few easter eggs alluding to an all but confirmed sequel.",Tomb Raider
164,galahad58-1,Makes Angelina's Version Look Like Shakespeare,3,17 March 2018,"Angelina Jolie brought the highly popular video game to the big screen. Her versions were campy, cheesy and ridiculous - but they were a far cry better than this new version of Tomb Raider.This Tomb Raider had two very good games (recently updated) to use as resource material and it looks like the only thing that they used was the idea of the island, the ship crashing on the rocks and the look of Lara Croft. The screenwriters ignored all the great characters that were in the game that would have brought this to life, they ignored the fact that a ship needs a crew (ridiculous point number one: one person manning an entire ship), they ignored the entire Trinity aspect of the game, they ignored all the good puzzle solving techniques, they ignored the fact that Lara was wealthy and trained herself in martial arts and weapons.This movie starts out with Lara sparring and she is awful at fighting. Why? Why would you make her awful at fighting when that is the entire basis of the Tomb Raider series - that she can fight and is a strong woman who can defend herself. They have three teenage boys basically frighten her off - so she is afraid of three teenagers, but minutes later is hitting everyone (trained mercs) with a bow. The father/daughter subplot was useless and not needed in this film. It was an aspect that drug the film down. And of course, the usual find daddy alive all these years and only to have a negative outcome.The script was horrible. The writing was so juvenile and nothing was explained or written well. The direction was terrible. The acting was dreadful. The only positive was that Vikander looked the part - that was the only positive.Don't believe the hype that the ""paid critics"" were given money to falsely promote this film. You would be better served playing Tomb Raider and Rise of the Tomb Raider - you would be more entertained watching the cut scenes from those two games on your computer than watching this boring garbage.",Tomb Raider
165,asifahsankhan,"Vikander does a terrific job as the new ""Lara Croft""",8,28 March 2018,"When I first heard about the reboot of Lara Croft, I admit I had some doubts but after watching it last night, I can easily say this movie broke the long dreaded video game film curse and one of the best video-game adaption I've seen. Alicia Vikander is a kick-ass Lara Croft (not as hot as Angelina though) and the movie is fast-paced and enjoyable despite being two hours long.Here's a quick review:Lara Croft played by Alicia Vikander is a strong independent woman determined to find out what happened to her father Richard Croft (Dominic West) after his absence during her teen years. She finds herself on the island where he last disappeared trying to solve the same mystery he was after. The movie follows Lara on her adventures and explorations while her fiercely independent personality and courage are nuanced. She is the kind of woman you want to see in an action/adventure movie.What made the character stand out is the fact that she is still exploring her potential and not always on top of things. Unlike the old versions of the movie she brings out a new kind of sexy to the movie, the focus is no longer on her body or her looks, it's about her courage, her brilliance in solving mysteries and her compassion, which is a refreshing change.The director (Roar Uthaug) did a pretty good job by bringing up her genuine character, while we enjoyed great cinematography, action scenes, exciting mystery and a nice morale at the end.Lara Croft went from trapezoid-boobed pin up character to an incontrovertible feminist icon. So besides Lara there's much to enjoy in the movie. You'll like it if you don't love it.",Tomb Raider
166,amgee-89551,Good but flawed movie,5,21 June 2018,It was an average film. It's one of the better video game films. The story was abit weak. Some of the characters wasn't written good. The villain was lame init. It was well filmed surprising from the director who did cold prey. The action sequences was pretty good. The cgi was good enough. My best thing about this latest tomb raider film is Alicia Vikander performance as Lara Croft. You can tell that Alicia Vikander gave it all in this role. Hats off to Vikander getting ripped up for this role. That's commitment. The film had some good and bad things about it. I did enjoy it for most of the running time. I doubt that we will see a sequel getting green lighted anytime soon. Because it didn't do great at the box office. I would definitely watch it again. 5/10,Tomb Raider
167,Hallelujah289,"Average, but ok",5,14 May 2019,"""Tomb Raider"" is very much a video game adapted film. The plot would definitely work for a video game--find missing father, survive incredible odds and pummel all enemies to pithy one-liners. As a film though, there is a certain heroic stupidity as the filmmakers try for both a gritty realism but also stylized camp, and the two mesh together in frequently the wrong way.After surviving a waterfall Lara Croft gets impaled with plane or tree shrapnel in a rough descent. She grunts for a bit then climbs a cliff, runs a marathon, and jumps death-defying impasses, followed by intense hand to hand combat. The realism of her getting hurt is buffeted by major stunts that just don't add up. Rather much of the film goes halfsies like this, feinting to believability but then swinging to hyperbole and trying to stitch the two together by witticisms.""Tomb Raider"" is not an effective film, but it's not a terribly bad one either. The leads have their charisma, but probably none is as interesting as the villain on the island who just wants to go home. He has an alluring compromised quality that is a notch more complex than the characters of the actor, who are often attractively heroic but one dimensional and sometimes annoying. Lara Croft's character is brave and athletic but somehow lacking the quality for me to root very much for her, although the actress of course has potential.The plot is thin and not always laid out well, frequently falling on cliches to fill in gaps where expository set-up should be. The film as it stands would actually make for a good video game because of the varied locations and fight sequences and sneaking and puzzle mini game mechanics. But as a film, there is not quite enough glue for it all to be together the way it is. Lara leveled up too quickly or used some cheat codes, or the filmmakers skipped too many cut scenes we needed to see.I was too frustrated with ""Tomb Raider"" to enjoy it, but it's not such a bad action film if you can forgive a throwaway plot. Certainly the lead actress is attractive as well, and the attractiveness factor is one of the reasons the Tomb Raider character is such a favorite anyway, If we're all being honest.",Tomb Raider
168,Chalice_Of_Evil,"Alicia Vikander shows her hubby, Fassassinbender, how video game movies *should* be done...",8,15 March 2018,"Those who've been waiting for a video game-adapted movie with actual substance need look no further. Tomb Raider 2018 achieves what so many before have failed at. It's based on the 2013 reboot of the video game series, and is therefore a very different Tomb Raider to the Angelina Jolie movies. If all you care about is Lara's chest size, then this movie isn't for you. This is a film for those interested in seeing Alicia Vikander put through the wringer, bringing nuance to the Lara character and giving new meaning to the word 'endurance'.Some questioned the casting of Oscar winner Alicia Vikander in the role, and if it wasn't evident to them *before* that she was right for the part, based on the praise of her acting and her accolades, then it certainly should be after seeing the physical transformation she's undergone. She's put on muscle, sports an '8-pack' and has the physique someone would need to believably survive what Lara goes through in this film. We first meet her boxing, where she kicks butt, though hasn't yet reached her peak yet and consequently gets beaten. She also works as a bike courier and shows off some mad bike-riding skills which land her in jail.Some might question these early scenes with Lara, but they prove important in showing us the skills she possessed already, as she will come to rely on them later to survive. After meeting with Kristin Scott Thomas's Ana Miller, Lara comes into possession of a puzzle box from her father, which leads to her meeting Daniel Wu's Lu Ren, a sometimes drunk owner of a boat (appropriately called 'Endurance') who can take her to an island she needs to get to. Vikander and Wu do a good job of swiftly building a friendship between their characters, thereby establishing why they'd risk their lives for each other (which also becomes important later on).One hell of a storm later, Lara finds herself washed ashore and it's not long before she's captured by bad guys, led by Walton Goggins' Mathias Vogel, who quickly shows his ruthlessness/that he means business by executing someone. She manages to escape, but is chased into rapids and almost plummets to her death over a waterfall. This whole sequence is one of the film's stand-outs, as it shows her having to navigate dangerous territory (a rusted plane) and leads to her getting injured. Vikander doesn't get enough credit for her understated acting. She's mastered the art of 'micro-expressions' when the occasion calls for it, and conveys a wide range of emotions throughout the film. One instance that sticks out to me where her expression says a thousand words is when she's about to pull out a piece of something lodged in her midsection.You will wince and gasp as you feel every injury Lara endures throughout this movie. It's exhausting to witness, so just imagine what it's like for her to experience. A lot of action heroes sustain major injuries that would cripple most people, but walk it off like it's nothing. With Vikander's Lara, however, every injury/ache/pain is evident and clearly it takes a physical toll on her. She hasn't got 'super powers', but instead shows what a real human can be capable of when they refuse to give up.I'd been somewhat concerned about the film's 'tone' after the trailers were released that seemed to feature out-of-place 'humour' with Nick Frost's pawn shop owner, Max...but thankfully he's used sparingly and doesn't detract from the more 'serious' moments (that's not to say that Lara herself is humourless. It's quite the opposite, actually. She's got a wicked sense of humour and is very believable in her attitude, managing to have a 'tough' exterior, but also show emotional vulnerability). The film's emotional 'heart/core' is the father/daughter relationship between Lara and Dominic West's Richard Croft, which proves important to the film, and both actors do a good job of grounding things...which is just as well, since there's all this talk of supernatural stuff which could've totally ruined the otherwise 'gritty' feel of the film.An action-packed film like this requires the right sort of direction, as you need to be able to actually *follow* the action. There's a lot fast movements, whether it be running, jumping or fighting, but it's thankfully not over-edited. The payoff for all of Vikander's arduous training is right up there on the screen/clearly evident. Her fights aren't needless fancy flipping and such, but rather rough, dirty and look like they take a lot out of her (not only physically, but mentally as well, like when she's forced to take a life for the first time). She's not superhuman, but rather just the best she can be. And it's not just fighting she's skilled at, but also archery, stealth, and deadly puzzle-solving.This movie is primarily about Lara's first 'adventure' and the origin of how she becomes the Lara Croft everyone knows her as. The movie as a whole might not be the best action film ever, but as far as video game movies are concerned, it's probably one of the best (if not THE best) movie based on a video game series thus far. It's got more going for it than most (there's even a 'horror' element and a few genuinely effective 'jump' moments). What holds this film together is Alicia Vikander's performance, as she more than proves herself the right actress for the part. Unlike most video game movies, which are rather forgettable, this is one you'll be left thinking about afterwards, as the sheer strength of character Lara possesses is something to be admired, as is her stamina. I'm glad the first movie I saw at the theatre in 2018 was this film, as it didn't disappoint and I hope to see more.",Tomb Raider

This is better than that, this is at least three quarters good.Some disappointing bits, but that is expected of all movies IMHO.

171,carlos37andre,Above average for video game adaptations,6,19 March 2018,"I never played the games of the Tomb Raiders franchise, so, I'll judge the film based on my perception about the movie itself, if it works, if it's good, that kind of stuff. I strongly believe that there is a separation between a ""good movie"" and a ""good adaptation"", one can be both, but not necessarily a good movie is a good adaptation (and vice versa).So, that being said, let's talk about the movie. In fact, I think that this won't take long, the movie is fine, there is a really basic storytelling structure, with a lot of cliches, and almost nothing new. It's actually a really big ""fine movie"", you can go watch, and will probably spend a fun almost two-hour long experience. But this is it, at some point you almost can get everything that is going to happen, because you already saw that in tones of movies before.But it's a decent film, there is ok CGI, the action scenes are well filmed, Alicia Vikander is good as always. When you look back and compares it with some others recent video game adaptations (Hi, Assassin's Creed) you can truly realize what an improve this movie is (because, AC sucks hardly).In short, there is not much to say about Tomb Raider, it's a decent film, but you almost certainly will forget 99% percent of it on the day after you see it. It's really just fine.6,5/10",Tomb Raider
172,namob-43673,A good movie and brilliant for the genre,9,17 March 2018,"This is not a masterpiece, nor an amazing fantastic movie. 
With that said, this is darn entertaining and a really fun movie to watch. I have not had this much fun in the theatre since I saw Deadpool. After seeing so many really bad movies in 2017, and not a single movie I liked so far in 2018, I finally found a movie worth the ticket price - and it is a game adaption! Who would have ever thought eh? The bad? 
The script is a little generic, and a few scenes suffer for it, but this is a action adventure based on a game, I would be surprised if it was not a bit generic and cliche at times. And there was a couple of moments where CGi was not perfect and/or the directing could use some work, but the CGi here is much, much, much better than Black Panther or Justice League so no real complaint. The good? 
Within the action/adventure genre this is a top movie. And as a game adaption I would argue it is the best of its kind. That is what I based the score of 9/10 on. As a movie this is more around 7,5/10. Vikander is brilliant, absolutely brilliant. The supporting cast is great, the music great, visuals great, story (although slightly generic) is also great. Best thing with this movie though is that when you leave the theatre you will have a smile on your face. I highly recommend, but just relax. This is not a cinematic masterpiece, but it is a fun ride and go see it expecting a really entertaining action/adventure and you´ll not be disappointed. 
I would be very surprised if we do not get a 2nd instalment, because when word spreads this movie will make a decent amount of money, and Alicia have said she'd love to play the character again. To me best movie of 2018 (so far) and a much more entertaining, and better put together film, then for example the poorly written CGi monstrosity of Black Panther.",Tomb Raider

175,mr_bickle_the_pickle,Not as silly as the Angelina one...,6,9 July 2018,"This one has a more serious grounded feel than the silly and somewhat campy Angelina Jolie version. And in some ways it works. I liked seeing Lara BECOME the tomb raider. I liked seeing her not have to rely on tech or money. She just had to use her muscles and wit to survive. But as silly as the other one was, I do think it was more fun. The characters made decisions that didnt make a lot of sense. For examplel, Walton Goggin's character Mathias is supposed to be this ruthless killer. Not only do we here exposition of how he killed people but we also see him shoot a guy who takes a break to cough. So it doesnt make sense when he later keeps Lu Ren alive. Like, obviously he is one of the protagonists and he might be a possible love interest for Lara later, and thats why the writers wanted to keep him around. But logistically from the viewpoint of Mathias and his character it wouldnt make sense to spare him. I also found the action comprised of Lara jumping and then hanging off of something. They did that several times in the movie. \The CGI was alright for the most part. However, when she was parachuting around the jungle it was VERY green-screen looking. That could have been improved on for sure. Negatives aside though, its a fun enough action film to turn your brain off to. I did like Alicia Vikander in the role. And she's a lot buffer than Angelina was so it looks more believable that she would be able to run around, climb and kick-ass like she does. I think I would rate the movie a 6.5. Like, it was kind of dumb but it was still entertaining. Although if Im gonna reach for another Tomb Raider movie in the future to re-watch....it will probably be the Angelina one.",Tomb Raider
176,Jared_Andrews,Vikander infuses the character with Charm and Likability,6,8 August 2018,"The film opens with great promise. We see a much different version of Lara Croft than the superhero-like voluptuous object of desire portrayed by Angelina Jolie in the previous iterations. This Lara (played wonderfully by Alicia Vikander) is immediately revealed to be vulnerable and beatable. She trains in an MMA gym (which she can hardly afford) where her larger and more powerful opponent literally beats her soundly in a bout. She delivers packages by bicycle and participates in a dangerous and illegal bicycle chase game in which the winner earns $600 (she loses). She's charming, likable and even relatable. Of course, she is still Lara Croft, daughter of the presumed-dead billionaire, Richard Croft. Though no one has seen her father in seven years, she has long refused to accept the inheritance because that would also mean accepting that he's really gone. When she reluctantly agrees to sign the paperwork and take what he left for her, she uncovers clues of the mission that led to her father's disappearance. Through lengthy exposition told via videos made by Richard (the classic ""if you're seeing this, I'm dead"" videos that only happen in movies), she learns that she must travel to Hong Kong and find a captain whose ship will take her to an uncharted island in the dead sea. Once she arrives in Hong Kong, a group of street thugs steal her bag, so she chases them through the harbor, eventually putting her MMA training to good use and securing the bag. Then she meets Lu Ren, whose father also disappeared seven years. The two set sail for the mysterious island. Now, this all happens within the first 30 minutes of the film. Everything afterward goes downhill. They crash their ship, barely manage to swim to the island, and meet a nefarious crew of mercenaries who seek the same treasure Lara's dad sought. We witness Lara use her wits, tenacity and toughness to fight the bad guys and prevent them from capturing the treasure because it's extremely dangerous. Or something. That's all well enough, but none of the action sequences match what takes place in the beginning of the film. The opening MMA fight, the bike chase game and the chase through the harbor are shot more creatively, and they elicit more intensity than anything that happens on the island. Even scenes, like Lara hanging over a waterfall or Lara hanging over a cave's pit (she does a lot of hanging in this movie) fall flat. This is despite Vikander's best efforts. She plays the part with grit, expressing her will through her eyes and agonized groans as she is cut, beaten and knocked around by the villains and the elements. Credit director Roar Uthaug for never sexualizing Vikander, but instead filming her as an athlete. All things considered, this is a decent movie. It's certainly better than either of the two 'Tomb Raiders' that starred Jolie. What's frustrating is that it started so strongly and certainly should have been better. The villain (Walton Goggins) is dull and feels half-written. The story is unsurprising and leaves many questions unanswered that look a lot like plot holes. That said, it's a fun watch. If Vikander decides to make a sequel, I'm certainly willing to see it.",Tomb Raider
177,scb_coldsteel,Very typical Hollywood action film,6,1 October 2018,"I just saw the new Tomb Raider film in theaters. My expectations were relatively low, but I was still expecting a fun action adventure. Overall I'd say it delivered on the mindless stupid action fun.The movie had ample enough action to keep me entertained. The movie was well choreographed and shot also. It really did not disappoint in regard to basic popcorn flick entertainment.Acting wise Alicia Vikander did a solid job playing her role. She providing just enough charisma and spunk to balance out her badassness. She did a much better job than Angelina Jolie did with the role.Unfortunately the story was very cookie cutter stereotypical action. The whole plot of the movie could be predicted in about 10 minutes. It was fun, but definitely dumb. There was also a few unnecessarily slow moments in the film. Really the film could have been 30 minutes shorter.The movie also lacked a compelling villain. Walton Goggins plays the main bad guy and he does a good job, but the character is paper thin. He is a very stereotypical bad guy doing bad things because he's bad.Overall the movie was what it was supposed to be, a dumb yet fun action flick. I will say it probably is the best movie based on video game I've seen. I would have preferred if the movie had a little bit more originality though a 6.5 out of 10.",Tomb Raider

180,Slarkshark,Best Live Action Tomb Raider,8,4 March 2021,"First off, Alicia Vikander was the perfect choice for Lara Croft. She had the look, the physique, and the acting skills in order to become the well known and beloved character.The 2013 Tomb Raider game this film is based on is remarkable. I thoroughly enjoyed playing it and was ecstatic when I heard the reboot film was going to be based off of it. Although, when I saw it in theatres I left feeling slightly disappointed. I did have huge expectations as I liked the game so much, but the film strays from it in a few ways which made me feeling unsure. My other criticism, would be that some of the supporting cast were a little underwhelming, even though I generally like the actors.I have to say that I just rewatched this and enjoyed it more the second time around. The stunts looked great, and it's close enough to the source material that I'm happy. It's by no means groundbreaking, but it's surely better than the campy 'Jolie' films (remember when she punches a shark and rides it... yeahhh). It definitely would be a real shame if this never got a sequel.",Tomb Raider
181,Fields201,Source Material is Better,5,21 March 2018,"When I heard they were rebooting Tomb Raider, I was annoyed because so many other video games were being ignored (Bioshock) and felt Tomb Raider had its course. However, I fell in love with the reboot video game and I was actually pretty excited for this one. Unfortunately, it's a huge letdown.I have played the game multiple times and it is easily one of my favorite games. I understand adapting a video game out of a ten hour game is a daunting task and liberties had to be taken but they deviated far from the game.The movie starts out showing Lara's life getting her butt kicked in boxing, being broke, and reenacting the movie Premium Rush on her bike. Eventually we see that her father left her being a tape and she ends up finding the boat to the island where pretty much the game starts where the boat crashes and Lara jumps and plunges into the water. Like the game, she gets knocked out and then everything is different after that.Instead of Lara waking up hanging upside down in some cult chamber, she wakes up in some tent with someone who calls himself Mathias. In the game, Mathias is this hood wearing cult person who kidnaps one of your party members to resurrect the Sun God who is holding Lara and her crew hostage on that island. But this Mathias looks more like the guy Lara kills in the game to escape, and went nuts because she never killed anyone before she commits genocide.The only moment in the movie that steals from the game is when she parachutes from the plane. This happens early in the film and later in the game. Other than that, there is very little similarities other than her wielding a bow and arrow and going through a little of the island. The film itself looked more direct to DVD and felt very low budget. The CG is also pretty laughable.Sadly, it is one of the better video game films but that's not saying much. I wish they adapted more of the awesome moments in the game like that giant samurai monster that chases her, the wreckage that chases her, or even some of the cooler action sequences. I'm guessing they didn't want to spoil the game or make it new for fans of the game, or maybe they just didn't have the budget for all that. Who knows. I walked away disappointed, not caring at all about the characters and one significant change they made into the film from the game really baffles me. It bogs down the film in a very big way and this film could have been so much better.",Tomb Raider
182,Zedyeti,Great for a video game movie,7,28 February 2021,"Ok so movies based on video games are usually garbage but I found this one did the series justice. As a fan of the current generation of tomb raider games I found this movie stuck with the source material pretty well. It's not a perfect movie, but if you play the current games you'll see what I mean and if you don't I could see why you would rate it lower. I would watch a sequel too.",Tomb Raider
183,MinistryofDoom,The Tomb Raider is BACK!,7,3 June 2018,"There are two generations of Tomb Raider fans. There the people who loved the Ps1 generation of games the Angelina Jolie films that were inspired by them, and then there are the people who loved the Ps3/Ps4 Tomb Raider game reboot in 2013 where Lara Croft was no longer the invulnerable perfect super heroine able to leap 50 foot chasms while double-wielding Desert Eagles and landing in a split on tight rope above a pit full of poison-tipped spears. The 2013 reboot presented Lara Croft as a vulnerable sensitive and troubled lady who was eventually forced to take on her role as the Tomb Raider. She bled, she felt pain, and she wasn't physically or psychologically superior in any sense of the word. She came with a lot of flaws. This is clearly where this particular film reboot draws heavy inspiration. The film does a great job of expanding the scope of Lara's background by showing how and why she was led down the path that resulted in her becoming the Tomb Raider. Those who can't accept that are unable to look past Jolie's exemplar super-heroine version, which was basically a female lead-driven version of an over-the-top reality-defying action flick like Die Hard or Mission Impossible. Those films are great if you're able to turn off your brain and just want non-stop action from the first few seconds until the closing credits. Tomb Raider (2018) is different. It gives purpose to Lara Croft. It shows her vulnerabilities and weaknesses. It's the story of a young woman placed in extraordinary circumstances and left to fend for herself....while still maintaining the overall theme of what Tomb Raider is and should be. It humanizes Lara Croft much more than the old generation's Tomb Raider media ever did and in doing so, it creates a fierce heroine that we can support and root for. It's not a perfect film by any means, but it's a complete game-changer (no pun intended) in the world of Tomb Raider that will become the springboard for everything related to the franchise in the foreseeable future, and does so without sacrificing all the things that we love about the games and the character.",Tomb Raider
184,n-kefala,Fun action movie,6,18 March 2018,"Tomb Raider, directed by Roar Uthaug, would not be worth watching without Alicia Vikander. Angelina Jolie played Croft as an aggressive woman in her two films, Alicia Vikander sees her heroine as more vulnerable, a college-age kid who has to fight harder to come out of fights with bad men. Not knowing much about the Tomb Raider video games, I walked into the movie with few expectations. Fortunately It is a tight, fast, well-made movie that delivered exactly what it promised. Alicia Vikander's tough and tender turn as Lara Croft makes this entertaining action adventure worthwhile and she is by far the best thing in the movie. No better or worse than its predecessors. It's just a fun, lightweight action picture.",Tomb Raider
185,Breumaster,Pretty Good Reboot,7,27 February 2020,"According to the old series with Angelina Jolie, there have been plenty of things done better. The whole production design looks better, it has a very much better story than the old ones and Alicia Vikander looks more like the video game queen Lara Croft. The story parts are better, the action looks better. It simply is more coherent, more consistant than the old movies. I hope there will be a sequel.

187,rutzelb,Very Entertaining and Exciting,9,16 June 2018,"Lara Croft (Alicia Vikander) won't sign papers giving her control of her father's (Dominic West as Richard Croft) estate and businesses because she doesn't believe he is dead after 7-yrs of his leaving. She finds her father's notes regarding a Japanese island that housed a mythical sorceress Himiko with whom he hoped would help him reunite with his deceased wife. Lara sets out to find what happened to him. I don't remember much about the Tomb Raider movie with Angelina Joli so I cannot make any good comparisons, but this one is truly awesome. The only thing I do kind of remember is that this Tomb Raider has Lara more vulnerable and not such a hard ass as Joli's Lara was. And this made much more sense to me and I rooted harder for her. Wouldn't you? A lot of CGI was expertly used to create ocean storms and movable rocks housing the sorceress Himiko's tomb. On the island there is a group of men digging and blowing up the mountain to find the tomb led by a ruthless Mathias Vogel (Wallton Goggins) who is working on behalf of a secret organization called Trinity. The belief is that Trinity would rule the world once they bring Himiko back to life. Vogel tells a captured Lara that he killed Richard years ago. Lara and Lu Ren (Daniel Wu) are now workers guarded by Vogel's army with machine guns and there doesn't seem to be any way to escape. Her father is dead and she needs to get off the island. How to do that?The CGI was incredible and -for sure - Alicia Vikander was put thru a lot of physical exertions and so was I watching from the couch where I was as winded as she was. Hey, I was exhausted. Watch this and you'll see for yourself. Yes, it's only a movie but Miss Vikander had to be in tip top shape. Kudos.Notables: Daniel Wu as Lu Ren, whose ship brought Lara to the Japanese island; Nick Frost as the pawn shop clerk; Kristin Scott Thomas as Ana, Lara's former guardian and Richard's business partner. This is a very entertaining and exciting movie and the pace is perfect. This time we will - for sure - see sequels because Lara knows that Trinity has to be dealt with because she sees where her company also owns Trinity. What???? Can't wait. (9/10)Violence: Yes.
Sex: No.

190,iantrader,If you like the original movie - don't watch this,2,1 June 2018,"Just to prove you can't please all the people all of the time, my other half rated this an 8. Although she does watch soaps which, sorry, severely reduces the validity of her opinion on movies, at least as far as my preferences go. If you like soaps and aren't too demanding, you may well like this.Why oh why do people do these remakes? I don't think I've seen any that even approach the quality of the original;. Oh, money. Right, I see. Well, one can only hope this loses a lot so dumb produces aren't persuaded to do any more. But that hope will be lost in development hell. Oh well. At least it's not my money...Where to start? It's derivative - Indiana Jones, anyone? -poorly, plotted, sucky story, so-so acting, poor directing - and, yes, I did nod off during the treacherous 2nd act. At 2hrs, it's 1 1/2hrs too long!I do love a good action movie but this really wasn't it, in spite of it having many 'action' sequences. It had none of the flare and tongue-in-cheek humour of the Angelina Jolie movie and, well, the ultimate critique of any movie - it was boring.If you really must watch it, do so, but you'll get more joy from watching the original again.",Tomb Raider

192,niaz_islam,Tomb Ruiner,1,12 June 2018,"Tomb Raider was an adventurous character full of action, confidence and more importantly smartness. This film quite successfully ruins these aspects of Tomb Raider.Nowadays these kind of movies has only one goal which is to prepare the plot for the sequel. And to do so they ruin the story with flawed logic and unnecessary complications. As a bonus - this story has no solid backgrounds for its characters, they just pop up in places and do things like: fall in love and fight; it is just too painful to watch. Not to mention the absurd action scenes where Tomb fights with bow and arrow against automatic guns, as well as the scenes where good guys can easily overpower bad guys and vice versa but they did not do it just for the sake of the movie.Really disappointed. Not Recommended.",Tomb Raider

Alicia Vikander is Lara Croft, this woman took the role and made it her very own and all, I can say is she killed it. The only thing I found wrong with this movie is the script, there really wasn't any, but the action and adventure was enough to entertain and I also would liked to have seen more of the great actors that they had in this movie, particularly Daniel Wu he was there, but in a very supportive role, he's a great actor and I feel like he was a bit under used in this. Everything else was perfect, I love this movie and have seen it 4 times already and plan on seeing it a few more times on the big screen, cause this is a movie for the big screen. This movie definitely needs an Oscar nomination for best Cinematography next year. Go see this movie!!!!!!",Tomb Raider

198,paulijcalderon,A decent adventure movie,7,22 March 2018,"I was thinking of starting my review by saying that the most exciting action was the ""Premium Rush"" bike scene at the beginning. But, actually.. It's a decent adventure movie. I honestly had no expectations and in the end I thought it wasn't bad. The story of the film follows a lot of standard tropes, but none of it annoyed me. It was simple and pretty straightforward. Just never becoming anything too convoluted or cheesy. It was a pure classical adventure tale. Archetypical would be the right word. So it was fun and also, the action wasn't half bad. You felt some intense tension. Especially since they throw around Lara so much. Be ready for her to get hurt a lot. I felt kind of bad seeing her get so injured and beat up. Because Vikander looks so innocent and kind. But the moment when she goes after the bad guys you see that ferocity in here gaze. And that's when you realize: ""Yep, those guys are gonna get hurt"". It gets kind of gritty at times as well and I appreciate some of realness in the approach they went for. Obviously you are gonna have the hero moments. But they are built up decently to the point where it's earned. She is also not afraid having to get into brutal fights. Not much of a superhero, but she is a friendly and nice character. Vikander did not skip her homework here. She is very devoted and brings a fierce performance and molds the character to make it her own. I'm giving that dedicated care a thumps up!It's not without its flaws. You can easily figure where it's gonna go and important moments fly by fast. Here and there you also get that very convenient movie scene, that can only happen in the movies. Those parts get old. They didn't wanna waste time on developing certain characters and story points. I think that about 10 more minutes of development would have benefited. Walton Goggins is a charismatic actor and he took his part seriously. Not a bad job on his part. Daniel Wu was a fun addition as this drunk captain. He fades into the background towards the third act though. I guess that's not a big deal since it's Lara Croft's story after all. Once you get to the tomb you actually spend some proper time being part of the exploration. It's time to go down those dusty stone steps and look at mysterious imagery on the walls. Look out for traps, you know. And that's the stuff we enjoy. There's homages to many classic adventurous stories and I was having a lot of flashbacks to things like ""Adventures of Tintin"", Peter Jackson's ""King Kong"", ""The Mummy"", ""On Stranger Tides"", ""Indy Jones"" (of course) and even ""AVP"". Well, I'm mentioning that last movie because there's an underground temple involved that sort of reminded me of the one from that flick.Honestly not a bad video game movie. It's perfectly watchable. I had a good time with the action, set-pieces and the expedition to find this mysterious sacred thing. I was afraid of the whole: ""You are the only one who can save the world"" stuff. That's just too much of a stretch. But, hey! They played it off like ""that's just crazy talk"". Keeping it simple with fewer characters and smaller story was the right thing to do. The focus becomes more clear. They, of course, set-up a sequel. And if it ends up happening I'll be checking it out. So maybe the best video game movie I've seen? It feels weird saying that, but I wasn't annoyed by it. Check it out! Besides you will feel like taking part of parkour bike racing in the city.",Tomb Raider

And at the beginning of the film a lot of good was shown and we managed to establish the character properly, even though the order of the scenes was questionable.
All the time I thought it was so bad, this is a nice afternoon ProSieben film but the cut could be a little slower.As soon as the film really starts and we come to the island, it becomes absolutely stupid and chaotic. The effects look even worse than from the video template. During her chase she has so many accidents that you would have killed at least 20 times and at the beginning it was shown why she can fight a bit but where can she get all the acrobatic masterworks of all Cirque du Soleil.
It's called Show don't tell, but nothing was shown to us here and nothing was told that we should just get along with the fact that she came
This pseudo deep narration gets on my nerves and Hollywood has been trying to hit feminism with a mallet for a long time is not okay.
I am tired of seeing women beating their way through a male-dominated world again and again and that with completely unrealistic measures that would not be manageable for a trained person. The whole thing would be a lot more serious if I were all stupid like straw around them .
I know that this film happens more on modern games, which I think is good too, that's why we have more physical action and more with bows and arrows, but the modern games are a lot brutal and this is so softly cooked and boring I never have the impression had. That our Lara was ever in danger and since she calculated everything as if she had the Ultra instinct is even more unrealistic.
Generally, I understand why Hollywood films have a problem with hurting the characters or making them look bad, they get through everything without a scratch because I don't think the modern Lara Croft games were so nerve-wracking because there was something on every corner Guys could or who had been seriously injured and you had to split up your western energy to get through this is the main problem that this film lacks.
And who doesn't love to have redcon in the same film.
it would be a pretty good emotional thing if Lara Croft's father were actually dead, but in the middle it stands out that you are still alive.
somehow Disney is the only company that is constantly pulling parents to die and who really have the balls that the parents stay dead even though there is magic at Disney.
Why must there always be doomsday plots? Every film always has some dangers that lead to global destruction, that is unrealistic.
yes I know this is an entertainment film and no documentary but not even the Indiana Jones films have been so exaggerated that the hunter of the lost treasure was very vague as to what will happen you didn't know what was going to happen and the other two films did not have it now all mankind destroyed.
this is generally a thing that I do not fully understand if the whole world / humanity is destroyed what does it bring? Where do the bad guys want to live?

Many have tried, and none have succeeded. Even ones with outstanding talent behind it, such as Assassin's Creed, have fallen completely flat on their face. And with each upcoming video game movie, we all hope it will be the one to break the curse. For a while, I thought Tomb Raider could be the one. It stars Alicia Vikander, who won an Oscar for her performance in The Danish Girl. She plays Lara Croft, the daughter of a missing adventurer. When signing her father's will, Croft discovers a clue that leads her on a mission to an island where she must stop Mathias Vogel (Walton Goggins), the leader of a mysterious evil organization called Trinity.

Lara Croft character is intended to be developed on the relationship with her father and her common situations and conditions in the ordinary life. She will decide to take a trip, so to begin the adventure of the story in the classical games manner. The narration is enjoyable enough. Right, the choice to avoid Lara acts as a superior hero in order to make her much more natural and human. What I would like to see in the movie: the explanation about some intellectual abilities and the way how Lara got her knowledge. Indeed, it seems that Lara is able to solve enigmas without any kind of study, if not her intuition and some past experiments. Her historical apprenticeship and her studies doesn't justify her ability to solve enigmas, such as to face a new past culture. If the director or the screen player of this movie had showed the difficult to solve the enigmas by any trace got during the unfolding of the story, the movie would have benefit in mystery a lot. The story is good in action respecting the logical order of events as well, but misses the attention to the mystery. Some banal choices makes the movie a bit unreal, such as the unreasonable support in the end Lara gets, so to explain her rescue. The choice to explain the magic in the myth of the past culture with the logical explanation by the evidences got by modern knowledge is right, and matches the Tomb Raider games storytelling.",Tomb Raider

The villain is one of the weakest I've ever seen and shows barely any significance and the cgi is pitiful usually which is flabbergasting for a near 100 mil budget. Some of the acting was just down right mediocre and unconvincing. The Himiko storyline could've been expanded upon and was a missed opportunity that had major potential.

The plotline doesn't even try very hard to hook you, nor try to bring you into its story. It just sort of passes you by and keeps going its merry way. The acting is fine, no complaints here. Daniel Wu's character exists only to provide a warm body to help move the story. The best drawn character is, ironically, the not-so-evil villain played by an unusually restrained and real-feeling Walton Goggins, who usually plays so way over the top that he's gonzo.

Daniel Wu was a nice add and I hope he'll appear in the later TR movies. I started at 10 stars and automatically deducted 1 star because the plot was a cliche. That I didn't appreciate.

The on-screen Lara here just doesn't do enough to connect with the audience, so the stakes are non-existant, the bad guy is frankly hilarious in how seriously the guy playing him is taking it, and the location and effects just feel far too.... false. The game on which this is based has a delicate character arc, starting with Lara as a uni student on an adventure where everything goes horribly wrong and she has to adapt or die. This is important, as it shows Lara learn how to survive because she has to. None of that is here, instead we have a hunt for Lara's father, and then now suddenly after a fight in some mud and a sleep Lara is some sort of badass amazonian archery master. Erm... hang on did we miss a few years? This could all be forgiven if the action was entertaining, but as previously mentioned it all looks too much like shiny CGI, with impossible physics and odd lighting. It looks almost like a game, which I suppose is rather apt. Overall the filmmakers have taken some beats from the games, but sadly not the ones they needed to.

212,tmpsvita,More than taken from a videogame seems taken from an useless gameplay,4,26 March 2018,"I have not seen the two Lara Croft with Angelina Jolie and I have never even played any of the videogame chapters that have made this character a phenomenon that has created a vast Fandom for several generations, but surely this ""Tomb Raider"" will not let me approach at the same named video game. 
A film that does not even try to distinguish itself from any of the numerous adventure blockbusters that preceded it, adding practically nothing new or particular to the genre, everything has a bitter aftertaste of already seen and inconsistent.
The action scenes are trivial, flat and do not involve because of an increasing predictability, most of them is confusing, badly directed and absurd to say the least, like almost the whole film.
The screenplay does not have the slightest depth but is full of inconsistencies and situations without any logic or linked to each other with many forcing, the holes are really too many and the dialogue barely endure.
Even the direction is not saved by being terribly chaotic, sickening and without the slightest personality.
So there is practically nothing to remember this mess, the same Alicia Vikander does not convince much, not to mention Dominic West that in every shot in which he appears seems a character emerged out of a mediocre parody.
To conclude, a trivial, patinated and predictable movie that does not involve and does not deserve to be remembered except for its faults that are all too visible and its embarrassing dialogues.
I hope for a better sequel, always if it will be done, because this more than a fun adventure movie taken from a video game looks like a bad and boring movie taken from an useless gameplay.",Tomb Raider

Sure he character didn't seem like she wanted to be seen as a sex symbol. But just because she seemed less curvy than Angelina Jolie, doesn't mean they didn't cast or would have cast gorgeous actress for this role. The issues: The style was still over the top even if it seemed gritty and raw at times. Apart from it having a female badass, and virtually no humor, it wasn't too different from all the other action adventure treasure searching adventure movies. Given that the style wasn't realistic in the slightest, it would have been better if there had been humor. It also felt like a few of the flashbacks were redundant.

217,jeannefrancoise,Alicia Vikander is Lara Croft,7,9 March 2018,"Dear readers, Lara Croft image for me is still Angelina Jolie, as her face was everywhere in the game poster in everywhere rental place/room of Play Station, so that we are expecting differently for the acting of Alicia Vikander. Her acting was great, always brave, spontaneous, humorous, kind, and stoppable, as her role is to find her father and complete the quest. For me, Alicia Vikander is too skinny and not so sexy as Angelina Jolie, but with the fast plots, we can appreciate Alicia Vikander can do anything in this movie, she never cries and she never kiss a man. Well, in this movie there is a role-play actor also who helped Lara Croft to find her father, but the character is not developed so much. Alicia Vikander as Lara Croft is the main role and she leads every decision, although each decision her made, leads her to many danger things. We are assuming that this new version of Lara Croft is more romantic and more feminine, but the nurture of Lara Croft remains in Alicia Vikander skinny figure. Don't worry, the fighting, shooting, crawling, jumping, and even flying, Alicia Vikander proves herself as a talented actress. She might get other role in many action movies ahead. I appreciate also the wardrobe team and setting team, that can live up the scenes are so adventurous and this movie is becoming not just action, but an adventure: there is old Japanese paintings, woods, island with no lives, etc, that might us to remember Pan's Labyrinth, Hugo, and Peterpan where the main actor is still young. The archery image on the poster here is look like Hunger Games, even though the ending is quite different. In Lara Croft, there is unexpected ending, but the plots are still predictable and some story is boring, especially the villains are not so scary and not-so-criminal. The ending is trying to gives the meaning of conspiracy, but failed, because it does not show up from the beginning. Well, for me, the ending could be replaceable. But we have to appreciate this new version of Lara Croft, new cinematography with more modern images and plots, and somehow is more millennial than before.

This film is based on the gritty reboot Lara game of 2013 & skillfully incorporates the features that made the game stand out. The cinematography, set design and stuntwork is pretty amazing. Alicia Vikander as Lara Croft is phenomenal, does a lot of the stuntwork herself & was able to embody the mental, physical & emotional strength of Lara.

219,garethvk,Slow To Get Started But Better Than The Two Prior Films,7,16 March 2018,"The third film in the ""Tomb Raider"" film series has arrived and much like
the recent entries in the video game series that inspire it; the film
serves as a reboot of the franchise.
This time out Alicia Vikander takes over the title role from Angelina
Jolie and brings us a younger and far less experienced Lara Croft who
toils as a bike messenger struggling to get by in London. She has a feisty
and competitive nature but is haunted by the absence of her father
(Dominic West), who has been missing for seven years and is presumed dead.
As such, Lara is his sole heir and is being pressured to sign documents
that will legally declare him dead and turn over a vast corporation and
fortune to Lara. True to her nature, Lara resists this as she is
unwilling to move on from her father and cannot bring herself to declare
him dead and take her inheritance.
In time Lara learns that her father was also a dabbler in the supernatural
and artifacts and may have vanished trying to find a secluded tomb on a
remote Japanese island.
Undaunted, Lara sets off to get answers and finds herself in the company
of a boat Captain named Lu Ren (Daniel Wu), who reluctantly takes her to
the dangerous island. Danger arrives first in a storm then in the form of
a Mercenary named Matthias Vogel (Walton Goggins), who wants to find the
mysterious tomb as well for nefarious reasons and will stop at nothing
including murder to get it.Lara is soon faced with the fight of her life as she must battle Vogel and
his men as well as the island and other forces in order to survive and
protect the world.The film moves at a pace slower than you might expect as the first half of
the film is mostly setup but there are a few moments of action included to
keep things interesting. While many of the action sequences may seem like
they are either restrained or influenced from other films, they do still
work and entertain. While some may call this a female ""Indiana Jones""
film, Lara is very much her own character as she has a spunk and grit that
makes her equal adapt in a cultured setting as she is solving a dangerous
trap or mixing it up with deadly threats.Vikander also portrays Lara with a sense of vulnerability as she does get
injured, bruised and tormented. This is not an unstoppable action machine,
but rather a real person who knows there is a time use your brain and then
a time to take action, but is also remorseful about the consequences of
her actions at times.The film does move to a satisfying finale and sets up a further chapter
very well. There are some great nods to prior games in the film which was
refreshing as I joked to my wife during some of the more intense scenes
that I feel like I need to be pushing the X and O button on our Dualshock
4 controllers to help Lara run faster and jump higher.In the end ""Tomb Raider"" is a satisfying if safe reboot for the franchise
that I expect should keep fans of the series happy. I do think that
audiences in North America may want a bit more action but the film should
play well in the Asian and European markets.3.5 stars out of 5.",Tomb Raider
220,Veritas99,Just. Boring.,4,18 March 2018,"First of all, Vikander is not a good choice for Lara. She looks weak, fragile, vulnerable, yet her character manages to fight, wounded, with strong, armed men...C'mon...She looks like a wet mouse trying to escape from a flood...she has not the charisma that Lara Croft should have- Jolie did it much better.
Then the plot...she refuses to accept her inheritance, lets her family house become a ruin, to spend her life delivering food by bycicle... C'mon again...
More...she needed money to go to find what happened with her father...again, she refuses the inheritance, but she sells the only object she had left from her father...Really?

As far as video game adaptations go, this is fine. One of the better video game movies ever made, actually, but that's not saying very much. I'd say just skip this one and stick with the games and the Angelina Jolie movies. They are technically worse films, but they are more fun and memorable.",Tomb Raider
225,Field78,Now this is how you make Raiders of the lost Tomb!,8,30 March 2018,"I am usually careful in venting a positive opinion of a movie that is generating such polarized reactions, since trolls who thrive on destroying good feelings are everywhere. However, on the last check, 2/3 of viewers award this movie with a 7 or higher, so I think it's safe to assume that I am not the only one who thoroughly enjoyed it.I hear people rejoicing in the believe that this movie has broken the curse that seemed to rest on video game adaptations since the beginning. While I feel that not every game adaptation has been completely bad (Assassin's Creed was very enjoyable until that rushed-through third act, and I liked a few Resident Evils), most were indeed disappointing or mediocre at best. And although this Tomb Raider corrects most of what was wrong with the previous Angelina Jolie-vehicles, one solid film doesn't necessarily mean that the next one won't be an easy cash-grab. It can also mean that someone simply did a good job, for once. But let's hope that this is the start of something good.That this movie turned out so good is a pleasant surprise, given the fact that there are no big names behind the cameras (save for my fellow Dutchman, composer Tom Holkenborg of Mad Max Fury Road fame). I've never heard of the screenwriters or director Roar Uthaug, who rivals Gore Verbinski for having the most interesting name in the business (almost sounding like a Star Wars character). This being his Hollywood debut, he sounds like the kind of guy who would be the target of fierce studio interference, but it is to the film's credit that it doesn't feel unnecessarily compromised in any way. I hear a lot of criticism directed at a poor story, bad performances, laughable quotes and crappy special effects, but I cannot identify with any of that.Beginning with the story, there is nothing extremely innovative or deep here, but this is first and foremost an action movie. I can handle some coincidences and suspensions of disbelief like I did with the Indiana Jones movies. Although the excellence of those films isn't matched, it is good to see that the story is definitely more than a string of MacGuffins that glues the exotic locations and action scenes together. Lara's relationship with her father even gives it a bit of heart and motivation, and the title is aptly chosen, as a secret tomb containing a mythological queen is the object sought after by all parties. Without spoiling too much: the question about the facts and fiction of ancient mythologies is one of the better plot elements here. Especially the third act fortunately isn't ruined by lots of hocus pocus just for the sake of a climax. I never thought I'd say this, but this movie is probably as grounded in reality as the genre allows.Much has been said about re-casting Lara Croft with the less voluptuous Alicia Vikander, but it is a change that fits in the recent re-imagination of the character in the games, as well as the re-invention of women from teenage boy fantasies into genuine action heroes. Lara's attire is still less than covering, but you won't find the obligatory bikini moment or shower scene. Vikander is a great choice: she has the cute looks, she can be funny, she can show both vulnerability as well as toughness, and it is clear that she did the majority of the bone-breaking stunts herself. Some people complained that she came over as near-superhuman, but I think they should watch again. Lara is far from the established and invulnerable genius she was in the previous films, and Alica really has to earn the audience's respect. The movie starts out with a strung-out Lara without a college education, who gets into trouble, gets beaten up, run over, and whose only skills include archery and a fierce determination to find her beloved dad. Over the course of the movie, we see her getting punched, kicked and otherwise injured (WITHOUT the use of her trusted guns, I might add), and change from an insecure tough girl into a genuine powerlady. This is a character development that is a genuine rarity in such game adaptations. Dominic West and Walton Goggins (also the targets of unjust criticism) give her some nice counterweight as her caring father and the cold bad guy respectively. But the cherry on the pie comes from some deliciously funny supporting roles by Daniel Wu and Nick Frost. Especially the latter I can see growing into an audience favorite.As for the action and special effects, if some found it unconvincing, I didn't see why. We get a great bike chase in the beginning, as well as some painfully physical fight scenes that almost made me feel sorry for Alicia. Although the action and set-pieces become progressively more exotic, dangerous and grand-scale over the course of the movie, it is still good-old popcorn fun without getting too much over the top or overly fake with visual effects (save for a brief parachute scene, perhaps). It also feels pretty pertinent to the plot instead of strategically placed to keep the audience awake.The only real criticism I have would be the seriousness. There are some funny parts (especially featuring Nick Frost) but I would have loved just a bit more humor to balance out the darker parts of the story. And that final scene was a bit too much of a teaser to a sequel. At this time, the movie isn't performing exceptionally well commercially, so it remains to be seen if we will ever get a part two. But if not, we will will always have this one as proof that you CAN make a game adaptation with just enough brain, heart and bravado to not miss the controller in your hands.",Tomb Raider
226,tvdefrancesco,Definitely a Let Down,6,1 May 2021,"When I think of Lara Croft I think of a smooth, fearless, confident, and bad a$$ tomb raider. An over the top dual pistol poppin Indiana Jones.

She goes from working for DoorDash essentially to killing mercenaries in the jungle in a couple of days. Her father watches her murder someone and doesn't bring it up even though it's the first time he's seen her in 7 years. Instead he asks where she went to University.Script was terrible. I don't blame Alicia Wilkander, Walton Goggins, or Jimmy McNulty at all. They tried but couldn't overcome terrible writing. They tried to make it too realistic. Half the fun of Lara Croft is how over the top she is. She's a rich, smooth, cocky, brilliant, and deadly beauty.

227,ravenclaw_girlrules,In awe of the positive feedback,5,17 March 2018,"As someone who spends much of their free time surfing through Netflix originals, my standards are about as low as standards get. However, this movie surpassed nearly all of them - in the worst way.First, characters: Lara is an infallible God who is apparently immune to physical injury and flawless in every way. Lara is the opposite of relatable - she can leap over 30 foot gaps and climb up slippery rock faces with an open stab wound. She can swim against impassible currents but struggles to do a pull up at several points in the movie. Her skill with a bow rivals every man with a machine gun that she encounters. Every side character in the movie only serves to move Lara forward in her mission. Most of the characters were completely flat and did not change from the beginning of the movie to the end. Lara was always adventurous and brave. The villain was always hellbent on destruction and gaining control of the disease.Then, script: The script was heinous. One of the lines was something like, ""the tomb isn't meant to keep us out, but to keep us in."" Several people in the theater laughed in response, but I doubt that was the intended reaction.The plot was stereotypical, boring, and we've all seen it before. Miss this movie and buy yourself a nice dinner. Trust me.",Tomb Raider
228,boscofl,"""I'll take two""",6,20 April 2021,"Based on the popular video game series (of which I have limited knowledge) Tomb Raider is an entertaining reboot of the early 2000s films starring Angelina Jolie as the venerable Lara Croft. While the Jolie films were delightfully cheesy and packed with over-the-top science fiction elements this edition strives to be more gritty and visceral. Alicia Vikander ably fills the boots of Lady Croft in what amounts to an origin story. The narrative progresses from the mean streets of London to Hong Kong and ultimately to some dangerous Skull Island wannabe hidden in the Pacific (or possibly Indian) Ocean. Young Miss Croft must rely on her wits and parental teachings to survive this adventure.The story opens with Lara Croft scrounging out an existence because inheriting her missing father's estate will require her to declare him legally dead. She soon discovers that her Dad's secret life was dedicated to finding the tomb of Himiko, the first queen of Japan and an evil sorceress, and prevent it from being discovered by the nefarious Trinity group. His final instruction for Lara was to burn his Himiko research but, as this would make for a short movie, she instead follows his clues in an effort to find out what happened to him. Naturally she immerses herself in all kinds of trouble and must do things Lara Croft is famous for.The one hiccup in the plot is why would you go searching for something better left undisturbed? Because someone worse wants to unleash evil, that's why! In hindsight if Lara simply burned her father's research and stayed home (as is suggested many times in the film) the tomb would never have been discovered. Of course where's the fun in that? There are enough twists to make the tomb raiding seem crucial but the film never truly overcomes this stumbling block. Another issue is the pacing; the film tends to bog down particularly in the final 40 minutes and would have benefited from tighter editing and a shorter run time. On the black side of the ledger are some pretty ingenious set pieces, particularly one involving a wrecked airplane, that dazzle although they make one wonder how much punishment a body can realistically take. Normally this wouldn't be an issue in an action film but, again, the slow pacing gives one time to ponder these things.Alicia Vikander is truly impressive as a woman of action. She is a natural in the physical sequences particularly in displaying her fantastic running form; she obviously spent countless hours training for the role. Miss Vikander also handles the quieter moments well to craft a winning, all around performance that anchors the film. The other standout is Walter Goggins who takes a surprisingly subdued route as the villain of the piece. The narrative initially endeavors to flesh out his character and make him appear sympathetic: he's a man who desperately wants to get home to his family but is trapped on the island until he completes his task. Alas, the script betrays him and he devolves into a gun wielding psycho after the promising introduction. Dominic West portrays Richard Croft in a competent, if unexciting, fashion while Daniel Wu serves as Lara's companion and ally when things get deadly. Kristen Scott Thomas has a couple of scenes as a parental figure for Lara who may not be all that she seems.In sum Tomb Raider is a pretty good entry in the action adventure category that strives for a gritty realism to go with the thrills. The script isn't particularly compelling and much of the story will likely alienate devotees of the video game series. The true danger in the tomb of Himiko is a bit of a twist and will likely surprise first time viewers. The movie even sets up a sequel that will likely have Lara Croft in her familiar guise as the two gun treasure hunter. Frankly this initial entry in the potential franchise is worthy of a sequel and one can only hope Miss Vikander can expand on her portrayal of the intrepid heroine in further adventures.",Tomb Raider
229,richarddillomes,The airplane was exhilarating and if someone makes a whole movie out of that I'm here for it.,7,7 October 2019,"With Hollywood running out of ideas to make money from, here's another reboot in the form of Tomb Raider which starred Angelina Jolie. It's easy to dismiss this as a poor man's version of the original and is therefore a waste of your time. And for the most part it is, mostly because the storyline is predictable (but in my opinion this was better written than Kong: Skull Island, see review for that in the coming days), but when you get past that you'll start enjoying the movie thereafter.While it was needed to meander around with her background story, it was refreshing to see her not living off of her dad's money and having struggled in life (albeit unnecessarily) which makes for her grittiness and bravery more authentic than a miscreant heiress with nothing better to do with her time and money. Alicia Vikander doesn't win you over instantly when you first lay eyes on her (especially after I read that Daisy Ridley and Emilia Clarke were also up for the role) but once you see her in action she'll have you convinced she's the right person for the role. She was acting even when screaming: not the sort where she's trying to show you she's strong but where she's showing you she's a woman but she'll take you on no matter what.When I watched the trailer and saw Daniel Wu I thought, here we go again with the casting of an Asian actor in the name of diversity. His storyline sucked but this is one of those that integrated diversity into the movie naturally. Kristin Scott Thomas is still as ineffable when I saw her in the first Mission Impossible movie 22 years ago.While there were numerous plot holes to contend with, the action scenes which we all came for more than makes up for it, especially the sequence with the airplane which was exhilarating and if someone makes a whole movie out of that I'm here for it. They could've also shortened her background story and prolonged the cave scene because they came up with a fresh take on the 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' theme.Overall takeaway, it might seem redundant especially if you've seen the Angelina movies but it is entertaining enough if you give it a try.",Tomb Raider

231,andrewmerritt-31652,Not the Tomb Raider I remember,6,8 January 2020,"Tomb Raider is based off of the classic video games and stars Alicia Vikander as the new Lara Croft after Angelina Jolie left. In this Tomb Raider adaptation Lara Croft gets a secret message from her dad believing him to be dead. She follows his research towards an island where she is captured and must escape the island. Now personally I enjoyed Angelina's performance as Lara Croft so hearing Alicia Vikander as the new Lara Croft I was skeptical, but she pulled it off. I played the Tomb Raider game and Alicia Vikander looks like her from the video game. The first twenty minutes of the movie kept me really interested and maybe there was a silver lining where movies based off of video games aren't awful. And until she reaches the island that's where things got a little slow. They had everything they needed from elements of the video game to a great performance, but it was lacking in script. Giving what Alicia Vikander was working with I think they could've added more to her character than just having it be your typical Indiana Jones movie. Another great performance is Walton Groggins as the villain. Walton Groggins is one of those actors where the movie can be really bad, but somehow he can pull it off and make the movie a little bit better. Which he is a good actor, I just think he needs to do a movie where he can get himself out there.

So this was never really a film anyone wanted in my opinion.That said while the production is competent, that acting okay, there is actually little resemblance between either lara in the movie and the games, or the tone of the games themselves. It feels like a low ball attempt at a massively popular game series, like most game adaptions. The lara character doesn't look the part, none of the side characters are present, and the main plot is a pale imitation of the games. Again, not that the games themselves where popular due to their plotting, but rather due to the survival, puzzle solving, and exploratory nature.I can honestly say I think the original movie was better.

It's not the most original storyline and the set pieces, while passable, are not great either in terms of invention or execution (this isn't an uber expensive action movie, despite the reported near 100 million dollar budget. That money doesn't translate onto the screen as it looks more along the lines of a movie on the scale of Deadpool, a mid tier 50-60 million dollar actioner).But I really liked the movie for what was, IS:It's an origin story for Lara, the Tomb Raider, and Lara Croft, her father's daughter. And the focus on establishing Lara Croft, her personal journey along with the adventure is why I enjoyed the movie. Well that and a fantastic performance by Alicia Vikander. She breathed life (levity, warmth, strength of character, and pathos) into Lara Croft. The writers did a great job of writing Lara, actually giving her a proper arc in terms of both her personal journey and the hero's journey. She felt like a real three dimensional human being, and never overly sexualized or over-powered. If you're at all a fan of Vikander and/or Lara, I really think you'll like this movie.Overall, If you feel like you might like too see a more character driven smaller scale action movie with a great lead then I think you'll really enjoy Tomb Raider.",Tomb Raider

I think people who are fans of the Tomb raider are actually fans of Jolie's portrayal of the character rather than the films. In this film, which is actually an origin story, you'll see Croft scared, crying and getting beat up but eventually rising above. For that Alicia Vikander was a really good choice. She is funny and timid at the start but till the end she will make you believe that she can pull this series off.

242,Gelaos,Videogame adaptation done right,7,18 September 2018,"Firstly, for all the haters, this movie is based on videogame just as those with Angelina Jolie were. ""Based on"" doesn't mean ""to strictly follow"". Yeah, it's budget movie. Yeah, it's full of cliché and predictable. So what? Basically all Marvel movies are full of cliché, shallow characters, predictability, stupid decisions, villains with almost no reasonable motivation. And yet, those movies are making big money and not many people hate them. Now why is that?Tomb Raider videogame series was rebooted for a second time in 2013 when the storytelling in videogames is strongly influenced by hollywood storytelling style. The game was more serious than the previous parts, and for the first time it showed Lara as a young, inexperienced, vulnerable girl. Well, this movie follows the same path.Lara is delightful and Alicia Vikander has performed her role perfectly. Both the action and the camera let you know that the movie has video game origin, Goggins is good antagonist, CGI feels cheaper (but not cheap), every aspect is well-crafted and everything holds togehter. Tomb Raider doesn't introduce anything new into the genre but I consider it the best adventure movie in its genre category since the 4th Indiana Jones.",Tomb Raider
243,AnnieLola,Indestructo-Girl Survives Anything!,6,7 April 2021,"I never played the game nor watched Angelina Jolie as Lara, so had no expectations. The visuals are amazing, and the idea of the lost tomb on the island intriguing. Also amazing is young Lara --who doesn't look remotely as though she'll turn into anything like A. Jolie-- getting put through the mill time and again without any resultant broken limbs or ribs, even a sprain. She does get a nasty gash, but doesn't seem to lose much blood. Impressive physical feats and stuntwork, but an overload of very brutal violence.Alicia certainly can act, and really excels at simulating extreme pain, which happens a lot. Having had some acquaintance with extreme pain, a little goes a long way with me-- too darned convincing!",Tomb Raider

This is an activity-adventure film based on the 2013 video game of the same name and is a reboot of the Tomb Raider film series. The film stars Alicia Vikander as Lara Croft, who embarks on a perilous journey to her father's last-known destination, hoping to solve the mystery of his disappearance. It also stars Dominic West, Walton Goggins, Daniel Wu, and Kristin Scott Thomas. Tomb Raider has grossed a worldwide total of $273.3 million, but will barely break even. It had mixed or average reviews. Audiences gave the film an average grade of B. This wasn't the greatest effort, a sub par film at best. The original was a touch better. I simply don't see where the budget went. The CGI was average throughout, to downright atrocious in the final action sequence. The pacing was slow in the beginning and the film was too long. It would be surprising if they break even in the end. This just had the feel of something straight to video, with a budget meant for a summer blockbuster.",Tomb Raider

I did enjoy it, but it didn't keep me glued to the screen.As you might expect with a videogame adaptation, yes, in some places it felt like you were watching someone play an actual videogame. The main character is fun and spunky. Her father is what people of Oxford and equal places would want to be but can never be due to their lack of actual aspirations other than a name.It's very run of the mill.And they messed up in the end: they make Lara do something with her axe that considering the context wasn't believable and wouldn't come up in a character's mind. Even the dumbest of characters wouldn't do that with the axe and she's supposed to be wicked smart.

First and foremost Alicia Vikander did more than play Lara Croft, she was Lara Croft. The chemistry between all the cast members was tremendous, everything just seemed to click from beginning to end. I loved the attention to detail, the old charts, pictures and travel details. The scenes at the beginning in London really laid out the characters well, we get a good glimpse at Lara and her character. Everyone seems to fit the part perfectly. The concept of an evil entity perverting humanity and destroying nations is nothing to be laughed at, considering some of the gangsters running things on planet earth these days. We need to be reminded that evil exists, but there is always someone somewhere that has the guts to take it on and win!

Otherwise this is just good old fashioned entertainment.The story is predictable, but then again it isn't like you didn't know what was going to happen. If you have ever played the games you knew, frankly to deviate too far would have probably made it different enough that people would be complaining about that as well.I thought the entire thing made it what it was/is supposed to be, an action adventure with some minor storyline injections to justify the circumstance. Besides, who watches a movie that exists only for the fact that a game franchise was successful and expects that much more? Doom being the best equivalent in my mind and that movie never tried to paint the picture beyond only what the gamers would have been aware of, at least this one could be viewed by someone who never played the game and enjoyed for what it is!Finally I would like to state that the folks that criticised the special effects and cgi need to take a 'who cares' pill! It wasn't dreadful, it was relevant and the scene with the aircraft over the waterfall was actually pretty impressive, at least I thought it was.Synopsis: watch this for the entertainment value and don't compare it to the game.

Alicia Vikander is miscast as Lara Croft, Angelina Jolie's Lara Croft was smart, brave and more butt-kicker badass; Vikander acting is bland (She's not a good actress) and her Croft is not brave enough and not smart enough.

yes , it has its classic action movie cliches and some cheap plot twists but as you look over that you will see that the plot is decent and the actors are great .The environment is made for the big screen and there are some nice shots and views.

255,rustonreviews,New blood.,7,13 April 2018,"Videogame movies are known to be disappointments to fans. Most recently, the 2016 Michael Fassbender Assassins Creed film failed with both critics and fans of the highly acclaimed videogame series, seemingly cementing the opinion that films based off popular games never, ever work. My knowledge of the Tomb Raider universe is practically non-existent. I've never played the videogames, and I remember very little of the original Angelina Jolie film from 2001. It's sequel, The Circle of Life (2003), skipped my radar entirely, but the recent discovery of a GIF featuring Jolie as Croft punching a shark in the face brought much amusement. Seemingly ditching the cheese factor of the originals, this 2018 reboot plays things much straighter, with Alicia Vikander taking over the iconic role in a story that takes influence from the recently rebooted PS4 videogame series.Ever since the disappearance of her father, Lara Croft has been in denial about his death. Despite being told over and over that he's gone and never coming back, Croft still believes deep down that he is alive out there somewhere. Discovering his extensive research on the tomb of Queen Himiko, she ventures out to an island off the coast of Japan in the hopes of reuniting with him. But getting to the island itself proves to be dangerous enough, quickly resulting in Croft being stranded on the island and forced to embark on an expedition under the authority of a ruthless organisation.Sometimes, it helps not having a vast knowledge of the original source material, as I got to watch Tomb Raider with eyes that couldn't possibly draw endless comparisons to the games whilst picking apart all the things the film may or may not have done differently. Because of this, I was able to enjoy it perfectly for what it was: a fun action/adventure flick. 
Taking over a role as iconic as this one from Angelina Jolie must have been a weighty task, but Vikander pulls it off with ease, almost as if she was born to inhabit the character. Vikander is a fantastic Croft, but what this film wisely chooses to do is explore the origins of the character, slowly working up to presenting us with the Croft that's not to be reckoned with. Physically, Croft goes through the ringer here. Whether it's struggling to navigate through vicious waters or attempting to escape from within the ruined interior of an old airplane perched atop various rocks on the edge of a waterfall, the danger never seems to let up. Her relationship with her father thankfully gives the film it's emotional backbone, providing us with a reason to care for her throughout the adventure. As for the action sequences, they are pure videogame joy and frequently buzz with dynamic excitement. Despite Vikander's likability in the role and the great visuals, the villain of the film (played by Walter Goggins) is very one dimensional and his evil nature and motivations are never really developed. In the end, he's there to be the threatening antagonist for Croft to face off against, nothing more, but Goggins does it adequately enough regardless. 
Tomb Raider shows promise to be the start of an enjoyable franchise. Although most films scatter in hints and set ups for future instalments, this film thankfully saves all that until the very end. It's clear that the focus here was to make a fun and entertaining film first, with sights set on sequels clearly saved as a last-minute thought. As a result, the film works completely as a stand-alone adventure. Fast paced, full of thrilling action with a wonderful leading lady in Vikander, Tomb Raider is a fun ride from start to finish.",Tomb Raider
256,BBogus,"Not Tomb Raider, B Action movie about little girl with daddy issues.",3,29 May 2018,Why use the title of a video game when it is nothing like it?

257,heatsink98,Generic adventure,3,10 August 2019,"The film is a fairly flat and by-the-numbers adventure in the jungle that includes the bad guy, his minions, a missing father, and Lara Croft. There's a tomb that nobody should open, but hey, bad guys being bad guys, why not open it anyway?There's also a particular fight scene that should win an award for the dumbest fight scripting ever. The scene involves Lara racing to jump ahead of the generic bad guy and land on a rickety ladder over a pit. Instead of running to the opposite side of the pit and kicking the ladder over, Lara decides to fight backward to the side of the pit she started on, duke it out with the bad guy, then kick the ladder over to seemingly trap everyone inside the tomb (that nobody should open but did anyway).

Vikander is a very talented actor who deserves a far better script than the one offered to her. I was excited by the prospect of seeing her version of Lara Croft but was a bit disappointed. This film has its moments but they are far too few to sustain its worth. It's an action film with too little substance and improbable events to actually care about the heroine and her companion.

I walked into this movie with no hope as movies like Prince of persia and assassin's Creed have let me down in the past. But surprisingly this movie was really good. Alicia vikander was great as Lara Croft and waaay better than Angelina Jolie. This movie had a lot of tension and kept me at the edge of my seat. The phasing was fast and didn't lag , it has a lot of cliches from all the adventure movies you've seen over the years but this ones special for being a video game adaptation. I liked the supporting characters as well and liked how they did some quick edits to explain things.The music in this movie was really good especially during the slo mo jump scenes. And that's pretty much that there is . In the end it's a ray of hope for video game adaptations , it has great action , good characters , a setup of its franchise and a pair of handguns.",Tomb Raider
260,verminhater,A film of two halves,6,23 June 2018,"This film is in two differing halves. There's the first part before Lara gets to the island and what comes after differs completely. The film starts off very well and has all the hallmarks of being a quality movie, telling Lara's initial story. From the halfway point though it goes downhill with a complete cliche fest complete with one dimensional baddies and every trapdoor imaginable in a tomb. You can spot the change as though written by two different writers right at the time Lara finds a Japanese sailor in a Japanese port who just happens to speak perfect English as per someone who's lived all their lives in the USA. It's just not credible. 
The good news is this Lara is at least vulnerable. Gone is the ""get out of any situation"" Lara of Angelina Jolie and in comes Alicia Vikander's much more human Lara. A very welcome change.",Tomb Raider
261,FabledGentleman,Recycled Hollywood crap,3,30 May 2018,"Well, this is one of those films that just don't have anything going for it no matter how you look at it. Except for Vikander, which tries her very best to hold this landfill of a movie together with everything she got.This movie is so predictable, i knew exactly what would happen at every turn, the dialogue is uninspired and flat, the story is absolutely without any emotional impact, but they try to, they really tried to make it this way, and then it's left to the actors and the director to make sure those emotions are portrayed correctly and have enough time to grow into something touches the audience, but, it does not. It's like it has copy paste dialogue from dozens of B movies, and a rushed and totally illogical story. When you have these two combined, any emotional impact you try to create, will not result in anything less than failure.It's so weird that such a great actress like Vikander chose to star in this film, i have no idea what she saw in this script. Because this movie can not strengthen her career one bit, this can only damage it. She is a very talented, young and beautiful actress that quite quickly has proven herself to be one of the special ones, an actress that can succeed really big if she chooses her projects carefully. And therefore it's mindbogglingly weird that she decided to do this, her salary must have been exceptional.Well there won't be a Tomb Raider 2 movie this time, that i can promise you, at least not with Alicia, if she chooses to make a sequel to this she is quite frankly mad.Tomb Raider is one of those game franchises that should be easy to make into a good movie, it has everything going for it, and i love the games, at least the game from 2012 that this movie loosely is based upon. I think Lara Croft is a very interesting character, but for some weird reason, no one seem to be able to write her a compelling story, it's always going to be cliche after cliche.Why don't they try and make her more fun? And why is it so hard to make her a movie that resembles Indiana Jones? They are in many ways the same character, just opposite sex. But even Indiana Jones haven't had a decent movie since 1989, so i guess it's just one of those things.But even so, if it is only one of those things, they should just let movie scripts like these go into the trash bin. Steven Spielberg stated a couple of times that when he saw Laurence of Arabia in the cinema, he almost gave up becoming a director because that movie could not be topped, i guess we can all be glad he still became one because he has made some really great movies. But Tomb Raider on the other hand is one of those movies that are so mediocre and bad in everything it tries to accomplish, i want to become a movie director just to save Hollywood from themselves.But in midst of all the poop there are some good things about this film. Some scenes are actually quite intense and entertaining to watch, and Vikander is indeed playing the part quite well, except it feels oddly weird to play like this in a movie with zero emotional impact, and there is also some nice cgi in there, but nothing revolutionary.Meh, well it's what i expected.

Add to that really basic and brainless dialogue and you have yourself a tacky transparent grab at corporate cash, which should flop. I really hope they don't make a sequel.Vikander is also woefully miscast. She is nowhere near as interesting or exciting as Jolie (or even the game avatar). To be completely frank, she is too small, weak and dull to be convincing. Lara Croft is supposed to be a strong, fun and camp character, but Vikander's performance is whiny, annoying and rather boring. Give it a miss and just play the game instead.

All I hear and see is her MIRACULOUSLY learning quick to be a bad-donkey and looking like a ""doormat"" at the same time. Besides that, I have played the video games and would expect Lara Croft to die and respawn back to life instead of gracefully living throughout the film without dying. If she respawned back to life, then I would think this would be more video game-oriented. But, no. This film is a desperate attempt to make money. I know fully well that Alicia some how found a way to get into the mainstream spotlight, but I think she can do much more than associate with people that only care about money and playing it safe with banal shows.",Tomb Raider

She should consider herself very lucky to be cast in anything going forward. No doubt this snoozefest will get a sequel as they always do now in this world where mediocrity reigns supreme. The strange side effect of all the garbage made today is it makes us realise that the movies we thought were terrible 15 years ago are actually brilliant in comparison. Im off to watch the Jolie version which was at least fun and didn't insult the viewer by pretending to be a serious action movie. 4 stars as I'm not one of these idiots who gives 1 stars to a movie they don't like thus subverting the review system.

I understand from the plot point of view why her dad was found alive, but as a story aspect, I thought it took away from the near soldier like qualities shown in the original Tomb Raider movies. That character was very similar to a Bruce Wayne type. Money is no object, living in a palace, has two faithful essentially family members who have the tech skills or the street smarts to assist the amazingly physical combatant as well as near genius IQ warrior out to save humanity from those who would seek power for evil purposes.

I was excited to see Lara Croft redone, having loved Tomb Raider games and Indiana Jones films, and playing those games always made me believe it would be great to see a live action Lara Croft go adventuring Indiana Jones style, but for some reason film producers just can't seem to hit the mark. The choice of Alicia Vikander thrilled me to no end, as I have long been intrigued by this lovely actress based on her previous performances, but, through no fault of her own her character lacks any significant depth, and the film's narrative is forced and clunky, seemingly devoid of enthusiasm, novelty or imagination. All we see is extremely standard adventure garbage mechanisms - the bike chase, the silly puzzle clues, the shipwreck, the escape, etc etc, it's all so *YAWN*. Sadly it proves yet another cash-grab based off a video game, this time from Square Enix. It's amazing, one of the best film action film sequences I have seen involving high-tech tactical combat was Ubisoft's own Ghost Recon: Alpha, which can be seen on youtube, and yet their feature film attempts in Prince of Persia and Assassin's Creed feel more like fan films than actual professional productions, particularly in the fact that even were they included as part of the game they would still feel hollow. Square Enix's Tomb Raider franchise is just as bad. So far the only one worth a damn was the original Hitman, and I suppose Max Payne was the next least terroble.

The game this movie is based off of is my favorite game of all of them. Having said that I thought they could have tried a bit harder to adapt the game a bit more.
I loved everything on the island for the most part. The drama with her father brought me back to the 2003 Tomb Raider film. I almost wish they had left it out.
The parts of her not on the island was a bit bizarre. Having sworn off her fortune and taken up as a bicycle delivery person? There was the big fat Greek wedding scene. The million dollar baby scene of her getting her butt kicked. With the cherry on top was the pointless bike race ending with her getting hit by a car. What?!
Things I did love were the sequences taken right out of the game. The boat scene, airplane scene, and the puzzles with the tomb. Alicia did the best she could. You can tell she threw herself into the role and I give her props for it. I kind of wish they hadn't ended it with a cliffhanger hanger though.

It's not perfect, at the beginning it has a pretty funny & silly plot but after the first act it rises surprisingly. The best film after Indiana Jones (it's not a comedy like the other movies of this genre, this one is really dark & serious). Photography & Landscape are beautiful.

278,josephrygaard,Before Watching: Tomb Raider (2018),7,16 July 2019,"""Tomb Raider"" (2018) is your average Friday-night, popcorn-action movie. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Tomb Raider, despite its casual and almost-cheesy approach, has a few spikes of violence that are quite mature. People are shot and dies of traps in one way or another, to give a few examples. Younger viewers can and most likely will find those scenes unsettling. In the same tone, the second half of the movie use visual and audio jump scares a few times.There is a risk that some viewers due to this movie's low rating will lower their estimations. There are indeed a few things which feel questionable and inconsistent, and some consequences pass by a little too easy, but those things can be overlooked and doesn't detract a whole lot from the main story. On the other hand, don't expect too much either. Treating this as an average action movie in the same style as Indiana Jones (although perhaps less charismatic) is the correct approach, and it will reward you for those expectations.My personal grade: a dangling 7/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews.",Tomb Raider
279,Osmiumos,Watch Alice run... and grunt,1,24 September 2021,"That's what the title for this film should be: ""watch Alice run and grunt and swim"".Maybe that's enough for IMDB viewers rating this between 6 and 10 (really?).Extended scenes of characters running through the jungle being chased... running along wharf/boats being chased... surviving a capsized boat, lots of struggling underwater and finally up for air before making it to shore...
Oops, now she's fallen in a river... more underwater ""action""... will she survive... oooh the suspense.This isn't story telling. It's expensive, mindless filler and it is BORING.This movie is unbearable. I gave up.",Tomb Raider
280,MichaelNontonMulu,A nice reboot of the iconic video game character's movie,8,8 March 2018,"At first when I found out about the reboot of this iconic video game character movie, I admit that I had my doubts when they cast Alicia Vikander to play Lara Croft. My doubt was due to the her prior experience of mostly having dramatic roles rather than action role. It would really require a great physical attributes in order to play this heroine who was famous for her agility and ability to run and jump through a whole lot of dangerous places like in the video game. But it turned out my doubt was completely unwarranted. Alicia Vikander truly deserves the praise for being a new action star and she was really great in playing this role. There were soo many action sequences that required her to do all those stuff and what surprised and amazed me was the fact that she did all of her stunts. This movie's main attraction was definitely all those wonderful action sequence. The plot/story line might not have been appealing to the movie critics as I also found it a bit weak. But that was not the point anyway. When we go to see Tomb Raider, the first thing that comes to people's mind would be lots of actions. The final third of the movie did not disappoint at all. Though I personally felt that the first half was not full of those. But whenever there were actions involved, they were always suspenseful and intense (my most favorite part would be when Lara was going through the jungle and waterfall until finally went to the ground). In here the movie focused on Lara Croft's early days. Which means the movie was more of an origin story of Lara Croft. This was a nice different approach by the film makers. It was also rather a surprise that the movie was not directed by Hollywood's more well known action director. The director was Roar Uthaug, a Norwegian film maker whose prior experience were directing Norwegian films. But I personally think he did wonderful job on the action sequences.As for other aspects like the sound effects, it was definitely great. The musical effect though not too good to my opinion (sometimes there was too much volume in certain scene which I think was to give more dramatic effect but felt unnecessary to my opinion). The special effects were good, and the CGI was done neatly & nicely. There were also few dramatic moments where my wife was also affected a bit. Oh there was also a brief fun appearance from Nick Frost. The other supporting characters in the movie that stood out was obviously Walter Goggins (as usual truly nailed it as a villain). The rest were OK, but sadly Daniel Wu's character was not really that great in here (not clear on whether he was supposed to be Lara's sidekick or what). The movie did not have middle or post end-credit scene, so you can relief yourself to the restroom if you have been holding off during the almost 2 hours duration of the movie. Overall, this movie was a nice reboot of Lara Croft. Do not overthink the plot or the sometimes not really logical part like how Lara was so strong & very good in doing all those stunts despite not having the proper training. Go to this movie to be entertained by the amazing action sequence (even if Lara seemed to be always very lucky like what my wife said). If you enjoy this kind of movie or if you are a fan of Tomb Raider games, then I think it would be satisfying. But if you want to see a lot of the tomb raiding scenes like in the previous Tomb Raiders movies, or if you are looking for the Indiana Jones quality, then this might not be too fulfilling. for my complete review pls have a look at michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id",Tomb Raider

Honestly, I did not want to see this film, but I gave it a chance and it is actually pretty good! I loved the action, the adventure, and the mystery. Also, Alicia Vikander killed it as Lara Croft and put on a great performance. The action sequences keep your spine tingling and you get a sense of adventurous thrill.

283,andershenningsen,Not a Tomb Raider movie,3,1 October 2018,There is nothing more to say than see the old ones with Angelina Jolie... because this one is disappointing at all levels.,Tomb Raider
284,jordanthomas_2009-346-914758,An okay remake,6,12 June 2018,"It's an origin story inspired by the 2013 game. However some of the action set pieces just copy and paste the memorable levels from that game. Alicia Vickander is good in the role of Lara Croft, she portrays her as a more grounded and conflicted person. The supporting characters are one-dimensional and merely just there for exposition. Walton Goggins plays the un-intimidating baddie who doesn't do much but give monologues. Thankfully, he's only in it for about 20 minutes.The film as a whole feels less dumb than the Angelina Jolie film, but that's not so say it hasn't got dumb moments. Some of action scenes are good but most of them feel choppy and watered down. There is no graphic injury detail like in the 2013 game and when she shoots her arrows the camera just cuts away. It's predictable and there is one twist that is so poorly executed you'll see it coming a mile away. It's a forgettable film with a middle section that is a bit bland. If there is anything good to take away from Tomb Raider it's Alicia Vikanders dedication to the role and the final puzzle sequence which is quite entertaining. If they was to ever make a sequel they should consider hiring better writers.",Tomb Raider
285,CobertNeede,They finally got it right,7,12 April 2018,"Of all the video game adaptations that took place through the decade, only Warcraft (2016) stood out. But Warcraft too had slight problems, but still a good, solid film. It's a shame critics bashed it. Tomb Raider is the one video game adaptation that they finally did right. Alicia Vikander shines as Lara and protrudes the kind of attitude that many previous adaptation lacked. Jolie's Lara was fine, but Vikander tops it. Daniel Wu , Walter Goggins, Dominic West all produced a fine and solid performance with a pretty great villainous performance from Walter Goggins. As much as Tomb Raider is based on the 2013 Video Game, it does not stretch thin into the Game's plot. When the video game produces a twist of character through the end, the film produces a well written, pretty eerie revelation. The 2013 Game contains supernatural elements, which i noticed was removed from the adaptation. Of all the changes that they deem bad, this one ain't it. The scientific revelation was one of the best part in the whole movie. With some great music from Junkie XL, Tomb Raider is now officially the best video game adaptation the world has witnessed.If you have played the 2013 Game, and even if you haven't there isn't a major revelation around in this movie. Himiko , Mathias, the Devil's Sea, The Trinity all are featured, but introduced and developed in a different way. The final 6 minutes are pure fan service to the 2003 Jolie's Croft. Not gonna spoil it for you, but if anything deserves a sequel, it's Tomb Raider.",Tomb Raider
286,iamianiman,Still not manage to save the video game movie genre,4,10 March 2018,"Video game movies have a history of being bad. Some of which are mediocre (""Mortal Kombat"", ""Resident Evil"") while others are just plain awful (""Postal""). It is as if video game movies are doomed to fail even when it has a good director on board, like Duncan Jones for ""Warcraft"". Nevertheless, Hollywood still has not given up on its mission to wow gamers and everyday audiences with their latest video game movie, ""Tomb Raider"".""Tomb Raider"" is a reboot of the previous ""Tomb Raider"" movies which starred Angelina Jolie. In this reboot, Alicia Vikander takes her place as the adrenaline junkie, Lara Croft, who is on a quest to search for her father after being lost for seven years without a single trace. She eventually finds a lead to her father's whereabouts and stumbles upon an organisation who is after the tomb of Himiko in the island of Yamatai, a Japanese legend that could cause destruction to the world.If you were hoping for ""Tomb Raider"" to be the triumphant success among the 'video game movie curse', well, keep on hoping. Although ""Tomb Raider"" takes its cues from the critically acclaimed 2013 video game of the same name, the movie fails to show the elements of adventure and puzzle-solving from that game for the big screen.The action-adventure aspect lacks in ""Tomb Raider"" due to its focus on Lara's origin story that is almost similar to the last two movies, which makes it pointless to rehash. Even if it is a reboot, the movie did not have to reintroduce the character all over again because that has already been done before a couple of years ago. Plus, I am pretty sure everybody, gamer or not, knows who Lara is.Puzzle-solving is a huge element that the movie misses out on. Instead of bringing the audience along to solve the puzzles together, Lara solves the puzzles herself without pointing out any clues leading to it. This leaves the audience confused and feeling uninvolved in her adventures. The montage of her reading (more like skimming) her father's notebook which should have been an important part of the movie, is just breezed through without mentioning any vital information regarding her quest to Yamatai.When making a movie based on an iconic character such as Lara Croft, the actress portraying her must be able to deliver her characteristics and bring the fictional character to life. Luckily, Alicia Vikander managed to do it just right. Although more petite than expected, she effortlessly presented her take on Lara while staying true to the source material. She is charming when she needs to slither her way out of an awkward situation and she is tough when she needs to fight off the bad guys.The other cast were functional as their characters. Walton Goggins who plays the villain Mathias Vogel is the most menacing of all compared to other villains who were in the two previous ""Tomb Raider"" movies. Chinese superstar Daniel Wu is Lara's sidekick in the movie who travels to Yamatai with her. The bond between two is shown when they always help each other out no matter how dangerous the situation gets.So, after watching the movie, the most crucial question would be: Is the video game movie genre saved? Not quite, but ""Tomb Raider"" is at least interesting enough to keep the audiences excited for a sequel which was hinted at the end of this movie. For now though, we are just going to have to sit through her origin story and wait for what is next for this beloved character.",Tomb Raider

292,jan-hranac,Two stars for trying,2,12 June 2018,"I have to admit, I was sorely tempted to give this only one star. But then I couldn't do it. This flick is trying, really trying. OK, let's delve into this.I guess we should start with the game. Or, to be more specific, with the first installment of the reboot. And also it's sequel. Movies made from games are usually bad. The thing is, the game (Tomb Raider 2013) is actually a better film than this. Really. Just just watch a cinematic style cut gameplay of the game on youtube and you'll get better experience than this. And for free! Compared to this, even the Doom movie did a better job and that says something. Moreover, the Doom movie was utterly self-contained. Tomb Raider makes sense only in context of the game, despite the fact that it diverts from the game quite a lot.The game had much better pacing in regards to turning Lara from a naive PHD to a survivor. The movie is rather inconsistent in this. On one hand, they are trying to avoid being unrealistic. At the same time, they unrealistically avoided early stages of Lara's development. Why? I suspect some lefty reasons here. A women in a Hollywood movie simply can't be portrayed as weak no matter what. The irony is, the game was actually a perfect feminist title. And yet, it was the feminists who slandered it the most. Why? Because it contained actual character development. There was a long road between a Lara that was queasy about killing a deer for food and a Lara that slaughtered and army of undead samurai in head to head combat. In the end, the movie is merely ""politically correct"". Lara's strength seems utterly artificial and a far cry from the naturalness of the original.Another thing is stealing from source material that's supposed to be further along the way. The ""Alice in Wonderland"" (2010) did it and because if it, the sequal (2016) sucked because there was nothing left. Tomb Raider has a similar problem. Trinity wasn't supposed to be introduced until the sequel. The same goes for Anna's duplicity. Lara wasn't supposed to declare war on Trinity until next time. Hell, Lara wasn't even supposed to get anywhere near her father's work until next time - the Himiko project was her baby. No, I'm not saying that the movie was supposed to copy the game exactly (something which the movie actually did try in details). If the movie did the things it's own way, I would be perfectly happy. It's all a matter of pacing and rationing the information you give to the audience.Since I mentioned the differences between the game and the movie, I believe I should complete the thought. The movie does try to mimic the game in a lot of details. Items (the ice-pick), scenes, situations (the bomber plane), and such. Alas, they do seem rather artificial. The bomber scene had no preliminary background (Japanese bunkers) - it was simply cut from the game. In contrast, the movie diverged in all bid, important things. This creates quite a schizophrenia. Moreover, these details which worked so well in a game not always translate well to live-action movies.The last thing I'm going to mention is magic. The Tomb Raider games weren't afraid if magic. Himiko was magic. So was the other thing that Lara's father (and Trinity) was actually after. The beauty was in the fact that the games managed to bring the element of magic and supernaturalness into the mix quite well. As in, better than in Harry Potter series. In the opposite, the movie was making it's best to avoid any kind of magic altogether - even at the cost of looking like a cheap copy of Resident Evil movies.All in all, I guess that that this franchise has dug a grave for itself. While the game franchise is going to go on and make a successful trilogy which is going to sell well as a pack on Steam, the movies will bury themselves with the part two. But, we are quite used to that in movie business, right? It's always about money.Also, I should mention that I don't own any of the games. A friend of mine let me try out the first one and I watched the second one on YT.",Tomb Raider
293,ryanbartlett-870-746486,Surprising! But still poor,5,5 July 2018,"A surprising adaptation of a previously poor movie. Now this is a film that won't get you hopping out of your seat, but it is one that shows some promise. Taking the previously minor success of Tomb Raider staring Angelina Jolie and replacing her with Alicia Vikander with a real focus on making her less ""sexy"" and more action star, and they balanced this nicely. I mean it is still Hollywood so the female has to be sexy, but this time they covered her in dirt, sweat, and blood. 
 During Tomb Raider, it brought me back to Indiana Jones, which is a great comparison if it lives up to the name. However, it unfortunately couldn't. What made Indiana Jones such a success was the personality of Harrison Ford and the light-hearted theme throughout the movies. They don't really take themselves seriously, and in the end the audience really doesn't care what they are ""searching for"" they just want to have a good time while its happening. Look at Temple of Doom for goodness sake, that movie involved monkey brains, and human sacrifice, and strange rituals, but it was still made in a way that audiences can look past this. Tomb Raider took itself way to seriously. They really wanted you to believe in this evil woman who died somewhere off the coast of Japan. Including some very similar alludes to Indiana jones movies, but none of the payoff. More of a fear factor movie and not an enjoyable adventure.",Tomb Raider
294,maindraaritomo,Not as video game at all,6,20 March 2018,"It is very trending, no superheroes that super. No video game characters that not bleeding or hurt when they are put in big screen. So is this new Tomb Raider. Yet, it is different era. Same name but no similarity with super Jolie's Lara Croft.Everything here is as expected, desperate girl who struggle to survive. That is all. Easy plot. Predicted ending. How tough the director to recreate it, too bad, I believe many scenes had been deleted which is important to reintroduce new Lara Croft. For example, how come it is so easy for Lara Croft tracking back to camp while getting out and off it almost killed her on every route she took?",Tomb Raider
295,regula1,"Video Game Movie Curse Not Broken Yet, But Cracks Are Beginning To Form",7,16 March 2018,"This is the one... this is the movie that will break the curse of all video game movies being terrible. So it has been said with every new video game film for the past decade or so. The last one that was supposed to be ""The One"" was Assassin's Creed, and it flopped badly.This film? Well, I don't think it quite breaks the curse, but it shows there is light at the end of the tunnel.This is, of course, a reboot/prequel to the Lara Croft: Tomb Raider films starring Angelina Jolie, themselves based on the 90s console games. It was said when the games first came out, and it holds true in this film as well: Lara Croft is basically Indiana Jones.That's not necessarily a bad thing. After all, both Indy and Lara have a certain amount of charm in their personalities, as well as fulfilling arcs in their first outings (no pun intended for Indy there). In the case of Indy, his arc was going from a cocky and smarmy archaeologist who learns to respect what is beyond him. In Lara's case, we see her struggling to deal with the disappearance of her father seven years earlier. She is seen as a woman trying to make an existence as far away as possible from the legacy of her name, for in order to embrace her legacy would mean declaring her father dead, so she lives in denial. However, she finds clues that lead to a message from her father that lead her to an island full of danger, both from the past and the present.First the positives. This film actually has some fun elements to it, but the movie doesn't really hang a light on them in order to get a laugh and move on. The fun and humor feels organic and in service to the story itself, which is full of action and danger.The action scenes in the beginning feel somewhat contrived, but are more at home once Lara reaches the island. The trailer shot of Lara leaping across the wing of a disintegrating plane wreck on a river is one of the more thrilling. Also, our film's hero Lara does not seem invincible. She often gets bashed around significantly, and her injuries play into the film as it goes, much like John Wick and how his injuries play into the action later on.However, that last point leads into some of the flaws with the film. While Lara does show strength in overcoming injuries at times, at other times she barely bats an eye as bullets whiz by or tunnels are disintegrating around her. This back and forth between realism and video game-ness breaks the illusion and can hamper the tension in certain scenes.The villain too, feels underdeveloped, which is often the case in these films, but mystery is built around a hidden backer of the villain's actions who, once their identity is revealed, left me thinking ""Ooookayy..."" It really didn't feel earned by the build-up.Finally, while Alicia Vikander's Lara Croft does grow on you eventually, she spends the majority of the movie in either one of two expressions: screaming and grunting in pain or blank stare. Even in emotional scenes, would it have killed her to muster up a tear or two? It felt like she lacked range, and the early parts of the movie suffer for it.Overall, though, despite these flaws, I would say definitely go see this film in theaters. Don't make this film a flop too, because it shows genuine potential for video game movies to become better than they have been, and this progress should be encouraged.Let's hope Rampage doesn't go the other direction.",Tomb Raider
296,kythia,Great actress entombed in a terrible script,3,22 February 2019,"Tomb Raider starts out really great. A bit of mythic suspense, then some light-hearted action with Lara and her friends. Alicia Vikander plays a believable rebel daughter who spurns daddy's riches, because he left her as a child. The movie makes a great effort to show how Lara learns to fight, shoot a bow, and so on, up to the point of it becoming a bit silly.But then she gets a message from the past and everything changes. The movie slows down to a crawl and desperatly tries to bring scenes from the videogame into the film, no matter if they make sense at that point or not. All that matters are game scenes that can be used in a movie trailer.When she eventually raids a tomb with an army of guys keeping her company (which feels ridiculous compared to the games btw), the story is already stuck in some contradictory supernatural story that nobody can follow anymore. It all ends in a giant mess of good ideas, terrible executions, and the occasional B-movie jump scare.I feel sorry for Alicia Vikander. She deserves better than this.",Tomb Raider
297,milleymeister,BKA,5,30 December 2020,"I couldn't get past 15 minutes of the Angelina Jolie Lara Croft movie. I think it started with a ridiculous martial arts chase or something. Ho Hum. It was so fake and unbelievable with no charm or humour.Having recently watched the Indiana Jones movies, I thought I would try this one out. Indiana Jones works, I think, due to several facets:
1) it borrows from Tintin for the exotic scenes and path around the world
2) It has a familiar villain (the Nazis) but isn't afraid to make them cartoonish as they would be in the 30s in a Tintin like book.In fact it stays true to its 30s adventure story look and feel. It also adds in some mythical-religious quests.
3) it adds humour such as the father-son dynamic, the bickering with the female lead, snakes and rats phobias, etc. In that way it doesn't take itself so seriously.Compare that to these Lara Croft movies where they hire Angelina Jolie or this young actress into a role. Then they have to turn it into a martial arts so called adventure movie. Yes I know it is from a video game but at some point it has to become a good movie. Someone who was suited as an adventurer who also must fight with all weapons and their body, is going to have a background of either a gymnast, acrobat or stunt woman. They are muscular and fit. Not skinny with big boobs (why? because they will have low body fat and likely stunted growth from the training regime through puberty).There was no attempt at the story really, no attempt at humour or not taking itself so seriously. No real attempt at an exotic mood. They could have been fighting King Kong on that island. Or gun/drug runners or anything else modern. Compare it with the awe in which Indiana Jones and Brody discuss the Holy Grail. The music, everything sets the stage in that movie and you feel the awe.But look at the comments here: actress's boobs weren't big enough, not enough skin, CGI sucked, etc. People just want their soft porn. The right eye candy. Why even bother with the semi attempt at an interesting adventure story? Don't call it that, just call it a ""boobs kicking ass"" movie. I'll give you three guesses who the boobs are.",Tomb Raider
298,TheJediWay9,"Pure Escapist, Entertaining, Popcorn Fun. Nothing More, Nothing Less",8,15 March 2018,"""Tomb Raider,"" the 2018 edition is a reboot of the TOMB RAIDER film series and this time Alicia Vikander steps into the role of Lara Croft as Lara travels to the island of Yamatai to follow her father's work while coming face to face with an organization named Trinity and its leader Mathias (Walton Goggins), who coerces Lara into helping him locate the tomb of Himiko. Now it's safe to say these video game adaptations don't go to well. We all know the track record, however I do like a few. The two previous TOMB RAIDER films with Angelina Jolie are huge guilty pleasures, The PRINCE OF PERSIA movie happens to be what i feel is a competent attempt at making a successful video game adaptation, and from a distance there are parts of ASSASSIN'S CREED that I admire. TOMB RAIDER is fun, entertaining, and one of the better video game movie adaptations we have. First of all, it all starts with Alicia Vikander. She does a great job as Lara and to me she is Lara. She embodies what Lara Croft in the reboot video game series is. She's vulnerable, young, and acting out of necessity. There is an attempt as well to actually give some development to Lara, something video game movies tend to breeze over. Though this may make the first half hour of the film feel a bit slow and choppy at times, it is necessary in that we get to know who Lara Croft is. the other characters however, are not all that developed, especially the villain Mathias, who is only in about two scenes in the movie.The action is fun, though it is a bit okay with the sky cam. There is enough to see though and understand what is going while the camera is shaking. My negatives are the final act was a ripoff of Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. Seriously, it's the exact same thing, as well as the final scene of the movie being in there for nothing more than fan service. Overall I am going to give TOMB RAIDER a B.",Tomb Raider

I found it better than the Jolie Tomb Raider, although I enjoyed that one as well. This is more grounded, and in no way campy. It is also more of an origin story, and updated which is where the gamers also hate it as well.

Reminded me a bit of the Dorky Supergirl series on TV. Gave her too much scared girl and not enough Croft. I imagine there are going to be more of these movies now the way this one ended. I sure hope they toughen her up more in the future, otherwise it's going to be hard to me to get into this adventure again. This was way too tame a Lara for me. This needs some darkness and some mean in it, and less 'family-kid' like. Unless of course they are going to put it on the Lifetime Channel. Was expecting a bit more but I got a bit less.",Tomb Raider
303,Chris_Ego,I wonder why it did so well at the box office,3,25 August 2021,"I was super excited to see ""Tomb Raider"" (2018) on Netflix, since I missed it back then when it was released to theaters. Sadly I was disappointed from the beginning of the movie. Lara is presented as an immature girl, who works for food delivery to earn some bucks. This doesn't fit the narrative and I don't know why they had to invent all this ridiculous backstory that fills a good third of the film.As the story unfolds Lara is being pushed into extreme challenges and the death bar rises tenfold. She of course manages to adapt and has no trouble with the ocean, firing guns, dodging bullets or killing a thug with bare hands. We all know that from the game. If only Alicia Vikander alias Lara Croft wasn't so tiny. She is cute and skinny and this is why her brutality is totally unconvincing. She is a miscast just like Emilia Clarke and Jai Courtney in Terminator: Genisys. The gags feel shallow and the meeting with her father is just weird. Director Roar Uthaug probably did what he could but someone at the camp decided to waste this movie away. I wonder why it did so well at the box office.Lara gets to use a lot of equipment from the game like the grapple axe and her outfit is perfect, which is a treat for fans of the latest game releases, like me. The settings are perfect and the sound is top. There is so much potential in the visual presentation but the dialogues are uninspired and sometimes I could guess Lara's words, especially in the scene where she talks to Mr. Cast Away. Even though the action choreo is stunning the fights aren't immersive. All in all there are too many weird scenes like the shooting of a slave who is just coughing. I mean is this a film for kids, or what?If you want to watch a proper videogame adaptation be sure to see ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" (2001) with good old Angelina Jolie in the lead role. She brought the popular character to life and made her act unique and charming.",Tomb Raider
304,michaelrthomson,Just bad,1,1 June 2018,"This 'reboot' is another example of reboot fail.The story itself is simply awful, the script is terrible and then there is the acting which is simply diabolical. The cast are dull and wooden, particularly (and typically) Dominic West is just terrible, Alicia is ok, she is certainly no improvement over Angelina from the originals, and movie reboots should be like reinventing food, if you can't do it better then perhaps just don't do it at all.There is no chemistry between the main characters at all, and the flash backs add little to the supposed father/daughter relationship. Whilst the original movies were at best 'ok', I certainly would say one is better off watching the earlier incarnations than spending time here.The special effects are pretty terrible also, so don't come here hoping that may be a redeeming feature, it isn't.And as for the 'bad guy', this actor would have been better off had they not killed him off in SIX and joined that series again rather than playing this stilted and dull role, but alas.The only quality of this role is that of the sail boat captain character/actor, in a proverbial sea of s**t, he was the only one who did his job reasonably well.",Tomb Raider
305,davesawesomeinbox,Pretty Good,8,24 December 2019,"Pretty likable adventure movie with delightful reminders of the games.My only complaint would be that it felt like a long movie. Like I was feeling impatient while watching it at times. However Lara and Richard Croft's actors performed great. Maybe one other complaint would be that I couldn't help but think Gina Carano would've been perfect for the role whenever I noticed Lara's puny arms. However I adore Vikander and think she brought some positives of her own that made her a great Lara Croft.Loved the moments that alluded to the video games. Shadow of the Tomb Raider was one of my favorite games so it felt good to see elements of it brought to life. Many scenes reminded me of the games.Had some real heart to it too with the father daughter love. Nice to see a film where the love is a love for family and friends instead of the very very common romantic love that is in almost every movie out there. Granted I do like romance, but I was pleased to find a movie that doesn't shove that stuff down my throat. One is not always in the mood for romance after all.",Tomb Raider

She does it all, including some spectacular physical work. The video game, while well represented, takes second place to some serious franchise potential.

309,markj-02556,FUN,6,19 March 2018,"Tomb Raider is about Lara Croft, an independent daughter of an adventurer, who wants more than anything to find her missing father. She stumbles across a map that leads her on a whirlwind adventure.The film is directed by Roar Uthaug (The Wave). It stars Alicia Vikander (Ex Machina), Dominic West (The Wire) and Walton Goggins (Justified).This film is very rewatchable and Vikander is a great Lara Croft, she plays her as a determined and clever person which I think embodies what Lara Croft is supposed to be and In my opinion her performance is far superior to Angelina Jolie's. Uthaug is a great and promising director as well, his action sequences were particularly impressive. Tomb Raiders story is good fun and even though it has its dark moments it isn't a miserable film. However, the other actors especially Goggins, aren't as good and I think that is because the writing for there characters wasn't very strong. The writing in general isn't very strong, some lines are cringe worthy and some moments are to overly dramatic and stupid. The special effects are very poor but do not get in the way, but the editing and score are passable at best and don't do anything to stand out. Finally, in my opinion the second act is not as good as the other two and the film gets a bit boring.This is a very fun film and is good for a rainy day.6/10",Tomb Raider
310,henferdeline,"Simply stupid, even for a clearly teenage movie.",1,12 June 2018,"The plot seems to have been written by monkeys with a severe case of the munchies......they can't keep track of their own story!The new character (it is a braaaaand new Lara Croft....) is a very young woman, obviously just out of her teens.
Daddy has disappeared and supposedly passed away when she was in high school, so she simply ditches college, abandons the humongous mansion she used to live in and rejects daddy's money - she now makes a living as a delivery girl on a bike in London. 
Somehow she manages to be clean, with new clothes and a shiny bike....but ok...So, she never went to college. But she practices MMA! And cites Shakespeare from memory to her biker colleagues! A fully-fledged self-taught scholar while living on a delivery girl's wages.....eat your heart out, Batman.....Then comes the day she needs to sign her dad's death certificate and take possession of his estate. She also gets a coded apparatus which, solved in seconds right there in front of the CEO and of the lawyer, presents her with the means to access Daddy's hidden life.
She goes to the mansion, into the vault and finds out dad has been searching for an ancient Japanese witch queen, whose powers could destroy the world. (An actually quite decent IDEA for a Tomb Raider plot - but that's all they got)Well, she doesn't do as Daddy asked in a prerecorded video message and not only keeps all the notes about the said witch queen but starts on a trip to retrace his steps taking the most important notebook he left along. This is our bright young lady!She finds transport. The transport founders. She manages to save the notebook. As she gets to shore on the accursed island she sought to reach, teh bad guys capture her. And the notebook.She escapes the bad guys in a loooong sequence where she runs, falls into the water rapids, manages to grab a decaying plane before the waterfall - only to fall plane and all. But she grabbed a parachute moments before falling! It opens! All ragged, but sort of working. She falls through a forest! Lands with a metal scrap deep into her liver!A tough cookie like her wouldn't let a tiny thing like that stop her from fighting one of the bad guys that managed to get to the same spot as her, ON FOOT ACROSS THE JUNGLE AND DOWN A VERY HIGH CLIFF, just seconds after she arrives..... She kills the guy. Yes. With a deep perforation to her liver, against a fresh enemy. Chuck Norris, beware!Then she sees DADDY! Of course, he isn't dead. She follows him to his cave - midway up the cliff, which she climbs unaided, all the while bleeding....Next day, after a chat, she decides to take on the enemy (about 10 heavily armed men) with only a handmade bow and arrows (strangely industrial looking but, at this point, who cares?).
She has to go all the way back to their camp - which she does RUNNING through a jungle she doesn't know and WITH A HOLE IN HER LIVER.After that there is not much else to say....oh! Yes! The witch queen was in fact not a demon, but a martyr! 
Can't have a woman as a demon now, can we?
She was an asymptomatic virus carrier. The virus consumes the flesh of the infected IN SECONDS AFTER CONTACT. Seriously.....",Tomb Raider

I felt like Lara Croft's character was fairly advanced in terms of characteristics. The story line was strong except you could see the plot twists coming from a mile away. Overall, it was a pretty dark film and there was one plot twist that I thought made the film better which was towards the end and that I didn't see coming.

I can't imagine what went through the producers' minds when they were thinking this one up. Let's replace a stylish, charismatic, graceful woman with a street punk teenage crybaby. Let's replace a script that was fun and replace it with one that annoys you.There really is no joy in this movie. Once you get passed the spoiled princess intro, you pass into an unbelievable and predictable plot that will leave you drained with its banality and unimaginative nature. I only hope that there will be no sequel. Watch the first movie again rather than this one. You'll thank me!",Tomb Raider

I was always thinking why they can't make a film of it. Now THEY DO! Alicia Vikander portray our favorite in the best way she can. Seriously, she was in dozen of dramas. Don't get me wrong, she was very good and deserve her oscar. But in this, she can truly show her amazing skills. Lots of emotions. Plus, she is badass as an adventurer. They started the storyline in the city, where she don't want to be involve in anything her father do. But, when her father dies (the great Dominic West), she has a choice if she don't want to lose it all. And she want to discover the truth because her father give to her a key before he dies.

314,mkquinn91,Thoroughly Average Action Movie,5,2 September 2018,"This stumbles by trying to have an air of realism, but the plot is still too absurd for this to succeed. Indiana Jones works because it fully embraces myth and magic, otherwise why would we be afraid of ancient tombs? Speaking of that franchise, Tomb Raider has a couple of scenes that arguably rip off The Last Crusade.This is certainly a more competently made and acted film than the Angelina Jolie version, but at least that movie had a sense of fun about itself. I love Alicia Vikander and wouldn't mind seeing her in a sequel to this, but I hope the script is a little more original, or at least more fun.",Tomb Raider
315,infoalwaysacritic,"By the numbers, underwhelming action survival flick",5,2 December 2018,"For gamers who have played the Tomb Raider series, fond memories come to mind when thinking of the many hours enjoyed playing the games. Travelling to various parts of the world, solving puzzles, taking out mercenaries and wild animals while delving the complex ruins of the ancient world, were always married to a protagonist that was titillating and capable. Although not nearly as educational as the Assassins Creed games, education was at least a piece of its appeal, garnering interest in foreign cultures and their heritage. The character of Lara Croft herself has proved compelling enough to warrant 3 movies - one that was campy but fun, one that was too campy and now this latest reboot that is neither.Alicia Vikander deserves credit for delivering a passable performance, if you like the soft-spoken, vulnerable, girl-next-door vibe. The trouble is that the character itself has been recrafted to be a bad girl, that's not quite bad, who has explored the heights of rebellion by not going to school, becoming a hipster and refusing to accept her father's death before going on a globe-trotting adventure, which consists of one sound stage and an island, to find out what happened to her dad. Along the way she instantly solves puzzles without any explanation, transforms into a murderous unfeeling rambo and struggles to survive mercenaries, decaying airplanes, zombie superbugs and sailing at night due to her foolish decision to sell the only momento she has of the father, she supposedly cares so much about, to run off with a drunken sailor to a foreign place with an ominous name.There are no surprises, no twists, no charisma to the dialogue and she simply doesn't emote. The plot is thin, the story predictable and the effects are not up to 2018 standards. The redeeming factor is that you get to see several bloated and contrived sequences of action that place obstacles between Lara and her intended destination. This systematic action follows a videogame structure of story-telling that is only entertaining because you get to play. Watching Alicia Vikander climb over things, swim from a to b, and scramble over things that fall apart just fails to impress when the character itself is not well developed and you already know the outcome. Fortunately some of these early sequences are beautifully cinematic. Seeing Lara underwater, amidst debris, while backlit and looking very small is profound and beautifully rendered.In the end, this new film tries to be gritty and tense, serving up a mixed bag of popular trends. There's a smattering of hipsters, denial of the spiritual realm, briefly zombies, girls who don't need men because they're so strong, an obvious platonic relationship, a woman with barely any emotions who effortlessly overcomes professional soldiers in hand to hand combat despite getting her but kicked in a gym by another woman.

it is hard to believe but this is worse than the dreadful Angelina Jolie effort, if that is possible.
This is another film where the hero is bullet proof, even at close range, she also gets beaten to a pulp at least 6 times but with no real damage, I wish there was one good thing I could say about this film but I cannot honestly think of anything.
The plot is one big plot hole, nothing really makes sense, the badies are stupid and keep getting their buts kicked by Lara and no matter how many injuries or beatings she sustains she still manages to run and jump better than any Olympic champion.
The story line is so generic and boring that it is hard to believe that anyone was stupid enough to fund it.

Although, that's certainly not a commendation upon any one actor. The numerous action sequences are largely unremarkable and contrived affairs (just one of the many areas in which the film seeks to exploit every cinematic cliché conceivable). However, one scene that did impress took place on a boat immersed in a storm, and I felt the raw power and intimacy of the elements was successfully conveyed to the audience.

Sure, certain areas could have been better, but you just have to suspend your disbelief if you are to enjoy any of these action movies these days. Alicia Vikander carried the role beautifully. I wasn't sure she could pull it off, but I was pleasantly surprised. And she's one of the few actresses who actually is beautiful without makeup. Daniel Wu costarring was another bonus. I'm glad they didn't make him into a kung fu kicking cliched character. In sum, enjoyed the Jolie versions but this one is better--a bit less action-packed but with a whole lot more heart.

323,ario-34119,Almost perfect!,9,15 March 2018,"First of all, I see that some reviews are written by people who don't understand. This is not a reboot of the Tomb Raider movies. This is an adaptation of a game. The first two movies were adaptations of the old Tomb Raider games, then the game was rebooted, and this is the adaptation of that rebooted game.So comparing Jolie's Lara and Vikander's Lara is simply wrong, because they're not the same Lara. There's a huge difference in age, skills, experience and, I don't know, maybe just about everything. Actually, you don't need to play (or even know) the game to see that. The setup of this movie's character is very clear.Even if it's not an adaptation of a game, it's still a good movie. Good story, good storytelling, good performance all around and awesome action sequences. Top it all with the fact that this is based on one of my favorite game series of all time, then it becomes almost perfect!Why almost? It's too realistic for my taste. The final act could use more fantasy and creatures instead of an all too realistic explanation behind the legend/folklore. The game series it's based on IS a fantasy game anyway. It always starts out looking realistic and nothing out of the ordinary. But towards the end, it always develops into something more fantasy/magical with creatures/monsters and stuff.But yeah, maybe Uthaug thought it wasn't time for it yet for THIS Lara Croft. So maybe we'll see more fantasy and creatures on the next installment, and I have no problem with that, because it's already good as it is, and it will make the sequel(s) even better.",Tomb Raider
324,lennybuttz,Disappointing,4,17 March 2018,"I've never played the game, the only thing I know about Tomb Raider is what I saw in the Angelina Jolie movie so I was kind of expecting that kind of movie only more. I was greatly disappointed. It's a basic start at the beginning type of movie, the kind of things real fans might enjoy because it may answer some questions. It's character development which in this case is boring. It's like when a new director wants to showcase his vision of Batman and we have to sit through all that crap about his parents getting killed and the birth of his inner angst. Been there done that sick of doing it again and again. I wanted to see more. More of the real Lara Croft. More action. More excitement. More WOW! With all the hype generated about this movie what I actually got was and there's no other word to describe it, disappointment. This felt like a really long coming attractions clip for the real movie with the Lara Croft we expected.I thought Angelina Jolie embodied the character of Lara Croft, she is a tough act to follow. Alicia Vikander doesn't have the chops to do that job. She's not tough, she's prissy. She has an oddly shaped head, I often found myself staring at her big cranium and losing track of what was going on in the movie, for me it was really distracting. Usually when an actor has a physical flaw they do something to hide it, but it was out there on full display. I might sound cruel but I wish they would have shaved her head down CGI to make it look normal. It looks like she worked out for the movie, built up some muscle but she still looks too petite to play this role. I can't imagine why they chose her, the only thing I can think of is she has a slight resemblance to Jolie which in my opinion is a huge mistake. The plot and dialog are so bad all I kept thinking was how I should have saved my money and watched the original version, her slight resemblance only reinforced the idea that I could be watching the original instead of an imitation. Sorry but this didn't add up for me. If they do a sequel I hope they find a better more suitable actress for the role. (What were they thinking?)Dominic West was a very wishy washy Lord Croft, hard to believe such a milquetoast could have created this vast empire. Walton Goggins was a disappointing villain although his misshapen noggin fits the villain archetype. Yes, he and Alicia have the same oddly shaped alien cranium.

327,butterman_1999,"Alas, another useless ""remake""/""reboot""/""prequel""/""whatever"" from Hollywood",5,27 November 2019,"*** WARNING POSSIBLE SPOILERS ***It's un-necessary to say that the Angelina Jolie driven originals weren't great films. Yes, they were campy, unrealistic, but they were fun, and they had a bit of heart behind them. I can see why they would have wanted these to be a series of ongoing adventures, as well as why after the second one, it was ""enough"". But with Hollywood, ""enough"" just never is and there is always another way to over-milk the golden cow...Essentially, I thought the Tomb Raider sequel / prequel / remake / reboot / whatever to be utterly useless. Meaning of course it serves no purpose but to cash in on the namesake, and to attempt to generate enough revenue to enrich the board exécutives who pushed this into being in order to pay for their own mansions and Bentleys.Sure, it has all the ""pitfalls"" (get it?) of such a genre product: it is action-packed, has a lot of CGI to attempt to create danger, it is entertaining, and does go through all the motions and hits all the beats. To say otherwise would be to claim that the film attempts to be something than what it is: a product for mass Entertainment, Nothing more. And so on that the film succeeds, and if that is all you require out of film-going, then it settles it.But once again, Hollywood just prooves that it lacks a heartbeat and a soul, and just continues to churn out disposeable and forgettable products such as this. Oh no, is not a failure per se, the film is competently made through and through, and you can tell a lot of effort and ""man power"" (i.e. human workforce) went into this mega production.The acting is quite good and one must commend the hiring of such great performers as Kristin Scott Thomas, Derek Jacobi, Dominic West, and Walton Goggins. They are however criminally underused, but that is what the script wanted, save for Goggins who always does what he can with what he's being given, which is unfortunately not much in this film; a character he desperatly tries to flesh out as best he can (and quite the consumate professional he is), even if on page he remains but 2-dimentional.Alicia Vikander is also a competant Young actress in her own right, and she has quite a lot to carry on in a role such as this. Physically some of the stunts she performs are this side of unrealistic, strictly based by her muscle/body mass, or rather the lack thereof to make some of her stunts believable in a real world situation. However Tomb Raider began as a video game with unrealistic proportions to begin with, and thus one can easily allow such ""artistic"" freedoms to pass in a film which is obviously not based in our reality. However she does have a few annoying quirks which may have been ""forced"" during post-production in order to give the illusion of this Lara Croft to be more ""human"". Whether it is a personality trait or a production insistance will remain unknown until the inevitable sequel...Special mention to a small appearance(s) by Nick Frost, whom like most of his fellow UK thespians is alas underused beyond that of a selling point. A good little suprise which adds little meat to the proceedings, but enjoyable nonetheless.In the end, this rebooted Tomb Raider may be very competent and entertaining, but lacks the heart and soul required for any movie patron to invest in any of the characters depicted on-screen.

Vikander brings, for most of the film, a really likeable and relatable heroine. 
With her cute sassy approach and emotionally vulnerable tendencies combined with her girlishly good looks and lean as steel physique, this Lara Croft surly even topples the voluptuous Angelina Jolie in terms of being every boys fantasy girl.However these character traits seem to disappear on a dime; Lara comes across as a caring and humane individual through the first half of the film, not somebody that could harm or kill without remorse. This seems to change in a instance, in fact as soon as she lugs a bow and arrow over her shoulder - She suddenly becomes your standard issue movie action hero, putting an arrow into 'bad guy' after 'bad guy', pretty much on the same level as the likes of Legolas from LOTRS.

335,orlando-somera,Vikander proves herself a nearly unbeatable action hero,8,21 March 2018,"I admit I went in thinking Alicia Vikander is unusually attractive. I can't help being drawn to her which makes me an easy mark, I suppose. Still, I'm convinced her athleticism and uncanny ability to express what could really be felt in a situation, however outlandish, will be riveting for the majority of viewers. I can't remember the last time I couldn't follow a heroine's actions without holding my breath, while believing she could actually pull off the highly risky moves she manages, and worried she might actually get hurt.When a guy does it, I don't have the same level of concern, it's mostly admiration for their physical abilities. It's not that easy to feel their every move. Alicia somehow transcends all that, despite her not having a male bone in her body.A lot of the credit has to go to the director who somehow saw in Alicia someone who can relate to risking her life. That's not been my experience with most good-looking women, but with Alicia, he was clearly right. She's great to watch and if I had a daughter I'd be sure she saw this movie. It's not perfect, but it's easily the best beginning for a series led by a female heroine I've ever seen.",Tomb Raider
336,mt-95256,Finally! The First Half-Decent Videogame Movie!,7,19 March 2018,"TL;DR
The first actually half-decent videogame movieInspired by the game, more than just a copy of the storySome original additions refresh the story for those who have played the gameOther original additions feel more like Indiana Jones rip-offsAction is enjoyable and well-done (unlike many other videogame movies)Vikander is a great Lara CroftThe villain is a bit too bland----------------------------------------Videogame movies are always bad. It's a classic rule that people have picked up on over the last 20 years or so. Sometimes the story doesn't necessarily translate well to the big screen; they try to be too faithful an adaptation; the action just doesn't work when you're a passive consumer; or they're just badly made films, created solely for easy money. Nevertheless, there was a certain excitement for Tomb Raider, and with every passing trailer and poster, there seemed to be a glimmer of hope. 'Would this be the first actually decent videogame movie?' we all asked. So does it break the trend? Fortunately, on the whole, yes - this is the first videogame movie that isn't bad. It's still far from the quality of the game on which it's based, but there's lots to enjoy and celebrate. Largely because, unlike tragic videogame movies before, Tomb Raider is not pretending to be the game.The story itself isn't necessarily a direct adaptation from the 2013 reboot Tomb Raider. Instead the Tomb Raider film takes inspiration from the game and bases the story on its ideas, but the story itself is not identical. This difference is a double-edged sword with both positive and negative results. On one hand, the beginning of the film gives more personality to Lara's character, allowing us to delve deeper into her backstory than the game. It gives us more time to learn who Lara is before she sets off on her adventure and this is a strong point of the film. Other differences are particularly worthwhile since they make the film's story much more interesting for those who have already completed the game, even to 100% completion (humble-brag). Even Himiko, the Macguffin herself, is different, keeping the whole movie fresh.On the other hand, however, there are parts of Tomb Raider that come across more as references to its source game, such as the plane and parachute sequence. Still, these are still enjoyable moments. One larger issue that derives from deviating from the original story though is that some ""original"" elements of the plot instead come straight from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade; there's an argument about not burning a diary with notes in; there's a scene in which tiles from the ground fall, letting the victims fall to their death. Minor issues aside, the plot overall works well. It's a typical action-adventure with a macguffin or two at its centre - but I love those stories, growing up on a diet of Tintin and Indiana Jones. The biggest criticism regarding the story is the shameless setting up of a sequel; at least that's only in the final few minutes though.The Lara Croft games however were never intended to be primarily about story - they were for action; be it combat, gymnastics or endless wall-climbing, pole-swinging and jumping. As it goes, the action in the Tomb Raider film is better than we've come to expect from videogame movies. So many have silly action scenes trying too hard to replicate the gameplay, adding in some cinematic slow-mo to make it seem like a spectacle but ending up making it ridiculous and laughable. Here though the action it totally fit for film and is done well. There are still action-oriented elements taken directly from the game that stand out somewhat, but not as drastically as you might think; scaling cliff walls, frantically climbing up a crumbling wall with a climbing axe, convenient 'monkey bars' falling into place when trying to escape a capsizing ship. Though originating from the game, they don't feel too out of place in the film.Alicia Vikander makes a very good Lara Croft all in all. As you'd hope from an Oscar-winning actress, she lends some more believability to the character and makes her consistently likable. It laughs at the awful Angelina Jolie films; there's just no comparison. Although fierce and independent, there's an innocent streak to her in the beginning that soon becomes a hardened, steely determination. More than that, like the reboot game itself, Vikander doesn't need to strip down to a scanty costume - she's a beauty with brains and that makes her all the stronger. She's certainly the star of the film, but there's a decent supporting cast with her father and Lu Ren, but it's a shame not enough was given to Goggins' antagonist. His performance is charismatic and enigmatic enough for him to be a competent villain, but there's nothing special and memorable about him, other than a fairly comical name.On the face of it, Tomb Raider isn't ground-breaking stuff. It's a competent, enjoyable enough blockbuster; a decent popcorn flick, but still hasn't got anything on the likes of Indiana Jones. Still, this is the first time a movie based on a videogame hasn't been flat out bad - so perhaps there's more to praise here than you may think. And judging by the end, a sequel will soon be on the horizon. Let's hope Lara can hit an even bigger target next time out.",Tomb Raider
337,Iusedtobeacat,Better than the once starring Angelina Jolie,7,28 March 2018,"I remember watching the movies released with Angelina Jolie in them more than a decade ago, that was my first introduction to Lara Croft as a character and I remember hating her for years to come, not that Angelina Jolie was a bad actress or anything but the plot in those films were tremendously obnoxious and the character seemed beyond comical. This movie is a big improvement over that, is it realistic? No, but it had elements of realism in it. Lara Croft is a more relatable character in this version of events, she's a human not an action figure. A person with motives and aspirations. Some of the other characters got on my nerves but I think the ending wrapped it pretty well. Since this is the first movie, the plot for sure could have been better but it deliveres what is it promised to do. A cohesive plot, three diemnsionl characters and entertaining action scenes. It's a bit nostalgic since it reminded me a lot of Indiana Jones but with a strong female lead instead. Looking forward for a sequel.",Tomb Raider

Angelina very well fit in the leading role of Lara Croft and she led the film and the story. However, Vikander does not have any dynamics, as if she is trying to crawl (almost literally) throughout the film. Either they chose the wrong actress to play the legendary Lara Croft, or they purposely chose Vikander in order to ruin the character and its associations. Angelina's Lara Croft had everything Lara Croft would have in real life: money, intelligence, charm, dynamics, story, the talent for acting. Vikander failed to deliver all of this. It was all about ""daddy, daddy, daddy""... ...Not to mentioned a little stupid story with the Japanese black magic ruler. Everything is just falling apart in this film.

341,jason-210,Fun Adventure Film with great characters.,8,30 March 2020,"My family and I watch films every weekend and we have been very selective over the years, watching only the best. We don't watch rubbish. However, we've watched that many that it's hard to find new ones that are good. So we gave this a try. I was a bit sceptical beforehand, but after 15 minutes we were all enjoying this movie. My son loved it.What I enjoyed the most was the new take on Lara Croft. Right from the start I liked the new character as portrayed by Alicia Vikander and the fact that she's not some Marvel super hero who wins every battle. I liked the acting and how Vikander transformed the role into a convincing person we can relate to instead of a comic book character with big boobs. She is vulnerable. We see her lose a fight in the ring at the start, then fall off her bike because she got distracted, and nearly get knifed by her robbers in Hong Kong.I like the fact that the film starts with a London setting and has British actors like Derek Jacobi in it.It's been criticised for having a poor story that starts off promisingly but fails to deliver. The story is a cliché and perhaps it does border on the mediocre, but it was good enough vehicle for Alicia Vikander's new character. It's not a great film, but neither, in my opinion, was Raiders of the Lost Ark or any of the other Indian Jones films which belong to this same genre.We're looking forward to the sequel which I hope will be successful.

344,ChipperX,"A Visceral Reimagining Of An ""Old"", Cult Classic.",10,16 March 2018,"Tomb Raider (2018).Chipper F. Xavier, Esq.Lara Croft (Alicia Vikander) is an orphan seeking to make her way in the world after the mysterious disappearance of her father, Lord Richard Croft (Dominic West) seven years hence. When an unexpected discovery unlocks new clues to her father's absence, Lara uses everything she has to uncover the truth, but nothing could prepare her for what she finds.Director Roar Uthaug (The Wave 2015) and writers Geneva Robertson-Dworet, Alastair Siddons and Evan Daughtery take on the near-impossible task of re-tooling the cult classic Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001) starring the inimitable Angelina Jolie. Many teams would have balked at such a task, but Uthaug and company pull off this reimagining with surprisingly fresh and stylish results.The secret ingredient to this action-packed sauce: Alicia Vikander. Vikander has muscled-up and totally gotten into character for her latest star vehicle, and her Lara is as tough as she is tender. After brilliant, starring roles in movies such as Ex Machina (2014), The Danish Girl (2015) and The Man From U.N.C.L.E (2015), it is no wonder that this femme fatale delivers a lethal cocktail of charisma, wit, personality and strength in Tomb. Adding yet more flavor to the brimming broth is the supporting cast of Dominic West, Walton Goggins as villain Mathias Vogel, Daniel Wu, and Kristin Scott Thomas. Remarkably, the supporting cast as well do an amazingly competent job of pointing this ship in the right direction.Set pieces for Tomb are remarkably intricate, from the beautifully filmed streets of London to the untamed wilds of South Africa - there is nearly always something in the background which catches your eye and sets the mind to wander.If there is criticism to be levied, one need only look to the film's 1 hour and 58 minute runtime, which is stretching the viewer's attention just a tad for this brand of fare.Tomb Raider, if successful, is meant to be launched as a series, and I for one am eager and curious to see what its next installment has in store.",Tomb Raider

347,ravs05,Finally a decent Video-Game-Film Adaptation,7,21 March 2018,"I finally got to see this film yesterday with myself and just one more person at the screening. Not that the cinema is empty 'cause its bad but its empty 'cause I picked an early morning show on a working day. So, it almost felt like a private screening. I chose an extra-comfy screen right at the centre of the screen and it was a really immersive, exciting experience. My obsession with video games started with Prince of Persia and Tomb Raider, Prince during the early DOS days and Tomb Raider during the early Windows PC days. Laura Croft holds a very special place in my heart as I fondly recall those countless hours where I used to get lost in the adventure on my PC running Window Me. The graphical element of the game was cutting edge back then and so was the near perfect Laura Croft. She looked like she popped out straight of a teenage boys dream. So, it was a delight playing her back then. And when they decided to make a live action film with Angelina Jolie, I was super excited. The 2 films in which she played Laura Croft were plain ok, but still they are one of my guilty pleasures and I do watch them from time to time. Fast-forward 15 years and an awesome video game reboot and an equally impressive sequel later, things were really looking up for Laura on the gaming platform, as the whole PS2 era was a disaster. Then comes the big film adaptation of the rebooted video game creating huge buzz about who will be cast as the young and vulnerable adventure seeker. And when Alicia Viaknder's name was announced, I had mixed feelings. I loved her in Ex-Machina but not sure if she had the appeal of Laura Croft.Now lets me summerize how it all holds up especially when the film makers had an uphill task as till date, I don't think there is one extremely brilliant film adaption of a video game. (I would like to cite Sands of Time, the first 2-3 of Resident Evil movies as my favourites)First lets start with The Good: 
The film really tries to be a good and faithful adaptation instead of a carbon copy of the video game. The entire setup leading to Laura's first adventure is fun to watch. Alicia Viaknder did immerse herself to the role and conveyed all the turbulent emotions of Laura Croft to perfection. The story, despite focusing once again on father-daughter relationship does not drag much or slow the pace. Couple of action sequences are brilliant, especially the rusted plane jump scene and events that follow which thankfully were not shown in the trailer. The changes which they made to the story from the video game are brilliant and suit well for a live action movie. This pleasantly surprised me and din't give that 'know-it-all' feeling since you already played the game. There definitely is something new to look forward to even if you have played the game a few times.Now the Bad: 
Alicia Vikander did put her heart and soul to the role, but she definitely is missing Laura's X factor. Whilst Angelina Jolie felt that someone straight up plucked her from computer screens and made her live, Vikander surely was lacking that awe-factor of Laura. I read somewhere that actress Gemma Arterton was a huge fan and wanted to played the iconic role, she really would have been awesome as Laura. Then the story, I really wish they could have skipped the origin or incorporated it by adapting the second instalment of the game. The film ends on a very high note and I am actually looking forward to the sequel as this has a better and exciting story to tell. Then the action sequences, the cool ones are all shown in the trailers and there is nothing extra in the film and this leaves you wanting for more. Not sure what is it with movie trailers these days! Guess with Netflix and Amazon Prime, it is getting really difficult to get people into cinemas so they are ending up showing all the good bits in the trailers in order to reel audiences in. So, the best action sequences of the film are already covered in the trailers!Finally the Ugly: 
Thankfully, there is nothing to write here. The movie really is one of the well-made video game adaptations. It could have been perfect if there were more action sequences and a better Laura Croft.. but good is equal to GREAT considering the history of video-game adaptations so far. I seriously am looking forward for the sequel as it can have Laura actually raiding Tombs and solving mysteries instead of focusing on the same old father-daughter story.",Tomb Raider
348,childers-3,Underwhelmed,4,6 November 2018,"I agree with many of the reviews on this site. It was just sort of ""there"". I like Alicia Vikander, but, the problem I had with Atomic Blonde, I had with this one too. Tiny women CANNOT and WOULD NOT be able to fight a man, unless said man had some kind of injury or handicap. Women just don't have upper body strength like that. I know, it's only a movie, but it takes me completely out of it when women go up against men in hand-to-hand combat. Unless they're a superhero of some kind - it ain't gonna happen. She was fast and strong, but, it still felt fake. I guess these types of movies are not to my taste anymore. Once you've seen Raiders of the Lost Ark, everything else pales in comparison.The plot is like the plot of hundreds of similar movies - I won't go into it here. It was not a terrible movie, it was just underwhelming.

351,christian-larson,"Boring, cliche film",1,18 March 2018,"Tomb Raider is the latest video game adaptation by Roar Uthaug, a nameless director. Rarely is a video game movie good, in fact, its never good. Its no surprise here. This is your typical action movie with your typical dialogue and typical everything. It's very cliched and flawed. The direction and script are awful. I was never entertained during the movie. There is no attempt to make an interesting character out of Lara. She never learns anything, she never has any arcs nor any development. There is no style in this movie, it's so factory based, its disgusting. There's nothing special about the camerawork, the editing, nothing is even remarkably good. Its just below average. The editing is ok. The color grading is actually pretty gross looking. Its so frustrating that you have a beautiful jungle and it looks disgusting since the color grading is all gray and ugly. There are some nice shots of the beach and of a camera following Lara running. But that's it. Everything else is either boring, average, or, painfully cringe inducing. The dialogue in this film is atrocious. Most of the dialogue is cliched and conventional, and some of them are so cringe. The ending tries to make an ""intriguing"" twist, but it just falls flat completely. It comes out of nowhere and in retrospect, it does not make sense at all. The acting is also really bad. Alicia VIkander does a terrible job, and her shouts in the movie are so laughable. It's sad that this movie actually takes itself seriously. Don't see it. 
3/10",Tomb Raider
352,darryl-42069,A worthy successor to the Angelina Jolie films.,7,10 March 2018,"Video game movies are most of the time, follows a pattern: The movie stars one of Hollywood's most bankable actor/actress, a decent, well made trailer that showed some potential, and some really good BTS footage that keeps fans hoping that the curse will finally be broken. But eventually everything went in vain as the movie crash and burn in the box office, complete with bad reviews and not-so-promising box office results. Assassin's Creed, despite I was pleasantly enjoyed the movie, proved that even Michael Fassbender can't break the video game curse.Now with 2018's Tomb Raider, the reboot of Angelina Jolie's (surprisingly decently bad) movie series of the same name, now based on Square Enix/Crystal Dynamics 2013's game coming up this March, will Alicia Vikander could live up to it's predecessor, and probably break the curse? I'd say... Yes... and no.First of all, Alicia Vikander successfully captures the Lara Croft persona. She's really good in this movie, and it really shows that she's really dedicated for this role. Dominic West as Lara's father Richard also did a great job. Walton Goggins (who I found disturbing here since his face resembles a skull, no offense) is also very good in this movie. Daniel Wu doesn't do much in this movie, but he did a good job as well.The action scenes looked fluid, real and grounded. It's clear that Vikander really go hard on this one, doing her own stuntwork and got bruises here and there. The set pieces, the cinematography and the music by Junkie XL really captures the danger that our main leads are facing. The nods to the original Tomb Raider at the end of the movie is also a nice touch. Director Roar Uthaug really knows how to keep the action going, and the end result look fluid and great.However despite have everything that set this movie to a great start, it was bogged down by a number of problems. The movie has some of the most noticable CGI this year has to offer. Every shot that involves CGI looks bad and fake. The plot has, as usual with many movies coming these days, a number of plot holes. The big bad guy is, as usual, evil guy who wants this thing nomatter the cost (y'know, Hollywood bas guy cliche). There's also a scene in the movie that (might) ""blind"" you due to bright shuttering lights. Also, the final ""dramatic"" reveal/twist clearly sets up a sequel (which I don't know whether or not they'll succeed because I don't think this movie will please everyone)But nevertheless, I really had a good time with Tomb Raider. The CGI's bad, the bad guy's really bad, and plenty of plot holes and questions unanswered, but the performances and some great stuntwork really saves this movie from being a snoozefest. Does it lived up to the Angelina Jolie movies? Yes. Does it broke the video game curse?.... Maybe not, but it's certainly one step to the right direction.Overall: 7/10

.
After the flop of the cradle of life back to 2003, i didn't want to come a fast sequel as fast as (cradle of life) because it was disaster.Anyway years went by and when i first heard about giving Alicia the role i was sure she would be the perfect choice for the reboot because she really look alike the new game character and after watching it i was convinced much more of that, she really developed herself, her body even her style of walking talking like Lara Croft.
However, the problem of this film was the story line or the script :First : the main elements of the film was exactly the same of the 2001 version.
(Lara croft dad is dead or to be specific presumed dead , and the main character is the one who killed him! and the final fight between Lara and him is almost identical) the difference is that in the 2001 version Lara tries to bring her father back to life, here she is searching for him.Second : the action scenes are few which didn't allow us to see Alicia's Strength (even though some scenes are shot in a great way, but that doesn't help the film.third : the story is so predictable which means you won't get surprised by any event.fourth: Lara Strength : in this film she is supposed to become the Tomb Raider which means she must to gain power through her travel because she only a regular person who only plays kickboxing, nevertheless one scene we see her weak and the other weak and that showed a lot in the film.Finally ; the villain character was almost identical of (Manfred Powell) which was the main villain of the 2001 version.Nevertheless the film is enjoyable and has it's moments and Alicia was great as Lara, but if someone asked me which one do you recommend i go with the 2001 version because it has a lot of action scenes with a lot of fun, but this film is definitely much away better than the 2003 version .",Tomb Raider

that been said, the croft girl has no training in martial arts or anything. she can't win a fight in a box but yet she can kill a fully professional and trained mercenary. On what drugs the film writers were on while making this movie is totally beyond me. 
okay so the croft girl has some serious daddy issues. and guess what her daddy is alive after all these years. really? that's the best the writers can come up with?
now the dialogues. ""you messed with the wrong family"" sshhh really??
better to play the tomb raider 1996 version instead of watching this total crap.
i watched tomb raider 2001 after watching this crap and guess what i totally loved it. a shame that after 17 years they come up with this B.S and crap.
please avoid at all cost and buy yourself a nice burger instead",Tomb Raider
365,DontKnowMuchAboutFilms,Meh,6,18 April 2020,"🎬
While the movie itself looks great with bright colors shining on, the story is pretty bland. Having plain played all the current games, I didn't really care for what they did to the story. Lara herself is played fine, but her characters does things that I just didn't like. Mostly acted well by all, ultimately this movie falls short of my expectations, and therefore, it's something I probably won't watch again.",Tomb Raider
366,PStyles,Not Completely Terrible,6,5 December 2018,"Let me preface by saying that i've played most of the Tomb Raider games, both new and old, and I am completely in love with Alicia Vikander; thus I may be somewhat biased. However, i'll try to be as objective as possible.I'll start by saying that this movie is pretty predictable; I found myself guessing plot events before they even happened. Ususally this is a big turnoff, but in the case of this film it was not.What makes this movie interesting is the set pieces, locale, and the origin story. Those who grew up destroying dudes with duel pistols as Lara will probably want to, at the very least, give this one a look. You can definitely see the parallels between the games and this film, which I enjoyed. There are also some pretty cool similarities between the 2013 reboot video game and this movie, which I also enjoyed.The acting is ok; Vikander does a good job as Lara and Dominic West does a fine job as Richard Croft. The screen time shared between the 2 are perhaps some of the best moments of the film. The rest of the cast is, well, mediocre. They get the job done and i'll leave it at that.The ending is probably the least predictable portion of this entire film and I enjoyed that. It broke the chain, so to speak, of me guessing what would happen next.In conclusion, there are some awesome set pieces, lots of explosions, and Lara running aroung shooting fools with a bow and arrow. The acting all around was pretty mediocre (sans a few actors mentioned above), and the plot is relatively predictable. With that being said, it's not a terrible movie at all and is worth seeing if you are a Tomb Raider fan. Also, there will most definitely be a sequel. At the very least, this film is leagues better than the ones starring Angelina Jolie which were pretty awful.",Tomb Raider
367,nagyistvanandor,this is just not Lara Croft,3,17 April 2018,"Did we really needed a reboot movie of a video game that was rebooted it self? I have a feeling if the studio would have surveyed movie going audience about this, a large part of the result would have been ""Hell no""So from my point of view the movie already started with the chance of a one legged puppy crossing the highway.But still with being faithful to the character and lore, and coming up with good script they could have dodged the bullet. They did not.Lara should be smart, educated, confident, a diva, and adventurer. Instead she's a uneducated delivery girl who takes boxing lessons, have no interest in adventure or archeology, and crushed by a ""daddy is gone"" complex It somewhat reminded me to Jyn Erso... whats up with the trend of strong female characters only can be called to action by there missing father? Also In the game Lara is an educated archeologist, on her first big adventure, interested in founding the mystery. the movie is either dumb or predictable and dumb. If You seen any cursed tomb adventure movie, theres nothing You have not seen jet. The villain is flat and uninspired... in the game he was not really present or explored deeply, but still was way more interesting than the movie version.I would be happy to see strong female characters on the big screen, with the actress it self trying it best to make it work.. but with that said thats not enough to carry a lazy movie.",Tomb Raider
368,bernardoarquivo,Pretty good,10,1 June 2018,"It's funny reading hate reviews that use words like ""abominable"" or ""avoid at all costs"" to describe a simple action flick. This is not David Lean or Costa Gavras; it's not a morality play or a piece with deep philosophical issues or political values; it's the reboot of a movie based on a freaking video game. Some people need to relax a bit and learn to just enjoy movies.And it's a pretty good reboot. it's a nice mix of Lara, Raiders of the lost ark and The Mummy. Yes, it is cliched and the screenplay is weak but Alicia Vikander is awesome as always and the action scenes are gripping. Not much more we could ask from it.

370,maverick-84924,Don't Believe the Negatives,8,2 June 2018,"This new reboot of the Tomb Raider franchise is just what the doctor ordered. Much like the recent games, Lara's character is a young, vulnerable girl who evolves throughout the movie, rather than a superhero from the get go.It seems plenty of people don't quite get that in the first instance, but the level of vitriol against this movie is certainly unwarranted. A few minutes checking the negative reviews explains quite a bit. One reviewer whines about the lack of Lara's signature twin pistols. Apparently they didn't see, hear of or even play the new rebooted games because those weapons aren't present as part of Lara's character development (She's not the iconic ""Tomb Raider"" in them yet). Amusingly though, she actually buys the two pistols at the end of the movie, so I'm guessing said reviewer didn't actually watch the actual movie?Another bemoans Vikander as a pale imitation to Angelina's version. Once again, they didn't get the memo about this not being like the original games and based, instead, on the newer reboots.It appears that most were expecting the old, huge bosomed action hero, rather than the younger, more realistic character and have been denied their fap-time. A grand shame.In the real world, this is an excellent reboot of the franchise and Vikander's portrayal is excellent. She was brilliant in Ex Machina and shines again here. I look forward to more in the franchise, much the same way as I loved the reboots on Playstation.",Tomb Raider
371,camlee-37161,Great movie; similar to video game!,8,29 November 2019,"Comparing previous Tomb Raider movies to this one featuring Alicia Vikander definitely stood out!
Personally I have never been able to play the video games because I can not afford to keep up with them. However, seeing the comparison to short clips on YouTube, this movie definitely tried to shape it around the video game I could tell.

372,grahamvandyke,"""Oh no... not again.""",5,30 May 2018,"Those were the literal words in my head from the first sequence at the beginning of the movie. I had seen this same, tired drivel opener to B-grade movies and immediately knew what I was in for. But hope! Alicia Vikander was absolutely brilliant in Ex Machina and I was very excited to see her taking the role of one of my favorite movies when I was 13 (for obvious reasons from Angelina Jolie's Lara Croft). From there it was a bit of a confusing blur. I had to stop the movie at the halfway mark and actually queued up the original Lara Croft movie. I originally stopped it at around the quarter mark, but decided to continue to give the movie a chance. I knew at the halfway mark that it was a B-grade movie through and through with nothing new or exciting to offer. ""Confused"" is the most apt description for this movie. The directing was very vanilla. The action scenes uninspired and too familiar. The script too. The character development. Everything was just too familiar and confused. The one shining ray of light in the movie was Alicia Vikander's charisma, stunt work and amazingly shredded transformation, despite her character seeming to ping-pong between badassery to damsel-in-destress. This could have been a fantastic reboot of a classic video game franchise, but unfortunately it missed the mark by a mile.",Tomb Raider

374,CriticalRaccoon,A Descent Into Banality,3,17 July 2020,"Can a movie that cost $100-million also be zero effort? ""Tomb Raider"" seeks to answer that question.Riding off the success of the 2013 ""Tomb Raider"" video game reboot in which Lara Croft gets a ""realistic"" makeover, a blander personality and exaggerated daddy issues, the 2018 film adaptation of ""Tomb Raider"" by Norwegian director Roar Uthaug is about as lazy of an action-adventure film as I've ever seen. It's not bad, it's just a checklist.Starting off we're given narration covering a legend about an ancient Queen Himiko who had the power to kill all she touched and was entombed in a remote island to protect the world, and that Lara's father abandoned her in order to find it first. This is trademark terrible cinema 101 material right here: opening narration that will be repeated in-film by the end of the first act. That or someone forgot to film a proper opening.Immediately we jump to a plucky Lara Croft (Alicia Vikander) getting her butt kicked in a gym (a running theme). An heiress Richard Croft's (Dominic West) gigantic fortune, Lara refuses her inheritance because she believes her father is still alive after going missing years ago - living her day-to-day life as a poor bike courier for no good reason. I guess they made her ""poor"" for 15-minutes because it would make her ""relatable"" (despite her reason for not having money making little sense) as opposed to her previous screen incarnation which was bordering on goofy. Oh and a bike chase scenes because why not. After a run-in with the law Lara seems to accept her father is dead to claim her inheritance (after a totally-not-evil relative manipulates her), until she finds a key and learns of a ""secret"" her father was looking to find to ""protect"" the world - namely, Himiko and some vaguely defined evil group named Trinity seeking to use her power. Richard's message warns Lara to destroy everything related to Himiko so her power could never be used by Trinity. Lara, of course, ignores this because she wants to see her dad again. Golly, I wonder where this is going ...Picking up Richard's trail - as in the one clue that leads straight to him with zero investigation needed - Lara travels to Hong Kong, gets into trouble and runs into a drunken Lu Ren (Daniel Wu). Lu Ren is son of the man Richard had hired to take him to find Himiko who was also named Lu Ren (comedy?) and the pair go off to find their fathers in the Devil's Sea. Their boat gets wrecked near the island and everyone who played the 2013 video game is immediately having flashbacks. Lara manages to find her way to the beach only to get captured by the generic movie villain Mathias (Walton Goggins) - the man who has spent years on the island looking for the same treasure Richard was afraid would fall into the wrong hands. Oh no, Lara accidentally might have doomed the world!A few stolen scenes from the 2013 video game and some blatant ""Indiana Jones"" thievery later and Lara figures out her place in the world and sets up a probably terrible sequel.""Tomb Raider"" is without a doubt one of the laziest action-adventure screenplays I've seen put to film. It is designed to be the most ""okay"" movie it could possibly be with zero chances taken, zero prospect of enjoyment and zero attempt to capture what made ""Tomb Raider"" an iconic franchise. Roar Uthaug and his three story/screenplay writers created this hollow shell of a movie; ""Tomb Raider"" has nothing going on under the surface. This is screenplay-by-checklist of things that ""need"" to be in a ""Tomb Raider"" film - namely the good action bits of the 2013 video game - and then padded to get to an acceptable length. The script is purely functional with zero real emotion or coherence, with a few one-liners that you can see Vikander's contempt for. Vikander is an immensely talented actor who is slumming it in this mess of genre tropes and a script that can at best be described as functional.""Tomb Raider"" also skips over character development in favor a predictable ""daddy issues"" backstory for Lara Croft because, well, 2013 Lara has little personality. Lara's only character trait is her need for her father - she has no identity outside of that. The closest thing to personality she has is the occasional joke in the first half before her new defining characteristic is getting the crap beat out of her. Most frustrating is that Lara remains silent for most of the final act while her father and Mathias deliver all the exposition - making Lara into a supporting character in her own movie. Lara's lack of personality might have to do with this version of Lara having zero friends or compatriots to bounce off of - seriously ""Tomb Raider"" has at most 4 plot-relevant characters, including Lara! The only moment I liked Lara Croft is when she was bartering with the distracting cameo of Nick Frost as a pawn shop owner, perhaps because Nick Frost is just that awesome. Alicia Vikander at times looks like she is trying to drag ""Tomb Raider"" out of the mud with her abilities and charm, but like Lara somehow surviving lethal injuries multiple times, by the end it looks like she's had enough of it.If you played the 2013 ""Tomb Raider"" video game you've already seen the best bits of the ""Tomb Raider"" movie, and it's the only time ""Tomb Raider"" feels like it has life. The film borrows a lot from that game once it (finally) gets to the island, including the almost absurd levels of abuse Lara gets subjected to. Bonus points for not having an ""about to get raped"" scene like the 2013 game did. At all other moments ""Tomb Raider"" is a slog; there is almost an aversion to fun.Oh, and most infuriating, the tomb. It seems that zero effort went into making the Tomb and puzzle sequences of ""Tomb Raider"" anything other than boring. The film features literally a single trap sequence that will give you ""Indiana Jones And The Last Crusade"" flashbacks. Heck, eagle eyed viewers who know anything about color mixing will see that the one puzzle-based trap features a glaring mistake - trying to make Lara look smart made the writers look dumb. I know that the 2013 ""Tomb Raider"" game virtually eliminated the puzzle/trap aspect, but the movie's attempt to rectify that mistake was lazy at best.Even if ""Tomb Raider"" is derivative as hell, at least it's functional. The action scenes tend to be pretty well done despite the shoddy CGI and zero investment.. The scenery on the island is nice to look at even if it takes far too long to get there. Vikander does look the part of a muscular reboot Lara Croft and should probably be able to slaughter her way through this entire militia if the script didn't randomly make her lose fights all the time. ""Tomb Raider"" is a by-the-numbers retelling of the beloved franchise that sadly takes a lot of what made the games memorable out of the story, but for those who just wanted a generic action-adventure flick to sit back and watch there are far worse things to put on.I can pretty safely say that in a week I will barely remember ""Tomb Raider."" Usually in a bad movie with a big budget you can kind of see what they were trying to do - with ""Tomb Raider"" there is nothing. It's such a bland mix of generic scenes and borrowed setpieces that I question if any effort was put in making this movie outside of Alicia Vikander getting buff. Making a ""Tomb Raider"" movie is not rocket science, but somehow Uthaug and his compatriots managed to find a way to make an exciting game into a bad ""Indiana Jones"" ripoff. Vikander seems to be the only person who took this project seriously, and at times you can almost see her annoyance with what ""Tomb Raider"" became.",Tomb Raider

As many people have already said, Alicia is probably the only reason to go see this movie - she's amazing indeed. Her performance, fight scenes, and looks included.The story however, isn't very good. There are tons and tons of plot holes (even when you're not looking for it), and honestly, I can see the same story being a good game, but it doesn't adapt to movie well.

Goggins particularly has proved time and time again what a great actor he is and usually his best work is as a villain.The film simply had no heart, a bad script and poor dialogule. the characters change personalities so fast you don't have chance to even care what happens to any of themLarge chunks of the film make no sense and seem to be put in just because the writer/director were not sure how to proceed and one part of the storyline was clearly pushed in just so somebody could have a cameo.Yes the original Tomb Raider films were not master pieces but they were fun, this film was not fun in the slightest and it really is a shame they wasted a good cast.If however you are a fan of the crap Hollywood churns out, such as the Avengers, you are probably gong to enjoy this.",Tomb Raider

Her supporting cast is as bland as hell - I never cared about any of them. Lara's father repeats the same 5 lines over and over. Their emotional connection is nonexistent. The other characters are so boring I can barely remember them. The main antagonist is a walking cliche. The Asian guy that tags along with Lara is completely pointless, I'm not sure how to describe their relationship - What is the word for the polar opposite of ""chemistry"" ???The opening scenes are criminally boring. Lara refuses to accept her inheritance of the Croft family fortune for ridiculous reasons, so is in desperate need of money. She enters some biking contest where she has to outride the rest. Perhaps an opportunity for an exciting chase? No, she hops on the back of a van instead. Is this supposed to be entertaining for the audience? Lara comes across as obnoxious tbh - is this not blatant cheating?? Whatever.. She sells her father's precious amulet instead. How noble, I guess..So off to a mysterious island - maybe the plot will pick up a bit here? Unfortunately not. Did this film even have an art department? If so, they needed to be fired! There is no lush jungle, turquoise beaches or exotic life to be found - this empty place feels more like a dusty car-park.Lara is useless - she certainly doesn't ""raid"" any tomb, but is instead pushed through it at gunpoint. And what a pathetic place the titular tomb is! The film seems to be actively trying to make it as boring as possible.. So how is this ancient cursed tomb revealed? Perhaps hidden behind a dramatic waterfall, or at the peak of a majestic mountain. Well no actually, it appears to be on a dirty building site under a pile of rubble.. How exciting! NOT.There's no thrills to be found once we enter the tomb either. No piles of treasure, beautiful statues or painted walls - instead a bland grey blur. The group is faced with a deep chasm. Oh how will they get across?? Maybe a dangerous rope bridge or precarious climbing.. No, they just walk across a ladder. Tedious! And Lara's famous puzzle solving is whittled down to a PATHETIC ""colour trick."" Yellow and blue combines to make green -- That's it! Such genius..It's laughably ironic that the one puzzle in the film is based on colour - considering the director seems to be incapable of using it.. The entire film is shot through this yellow haze. At best it looked ugly, and at worst it made me want to vomit. The direction itself seems embarrassed by it's own incompetence. In near-constant closeup, no wide panoramic shots - the viewer is rarely gifted even a glimpse of any surroundings.This is no Lara Croft. A sexless, lifeless, boring moaner. The plot is generic - and the characters make illogical idiotic choices that make no sense. Any twist is painfully obvious and easy to predict. By the end I was just glad it was over!

386,rolando19552001,Tomb Raider Lara Croft,8,16 March 2018,"Tomb Raider Lara Croft The film is good cinema, the actress that plays the title role, Alicia Vikander is the backbone of the film and she makes you invested in her character which is full of empathy and charisma. The film is a mystery, thriller and action and adventure film combined with all the former elements to make the film worked very well, it is a solid hit, a solid double, even a home run. The elements of the mystery of the film entails the disappearance of Lara´s father, Richard Croft who after his wife´s death he takes time to read and research about historical stories backed and formed by myth and history. One of the themes of the film, is that sometimes with myth, there is a historical backing that began the myth or legend in the first place. This is what happened and the main engine of the film, Richard Croft, Lara´s father discovered through great magisterial research and investigation that in Japan, in the Death Sea, where there are about 400 islands, in one of those uninhabited islands, there is a great danger that had been trapped there centuries ago. Through his research Richard Croft finds the lost mythical queen Himiko, of the curse island of Yamakai. There is a dark hand organization called the Trinity that wants to find the queen Himiko, literally the queen of death and destruction. Lara continues her life after her father´s disappearance, but she is always hopeful that she will find him, a blind faith that she will be reunited with him, an instinct that would drive her to risk her life to find him, or at least learned what happened to Richard, the elder Croft. Lara finds with some clues of Japanese puzzles, the whereabouts of his father, or at least the last place he visited. Lara finds that a man in Hong Kong transported his father, with this clue, she goes to Hong Kong and finds the son of the man who brought his father to this lost and doomed island. The son Lu Ren, is lured by Lara´s money, Lu Ren is addicted to gambling, to go to the island, but his man reason is that he wants to know what happened with his lost father. The two of them managed to find the island with the notes of Richard, but they would not like what they found. There is a military search for the remaining of the queen of death, then the villain of the story, a man called Vogel is still looking for the death queen, even seven years later after he came. Vogel alleges that he killed and shot Richard Croft, Lara Croft do not seemed convinced. This is where the story takes off and Lara begins using all her keen physical abilities and her sharp Croft mind, to find the meaning of all this. They managed to find the remains of the death queen Himiko, what they find is a horrible realization that the myth of death of Himiko is based in facts and with the revelation of Himiko´s corpse and her power over death, Vogel and the dark hand organization the Trinity are closer to getting their hands on a new plague, a new bubonic plague that can be weaponize as a biological weapon. Lara Croft must find a way to stop Vogel to bring the new death Queen Himiko´s touch towards modern times. The film is solid entertainment, it had mystery, action, a good charismatic actress who had earned an Academy Award for her ability and talent and she can handle the starring role and manages to carry the film from opening scene towards the end credits.

It has a lot of elements from the games, almost feels like it's a bit too much, but then again that's also sort of how the games are.The writing wasn't great for this, it doesn't really add up. And I also find the acting to be average at best, but that might come down to badly written dialogue as well. I rate it 6/10.---
I just feel there is a bunch of silly stuff going on with the decisions throughout the movie. Mistakes that you wouldn't think an apparent skilled adventure-explorer would make.---
First of all, why would she refuse to inherit her fathers money, because then somehow he wasn't dead? I mean that makes no sense.So she would rather live on the povertyline, barely making ends meet.---
How is it that she can read and understand old japanese scriptures and so on?Being able to read maps, scriptures and solve puzzles.The movie doesn't support any of that.---
Sure we see her train a little with a bow and be decent at it at a younger age, but how does that suddenly make her the most bad-ass jungle-acrobat in the world once she arrives at Yamatai?She is supposedly 21 years old at this point.The only training we see her perform is some MMA and cycling in her adult life.---
Why is it that at least the captain Lu Ren, who knows it is dangerous waters they will travel, doesn't alert anyone of their planned route/destination?And also why don't they seem to bring any supplies what so ever, other than maybe Lara's fathers notebook?---
Why is it that she takes down a guard/henchman, and she doesn't collect anything useful from the body?Maybe at least a knife, maybe a firearm of sorts, cordage or first aid. That would be very logical, especially if you appear to be a skilled survivalist.---
And in the tomb at the end, Lara first of all is the only one that seems to be able to read/solve anything. Which is odd since her father for example has studied this stuff non-stop for atleast a decade.Maybe he could have helped solved the puzzle with the falling floor.And yet she skill would have touched her father even after she knows he is infected and she knows what it does.---
And lastly she at one point runs of in the tomb, without any sort of light source. And still she can find her way around, running full speed like it was broad daylight. I mean she wouldn't have been able to see a damn thing.",Tomb Raider

Still Alicia Vikander plays a brilliant Lara Croft that is a hero in her own right and is not restricted by the typical female hero in film, that being overly sexualised.

What I like about the movie is that it sticks to the feel and experience of the game. Some of the scenes ar shot in a style you will feel exactly as if you are playing the character.

All the other characters are well casted.
Direction is more than decent for an action/suspense flick.
Story is as superficial as it should be(TR is not supposed to be Hamlet)It just works, and I think its perfect as a first introduction to a long series.

With some excellent seeds for future chapters to come !,8,17 July 2019,"I really liked what they did with Lara Croft's character and her entire ""development"". They gave the character depth, complexity and it really builds the (future) forces that we know about her, becoming an ultimate badass,...etc. Because we see her going through a lot of physical or psychological ordeals (even ""tortures""). She grows, learns (the hard way) and walks the path of the hero, all along the adventure presented in the film.A good movie and a worthy introduction to the character and his universe. The tasty point is that it drives to wanna see the direction that it is gonna take, from where it ends. I personally enjoyed the settings, the dynamic way it's shot + its scope ; and also, I've found the lighting of the scenes pretty delightful... 👌 I give it a 8/10. I think it deserves at least around 7. Of course, as always it also depends of the expectations we have and certain people are gonna find it fine and that's it.

It may be that if, despite the cliches you have other movies, the history of the game is already a cliche in hunters and explorers, the problem is that you will not see a video game film that meets the expectations because those already fulfilled the game, basically you see them because you want to relive the game or have fun on a Sunday, so it did not meet all my expectations but it entertained me a lot",Tomb Raider

I would compare this film as Premium Rush meets Indiana Jones. This film presents a great role model old and young women in the character of Lara Croft.

409,hp-33729,Can't relate,3,31 May 2018,"Tomb Raider - I remember this title from my gaming years. I never really got into it, but Lara seemed like a female Indiana Jones character, so a movie with her origin story could be fun, right? Well, it didn't turn out to be so good.My main problem with movie Lara is that I can't relate to her or anything she does, none of it makes any sense to me. Personality wise she's the exact opposite of Indy: empty, wooden, unlikeable and annoying. To be honest I can't really tell if Alicia Wikander did a good job portraying her or it's her fault that the character ended up being like this, but basically she's like a robot with a face devoid of expressions and eyes devoid of emotions all the way through the movie.I already mentioned that none of the things she does make any sense, but that's also true for the rest of the main characters who also have unclear motives and often show inconsistent behavior. This has got to be the dumbest script of any adventure movie I've seen, filled with plot holes and other illogical nonsense that made me utter loud expletives multiple times throughout the movie.I have to say I did enjoy the special effects, some are quite amazing, the director has a pretty good eye for this kind of thing. The acrobatics are great too, although a bit too cartoony for my taste. I'm OK with that though, I just wish the script was good.3/10",Tomb Raider
410,nadeeshantennage,Still enjoyable even through the thinness of the plot.,7,23 June 2018,"This big budget reboot of Lara Croft's adventures could have been much better if the plot and flow had a bit more thickness to it.
Drop dead gorgeous Alicia Vikander shines as Lara Croft eventhough, the flow of the plot and its obvious cliched scenarios don't do much justice to hold the viewer investively by assisting 'the pillar' of Alicia's portrayal of grief stricken entrepreneur's daughter.
Dominic West as Lara's father doesn't have much to do instead of acting so confused throughout the screen time he gets almost making us feel glad about Alicia's portrayal of Lara even with obvious generic characterization.
Daniel Wu as Lu Ren has nothing much to do either but manages to bring a bit of humour and an uncompromised sense of genuine faith towards Lara's ridiculous quest.
Afterall, even with all its issues this film would manage to keep your eyes on the screen throughout the running time and if you are a fan of action/adventure movies keep logics aside and watch the film to enjoy its action sequences and admirable visuals.",Tomb Raider
411,cazmor,Is this the start of new exciting road for Lara Croft?,7,2 March 2019,"This reboot does a lot of things right, unfortunately the story line is a little weak and predictable, with a few tweaks this could be the start of an interesting new Tomb Raider series.The good; our new leading (kickass) lady Virkander was a deft choice for Lara Croft, Virkander shows a depth of acting that was sorely missing in the last films, portraying all the emotions at all the right times, she transforms her character from a one dimensional being into something much more complicated, more relatable and far more enjoyable to watch.With Wu & Goggins also joining in the foray, two exceptional actors in their own right, they cast this film remarkably well. Goggins (Justified) showed his usually exuberance as a likable villain. I did take umbrage with the fact this has been touted a feminist win, surely with Virkander acting so well, it is a win for all movie goers.Roar Uthaug the director, little known outside his native Norway, directed this film very well, limiting the CGI to a bare minimum, keeping the action scenes purely without fuss, which is the highlight of the film. Thankfully he didn't get caught in overly complicated cinematics, which often detracts from the viewing ease.Now for the bad and the ugly; although the acting is multi-dimensional (unusual to say of an action flick), the story was not. Flat, predictable and of a monochromatic scale and speed, it did one function which was got us from the beginning to the end. The Lara Caroft development was helped greatly by the acting, but most characters felt merely an in-fill with little opportunity for the actors to any further than the script.There were also some holywoodized moments of eye rolling, 7 year old camcorder batteries in top condition, plummets from plans with X year old parachutes held by hand, Wolverine paced recovery. Shall we put this down to dramatic licence?All in all, a good Sunday action flick, cast well, acted brilliantly, with engaging action scenes, hopefully a better story in the future and we may have a wining series on our hands.",Tomb Raider

413,bilismit,I could not wait for the movie to end,1,31 May 2018,"If i was to describe how bad this movie was, it would take more effort than it took to make it. Same old boring crap. I mean, why bother with all those traps, all that construction work, why not just burn the body and be done with it. O ye, Lara would not have a tomb to raid. Think about it, someone hired like hundreds of workers, they made like hundreds of same looking stones that form a floor of this one chamber, hundreds of man-hours for hundreds of stones and for what, so that one guy would step on the trigger stone and the whole dam thing would collapse in few seconds! And after all that effort, they just blow up the whole cave. Himiko, can you please just step into the fire? NOOO, make me a damn tomb! I want trap doors and trap floors! But there are hundreds of movies with hundreds of tombs with the same old trap doors and floors! Well, now there are 101. You will see this movie and forget all about it in next 10 minutes, that's how interesting it was.

414,letande,Uwe Boll lives!,1,26 March 2018,"Ladies and gentlemen, Uwe Boll lives. Well, to be honest, I did expect this movie to suck. Just because I remember the times when we used to have real Lara in video games, while this movie is clearly based on that whiny lil' Lara from Square-Enix's reboot (big Square-Enix logo at the beginning of the movie, no proper mention of the CORE team whatsoever). So, I somewhat expected that I won't like the movie. But... while being a huge fan of the original Tomb Raider since 1996, I was unable to resist. And... I must say, I'm surprised. Because it's literally THE most pathetic thing I've seen since Uwe Boll's Alone in the Dark.The problem with this movie isn't modern Lara. Who's stupid, boring and, well, flat. The problem is in the script. New Tomb Raider is a huge pile of the most generic and predictable old stuff you can ever imagine. It's so generic that if it isn't the first movie you're seeing in the genre, you'll want to cry. And probably will. Everything here, every single moment was used in the other movies for like a million times before. Every move, every word. It's THAT bad. I actually can't believe it myself, but it's that bad. It's so generic and predictable that I literally said the next line BEFORE it was told by character many times during the movie. And was shocked that it actually happens every single time. Should I say that it's a complete disaster?But the funniest thing is - aside from some shooting that's done by the guys, who act like they've previously played imperial stormtroopers in Star Wars (those guys in white armor who can't hit anything) before doing this, there's almost no action in this movie. It's just that - generic scenes from the old adventure movies and a lot of cheesy talks. A LOT of them. I really wonder what did they do with those $100.000.000. Somebody must have had hell of a party while the others did a quick job on the movie they didn't really care about. The whole two hours I've waited for the story to start for real. Guess what? It didn't. Even though the movie ends with cliffhanger, I still didn't feel any excitement. Actually, even cliffhanger was laughably boring and predictable. First few minutes of the movie - you can predict what will happen in the end.So... yeah. Not something you'll want to watch willingly. Even if you don't feel the same with me and you did enjoy Square-Enix's videogames, this movie is still no-no. I did mention Uwe Boll at the beginning of this review, but guess what? Old man Uwe actually did better job. Because his movies were so bad that they were actually fun to watch. In a certain unique way, yes, but still. While this one... *sigh* If you want to see a movie and feel that you didn't see anything you didn't see before, then here you go. Want to know most of the lines before characters in a movie actually tell them, even though you didn't see the movie before? Here comes. Want to fall asleep during the movie based on action game? Enjoy. But whatever you do, don't expect this to be a good and interesting movie. Pretty sure that the next movie will include Lara Croft watching the paint drying. And it still will be more fun than this.",Tomb Raider

OK, it's a movie, but c'mon how about a little believability.Lara is a bike courier who practices full contact fighting which she is not very good at, as stated by her coach and loses a bout in practice. Used to practice archery as a child which again showed at the start she is not exceptional in anyway.Never studied archaeology or any other academia. Is rich but refuses the money because of the memory of her father, but pawns the most sentimental thing from her father she owns to, to travel to find her father.Like Kirk, who with no experience on commanding a starship, or Rey without training can use the force like a Jedi Master, Lara is very successful at being a badassed street fighter. Who can handle any firearm and shoots a bow with target arrows that can stop a man in his tracks and who makes no sound when shot. (They must faint or something, the big girls)At least in some Action movies they state, OHH, he used to be a US Seal or British SAS. So you know the guy or girl has had some training. But oh no, all these skills and abilities that come into play are all luck and from birth.Does not the movie producer at some point asks, how does she know how to use an ice pick like that?? Where do they get the finance? Somebody with some sense must have read the script before starting. There is nothing that really redeems this at all. But perhaps my big fear is one of the writers of this non-entity is also penning Captain Marvel.

432,packor,this is the real Tomb Raider,7,24 July 2018,"I never got into Angelina Jolie. When I saw the first ad for the very first movie, I thought ""she does not look like Lara Croft."" I remember watching a scene where she was fighting a swat-like team inside the mansion and it looked like good-looking garbage.This film is true to the game. The rebooted Tomb Raider felt like you were playing a movie. This movie felt like you were watching the game. This Lara actually has a physique which says ""I actually can do what you're seeing me do."" She's jumping around and climbing on deteroriated and crumbling landscapes and coming out with only minor scratches and performing impossible feats in classic tomb raider style. It's unbelievable, but that's exactly like the Lara in all the games.Lara also starts out as a novice, just like in the rebooted game. Out of all the fights in the movie, she actually barely won any of them. She doesn't start using guns. She took a different weapon, and if you followed the movie, it made sense. This movie is unrealistic enough to make Lara Lara, yet realistic enough to believe, and at the same time, the story is decent and transitioned well.This movie could have been better, but there were some dumb ideas in the story, including some freebies given to the hero by the villian much like you'd see in John Wick. On more than one occasion, a villian did not kill a protagonist when they had a clear shot and no reason to let them live. Lara, who's supposed to be smart, somehow thought it was a good idea to chase someone with less mobility off a bridge and fight instead of crossing the bridge and destroying it. She also seemed to believe she can shoot an arrow through an aircraft window. Crazy. Other non-sense things are spread throughout the film, but overall, it was enjoyable. I believe that if they made the next movie where Lara has really become the Tomb Raider, it has the potential to become a classic.",Tomb Raider

434,Micke_Eriksson,"Play the newer games first, then watch this movie!",8,12 October 2021,"Hi folks.I first saw this when it came out, and I was a bit disappointed over how tame miss Croft was.I guess I expected it to be in the same spirit as the previous movies, but I was very mistaken and a bit annoyed and thought this was a dud.However, I recently happened to stumble upon the newer (Around the same time as the release of this movie) games, ""Tomb Raider v1 Game of the Year"", followed by ""Shadow of the Tomb Raider"".Really nice graphics by the way, and make sure to play it with Eyefinity too for a better experience!Anyways, the games actually tells a story about why she's following up on her late father that inexplicably disappeared, presumed dead and sort of why she walked away from the inheritance at first.Also why she didn't have the same fighting skills, accuracy as well as deep knowledge of archeology like the Angelina Jolie's portrayal of lady Croft that we (Well, most anyway) all know to had set the standard.Those movies were good, but also bad at the same time, but mostly based straight off the video game which then had Lady Lara Croft as a cunning and skill-full adventure-fighter-warrior-archeologist.This movie (but also the game, more so even!) however explains how she became this character.Play the game, then revisit this movie and I promise you that your perspective has changed after that.But, most importantly, disregard the first movies prior to watching this reboot!",Tomb Raider
435,SmashandNasty,It's a great kick-off to what we hope will be the newest female-led franchise in film.,7,15 March 2018,"Our take: It's a good action movie if you're into that.
Post credit scene? Extra scene at the very beginning of the credits.This new Tomb Raider franchise reboot introduces a video game movie that everyone, even those who haven't played the game, can watch. Unlike the 20003 Angelina Jolie-led version, it's created for more than just the male gaze. This film excels because it actually gives viewers a plot and character development.They obviously went in a different direction with this film - Vikander delivers a Lara much different from Jolie's; while Jolie was all big guns and sex appeal, Vikander presents vulnerabilities and depth. This results in a film that feels more like Indiana Jones or National Treasure.The movie isn't perfect - the script is weak, the plot is predictable, it gets off to a bit of a slow start, there are bits that are completely unbelievable, but as a whole, it is an enjoyable action film. It's a marked improvement from the 2003 film which was full of plot holes making it confusing and ultimately unsatisfying.It's a great kick-off to what we hope will be the newest female-led franchise in film. It focuses on Lara's early days, and while she is still athletically impressive, she doesn't automatically resort to guns or violence and often has to use her brain to solve the issues in front of her. She's a strong and independent female character who could carry a franchise well into the future.Featuring: An archer only using a realistic amount of arrows.",Tomb Raider
436,HeirOfDorne,Cliche as ever,3,17 March 2018,"Walking into the theater I had very high hopes. After seeing the trailer, I knew that it was going to be based off the video game that released in 2013. Excited about the return of Laura Croft I may have set my standard a bit high. If you have played the video game you will know that it was a very good story, if you haven't I suggest you go watch the cutscenes on YouTube. I will start by praising Alicia Vikander, she is by far the highlight of the movie, and one of the few actors that actually do a good job. Most of the acting is horrible, in part ruined by the cliché predictable dialogue. She is both fierce, vulnerable, and strong. Vikander embodies all emotion extremely well and her character progresses through the film. The athletic ability of this Laura Croft is even more visible than in the previous films. Tomb Raider is jam packed with stunts that would put even Indiana Jones to shame. However, the extra effects and stunts do not save this movie. Along with the lackluster acting from supporting characters, the script focuses too much on developing Laura's backstory, instead of zoning in on this adventure's plot. To again compare it to the video game it is based off, the game has an extended battle between Laura and a main villain Himiko, which isn't even a villain in the film! In summary, this film sacrifices a good plot, which the game had, to develop Laura's character. If you like cliché and predictable action movies than this is for you. I fully expect this to be playing on the Syfy channel within a year and a half. One bright spot of the film was the ending, which does hint that there are more adventures to come. Hopefully next time they can get it right!",Tomb Raider
437,adean81,Better than I thought,6,23 March 2018,"Tomb Raider ReviewWhile I've never played a Tomb Raider video game before, I have heard really good things about the new video games for which this movie is based on. First off I'll start by saying that Oscar winning actress Alicia Vikander is amazing as Lara Croft. She brings a believable physicality to the role as a well as subtle emotions that really make the character feel like a real person. Even though the character is super athletic she is not overpowered. She makes mistakes and has a tough time with some of the action. The difference is that Lara is smart and can figure her way out of trouble.There is some good action in the movie, the best being the scene where she's on the plane. There's also some good action with Lara running around shooting a bow and arrow. I also really liked the side character of Lu Ren played by actor Daniel Wu. I wish the character was more involved in the movie, though. Walton Goggins plays the villain Vogel, and while he gives a good performance the character turns into a cliché villain at the end. I did like Vogel's motives because it is sympathetic, but ultimately the character doesn't hold up. Despite some great action and an awesome lead heroine, there are a few problems with the movie. For a two hour movie, there could have been at least ten minutes cut out of the movie. There are a few pacing issues between the action scenes. The overall plot about the tomb was a little uninteresting and confusing. The ending feels like any other adventure movie but reminds me of the first Resident Evil movie. Overall the new Tomb Raider an enjoyable movie. I really like the character of Lara, she's strong, smart but also vulnerable, which makes her relatable, at least to the female audience. I really like the pairing between Lara Croft and Lu Ren and some of the action is really good. It's not a great action-adventure movie, but there's a lot of good here and lots of potential for future movies. I would love to see Vikander back in the role again, and hope it gets a sequel. If you lower your expectations you may be surprised that is better than you thought.",Tomb Raider

I was satisfied. At first it looked pretty bad, but it didn't take long for it to get better. There was more or less always something going on in the beginning, but as time went on the movie picked up a little more pace and I enjoyed that. Mostly it comes down to the change of location and that is of course the island. The action scenes were great. The story was good too.

Alicia Vikander was great as Lara Croft, and the story kept me entertained throughout. I know a lot of fans of the game won't like the removal of the supernatural element, but I thought it worked well.

447,meneermalik-1,This is like watching someones runthrough of a video game...it's crap!,3,21 July 2018,"What can I say? I guess to the point - this is not entertaining at all. The story line line is so basic that it could be from an 80's 'choose your own adventure' book. Or really just the back story of an Atari 2600 game...almost. The acting is also subpar but I don't blame the actors for that. Poor writing and likely poor directing is the result of the very bland performances. The special effects are sub par also. To be honest, they probably could have made this exact movie when the Original Tomb Raider came out. I would have thought with the advances in cinema that at least there would be some decent stunts, or effects or somethingIn the end this just comes out as a b-movie with a big budget. If this was a game it might actually be decent. Seems like they tried too hard to have this play out as a game than it be a proper movie.

448,lukehasenfus,Relatively Good,7,2 June 2018,"Although it most definitely isn't as good as the video game franchise, I believe this movie is a good time expenditure. The thing that mainly disappoints me, is that the point of Tomb Raider is to be about Lara Croft and her story about how she got there and the troubles she had to go through on the island. Don't get me wrong, they did do that, I just feel that they could have done it better in this movie. 
With the Tomb Raider being such a great video game franchise, I feel that they couldn't put such a masterpiece in perspective in such a small run time. Maybe if they went out for something like a mini-series that was able to have better character build up and plot. 
Overall I think this movie isn't bad at all, but isn't my favorite. I recommend for a movie night of fun.",Tomb Raider

Not the old ones I'm talking the game that came out in 2013 and since then 2 more have come out. While the old games are still cannon these are origins for her. This is where this movie comes to play telling you how she gets turns into who you know. Plus she is more modernized and made to not look so fake or the overly busty style. The old games are great but these new ones are so much better and that's what this movie try's to copy.

The writing is bare-bones and the shot selections get ugly at times but Tomb Raider counterbalances those missteps with moments of emotion and adventure. Driven by Alicia Vikander, who pulls off both swagger and vulnerability, this journey takes time to build its climax and earns its moments. Meanwhile, the variety of action sequences and character interactions throughout contribute to a steady flow of engagement.While this film does fall victim to going overboard with special effects, the steady pace of the journey should warrant viewer investment. Like many broad action movies lately, Tomb Raider tries too hard at times but, it also accomplishes the smaller moments that many of those same action movies are missing.

452,murfit,They dumbed down a video game?!,4,9 August 2018,"Most video game adaptations into movies suffer from the fact that there is often not a whole lot of story and character development in games. The Tomb Raider reboot of 2013 is an example of recent advances in gaming: The makers succeeded in getting away from the more simplistic plots before (not that I didn't enjoy them) to show the development of a young woman growing under dangerous circumstances, and they succeeded in developing and fleshing out their own little island-based mythology, with many scenes and places of eerie atmosphere. None of that made it into the movie.The little pre-story about Lara as a reckless bike messenger is unnecessary and ridiculous. The supporting characters (appearing in the game mainly through cutscenes) were eliminated. The complexity of the island's history and structure and its atmosphere were removed. The mysterious center of everything, the legendary sun queen, was transformed from a powerful witch into a pedestrian disease victim. And the growth of the main character under adversity replaced by ""where are you, daddy?""Boring, uninspired, simplistic script. Decent visuals, OK actors. Watchable, but forgettable. Forget about the puritanical complaints concerning ""objectification"" and just watch the old Angelina Jolie movies - not great art either but at least fun. Even better, play the game.",Tomb Raider

More time should have been budgeted to exotic locations and character development.End result is kind of a movie that is not really bad or good - just boring kind of average.

They did a very nice job of nodding to the fact that it's based on a game, with little puzzles and video game-esque action scenes, all while managing to tell a compelling and emotional story. That's not easy to do! Alacia Vikander does an amazing job as Lara Croft, really tying the film together and delivering a powerful and emotional performance.Sure, it was fairly predictable, but again, it's a Tomb Raider movie. Were you really expecting some kind of critically acclaimed masterpiece that always keeps you on the edge of your seat? Or are you one of those people who were expecting ti feel like you were playing a Tomb Raider game? Video game adaptations are as a rule extremely difficult to pull off. You don't just have to satisfy a regular audience, but you also have to satisfy fans of the games. People form the ladder camp, I feel, often have far to high of expectations for what the experience will be like. You simply can't put an hour's worth of solving a single puzzle in a two hour action movie. Neither can you capture the visceral feeling of playing a game. At the end of the day, games are about the experience. Movies aren't. They're about the story.

The things I liked:
1. The special effects. They looked real and Lara didn't look like some plastic figure jumping and tumbling around and whatnot. She looked like Alicia Vikander, an actual person that has stuff happen to her. Apparently Alicia did some stunts herself so maybe they didn't have to use so much CGI. And she looks very athletic so that adds to the overal feel of Lara being a spunky little adventuress.
2. Alicia as Lara. There's been a lot of talk about her practically nonexistent breasts, and 'of course' the real Lara is quite busty, but I find this talk ridiculous. Alicia looks stunning and sporty, and she oozes Lara Croft from every pore. Her acting was great too, it was very intense and realistic - the emotions and the sounds she made during the fight made it seem like it was all happening for real. You don't usually see it in movies. I wish there was more game-like stuff in the movie, like in the first Tomb Raider movies. I loved Angelina Jolie's Lara doing her training at the manor, for example, and there was more cool ancient stuff going on. In this movie you see more of the kind of stuff you get from the game it was based on. The earlier games were more about riddles, the new ones are about running and fighting, which I personally don't like.
But the movie is entertaining, and I like how it was directed. It seems kinda raw, which the game is as well. This is Lara's initiation. This is what you want to see if you ever imagined yourself being Lara. 
I hope there will be a sequel. I loved the games and as a huge fan I think this movie is pretty well made.",Tomb Raider
465,ladyliliroche,Disappointing,2,23 March 2018,"From watching the trailer, I've noticed that they copied some of the 'action' scenes from the 2013 reboot game. Not a bad thing, but it gave me the impression that the plot will be like the reboot game.After watching the movie, I really wish they actually copied the video game more. They cut out the best part in the game, where Lara actually learned how to survive on her own: she had to kill an animal to eat, make her own fire, navigate the rough terrain, solving puzzle!! PUZZLEEEE!! Tomb Raider always has interesting puzzles and that sense of adventure. There is only one puzzle in this game where they showed the process of solving it, and its lame. The big door puzzle that she solved, we didn't get any clues or information on how she knew which on to turn. And Lara Croft supposed to be an Archeologist, like Indiana Jones. She's interested in myths, ruins, history, that's why she's called the Tomb Raider. Even in the reboot game, at the end, she decided to uncover more myths and history, pushed by her experience at the island.But in this movie, you get the feeling that she's has no interest in myths or history and her only reason to explore the world (for the sequel) is for revenge. If that so, the movie should not be called Tomb Raider... Change it to Revenge Raider maybe?And my biggest pet peeves of this movie were the exact age of when Lara's dad left her. I thought that Lara's dad left here when she's a kid - 7-8? Years old - and yet we got a scene of Teen Lara shooting arrow and having conversation with her dad...Teen Lara only showed up once and her dad only have flashback of Lara when she's a kid... so which is it!!?? The photo on the dad's desk were kid Lara... was teen Lara not good enough for him, is that why no photo of Teen Lara? Or was Teen Lara a dream?? I also wish they made Lara a business woman, or someone that is learning her dad's business, instead of this bike messenger. Have her be a city, posh girl - where she still learned MMA and rock climbing for sport. Show that she's really smart as a business woman and know about world's history and culture.Make the dad a true Archeologist and/or a Museum director that went missing on the expedition to find Himiko. Make that become the reason why Lara hated myths and history, because her dad was obsessed with this myths that caused his death.Make her accepted the death soon and get her to take over the company - like Bruce Wayne (eventually), and one day, she found a clue that her dad might be alive, and she decided to follow that clue, even though it might be fake (as warned by her company member).It'll be such contrast, to see her transform from this posh business woman to the ass kicking Tomb Raider that even she didn't know she has it in her.I can only hope the Uncharted movie will be better than this... more puzzle/ problem solving like Sherlock, adventure like Indiana Jones, and less of the usual shooting the bad and good guy scene.",Tomb Raider

469,johnkampouropoulos,Following the video games,6,24 August 2021,"Even though I am not a gamer, this version of Tomb Raider is more close to the video game reality than its predecessors starring Jolie. Script-wise was pretty obvious, even to someone who has only seen others play the v-game, let alone a gamer. That being said, I wasn't so happy about the script, but it did the job adequately.A lot of good suspense and action scenes, and the film score - which in some cases went further than the very significance of the shots. It was somehow predictable, but not in a disturbing way. And I got the feeling that it was an increase in action, just like a v-game with the next step, and next one, and so on (see my starting comment above). Clever.Alicia is an awesome actor, and I liked the balance between Dom West (Lord R. Croft) and her.There were many goofs though, small bits and pieces here and there throughout the movie which made me say ""wha'?"". Some of them are pointed out in the Goofs section. One thing that I disliked was Lara's ability to fight stronger men, even though she was wounded and exhausted. And this is what I call a ""character description inconsistency""; since the script made her a bit ordinary girl with hidden abilities by choice, since she was aching and screaming when hurt, why made her look like ""oh, I was wounded 5 minutes before? Well- never mind, I'm OK and ready to fight my guts out now"". It seemed like the script writer hadn't made up his mind on what should he focus on.And yes, as Walton Goggins stated, it was a mild mixture of ""Raiders of the Lost Arc"" and ""Goonies"" and ""Indiana Jones and the Holy Grail"". Didn't mind much, but it's kinda obvious in this movie. *Was wondering though if the makers of the Tomb Raider Game had these action movies in mind?*Other than that, It's a nice action film to watch.

481,sarcasm83,An OK flick with a few plain bad scenes,5,17 June 2018,"The movie starts out fairly well and decent, with good direction. 
Vikander seems like a fairly likeable and above all believable (albeit different) Lara Croft... but it quickly goes downhill when Lara gets to the island.She is immediately captured and held captive among a large grouping of people and as such, the movie skips any feeling of isolation on the deserted supposed-to-be-mysterious island. The island doesn't become a ""character in itself"" unlike it does in the (also fairly recently rebooted) Tomb Raider game that the movie takes influence from. She does escape and the movie then hits a few notes directly from the game in question, but somehow those scenes feel tacked on.. Especially Lara's shock and remorse on her first kill is handled even worse than in the videogame, as the next day, she's already taking lives with zero hesitation and not even being shocked when an enemy soldier literally explodes to bits in front of her.The plot regarding the crypt of Himiko was ok and I think it was handled well... a part of me would've been curious to seeing some supernatural elements in the movie aswell, but they kept it more anchored to real life and it was fine - but a few scenes in particular were so bad that I couldn't help but get genuinely annoyed...First one was when Lara's father had ran in front of the crypt's entrance during the fight when Lara is freeing up the people from their captives.... The father just stood there with his mouth open, touching the entrance stones etc. until he was held at gunpoint by the baddie and Lara had to intervene etc. It's as if they didn't have any clever way of moving the plot forward to that point, so they just made the father go there and wait among all their enemies for the inevitable capture.The second absolutely idiotic scene was near the end, when Lara leaves her father, grabs the climbing pick and runs towards the main badguy... When she arrives at the chasm the baddie is about to cross it, balancing on the ladder between it... Instead of attacking him when his back is turned, with the pick, she THROWS THE PICK AWAY on the ground, jumps PAST the bad guy to hang on the ladder, pulls herself up, forces him back to the platform she just came from (and left the pick on), only for him to obviously pick up the pickaxe and overpower her with it. She only gets up from under him because of an explosion and then, she could easily run across the chasm and drop the ladder, trapping the badguy behind, but nope, she kicks the ladder down trapping herself AND him there.Sure, it did serve a purpose to give us a last fight or whatever, but when the movie is supposed to portray a smart, capable character like Lara Croft, seeing something like that just makes you frown...Either way, it wasn't an entirely bad movie and is worth a watch on a boring day, but I wouldn't recommend it if you're in the mood for a genuinely good watch.",Tomb Raider

I had high hopes for Alicia Vikander as I think she is a great actress, but an action heroine she is not.Nothing in this film works. The opening scene with the bikers in the shared London flat was unbelievably cringe. Don't watch this film, unless you want a huge slice of disappointment.",Tomb Raider
483,troestrup,Great to be surprised by the beginnings of Lara Croft,10,28 April 2018,"As I am listening to the beautiful soundtracks of the movie right now, I will note down some key aspects, I found really interesting.
This cinematic experience turned out to be the best entertainment, I have watched this year so far. Also, it was just what I needed:
To sit down in a comfortable (but not too comfortable, as if to fall asleep) chair in the cinema and not just watch a movie, but actually to become immersed in it. It might be important to note that I have watched a lot of other dull movies and tv shows lately, which all has merely entered my brain, just to zone out of it again a few days (or even hours later).
But this movie was truly different! (It may have helped the experience that I had had a couple of cups of coffee before, but hey, it was so worth it). From the first second of the movie I was captivated (by a fantastic introduction, which I havn´t noticed done that way in many movies lately). After this the movie had to paint a picture of Lara´s young and unexperienced character, which seemed a bit odd and slow to me, because I did not get at this point that I was about to explore Lara becoming Lara, if that makes any sense (see the movie to understand). I guess, I had hoped for a more hardcore and rough Lara like she is in the older movies or the video games, but as the movie progressed, I came to eat my own thoughts. Especially after a scene, showing her being trapped on a wrecked plane wing that is about to crash into the depths of a giant waterfall, I was forced to the edge of my seat by the so rarily-experienced-these-days movie magic.
Another little detail I was wishing for the entire duration of the movie was that Lara would find her two guns somewhere, whether it'd be from some dead guys or on a counter (the bow was awesome as well though too, but I have only played Tomb Raider 2 (almost antique game), where I don´t believe you can obtain a bow), and what do you know, at the end after the final title of the movie, marking the end of this epicosity of a movie, she walks in a... somewhere and... well, you gotta see the movie now!
I also loved the detail that she gets a ponytail at the end too, thus the transformation into Lara Croft is complete.
I will probably change my rating to nine or ten in a few weeks, when the movie will still be in my head, and therefore I will know that it had an impact on me, which for me is a reason to rate it accordingly.",Tomb Raider
484,samratmitrafeb14,Can it beat the original Tomb Raider movies with Angelina? Nope!,5,3 April 2018,"We have played plenty of Tomb Raider games in our time and the only actress who comes close to depicting Lara Croft is Angelina Jolie. Alicia Vikander could be her dainty sidekick but attempting to rewrite the series with an actress who does not even remotely appear physically strong as Angelina did is a travesty of sorts.
The relationship of father and daughter between Jon Voight and Angelina was a strong subplot within the original movies, something the current installment lacks completely.
Alicia Vikander is a good actress otherwise but this role requires a lot more than acting skills and that is where she fails to convince as a 'Tomb Raider'!",Tomb Raider
485,andreasz-2381,"Not bad, not good.",6,24 March 2018,"First half starts very interesting. To see and follow the young Lara til her first adventure. Second half is somewhat disappointing, except of one two scenes. Why? In my opinion one of the reason was the antagonist Vogel acted by Goggins. Second, a team on a small island, almost 10 years, blow everything to hell to find the entrance to realize the team need Lara to solve the puzzle which open the gateway because the team can blow it to hell for some reason. Third, the deplaced music for additional tension.So, Alicia´s excellents performence saved the whole movie!",Tomb Raider

The majority of the people who enjoy this film the most likely would never write a review here. From what I can tell, the target audience is about 12 of all genders. Its intended to be an enjoyable teen adventure movie, as the games were first intended.Unfortunately for the reputation of this movie and those who made it, the generation who enjoyed the game series grew up into adults. However, this particular movie did not make the jump. Call it a ""Reverse South Park.""I honestly almost fell to sleep at a few parts. I did enjoy the acting of the ship Captain she works with. I see potential for him and some of the other actors. It stands alone well as a good teen/kids action movie, not quite G. Some of the actors like Daniel Wu. I would love to see Daniel Wu in more American films.So as a 32 year old, its a 5 for me. However, I see the 7 in it for a younger audience. Enjoy if this appropriates you.",Tomb Raider
487,janetwilkinson,A little Meh,2,2 June 2018,"The Things They Got Right :1. The Vulnerability of Lara : This was well done, and gave her character and realistic attributes. When she got hurt you knew because she expressed pain. When she didn't know what to do she expressed that. If we had left it to the feminist brigade at Hollywood none of that would of happened. Bullets would have been rebounding off her skin and she would of been killing mercilessly.Things They Got Wrong :1. You know a film has run in to a lot of trouble when they have placed a female character in a fight and they have to resort to tired and quite frankly sexist tropes. They nearly made it through this film before they too fell to the same mistakes. Lara isn't capable of beating a woman her own size. Yet when she ends up fighting men twice her size she manages to win every single time. When she can't, they resort to the petty ""kick them in the balls"" cliches which just get on my nerves I don't mind if everyone is getting their genitals attacked but when it only happens to one gender it irritates me and presents a very clear double standard.",Tomb Raider

493,AustinSober,'Tomb Raider' Review: A Surprising Find,7,19 May 2018,"Movies based on video games are something that I'm surprised Hollywood continues to try. First attempts in the early 90s barely followed the source material. As time went on, they proceeded to try harder, but still, the films only followed the source maybe 50% or so and often failed to give characters much depth beyond their one-dimensional game counterparts. (I give some credit to the first Hitman and Max Payne though). In 2016, Hollywood tried again with two big releases: ""Warcraft"" and ""Assassin's Creed."" The former wasn't really good and the latter was merely decent, but yet again both failed to critics, audiences, and box office returns. They fully embraced their respective games' styles and source materials, but once again they didn't provide good characters and both basically alienated anyone not in tune with games already. Now, here comes ""Tomb Raider"" leaping into theaters based on the excellent 2013 reboot of the game series. A good source material like that should make for a good movie, but everyone is naturally skeptical of course. Luckily, I bare positive feedback. Quite positive.""Tomb Raider"" successful breaks the bad video game movie curse with a solid action thriller propelled by a well-crafted lead and a story backed by some real emotional connections, making for good entertainment for both video game fans and those looking for an adventure film that stands on its own. It may be the best video game film to date.The plot revolves around Lara Croft, an orphan who desperately wants to know what happened to her father that disappeared 7 years prior on a mission to stop a terrorist group from locating a cursed tomb on an island hidden off Japan's coast. It manages to follow the game's plot close and the yet change much at the same time. Much of this change is for the better as a film. That change is the father/daughter dynamic between Lara and her missing father. This was absent from the game which relied more on the player's control for the character to create the relatability. The filmmakers wisely understood the need to change this since a film is a third person, observational experience. I was worried that this dynamic would hurt the film, however, since it has been done time and time before (even the first Tomb Raider attempt with Jolie back in 2001), but surprisingly it all worked better than expected and even went a route I didn't anticipate.The character of Croft is expertly handled by Alicia Vikander. She manages to create a charming strong female lead that doesn't resort to making her aggressively unlikable (hello Katniss from ""Hunger Games"") or like some superhero that is good at everything (hello Rey from ""Star Wars""). She is strong, but venerable. She is a little cocky, but not snobby. Plus, she realistically has no real knowledge of surviving a deserted island or an army of marooned, desperate mercenaries. She is a believable hero.The action is well staged with some scenes are that manage to be just as thrilling as they are great to look at. The pacing is spot on, never making for a dull moment. The film's style is more realistic and grounded in nature than most video game translations, outside of the occasional backbreaking moment of anti-physics. However, those moments are true to the game so it's not a complaint. Tomb Raider games are known for their mythical elements and the film manages to find a clever way to balance mysticism and gritty reality very well.There are still some hiccups I have. The villains are played out well for the most part, but they could have been fleshed out more. Walton Goggins does a good job as he usually does at playing the head baddie, who does have a realistic anchor to crimes (marooned on an island by a terrorist cell away from his family). However, his group ""Trinity"" doesn't really have much presence. They are just sort of necessary antagonists that could have had more development given to them. It doesn't help that we really never see the real leaders of this secret Illuminati-like group throughout the film. Another issue is the sequel bait ending. I am getting really tired of this occurring in everything. This is the first film, therefore you should just make a film with a clear-cut beginning, middle, and end. Setting up another film at the end doesn't justify you making another one. You earn that right if A) you make a good film and B) it makes bank. You succeeded on the first, but don't take bets on the latter. It's frustrating, but not because of the groan of more. It's actually the fear that we may not even get a sequel to this because of everyone still being crazy over ""Black Panther"" (it's seriously time to move on from that now).I want another ""Tomb Raider"" film. Whether that will happen is unknown. What is known is that they have set up a good foundation with this one if they are able to. Alicia Vikander is Lara Croft through and through and it would be nice to see her character go further. The truly great thing about this film is that it works on its own. You don't need to play the game to like it. The fan service is there, but not in your face. Everything is explained well (as an adventure story, the film benefits from having exposition feel necessary to the plot). This awakens the possibility of many good video game films to come....hopefully that is. ""Tomb Raider"" is the first time I can truly say without hesitation that it is actually a really good movie that happens to be based on a video game. It's no masterpiece, but in the video game genre, it may as well be one compared to the competition.Recommended.",Tomb Raider

495,nikolaiv85,Bad story,3,10 January 2021,"This is a bad version of first game of reboot. While the game story is showing us development of character, that is not the same with the movie. I didn't like supernatural things in the game, and only reason why I give 3 stars is changing that part of story. About Lara's father survival, i think that is the most stupid thing which could happen. On one island a lot of trained people for years didn't find the archeologist they need. He succeded to fake own death, which is quite opposite with organization reputation. They kniw everything everywhere but here - they ate stupid. Also, in game they were corrupted survivors, because they were forced to stsy on it., here they are paramilitary organization with slaves. But, there are some other things which I don't like. Lack of original crew of Endurance. Lu like a character. He is sloppy written. But mostly, Lara. Was she an adult when he disappered in this story? Probably not. Is she that stupid to not finance her own search for father by signimg that papers? In this story yes. While I love Lara from reboot from 2013, even if she is not a very clever girl, this Lara is much worse than her. Also, there is one more reason why I dislike this movie, thst is it had impact on reboot trilogy. I really like the original model of reboot. This actress is ok, but her model in two last games of trilogy is bad. While I think that Rise of Tomb Raider and Shadow of Tomb Raider ate not good stories, this plot is destroying development from a scaried little rich girl to the girl who is prepared to fight, which is a good development of story and character.",Tomb Raider

Her first 'kill' of another human being was a visceral and emotional event. The story was very good, the action outstanding, the effects almost excellent and the pace never lets up.

The problem is that the story line is very poorly built and executed. There's absolutely no character development, with some characters showing up only once on screen with no consequence for Lara's life, and no understanding about their more intimate motivations. The mystery aspect of the story is just there as an almost ignored prop - the riddles, the symbols, the whole investigation surrounding the secrets about Himiko are just there in the background.

501,deceiver-1,Best Tomb Raider Yet,8,16 March 2018,"Okay, I do about three reviews a year. Many seem polarized about liking or disliking this movie. I really liked it. My star rating of 8 indicates very good. Anything 8ish, is in that range to me.I enjoyed the Angelina Raiders. But, admit it, they were movie versions of the video games. Cartoon turned real life movie. Fantasy premises, practicing on yet to be made sparring robots. Mystical scenarios where parts of a triangle had to be assembled when the planets aligned to give the barer god like powers.This Tomb Raider was different. A real believable person. She obtains her skills in kick boxing practice in a city gym and practicing archery as a young girl. She bleeds, gets hurt, and the best thing is that she's smaller and not as strong as the brutes she fights, but this Lara still barely wins with skills she learned and also gets a beating in the process. More like what might happen if this had actually taken place. Think about how many times you've seen a 110 pound girl hit a 250 pound square jawed thug and sent him head over heels as if he were made of styrofoam and be asked to believe it. Also the final saving of the world from disaster isn't based on a mystical premise but an actual, plausible, science based scenario. Enough said about that. No spoilers.She wears cargo pants, a t-shirt that isn't stretched out from her anatomy, and doesn't smile with joy after she gets her ass kicked. (remember Jolie?)The bottom line. Great heroin, a good story, and more believable action sequences based on actual physics and biology. You become one with her in her quest because she's in the real world.Highly recommended.

506,Shred_Master,Decent movie but not as good as I hoped,7,17 March 2018,"Some people may think of Tomb Raider as the classic video game gal and the Angelina Jolie movies. Then, when this movie was announced, many of them said, ""why oh why are they remaking this?"" Well, what the more obtuse may not realize is, the games were rebooted, quite well with the recent Tomb Raider and Rise of the Tomb Raider. The better of the 2 games is the first one, which the movie pretty much follows, where Lara Croft is stranded on an island and must unlock the mystery of why so many have perished trying to escape.They really nailed Lara Croft's role with Alicia Vikander. Of course, this again is keeping in mind the recent game reboot. She is joined by some movie veterans, Like Dominic West and Walton Goggins, both who also don't disappoint.The problems start in the first act, where Croft is rebellious and does things that get her into trouble, while also having no knowledge of archaeology at all. She is good with a bow and arrow, athletic and good at running and escaping tight situations, as well as solving puzzles, which is how she ends up holding her own on the island but I was a bit disappointed that she didn't possess the know how off the bat. The dialogue was a bit cheesy and there was way too much buildup before getting to the island. If you've only got about 2 hours of movie to show Lara being Lara, you don't need to show over a quarter of it with her not really being Lara.She finally gets to the island and it starts to really feel like the game. She is kidnapped right away by the main baddie, only to escape and have to survive a not quite as harsh environment as the game but you do have your white rapids, rusty airplane falling apart under her and parachute that manages to open but sends her flying into the trees, causing a debilitating injury. It would have been nice to see her really turn into the survivor we know from the game, hunting for food, building campfires, finding shelter and building her arsenal. I guess though, since they spent so much time getting her to the island and she had the showdown with the main baddie to get to, with only so much time left in the movie, they had to hurry and skip over some details. Big difference between playing a game for days and seeing a 2 hour movie but there still could have been more there.The supernatural element involving the tomb everyone is trying to get to ends up being disappointing as well. Maybe I'm drawing too much comparison to the game but let's face it, that was their source material and they seemed to cherry pick some things to include and omit a whole lot more. Ideally, this would have been a 2 parter, with her getting to the island, being stranded and becoming the true Lara Croft with survival instincts and becoming an all around badass, with the second movie dealing with the bad guys and the tomb but I understand that would have been a lot to ask from Hollywood.In the end, I did find the action to be enjoyable and the performances were solid. It just fell short as a true adaptation of what they were trying to portray and while a lot of it had to do with what they were confined to as far as time, decisions could have been made to expand on more of what fans of the game really want to see.",Tomb Raider
507,ChrisChadwick,An Almost Realistic Lara Croft,6,16 March 2018,"I loved how they didn't bring external politics into this film and instead had an intelligent, brave woman as the protagonist who is limited by her physique when it comes to combat against men. It's getting tiring watching small women kick men's arses. It takes you out of the film. If you're going to have a female role model, make the character believably formidable and give the actress a chance to inspire people (and by people, I don't just mean little girls. Female role models should be able to inspire all demographics, including men). As for the film, I found it a little plodding and aimless at times, but Vikander did her very best, albeit in a miscast role (imho), but I liked that she wasn't a Superhuman Mary Sue pseudo-male and that the plot and action was 90-95% believable.",Tomb Raider

At one point she stands right out in the open aiming a bow while a bunch of fellas fire automatic rifles at her and nothing happens. She's literally a sitting target for like 15 seconds and nothing comes close to hitting her. Theres absolutely no tension whatsoever. The story is dull, the script is terrible and it feels like nobody wants to be there. There were parts I actually cringed watching. Even for a video game movie this was bad.

511,ruchirpathak_it21,Nice timepass,7,2 January 2019,"Watched the latest reboot of TOMB RAIDER starring Alicia Vikander. I haven't watched the original Tomb Raider movies starring Angelina Jolie. But in itself this movie is a good timepass, with enough events going on to grip the audience. Alicia did well as Lara Croft. As per the story Lara's father is lost and she found a clue about his father and about an old lore, which if disvovered can cause harm to the world. Now its Lara's turn to stop the evil forces to get their hands on that long lost evil lore. The action, special effects are good, and it gave the feel of treasure movies like Indiana Jones & National Treasure. I rate 3.5/5",Tomb Raider

2nd part - ""Rambo (2008)"" where Lara Croft joins a group of lost fishermen kidnapped by the ruthless infantry unit in the isolated island to venture into war to rescue her father.

Mathias is there tho, which is good. Though his mission is completely wrong as he kind of need Sam to do what he's supposed to do. But since Himiko isn't the sun queen, but an infectious rotting pile of bones, he(Mathias) really don't have a reason to be on Yamatai in the first place?
There are no storm guards, and no giant rotten Japanese soldiers. The only thing they did make right was the boat, The Endurance, but the boat belongs to a Japanese local, which is wrong.
Richard Croft got killed by trinity in the Croft Mansion when Lara was a little girl, so what he is doing in Yamatai is a huge question.But, the movie is good, and there are elements from the 2013 game that you as a player may recognize.

I don't know the new game upon this movie is supposed to be based.Now I don't understand the hate about this new Tomb Raider. Yes, the story is cliche and cheesy. What did you expect? What is the first thing coming to your mind when you hear ""Lara Croft"" if not action sequences and crazy stunts?I saw a review somewhere saying ""It is as entertaining as watching a loading screen"". Although not true, I can understand why this was said.
It takes a lot of time to get to the point. That's a bad thing. But other than that I enjoyed it along with its cliches and flaws. You can't make a better movie based on a video game. We all know this. So to wrap it up, it is not the perfect movie that will be in your personal Top 10. It is a good movie that can entertain you for two hours, so it serves its purpose. Go and watch it.",Tomb Raider
516,factoidjunkie,Finally a Lara Croft I can admire,9,17 March 2018,"Never played the game, so comparisons of the movie to the game are unimportant to me. For many, this first sentence already tells you I am not a qualified reviewer. For many others, you come from the same viewpoint.Tomb Raider movies are action packed, make believe throwbacks to archeological puzzle solving adventures. Different time periods inject different bends to the story - social consciousness, suspicion of evil moneyed classes, and the level of gratuitous violence one must face. In Tomb Raider's case, there's also the extra layer of parental/child relationship. This movie was far more enjoyable as an example of this genre than the prior films. It focuses on contemporary feminists issues without giving way to body forms or sexuality as THE issue, rather than an issue. Having a female character of strength that knows how to fight and knows when to run is refreshing. If this does reboot this franchise, I hope the directors maintain this more realistic approach (in an unrealistic movie). Leave the James Bond comparisons for Atomic Blonde. Let Tomb Raider be an adventurer, not a self-declared spy.Vikander excels at the determined young woman coming of age against a dark strain of life. Her physicality is believable. Her attitude towards her father more realistic. Her change of mind more credible.Dominic West, unfortunately, is directed to play a rather sad, cardboard version. It is almost as if he represents the 1930s genre character, while Vikander represents a 2018 version. If intended it worked. If not, then the director needs better advisors.If this kind of film appeals to you, you will enjoy this film, despite it's already lamented weak points. Have some popcorn and enjoy.",Tomb Raider
517,blueclementinex,a masterpiece... for a movie based on a video game,5,11 March 2018,"To start off my review, i'm not that much of a big fan of the tomb raider games. i only played parts of the 2013 video game and i must say i enjoyed it. when i first heard this movie got developed, i am pretty excited but also have my doubts. to avoid disappointment, i didn't watch any of the trailers and just walked into the movie knowing nothing but alicia vikander is attached to the project. and after watching it, i must say it's not disappointing yet not great either.First thing i'm going to talk about is the good things about this movie. i love the character lara croft is potrayed. even though it' not a thing you never seen before, it still has eur63273830lements of reality into it. like how unexperienced she is and how she's still learning to be better. i love every minutes nick frost came on to the screen, and i also like that scene where lara croft is for the first time is using her bow and arrow and wits to sneak into the camp. even though the scene has flaws, i still found it entertaining since it has the elements of the game into it. and it's fun how they tackle into those element well enough. okay that's over now i'm going to rant about the things i don't like about this movie.It's very uninspired and nothing new. my main problem is the script. i think the story is just so bland and clichéd you could basically give it another tittle or not attach it to the tomb raider franchise and it wouldn't make any difference. you could basically know how everything will turn out. i even could know the next move the character is planning just because how lazilly it's written. the ending is just so predictable i roll my eyes when they act as if it's like a big reveal and the audience are supossed to be shocked. it has many clichéd dialogue as well. the CGI is horrible at times. this movie is very inconsistent in my opinion. at parts it looked gorgeous and at parts it looked very horrible and digital. the score is common and again, you could put it into another movie and it wouldn't make any difference. other character than lara is lazily written, they're just a one-dimensional character who doesn't have any development. their motivation is very common, and i bet the writer who wrote the movie basically just wrote the most common thing the audience could felt sympathetic for.
my biggest disappointment is how annoyingly unused the character of Lu Ren. like, he's barely even there! and it's so promising at first. he just kind of randomly show up and everytime the movie cuts back to him it felt out of place. he could have a good backstory and motivation to actually appear and have real role in the story. it's what i thought he would be. sadly, he's just another person who helps lara in the background 
and the last thing i want to rant about is alicia vikander. she looks gorgeous, i tell you that. but she's not a good action actress yet a great drama actress. she has this exagarated, loud grunts in her action scenes that bothers me. you could defend her by saying it's realistic and everything but seriously i don't think it's as important so that at some point it's everything you could hear. but, again, to my point at the dramatic scenes she stands up well and potray her character and its development well enough.
in conclusion, it's not a great movie, but for a movie that is based on a video game this is one of the best. thought, it might not the best compliment since that bar is set very low.",Tomb Raider
518,DirectorSam,Stays true to the games,4,13 April 2018,Tomb Raider isn't a great film by any stretch. However I was entertained for the run time. Alicia Vikander carries this film that makes it enjoyable. Without her it's below average.,Tomb Raider
519,barcham_99,"A 6 for Alicia, a 4 for the rest",6,9 December 2018,"This finally came around on my movie channel last night so we sat down and watched it. I have no idea how closely this follows the recent game release so I'm reviewing this as a stand alone movie only.It started off decently with the 'Fox run' idea to introduce the character and explain why she was working as a bike courier. But that idea, rehashed from Dark Angel was only a sign of things to come, one stolen idea after another.They steal from King Kong with the mysterious island surrounded with impenetrable rock shoals and Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade by bringing a diary back to the enemies and following a list of instructions to get through a booby trapped cavern. And the easily predictable 'revelation' at the end as to who her real enemy is was right out of more movies and comic books than I can be bothered to list.It lacked all the fun of the Angelina versions, especially the first which remains, IMHO, the best video game movie ever made. It is very obvious they expected this to kick off a new franchise by making it a from scratch origin film but I doubt there will be any demand at all for a sequel. I have no interest in another hero fighting against her own family's evil corporation.And I'm not bothering to get into the many ridiculous things like the ship being crewed by only one man with Lara's help, who should lack even the slightest idea of how to help pilot a ship. What was the point of the restaurant at the beginning with the young man who was afraid to ask her out?It's worth a watch for Alicia Vikander fans and for Tomb Raider die hards, but you would be better served by watching the original Tomb Raider followed by Last Crusade and then playing your favourite game version.",Tomb Raider

The caracthers make some pretty dumb decisions and the plot is way too convenient a lot of times. Besides this the temple part is really nice but overall the caracthers or the story didn't appealed to me.,Tomb Raider
522,arthur_nonimus,"Better than what was, worse than what could be",7,20 March 2018,"Spoilers contained within, but only for those in the know.I was worried when I walked into the theatre, the bad reviews had been really bad, the good reviews had been only okay and great reviews had been unbelievable. Having been a long time fan of the games since before the original Jolie garbage I really hoped that this new movie would atone for the, how should I put this, 'crimes against humanity' of 2001. After having seen it though, I'm left with a mix of emotions.The movie takes as it's base the two new rebooted games - Tomb Raider and Rise of the Tomb Raider. In this they have tried to stay true to the spirit of the story of games. It would be a disservice to say they didn't do a great job in this regard. Those looking for a blow by blow retelling have and will be disappointed. However having said that, this new offering is not perfect.Quite possibly the worst is with the big bad. The main antagonist 'Mathias' was overcooked, going from a larger than life ever present threat to weak thug with a gun hiding behind hired muscle. But this is not a fault of the actor - this steamer lands directly at the feet of the director. In one scene he shoots a sick man and then points the gun at Lara, holds then walks away. What are we supposed to think he's powerful? That he's unstable? It doesn't play as anything other than 'thug', having him hold the gun sideways and flashing a gang sign wouldn't be out of place.Second is Lara, and again this brown river is delivered express to the Director! At first Lara comes across as a bit of a spoilt princess. Not totally out of character for the games but not a good fit either. Then after a short time on the island she transforms into Rambo with a bow. What made the games so compelling was slow progression. From Lara's first kill to save her own life, through escaping from burning rape and pillage parties to her going on the offensive the games slowly show her growing from college brat to Tomb Raider. The movie has none of this progression. After a life or death fight Lara runs through the bush after someone from her past. A short time later she's a practised killer and stealth artist. Does not compute!!Finally, there are the minor gripes. The loss of Jonah, the intro of supports that are bland in backstory at best, the change of Himiko from powerful warlord to victim of disease. And the throwing away of important story lines. In the game Himiko's spirit creates the storms which strand all on the island. Lara's Past (see above) mentions this precisely once, but nothing more is made of it. It could have been used with the story they had, providing a solid base for Trinity and a sequal! Instead the decision was made to throw this away.This new addition has made up for the problems with the originals, but is far from the greatness it could have been! Don't believe the ultra negative reviews, it's not perfect or even great but it is worth the price of admission.",Tomb Raider
523,thethomasboy,Ignore the uninformed or confused Users - this is Lara's Casino Royale.,6,4 June 2018,"I don't know what the other user Reviews were thinking/watching. Anyone complaining about a ""Mary Sue"" or bad CGI must be referring to the 2001 films, people whining about massive plot-holes weren't paying attention, viewers expecting twin guns must not be familiar with the new source material... And any reviews referring to her as ""Laura"" can be dismissed outright.The best analogy would be the recent (and well-received), James Bond re-fresh. During the Brosnan era, the character became formulaic, relying on stylish but increasingly absurd situations and over-the-top set-pieces that became stale -- and with his perfect luck, limitless abilities, and clear invincibility Bond grew even more un-relatable and thus uninteresting (aka boring). Enter the Craig era with Casino Royale (2006), a Bond ""refresh."" By grounding the character in reality, stripping away his experience, and following on his first mission, the boundaries and stakes are reset -- add in the focus on his character growth, his relation to others, and displaying vulnerability, he becomes interesting and accessible (aka not boring). While not quite the bullseye Casino Royale was, Tomb Raider still hits close to this mark (and not every film can afford a Paul Haggis' script).For those unfamiliar with the source material, Eidos has produced nearly 20 Tomb Raider games in as many years. When Square Enix acquired Eidos in 2009, the beloved character was in danger of Bond-like self parody. So in 2013 they released ""Tomb Raider,"" a soft reboot which served as both prequel and origin for Lara Croft. The invulnerable, glossy, perfect-breasted Mary Sue was replaced by a flawed-but-fearless heroine, at the heart of a gritty, survivalist journey (think The Revenant (2015)).Warner Bros. opted for substance over style for this Tomb Raider, drawing from the 2013 refresh and Alicia Verkander encapsulates the new Lara perfectly. Not just with looks or accent, but in capturing her fierce sense of independence, which also masks her fear and naiveté. She creates a raw tangibility to the character not seen before, as she overcomes insurmountable odds not with backflips, bungees, and butlers - but with her intellect, determination, and sheer will.Norwegian director Roar Uthaug (The Wave (2015) and Escape (2012)), has experience and skill at the ""man vs. nature"" conflict, and builds a world that is both beautifully fantastic, harrowing, and realistic. No techno soundtracks. No goofy stunts. No wire-harness-assisted triple backflips. He manages a rapid pace with escalating stakes, while delivering some strong character moments to simultaneously build Lara up while breaking her down to her essence. It is as much a coming-of-age film as an adventure, which may explain its somewhat ruminant and sullen tone at times.Ultimately this film pays a typical price for its gritty realism, missing a lot of the humor and light-hearted fun that turns simple Adventure films into classics. Or perhaps Uthaug clung too closely to the source material, forgetting to replace any fun 'lost' by not playing the game yourself. Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981) showed us the balance between exciting set-pieces, character, realism, and pure fun. And while Tomb Raider isn't a woeful trudge, my hope is they dial down the dour and turn up the fun for the next installment... Because its a strong start and our best shot at another great Adventure franchise, (at least until Uncharted).",Tomb Raider

To be honest i was brain dead from the beginning. Why is lara croft an uber driver? What the hellNothing here keeping to the roots of the game or the history of the character. This is Nearly 2 hours long however nothing happens until 1hr 48 mins and even then your left wondering what uv just witnessed. The story is non existent. The characters are shallow/dumb and non progressive. Lara herself isnt bad but its like ALL the effort went into her and nothing else mattered.Even the ending was embarrassing. A pathetic attempt at a plot twist was ridiculously predictableThe only good part was the very last scene which had some mild humour and a touch of the 'old school' Lara which i quite liked. All in all yea your never gona win oscars for appearing in movies that are from games however you do expect entertainment. This was neither. It was trying to hard and even failed at that. 1 star.

526,laura_e_dillon,Solid 7- Coming from a huge Tomb Raider fan (been a fan for 20 years),10,1 June 2018,"First off I am a fan of Tomb Raider and have played almost every game since TR1. Honestly IMDB should be removing a lot of these ridiculous low reviews. Anything below a 5 is just completely unfair for this movie. The movie is nowhere near bad, I think a lot of people are just too invested in what they think the movie should be like and because its not perfect they give it an unfair low ranking. All the whining about it being unrealistic with her bow and everything is very similar to the game! Lara often used a bow in the reboot which is very unrealistic yet that wasn't such an issue for the game. All video games are super unrealistic. You can take thousands of bullets in the video game and not die lol. This movie is far more realistic than the game so I don't understand all the whining about realism. Most of the story elements for the tomb raider games haven't really been that great and I think the story in this surpasses the games. A lot of money went into this movie and it shows. The story and cast are solid and believable. Sure Lara doesn't really look like the Lara we all love from the games, and I agree that she is way too skinny and the film lacked some of the charm of the past Lara Croft films. Angelina Jolie fit perfectly as the iconic Lara. However as an origin story Alicia does well and has room to grow into the classic Lara. Alicia is enjoyable to watch and the story flows super smoothly. I think people have a hard time just enjoying a good movie. Some people prefer to only complain and nitpick. I love how this is set up for a sequel and I hope they continue to make movies of the same quality and caliber as this one. I think the next tomb raider movie has potential to far surpass this first film if they continue in the direction they are hinting. I just hope they allow her character to be a bit more charming as well as feminine and sexy because thats Lara. It would be nice if they allow her to put on a bit more weight so she can have some curves because in this movie she is just so skinny plus the saggy pants makes her look like she has no bum at all. Lara should never be wearing saggy diaper pants. Lara is classy and I hope they can build on that as she matures in her character.",Tomb Raider

Since I also played the fantastic reboot I expected the storyline and a different Lara. The only harsh cut was after her first kill. There was too less time in the movie that covered her guilty feelings and switched too fast to Tomb Raider the killing machine. Beside that you are going to see a tombs, traps, some unlogical decisions but over all a clear recommendation.Beside the story I think Alicia played an excellent Lara Croft.

531,tempestnyx,An Adaptation Worthy of a Franchise,8,3 May 2018,"Oh, video game adaptations, always such a challenge, and yet, this adaptation does the game justice while also not being a complete copy and utilizing the material they have before him to weave out a film that can spin out a series.Tomb Raider is an exciting film that follows Lara Croft on her very first adventure. Young and naive, Lara begins the film with very little in her pocket, refusing to accept her inheritance on the note of her fathers ""death,"" she takes random jobs and lives paycheck to paycheck, remembering her father. However, then, with the company at risk, if she does not accept her inheritance, she stumbles onto a clue and a mystery connected to her father's disappearance.The story uses the concept of the first game while also tying it to the second game, creating a more realistic story that strays away from the fantastical element of the game, creating an action-packed and grounded story. The fantastical is gone, which might upset fans of the game, but for a film that is trying to reach a mass audience, the realistic way of the film that focuses more on defining Lara Croft as a character for the film; a character viewers around the world can understand.Tomb Raider is a film that is action-packed and fast-paced. It moves quickly, while not losing the character development in the film. Lara starts off the film naïve, but by the end, she is stronger for the loss, stronger for the way the events open her eyes. Let's not forget Alicia Vikander's performance. Her performance is incredibly different from Angelia Jolie, who was already playing an experienced adventurer. She is a young woman who has not begun to discover her calling in her life, the adventure that drove her father heart, has yet to capture hers. Vikander brings the character to life wonderfully, highlighting everything that makes her strong and vulnerable. Vikander commands the screen with her elegance and spunk, capturing the essence of Lara Croft, Tomb Raider.The film moves quickly, it focuses on the story, on building a backstory and leaving an open-ended ending that leaves room for a sequel. It is entertaining and uses elements of Rise of the Tomb Raider to give this film an extra edge that works well for a franchise.",Tomb Raider

The question is How? She didn't train for it and looked as a fighter but in the time of need she fought as a pro. How?
She didn't complete her schooling or any training her father had put her in. But in time of need she got super powers of her ancestors. Their knowledge, their fighting skill and others. I quote her father ""You are 10 times better then me in all sense""I feel that the producers and the developers just wanted to make money out of the reputation of the old movies and the brand name of Lara Croft.

547,mukool-hastak,"Good start, not great, but leaves hope for a better sequel",8,9 March 2018,"Disclaimer:
This review is slightly biased to be positive since i am a fan of the games and i went into this movie wanting it to be good.From a game-fan's perspective:
This movie may not completely shake-off the curse of video game movies but it takes a big step in that direction. I'm very conflicted as i say this because if you've played the games, you will inevitably compare the movie to the games. The problem with that is that a game takes 20 hours to immerse you in the narrative while the movie only gets 2. Once again, i find myself coming out of a movie which could have immensely benefited from an extra 20 or 30 minutes of storytelling and world building. All that said, this movie is far superior to other video game adaptations we have come across so far. The movie stays as true as it can to the source material which is largely the 2013 game, which is one of the main reasons i enjoyed watching it. Every now and then you'll find yourself going ""aaah"" as you remember a move that you made in the game being played out expertly by Vikander on screen.From a non-gamer movie-goer's perspective:
You will no doubt get an Indiana Jones kind of feeling. Young girl chasing myths and legends on an island jungle while being chased by bad guys. It offers well-executed action set pieces, a solid if not entirely thrilling story, a good serving of emotional moments and a pinch of humour here and there. Alicia Vikander's fans will be treated to another great performance.Pros:
Starts off superbly. We get a 15-minute taste of what Lara's life was like when she was just another renegade young girl making a life for herself in London, before she went off adventuring. And this helps a lot to connect with her character, in a way games may not. The story flows seamlessly from her life from London streets to the start of her adventure, with exposure to her father's backstory coming at regular intervals. It feels authentic and helps the viewer connect with Lara (which has for so long been a problem with other video game movies).Cons:
The third act feels....cautious. The writing and screenplay could have been far more ambitious. They could have delved into the supernatural aspect a bit more. The antagonist could have been given a better ending. (As i said before, another 20 mins could have enabled his well). However they set up potential sequels quite well. The bit at the end where she dresses up like classic Lara with the 2 guns would have been very cool had it not been spoiled by the trailers. Apart from Vikander, the other performances felt mediocre. Walton Goggins was good but could have been much more menacing.TL,DR: It's good, could have been better. Sticks close to the 2013 game, and emulates it well on screen. Story is solid if not thought provoking. Vikander does a great job. Hopefully we will get a better sequel. Definitely worth one watch at least, just for the fun of it.",Tomb Raider
548,RMBittner-777-930003,Play the Game,4,1 September 2018,"I loved the 2013 video game they claim to have used as the basis for this movie. But other than a character name or two and the names Himiko and Yamatai, virtually none of the story remains. Which is a shame, because the game is terrific and the movie lacks both interesting characters and drama. (It only starts to feel like ""Tomb Raider"" at the 65-minute mark!) Almost nothing is explained. In addition, the filmmakers somehow got approval to rewrite established Croft history...but to little point. If you really want a great story, play the game. Vikander is fantastic, however.",Tomb Raider
549,MaxHuskins,"Another victim of the ""Video Game Movie"" curse.",4,22 March 2018,"I knew this was gonna be a terrible reboot as soon as I saw the trailer but boy, was I in for a treat.First of all, it boggles my mind as onto how this movie got financed with 94 Million Dollars and got handed to people with barely any experience. Thankfully it's flopping at the box office so we won't see a sequel but whoever is using this project as means of money laundering still got their cash back. Tomb Raider made a pathetic 28Mil domestic and a total of 133Mil worldwide as of this moment.Now let's move onto the movie itself. The writers and creators of this project had dozens of ""Tomb Raider"" games to seek inspiration from as well as millions of myths and legends from all around the globe, they picked the weakest concept to be converted into a movie. They chose the 2013 Tomb Raider relaunch of the game series, which focuses on a young Lara Croft going out into the world for the first time and becoming the legend that she is. NOBODY want's to see this as a movie, (I'm assuming) most of us who saw the movie are familiar with the game lore to at least a minimal extent. The developers of the game had to start fresh and make a new Lara without outrage, this movie didn't have to worry about that. Audiences wanted two hours of an epic action-adventure set in exotic locales, following the story of the most badass female hero in the world. Instead, we got to sit through an excruciating and cringy two-hour drama about a whiny, entitled, dumb ""teenager"" who is repeatedly humiliated at every single task that she attempts on her quest to find and save her daddy. It's not ""relatable"", it's just bad and sad. Personally, the casting of Alicia Vikander was the first disappointment while the movie was still in production. Why not use Camilla Luddington who the new Lara Croft is based on, played by and voiced by? Why go for a C-List actress in hopes of a higher box-office? Those choices are beyond me. Alicia's Lara reminds me of Kristen Stewart's performance of Bella in the ""Twilight"" series - lifeless, bland and annoying. Perhaps, it's just the horrendous writing and she's a good actress, I honestly can't tell, however I know for a fact there is lots of wasted potential in this movie. Take Walton Goggins for example, fantastic performance in The Hateful Eight, sub-par performance in Tomb Raider, however, I don't think the script gave the actors much to work with, no room to act or express themselves/their characters in this adaptation.Literally, everything about the writing in this movie is depressingly bad, characters often speak their motivations, emotions and plot exposition through the blandest, most boring, unnatural dialogue you can possibly imagine. This movie feels like it was written by somebody who's never written a movie before. Oh wait, Geneva Robertson-Dworet who wrote this movie has never worked on a single other movie before. Shocking, I know! You know what's more shocking? She's set to write Marvel's first female-led superhero film ""Captain Marvel"", as well as ""Sherlock Holmes 3"" and the upcoming live-action adaptation of ""Dungeons & Dragons"". I pray to the studio executives and the ""big mouse"" that they take those movies away from her because they will be a train-wreck otherwise. The other contributing writer of this movie, Alastair Siddons is almost equally inexperienced with 1 movie behind their belt (which sits at a 27% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes).If you've ever though some movie checks off every single cliche and trope of its genre, whatever movie you have in mind has a new competitor. Tomb Raider is one of the most painfully predictable movies to a point of hilarity. Literally, I was laughing my entire way through this film because it follows it's own formula beat by beat leaving nothing behind. I would honestly say it's as bad but also equally entertaining as ""Suicide Squad"". To be fair, I would assume that most average moviegoers who are programmed to enjoy their mindless entertainment made by a formula won't even notice anything off and shrug it off as a ""decent"" movie. However, if you have any amount self-respect and prior knowledge of films, I think it's safe to say this will be a great new addition to your ""so bad it's good"" collection of movies.Moving on from that, the action is honestly as boring and predictable as the writing, with some of the best scenes being lifted directly, frame-by-frame from the 2013 video-game. The fighting choreography is equally ""meh"". The cinematography is also not this movies strong suit, nor are the special effects or acting or production design or anything really. In fact, the movie consists of maybe about 15 minutes of tomb raiding, meaning if you cut this movie down by about an hour and a half, it would make a perfect short film. Also, most importantly, even though nobody wants to see an origin story, that being the crucial part of this movie and it's plot, I'm afraid to say it fails on that promise and there is absolutely no character development at all. Maybe with the exception of cheesy lines such as ""You messed with the wrong Croft"" and ""I guess I'm not that kind of Croft"" and Croft this and Croft that and ""I'll take two guns please"". Get it? It's a reference for nerds like you! This movie beats it's gaming audience in the head with pointless Easter eggs and makes sure to point them out and scream about it as if we're all dumb babies.My conclusion is that even ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" was significantly better and had its moments unlike the 2018 adaptation of ""Tomb Raider"". So, if you like learning from ""bad Hollywood"" or just want to have mindless fun or maybe need to fall asleep on a flight, this movie is for you. If you're a fan of the ""Tomb Raider"" franchise, be it the games or the movie franchise starring Angelina Jolie, you'll be severely disappointed. If you're a fan of the action-adventure genre and want a thrilling escape from reality, desperately trying to scratch that itch, wanting to feel the way you did when you watched movies like ""Indiana Jones"", ""The Mummy"" (original trilogy), ""National Treasure"" or even ""Sahara"" then once again, prepare for disappointment.",Tomb Raider

She is weak and wooden and dull as Lara Croft, and unfortunately can't hold a candle to Jolie, who was magnificent, exciting, charming, captivating and perfect in the role.The storyline is also lacking - a spoiled crybaby daughter looks for her Dad.

You are MUCH better off watching the classic Indy flicks. Much better off.
I don´t know what Hollywood is thinking, if there is even any thinking involved, but it seems they either underestimate their audience, or still make enough money by serving up this kind of lazy crap.

Now, who was better for the job? Lara Croft of course, obviously. Curses are her thing, and this film nailed it by proving so.This film focuses on the rebooted games of the Tomb Raider game series (2013-present), specifically the first one. It's not the exact same plot and climax, but they do share similarities of setting and stunts.The acting, the narrative, the sound score, the stunts, the editing, the cinematics, and overall feel of the film is impressive and very well done.

This one is wild and loose, and feels like Alicia is really taking a beating. I like the story line and the acting. Angie's appeal carried the first 2 movies which seemed like that was all the creators were banking on. Alicia held her own as Lara, it had a much more real feel to it, and she's fast and athletic.

In this movie Lara is a whining little girl who gets her @ss handed over to her more times than i could possibly count in this movie. A girl that even starts crying, yes you heard that one right.
But that's not the really bad thing about this movie, Vikander's acting is. Crying at one moment, 1 second later trying to play it a bad@ss and 1 second after that again getting beaten up by someone. She got an Oscar and that tells me just how low the Oscars have reached in recent years.
Scenario is not much better either, they tried to make this a lot like the game (solving puzzles) but due to her less than good acting and the bad scenario it just seems that she already has all the answers ready without even thinking for a moment.The ONLY reason i am giving this a 5 is because in the end she gets the dual guns we've known her to use (well ok she used desert eagles back in the day but those would be way too large for her i guess) so she MAY become a bad@ss in later movies.

575,Nebbuless,Tomb Raider & Friends,1,1 June 2018,"Clearly the Angelina Jolie movies inspired this film more than the new video game series did, leaving the writers lost in some kind of gray area. Also lost in this purgatory between the two, is Alicia Vikander, who trained way too hard for this movie to try too little.This thing is a goner after the MMA match opener that the crew seemingly spent all of their time and attention on, soon followed by Lara Croft playing capture the flag on a bicycle with a paint bucket. Then we're treated to a boy her age unable to ask her out on a date (which seems built up to pay off at the end but never does)? I guess this was all from the part of the script they forgot to delete.Tomb Raider (the new video game series) starts off simply. She's on a ship to an unknown island she seeks to explore. It capsizes and she's thrust into this world of danger and intrigue on the island she was destined to. The plot fills itself in organically via a series of flashbacks and other interactions by the characters shipwrecked with her, as she progresses onward.This movie throws away all of that beauty and simplicity by over complicating her background which could easily be explained over the course of the movie. She doesn't even make it to the island until maybe 40 minutes in. We're beat over the head with her father's simple first draft exposition (and that never ends until he's dead towards the end of the movie).The pros are the very few and far in between action scenes of Lara surviving the onslaught of the environment and antagonists at hand. Not to mention how well Alicia Vikander and Walton Goggins do with this turd.If you like video games and have a PS4 or an Xbox One, skip this movie altogether and pick up some copies of Tomb Raider (2013) and Rise of the Tomb Raider (2015).",Tomb Raider

But it failed to do that. The plot was so weak that even I felt boring in second half of the movie.
Roar Uthaug forced emotions into the movie and made the plot weak.
Dominic West's work really loved it but his character didn't needed that much of build up and all. 
Even the action sequences are also less compared to the game.
I have only one opinion if the movie was made according to the game to some extent say 60% then this would've been the greatest in Tomb Raider series.

591,lizzieprince,Much better than the original,7,27 July 2018,"I watched this not expecting much, I found the original too much of a boy's wet dream. I love this new Lara Croft, more of a feminist action hero than a male fantasy. Yes, it was predictable and copied elements of the Lost Ark, but it's great to see arse kicking female lead and I really enjoyed this film. Also, Wayne Goggins makes a superb villain! I'm looking forward to the next one...",Tomb Raider
592,krisdimoski,The start of an exciting journey?,8,24 March 2018,"Let me start by saying that this was the perfect family action/adventure movie. If you go watch this movie bring your kids along because they will love it. Alicia Vikander turned out to be the perfect casting choice for the already well known heroine Lara Croft. She gave such a fresh performance and basically brought the series back to life on the big screens. The story is a great intro for whats following. I love how this one compared to the Angelina Jolie's series is way more down to earth. I was really pleasantly surprised by the villain played by Walton Goggins, he really delivered and could definitely see him doing big things in Hollywood. The only thing that annoyed me was the actor who played Lara's father. The only reason why i am giving this 8/10 is because i just couldn't take his character seriously.All in all I am really excited about the future of this series! 
Go check it out if you haven't already, you wont regret it!",Tomb Raider
593,billhoward-65533,A nicely paced film version of the video game,7,1 June 2018,"This is clearly the pilot for what is hoped to be a successful new Tomb Raider franchise and Alicia Vikander makes an effective Lara Croft. She certainly looks the part - her body shape almost identical to the game's Lara - with a couple of notable exceptions. The pace of the film, use of tools, weapons and sets faithfully reflect the game. OK - so some of the dialogue is cringe-worthy, but there are plenty of much worse films out there and for fans of the game, this should not disappoint.",Tomb Raider
594,ello-03383,Great acting,7,11 October 2021,"I didn't particularly like the plot, but the acting is great. Alicia Wikander is just amazing. It's a good movie, would recommend it for someone who is really into action etc. But personally I wouldn't watch it again.",Tomb Raider
595,davidjemitus,Not Tomb Raider,4,24 June 2020,"The Angelina Jolie versions paid homage to the origin in computer games but the new film does not - the name is Lara Croft but really the film looks like a second rate action movie that has been adapted to include just enough from Tomb Raider to barely pass as based on Tomb Raider.Alicia Vikander puts in a good performance and copes well with the action scenes and the other actors work hard but it's the story that is the problem - it is dull and empty.
Lara's father is very badly written - at times sickeningly soppy and other times angry without meaningful reason.
A big disappointment.",Tomb Raider
596,Pedro_MiguelC,Disappointing,5,2 November 2021,"Lack of emotion, it seems that the producers already knew it was going to be a mediocre film. The script is basic the villain seems to come straight from a movie for children . At least Alicia Vikander struggles in acting and the action scenes are well directed.",Tomb Raider
597,adnarish,"Enjoyable, but misses a few marks",7,20 July 2018,"This film is a nice fit for the recent Tomb Raider games that trace Lara Croft's development from a young woman to the fierce and violent gun-toting adventurer the world knows from the original Tomb Raider games (and films).The story is loosely based on the story of the 2013 game, but makes various changes to stay within the time limits of a film. That they've also cut back on some of the more outlandish and supernatural elements of the games works well - although we'll still see Lara suffer in ways that would no doubt be fatal. Given that one such case drew a lot of criticism after the release of the 2013 game, it's odd to see it included in this film. That Lara goes from panicked self-defence to cold-blooded murder in the span of a couple of minutes, another issue with the games, is also carried over into the film. A missed opportunity to show character change!The CGI work was convincing, if not always equally so. The music never takes centre stage, and adheres too strictly to convention as it attempts to set the mood for certain scenes. The actors did a fine job - Dominic West is his usual convincing self as Richard Croft (his role here is much larger than in the game, which really wasn't needed), Walton Goggins makes a pretty 2D character somewhat sympathetic by conveying his frustrations in a convincing manner, Daniel Wu has a great screen presence and could easily have taking over the role Dominic West was given in the second half of the story, and it was good fun to see Hannah John-Kamen in a small role.Alicia Vikander did a commendable job as Lara Croft, putting up with a huge amount of physical challenges. I've read she insisted on doing a lot of her own stunt work, and that's to be applauded - especially given the amount of it! Vikander is a good match for the younger Lara Croft, and there's little to criticise here. There's just one glaring issue: her accent. In the recent games, British actress Camilla Luddington is the voice of Lara - and Vikander can't really keep up in this department, even working a number of Americanisms into her delivery. It's not necessarily bad, but it's unfortunate - and noticeable. Something to work on for a possible sequel!All in all, this is a fun two hour film about a Lara Croft just starting out in the Tomb Raiding business. Fans of the games and adventurous ladies in general will find enough to enjoy.",Tomb Raider
598,Ahmed-ASG,"Hollywood tried in this one ,, not so bad",7,29 September 2018,"Gotta say this one wasn't disappointing , i'm glad it was something refreshing in the right way , this is my first time seeing ALICIA VIKANDER performance , she's one heck of an actress , looking forward to see more of her work , oh and Dominic West my goodness , finally playing a good guy ^_^ , he's one of the most enjoyable actors to watch performing in cinema and it was very cool to see him get out of the villainous spots for once.lastly , OMG why there's so much hate for this movie ?? i don't understand",Tomb Raider

600,megadethdragoncrimson,"Finally, the movie that breaks the long dreaded Video Game Film curse",10,7 March 2018,"My thoughts on Tomb Raider starting Alicia Vikander, Daniel Wu, Dominic West, Walter Goggins and Hannah John-Kamen.Wow!! Finally a video game movie that is so much fun & exciting as well as crafted beautifully. Overall, a solid story with great action and some surprises I wasn't expecting. Alicia Vikander crushed it as Lara CroftVikander is the new queen of Action films!
I was so impressed by her performance throughout the course of this film.The entire cast was solid. The film definitely has an Indiana Jones vibe which I think is epic!! I spotted some nods to the original games.The film is very well grounded and gritty. The action sequences and visuals are stunning. Definitely brought the 2013 version of Tomb Raider to life with a bang. Vikander's Lara Croft is a hero that is flawed yet keeps pushing forward and you see that in Vikander's performance.While Warcraft and Assassin's Creed stumbled, Tomb Raider rises above the pack with superb storytelling, great action and impressive performances.Junkie XL did a phenomenal job with Tomb Raider film score. So epic!! Thank you Roar Uthaug for bringing this film to life in spectacular fashion including Walter Goggins, Daniel WI and Alicia Vikander, Thank You for this amazing film! Proud to be a long time #TombRaider fan.Go see #TombRaider!
Some of plot elements are predictable and cliche as is the case in many action films but there's plenty of twists and excitement along with the stellar cast performance and action sequences to make this a must see!",Tomb Raider
601,itai-orion,Tepid and nervous adptation leads to mediocre result.,6,2 July 2018,"In 2013, the gaming world was granted a worthy successor and reboot to the Tomb Raider property. This re-imagining of Lara Croft allowed the player to feel her growth and progress, gaining skills and confidence. Even at her most vulnerable, this character is charismatic, knowledgeable and courageous. Fast-forward to 2018, and a similar reboot attempted to do the same to the film franchise, to invigorate the action-adventure legacy of Indiana Jones, to allow for an action movie with a strong female hero to take the audience to the realm of wonder and awe.If only it had lived up to the hype and expectation... Unfortunately and for reasons unknown, instead of doing a straight adaptation to the powerful story conveyed in the game on which it is based, the screenwriters veered away from the super(natural) elements of the plot and filled in the holes with cliched and overdone movie themes - the missing parent, the bland villain, the comic-relief sidekick whose only purpose is to allow the hero to further the plot.... Certain scenes in the film have been adapted directly from the game, but without the involvement and control inherent in an active medium (as in the game), we are left watching the world's dullest playthrough of that incredible gaming experience.Alicia Vikander embodies Lara Croft as the reboot games envisions her. She brings power and confidence exactly as the role demands. Her early moments in the film's urban setting are the most exciting. Strange that in a movie featuring the Japanese goddess of Death, the most exciting action sequence is a bike race. After a weak opening voice-over, our main character is revealed in all her talent, only to be gutted as the movie moves on.If you come to this movie expecting a silly action flick, you will be disappointed. If you come expecting a supernatural adventure, you will be disappointed. If you want to see a fantastic video game with cinematic gameplay translated to the screen, no luck either.I do not know who this film was made for, but I think it played it safe to a fault - supplying us with a forgettable and dull film featuring a weakened heroine who is constantly saved by plot convenience and rarely relying on skill.",Tomb Raider
602,DesolationGod,"Pretty good action Flick, well acted",6,1 June 2018,"Some of these negative reviews are hysterical especially the ones about plot holes(just an fyi, every movie in existence has plot holes)..Anyway Overall this was a pretty good movie, I thought Alicia played Lara pretty well, the story was not bad, tho I kinda felt they moved on from her first kill too quickly, i mean one moment shes an innocent girl racing her bike through the streets, the next shes killing people left and right like the classic tomb raider. But aside from that the plot wasnt bad, I did not notice any overly glaring plot holes that would detract from the film,The effects were fairly good and about what you would expect for a film like this.Overall I would definitely recommend watching this if you enjoy the tomb raider universe, for a reboot it was pretty good. 6/10",Tomb Raider

605,Amritz101,Alicia's Great,7,18 October 2018,"Overall this is your average action movie.But, Alicia Vikander on the other hand is an amazing action star; what a revelation! I love it when Hollywood casts an actor like Alicia in an action role who has the physique/physicality, can believably pull off the action role and perform parts or most of the stunts like running/fighting which results in seamless action scenes between star and stunt double so there's no need for shaky cam or SFX (unlike scarlet johanssen's lame natasha romanoff/BW).

609,after-hour_dvd_collector,An average movie that can't hold a candle to the video game,5,12 April 2018,"Though I'm not an avid gamer, I did actually play through the 2013 video game this movie reboot seems to be based on. I'm saying ""seems to be"", because while there are action bits and pieces that do seem to come straight from the game, the overall story is too by-the-numbers and watered down, something the game (quite impressively penned by Rihanna Pratchett, daughter of the late Terry ""Discworld"" Pratchett) managed to avoid.The movie follows young Lara on her first quest (after some introductory parts that neither make much sense in context nor explain anything beyond the most basic motivation of the characters and seem to last half of the movie but were actually much shorter ... go figure), and of course things go awry as soon as the search for her missing father starts; she falls from one danger into the next and ends up on an island together with an ill-written corporate evildoer with a motivation of ""because"". We get some more action - some straight from the game - and a sudden leap in Lara's expertise over the course of half a day that's neither explained nor in any way well written, and some Bruce Willis commemorative moments of ""falling from high places, getting impaled, then getting better because of the power of stitches"".What we don't get from this movie is anything that made the game so great: the twists, the turns, the huge vistas, the claustrophobic caves, the constant sense of danger and urgency, the struggle against overwhelming odds; instead, it's just one Indiana Jones flashback after the other (minus anything supernatural) with actors who could do so much better had they been given anything in the script to work with. Instead they need to act out dated old scenes and pick choice straws from a hat that only contains the variations ""dumb"" and ""more dumb"".I had hopes this would be good, mainly because the 2013 video game did so many things right and had truly memorable scenes (ugh ... just remembering the climb up the antenna still creeps me out) but this movie ... is just not good. It's average popcorn at best. I'm giving it an undeserved 5/10 and that's possibly nostalgia talking here. For a game just five years old.",Tomb Raider

The movie progressed so slow, too many drawn out scenes that added nothing to the plot. Characters that made silly decisions, horrible acting on some parts. The cinematography was not good, it felt like a made for TV movie rather than a blockbuster movie.

Alicia Vikander in the leading role was spontaneous. Though I am not satisfied with Dominic West. Someone older and more mature would have been a perfect fit.The beginning of the movie was nice, nothing extra-ordinary. The cinematography throughout the movie was great. The middle part was kind of boring. But boy oh boy! The ending really hit me hard.I am glad the main part of the movie not supernatural. Especially this quote-

How hard is it to find someone who looks like Lara Croft, either versions of Lara new or old, Alicia Vikander does not do Lara Croft any justice at all.
The CG is just pathetic what else can i say, there are youtubers that can do a better job.
The story is just pathetically boring, i tried to put the whole CG is crap and she looks nothing like Lara aside, but seriously the plot was just plain crappy.

619,simonmassey76,Takes a ridiculous plot too seriously,5,18 January 2019,"By no means as bad as the Jolie films, this opts for a slightly different tack and tries to treat the material in a deadly serious way. Vikander makes for a great Croft and, like the recently rebooted games, they have tried to ground the character and make her much more relatable than the previous films. That being said, by opting to change the tone completely, it makes for an increasing ridiculous film which is hard to take seriously as the plot develops. It doesn't help that the finale seems almost to have been ripped from Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. A more balanced approach and lighter touch throughout might have helped enormously and whilst Goggins tries to ham it up a little as the chief villain, the film hasn't done enough to make its audience invest in the characters.",Tomb Raider
620,MikaHaeli8,Had an absolute blast,7,19 March 2018,"Went in with low expectations, came out pleasantly surprised. The pacing was uneven, the dialogue was often clichéd, it took a weird turn near the end, and it was surprisingly gruesome for a 12-rated film. On the other hand, some of the actuon and chase sequences were great - there's very little shaky-cam and there aren't 12,747,727 cuts, so you can follow what was going on. It was funny at times, and Alicia Vikander did a great job as Lara Croft. Best thing of all: she wasn't sexualised at all, and there's no romantic arc. Also, she's very much an (athletic) everywoman who undergoes decent development throughout the film. To those who complain about her being infalliable: that is a key feature, if not the ONLY feature, if 99% of male action protagonists. I don't see you complain about that.Anyway, this film was fun to watch. Whilst it's not worth rushing out to see, it's definitely worth paying for.",Tomb Raider

They mixed up all elements of different games (specially the saga's reboot Tomb Raider of 2013), they even got Richard Croft dead, alive and again dead (what the heck, just let the man be dead), something I haven't seen in the past two games or the previous three before the reboot. Lara doesn't even know how to use a gun, she gets a bow and for no reason runs trough the jungle trying to get faster (?) to Vogel...The color was horrible. The dialogue, awful. Lara gets emotions out of nowhere. But the cherry to the top of the cake was the final 15 minutes: Crofts owned a company that they were fighting against?

I will never watch another action movie with a woman in the lead role - it might keep the neo-marxists and soy-boys happy, but I live in the real world.I gave up when she brought out the bow to take on 20 trained men.Acting good, special effects good, writing cliched, propaganda maxed-out.",Tomb Raider

Note that I have clocked over a 100hours with the Square Enix' 2013 reboot of the game with character of Croft portrayed by Camilla Luddington. This 2018 film wrote itself around the story-arc of said game, squashed it into a 2 hour movie and did a nice job going about it with a simpler mutation of the story structure as a result. Or was it? See spoiler section for more. Alicia Vikander's performance uplifted the show although she wouldn't have been my first pick for the actress playing Croft, my brain gradually ignored her complete and utter lack of bodily fat (I mean a little fat here and there would have been appropriate, innocent and naive according to Croft in the game), eventually I succumbed to her pretty face and the rest was history. I gave action sequences 8, goofy dialogues 6, story 5 and Alicia Vikander 9. See spoiler section for more.***SPOILERS START HERE*** 
The ending for Tomb Raider 2018 felt cheap, cut short and left several questioning doubts in my mind. 
1. Why oh why? Is Himiko coming back to life a matter of CGI too expensive for you? Damn it! 
2. And ""Why would you entomb a world-threatening dump (INTENDED TO NEVER AGAIN BE DISCOVERED) in a beautifully dug tunnel sealed with sophisticated entrance, riddled with deadly traps, carved out painted pictorial stone walls -and- colorful gummy-bear puzzles so enticing for the curious (or sugar loving) people to find?""

The whole burn everything about Himiko, like he couldn't do that before he left. By the way, damn nice batteries in the video camera seven years later. Ruining the Himiko story by making her Typhoid Mary instead of sticking with the much better story from the game. And the predictable paint-by-numbers plot. I pointed out so many things before they happened that I'm surprised my wife didn't think I was clairvoyant! At one part my wife asked 'Did she leave the gun behind?'(A lot of movies do that one....please just stop). And the woman at the table when she went to sign the papers, she's a villain? What?!

630,chameleon-81660,After an excellent video game Lara reboot here is the excellent movie Lara reboot.,9,15 March 2018,"If you wanted a terminator Lara Croft with big boobs and pistols, go and just play old Lara video games.For those who are not following the video games here a little history. Several years ago the game maker studio behind the Tomb Raider series decided to reboot. They changed the character in every way. They thought that the gamers need another type of Lara and a upgraded gameplay. They were right, the first reboot video game (2013) became a perfection (over 95% positive review at the most popular video game provider application) and now we waiting for the third game release.This film follows the same. we have a new Lara. This Lara is also determined, brave and agile, but not the terminator one before 2010. She can be hurt in every way (physical and mental), can be afraid and she is much more likely can be an inspiration, because she is not too far from any normal people. 
Alicia plays perfectly this kind of Lara, every feelings, every action are authentic.
The story starts little slowly but its ok. Those who claim that the story is the same as the 2013 video game, they lying.The cinematography is flawless, the atmosphere is awesome and soundtrack is well chosen.
Someone says the villain character is boring, what i say is perfect. After 7 years searching for a tomb in a middle of nowhere, i would be moody too. Even the villain mention few times the he came out of practice of social skills.So i would recommend the film: Anyone who played the reboot Tomb Raider games and for those who think they can accept a new Lara Croft which differs a lot from Angelina Jolie played Lara Croft.",Tomb Raider
631,tydawg,"The best video game movie so far, but that's not saying much...",7,4 April 2018,"Tomb Raider was a fun surprise that had a few hiccups in the road. To start, Alicia Vikander(probably spelled wrong) was amazing in her role of Lara Croft, giving a gripping preformence that is a lot less skimpy of the other films. That said, the acting was very cheesy and the whole tomb plot towards the end of the movie could be somewhat confusing to people who have never played the video games. But, put that aside and watch this if your looking for a good thrill ride.",Tomb Raider
632,alanlovoe,Very good action / adventure movie,7,2 September 2018,"First I would like to start saying I am a fan of Tomb Raider since the first game (with the squary polygon Lara) and I'm also fan of the action adventure films that goes with the Indiana Jones / conspirancy plots.That being said I want to move away from the comparison from the game. This is a movie guys, not a game and it's not to entertain only the fan base but to be watched by EVERYONE.. gamer or not.... that's why it's called adaptation. If i wanted a stick to the game plot I would just either play the game or watch a full game walkthrough in youtube.All that being clarified and being fair to be movie adaptation on its own. Alicia makes an excellent job portraying Lara, i really don't like to compare with Angelina because it was a different type of movie and different times (standards and people change over time like with music). Alicia makes a wonderful job engaging in the story.As for the plot itself i believe it was good to keep it simply even when that may pose it as dull, just because I think it was much better to make the character development and introduction.
The plot is not surprising but it remains truthful to this movie genre, if i compare it to Indy Jones movies or similar movies it stays truth. I agree that it may not have all the action or swings in the plot as you could expect but towards the end of the movie it became clear why. They built the whole plot with the premise of making sequels.. which to me is good and bad... good because if well executed it could create an awesome franchise... bad because it does not shine in the first act as it should in a self contained movie... so in this Franchise looking industry this is becoming common.Also the plot kept things as realistic as possible which I really like, because it make it more watchable... having super natural sourcery taking to the big screen alwawys risks to make the movie look childish. In this case they make a very good job keep in it real (as much as possible in a film like this).All and all i think the movie is very good as for a revamping of Tomb Raider and a very good movie for the genre as a whole. If you like action / adventure movies this is a must watch.If you are a game fan just try to low your fan expectations to a movie expectation and try to get your mindset in ""movies are for entertaining everyone not just you and your game friends"" and maybe you'll enjoy it.",Tomb Raider

I feel like they didn't care enough about gamers, and they wanted to reach a broader audience by pushing stuff away. Mainstream and little risk equals more money in your pockets? You miscalculated here. If you want to do a Tomb Raider movie, do it like the video game. (with some supernatural stuff, all the characters, etc.) If you want to do an Assassin's Creed movie, do it like the video game. (most of the time is spent inside the Animus, a historical context)You had everything right there, all the inspiration, great action sequences - just in front of your eyes in-the-game. Now I know it's not the same and might be hard to adapt all the materials, although... my conclusion is this: you made an action/adventure movie, but unfortunately it is not Tomb Raider.",Tomb Raider
636,CynicAce,Didn't expect it to be a GOOD Movie,8,10 March 2018,"First of all I didn't expect this movie to be good but this movie is Definitely good, Great Cinematography, Acting, Story, everything is great. Even though I haven't played any of the Tomb Raider games, this movie is good itself.Let's start first with the characters. at first I thought Alicia Vikander won't nail it as Lara Croft, but I was wrong, She is great in the film. Her acting was great. She did a great performance and the whole cast did great. She may be a little bit skinny but she is brave and fierce in the movie.the character development of her is great but the supporting actor who helped him to find her father in the movie didn't developed that much.the fighting scenes are great, they're still there and Alicia Vikander proves that she can do it, that she can do stunts which is great. the action sequences are visually stunningThe movie is a 2 hour film but for me it's still a little bit fast paced, the story is good though, there might be some flaws, might be a little weak but it's still good. Even though i don't play games that much, I'd say this is the first Good movie based off of a video game.a good movie, I recommend everyone to watch it, specially if you're a big fan of The Tomb Raider games. 7.5/10",Tomb Raider
637,Luap79,"A step, leap and barrel roll in the right direction...",9,19 June 2018,"I bought my first PlayStation (one) when they were released for about AUD$900.00, give or take and the first installment of Tomb Raider not too long after. 
I have played every game edition and seen the original movies starring Angelina Joley. As much as I like Angelina in many other films, she just didn't do it for me as Lara Croft. 
OK, she had the body depicted in the original games (the ones prior to the 2013 release), but she didn't have the nous and passion that Lara Croft is known for. 
The introduction of Alicia Vikander as Lara in this film has the room divided it seems, some say she is suitable for the role and others are for her. 
I am for her in thye role. Sure she might not have the big boobs and voluptuous lips, but that is of no issue to me and too be honest, Alecias physique is much more realistic for someone who does what Lara does. 
The movie itself is a direct take off of the newer Tomb Raider (2013) game and (in my opinion) it has been done well. I would like to have seen more puzzle solving and acrobatic ""tomb raiding"", but I guess there is only an hour and a half. Perhaps the next installment (if there is one) will delve more into this area. 
It is a great film that deserves an audience that is not only into the franchise, but also open to a few (minor, some may say major) changes.

However, what I liked the most was the third, for showing the various challenges she went through.The special effects have heights in which they stand out and others in which they easily notice that it is a greenscreen, especially in the final part of the film.On the other hand, what stands out most in the film is the soundtrack, which in my opinion, makes the viewer feel inside the plot.",Tomb Raider

+ Story works
+ No boring burdon from the gamecharacter interaction feels a bit shallow at timesLara remains an unknown (just like in the games...)TL;DR This is more or less a perfect movie adaptation of the 2013 Tomb Raider game. If you disliked the game for beeing drawn out, you will like this.",Tomb Raider

The problem is the story; there's just not a whole lot to it. You'll see every beat coming a mile away, there's just nothing new here.

The movie starts with the new age feminism showing female wannabe males all over the place and how white males are all dumb meat.Acting and Directing:
-The main character is just as dull as her storyline with non existent character developement as are the other characters we meet on the way.
-Directing is something we see on most B class movies where the director is freshly out in wild to gain some experience, ""go get it tiger !, but don't touch those well established franchises !!! you hear me !?!"".
-The overall acting performance is very bad. A scene full of poker faced robots unable to cope with the (worst in the history of tomb raider franchise) story line.The movie is Trash:

645,notqyteneo,"A Nice, Much Better Take on Lara Croft",9,29 March 2018,"Honestly, I don't see why this film is scoring so low. This is a well-made film all around. The only slight negatives I can see was the villain was a little weak, and at a few occasions, the score was a little too overpowering. But Vikander did a fantastic job.. As a whole the movie had a much richer, more human take on Lara Croft. I hope it makes enough for a sequel, but that seems very iffy right now.",Tomb Raider

The only problem with this movie is the writing and some decisions made regarding editing and music etc, other cast is bland etc.But overall a great action movie, plays a slightly different plot than 2013 reboot but personally i like that Tomb Raider version the most and i feel Vikander does a fantastic job reprising that role. I would love to see a sequel only if she continues but i feel its neccessary to get much better writing.",Tomb Raider
647,jimmylace,It's actually Lara Croft this time,7,19 August 2018,"Whilst Jolie is undoubtedly a strong actress, her Croft was over-the-top, emotionless and cynically self-aware. The movies she starred in were muddled, and drew from one too many genres. The reboot is far better all round, and firmly grounded in the adventure genre. Lara no longer looks like a fetish model, no longer pouts at the camera, and has some vulnerability. She's an actual human being this time around, thanks to Vikander's wonderful portrayal, which goes beyond the page. The first act is the most successful in my view. The script establishes Croft's emotional wound, the flawed persona that's arised from that, and takes the time to create some moments of empathy. It's classic in it's plot structure, right down to Croft's initial refusal of the call to adventure. This movie speaks in the language of cinema, unlike the older ones. It's solid all round, with some likeable side-characters and some unique action. It's weaknesses however lie with the tomb-raiding, and later set-pieces which strain the suspension of disbelief. There's an overuse of CGI, a bland villain, a not-so-interesting MacGuffin, a tomb with overly high tech booby-traps. But all in all, you could do worse thanks to a well structured plot, and a great turn in from Alicia Vikander. I know a sequel is up in the air, but I do hope WB have the sense to keep Vikander onboard. It's not the greatest start possible to the franchise, but it's by no means a misfire",Tomb Raider

649,rklatt07,Don't waste your time - stick with the Angelina Jolie versions,1,19 June 2019,"It should go without saying but then again millions of dollars went in to making this disaster of a movie so the logic has already been tossed out with the baby AND the bath water. This is your typical example of what happens when Hollywood doesn't learn from its mistakes, knows it's materials, or it's audience. Why would you ever think rebooting this franchise would ever work? First off there's the casting - none of the actors have any chemistry, and are flatter than paper. The lead actress is pretty, but nowhere near the standards of portraying Lara Croft - hello, the original was played by Angelina Jolie for crying out loud, and she nailed it, so why do you think casting an average looking, unknown female lead would do this role justice?!The writing is terrible, the plot of the film was so dense that I was completely disillusioned through the entire film. Just save yourself the time and watch the trailer once, and bam you've seen pretty much everything in less than a third of the films actual run time. Also, this film's version of Lara Croft is a complete loser. No fighting skills, no emotional drive, definitely no personality or sense of humor. Everything was forced in all the wrong ways and places. Bad jokes and even worse dialog throughout the entire film. One of the best things about the original Lara Croft is that Angelina Jolie can pull off comedy and still remain a bad ass, gun slinging b*tch. This version of Lara wasn't even pitiful - I tried to like her, I really really did, but she's the epitome of an oxymoron. Dumb enough to pawn what's ""most valuable"" to her for less than 10k when she's just got done accepting her inheritance of billions of dollars (which she basically had to have a gun to her head to do in the first place).I could go on and on about this mess of a movie, but why bother? Hollywood is only going to keep making these horrendous movies as long as people keep paying to see them. Here's a tip, watch this film on a steaming service (not even Redbox) - some platform you already pay for so you can justify wasting your time for free. Or better yet, save a few hours and just watch the trailer on YouTube, trust me I'm doing you a favor. The only reason I bothered sitting through this movie is because it helped make homework easier to get through, sad but true.Hollywood, you remember the saying ""those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it""? Or what about the old adage, ""if it ain't broke, don't fix it""? LEARN FROM PADT FAILURES - stop ruining our favorite movies and tv shows. No you didn't make this version of Lara Croft a better feminist icon - she already was one and instead you made her weak and dumb.",Tomb Raider

This is my favorite movie adaptation of the games though.I loved seeing Lara at the start of becoming what we all already know her to be, the Tomb Raider. Lara Croft has always been a consistent character even through her few reboots. She remains someone who has an analytical mind and enjoys adventure.The movie does a fair job of making the latest video game reboots its own story, for about the first 25 minutes. After that it pulls heavily from the two video games; not a bad thing, I personally would have like to see more of a companion story rather than a retelling of what I already knew. If I hadn't played the games this wouldn't have been an issue to me, the story still flows nicely. Over all even with the few issues I had with it, its an enjoyable experience.

Alicia Vikander is super trained and everything but in my eyes she wasn't the right fit for this role... I missed the charisma... that special glimpse that made me feel with her...
Then there were some scenes that seemed a bit over the top... the missing dad who managed to stay alive all these years on the island with the enemy around. And when she jumped sooooo far, my only thought was: Only Legolas can do that and he is an elf! 😉

658,matildenunemn,"Lara is terrific, plot leaves a lot to be desired",6,26 March 2018,"There are some great things about this movie, mainly revolving around Lara, who is portrayed as a regular and relatable person, who is fierce and strong, but not in an irrealistic way (that's what makes up for the weak plot)
-She loses fights, grunts and screams and her motion is genuinely impaired after she gets badly hurt
She reacts like any sane person would after first having killed a man, showing real emotion, unlike many action heroesShe struggles to climb or to reach certain places sometimes, because even though she goes to the gym, she is still human!Aditionally, her relationship with Lu wasn't forced at all, not every action movie needs to include full-on romance!
I quite liked the fox-hunting scene as well, it was really fun.
All the fight scenes were incredible and really creative, I might add.On the other hand, the plot about the evil queen and what not seemed a bit ridiculous, even more so when they introduced Trinity, a group of people in search of the supernatural. Who has members all over the world. They tried too hard to make it look like this super powerful organisation, but the main goal of Trinity was absolute nonsense!
Also, small plot hole, I apologize if there's something I'm missing here, but Vogel did not need to have spent seven years on that island, he could've just lied to Ana on the phone, organize his men to force the pilots of the helicopter to fly them home like they did at the end. And if he really wanted to sell it, he could've grabbed a piece from a nearby boulder and pretend it was from the coffin! 
Aditionally, the CGI wasn't that good.
Also, that ending... Nice try, but I honestly thought we were supposed to have assumed Vogel was working for trinity at the beggining, and that Ana thing was just a desperate attempt at a plot twist.",Tomb Raider

In brief, this movie primarily suffers from pacing issues. 
Beyond that, the third act (finally encompassing what the game and trailers promised us) is so radically different from the source that they may as well have written it from the ground up as a standalone film rather than an adaptation of an existing property. 
Without going into specifics, the experience is also hindered by a myriad of plotholes, character inconsistencies, tonal shifts, logical fallacies and CGI more befitting the Angelina Jolie predecessors than a current big-budget Hollywood action/thriller.

Stupid plot with a B action scenes which are rare . And most the action scenes ive seen in the video game while playing it !!! So why the hell I paid the money for to see the same action scenes in a cheaper way.
The character of Lara is terrible, well actually stupid and only didn't die the whole film because the script said so.
Her father asked her to burn all his work and she immediately open it without thinking just like that and at the end her father says thanks ( for what for doing something stupid!!!)
One of the most stupid scenes was the camera that her father left it for her in the secret room for 7 years and she just played it without charging it FOR THE LOVE OF GOD who wrote this scenes.
But the most ### is the helicopter scene the helicopter was made for military service which means it so strong and difficult to broken and our hero wants to broke it with her arrow that is a hand made!!! ( What kind of s### is that!!!)

667,Emmet_L_Brown,Great entertaining,9,17 March 2018,"Let me open this review mentioning that I never played the game.That being said, I went to the theatre with mild expectations, as, the previous Lara Croft films were, for me, borderline, relaying to much in close to super-power abilities and had a too big fantasy or supernatural element in them. Yes, I am a big fan of Indiana Jones and it also has the same elements but, I guess I like the series so much because Indy is not flawless or capable of extraordinary stunts, like Lara on the first two films.After just a couple minutes shy of two hours later, I exited the room greatly satisfied. I never looked away from the screen, and Lara's character development was neatly done. When she got her ass kicked at the beginning I thought ""What the hell is going on here?"" and it soon became clear the storyline the director/screenwriters decided to follow. From that point on, Lara's journey from a very down on earth delivery girl into a multi-billionaire action heroine become a rollercoaster of events, lots of action, some injuries, many moments where her humanity and emotions are explored and even her inability to fit her new role so easily. The decision to keep the supernatural element out of this film was also a good one, and the plot twist close to the end, concerning Himiko, is a very intelligent (and plausible) one.
 
Tomb Raider is by no means Oscar material but has a decent plot, great CGI, action scenes are good and well executed, some banter here and there, an immersive score and some pretty decent acting by Alicia, showing a strong vein for action movies. All in all, very entertaining.9/10",Tomb Raider
668,gregthmann,Outstanding and a real plus for game fans,9,16 March 2018,"Alicia Vikander is absolutely amazing in this Tomb Raider prequel. From the start of the film, Lara is in London and shows her strong mentality and as the film progresses, you can see that Lara is a very focused Girl but with some apprehensions. The cinematography is superb and the bike chase left me in awe. As Lara heads further on in the film, her stubborness starts to show, as does her resolve and abilities. I would certainly recommend this film to any Tomb Raider or Indiana Jones fans and you won't be disappointed. I was shocked at how empty the Imax was in truth and hopefully this changes as the weekend arrives. I would certainly watch this again.

The back story is irrelevant as well, and the island storms et al mean zero to the idea of the movie when they should...

671,alexthomas-yk,Does Justice to the Video game and the legend Lara Croft,8,17 March 2018,"I'm writing this review because to a lot of negative reviews out there just because some people don't like Alicia as Lara, well they're wrong Alicia is more believable as Lara. This is not a glamorous movie like Angelina Jolie's previous movies. There is no cleavage show like previous installments. Angelina's movies were based on the games from 1990's and this is purely based on the reboot games, so please don't compare them, it's pointless! I loved both the reboot games and I think movie did justice to the game. At present, for me this is the best video game based movie out there, not a masterpiece or ground braking but entertaining and it does somewhat crack the video game based movie curse.It'll be easy to understand the background story for those who played the reboot game and for other they have added background to Lara and her father Richard's life which helps. It takes a little while for Lara to learn about her father's location and to get there but the build up is done well. From the starting itself you're told about the legend of Himiko and her handmaidens and more is revealed as she gets to the island. Credit to the director and crew for the cinematography and wonderful action scenes.All the cast did a wonderful Job and Alicia was great as Lara. There are times when you feel like you're watching the cut scenes from the video game, she's that good. Dominic West as Richard Croft was good, the father daughter relation was spot on. Daniel Wu doesn't have much screen time but he has also done a great job. Walton Goggins did his best like he always does. When it comes to playing bad guys he's one of the best, but I felt like he was a little under used. What makes his scary good is that his character does what he says, if he threatens to kill someone he ends up doing it. This movie is more of a character study. It explores Lara's background as a child, teenager and an adult and explains well how she becomes the tomb raider we know of. ""First kill is always the hardest"" Alicia hits the right spots when it comes to express emotions. Alicia is a wonderful actress and she has proved it, this is her movie. There are some flaws too but I'm sure you won't mind it. If you're a fan of Lara Croft you must see this movie and judge it yourself, beware of the fake reviews written by those who are disappointed by not seeing much cleavage.",Tomb Raider

While as a fan I felt there were certain elements they borrowed/adapted from the game that could have been done better, I enjoyed it very much for what it was: a fun, flighty, likeable fantasy adventure romp.Roar and Alicia Vikander prove they're great at what they do. This version of Lara is a little more cocksure and street smart than the version we see in the new games, but Vikander delivers such a completely believable, earnest and human performance, that I fell in love with this ""new"" Lara almost instantly.Walton Goggins provides a deft supporting turn as the film's villain, unfortunately nothing at all like his video game namesake and completely relegated in the end as not much more than a mere pawn in what's set up to be a bigger game. However, his acting was never a notch short of fantastic, and I enjoyed him being on the screen every time.My hopes are sincerely that Tomb Raider gets its audience, the cast and crew return for a sequel or two or three, and that they take onboard the *constructive* feedback afforded to them in other reviews and implement them to improve on what is already a good, strong formula.

675,pajamawolfie,Watch it on cable if you're bored.,4,25 March 2018,"I just wanted to have fun at the movies. But I didn't.I've played the excellent game it's based on, and the 2001 movie blew my mind when I was 12. I wanted to be as tough and as cool as Lara Croft!The main problem I have with this movie is that I couldn't sympathize with Lara's character.Nothing bad that happened would've happened if she'd respected her father's will. She had no fear to overcome, no great wrong to right. She didn't learn anything. She was nearly indestructible in the action scenes, which would be fine this was an over-the-top adventure movie, but this is a serious, gritty origin story.The plot: Her father's been MIA for 7 years, and Lara won't accept her inheritance because signing a paper would declare him legally dead. She finds his will, which tells her to burn some research or else millions of people's lives will be in danger. She ignores it, takes the research and goes to look for him. She gets shipwrecked on the island, where the evil organization immediately confiscates the research, putting millions of lives in danger.I got more and more annoyed with her. Lara put millions of people in danger for a selfish reason, and shows no remorse. What's heroic about that?The actress? Wasted potential. It's 2018, and big boobs aren't necessary to have a good Lara Croft, so we have Alicia Vikander. She trained hard and did her own stunts. She's ripped and athletic, and looks like the Lara Croft of the reboot games. I didn't really care about her character, but that's on the writers and director, not her.Booby traps and puzzles? There was a severe lack of these, and they show up late in the movie. Maybe two puzzles, a few spikes, and a tile floor that falls away piece-by-piece. There is a puzzle box that Lara solves immediately. What about crazy supernatural forces and cults to fight? No, this reboot is too serious for such nonsense. It's like the movie was so busy setting up a serious origin story that it almost forgot to raid tombs. The London part (except the ""Foxhunt"" bicycle race) was boring.The characters were stupid and took a bunch of unnecessary risks. Why leave the research when you're not coming back? Why trust Lara to burn it? You know she won't. Why didn't you kill that person by kicking them off the cliff? Why are there all these clues to find the queen when she was exiled for committing genocide?There were a couple of shots that hinted at dropped plot threads. Lara had a female friend who I thought would go to the island with her, but she's only in one scene in the beginning. There's a lingering shot of a puzzle box that Lara drops when her boat is going down, making me think it was important, but it's never mentioned again.And the final 5 minutes of the movie had a crazy plot revelation that set up a much more interesting sequel. If that had been the driving force of this movie, it would've been 10x more interesting. Big screen Tomb Raider finally lost the big boobs. Unfortunately, it lost the humor and over-the-top campy fun of the Angelina Jolie version. It also lost the 2013 video game's ""inexperienced girl turning into a survivor"" feel.I'm going to rewatch the campy one were Lara is a superhero who saves the world from the Illuminati.

678,my_movies_land,Silly screenplay,5,29 March 2018,"Rating: 4,5/10
From the trailer I had seen, the film promised well and I had some curiosity in it, but unfortunately it was a big disappointment.
""Tomb Raider"" is a film that fails to entertain or excite, and soon becomes boring because the direction, entrusted to Roar Uthaug, Nordic director of the lucky ""The Wave"" and the terrible ""Escape"", does not offer any particular scene charming. In addition, the scenes often have a cringe tone, due to the bad screenplay by Alastair Siddons, second time screenwriter after directing a film of 2012, and Geneva Robertson-Dworet, debut writer who is currently involved with several films including ""Captain Marvel "", we hope he did a decent job.

It wasn't perfect, but it was entertaining.Now, we have a new Tomb Raider movie that is now related to the games that rebooted the franchise in 2013... and it's ok.Instead of going for the smart-ass and self-confident adventurer, this movie goes for a much more grounded version of Lara Croft (like the game does). I've heard many people say that it feels quite emotional, but I didn't see any of that depth in the relationships Lara had. The writers made the terrible mistake of taking the storylines from two games and trying to put them in a blender to come up with something meaty and powerful. In that regard, it definitely failed.The writers should've concentrated on adapting the first game's story. It's a good story, has a protagonist that has strong motivations and fulfills her arch by the end of it, and it has a heart. Instead, they kinda based it on it, the character kinda has motivations, and kinda cares for what's going on around her.Is it worth watching? I guess.

I liked the scenes with the bike rides in London. Nice action. Something new. Nice filming. But once she leaves London to go look for her father, it is all down hill from there. So many plot holes and just boring stuff, that is insulting my intelligens:
Why is the elequent guy on the boat, -who obviously went to the US and got an education and a perfect american-english accent - back on that boat? What?, he just desided to ditch the oportunities of the US and come back to the s...hole he came from, after taking an expensive education, and submerce in alcohol and filth for no reason?

And right after having body-river rafted on a speeding rapid, miraculesly NOT bumping knees, elbows or head on the countless sharp rocks of that river - plus be able to hold on (!!) to a bloody parashute with just her two arms, while it unfolds and saves her from getting killed going down through the trees. A parashute. In your arms. Through trees. Oh please..And it goes on and on. It is so anoying. And once you notice, you just can't stop noticing all of it. Like; why would you put a intricate lock on a gate, if you realy dont want anyone to enter or exit? Why not just seal the entrence with a wall or something? Locks are ment to open, right?And why not just kill the bad guy with that ax you throw, in stead of throwing it right next to him, then fist fight with him, then kick out the ladder from under him and then feed him the poisonous desease?

682,cn-11941,Worth On Boring Days...,5,9 June 2018,"Its not unusual to find movies inspired by videogame plots, just like its not unusual to find several kinds of remakes and ""new perspectives"" of past movies. Unfortunatly those are not adjectives that can for sure create a good and criative piece of action and enterteining. 
In Tomb Raider we see a new cast, new director and new formula of screenwriting and development of the story telling about the sexy treasure hunter of the obscure Croft Family. In this movie we deparate with good scenes of action and good special and visual effects, premisses that not necessalary deliver us a good movie, after all. 
The clichés are constant, making the plot predictable in every moment (you can imagine de following scenes and dialogues, the next one to die, the obvious solution for so many stupid problems they have to solve all along the story and the ""oh that again"" conclusion at the third act), namby-pamby moments that almost drive us to cry (not for the characters, but for insulting our intelligence that hard),an actress that doensn't give us the expected charming of bad-ass protagonist, an villain that is so meaningless as whatever other aspects on this poor plot. 
In more technical aspects we have, for exemple, some good sound effects but not a (incridibly necessary) good mix, the visual effects are not bad but Hollywood in his absolutly competance could have done better than this, original score is ok but nothing is markable on it and in final considerations the movie is no master piece in technical area.

683,fericirea,Easily the best film adaptation of a video game,7,17 June 2020,"Overall, I found the movie solidly entertaining, carried by a strong performance from Alicia Vikander as the rebooted pre ""Tomb Raider"" Lara Croft. There are a ton of reviews here comparing (unfavorably) this Lara to Jolie's Lara, mostly flabbergasted about how this Lara is younger, less capable, and adopts a bow instead of her signature double pistols. Ignore all of those reviews, as they make painfully apparent that those reviewers have no idea what's going on. If you played any of the Tomb Raider games that have come out in the past 7 years you'll find Vikander's depiction of Lara accurate and satisfying.A strong performance from Vikander and a solid narrative structure are dragged down by mediocre directing, writing, and supporting cast.

688,liamkenny91,Not the Tomb Raider you know - or want.,3,16 March 2018,"Going into this movie, I had very high hopes - I loved the previous movies (for all their flaws and silliness), and have played and enjoyed almost all of the games, including the reboot this movie is based on. What this movie feels like, is pandering to the ""Lara Croft"" name, it adds nothing new, in terms of the Tomb Raider Mythology or any action movie in general. The script is generic, boring and predictable. The entire cinema actually scoffed at a line close to the end, during a scene which was supposed to be dramatic, but came off as fake and unusual. The characters' motivations were never fully explained, including Lu Ren, who flips between ""this trip is suicide there is nothing that can make me go"" to risking his boat and his life for £1000 within a 30 second scene. The characters themselves seemed entirely one dimensional, there is a scene early on with Lara sharing eye contact with a female which hints at an affection as it lingers for slightly too long, which would have been a really interesting thread for a 21st century twist on her sexuality, but that character is never seen or mentioned again in the film. The ""mythology"" side of the story I enjoyed, while it was more grounded than the previous movies or games, this wasn't a bad thing. Alicia Vikander looks the part, certainly, Daniel Wu is passable, and Walton Goggins, for his credit, is fine. All of which are compliments, because the script is written in such a way that no characters are really able to show depth or development. 
I think my biggest issue with this film is how stupid almost every single character is. Without going into spoilers, there are moments particularly in the final third which baffled me. Why, when trying to kill someone, would you not use a gun? Why, turn back on yourself? Why? Why? Why? The CGI is average, passable in the darker scenes but jarring in the daylight. Action set pieces are few and far between and the plot starts well, but by half way through drags and could do with being 20 minutes shorter at least.",Tomb Raider

Alicia Vikander (Lara Croft) was wonderful as always even though it is not possible to give an incredible performance in a superhero/fantasy role. Please think about that. Alicia is a magnetic force on the big screen, especially if your a guy in your 20s or just a guy with a heartbeat. I only wish somebody threw her name out during the casting sessions for the Hunger Games series so we could all be saved from Jennifer Lawrence giving terrible performance after dreadful performance. Not going to go into deep length on Tomb Raider. Movie had plenty of flaws: really poor acting by side characters like her sidekick boat captain and even her father with all the finger extension kisses, the part where good guys and bad guys are on the same side for a weird 15 minutes and then realizing her dad was actually a bad (he owns a company or many that places individuals into forced labor correct?) guy even though he is adhament about saving the world the entire time. I don't think the producers/directors even realized they did that. Anyway, I'm sure this was a great watch for the 9-16 age range. The action scenes were good for someone that doesn't care for action scenes. Alicia V will get me $12.50 every time cause she's great, alright the fact that she is stunning has a lot to do with it.",Tomb Raider

I will put them in a list (I am basing all of this off of the 2013 Tomb Raider game, which this movie is supposed to be based off of):-Lara Croft has big boobs. That is one of the things that attracts gamers to the game. Nothing against the actress, but this should have been played by an actress with big boobs. 
-The crew on the ship should have been larger. It wasn't a 2 man crew in the game. 
-The father is not in the game on the island. Also, in the game he dies from suicide/murder at his desk in the Croft Mansion.
-Trinity isn't introduced at all in the game.
-The stepmom is not in the game at all and isn't introduced until the 2017 game. 
-Queen Himiko was NOT a good person. She would sacrifice younger girls to give her immortality. 
-The queen was supposed to have an army of samurais too. 
-Also, she was a sorceress. 
-And that brings me to my last point...DON'T. KILL. THE. SUPERNATURAL. ASPECTS! That's what we love about the game (well at least I do). You added the storm in the movie, but nothing supernatural? The storm is supposed to be supernatural to protect the queen and keep people away from the island.

Just like the last games this movie turned Lara into a real person rather than a comic book character or Angelina Jolies pin up-girl. I also loved how they manage to recreated the magic feel of the two last games. They took us to the familiar Island but from there the story diverges.

700,theresews,This film could easily have been so much better,7,22 October 2018,"Okay, first a disclaimer: I love Tomb Raider. I grew up playing some of the originals and then the Legend-Anniversary-Underworld games. Now, back to the review.Alicia Vikander is a stellar Lara Croft, in my opinion. I had my doubts about them turning down the ""sexy""-aspect as well when the trailer came out, but I really like the direction they took. And she has potential to become more confident and flirty in later films, if they want to go in that direction. However, after Vikander's performance, the rest of the movie is a bit of a mess. And what is frustrating about that, is that they easily could have tweaked it to be a much better film.First fix: Kill off her father. Seriously. There was no reason for him being alive. As soon as he turns up, the movie only goes downhill. I will in fact go as far to say that the movie peaks with the ""in-the-mud-wrestle-match"" and then immediately plunges to lower ground when introducing the ""not-dead"" father. He immediately takes over as the ""professional"" and Lara gets shoved off to the sidelines. That is not where she belongs.Second fix: Make Lu Ren a more central character. We actually get a decent introduction to Lu Ren in the beginning, and he progresses to be one of the more interesting, sympathetic characters. However, his character is also sacrificed in the service of bringing back mr. Croft. And then Lu Ren's character arc of being an annoyed drunk, to being a solid friend of Lara's, becomes completely forced.Third Fix: Give villain some back story. I wasn't a huge fan of Walton Goggins as the villain, but I did understand what they were trying to do with his character - attempting to hit a kind of maniacal note. But he just becomes so inherently generic, and it's so boring. He works for an evil organization that attempt to rule the world. Just please, elaborate on him. Does he have family? What are his own values? Or at least, what does he want to do with the world, when they take it over?Fourth fix: Better tomb puzzle. Come on, the puzzle with colored stones in light beams were just uninspired. Why not pull up one of the puzzles from the games, with weights and ropes? What would be so terrible about that?Fifth fix: Stay true to the realism. In this movie, they really attempt to give you a realistic Lara Croft. She is ripped, she struggles, she cries, it hurts when she falls and so on. And the big, scary supernatural queen is actually just a carrier of disease. So okay, if you choose to go that way, you have to be consistent. If you stand in a ditch and five people with machine guns shoot at you down into that ditch, you will all die. If you open a parachute while falling from a waterfall, and you don't have it strapped to your body, you will not be able to hold on to it. It quickly conflicts with the idea of Lara being a realistic survivor, that she also somehow appears to be indestructible.In my opinion, if they fixed these things, this movie could easily have been an 8-movie. It's a shame they chose to sacrifice so much of her personality development for action scenes. I hope they make another movie, better.",Tomb Raider

She was tall, lean, sexy. Vikander, by comparison, is rather short at 5'5"" and rather skinny (but she is ripped for the film). It just doesn't feel like Lara Croft. It's more like Lara Croft's kid sister. No offense to Alicia Vikander. She's beautiful, but she just doesn't fill the bra, pardon the pun since Croft doesn't have to be big boobed to work--Gal Gadot proved that with Wonder Woman, of Angelina Jolie or the recent Tomb Raider games. Vikander just doesn't have the screen presence of Jolie's almost cartoonish Croft. Croft is a sex symbol and Jolie was a sex symbol, but Vikander just isn't one. Gal Gadot is a sex symbol and she doesn't have the bra size Wonder Woman always had in the comic, and she killed it without WW's trademark big bust. Make sense?I am not bashing Vikander! She was awesome in Ex Machina and other flicks and is very beautiful. She's just not Lara Croft.And, I must not be alone since my theater was nearly empty.Croft is missing her guns. I was totally disappointed she didn't have her trademark pistols. Big failure of the filmmakers. I was like, NO GUNS! Blasphemy!I wanted Croft, the Tomb Raider, not Croft the little girl looking for daddy. And, yeah, Jon Voight was a much better Daddy Croft! Jolie, because it was his daughter in real life, had instant chemistry together.Anyway, the stunts were excellent and you actually believed Vikander could do them since she was buff and rough. But, let's face it, bad girl Jolie, at the time, was Lara Croft. Vikander is a girly-girl not a bad girl. Jolie was the hot bad girl. Jolie was also a megastar, too. Vikander is just now finding her way.Vikander did an excellent job acting. Jolie was not as good as Vikander in range, but she was manic and free-spirited where Vikander is polished to a tee.I really couldn't get over how short Vikander is. Croft is an imposing 6 foot tall vixen, even in the new games, while Vikander is a short 5'5"". With Gal Gadot as Wonder Woman, she was a tall 5'10"" and had an amazing sneer that reeked of sexiness and determination. Vikander is beautiful, but she's not sexy like Croft, Jolie or Gadot. Croft has always been the sexy Brit, new game or old ones.The tomb of that Japanese chick: Croft, with Jolie, stole Time and found the mystical Cradle of Life. It was supernatural like the games, too. Vikander finds a dead queen with a virus. I was like, huh? What?! No supernatural stuff? Really disappointing. The film is excellent, even though it is Lara Croft's kid sister we are watching not the Lara Croft of game's lore. Croft doesn't need big boobs, but she does need to be sexy, wily and frenetic. Vikander, unfortunately, just wasn't any of those things.",Tomb Raider

I have enjoyed the Tomb Raider Games on the PS4 & when I went to see this movie, I got the same amazing & thrilling experience which I got when playing the game. This movie is not as bad as the critics rated it to be but there are 1 or 2 cons in this movie which I dont think I want to give out cause it will then be a spoiler. The story is simple/basic but there are a few twists in the middle/towards the ending which will be AMAZING!! This movie is really good because of the ""twists"" & without the twists, the movie would actually be really bad cause the story is really nothing amazing without the twists.

711,kbarnhart-48446,Maybe the worst (Major Release) film of 2018,2,12 December 2018,"**This review contains spoilers**
This is maybe one of the worst films I have seen in 2018. The Tomb Raider game was known for its buxom lead character, in a light and fun, tung & cheek entertainment action/adventure vehicle that got a slight retooling when it was developed for a movie, and Angelina Jolene's bra was developed into a D-cup. This version is far from entertaining, full of B (and C) list actors, along with the unlikeable Dame Kristin Scott Thomas, who we find out, at the very end, is the supreme bad-guy. What little story is presented, even less cohesiveness or point is evident. The script is vague, and the overall tone is slow and mean-spirited with point blank murders. Our protagonist, Laura Croft, played by the emotionless Alicia Vikander, apparently develops marine-scale bravery and navy-seal-level athleticism and cunning on the fly on her first mission in a remote island jungle fresh from jolly old England. Nothing really gets explained in the movie, and the last1/3 of the movie, which I assume is its climax, echoes that of Raiders of the Lost Ark. Laura also develops an intense ability to immediately decipher puzzles that skilled archeologists could not do. The film meanders, is slow, and boring, with no likable characters, and shamelessly sets up the sequel with cliche'd humor. I wish I had that 2 hours back.",Tomb Raider
712,rahafmusmar,Boring and Cliché,3,9 August 2018,"Not even halfway through the movie, and I got bored. There's no background to the characters, everything is super dull and unoriginal.

She was a super important character in the story with Himiko! And not to mention Lara's Dad wasn't even alive in either of the games. That didn't make sense until he actually died at the end of the movie. Then the action...NOT ENOUGH!! I'm dead serious! Why didn't we see a lot of action of Lara shooting her bow! Or a gun at least. Then there's also Trinity and Mathias. Mathias was NEVER PART OF TRINITY!!!! Trinity was introduced in THE SECOND TOMBRAIDER GAME!!!!

There was nothing interesting about this film, not a single thing you can get excited about. As lot of other folks have said, Lara seems to be Terminator. Nothing affects her, nothing. You just met your father after 7 years who you thought was dead but after few hugs, you are ready to leave him to die again. Are you kidding me? This personally offended me. This franchise deserves to stay dead based on this movie. If you haven't seen it, please don't. With movie pass, you don't pay for movie tickets sort of. This movie isn't worth the gas I used in my car to get to theater and the steps I took from parking lot to the seat. This is one of those movies where I wish we could ask for our money back.

Game fans like me instantly connected with the action sequences copied neatly from the 2013 reboot and were super excited. What all i got was a highly mediocre 'Richard Croft' who at the end seemed better dead than alive and a 'lara Croft' who had no flare. Don't take me wrong, Alicia Vikander is not a bad choice for the role, it's just the shift from the supernatural to the everyday Bond movie biological weapon twist that irked me the most. Throughout the movie I didn't think much of the deviations from the game but when Himiko turned out to be a dead corpse riddled with an instantly infecting pathogen I lost my cool. You don't make a Tomb Raider movie without the supernatural. In the earlier games Croft has battled forces augmented by the likes of Anubis, the Egyptian God of Death and faced Jörmungandr, the world serpent (which was a mechanical device but at least had some flare and enormous size). Overall, Alicia is fitting nicely in her role except the living a hobo cycle courier lifestyle but the movie has no charm and place in the Tomb Raider genre.

There is nothing fresh on it, not interesting, everything is boring and predictable.
I can't not start to imagine how anybody could think this was a good idea, it's a complete plot hole abomination.Also too many stupid mistakes that could've been easily avoided.
The initial scenes of lara in the gym had nothing to do with anything, totally idiotic dialogue.
The whole situation of lara having to work doing deliveries to survive, and them pawning her father's gift to travel to the otherside of the world, is total nonsense.
Playing the tape on a fully-charged video camera after 7 years? yeah, right.Lets jump an small cliché list:
-getting her backpack robbed on arrival? check!-getting it back after fighting the robbers? check!-falling into a river to escape from a persecution? check!-an upcoming big waterfall inmediatly after the fall? cheeeeck! -saving from the fall just before the very last moment? cheeckckckckc!-finding her dead father alive? check! -A whole search group could not find him in a small island in years, but she finds him just the first day! wow-after 7 years of the bad guy not finding his dad he finds it just after lara finds him? you guess it: yes! makes total sense!Also the whole story is boring, and the way it's told is horrible.

It established Lara as a fighter and competitor well-fit to become the adventurer she is to be. The fox hunt showed her to be intelligent as well as athletic... until the crash.And that's when the movie crashed.Enter the Guardian and the background story. A really, really STUPID background story.Lara is living a life of poverty despite a vast fortune being at her fingertips. The writers have contrived a wholly unrealistic ""legal"" mechanism that is preventing her from accessing her wealth unless SHE declares her father dead. Boys, we've seen this. It was Batman. Alfred inherited the Wayne estate until Bruce returned and then they reversed the process. This is not a difficult problem. Not to mention that they corporate empire she is heir to would not allow her to impede its functioning in this way. The decision would be out of her hands.And even if it was, somehow, are we really to believe that she did not have her own trust fund to live off of? Are we really to believe that she won't go to university? This was a lame attempt to make her a sympathetic working-class hero. Give it up boys you can't have it both ways.Finally, when she IS about to give in and ""sign the papers"" she pulls back, sells her ONE momento from her father for a ""mere"" 8K to run off to find her father. If she were so smart, she would have signed the papers and had vast resources to use to go find him.But, no, she's a girl and her emotions are shutting off her brain.And that's where the rest of the movie goes. In fact, this movie with a female protagonist fails the Bechdel Test.She is not the hero. She is a plot device that the male characters can use to move the plot forward. In one scene, you can't help but scream ""This was better in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade!"" And you know what? It was! and it was BELIEVABLE in Last Crusade.Indiana Jones was, in fact, Dr. Henry Walton ""Indiana"" Jones PROFESSOR of Archaelogy. Lara Croft is a heartbroken girl who has abandoned higher education and DIDN'T EVEN KNOW OF HER FATHER'S archaeological work until years after he is gone. Oh, but she is a whiz at solving puzzles.So, somehow, this untrained girl has in depth historical, mythical and archaeological knowledge from WHERE? It wasn't part of her education or upbringing.

740,tomislav-nikolic000,Not what I expected,8,5 January 2020,"Given I came in with the expectations from the video game, the movie was pretty enjoyable.The 2013 video game Tomb Raider was a series reboot like no other. The movie, in comparison, felt kinda ""meh"".Despite the movie following the story of the 2013 reboot, all the similiraties felt more like little nods rather than attempts to stay true, not to the story, but rather the atmosphere of the game.Nonetheless, those little nods to the game were enough to reignite my interest in the movie every 10-15 minutes of the movie.I can imagine a non-gamer (like my parents) enjoying the movie but not without someone like me giving them fun facts about how the story, characters and visuals, were 2-3 times better in the game.But comparing the screen time of 2 hours with 20 hours of play time is not fair, and I would automatically dismiss any review coming from a gamer; because a gamer will watch this movie and probably want to replay the game. That, of course, being a bad thing; the most fascinating elements, the story, the mystery, are not the in the movie.All in all, it's not a bad movie. It's not the Lara Croft we've watched before, but for a reboot of a franchise we love is not unwelcome either.

748,celestine1307,"Finally, the video game movie curse is broken. Let's hope it stays that way.",7,12 March 2018,"Video games have never managed to cross over to the film industry. Vice versa. Video games based off films are also mostly pretty bad. Both forms of entertainment just cannot capture the same escapism entertainment that its predecessors format managed to provide. Video game movies have an exceptionally long track record of being really bad. From horridly, unwatchable adaptations such as ""Super Mario Bros."" and ""Street Fighter"" to whole franchises based on them such as ""Resident Evil"" and ""Silent Hill"" to even recent forgettable messy adaptations such as ""War Craft"" and ""Assassin's Creed"".It's amazing how the closest to a decent film is 2016's ""Angry Birds"", however, even that is made for kids and is only borderline entertaining in parts. As you can tell from what I have just said, video game adaptations in films have never been good and they somehow managed to tarnish the reputations of the great games they adapt from. Thus, the video game curse became a huge trope in the world of cinema.Angelina Jolie's ""Lara Croft: Tomb Raider"" films fall into the same category as the rest of the video game movies. Although, I would not exactly call them bad films as they provided a fair bit of entertainments and would serve more as guilty pleasures. The films aren't really dated too. Angelina Jolie is still as relevant as she is today as when she was back then.There is really no real reason to make newer tomb raider films and expectations for this reboot were low. However, with the news that Academy Award winner Alicia Vikander is taking on the role, this project all of a sudden intrigued me. You see, I didn't play the games before nor do I care for the original films but the marketing really sold me on it and I finally went in with much caution.Boy, was I surprised. ""Tomb Raider"" is not only the first film to break the video game curse and the best video game movie out there but it is also by itself, a really solidly entertaining ride. First up, the film did a really great job servicing the game it is based off. There are so many great moments present that make you feel like you are playing a game. We follow Lara Croft on her journey and immerse ourselves from one action set piece to another.I can't stress how fun this was to watch. We constantly feel the peril Croft is in and that is credited to Roar Uthaug's slick direction. There is an urgent pace throughout the film and Uthaug manages to captures what makes the games fun in the first place. There is also a good grasp on the lore from my limited understanding of the game. The story focuses on the intimate moments and mystery elements of Croft's origin which I felt lacked from Jolie's films. This made Vikander's Croft a really layered and interesting character. They even made the character most effective weapon in the film to be her brains.I think there is little doubt that Alicia Vikander is stunning in ""Ex Machina"". She totally owns the role of Lara Croft. I cannot say that she's better than Angelina Jolie nor Jolie is still the better one but she totally showed her commitment as the adventurous Croft and she performed it not just mentally but also physically. Here she is more ripped than ever and where as a subpar actress would have just been eye candy, Vikander allowed us to really feel for her character and follow her.The rest of the cast is equally pleasant to watch. Although, I must say, the title character does over shadows them and makes them a little underused and underdeveloped. This is especially so for Walton Goggins as the villain. I felt despite his decent performance, it is still an average villain. My other gripe is that the film is a little by the numbers and predictable at parts. There are some misteps here and there. I think many people will find this to be an average movie but I seriously did have a lot of fun watching it. Junkie XL gave another riveting score too.Overall, it's an origins story done right and solid entertainment. Especially loved the character motivations and the set-pieces. I can't wait for another tomb raider film with Vikander. Thank god the video game curse is broken but let's hope it stays that way.",Tomb Raider
749,sydwil,This girl survives everything...despite her stupidity,4,9 July 2018,"This movie has some good action scenes, but I was not able to enjoy them because it was Laura Croft's stupidity that landed her in all of the fights. Her character is determined to stop the cliche bad guys in the most unnecessarily complicated ways possible throughout the movie. The script is pretty cookie cutter, and most of the actors are not that great. Despite these things, this movie was entertaining to a degree and the lead actors were pretty good. The movie also had a good exposition.",Tomb Raider

757,radelitegaming,Was ok.,6,18 March 2018,"***No spoilers first paragraph ****
Vikander played an ok Lara Croft and ill give her points for her dedication to the role but the movie didn't play off very well. The first 30 minutes were unnecessary and could have been spent on more...you know tomb raiding and figuring out puzzles like...you know....Lara Croft.....Vikander seems little short for the role too imho....
***Spoilers*****Don't even get me started on the bike race, seriously the whole time I was just like......why.......not to mention she sucks at everything until she finally lands on the island and then somehow magically she doesn't suck at everything. The real Lara would laugh at anyone trying to take her backpack >.>Half the fun is the journey as people say and tbh she didnt really explore the environment or face any challenges in surviving after the plane scene which is another big part of the Lara Croft series.The movie answers questions too fast and doesn't give you time to really be pulled in to the story. You could leave and miss ten or so minutes and not really have missed anything important. Was a little cool to see her father but lets be honest, he was an unnecessary character.Then the whole plague thing with the witch....seriously.....they traded undead samurai and a witch who controls the very nature of the island and massive fortresses for iddy biddy room with some jack in the box that has the dark rot from the hellblade game.All in all it was an ok movie but like most movies these days it doesnt really do anything new just same old same old. Kinda like how disney rehashed A New Hope as the force awakens.In a perfect world the Duffer Brothers would make a show that better follows the true story or at least come up with their own.",Tomb Raider

759,JoshuaMooreBE,Nothing original with weak preformances,4,22 March 2018,"Personally, I prefer my Lara Croft to be someone who wants to adventure because she wants to, not someone who is doing it because of daddy issues but I can look past it. She ain't no Samus. Also, I've never seen the original Angelina Jolie movie so don't expect to have a comparison for that either. Maybe I'll watch it later who knows.This movie is eeh. I promise you unless you've never seen any movie ever you can predict half the dialogue and 90% of the scenes that will take place. I could predict what most of the characters were going to say during certain scenes. I predicted how the main villain was going to die the moment we meet him. There are so many cliche lines and scenes you've heard and seen before in this film that it's impossible not to get distracted by it. The only scene that really stuck with me in any way was the brief scene where Lara kills someone for the first time. Besides that, I couldn't name anything in the film that I'm going to remember by the next time I see any other movie.Also maybe I was just in a weird mood but this film had some really mixed acting in it. The only person I felt was good was our lead Alicia Vikander. Besides that everyone else just kinda played their roles, except Daniel Wu who's line delivery was awful especially during the climax. He didn't seem too frightened about his friend's potential death.Also, the plot was kinda silly and unexplained. Now I know their source was a video game, a medium not known for fantastic plot, but some key points in the plot just feel unnecessary and are present just to have conflict. Basically, these group of people who work for a business or something really want this spooky evil power from a corpse buried deep in a mountain on an island. But some things are unexplained or presented so uninterestingly that I forgot about it. Most importantly why are they so evil. I understand they need to be an antagonist but literally, everything they say and do is evil and douchey. Why is your antagonist so 2D? A good villain is someone you love to hate or someone who can present themselves as fun to watch. This guy is just boring and evil for no real reason. He also makes a lot of stupid mistakes in the end that make no sense. Good thing he did that thing at the end to the corpse for no logical reason or else we might've not had our satisfying ending. I know I'm getting a little spoilerly but really there's nothing in this film you couldn't predict. It's not awful, but I'd rather have something be awful and stick with me than something that you forget by the time you leave the theater.",Tomb Raider

761,kalinmirchev,It's NOT a Lara Croft movie!,3,22 May 2018,"Let's face it, this movie got absolutely NO Lara Croft background or feeling involved. Lara Croft that I know is established archeologist with extensive martial arts and guns training, and this is why she is able to go thru all of the ancient tomb puzzles and traps. 
The character in this movie is another ""Instant Gratification"" SJW idol that wins with no knowledge and no training, and of course - no looks. It's just sad how far this has gone with the entertainment industry nowadays. Seriously, this ""Lara"" is beaten up to the dust by some noname in the gym, but then she wins over an armed military leader with bare hands? Really? She never went to college, never studied archeology (or anything in that regard), but she is instantly good with solving ancient mysteries.... how? Why? Just because her missing-all-life father (supposedly established professor himself!) told her she is the smartest in the family... why? No logic involved, no character progression of any kind, no hard work/learning curve to achieve success - it's all Instant Gratification. 
And don't even make me start about the looks of this ""Lara"". It's the utmost opposite to what Lara Croft is. Seriously, Lexus in Powder Blue is more feminine than this. And NO, it's not about the lack of tits, it's not about the lack of ass, it's not about the look of Alicia Vikander at all - it's all about what character the producers/director/actress created and portrayed in this movie - stripped off all that makes a person looks like a woman.

Yes, there are a couple of ""clichés"" in it - like in all blockbuster movies. And the visual effects are not always convincing. But otherwise the movie has a solid story, a great rhythm (a little bit of drama mixed with occasionnal but well-timed humour and several truly good action scenes), interesting characters, beautiful environments... Most of all, for the first time in my life I almost had as much pleasure watching a movie as playing the video games it was inspired by: the movie contains all that define the (new) TR games - scenes of exploration, of infiltration, of action - all filmed in a clever way that makes a video game player almost feel that he has the controller in his hands and that he is the one actually guiding Lara through this great adventure.",Tomb Raider
771,kenclark-2,Believable as Lara Croft the same way Matt Damon works as Bourne,8,26 December 2019,"It's always driven me nuts that they had Angeline Jolie in action roles. It's just so ludicrous - she has clearly never been in physical shape to fight her way out of paper bag. It would have been like casting Jeff Goldblum as Jason Bourne. But, you know, the Lara Croft of the old video games had a huge chest, and in that one regard, Jolie kind of worked.Here, on the other hand, we have someone who looks physically capable of actually doing some of the things Lara Croft has always done. The fight scene early in the movie actually looks possible. Vikander is believable running, jumping, hitting, etc.The problem with the movie is that people are so used to action/adventure films that the action isn't new. The traps in the temple are out of Indiana Jones movies. The people on the island are from a dozen other movies. So, a perfectly reasonable action adventure seems a little slow to most people. Still, it's all so much better than the silly things Jolie's Croft was doing that it's totally worth watching.",Tomb Raider

1st Alicia Vikander is stellar, we are not dealing with a super-woman, but a strong-woman in an agonizing situation and she brings so much realism to the role.
2nd Non-Action scenes kept your interest with cleverly crafted dialogue and scenarios that entertained throughout.
3rd the action was top-notch, filled with plenty of grit, no shaky cams, realistic MMA fighting, you felt like you were not watching an invincible Wonder Woman breeze through enemies, but a strong woman triumphantly surviving each scenario by the skin of her teeth.

So...she still needs a man's blessing to be her own person...ok...Either way, aside from some cool scenes/shots that give service to fans of the video game, the movie is quite forgettable and is something that's been done about a million times before...and better.

This movie is everything a fan could ask for, I mean, is the same character from the videogame with a few new twist to make it fresh and interesting. Alicia Vikander is Lara Croft with no doubt, you can tell she had FUN making this movie, and her muscles and the strenght she shows during the whole movie is remarkable.

784,oleksabunyk,You can watch this.,7,7 July 2018,"Movies based on video games, and games based on movies, never become prominent ones. This fact always disappoints fans, because after every successful movie/game with great action/plot they cry in the internet about continuation in another format. And it is not clear if everything must remain the same, or change things really hard. And results also often are unclear. New Tomb Raider didn't become an exception. Based on the video game with the same name, the movie gets a shorter plot, worn characters, not the best action scenes and slightly lame picture. But not everything is so gloomy, so let go deeper.The story is slightly different from the game, and it isn't bad at all, because it perfectly fit into movie timeframe without a feeling of a plot being cut. All magic things were cut out, all story explains nicely without it. And despite the fact, that movie was created based on a game, the plot doesn't look second-handed, there are similarities but they look more like references to the game not as lack of imagination. So I haven't any complaints to screenwriters.Characters are worse (definitely), because despite there are only four of them, only one shows some charism (Lara), others are so cliched that you cant just omit this. Especially ""good"" are cliched ways to show characters: the villain will always by himself kill innocent worker for fail, and sidekick will risk his life for the girl who you know for little time, and who is the reason of your misfortune. And motivations are also really bad, but the story is driven somehow.Also, the picture on screen disappoints (well it wasn't expected), because as we know, good CGI you will not notice, but in this movie, you will. And action in this movie also isn't good, of course, there is no need to sacrifice realism to reproduce game action, but you can make better. Airplane scene was good anyway.But the movie does what must be done - it is fun to watch, and it doesn't matter if you played the game or not. The movie isn't a fail at all.",Tomb Raider

I played the games, both the old ones and the new reboots that this movie draws from. I love those games. I like this film. I like this film because it nods to its video game source without being obnoxious. Yes, there are scenes that could easily be pulled from the games, only having to remove the button prompts, but those scenes feel part of the flow of the narrative and Lara's character growth. The plot is a combination of both new games without following word for word, which allowed the players such as myself a nice surprise. I have to give applause to Alicia Vikander's performance of Lara, and I look forward to her being a star actress.That being said, this film feels like it could have been more. More exciting, more wondrous, more grand, I admit I'm not entirely sure. Still, better only to have reached out a little and succeeded, and reached out far and failed. I am referring to Assassin's Creed, which still haunts me. However, Tomb Raider is not better than Resident Evil (the first one), or the first Silent Hill.

Alicia Vikander and Dominic west add real dramatic heft and I've always had a soft spot for Mr Goggins. It's nothing groundbreaking by any means but competently put together and if you're a fan of the games you'll see quite a few similarities (though they've wisely jettisoned the more fantastical elements). Alicia V.

799,gaijin100-131-532067,Give me back Angelina,1,19 June 2018,I liked Alicia Vikander in many other movies (especially Ex Machina) bu she's simply not Lara Croft. I liked the way she looked and the physicality but when she talks - that nasal delivery just spoils it all.The plot was very thin and annoying. Daniel Wu was underused.No sequels please. Do another reboot with better writers.,Tomb Raider
800,danielle_davis94,Predictable,6,20 August 2018,"Whilst I enjoyed the film and would probably watch it again, it falls in line with a lot of films these days where I seem to be able to predict what is going to happen next i.e
Her father is presumed dead? of course he will show up later.
She loses a fight in the opening scene? She will have to fight to save her life later.
A recording asks her to destroy all research? Naturally she takes it with her.
and so on.
So as I said I enjoyed the film, even if the tension fulled scenes did nothing for me, I mean, come on, am I really supposed to believe that Lara Croft is going to die 3/4 the way through the film? (waterfall/plane scene) it just means I roll my eyes a lot.",Tomb Raider
801,krystalhupfer,I can't think of a good reason to watch this....,4,15 June 2018,".....The only thing that's good about this film is Vikander's acting. I actually feel bad for her. I couldn't imagine being so talented and working so hard to become this character and then have to work with crappy scripts and story development. It was incredibly predictable at times and cliche. When I look back at certain scenes, I wonder what the point was (like the beginning scenes, pointless). And the music! What the hell?! The score is supposed to create emotion and bring the scenes to life, but this music was rather very obvious and at times in appropriate. This was just a huge disappointment.",Tomb Raider
802,joysofbookworms,Much better than expected,7,16 April 2018,"I went into Tomb Raider with incredibly low expectations and I was pleasantly surprised at how much I liked it. While I wouldn't call it a favourite, I did really enjoyed it - even more so as I think back on it. I really liked Lara as a character; she gets emotional and scared, she has flaws, and she is the embodiment of perseverance and determination. I also really appreciated how there was no romance but instead a focus on family and camaraderie.",Tomb Raider

But this movie was quite disappointing experience.
Plot was weak, TR character was weak, and a lot of scenes looked like they have been created just before camera started rolling.
Dominic West (actor who plays father of LC) play was unconvincing and weaker than he normally performs. 
I would say, if you have never played TR franchise, and you want to watch some adventure movie - then you might enjoy it, once. But if you are a gamer like myself and loved original movie with Angelina Jolie - then you might be disappointed.",Tomb Raider

I'm giving it a 10 because I'm really hoping the film industry finally understands that to create a good movie out a video game you need to ""play"" the video game. This is the first time I actually see some lines of the game in the movie. Even though they shifted slightly from th main plot I think I still honors it... everytime I hear a video game fan saying ""oh, but it's not even close to the game"" I smile. I smile because it's quite obvious that the game will have much more depth, e.g. Tomb Raider (2013) averages more than 20 hours of gameplay and main story. I'll leave it there... I think this time Hollywood understood... and they're trying to make it up to the past ""crap"". Now let's hope for a good ""Uncharted"", ""Witcher"" and, of course, The Last of Us"".",Tomb Raider
810,ketan-33696,Lara Croft is Amazing,9,11 March 2018,"Finally we got one good motion picture which is well adapted from a game. Alicia Vikander is awesome as Lara Croft. Yes, we tend to compare it with Angelina Jolie's version but this movie turns out much better. I truly enjoyed Angelina Jolie's 1st Lara Croft which was over-the-top but enjoyable but this one is more grounded and real. It has few cliche moments but amazing action sequences, great VFX, wonderful story-line makes up well for everything. I am so happy that finally we got a motion picture well adapted from a game. This movie is largely based on 2013 Tomb Raider game and some action sequences reminds me of Uncharted series... Watch this one for sure \m/",Tomb Raider

Shame the script and minor details make you want to pull your hair by the end. Missed opportunity this time round so lets hope they all learn from the mistakes made in this one however even though its disappointing its worth watching as she is a hotty with a tight botty.

814,hollarjohanna,Too much,7,23 July 2018,"It's good. I loved all of the Lara Croft movies with Angleina Jolie. Alicia Vikander did a great, almost impossible job. But the story didn't seem quite right. Mainly because I found as if it was a mix from the plots of the previous motion pictures. 
Furthermore, the writers basically turned this Lara to the opposite. Yet again I have to emphasize Alicia Vikander's great job. Her acting didn't seem forced, yet I know she had a lot of pressure.
All in all, it's a nice movie to watch on a bored summer afternoon.",Tomb Raider

816,dmorales-96287,Raw Potential for reboot,7,6 June 2019,"This tomb raider was based off of the video game reboot and as an avid fan of the video game series I was excited about this movie. They kept a lot of elements from the game the same but changed up the plot with her dad. I'm sad that this wasn't well received but this reboot has a lot of potential. Yes there is definitely work that needs to be done on the writing but Alicia Vikander brought the character to life. She showed the emotion behind Lara's first kill and then the slow progression to who she was by the end of the first game. Love the attention to detail about the progression of the weapons she uses. I wish they would have included more of the cannibals/local tribes from the video game to help propel the Himiko storyline but they can only do so much in 2 hours.
Over all this was a good beginning to what I hope will be a better series than the Angelina mess.",Tomb Raider
817,Chiconyy,"Good adventure/action movie, yet a big disappointment.",7,21 March 2018,"Tomb Raider is a decent adventure with a lot of logical issues (read Lara is Chuck Norris female version). It also feels way too rushed. And that's because Lara spent 45 minutes, which is like 40% of the movie, doing pointless things that did not contribute to the story.Shots are beautiful, but that does not make up for how much letdown this story is. I'd actually rate it lower as a game adaptation, somewhere like 5/10, because the potential was way, way better.The main issue compared to the game is the removal of mystery and magical feel. They just went from a Himiko controlling weather (basically magic) to a disease with some zombie like thingy. They excluded whole point of rituals, of passing the power and Himiko's individuality on and on. Trinity was made into the main antagonist here, when they didn't play a big part in TR2013 game. I was also sad to see (or rather, not to see) the iconic scene of Lara climbing radio tower to send SOS to not be included in the movie. It's a part of the game that gives a true meaning to the ""No One Leaves"" words we also see in the movie. And so on... the movie literally changed everything but few names...Sadly, the script left out some of the best aspects of the game, and added on things I didn't really want to see - mostly the whole part before she finally got on the Endurance - which is also where the game starts right away.I'm giving 7/10 of the love to the original, for some good references such as the necklace, bow skills, shots and angles similar to the game. But to me as a person who absolutely fell in love with the game, this piece is such a letdown and wasted potential. But I guess if I didn't know the potential, it might aswell feel like 7/10. If you liked the movie and didn't play the game - do yourself a favor and either play it, or watch a walkthrough. You won't regret, because there is much more to Yamatai and Himiko.",Tomb Raider

821,charioles,"The game won 'Game of The Year' award, but the movie surely won't win any award.",4,15 March 2018,"This review is based on someone who has played the game version, with that said, I can guarantee that the game fans would be very much feel disappointed with the movie content which is very lacking and unfaithful to what was given in the game.The way I see it, this is a generic case of companies butchering a popular franchise title and milk out more money out of it. That is probably why they hire a no-name director, not top-rated actors, and even ignore the award-winning scenario from the game, so they can cut the cost. This movie's advantage relies solely on the popular franchise name of 'Tomb Raider'.Why is this movie unfaithful? For example, there is nothing mystical or supernatural in the movie version, which means there is no majestic climax scene with thunderous clouds and quakes of Lara against powerful and evil remnants. I will not tell you how it turned out in the movie, but I can assure you that it is utterly disappointing.Lara's crew are completely different. They use chinese actors so they can market the movie to china more easily. How the adventure starts, progresses, and ends in the 'cursed' island are also completely different. Everything seems like done in order to cut cost and be able to market the movie more widely, hence more profit.Overall:
If you have played the game, this movie is like a slap to the face for you and I give it a 3 or 4 stars rating.
If you have not played the game, this movie may be somewhat mediocre-ish and okay for you so I would give it at most 6 stars rating.P.S. There is a hint for a sequel, but I surely hope they do not butcher this good title further.",Tomb Raider

823,eicarbuckle,Much better than Angelina Jolie disasters!,8,21 March 2018,"In the 2013 video game that this movie was based on Laura Croft gets beaten, bruised and injured to an impossible degree. This film has the character go through a lot, but not to the point that is ridiculous or unbelievable. Also, the game was the first of the Tomb Raider series with a Mature rating because it was chalked full of violence, gore, language and satanic and evil images. The movie held a more tame and respectful PG-13 rating and I appreciated that it didn't have any unnecessary sex, jokes, or language. The game holds the same action as the game, with similar situations, yet had its own creative style and story. I was happy that the story wasn't littered with magic spells, snakes, spiders, bats, rats, unbelievable monsters, strange aggressive creatures, or hordes of zombies and crazed mummies. Very little CGI was used, probably because it wasn't needed. Now days movies use CGI and eye candy like it's water from a faucet hoping that alone will sell tickets. (Ahem, Transformers) The tight film editing and music score added to the intensity of the action scenes. Croft is thrown into a crazy environment and just when she feels her life is threatened, the real danger begins. It has all the fun qualities you find in Raiders of the Lost Ark without all the hokey pokey foolishness of the disgraceful Brendan Frasier Mummy movies. As much as I was looking forward to the athletic two hand gun wielding hottie with braided hair to her waist that shot all the bad guys, I'm glad that wasn't what happened. The film did lay a great foundation for satisfying sequels that may contain the action I'm anticipating. The film kept things on a realistic level. Croft was convincing as a hurt, cold, wet, alone and frightened young woman that has to fight to survive and kill for her very first time. Although she accepts the intensity of the situation quickly and realizes she must kill to survive and save others she doesn't go Rambo on everyone. She runs, hides, and tries to escape from bad men just like any scared young woman. It's clear she simply wants to survive, save others, and get home safely. She has a fair amount of fighting skills but realizes they won't do much against a group of armed men and she only uses her skills when she needs to.This reboot was a much better twist on the Tomb Raider concept than the embarrassing and ridiculous 2001 and 2003 disasters. Those movies are a roast for another time. It seems that female action film stars are becoming more popular with the success of Wonder Woman. This I am happy to see. Women actors have been under appreciated and not received their due credit and respect for decades. Some men are complaining that Lara Croft is not curvy enough. I must admit the actress looks a lot different than the original 1996 Croft with humongous boobs. If guys are looking for a film with a sexy, supermodel that packs action instead of a good story and script I'd recommend Pamela Anderson in Barb Wire. I would like to see Stormy Daniels do the stunts, kick butt and fight those bad dudes with the curves she has. I definitely like this new character look over Angela Jolie. This film is based on the release of Tomb Raider game in 2013 which Vikander, who appears to be in her early 20's, looks exactly like. I was more impressed with her abs then her boobs. And her tough kickboxing sparring partner I hope to see working side by side with Croft in the future. If you want to see a movie with a sensual, voluptuous martial arts chick, this is not for you. There was very little I disliked about this film. Of course, movies often have the protagonist running from groups of men shooting magazines full of bullets from machine guns at them, unable to hit them. Same with this movie. Laura runs through the jungle surrounded by gunfire that causes less injury to her than the jungle itself. But ya just have to shrug and accept it's unlikely probability with a sense of humor. Would I see this movie again? Absolutely, and will. I'm looking forward to the sequel and hope they retain the realistic and believable style in the future.",Tomb Raider

Its set-in contemporary timeline of 2017-2018, but Alicia Uses Bow and arrow ! (perhaps to lure Hunger games fan club?)
No robots, no gadgetry, no sensors, no GPS gracking, no infrared, no drones, perhaps because its a remote island, but when people can get other supplies like Guns, explosives(Basic), bows and arrow, why not other required ones for the project. After more than seven years they cant install a satellite connectivity ? 
Lara craft of 2001 had more advanced action sequences than this one. Surely expected more after 17 years of reboot.Camera movements is too fast to really focus and dark at many places to see clearly on whats happening.Her farther has been living in the same island and hides in a cave, has all medical equipment, supplies, and has no issues with food, mosquitoes, snow, rain etc. But what was he doing for 7 years, doesnt plot to kill Vogel, perhaps just sitting there ? Meh !Whats the motive of ""Trinity"" ? Who caresToo many cliches scenes. you dont get much of andreline rush ether.So many goofs, i guess if i list the length of goofs, it will be bigger than the script of the movie.If you got nothing to do, Keep your brain off, grab a popcorn and have fun !But overall, For me its a solid 5 with 3 stars going to Alicia",Tomb Raider
826,rscheetah,Great if you're a true Tomb Raider fan!,8,6 July 2018,"I have been a Tomb Raider - Lara Croft - fan since the original games back in the late nineties. This movie focuses on one of the latest games which for any gaming fan is on of the best. The story goes pretty much the way of the game made that came out in 2013 and does an amazing job of it.The movie - and the game - sees Lara Croft taking a long adventurous trip on an old boat and ending up lost on a mysterious island full of all sorts of adventures and enemies.What I like most about the latest Lara Croft games is the way they have shifted towards the action side of Tomb Raider in detriment of the puzzles which were more present in the older games. This movie concentrates on the action as well as the 2013 game, which for me and probably the casual fans is going to be great.If you're a long time fan of Lara Croft and her adventures then you're probably gonna love this, if not, try to have fun since this Lara Croft does exactly that!",Tomb Raider

I played Tomb Raider games from the beginning and when the first movie with Angelina Jolie appeared I could not see her as Lara at all for some reason. With this movie that is the opposite. Great casting, this actress really materializes Lara Croft, evolving from puppy to the more complete version. Even with the favorite guns in the end scenes. Very well done.The story is surprisingly good as well, with nicely surprising twists in the plot and an consistent storyline. An excellent example of what a well-dosed action mo or can be like.The rest of the cast was very well chosen as well, a pity some characters died in the story - so they can not reappear in a sequel - which I hope will come.In short: an excellent movie, in which we really meet Lara Croft, with an interesting and smart plot and tons of reasons to make you curious for sequels.

834,VasilisGak,Dissapointment and what-ifs,5,14 June 2018,"Being a devoted fan of the rebooted Square Enix Tomb Raider games, I eagerly awaited this one, but my enthusiasm was crushed in mere minutes by this flick that failed to deliver on every note. I guess this a standard failed attempt of a game-turned-movie, that tries to both please fans of the games and project itself to a wider audience, failing spectacularly on both notes.
First things first, anyone remotely acquainted with the franchise, should understand by now, that the story was never Lara Croft's strong suite. And while the latest games have done better in this regard (admittedly not having to compare with much by their predecessors), their success, apart from gameplay has been providing a survival experience. A Lara Croft who has yet to tame nature, who is still learning on the go, who can die a thousand ways and has the sole objective of survival against all odds. In my mind, I could see a brilliant film made out of this, using Alicia Vikander's natural charisma and a basic plot, simply to move things forward, this should have been woman against nature, girl against past, willpower against adversity.
None of this came to fruition. I don't know who to fault, but yet another would-be good film based on a game, became a weekend flick with the sole goal or (re)establishing a movie franchise that's going nowhere with this attitude. Instead, what we actually got was pretty much a video game tutorial level, filled with useless and forced dialogues, next-to-zero stakes (not the wooden ones), too much exploration that befits only a video game, and a botched attempt at securing a sequel.
To put it bluntly, apart from a smart and meaningful plot twist midway through the film, it had absolutely nothing else to offer. Here we are, still waiting on the first truly good film made out of a game, that both respects the source material and is also a creation on its own, and a good one at that.",Tomb Raider

Bond has a parachute up his nose whenever falling off a cliff, and every bad guy misses him with machine guns. Laura pull a a parachute from an old rotten plane, slams into trees, and lands like concrete onto the ground. Not one broken bone. Even her hair still looks good. These movies are Not meant to be real, they're meant to be entertaining, check your brain at the door movies. Did you love Raiders of the Lost Ark? Man I did. Ridiculous? Absolutely. Entertaining? One of the best action entertainment films I've ever seen. Give this film a break. It's a bit of fun. Walter Goggins (Justified) is always great, as was the new Laura Croft.

838,NuncEstBibendum-1,To each his/her own,2,21 March 2018,"Let's be serious here: the Lara Croft character was conceived as a male teenager's wet dream, and little more. In the previous instalments, Angelina Jolie rose to the occasion by wearing appropriate padding and donning the right attire. Alas, Alicia Vikander doesn't do either, which she really, really would need to do, in order to meet the requirement above. Being as she is practically no-one's wet dream, what we are left with is an Indiana Jones wannabee movie. But, we already have Indiana Jones for that. I suspect that this movie is an attempt to bring a mass of female public to the theaters - but chances are that it will alienate all those male teenagers - or not so teenagers any more - who grew up with the video games and movies.

842,Feature_Length,Just Another Underwhelming Video Game Adaptation.,3,18 March 2018,"Tomb Raider has got to be one of the most boring and by-the-numbers action/adventure films I have ever seen a long while. I don't think I came this close to falling asleep during a movie since The Last Witch Hunter.The main actress was good but not great, I'll admit, but everyone else was serviceable at best and nothing to write home about. Except Nick Frost as the Pawn shop clerk. He was pretty cool.However, the characters were utterly uninteresting and boring. Lara is every boring missing-parent protagonist rolled into one bland package. When I first heard that the mother died, I nearly facepalmed, in utter disbelief that it is 2018 and we are still putting the bare minimum effort into our video game adaptations. Both the Father and villain feel like they just took character templates from better movies and made no effort to flesh them out or make them unique.The story was, you guessed it, a bore. Everything up until they reach the island felt like generic filler that was lifted from better movies and really should have been cut down. It did not help make me any more invested in this character. The rest of the movie plays out like a EXTREMELY watered down and childishly predictable Indiana Jones side quest with none of the charm, wit, or intrigue.The action was unremarkable. Not good, but not bad either. Nothing memorable or noteworthy. Ditto for the soundtrack.The only aspect of this film that even remotely caught my interest was the revelation that Himiko's ""death powers"" was actually a very fatal disease for which she was a carrier, and that she actually sacrificed herself to protect her people (contrary to the myth where she was an evil witch who was entombed by her own generals). Plot points involving the supernatural having rational explanations in grounded-in-reality films do interest me. This feels like the only element in the movie that had any effort or thought put into it.But upon learning that this was NOT the case in the video game this movie was based on, but rather from an entirely separate franchise altogether, I could not help but laugh at the irony. I guess the actual concept from the video game was too ""original and risky"" for these filmmakers?All and all, Tomb Raider was a boring and cliche-ridden chore of a film that plays it completely safe and makes no effort to set itself apart from any number of adventure films and video game adaptions. It's literally a bunch of cookie-cutter template characters taking part in a cookie-cutter template adventure without an original bone in its limp body. I have never played the game that this film is based on, but if it really is as bad as this film, then it will probably stay that way.3/10.",Tomb Raider

And so the movie takes you on Lara Croft's first adventure: to find her missing father and to solve the mystery of the Death Queen Himiko. This movie stands well on its own as a solid action thriller. There are several fight sequences throughout the movie, all of which feel very kinetic and very physical. Alicia Vikander's commitment to the role shows really well. The element of mystery regarding Queen Himiko is also handled quite well. But the movie also has its share of flaws, such as a weak villain and a general lack of emotional investment. This could be attributed to the quick pacing of the film, which covers a lot of ground in terms of Lara Croft's development as a character. Overall, this movie is definitely worth a watch for its action sequences and Alicia Vikander's performance as Lara Croft.",Tomb Raider

And Alicia Vikander is my new action hero!Interestingly, this film grossed as much as the Jolie version while costing a bit less and being released 17 years later. Over time it will probably add substantially to that initial kitty.A year later: I'm still amazed, watching the movie again, how good it is. How good Alicia Vikander is! All respect where it's due, but Vikander's Tomb Raider makes Jolie's look ike a munchkin movie.At 75 I hope to live long enough to be able to watch this briliant young actress mature and continue to bring to the screen her incredible talents. All of the actors were great in this film, needless to say. It was/is an extremely well done piece of work!Congrats to everyone involved.",Tomb Raider
852,rfbtmail,Great work by Roar Uthaug!!,10,8 March 2019,"Though I'd never heard of Roar Uthaug (Jeez, what a name!) before watching this movie, I gotta say it was a magnificent piece of work, and he is clearly one hell of a great director. The actors were taken to and beyond their imits, the narrative and the story were perfectly rendered. It is an excellent film in every way. I'm watching it now for the third time. Very rare for me to watch a film more than once but it's that good!Alicia Vikander was, of course, perfecet in her role. As was her father and so many others. Roar Uthaug created a masterpiece.Those who give this ratings under ""7"" or ""8"" are, of course, ignorant of what a good movie even looks like. These morons only want to spew negativity. They are a joke and, needless to say, I ignore their pitiful ""reviews"".This movie is a winner!",Tomb Raider
853,jwilce,"At best boring, at worst a step backwards for female action stars",6,30 March 2018,"The main thing that was clear to me about what the makers of the film were aiming for is that they wanted me to think it was good. The total restraint they demonstrated in neither sexualising Alicia Vikander unnecessarily (or at all perhaps?) nor bending much of reality in any of the action sequences indicates a willingness to make something valuable rather than appealing to the lowest common denominator. Unfortunately, for this viewer, the balance between modern, gritty realism and enjoyability fell in favour of the former.The best scenes were almost exclusively at the start where they roll out the vulnerable, imperfect, ""modern"" Lara, with no impressive CV or even the skills to win a kickboxing match against someone for whom we have no benchmark. They then choose to demonstrate her bravery and resourcefulness with a bicycle race (if you're singing Queen to yourself now, you are not alone).In making Lara much more realistic, they also make her much more boring. Watching someone with an inconsistent ability to fend off enemies, so little world experience that she gets mugged within 5 minutes of arriving in Hong Kong, and whose puzzle-solving skills are limited it seems to Japanese puzzles, is not exactly my idea of escapism. Not to overstate the point, but the sheer quantity of time that Lara was either running away, failing to overcome an opponent, or screaming in agony is in sharp contrast to the Angeline Jolie character's total badass-ery in the face of pretty much anything the world threw at her. I've given it a 6 because there were some elements of excellent writing, particularly in Act 1 and everything involving Nick Frost. Walton Goggins also stole every scene he was in as per usual. The sidekick and Dominic West were fine but forgettable. The cinematography again signalled a film screw who put significant amounts of concern in to how the film turned out. Yet, for a film about, essentially, a female Indiana Jones, the desire to portray female vulnerability drowned out the moments of indulgent, carefree adventurism and, well... actual tomb raiding. Whilst I am sure I would receive a politically correct backlash for even suggesting it, I can't help but yearn for an Uncharted film to fill the gap that my hopes for this film has left unfilled.",Tomb Raider

No the film is not perfect but neither were the Angelina Jolie's films at all. They were quite cheesy actually although I enjoyed them enough because I like Jolie. This film's storyline is at least a bit more realistic and has coherence. And Alicia Vikander makes an excellent Lara Croft. I know people complained that there was not enough ""tomb raiding"" but this is an origin story, so I'm not sure what they were expecting. I think there are a lot of fanboys out there giving this film a harsh review because either Lara isn't sexy enough or they dont believe a ""regular"" girl could be tough enough to kick some ass.

The first half hour of this movie is useless, poorly thought out and has no place in this movie. Acting is the only decnent part but was let down by the awful script and some really questionable plot holes. There are some parts of this movie where it looks like they just forgot what they were filming, at a few points you'll be screaming at the screen asking why would that happen (and not in a good engaging way). They've half tried to do bits from the game including the over used camera suspense action shot as seen in the trailers. After the 3rd/4th one it gets really grating and shows there is no imagination in this production, poor camera angles and nonsensical attempted suspense editing really dug this movie into a deeper hole.

However, the directors make a fast-food Indiana-Jones-style film. Solving puzzle is a very crucial and important part in Tombraider but the director makes solving puzzle in the film like a fast-food. Lara just solves the puzzle so quick that it just like she already play this puzzle berfore. Another puzzle to stop falling floor is only like a game of guessing. Compared to Indiana Jones, this film make puzzle a cheap game. Most terrible, IMHO, is the illogical things in script. For one example Lara escapes away from the villain team, fall into river, struggle on the rusty abandoned plane, and lastly fall to ground, thanks to the worn parachute. She should be faraway from villain now. But suddenly one of the villain (the one hit by Lu Ren ) coming from nowhere and try to kill her. Another exmaple is Richard is antry about Lara doesn't burn her study stuff cause he wanna protect Lara and the world from the disaster make have if Himiko's body is revealed. Since he should be the only one who might be able to solve and open Himiko's tomb, why he appears before the tomb (also don't know how he came to the door so soon?) and give Vogel the chance to threat Lara by attempting to kill him. lastly, as many blogger said, audiences are expecting a showdown fight between Lara and Death Queen Himiko, but the script, again a cheap fast-food, just make the queen a virus carrier. WTF.
According to the history of Japan, Himatai is a very mysterious kingdom, it supposes the island should be very hard to find out. However, Lara and Lu find it really quick before I can understand why. All of this make me feel the story is full of illogical and fast-food things.Sorry! Too many complaint. Let' get back the positive side. I won't reject a sequel starring Alicia again cause she really did a good job to play Lara's role. I just hope there's a better logical, well-developed-solving-puzzle script .

869,tylermiller1203,"As an fan of the game series, I can't say I'm surprised!",6,25 March 2018,"My rating is actually closer to being a 6.5, which in my eyes places the film at above average. Which is pretty generous in my opinion. I have so much to say about the film, but not enough time to write it all so i'm going to write my blunt opinions about the film and if you want an accurate review on this film watch AngryJoe's review of the film over on YouTube. So my blunt opinion is that the film lacked the charm of the more recent games, which this film is based on those games. It does some stuff right, and if you never played a Tomb Raider game, unlike me who has played almost all of them, then you might enjoy the film a lot more. First off I believe they shouldn't have kept any ties to the 2013 game's plot and the spoilers they put in tied to the 2015 game concerning a certain antagonist. If they wanted a faithful adaption, they should have made it into a TV show, because otherwise your shoving an 8-10 hour game down into less than 2. They messed up on Mathias's character as a result, who never had any ties to Trinity, and actually did believe in the supernatural in the games. In the games he was a major character who transformed Lara into who she is, as her unbelief in the supernatural was often challenged by Mathias, who like Lara's father, believed in the supernatural. In the film Mathias was just some forgettable thug with an army who takes orders from someone else. Plus, the plot twist with Himiko was ridiculous. SPOILERS BEYOND THIS POINT, So if you don't want the ludicrous plot twist with Himiko spoiled, don't read it. In the game, Himiko is referred to as the first and last emperess of Japan. The reason being that she had the power to reincarnate into anyone who was her descendant. I expected that to be mentioned, but it was never brought up. Also, in the game she trapped people on the island because Himiko's rage about her generals betrayal controlled storms which prevented people from leaving the island. None of that was mentioned either. Well it was, but they completely threw it out the window by the end of the film. Instead we find out that Himiko is actually not an evil person but just carried a disease which turned people into zombies. and then there is Trinity's involvement in the film, which bewilders me. In the first game Trinity was only ever mentioned once and you actually had to look for it. But in the film they throw it in your face that they are behind everything and that they want to control the world. Which is somewhat true, at least the part about wanting to control the world. Except in the games Trinity wants to control the world, in order to bring about peace from war. Their goal was to find artifacts which could grant eternal life, because if they could live forever, no one would be able stop them from controlling the world. So what bewilders me, is that if they wanted to bring peace that way in the games, why would the writers behind this film think it was a good idea to make Trinity want a disease which turns people into zombies. That doesn't bring about peace, and it doesn't help you control the world. Trinity isn't the Umbrella Corporation. The film does do a few things right, which I don't have the time to write a review on and it also does a lot more things wrong, but like I said before, watch AngryJoe's review on youtube if you are considering watching this film. Joe does a great job explaining the flaws and strengths of the film into great detail.",Tomb Raider

As a family we played all the games with much love for the character and the concept of the game. Sadly we also watched as the games became worse and worse. The first two movies almost hit the mark but Angelina Jolie was the wrong actress for the job. Should have been Elizabeth Hurley. So sad to watch a fantastic concept ruined when 'the corporates' get involved. So, on to Tomb Raider 2018. First comment - soo slow. Next 15 comments - soo slow. It looks good, even great in places. It looses pace almost immediately and it's downhill from there for me. I can never understand how a director and editor can sit down and watch movies and not fall asleep like I did twice. I don't want to fall asleep watching a movie I should love every second of. Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle was captivating all the way through. Even looked like the computer game it never was. Like the new Star Wars movies, Tomb Raider has to be made by people who completely understand what the story concept is all about. People who grew up along with Lara Croft.

I can watch almost anything and genuinely try to avoid criticising what is essentially people's career but this is shocking and you have to understand how bad something must be for me to actually write this. The reinterpretation has all but lost the games life blood being puzzles etc (oh here's a puzzle whoops ive solved it, don't blink) there's at least 3 world record setting long jumps; I know we all suspend disbelief a bit, that's movies but at one point Lara leaps about 15 metres into water, yet if she'd jumped 2 m would have landed in exactly the same water ???

At least Alicia Vikanders version you can sit through and not shake your head every thirty seconds wondering what the eff is this joke. 
Watching Vikander was seriously like watching a new Indiana Jones film. Coulda been Lara Jones, Indy's daughter. That's the style of movie it is. Basically it's not a video game turned movie.

881,recitovita,It left me wanting more!,8,19 March 2018,"Alicia Vikander is the perfect Lara Croft for this version of Tomb Raider.
She carries this movie with her performance and literally saves the day,
the movie/script is flawed. There are many elements from the games that old- and new Tomb Raider-fans will appreciate, but there's enough to see and experience for non-fans. All-in-all I find this to be the best game-based-movie so far.What I really Loved:
Again: Alicia Vikander..she gave it her all..she IS Lara CroftIt's grounded in realism and really pulls it offGreat action-scene'sGood special effects..both CGI and practicalA good translation of Lara's ""growth"" into becoming the Tomb Raider (adapted from a 15 hour game to a 2 hour movie..). I was impressed with how they managed to make everything plausible..from her physical strength to her combat skills..etc.Himiko: the production design of her grave, the queen and all around it was top-notch.Croft manor looked like it came straight out of the game and it was also reminiscent of the original 90's manor. A treat for real fans.For the first time ever, we see how old and wealthy the Croft family really is. In this movie you see that her family owns a huge business empire that was built on British nobility spanning many generations. It's in the details in some parts, and it's make the story so much richer and believable.Richard Croft: Dominic West looks like he could easily be her father in real-life, so really great casting.. but he also managed to make Richard a believable character. I think it's impressive what he did, 'cause with this script any other actor could've easily turned this Character into a Caricature. Lara finding him after so many years was a great thing: she finally found him after searching for him in so many game iterations..chasing his ghost..and finally got to say goodbye.The guns-and-braid Lara they tease in the final scene of the movie. I loved that they did this. It was definitely a nod to the 90's games and movies...while setting up a possible sequel.I'm a big fan of mysticism, legends, supernatural stuff... but I really liked how they turned the Himiko-curse into a believable and realistic element. Like in the game Lara questions her father's believes and doesn't believe the legend to be real. In this movie she learns there is mostly some realism buried beneath each ancient legend or story. That it turned out to be a very infectious and rapidly acting type of plague.. was a great invention by the script-writer(s). I liked it far better than the supernatural light-beaming, screaming, exploding Himiko from the 2013 game.What I wanted More:
More Tomb(s). There is Tomb Raiding in the third part of the movie. I just wanted more of that.. more time spend with Lara..solving puzzles and mysteries.More Himiko: They showed the back story of the death-queen, but through paintings and narration. I would've loved to have seen a flash-back scene in a luscious japanese palace with beautiful costumes..or something like that.More elements from the game environments. Like in the game, when Lara is attacked by wolves and other animals. It would have been great to see her survive more enemies instead of just Trinity (and the occasional rapids and stormy seas).Walton Goggins: This guy can act. It's a bit sad that he didn't get enough to play with in this script. But he's great where he gets his time to shine.More Croft Manor. We only saw the outside of it mostly.. I wanted to see more.What I really Didn't Like:
Yamatai didn't look like the game version..sadly. In the game the island of Yamatai is dark, mysterious, hauntingly beautiful. They shot the movie in south-africa and I think you can really notice that. It doesn't look like a Japanese island to me at all.The Bike-race. It didn't feel necessary for her to do that..and not for the plot of the movie. Filler.The pack of boys that tries to rob Lara in China. They didn't look dangerous..and it didn't add anything. Filler.Lu Ren: I like Daniel Wu and I think he did a good job playing this part. I just didn't like the character Lu Ren... there's not that much to do for him and if he would've died during the sinking of his boat I wouldn't have missed him for the rest of the movie. I feel like Lu Ren could have replace the character-arc Lara had with her group of friends in the game, but he didn't.Lara crawled out of the ocean after being ship-wrecked and instantly got hit in the head and kidnapped by Trinity. It looked so stupid and far-fetched to me. It would've been better to let her struggle herself into the jungle..and THEN be discovered by trinity.

The movie was kind of boring and cliche at times, I was bored with all the build up, but once Lara begins her adventure it gets more interesting. Its nothing new and revolutionary, as it reminded me of past adventure movies like Indiana Jones or The Mummy, but it was entertaining especially near the end.

Rushed where it shouldn't have been, with a lot of time wasted on... dunno, character build-up - I guess - that failed horribly. Plenty a cliche's to not be disappointed by a sudden spike in creativity.Shallow dialogues with barely anything tying them together. A bouquet smart-pants lines that fail to add to the story, while making the characters seem anything from forgetful to lobotomized or worse.Characters?! Forgettable and bi-dimensional. No villain, no heroes, and barely a reason for any of them to exist, from Lara to Vogel. The main character, while certainly physically fit (and as such with enough potential to be the hero that decades of game titles defined her), fails at pretty much everything she sets to do, from start to finish. No goals, no hobbies, no ideals, no principles - only recklessness. I genuinely hope she wasn't supposed be on the hero's journey trail...Onward, Tomb Raider was a feast of puzzles, the ones here are worse than anything I've ever seen in ages. Not only were the puzzle rooms poorly designed, but the characters did everything they could to make'em even worse by rambling nonsense and acting a lot less smart than they were priding themselves to be.The music was a bit too epic too much of the time for too little a reason. I guess it was there to try and create tension or suspense while the story or the characters weren't bothering to (which is throughout the movie).Special effects weren't horrible, but certainly far from both the standard set by other same genre movies and our times.The movie's a barely palatable smoothie of good things with horrible dosage.",Tomb Raider

I was finding myself getting vested in Lara and caring about her as a character. The story could have been better it seemed to me like the story writer had watched ""Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade"" before writing the story and was like ""man that was so long ago no one will remember that"". Sure some differences were made but so many similarities it's uncanny. The book both fathers wanted to keep away from the enemy that both children pretty much hand delivered to them. The clues in the books to help them both pass the ""trials"". Oh and please someone inform American movie producers to look up local laws before making a movie. The final scene where Lara picks up her jade necklace from the pawnshop in England and notices a gunsafe full of handguns (which is illegal for private citizens in the U.K.) so yeah that wouldn't happen. To me the producers messed up when Lara when back to her father secret office it would have been more fitting for her to find and start using the guns her father used would have been a much stronger storyline and more emotional for the character of Lara.

A great reboot for the franchise!,9,17 March 2018,"The previous Tomb Raider films fell into what I'd call the ""swashbuckling aventure"" category, similar to Indiana Jones, Pirates of the Caribbean or the old James Bond movies. All were fun movies. This new Tomb Raider reboot was very much like the new James Bond reboots in that it was very gritty and realistic (like the 2015 reboot game). Lara Croft was not a superhero/super-spy in this movie, but physically and psychologically she was a fighter and survivor, which made the movie believable. It also reminded me of the Wonder Woman movie because Lara's skills and physical prowess came from hard, hard training and will power. The fight sequences also felt shockingly real and not choreographed. With all of that, the writers, directors and actors still gave the movie heart and humanity.

909,Hydrilus,"Ignore the critics, this Tomb Raider was much better than Jolie's",9,25 March 2018,"I've been a gamer all my life. I was raised on Mario and Super Nintendo before being introduced to the Playstation back in the 90s with games such as Crash Bandicoot and of course, Tomb Raider. So, I am quite familiar with Tomb Raider's roots. When Angelina Jolie had her stint as Lara Croft, people praised it then and I see people still praising it now as the greatest thing ever. They praise it primarily because it was FINANCIALLY successful but as far as the actual story goes, it was, in my opinion, boring, and not at all special. It's only similarity to the games were its title and main character, and it made money because of its star alone. Why explain this? Well, I just want you to understand where exactly my opinion on the new Tomb Raider is coming from, which I felt far surpassed the original.First off, this movie clocks in at around 1hr and 35 minutes excluding credits, which I felt was much too short. By the end, I found myself wanting much more, and I think that's about the biggest complaint I have about the film overall - it was too short.There are two big pieces of the game(s) that they could have easily added another 25-30 minutes with, and those would be (1) the survival aspects of the game (i.e. hunting, gathering resources, intel, etc) which can serve as further character development and lore building around the island, and (2) puzzle solving. There are two basic ""puzzles"" that Lara solves but they're not even close to the same level as what's in the game. I realize it's hard to make an audience sit, watch, and spend as much time on solving puzzles in a film like one would in the game itself, and I'm not asking for 15 minutes to be spent figuring out 1 puzzle, but this aspect could been done much better, as I felt the characters moved through the tomb much too quickly.Acting is top notch. One of the most noticeable changes to the new Tomb Raider games (and actually, many games in general) involves the quality voice-acting done by Camilla Luddington, who voices Lara and is actually the physical model by which Lara's in-game appearance and movements is based on. I was surprised when Alicia Vikander was cast and not Camilla, as Camilla IS Lara Croft in voice and appearance, but Alicia does a marvelous job bringing Lara to life in the same way Camilla has in the games. Specifically, I'm referring to the myriad of grunts, gasps, screams and cries that Lara emits throughout the game every time she falls, is punched, scraped, cut, shot at, etc... Some might say this is the most annoying part of the games but I think it's one of the best parts because it makes the whole experience much more real. In real life, when someone gets hurt, and/or is physically exerting themselves, they make noise! Far too often in video games and films, characters are unrealistically quiet when taking a beating, whether it be from a person or the environment. This is not so with Tomb Raider. Alicia Vikander must have taken notice of how the games handled Lara's audio and mimics the game audio perfectly. She makes you feel every hit she takes with various grunts and gasps and cries tailored specifically to whatever it is she's suffering. As I mentioned before, the audio is one of the best parts of the game and in the film, I'd say it's at the same level.How about visuals? Mostly well filmed, well designed sets. The minor distractions include those where obvious CGI was needed to accomplish the scene, which involves mainly water effects not being totally convincing, but it's one scene out of many and doesn't ruin the film at all. There is a whole lot more that's real in this film than not real, which is something to really appreciate in this day and age.Plot? Except for the introduction, the plot essentially resembles that of the game. I see some people have complained that the movie didn't go out on the limb and do its own thing, saying that they found it boring and predictable but, as a fan of the games myself, I didn't find it boring or predictable at all. As a fan of the games, I went into the film knowing more about what to expect than the average viewer, and still came out wonderfully entertained and wanting more. I think that says something, but obviously, I am just one fan.Overall, I really hope you ignore the critics and give this film a chance. It's got some funny parts, but isn't too funny, it's serious, but doesn't take itself too seriously, and most of all, it maintains a realistic and believable feel to it. What I mean by that is, Alicia, as Lara, looks and acts like someone who can handle herself, and who can really do the things you're seeing on-screen. There was only one scene near the end that stretched my belief a little, but everything else, she is convincing with her actions and accomplishments with nothing too over the top (i.e. like stunts in Fast and Furious movies...). It's biggest fault was that it was too short - I was wanting a lot more at the end, and if it could have been longer, I would have loved for them to have spent more time on the survival aspects of Lara and the puzzle solving. I am seriously looking forward to a sequel if this one does well enough!",Tomb Raider

But I was pleasantly surprised, in terms of action/ adventure movies there was nothing worse than any of them would have. The main difference I found was that the heroine was a smart young women that didn't have a romantic interest nor become naked or sexualised throughout the movie. She was strong and smart and treated as a person. She wasn't super sexy or super cheerful which I think most men would have gone into it expecting this and that's where some of the disappointments would lie. But it's the first movie I've ever watched being a 24 yr old female where a character of similar age and appearance is strong and capable without being sexualised or made to stand around pulling poses and I loved it!

What made the reboot video game so popular that we could see a human Lara with insecurities and a psychological evolution of her, her struggles, her pain with her boundaries, persistance and not like a super wonder unrealistic woman. That is why I don't understand so many want to see a super Lara. Alicia Vikander was perfect for this role. The CGI is awesome. Though what was in the long video game, you cannot implement all into a movie. The half of the movie is great. Then with the island and the tomb and the rest of the movie left with the feeling with: that was all? They focused on one location and the movie ended.

917,enggar_13,Forgettable and Predictable,6,7 March 2018,"TOMB RAIDER review (No Spoilers)
Alicia is very different Lara Croft. While Angelina Jolie is very charismatic, sexy, clever, and skillful Lara Croft (in short she is over the top /overpowered version of Lara Croft), Alicia is more grounded, skinny, cry baby, miserable with daddy issue. She is the weak (very UN-Lara Croft) version of Lara Croft and she does not use guns! (it's like Batman without gadgets WTF?!) It's just dumb and hollow action movie. 
Movie should have escapism element on it. So it should not be very realistic n logic, specially a movie based on video game like this one. We have to live in this movie's world/universe, so we would not get distracted by illogical acts or scenes (it keeps us entertained). BUT there are so many scenes that makes me thinking ""wait, why she does that?"", ""why she..wait what?!"" etc. It does not make sense and stupid. 
The story is simple and cliche. It's like mash-up of scenes from many movies. Very predictable and forgettable at the same time. It's 5.5/10 for me.",Tomb Raider

The story of the game that it is based on has been butchered, and for some reason they mixed up the final reveal of Himiko with the exact same one from Uncharted 1 where they open up the tomb and find that the corpse has some kind of disease capable of turning people into zombies.Just another failure in the long line of crappy video game movies.",Tomb Raider

921,Sir_Swish,A great origin story beginner for the franchise,7,18 March 2018,"A good start to the new reboot franchise.Clearly they wanted to focus on her current turmoil with the loss of her dad. It would however have been nice to elaborate more on the reason why she's shunned her grandiose family home and lifestyle to become a college dropout/minimum wage earner. They also don't elaborate a whole lot on her strife with Anna and any mention of her biological mother. I also felt they could have focused more on her coming to terms with killing for survival and hardening up. She felt fully capable right from the beginning, when chartering the vessel. Only the drowning of the soldier really touched her significantly.The supporting characters seemed a bit weak and more of just half-hearted necessities. However, the key characters, Lara, Richard and Vogel were all very well delivered.The overall story is based on the 2013 Tomb Raider game reboot and follows the story fairly closely. The final twist is pretty obvious and deliberately sets up for a sequel.Overall a good movie, it would have been much better if it hadn't sold out and tamed down the rawness, realism and grittiness of a survival movie, so as to target a wider appropriate audiences. If this movie had been rated 16 with Lara taking much more visual damage and hardening to survive, it would have been superb.",Tomb Raider

This movie perfectly matches what I always envisioned the spirit of Lara Croft to be. The result is an adventure worthy of the likes of indiana jones, with added realism. Angelina Jolie's movies were great, but like the last instalments of the video game, this movie better depicts what a grand adventure like this does to its heroes.

927,bsus1412,"A decent Video-Game adaptation, but a failure as a film",6,14 March 2018,"SPOILERS AT THE END!!!I was lucky enough to get a pre-screening of this film before it officially opened, and as a fan of the original games, I must say that I felt that this movie was lacking in many ways. The movie starts off well-enough, with an excellent view of Lara growing up and engaging in rebellious activities that still feels grounded in the real world. Sadly, once she learns of her father's legacy, she's off to China and the plot seems to want to never seriously hurt her in any of the following scenes. She maneuvers through Hong Kong as a clueless tourist in such a way that I instantly knew that this movie would make sure that she never comes into real danger, as the worst people she runs into as a white foreigner with no Chinese ability in a run-down harbor is a trio of boys who steal her backpack. Every character's introduction is designed to move the plot further around her and her only. I had so many questions about the world around Lara and the mysterious corporation that funded Vogel's expedition, but the only details revealed were the ones that specifically pertained to the ""action"" scenes revolving around Lara. I use ""action"" generously, because despite the many repeated images of her grimacing in pain, she clearly remained at the level of an Olympic athlete throughout the film despite the serious injuries she sustained. If they were really trying to make this movie convincing, the filmmakers should have let her injuries actually impede her in some way, instead of being ignored because of Plot. 
SPOILERS FROM HERE ON OUT!!!
There were so many missed opportunities here. Much of the cast was pulled from Into the Badlands, but the action scenes here were lacking in comparison to the TV series. In addition, most of the dialogue during the last quarter of the film was extremely generic, and felt derivative of every action film that came out since 1997. The light puzzle and various traps had the appropriate video game characteristic that was necessary for this film, but the games had better twists than what I saw in Tomb Raider. One example of a suggested improvement would be if the zombified father came back to help Lara fight Vogel. As it was, I predicted the virus plot-point right from the start of the film, and was disappointed with how derivative they made the scene be. EMBRACE THE VIDEO GAME. I hate to say it, but Angelina Jolie's films had the right idea in that it's okay to be a little silly at times if you're creating a video-game adaptation. Just enjoy yourself while doing it, and the movie will work itself out in the end. As it was, I just saw this film as one big action-movie cliche instead of the faithful adaptation that it could have been.",Tomb Raider

929,DarkEagle25,The wait is FINALLY over!,7,16 March 2018,"After all these years, Hollywood bringing to life so many game adaptations, but almost all of these movies failed miserably. And now, in 2018, the director, Roar Uthaug and Alicia Vikander made THE best game adaptation. Of course, the movie plot is still simple and predictable BUT, don't forget the fact: The Tomb Raider games was never more than that! This movie is FUN, packed with good action, the visuals are great also the music. Most importantly, Alicia Vikander is Lara Croft! I follow her carrier from the beginning, so I knew she's an amazing actress, but still, her performance is blow me away!In this movie, the villain is not just some random dude, who want's to rule the world. He has some good and solid opinions why he do what he do. Walton Goggins performance is top notch as always. The one thing I missed is he's relationship with he's family. I think with some more backstory he could be more relatable character.The father-daughter relationship was well written, but they used that flashback scene too much, I think. I don't wanna tell more because that will be a spoiler but if you curious, Dominic West was great and he's character had some good development.And the last thing I've missed is, more Daniel Wu scenes with more character development. I hope, when they make a sequel, they will bring him back some more action.Lastly, if you wanna see some copy paste game adaptation, or just want to see boobs, this is not your movie. BUT, if you like fun and thrilling movies with good drama, than, go and watch Tomb Raider!BEST game adaptation EVER!",Tomb Raider
930,cat_fan_14,Solid Adaptation,7,10 April 2018,"Hollywood often disappoints viewers with shoddy adaptations of books and games, however Tomb Raider is pretty solid.
I was pleased with how we see her at the beginning of her story. She is going on a journey of self discovery. The begining is really solid in making its own story about Lara Croft. The over all story is well done even if it pulls a little to heavily from its video game counter parts the further we go into the movie. It deviates enough in some good ways that it is something I would recommend people to see if they've got nothing going on. It does its job in being entertaining. Would I pay to see it in theaters again? Probably not. Was it worth seeing it in theaters once? Totally.",Tomb Raider
931,cat_fan_14,Solid Adaptation,7,10 April 2018,"I have always loved Tomb Raider, the games and the previous movies. This is my favorite movie adaptation of the games though.
Lara Croft has always been a consistent character even through her few reboots. She remains someone who has an analytical mind and enjoys adventure and learning. I loved seeing her at the start of becoming what we all already know her to be; how she grows into the Tomb Raider.
The movie does a fair job of making the latest video game reboots its own story, for about the first twenty-five minutes. After that it pulls heavily from the two video games, not a bad thing, I personally would have like to see more of a companion story rather than a retelling of what I already know from playing the games. If I hadn't played the games I don't think this would be an issue to me, the story still flows nicely.
Over all even with the few issues I had with it, its an enjoyable experience. It was entertaining and fun and serious in the right spots. Worth seeing it in theaters? Totally. Would I see it again in theaters? Probably not.",Tomb Raider

There were some great looking scenes with an original touch to it. And let's not forget the beauty of Alicia Vikander. Although this movie was clearly laying the ground work for a future picture. So I left the movie with a little tomb raid hole in me. There was just not allot of raiding and solving puzzles. But i expect this all to come in the later installment.

The trailers also looked intriguing and got me excited. What I was served was something completely different than the games that had so much dazzle, excitement, beautiful scenery and mystery. This movie focuses heavily on action scenes that are well made throughout but the story falls flat towards the end. Yamatai is nothing like in the game. The crazy religious super villain Mathias is not that villainous in the movie and is just a family man that has been pushed over the edge. Vikander plays well and the movie is nicely choreographed, but the story writers need to look for something else to do!",Tomb Raider

945,Posterblurb,Ugh,1,2 June 2018,"Cousin and I grew up watching the Jolie Tomb Raider films and played the really old PC games bought and owned by our uncle. We still rewatch the two movies with fondness and nostalgia, for the sake of our younger cousins who've never seen it or were too young to remember it. Having seen the trailer for this one, I was apprehensive at first because I don't really like Vikander for irrational reasons, but my cousin convinced me to go. We went to a practically empty theatre. Just us and a couple of senior citizens.Summary of our movie experience:
Me: How old is she supposed to be in this movie? I must've missed it. (They kept repeating Mr. Croft went missing 7 years ago, but the flashbacks keep showing a little girl who could be 11 years at most, so Lara's supposed to be 18??)Cousin: *every other 10min, starts muttering to herself or whisper-hisses at me* That's not Lara.Me: *stops paying attention after 'Lara' needs help figuring out the code to her dad's journal*Cousin: *hisssssss*Here's a list of things that ticked us off:
1) Movie says NotLara is 'independent'. She won't touch her dad's money because she won't accept his death. Or something like that. Our take is that she could've used said resources to educate herself, and use it to look for her dad. Her pride made her stupid.
2) Movie says NotLara is 'realistic'. I guess Cuz and I were just too attached to the old Lara who had weapons training, knew multiple languages, was a history buff, elegant and badass but sensitive at the same time. This NotLara is 'real' because she loses fights, has a blue-collar job, is scared and shows it, cries. This type of character would have worked for any other movie, but as cuz likes to say: She's not Lara Croft!
3. What the hell, NotLara?? You needed the hot hungover dude to give you a clue to solve the code?? Looking back at the old Tomb Reader movies, it's the first film I remember watching that had the Female Gaze. Sure, Jolie was hella hot, but I loved that the audience gets to check out her male side-kicks with her. TL;DR-- Uuuuugh.",Tomb Raider
946,cliffcovenant75,A Video Game Movie with Heart!,8,16 August 2018,"This film surpasses by miles the usual superficial cliched movie adaptions of video games. Instead of a one dimensional ""cardboard cutout"" of a movie the character of Lara Croft is given heart and depth. In fact the story has so much emotional appeal that it caught me completely by surprise. The other characters are believable and real. I was seriously not expecting much but within 1/2 an hour I was totally invested in the film's tone. Compared to Joli's previous interpretation of Lara Croft Vikander portrays the character with an intense sincerity and innocence. Even though Croft made her debut as a video game heroine which one does not expect to be very realistic it just works better in the medium of film to develop her character more. When you play a video game you concentrate on the action and winning but when watching a story unfold on film focus is split between the action and the character arcs. This film gets the balance right. You can have fun while also really feeling for Lara and her father. Joli and Voight came across as arrogant and pretentious by comparison.on the same roles.",Tomb Raider

I've seen over 10,00 Movies over the last 50 Years & this is my Current Top-20. It is a Suspend Reality & Enjoy the Ride type Movie & It was a wonderful journey. Vikander surpassed the Jolie version & now owns the role in my books. Ignore those with political agenda's who vote HIGH or LOW ratings in an attempt to sway other to their own views.

Yeah, I am all about action, but in the trailers, she whines and sounds like a 12 year-old and tries too hard to sound and act like a badass; so that left me grateful that Angelina Jolie did it first and I enjoy LISTENING AND WATCHING her much better.

Only god knows, why they decided to skip this draft and replace it by a totally uninspired typical superhero origin. Best comparison is I guess with Arrow Season 1 without the charming and campy characters with some bits of the everywhere beloved Iron Fist.To show her street smartness, she is depicted as a bike courier and outsmart a bunch of colleagues. So just 30 minutes later she nearly sacrifice her stuff openly to some wannabe street robbers. It also never get really clear why the holding is running out of money just because her dad is not officially declared dead as Lara does not want to sign the papers and prefers to live in poverty. I could go on and on with the stupid decisions, but then I would need to recap the whole movie. In the end it just massively fails, even the final sequel baiting (which I guess already 50% of the people reading this can already guess right now correctly) fails as the movie failed to build any tension for this.",Tomb Raider

960,BadOpinions,Straightforward movie gets a medium rating.,6,4 April 2018,"I like to enjoy movies for what they try to be. An action movie gets rated on my enjoyment and recognition of its action. Dramas for drama and character. Comedy for humor etc. 
The best films are true to what they aim to be and know when to break their own rules. The 2018 Tomb Raider features the wonderful (I'm biased) Alicia Vikander as our young, intelligent, well-funded heroine with daddy issues. Vikander does not look the part for the role and as such is poorly cast visually. However, she was the brightest spot in the film for me. Based on the reboot game from 2013, this version of Lara was going to be a bit more naive and is not callused towards what it takes to survive.To that effect, Vikander does a great job at portraying a more sensitive Croft.There are some very enjoyable action scenes in here, but they are few and far between. I enjoyed Lara and the moments of action enough to want to stick through the film, but I went in wanting to like it. Every other character I had zero amount of care for and I wouldn't even be able to reflect on the plot a week from now if I didn't consider the changes made from the game immediately after seeing the film. Tomb Raider doesn't try to do anything new. It does an O.K. job as an action film with some thrown in jokes that don't land and most of the best scenes already in the trailers. All in all it is everything we should have thought it was going to be - an action flick that isn't terrible and isn't all that amazing either.

The cast is so talented and handpicked for their respective roles, that you will never feel bored while you're watching the film. The movie of course is based on the 2013 reboot of the videogame series but if you are a fan of the classic videogames you will catch a lot of cool references from the past and present, and all of them never feel out of place. There are references to the classic Tomb Raider games, to the 2013 reboot series and even to the original Angelina Jolie movies.Walton Goggins gives an amazing performance as the villain in this movie, Mathias Vogel. He is dark, evil and really entertaining to watch. Dominic West steals your heart in this film, I won't go into detail, but most of his scenes are really powerful. Daniel Wu is the funny and badass sidekick to our main hero and in a matter of minutes you will sympathize and care for him in a big way,And finally, Alicia Vikander. To all the people that said Alicia wasn't Lara Croft, you all should swallow your words and apologize. Alicia gives the best performance in this film by far, she is the Lara Croft we have all been waiting for.

Yes, I do believe some scenes from the game should have been in this movie. I do wish there would have been more characters from the game. But I do believe they didn't want to add more runtime.

965,kdecker-27923,The gun goes off but the movie forgets to run,7,20 March 2018,"I took my daughter to see Tomb Raider since we are both fans of the video game reboot. Our opinions matched pretty well. We knew that this was an origin story and that it was going to show Lara's journey to becoming the epic Tomb Raider. We expected some growth throughout the movie. However, we also expected Lara Croft to already have some self-confidence and bravado from the get-go. I know its meant to be more realistic than Angelina's turn in the role, but seriously, she is a super-hero, not Indiana Jones. This is a character that does swan dives off 90-foot cliffs, switches ziplines mid-flight, and goes toe-to-toe with burly Sailors. I get that they needed to set the missing Father-figure angle, but that aspect did not need to take so much time in the movie. I don't know if the director thought we would be more emotionally invested in Lord Croft's story, but most people who are going to the movie already know the outcome. Showing her growth and learning is great, but to make a movie out of an adventure video game, there needs to be more adventure. In my opinion, Lara needed to step into her power and be the hero sooner. The actress did do a good job with the action sequences she did have. I think if they can pull of a sequel she is going to be perfect.",Tomb Raider

She could perfectly fits the game plot....could.Changes in the original game plot begins when there are two people in the boat, instead of the original number in game. This was not a problem, until Lara reaches the island.The game ending shows Mathias as the evil character. Why the movie brought him as the killer of Lara's father right in the beginning? When you think that it couldn't get worse, Lara finds his dad. What is his role in the island(???????)? From this to the end, it's a completely disrespectful plot for all the gamers who played the game. If the changes were even good....Samantha Nishimura was literally excluded from this movie while she co-stars the game. Lara's friends were essential to build her personality during the game, and also it was excluded.Also, Lara unique scene reaching a tower to send a SOS signal was excluded. It had such photography potential......what to say about the island? It is so amazing when its atmosphere gets scary when Lara and her friends try to get out of the island.Maybe next time it would be better to put a gamer closer to the movie project.....My recommendation is: if you liked the movie, go and play the game right away....see what it could be.",Tomb Raider

Especially Alicia Vikander. Now, time for everything elseThis film is, in one word, boring. The plot is predictable following a strict formula to the letter, and Lara, the main character, the one we're supposed to root for and watch grow and develop, is a Mary Sue. As in, she doesn't really change as a character from beginning to end. This really severs my connection to the character, as she's more of a plot device than anything. Not caring about any of the characters is honestly the main reason why the film is a pain to sit through. I can't tell you anything about them because they're so incredibly forgettable.

I wish this followed the 1st game more, where are all the characters from the game!? Jonah especially. I gotta admit when the actress for Lara was cast, I was immediately gutted. I personally don't think she looks like Lara Croft. Angelina Jolie looks more like her but I get they needed a younger actress. This girl isn't her though. I do wish they kept the film more like the game as the game is amazing and the review scores say that. If you enjoy the rebooted games then I doubt you will like this movie but each to their own.Gutted. I really wanted to like this movie.",Tomb Raider
987,gumdum,could be improved,7,10 March 2018,"This film totally got a lot of potential. The thing is the production are ignoring some small thing that someone like me trying to find. there are too much scene that does not make sense. for example there is this moments wen a 7 years old handycam left could instantly be used. Another thing that could be improved is the initial stories about lara croft, in the initial of the stories she was't some super badass girl or stuff. she just train kickboxing but in jungle somehow she could take a trained private army even with holes in her stomach. she does not have superheroes power okay so make her like an ordinary super tough girl.Somehow i dont find vikander look badass enough to be lara. i believe she just need to buff up a little bit. gain some muscle.but the stories totally nice. it got very good climax, plot twist and suprise moment not like current typical superheroes movies. the cinematography and graphic is amazing even though i find the way lara run was a little bit odd but someone told me that it was intentionally make to be like that, to look like lara in the games. the sound is amazing, the music is nice.overall this film is amazing an it still could be improved.",Tomb Raider

So I was excited to see a reboot of the movie series. However, my excitment soon turned to loathing. The movie should have never been made. It was a disgrace to the legend of Lara Croft and I hope that it cost the movie studio enough money that the next in this dismal reboot is never made.

Yes, the film had some other twist and an almost completly different story but I didn't got any feelings from the scenes. I would say it was just plain boring. Or maybe it's just me, having too many expectations for a game inspired film.The title says 'Tomb Raider' but the tomb part is actually forgotten most of the times.

A bit Raiders of the Lost Ark (ish) with the puzzles in the tomb and the twist was very well worked.

Vikander is the boring revamped boyish Lara who mumbles her way through the performance .Perhaps a better dialect coach in future if she wants to play a Brit. The character is not intelligent at all despite being called bright by everyone..She has money troubles didn't attend university and does very stupid things that could get her and others killed ,despite being an heiress she pawns her only gift from her father rather than getting a loan from the estate... She ignores the directive by her father to burn his work and precedes to the island of ""certain death"" and straight scenes from the games including some from Uncharted are recreated but less exciting. blah blah blah escapes....sees bigger plot unfolding than ends....Also Like Indiana Jones/Uncharted and Tomb raider games the supernatural is a LARGE element..why is everyone in Hollywood SCARED of FAITH outside of a horror movie context?As with other game movies ..what the director ,script writers and producers forget is that the STORIES are already there within the games .Just take one of them and make it better not worse!!.This Lara isn't a Lady at all.

This is the best video game adaptation to movie of Tomb Raider. When her power of attorney convinces her to come take over her fathers assets. she is handed a puzzle piece that leads here to her first clue. The picture quality is great and the sound is great. Our new heroine Alicia Vikander does a great job as Lara Croft. I hope to see more of her in the future Tomb Raider Titles.

Stallone was a big strong guy playing RAMBO so it was credible but having such a little woman do what RAMBO does it's ridiculous even if you suspend disbelief as usual with feminist Hollywood movies.

1000,jupseyjude,A thoroughly enjoyable video-game adaptation FINALLY,7,19 March 2018,"After only watching one film last week and therefore only being able to do one review; I made to change that over the last weekend and have since watched a grand total of four films, that I will be reviewing over the course of this forthcoming week. What is this about? Lara Croft (Alicia Vikander) is a young and fiercely independent woman, who chooses to battle for herself, rather than take advantage of the vast inheritance left behind by her missing father. That is until she is given an ultimatum: sign for her father's company and all of it's assets or let them be sold off. What she soon finds when following the trail left behind by her father, is something she never could have imagined, there was more to his life than just ""boardrooms and business deals"". Lara knows that she must finish what he started; but how much will it cost her? And, will she make it back alive? What are people's general thoughts about this film? Films based on a video-games always seem to draw a collective groan from critics and fans alike, as every time they just don't seem to get it right. Michael Fassbender, Vikander's other half, starred in a truly terrible adaptation of the very popular video-game series Assassin's Creed last year. It seems that Vikander has come back this year to redeem the pair. However, based on lukewarm ratings on IMDb at only 6.9/10, a very poor rotten tomatoes score at 49% and past experience with Hollywood in general, I admit I wasn't particularly optimistic. But I wanted nothing more than for this film to prove me wrong and show me there is something to be said for this genre. What did I think? Positives- I must start be saying that I found myself enjoying this film an awful lot more than I imagined I would because: Alicia Vikander is fantastic- I think she has really dug her teeth into this role because although most of the stuff happening was truly fantastical her acting remained serious and focused. There are scenes throughout the film, and I don't know whether it is intentional or not, that feel like part of a video game. Finally, I thought that her robotic run was just something she was doing for 'Ex Machina' but it turns out that this is just the way that she runs. The action is very actiony- Sometimes in these films they try and be too smart and leave out action sequences in place of little nuances that are lost on almost everyone. Let's be honest what we all really want from a film like this is a good build of tension and lots of action and I'm pleased to announce this film has both. I liked the backstory- I thought it set up film well and I really liked the fox and the hound idea. The plot twists were intriguing- A key event that happened in this film happened and was quite a shock to the audience but the reason I liked it as much as I did was because it wasn't revealed in the trailer. Nowadays key plot points are released in the trailer more and more often. For example in the Thor Ragnorak trailer the fact that Thor fights Hulk is released in the trailer. WHY COULDN'T IT JUST BE LEFT TO THE FILM? Anyway this film managed that well so well done. Negatives- I feel like what was wrong with this film was definitely in the minority but there is no doubt things were wrong. At points the plot is just completely preposterous and makes no sense at all. The main example of this is the ladder scene at the end. Why on earth did she kick the ladder off before she got where she needed to? Moreover, it is quite clichéd but as it's a Hollywood blockbuster I wasn't at all surprised. Finally, when Daniel Wu shouts ""Go Lara"" it is absolutely pathetic and the only reason it didn't completely detach me was because I was expecting it from the trailer. Conclusion- I really enjoyed this film and sometimes that is all you need. Therefore I am happy to concede that I was wrong and there is something to be said for the genre. BUT, from the overwhelmingly mediocre response it has received I am worried that a sequel won't be coming. My Rating- 8/10 Please have a look at my film reviews at judesfilmreviews.com",Tomb Raider
1001,CTletsmakethishappen-9462,"As a video game adaptation, this is near perfection.",9,7 March 2018,"As a movie, it's close to a 7, but a very entertaing one. As a video game adaptation, this will probably be a huge step in the right direction. Alicia was the right pick for this role; the villain was somewhat lackluster, but they all seem like that in modern day blockbusters, so no problem on that end. Overall, a very enjoyable movie that should've been released in the summer, but I don't regret seeing it sooner.",Tomb Raider
1002,sushant-82326,It's OK,5,17 March 2018,"Soooo...The villains were after a mystic weapon that turned out to be a coffin with an ancient corpse that contained a virus that turned people into murderous rage zombies.AKA Uncharted 1.Whoever wrote this movie doesn't seem to grasp Lara's character at all. In this movie, Lara is just a girl who happens to be fit and athletic and also knows a bit of history and problem solving. She didn't go to school and doesn't seem to have a natural fascination for the arqueologies. The only reason she goes to the island in the first place is to see if her dad is alive (which is a whole other problem but we'll get to that later). Lara Croft (at least the reboot version which this movie is inspired by) is supposed to be a college graduate that goes to the island for the sole purpose of exploring. Movie Lara doesn't seem to be interested in exploring at all. Even at the end of the movie it's implied the only reason she'll keep going around the world is to stop Trinity and not to raid tombs. I think stripping her of her innate curiosity does a huge disservice to her character. She's a tomb raider by name only.The supporting cast of the game is missing entirely from this movie. Instead we get an asian drunk sailor who also happens to be excellent at firing guns and taking out nameless goons. Interesting characters like Sam, Reyes, Roth, and Jonah are replaced all by him.Himiko is not a witchy supernatural entity like in the game, instead she's just a corpse carrying a disease. I think having something actually supernatural would've been more interesting.Her dad being alive was not a good decision in my opinion. I think it would've been better to let Lara accept her father died and make her move on as a character. Maybe her father dying would've inspired her to take an interest in arqueology? I don't know. I think her dad works best dead.Overall, the whole time, I felt like I was watching a YouTube compilation of videogame cutscenes, with some walkthrough sequences thrown in. And after Assassin's Creed...I'm okay with that",Tomb Raider

What I loved personally about this film is that it gave us a heroine who was a little bit more relatable and a little bit more realistic. I had imagined the new Lara to be this absolute bad ass who was not afraid of anything and was the absolute best at everything she did but instead we got a real human woman who *yes* is still very much a bad ass but doesn't start out that way. She gets stronger and stronger as the film progresses which to me made the film that much more enjoyable.I've always been a fan of the bad ass woman: Underworld, Resident Evil, Kill Bill and even the original Tomb Raider to name a few and at first I will admit that i was a little disappointed that our new Lara wasn't the best from the second the movie started but what we got from her was even more incredible.I enjoyed the fighting scenes a lot more because of the reality of them and Alicia Vikander (who was already a favorite of mine) has yet again won me over with her impeccable acting.",Tomb Raider

1013,xanderdesignstudios,A poor ripoff,1,13 April 2018,"So, i just came back from the cinema and i must say i was highly dissapointed in this movie. First of all the actress Alicia Vikander is not fit for this role, instead i wish they could use the original voice actress behind Tomb Raider and Rise of the Tomb Raider - Camilla Luddington, which could give a plus in terms of voice and look familiarity towards the videogame fans. The characters feel empty, without any life, just like reading through the script and that's allThen we talk about the plot, it's somehow a mix between the first and second scenarios of the rebooted game, but to note, there was no Trinity in the first game, she went on an expedition with her crew.I was really dissapointed that they didn't gave a damn about 22 years of Tomb Raider and her father was apparently alive in the movie.I was expecting Himiko to be a super natural phenomenon just like in-game, not some old mummy carrying an upgraded ebola virus. 
Letting all these aside, the movie has a flat and predictable action, Lara seems not to encounter any artifacts on the way, neither seems to be interested into history or archeology, the movie is basically ""finding daddy"" .I really regret watching this movie, and i hope the movie industry and games industry will never cross paths again in this universe.All i hope now is that Shadow of the Tomb Raider will erase the bad experience with the movie.",Tomb Raider

1015,chrisma-88216,Finally a video game adaptation is not a total copy and paste style,9,8 April 2018,"Tomb Raider is the first movie based on a video game that's actually good.Video game adaptations are famously cursed. Though some movies have their fans, critics generally agree that all of them are bad, just to different degrees. Now we might have a good one.This new version stars Alicia Vikander as Croft, the heiress to a financial empire. Her father disappeared seven years earlier. And since Croft refuses to believe he's dead, she won't sign the papers that would allow her to inherit his vast fortune.When she finally changes her mind, her attorney hands her one last gift from her father. Vikander realizes it's a clue about his whereabouts, and that he led a secret life raiding tombs. Lara realizes that she, too, is, uh, destined to raid tombs, and she searches for him on the cursed Japanese island of Himiko.It's not going to be a classic action movie, but the ""Tomb Raider"" reboot works. Lara Croft has a thing for lifting curses.Alicia Vikander nails the role as a teen Lara Croft stepping out her first expedition.A previous Oscar winner for her role in 2016's ""The Danish Girl,"" Vikander is an effective, tough actress, even when the script isn't up to her talent. Her portrayal is in a more natural and grounded way. You can feel her pain and struggling through her scream and moan (which is natural when human suffering from pain).Some of the action scenes are breathtaking.
There's a fun bike race early in the movie, and the film isn't shy about making punches look like they hurt, instead of just bouncing off a person. And there's one sequence in particular where Croft, nearly meeting her death, saves herself by latching onto and climbing through a collapsing airplane.As for Lara Croft herself, Vikander is great in the role. The script doesn't exactly succeed in giving her a lot of depth, but Vikander still gives it her all.",Tomb Raider
1016,samwong-74376,Alicia Vikander as young Lara brings the reboot story to life,9,8 April 2018,"This year's Tomb Raider - 2018 pulls the entire IP together with a totally believable Lara Croft. Brilliantly acted, this rendition took the time to flesh out Lara with an updated backstory and character arc that is touching and heartfelt.Gone are the campy villains of previous cinematic portrayals. Lara faces a truly desperate psychopath in her quest to discover the fate of her father. She gathers friends and allies that support the story admirably. Gone is the pandering body padding. Instead, we are treated to an athletic protagonist capable of meeting the physical challenges that confront her.
Reckless, vulnerable, ambitious, independent, charismatic, and a little naive, Alicia Vikander as young Lara brings her origin story to life. Without pulling punches (literally), this movie magically incorporates both classic and contemporary game memes with a Lara who redefines today's vibrant female hero.And it's got action, puzzles, and pathos with a mere touch of humor.

I mean really Why 1 out 10!!! I am bringing back balance to this under rated film.To me a 1 out of 10 film is ridiculously badly acted, poorly scripted, absolutely terrible effects, absolutely vacuous of any enjoyable content and lacks any kind of cinematic artform. That isn't this film at all. Its no work of art either but is executed well and flows along nicely enough to take me along with it.Alicia Vikander does well in this action movie and i think she could have brought so much depth to the character if given the chance.At the end of the day, Its a film.

The ending makes it obvious they are planning on follow up movies. For their sake, I hope Lara reaches puberty before then.All that aside, the movie was very predictable, following the usual Hollywood sequence of events.

I saw it as an alternate origin story, similar to the first Tomb Raider game in the new series, showing a determined but scared Lara, embarking on her first adventure. I feel like with video game movies, you're always going to get mixed reviews. People want it to be the same as the games but also just different enough and everyone has a certain way they would like the movie to be. I thought this was a fun time.

1036,mikisske,This story is not about the actual Lara Croft known by all fans.,2,10 February 2021,"Lara is a tough woman, she is amazing.
The actors and actresses were good no doubt about it.
Obviously the game got a reboot (with a stupid bow, no guns, no knowledge, but learning languages by kicking boxes and a talentless girl who has to each time learn what a bow is and how to jump, but knows how to teleport), but still, the dad is (and was) DEAD in every scenario, there was never a story that said otherwise.
This ""Tomb Raider"" movie looks fresh and amazing and is very well done, but it is a Tomb Raider movie only up to the point where her dad is mentioned and then even showed alive. What a mess.HE IS NOT ALIVE. The father should have been dead all the way through the film.Not trying to be heartless, but that is just how the story always has been, and I am a huge Tomb Raider fan who bought and played every single game, read many comics, watched the first movies and was looking forward to this title.
Such a dissapointment.
It could have ended better without that father being there (especially for that short amount of time, espacially again only to then sacrifice himself blasting a grenade and then it happened in such an over dramatized manner just to get that 2-3 minutes extra in the film, for me that was the happiest moment that he was gone for good),
It's just stupid.

1038,u-77757,Lara Croft-The Return!,10,17 June 2021,"Contrary to the expectations of many, the main problem of the film was not Alicia Vikander, in the role of Lara Croft, but the desire of incompetent screenwriters to please both fans and ordinary viewers.It turned out straight, let's say, so-so. The resulting mix of scenes from the 2013 game and your own ideas is hardly a complete story. A cool idea with a homeless person in London, Lara, in 20 minutes turns into a sloppy tracing paper from all the films and games of the adventure genre.The film, which positions itself on the game, is very defiant about the original source, throwing out almost all the characters from the story, leaving only Lara and her father, as well as Mathias and Lara's stepmother, Anna from Rise of the Tomb Raider. Instead of the crew of the ship Endurance, there is only one drinking Chinese, who turns into almost Rambo in the final.I would like to praise the action scenes and tombs, but because of the inadequate camera behavior and cheap special effects, they do not cause delight.But what really succeeded in the film is Miss Croft herself, played by the Swedish actress, Alicia Vikander. Despite all the skepticism, this role suited her perfectly. Vikander is equally adept at playing both an extreme woman in the slums of London, and a courageous warrior who is ready to risk her life for her father. You can reproach her for her lack of emotions, but I really don't want to.The finale of the film throws out an unexpected twist, hinting at a sequel it would be very interesting to see Alicia again in this role, provided that the screenwriters change and a more interesting interpretation of the video game, because the potential of the franchise is huge, especially in such a narrow genre as adventure movies, not so many films are released.",Tomb Raider
1039,s-33751,Are games going to change the cinema?,10,17 June 2021,"In the spotlight: Tomb Raider: Lara Croft.For a long time, movies based on computer games could never pass the most difficult and merciless final boss - the CRITIC. Hitman, Warcraft, Assassin's creed-these are just some of the defeated films. Even Resident Evil, with its quite decent first part, succumbed to the temptation and thus made a fatal mistake, deciding to pass this boss as many as 5 times.In turn, Lara Croft could also join the ranks of her digital counterparts, BUT as a heroine with excellent erudition, she managed to find a different path to success.Why go to the enemy by storm, if you can get around it? This is the question that directors should ask themselves when they take on the screen adaptation of computer games. Is it difficult: first think about whether the film will be interesting not only for fans of the game, but also for the average viewer? (Most of them even have no idea what Abstergo, Azeroth, Kindred Blades, etc. Are) Once you start explaining all these aspects of the game, SUDDENLY you don't have enough screen time, and vice versa: you miss something important, and SUDDENLY you are cursed by the all-knowing fans.It was for this reason that I was attracted to the Tomb Raider. There is no fantasy world here with its own set of complex rules and tricky interweaving. There is not a whole retinue of heroes who need to be revealed and presented. And most importantly: Alicia Vikander is playing here! Playing almost the only major role throughout the film is not an easy task, but, as it turned out, the actress can do it.The plot will also not make you bored. (When have you ever been bored watching an adventure movie?) Yes, of course, there are moments when you are more concerned about the amount of popcorn left over than the fate of the main characters, but almost any movie can't do without it right now.The action that I wanted to see, I saw, but it would be possible to exceed my expectations.)In a word: the hand does not rise to give this film a bad rating. In addition, when you are in the company of good friends, any trip to the cinema will already be a joy in advance!)",Tomb Raider
1040,x-70891,The soul rushed to heaven.,10,17 June 2021,"'We do not travel to escape from life, but so that life does not escape from us' © Author unknownRestarts and ""reboots"" are now established phenomena in many areas of society. This is the re-screening of long-forgotten stories, the restart of many programs invented by our great-grandfathers, and in general ""Everything new is well-forgotten old"". Restarting games is also no longer a phenomenon. In 2013, Tomb Raider did not become a bright reinterpretation of the genre of such games, but in general breathed new life into a long-forgotten character-Lara Croft (game. Tomb Raider 2013). The character in the game was modernized, became understandable to a new generation of fans of ""robbers of grabnitz"", and although a new character from ""uncharted""was already introduced in the world(who, by the way, will also soon receive his solo film) Lara was able to return the fire to the hearts of her loyal fans, and even attracted a new generation of gamers.As for the new film-the creators held a chic, in my opinion, casting. At first, many-movie bloggers, more or less experts in cinema-doubted whether Alicia Vikander could ""pull"" such a heroine - she seemed so graceful, small, cute, or something, but Alicia during the preparation for the film and during, judging by the materials posted on the network, the implementation of this project did a tremendous job, became strong, modern - it would be rude to say phyto-nyashka on the part of the author - but really her form in the frame looks brilliant.In addition to Alicia, the film featured: Daniel Wu, Dominic West, Walton Goggins, the brilliant Kristin Scott Thomas (who spent little time in the frame), and others.In general, the film was easy to perceive, the plot predictably departed from the canon, a lot of beautiful action scenes, but no more.I advise you to go to those who were not familiar with the films about the robber played by Angelina Jolie, come and start to rediscover the mysterious world invented by the writers of the games and the film. It is worth saying that the film has a certain reserve for the continuation. I hope that the film will get a good distribution, and Alicia will continue to play the role of Lara.",Tomb Raider
1041,x-80538,Reincarnation was successful,10,17 June 2021,"To keep my finger on the pulse of cinema, without having the banal opportunity to go to a session or spend two hours of time on home viewing, I very often watch and read reviews. And if the syndrome of high expectations can play a bad joke on subsequent viewing, then low expectations-helps to soberly assess the picture and often enjoy viewing. I am very happy with the pile of negativity poured on the reincarnation of Lara Croft on the big screens, because my residual opinion at the beginning of the end credits is characterized by the word ""good"".I just didn't find anything that could spoil my impression. Yes, I remember the first dilogy and I am well aware that the film adaptation with Angelina Jolie in the post-Soviet space has received almost a cult status. Yes, the plot is not full of unusual twists, is quite predictable and sometimes too naive...and that's what's so egregiously terrible about the above?The painting does not initially claim to be a cherished statuette. And at the same time, it stands out from a series of fantastically terrible game adaptations. Because it is watchable and does not make you regret the time spent.Let not the best, but the scenario is present here. The acting game does not consist of a tree. Visual effects are available and performed at a very decent level. Well, and where without references to the games, which are here in full abundance. And it is very pleasant that this fan service does not look far-fetched, as it was in the same box-office ""Final"".As a result, we have before our eyes a good entertainment movie that you can watch.

1042,k-39202,A new interpretation of the old story,10,17 June 2021,"I was initially skeptical about the release of a new film about Lara Croft, a character in a popular video game series. Fortunately, my fears were not confirmed, and the new film version of Tomb Raider turned out to be much better than I had expected.We will learn the story of the formation of Lara Croft (Alicia Vikander). At the beginning of the film, Lara appears to us as a young girl who has lost her father (Dominic West), but is not desperate to find him. She puts all her energy into sports, and therefore, is in good physical shape. Suddenly, she has a chance to find out where her father went before he disappeared. Then follow the events that turn the main character into a familiar tomb raider.In general, the original plot of ""Tomb Raider: Lara Croft"" can not boast. It's not bad, but it's banal. For some reason, for action films, they rarely pay due attention to the plot and the script as a whole. It is noteworthy that one of the screenwriters, Evan Doherty, has a nomination for ""Golden Raspberry"" for his work on ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles"", where there was exactly the same problem. You can add that there are several puzzles in the film, but they are not particularly thought out and the viewer is not given a clear understanding of how the characters solve them. Despite this, it is still interesting to watch, since there is a lot of action on the screen, something happens all the time.Junky Ex-El's soundtrack is, as usual, powerful and bouncy. In action scenes, it works perfectly. The cameraman, George Richmond (""Kingsman"" film series), also did not disappoint, and gave us a large number of beautiful shots.Academy Award winner Alicia Vikander perfectly got used to the role of an adventurer. It's good that this role went to a really talented and charismatic actress. I used to see Walton Goggins in more emotional and comedic roles, but here he has a completely different role. Goggins plays a sullen, life-worn villain.The script was weak, but the film managed to tell a whole story. The technical side is excellent and there are no complaints about it. As well as to the performer of the main role, Alicia Vikander, who, in my opinion, became the main advantage of the film. The Norwegian director Roar Uthaug, who made his debut in American cinema, managed to make a good action-adventure film.",Tomb Raider

-Movie was short for me, they could have added many more things such as more screen time in Tomb.
-Trinity obsession, really guys? Instead of having Lara Croft just exploring what she wants to find, you always have her fighting those trinity guys?Also I think this movie is better than Angelina's Jolie Tomb Raider.

Characters made connections to things that made no sense to the audience, and had relationships with other characters that never even developed during any of the film. Some visual effects were good, but others lacking greatly, and were over the top.

There were moments that seemed flat, and some support characters weren't as developed as they could have been, maybe it WAS a bit hammy in places... but I've played TR from the first game and I thought this origins story was well put together and the Lara development seemed genuine. It was a bit of a leap from her first gritty survival kill (for which I liked she showed remorse albeit for a brief second) to the second instant bow & arrow instant kill and they didn't do enough archery back story to pay off the Rambo style kill spree, I thought the premise of the disease twist was good, it doesn't take you to a supernatural path like the previous films but the potential global impact is enough jeopardy to warrant the heroic effort.

And sure did, it turned out perfect. A well physically-fit Alicia Vikander who seems to represent a real figure of an Army female soldier and not in tights with no big flaunty big boobs - and there we have it, we got ourselves a downright good character. Then count-in the plot of an adventurer/archaeologist who wants to seek the truth about her father in an uncharted island - it's not impossible. And wow - the actions in this movie reminisce my adrenaline experience when I was chased by a wild hog in a dark wilderness. That's how good it was, and verisimilitude is 10/10 stars!Come on there's no such people who have superpowers to fly, disappear in front of your face, climb the wall etc. With the exemption of Batman who is a police-like character, other superpower heroes are non-sense as of this date for me. And I may just given up on those crowd effects of bashing-up thousand of characters to one another and typical silhouette postures of a comic hero. I stopped praising much these tight fitted characters after Iron-man 3 starring Robert Downey Jr. Sorry, but after seeing Black Panther's commercial, I'm just seeing same old thing, and it just didn't give me same vibe as before.

So much time was wasted with needless running, extended fight scenes, and Lara trying to climb on/out/up/over something.
If this was meant to be a prequel, why does the time line take place now? Maybe so that email and satellite phones can make sense to help the plot? 
Also, why kill off a character that we clearly see alive and well in the 2nd Lara Croft movie? 
It doesn't matter how bad or good the first 2 movies were, why couldn't they have stayed canon?

First i would say out loud that Alicia Vikander is probably the best action hero i have seen for a very long time and im a huge Marvel and DC fan. 
The way she acts out all of those emotions that displays the amount of blood sweat and tears yet she still finds the humongous amount of courage to carry out what needs to be done. I felt what she felt all the way through the film. Fantastic action acting. We need more like Alicia. Movie was also beautiful and the puzzles i just loved them. From seeing the old Angelina Jolie versions it is great to see an origin story that unfolds like this.

1058,aresando,"Relatively decent movie, despite its doomed fate",7,3 June 2018,"Videogame adaptations are always a tricky exercise and Tomb Raider takes a double toll considering how Lara's character has drastically evolved in the most recent iterations of the game. Old fans will not recognise here the character (and body shape, hum hum) of the Lara they played in the 2000's. Young fans will of course be disappointed that the script of the movie didn't follow minute by minute the - quite cinematic - scenario of the game from which it derives.Technically, the movie is enjoyable. Cinematography is reasonably good for an action-adventure flick. The soundtrack is unfortunately pretty absent, and the script is totally uninspired. Too bad for a movie that derives from a version of the video game that was a reboot and (much better) origin story.As a long time player who also played the modern games, I was reasonably satisfied however, mostly by the acting. The British cast is funny and to the point. Wu makes a good hongker. Vikander is both charming and tough enough.

Alicia Vikander gives Lara depth and personality much like Harrison Ford's Indiana Jones. She's vulnerable, hurt by her fathers mysterious disappearance 7 years ago and maybe to some extent her mothers death much earlier. But she's also stubborn and focused to survive on her own and has never lost hope that she'll once again see her father and bring him back home to rule the empire of companies he left behind. The story is built on the reboot of the video game series but takes another way after the arrival at the destination where most of the action takes place. When the story follows the video game it has weaknesses (as so many games to movie do), but when it stands on its own it shows glimpses of coming adventures for Lara Croft that makes you want more, much because of Vikanders performance.A very good cinematic experience!",Tomb Raider

1076,mathias-pressthat,"Lara turned into a twitchy teenager, and it's cringy to watch",4,29 April 2018,"Tomb Raider's lara croft is supposed to be a woman who does not back down, is ingenious and will stand out because of her tough attitude. Unfortunately, the movie's creators were preoccupied with channeling their feminist message so hard that it became troublesome.Lara's journey begins, as we know, with her father's dissappearance. While Lara has Always had trouble with her father's absence, it has never lead to childish behaviour or erratic decision making. The way the character was written in this version of Tomb Raider is poorly done, with often annoying dialogs written into the movie to convey the message of Lara being a strong woman (stronger than men). The problem with this is not the message, in fact, the previous Tomb Raider was well able to convey this message without ostentaciously placing it in the dialog the entire time. The problem lies with the fact that this message becomes so apparant and so omnipresent that Lara seems to be a character that has yet to exit puberty, trying to overly prove herself. This in turn makes her look weak, instead of strong. This makes her look not like the tomb raider we know, but rather a character that seems completely out of place. Furthermore, we rarely see Lara showing her actual strength and skills, which really left us waiting for more and in the end left us dissapointed.Story wise, there are some very weird choices where the story was obviously being prolonged just for the sake of making the movie longer. Lara had several opportunities to finish the job early but instead did not. Instead of choosing to put this into the final cut, it would've been a better choice to change the arcs so that the decision making seems much more logical.The cast was not to blame for this blatant cash-in of a movie. Ms vikander did all she could with what she was given, I think. She obviously can do more and throughout the movie we do see some glimpses of an actual strong character. I really feel as if she suffered from bad screenwriting and dialogs.All in all, this was an entertaining movie but it doesn't earn the title of Tomb Raider and definitely doesn't deserve a higher score than the Original (which in itself, was not a good movie either but at least faithful to the games).",Tomb Raider

During the movie I started to play a game from which movie the next scene is taken from. It was quite amusing for some time and kept me not walking away.Anyhow some points that made that movie waste of money for me:
They put no effort whatsoever in the puzzles and underestimated their viewers by explaining how they did it. Lara opened the cave wall which was done from metal, but explosives couldn't destroy it? 
Acting was mediocre, couldn't care less if any of the characters would die.
I didn't get her father's character at all: Lara arrives to the island and he lives like Robinson Crusoe in some kind of cave, gone totally mad, doesn't recognise her and in next moment they plot a plan against the antagonist. Second moment when Lara was walking on unstable log of wood and almost fall down to deathly bones her father didn't even blink his eyes?? No emotion 
No one of them had interesting background stories or personality lines. 
Antagonist wasn't scary enough or twisted enough. Gave me same vibe like in ""Vice Principals"".
Script- I guess that even 1 year movie student could have done a better work, there was no memorable lines, everything was already heard million times.

1088,jo-sycamore,People need to do their research....,8,9 August 2018,"I thought it was a decent film. I dont know what peoples expectations were!! The story is based on the latest, newer versions of the game franchise where Lara is younger and doesnt have all of her abilities or experience yet. Shes not even interested in any of it. It is the beginning of Lara Croft and needs a background story like any origin story. The new franchise focuses on her inabilities and the fact that shes not perfect and has to learn to survive. Which she does in this film. 
The original game starts as an older Lara Croft as does the Angelina Jolie films. She is well into her 'Tomb Raiding' skills and has picked up many friends and enemies along the way. 
I dont understand why people are moaning that its 'not like the original'. 'She doesnt have all her abilities yet' 'Shes skinny and less charismatic' Again this is an Origins Story read between the lines people n dont give it a bad review because you cant understand that! 
As an avid fan of the gaming franchise i both like the older slightly unrealistic deeply puzzling games and the new, grittier younger versions. Give it a chance and hopefully a sequel will have more puzzles n tomb raiding. I do know there is only so much you can put into 2hrs though, shame",Tomb Raider

It's a fun 2 hours and Vikander did great. It's not Angelina era Lara Croft, big deal. It's better. This is of course based on the recently rebooted video game and while it changes the story from the game it's still a good movie. Leagues better than any other video game-based movie out there.

Alicia played the role SO well... the game mechanics are subtly inserted into the movie, like bow handling and jumping, puzzle solving... but so discretely that it was just gorgeous to watch. All in all a nice sit through with a simple but compelling story and enough juice for the game-fan to enjoy it as well!
I especially like that Lara is portrayed like a normal human, not as a super-hero. With all her basic human sides, flaws and virtues. And although Alicia is beautiful, the film does not overdo the sex appeal like it did with Angelina. The film is a joy to watch <3",Tomb Raider

I am a angelina fan.First Vakander has definitely worked out for the characters sake. From the start how Lara's desperate moment lead to the bicycle race scene gave me a hype. her face shows all the emotion I wanted to see, the determination, frustration, anger and sadness from scene by scene. That was so emotional like I am living in it. If I mentioned how badly I didn't want her to suffer a little bit more, I would be lying.When she escape from vogel, that kept me foot tapping. With the fight with rocker, It's like she's officially entering into the character. From Lara; a failure to Croft; a brave and strong woman. That was definitely character build.It's true Vikander's character no charismatic like angelina's but I wasn't looking for angelina in Vikander like few others do. So I see only Vikander, ah like a pro character, more of advanced and strong in physically and emotionally.I will leave Himiko's powers unknown because I don't want to spoil the fun but that was a clever secret.I was waiting for a movie as thrilling as this and highly appreciate this.

1106,thelasttimeisawdave,This Is The Best Video Game Movie So Far,9,22 March 2018,"Greatly enjoyed.Hollywood has been working for years to try and turn successful video games into successful movies. While they have been met with limited success, these studios have yet to really make a movie that has won over audiences on a broad scale. The most recent effort, Tomb Raider, was not the first great video game movie that so many of us have been waiting for, but it was the closest that we have come so far, and it was clearly a step in the right direction. It certainly qualifies as the best movie based on a game so far.
Tomb Raider wasn't perfect, but it was good. That by itself puts the movie above nearly all its competition. There are several things that Tomb Raider did right in making the transition from the video game to the theatrical release. Here are a few of them.
If there's one thing that most of the reviews have agreed on, even those that didn't love the film, it's that whatever faults Tomb Raider has, Alicia Vikander is not one of them. The actress puts forth a strong performance as the new Lara Croft and is able to make her a believable action hero while also making her a relatable character",Tomb Raider
1107,greatlynch,There is a reason people called the latest TR is Reboot,9,19 March 2018,"Tomb Raider, the 2013 video game, was lauded for revitalizing one of gaming's biggest names and most venerable franchises, and it did it in part by leaning into the narrative side of the medium, with greater depth and characterization for its lead and a clear and compelling story it wanted to tell with her. It surprisingly plays like a throwback to the classic late-'80s/early '90s era of action filmmaking, represented by the likes of ""Cliffhanger,"" ""The Last of the Mohicans.
Alicia Vikander did a great job here. She's correctly cast as a woman who's literally to-the-manor-born. More importantly, though, she's an action hero par excellence. Carved like a wood sculpture, and seemingly bereft of body fat, Vikander hurls herself into the film's action sequences. She makes you feel the physicality of this intensely visceral performance, letting out a high-pitched grunt of rage or pain when Lara crashes into a wall or gets slammed on the ground by a brawny foe, and letting sparks of fury flash in her eyes as Lara delivers a coup-de-grace.",Tomb Raider

1115,ben-n302,DONT LISTEN TO BAD REVIEWS. SOLID MOVIE,9,17 March 2018,"This is a good movie. I went into the film with low expectations because of all the negative reviews. They could not be more wrong!!! This is a great movie. The good points, 
Fantastic visuals. There are some visuals in this movie that are very jaw dropping and have you at the edge of your seat. It actually makes you feel like you are there! In the movie! Solid story line. The story is simple BUT the movie is gripping. Every story normally keeps the audience interested in movies by making the story line extremely complicated. Not here. This is simple and to the point, and that's great! It alows you to share the feelings that the characters have. There is love. Action that is extremely realistic in most parts of the movie. 
And a nice twist at the end. There are many many more good points of this movie. But I shall allow you to experience them for yourself. EXEPTIONAL ACTING. Really well picked actors that assume their roles with dignity!!! And you have to see it to understand. But the leads really do get stuck into their characters.... and it showed. BUT A SLIGHT BAD POINT it is Almost over done in my opinion. 
for example the lead hurt herself and found it hard to walk clutching her side in pure agony. Then a few hours later she is running at full pace without second thought.....a bit too extreme as it lead you on to thinking she was way past done for one minute and then the next she is running at full pace and never touches her injury again. So in my opinion it was too much acting that made it a little unrealistic. but I will have to watch again with a different mindset before I am set in stone. Now the real bad points. There are occasional moments that you question the realism of the action sequences (such as gunfire missing its target conveniently). Now don't get me wrong. It's still cool but I think this movie would profit more with a hint more realism. The main twist was a little predictable. You can see the twist coming, but it was probably designed that way to add to the cliff hanger that finnished the movie that makes me strongly suspect that there will be a sequel!! In conclusion I have to say that the movie is fantastic and I shall be buying it on 4K when it comes out. It's a good, bright, visually stunning movie that will take you on a rollicoster of a ride that manages to keep you on the edge of your seat. With a relationship between father and daughter that is touching and true. Over all I would say the negatives are extremely drowned out by the positives that's easily make it for me a solid 9.",Tomb Raider
1116,sarangraviton,Disappointing,6,6 February 2019,It tries to plot like game but it's finally very diferrent from game. Disappointing.,Tomb Raider
1117,robin-fagerstrom,Tomb Raider has never been this bad,3,1 June 2018,"Seriously, this is by far the worst Tomb Raider move ever made. Why? Because the actor playing Lara Croft is an extremely poor fit. She looks nothing like the Tomb Raider from the games (old or new). Angelina Jolie was a better fit on all levels. The story of the movie follows that of the Tomb Raider reboot from 2013. Problem is they've changed and messed up so much of it that sometimes you can't even tell that they're one and the same. Seriously, if you're a Tomb Raider fan, just do yourself a favor and stay away from this one. If you don't know what Tomb Raider is and just want 2 hours of mediocre entertainment, then by all means give it a try.",Tomb Raider

1120,salvas-ra,Solid,7,27 March 2019,"It´s not a masterpiece, but it´s a solid movie.
Vikander is much more natural than Jolie. I enjoyed it.
Some moves reminded me of the games, and I think that is positive!",Tomb Raider
1121,urieltorres619,Not was I was hoping for,10,19 March 2018,"The movie was a complete mess, although some parts were awesome but they change the whole story. I was so exited for the movie, I played the game like twenty times and hoping the movie will be as good a the game but it wasn't. The game is so full of action and the story was perfect, the movie didn't captured the essence of the game plus the plot of the movie was awful very bad plot. But I find the a little bit enjoyable so go and watch it and get your own conclusions.",Tomb Raider
1122,qx899,Great movie: the haters will eventually be proven wrong,10,2 June 2018,"Really good! I'm not sure why all the hateful reviews. I put it equal to Black Panther. (Just my opinion.)This movie is largely based on 2013 Tomb Raider reboot (game). Alicia Vikander is the perfect Lara Croft in this context. I prefer Vikander to Angelina Jolie's version. It's not even close. Vikander's character is more believable and more relatable. Maybe that's one reason some are hating on this movie, but really, this is the reason I love it. I would say this version is more grounded but just as exciting. There is no shortage of action or excitement. However, characters also have depth. Most video game movies lack character development, but this movie pulls it off amazingly well. I am absolutely sure this movie will gain a huge fan base, and the haters will eventually be proven wrong.",Tomb Raider
1123,kvam_89,Just perfectly splendid!,10,25 August 2021,"Its a good origin story, it gives an ""uncharted"" vibe.",Tomb Raider
1124,fezarecool,Taking yourself seriously really does make a difference.,7,15 March 2018,"I'm going to get this out of the way and say this is the best movie based on a video game so far, best way to describe it is that this is the X-Men for the video game movie genre.The movie treats itself not as a cash grab or a novelty but as a series adaption as if it was based on a comic or book (as it should be) and it truely shows. The characters are human instead of cut-outs or fan service easter eggs like all the Resident Evil films, they have a true sense of reality to them and you grow to understand them. Alicia Vikander's ""Lara Croft"" and Walten Goggins ""Mathias Vogel"" are the standouts here.Lara grows through the film in a reasonable way that never feels forced or contrived and we understand her way of thinking and grow attached to her, every moment of fear, pain or joy we feel too. Mathias is the villain that this movie needed to keep itself apart from the rest of the video game crowd. Mathias isn't look for world domination or blind power, he's a desperate man looking to see his children again and he goes to some horrifying lengths to see them again much as Lara pushes to find her Father.An interesting part of the film is Lu Ren, the male lead of the film. But he's not what you think, there's no budding romance or flirting (The most flirting in the film comes from Nick Frost's cameo). Lara and Ren feel like comrades than lovers and never try to be, I doubt we will see him in a sequel since his story seems to end here and that's just fine.The story flows well and never feels rushed or uninteresting, the movie manages to keep the audiences attention and investment though out. It's important to note that the main structure is heavily inspired by the formula ""Indiana Jones"" follows, especially during the climax as there's a few shout outs to The Last Crusade.If you're looking for references and easter eggs there plenty on offer, in particular during the climax as there's quite a few nods to the PS1 games here.In my final thoughts I'd say Tomb Raider is a great time and a return to form for franchise especially after the disappointment of ""Cradle of Life"" Hopefully we'll get a fun sequel and maybe even a return to the adventure genre that we haven't seen since ""National Treasure"".",Tomb Raider
1125,jamie-832-924456,Lara triumphant,9,17 March 2018,Loved this film. As a big fan of the gaming reboot this pressed all the right buttons with set-pieces that genuinely surprised and a more natural and real Lara than we've seen before. The peril felt real and the plot was pretty darned good. Can't wait for a sequel. Definitely breaks the video game curse and hopefully opens the doors to a few that have been stuck in development he'll like Nathan Drake and The Last of Us.,Tomb Raider
1126,stump1000,Great Movie,9,30 December 2018,"I personally enjoyed this movie. I was actually trying to go to sleep but this movie wouldn't let me. I've never seen any of the other Tomb Raider movies, but I'd be surprised if they are as good as this one.",Tomb Raider
1127,fgoncebate-881-122609,Why people can't realize that is an adaptation,9,3 June 2018,"If a this movie was 100% loyal to the video game, it should take like 5 movies.

That's it.",Tomb Raider
1128,clarksonw,Very very good,9,18 March 2018,"When did we become so precious and opinionated? Why can't we go to the cinema to just escape for a couple of hours without having to dissect the movie to within an inch of its being? Character development, relationships??? I like watching movies and a lot of them and it's got to be pretty damn bad for me to not watch it. That said I found this really, really enjoyable. Vikander was excellent, the game style action sequences were spot on. I wanted to watch it again straight away. Just go see it.",Tomb Raider
1129,joewasone,No thing in this movie is good.,1,31 May 2020,"Everyone connected with this movie should never work again. The writers first and foremost then the producers and the director. Only, the cinamatographer and sound people are worth anything. The main actors should never work again. A good director could have overcome the bad writing and helped the actors save face but no. Avoid this film like a plage.",Tomb Raider
1130,hannategner,Very disappointed,3,14 February 2019,"It's funny how they managed to find someone who was amazing for the role of Lara Croft, Alicia Vikander could totally pull off the character. But they totally flopped with the story and its just frustrating when the game had an amazing story. There are so many things they did wrong with the plot. The villian? So damn boring compared to the crazy psycho we saw in the game! Reviving her dad and saying he's been alive on the island this whole time? Like why? It's just not interesting! And this whole movie is about seeing her BECOME the Tomb Raider and badass we all know, it's about her surviving in the wilderness amongst A LOT of enemies trying to kill her. There is just no depth in this film like I saw in the game! After being so excited to see this for so long i didn't even finish watching it. It was just a huge dissapointment. If you haven't played the game perhaps this movie could be somewhat good but im telling you, you're missing out.",Tomb Raider
1131,danicameron12,This was a slap in the face for true fans of the game.,3,20 August 2018,"As a hardcore fan of the game series (I own and have played all games, dlc, various collectables, etc.) I was so excited for this reboot. The rebooted games were insanely good. So good in fact, that I have played through the games in excess of 5 or 6 times. But this movie? I regret watching it. Let me first say this: Alicia Vikander was a SOLID choice for the role. She could have been so much more if the writers hadn't completely destroyed the story. While I realize that you can't fit everything into a movie adaptation, I expect that at least the story won't be completely butchered. If you are a fan of the tomb raider series, don't waste your time on this. You will walk away angry.",Tomb Raider
1132,Louise-lawlor,"Not enough ""tomb-raidering""",2,17 March 2018,"Too much time spend on a meaningless back story that doesn't add to the real story line of the film. Script was dreadful and predictable. Don't get me wrong wasn't expecting Shakespeare. In a film like this you want to see the baddie early so you get time to hate him, unfortunately the film makers did not understand this rather, they spent the whole time showing us heroine of the film and her personal battle of her own making.",Tomb Raider

Name a video game movie that is actually good... there is none i remember...People complaining that she should be an expert in everything... right, this aspect is in the video game, but it's actually silly in my opinion to put that in a movie... it feels less realistic, i hope there will be a sequel.",Tomb Raider

The action scenes were just like the new rebooted video game franchise and the fight scenes are incredible.

Story was going too fast, acting was 50/50, visual effects was poor and music not so great. I don't like it, but I've seen worse :D If you like the games (especially the new ones) I don't recommend it. Enjoy.",Tomb Raider
1138,Tygerian,"Faithful Interpretation of Source Material, Flawed Execution",8,18 March 2018,"Let me preface this by saying that I have finished the 2013's Tomb Raider (the game this movie is loosely based on) multiple times and have thoroughly enjoyed it. If you have not played that game (or did not enjoy its story) this review might not be helpful to you.Contains light SPOILERS where indicated.What I likedAlicia Vikander is great as Lara. Wit, will, fearlessness - those same qualities I've come to admire in the digital Lara - she brings to the big screen.The action scenes are the definite strong suite of of this film. Tensions run high, and resolution is often satisfying. The bike chase scene especially I found unique and very well executed.Talking of which, I'm glad they decided to take some time to show Lara's life before the trip to Yamatai (note: the game starts with her arrival at the island). Something that would have been very expensive to do in the game, makes perfect sense here and helps flesh out Lara's character (as well as setting up several scenes later on).SPOILER (for the movie AND the 2013 game): Finally, I'm very glad they decided to do away with the supernatural ending. That was one thing I did not like about the game, and it makes the entire plot feel more grounded.What I didn't likeLack of coherent style: I liked the music during the movie, and the music during credits, but I have no idea what they're supposed to have in common. I enjoyed the intro sequence with the pages and ancient pictures, and the stylized credits, but again, they very different stylistically. Same for the red/white logo, followed by yellow credit text. Which is disappointing since the game has a very defined aural and visual style. I must assume that either they didn't get or refused help from folks who worked on the game.Heavy handed use of flashbacks: I have nothing against flashbacks in general (the way they are implemented in the game is brilliant by the way), but I feel like the the direction reached for that particular tool way too often here. Give your audience some credit - you don't need to spell everything out. Also you don't need to repeat things we just saw 15 minutes ago just in case we forgot. Use that screen time for something interesting!Speaking of which, here are some ideas for what I missed: there are several characters introduced in the first few scenes that we never see again. We get to revisit the pawnshop couple, but not what seems like her close friend?SPOILER: The ending was a heavy handed ""hint"" at a sequel. Which is not necessarily bad, but I much preferred the open ended way the game ended. On a related note, I feel Ana ended up a fairly transparent character (maybe intentionally?)Overall, I did enjoy the movie, and I'm hoping they use this as starting point to craft a more refined sequel. The second game in the series (Rise of the Tomb Raider) has a more complex story that I think could work in a movie (with the right screenwriter and a more experienced director).",Tomb Raider
1139,glennlimos,They missed the point,5,12 September 2018,"I love the new reboot of games, the story and characters are good and engaging. This movie does take artistic freedoms that I could live with, but the worst part is that they take away the supernatural aspect of the TR universe. When they do this it makes Laras dad seem like a conspiracy loon that is barely half correct in his assumption regarding the Himiko legend, and it reduces Trinity to a black marked dealer of biological weapons, not an organization that want world domination through supernatural means.",Tomb Raider
1140,danimajic,Does it make sense?No.Does it take itself too seriously?Yes.,5,23 March 2018,"If you enjoy brainless,illogical movies then sit back and have fun. But if you want to see a movie with good characters and meaningful story then stay away from this one. The first 15 minutes of the movie had me filled with hope, but it was soon lost. At the beginning of the movie Lara doesn't seem to strong. The movie tricks you into thinking that she will have to work and train harder to become this super woman, but she miraculously doesn't. There are few scenes where she has to survive some impossible situations that are pretty fun, but they don't carry any emotional weight or give any bigger purpose to the story or characters. Also shooting scenes are very bland and bud guys aim like they hold a weapon for the first time. There are some plot twists that didn't really made much sense. The main antagonist of the story is one dimensional what wouldn't be that much of problem if the protagonist was any better. To sum it up it could be worse but it could be much better. If you want some brainless action then you shuld watch the movie.",Tomb Raider

Having come back from the cinema, I can say that this is a solid film; possibly the best adaption of a video game, at least off the top of my head. Alicia nails it as Lara Croft, although in this film we see her origins, and so isn't necessarily the Lara we know and love! But she is getting there, and Alicia pulls it off well. The CGI was a bit spotty in places, but nothing terrible by any means, and yes there are a few cliches and overused story devices here and there, but overall it is an enjoyable film which I will certainly buy on Blu Ray, and I hope it does well enough to get a sequel. Go see it!",Tomb Raider

I love that they took Lara Croft and made her real. The treasure or mystic artifact turned out to be something Logical and real. The legends around it we're believable, the trials she faced to reach the end were believable, and the end result was believable. No many people that were friends of the video games were upset about the fact that it wasn't exactly like the video game, but as stated, the storyline was believable. Alicia Vikander did amazing job. And the best part was that they did not write her in a love interest. She was a bad ass all on her own without swooning over someone.",Tomb Raider

1160,melissamedinavo,"Bad Writing, GREAT stunts, Alicia Vikander rocks!",5,24 March 2018,"This was the most inconsistently I've ever enjoyed a movie. I think I finally get what every guy feels when they watch a Star Wars or Marvel movie - you're so happy to see the characters you love doing the things they're famous for that you almost forgive its entire lack of a coherent plot. I don't think I'd recommend this movie unless you're a hardcore fan of the franchise. But for me, I have played all the games on PC and systems and I was so happy to finally get a female video game heroine when I was young. As a fan, I was perplexed by how they tried to fit in old tomb raider and the new survivalist tomb raider. I was annoyed that they included the campiness of the old games with the aesthetic of the new. All of the physical aspects of this tomb raider were STELLAR though, and they took painstaking care to make all of the stunts physically possible, but they forgot to make the plot possible. I still fangirled hard in places, and overall I thought it was a good attempt. I want to see Alicia Vikander in more movies, because, despite the awful writing, she kicked ass - way more than Wonder Woman. For what it's worth, I haven't believed in a woman's physicality this much since Terminator 2. The action, stunts, and Alicia Vikander were great, but the writing was ridiculous. I personally would re-edit the film with ONLY Alicia Vikander scenes.",Tomb Raider
1161,zoller77,Brought back my childhood,8,6 February 2019,"I haven't watched such an entertaining action movie since a long time. I have to admit, that I can't be objective on this one, because the Tomb Raider franchise is an important part of my childhood.Nowadays, when we have less and less original ideas in movies, we get a lot of adaptations. About 75 % of this adaptations fail, for example: TMNT(which raped my childhood and was a disgrace), Warcraft(which was so so) etc.But there are good sides of it too because last year the Power Rangers movie where the beggining of this nostalgia rollercoaster for me, and now this movie is the peak of it. Both of them weren't perfect, but the main aim of these movies have to be to give back the mood. The mood of my childhood. And this movie where the perfect example of it. After an awful TMNT adaptation, looks like we're getting decent ones, and this is one of my favourite movies.No wonder, why it gets low numbers, maybe it's not feminist/PC enough, I guess",Tomb Raider
1162,mattcucanic,A great action thriller!!,10,17 March 2018,"Tomb Raider was the most fun I've had in an action movie in a long time. The film is a loose amalgamation of the two most recent video games, with many of the big action sequences ripped straight from the 2013 reboot. The action was thrilling and tense, with Alicia Vikander really selling both the character of Lara Croft and the danger of the situations she finds herself in. Her performance is incredible in the movie's quieter, emotional moments as well.There are a couple of scenes that play out a little awkwardly (notably the introduction of Walton Goggins's character), but they don't detract from the film overall.Overall, I highly recommend this film. But just go and have fun with it. It's not a film for overthinking, for sure.",Tomb Raider

Frankly enough, I was bored the whole time, mainly because of the storyline (not gonna blame it on the acting in fact). The story was slow-moving and there was literally no climax or something like that throughout.

Get over it Angelina isn't even pretty and those movies sucked. Vikander STEALS this role and she's flat out gorgeous and made this her own. If you wanna see boobs go watch porn. If you wanna see a bad ass woman stand up for herself and not have a dude help her out the whole time and fucking kill shit without a love interest (which was awesome btw) see this movie. It's actually the only good video game movie.",Tomb Raider
1168,vittoriorinaldi,Not as expected,5,4 September 2018,"Well, the movie is not that bad but it lacks in several matters. First of all the storyline is silly, nothing extraordinary that lets you say ""wow, that was great"". Actress? Nothing to do with Angelina Jolie. One more thing, the movie is a little sexist.",Tomb Raider
1169,azriel_miller,What a suprise.,8,24 May 2021,"I watched this movie because I had just completed the third installment of the recent video game series (Shadow of the Tomb Raider) & wow was this a pleasant suprise. The setup was cool. An mma spar followed by a quick bike chase scene, & straight into the puzzling family drama. Alicia Vikander was perfectly cast in my opinion as well. Her action sequences were executed better than alot of fight scenes in recent movies *cough* Mortal Kombat *cough*, & she carried herself as a dominant action star throughout the 2hour long film.I would have liked to see her reconnect with all the characters that were shown during the intro, her courier co-workers, fellow gym members & the little indian family at the restaurant, but hey, I'm just happy this even exists! I really hope they do a sequel since the games are finished, & as fans I guess this is all we have for now.",Tomb Raider

This new movie didn't do it for me at all. The lead seems hugely miscast and the plot/action seems more appropriate for a TV movie. Maybe gamers will appreciate it more but for general audiences I would suggest giving this one a pass.",Tomb Raider

The traps of the tomb was ridiculous simple,short and It did not build tension. Not worth the money.",Tomb Raider

And a hint to the directors : With age things change! What had a ''wow' effect in the '01th, definitely doesn't now. People had become more realistic, and we pay more attention to details. So try a little bit harder.

1177,vicaprotovin,A great adaptation of the 2013 Tomb Raider game,8,16 March 2018,"This movie is a great adaptation of the 2013 Tomb Raider game. I think that the makers of this film selected the best action elements from the game such as Lara's deadly jump on the abandoned airplane and her way of opening the parachute. It was a super positive surprise that basically all scenes in the movie were dynamic and full of action. I did not find time to eat my popcorn at all in the cinema because the movie kept me just watching it. Also, Alicia Vikander and the rest of the cast were super cool. I missed though all the staff of the Endurance from the game. However, I think that it would not have been easy to integrate so many individual stories of the Endurance staff into a 2 hours long movie. I am going to definitely watch the movie again this month :)",Tomb Raider

1180,ahariharan,Script is totally bad,4,2 June 2018,"I saw the movie and here is what I wanna say. The director of this movie just ruined the version of Lara Croft. Did you seriously think that Lara was a coward. That's just RIDICULOUS. Lara is a very brave and a trained warrior. Now I will go to the script.This was the WORST Script that I have ever seen. At the first half, Lara was afraid of fighting normal thieves with knives and in the second half of the movie,Lara amazingly kills Trained Mercs with a bow and arrow. How in the world is this possible??? The only good scenes in the movie were 'the scene where Lara Manages to escape from the hands of Trinity and the part where Lara found out who the real culprit was. The rest of the scenes in the movie are just bad.",Tomb Raider
1181,booseeboo,Just okay,5,10 March 2018,"I had no idea that this was supposed to be a prequel to the Lara Croft films that starred Angelina Jolie, so the first emotion I felt while watching this film was disappointment at how weak and stupid Alicia Vikander's Lara Croft was in the action sequences at the beginning of the film (at the gym and on the streets). She would soon (too soon?) become strong enough to choke a grizzly muscular tracker to death, but she would remain stupid until the end, wasting too many obvious opportunities to kill Walton Goggins' lame Matthias Vogel on their way to Himiko's coffin.There are only two things I liked about this film. First was the ""transformation,"" in the mind of the viewer unfamiliar with Tomb Raider lore, of Himiko, from an undead evil sorceress to a heroic queen and carrier of a deadly organism. After reading up on Tomb Raider lore, I would learn that this was a complete departure from the lore, where Himiko, who had the power of soul transfer, would try to use this power for selfish ends until she meets her own end.The second thing I like about the film, which is what possibly ""saves"" the film, for male viewers at least, is Vikander's (or her stunt double's?) sexy running and grunting. I wonder if this was intentional.",Tomb Raider
1182,zachsmith-07622,Entertaining Action Movie!,8,17 March 2018,"I don't typically write reviews but feel a little compelled based on some of the negative criticisms in other reviews. I went into this movie without expectations. I just wanted a good fun action movie and was curious if Alicia V could be a good Lara Croft action hero. And I gotta say I enjoyed Tomb Raider. It wasn't perfect, but hardly any action movie like this can be. But it was entertaining. The stunts and visuals were awesome. The suspense was great. Alicia V was great. A few parts of the story were a bit cheesy, but other than that it was awesome! Hope they make a sequel.",Tomb Raider

1185,leesarkarsangeet,Quite simply the worst film I have ever seen.,1,20 July 2018,"From it's slow, dragging first half, through to the end of the film, this was an abysmal attempt at storytelling. I would expect a Tomb Raider movie to be packed with adventure and action thrills. This had very few, if you could stick it through to the second half of the movie. The first half concentrating on a 'back story' that is virtually irrelevant. The poor storyline is only matched by the awful acting and visual effects. If you watch this hoping it will redeem itself by the end, you're wasting your time.Eugh :(",Tomb Raider

""Laura Croft"" is strong, intelligent and resourceful, and this portrayal was just disappointing the movie started with Alicia Vikander getting her ass kicked and continued to get her ass handed to her throughout the entire movie.

1190,efidem,Good movie for newcomers; Terrible adaptation of the game,7,9 July 2018,"The movie was good... if we only see is as a movie and not an adaptation.If you haven't played any of the games and you're just interested in this movie then you're probably going to like it.But the majority of people waiting for this movie were people who played the 2013 game with the same title. The game was a really good one and we were really excited to see some of those scenes that we played through in the game. We had high expectations that the movie tore down.The movie was a terrible adaptation of the game as it only kept the general concept of the ancient kingdom of Yamatai and the Sun Queen, Himiko and threw away almost everything else from the original material.Flaw #1: The crewIn the game, Lara isn't sailing alone to Yamatai. She was a whole lot of crew-mates with her, such as Sam, Alex and of course Roth! Each of them had an interesting personality and a role to play. And each of them had a different but important relationship with Lara. For example Roth was such a great father figure to Lara and he was always an amazing character, always encouraging Lara and believing in her as well as protecting her. So I was much more than disappointed to see all those characters thrown away.Flaw #2: The IslandWhile the movie pulled the general image of the island off, it doesn't even compare to the island from the game. The island is one of the things that make the game so good, as Lara gets to explore so many different places, like the palace, the beach, the mountains and the shantytown. There were so many different locations and through the movie, we only got to see the forest and the tomb. Disappointing!Flaw #3: Richard is alive?!Yeah that was just a big mistake. It was completely unnecessary, and for the fans of the game this was just stupid and it was probably because the script writers were running out of ideas.Flaw #4: The Oni and the Sun QueenSo the movie went completely off the rails when it comes to these. Starting with the Sun Queen, Himiko, she went from one hell of a scary powerful woman to a sick girl? I don't think they had to turn magic to science for the sake of the movie. It would still have been acceptable. Moving on to the Oni. Since they excluded magic, they couldn't include the Oni as the queens magnificent Storm Guard and instead replaced them with dead handmaidens. Nice! Flaw #5: SamSam is the driving force of the events that occurr in the game. She is introduced as a friend of Lara's and it is later revealed that Himiko is her ancestor. She gets abducted by Mathias and she is to be used as the Sun Queen's new vessel. Everything revolving around the Sun Queen is because of Sam. And like every other crew member she was just tossed away.Flaw #6: The timelineLara remained on the island for two days. Two Days! In the game it's weeks! Two days hardly make her a survivor.The only change I liked was the the addition of Lu Ren's character",Tomb Raider

I honestly thought I'd be annoyed about the fact that Angelina Jolie was not Lara, but I absolutely loved this movie. I love movies but usually look away to check my texts and what not. But this movie had me in the zone! I felt like I was in the game! The people that are giving this movie negative reviews are clearly not die hard fans of the series.

Felt I like they took every cliche from every bad movie and said let's do that. Made Angelina's versions look like Oscar calibur. Was actually rooting for Lara to die, she was that bad. Alicia was wooden, with no charm, charisma, nothing. Such a bad choice. Whole plot was simply stupid. You could see from a mile away what was going to happen. Also, basic physics does not exist in this world apparently. I do not mind over the top, but it was so ridiculous. AJ needs to come back for a sequel and show them how it is done.",Tomb Raider

If they follow the story line closely and take all good scenes from the game this movie simple can not fail. Boy did it fail! Lara did not look like a Lara, her dad looked like he was unsure of his lines. And the rest where B movie porn actors that finally got a role where they did not have to slap a huge mama on her mega behind. In short: Go to an Adult shop with movie booths, pay them 5$ and get exactly what you pay for! 5$ worth of dirty walls, bad acting and big moma's

This movie is a good movie. only way to enjoy it is not treat it as a Tomb Raider movie.SPOILERS
SPOILERS
SPOILERSTomb Raider fans - movies and games alike, know Tomb Raider is set in as a sci-fi, or maybe fantasy if you want, but it does not make lame excuses to give us the viewers/gamers the choice to believe whatever we chose.
moreover this movie, other than the cool airplane scene has no affiliation to the game it's ""based"" on.different story different events the whole intensety of the game and the climax of the end of the game - none of it was taken and it feels like a completly different and unrelated story.Personally i've been waiting for this movie since it was announced and i was very disappointed.
I feel like it's always a struggle when studios make a movie after a game (also vice-versa) but it feels like they didn't go the right way this time.i did give it 5 stars because it's not a bad movie and i think that if i would've watched it as it is and not as i was hoping a Tomb Raider movie will be, the experience could've been much better.",Tomb Raider

If you've never played video games like Tomb Raider (or Uncharted because that scene felt a ton like an Uncharted level) then you don't fully appreciate this scene and other shots in the movie.

She is fragile, she occasionally broke, she is not that all-knowing archaeology genius, she didn't start with ""Croft-Tech"" gadgets, etcShe also isn't another ""typical bad-ass female protagonist"" such as Alice of Resident Evil, Selena of Underworld, etc. There is something of her that broke all those previous stereotypes.Story is true to the game (2013 version)With the downfall of assassin's creed, repetitive Resident Evil, too-much-CGI warcraft, and that weird Need-For-Speed, this may be the best video game based movie for the decade.Alicia Vikander :)Bad :
Pace is too fast. She went from bike courier to sailor to shooting people with arrows in a duration that feels like a day for the audience. It would be nice if when she landed on the island, she must spend days just to learn basic survival, ""Cast-Away"" styleAside from Lara, other characters are poorly written.

I loved the old ones and I love the reboot. 
Now we have a new Movie and I enjoyed it greatly. The story differs from the game, but many scenes a gamer had played are in the movie. And this is important. 
The action is good, the story is okay and in the end I wish for a sequel. Pocorn cinema with a good actress,",Tomb Raider
1232,odyssus-12093,Not a Tomb Raider,1,16 March 2018,"It was obvious that Alicia Vikander will not make a good Lara Croft not only the looks but also the necessary skills so we ended up with a mess of a movie 
people who are not familiar with Tomb Raider might like it but for people who knows what is Tomb Raider and Lara Croft will be disappointed and stick with the game 
out of all Tomb Raider movies this is the worst , good luck next time",Tomb Raider
1233,lichcoin,A thrilling ride even for people that are not familiar with Tomb Raider,10,16 March 2018,"As the title suggests, I am going to be writing this review as someone that had never played the Tomb Raider games or watched the previous films that starred Angelina Jolie. Mild spoilers ahead: The Good:While I can't really compare Alicia Vikander's performance as Lara Croft with that of Angelina Jolie, I have to say that I think she did an amazing job. She commanded my attention every step of the way. Plus, I have read reports stating that she did a lot of physical training to prepare for this action packed role so that she could do most of her stunts herself. That's something that always increases my respect for the actor/actress in question and I feel there was a lot to like from her performance in this movie.There weren't any weak side plots dragging the storyline down. It was a straight path from the start and the intensity made me care and worry for the characters I was rooting for.I enjoyed the style of cinematography more than several blockbusters I have seen that had a budget of 150-200 millions and the budget of this one didn't even reach the 100 million. There were plenty of scenes that were beautifully shot and CGI was kept to a minimum from what I could tell. Many moviegoers that dislike the prevalence of CGI fests in most blockbuster movies may find that refreshing.The Bad:While it was clearly established that Lara Croft was a very fit woman and her actress definitely worked hard to look the part, there were a few times where I thought that the injuries she was acumulating should have been wearing her down more visibly. That suspension of disbelief slightly took me out of the story.I think Lu Ren's motivation for trying to save Lara despite the clear risks both to him and his fellow countrymen could have been handled better. Don't get me wrong, I could tell they bonded somewhat but he was quite afraid of those dangerous waters as it was and only accepted to take her to the island where his father was murdered in cold blood because she was paying him well and he had considerable gambling debts. Then things get from exteremely bad to downright deadly between the shipwreak to getting stranded on the island to being enslaved by mercenaries to getting shot at a lot when they tried to escape. I am not so sure they bonded well enough for him to wait for her that long considering the circumstances. Besides, the fact the helicopter could arrive at any moment reinforced their need to prepare an ambush so that they could hijacked the only transport that was going to get there anytime soon. To be fair, however, maybe I am overthinking it. His motivation could have simply been the desire to get closure for his father's disapperance and subsequent murder by seeing this through to the end. Payback can be a powerful motivator after all.The Great:I am happy to report that this is the very best video game to movie adaptation I have ever seen. True, the bar for that is admittedly quite low but its great to see a work of high quality emerge from that genre. And even if it wasn't a video game adaptation it would have still been a very well crafted action/adventure film with a stellar leading actress to boot, a fitting climax and plot twists that take you by surprise while still making sense.As a person that has never played the games or seen the older movies, I can't make objective compariasons in terms of quality as of this point. But as someone that enjoys watching movies very much, I can say that this franchise gained a new fan because of this film and his name is Diego Feliu. And I truly hope it does well in the Box Office because I really want to see more of Alicia Vikander as Lara Croft. In the meantime, I will give the 2013 Tomb Raider video game a shot.",Tomb Raider
1234,rushtontv,Not bad at all. (Spoiler Free),7,17 March 2018,"Firstly, this movie isn't going to be winning any Oscars, but it was never going to.We'd all love to see Roar Uthaug go down the route of Batman Begins and take the Lara Croft character and make her real... in a real wold adaptation. While that is the direction this film has gone, there are still a few scenes where you have to let it off the hook for throwing some video game-like superhuman leap or fall.That's probably the biggest disappointment for me with this film. Cinema surely learned from Nolan's Dark Knight series that if you break away from these ideas that a comic book character has to operate in a comic book reality, or in this case a video game character has to operate in a video game reality then you're onto the right path. All this you can tell from the trailer, which I thought made the film look awful.After you accept the fact Alicia Vikander has the leap and grip strength of the Lara character in the video game this movie really isn't bad.The main villain played by Walton Goggins is a little weak, so too is some of the dialogue. Particularly during the middle third where the pace of the film slows a little.Other than that though, this movie is great to watch. The Plot is a little of a mashup between Raiders of the lost Ark, Last Crusade and Kong.You enjoy watching the film, sure you have to be patient at times but the action sequences are decent and some of them really tense.Alicia Vikander is excellent! She's so good in fact, that my irritations with this movie are multiplied because they really have something here. This girl delivers a fantastic young Lara and it could have been Cinema magic, and pave the way for other video game characters to make waves in the movie world.Tomb Raider is definitely worth a watch. Even if you don't like the rest of the movie, Alicia Vikander being on screen for a couple hours will definitely get you through.",Tomb Raider

1237,lonelybologna,Marvellous Cast! Movie itself? *cough*.. not so much..,6,18 March 2018,"While the actors and actresses were marvellous; this movie however, was just unremarkable and dull. The scenes of the movie were all too predictable and clichéd. For example, the main character loses a parent figure, and the said figure is thought to be dead. The character then finds something that was left by the parent figure, (in addition to the notes that are also found). He also discovers that the parent left for the sake of discovering something (or the like.) So, of course, the protagonist decides to go rescue the parent (or at least find out of what happened).Sound familiar? Of course it does, that's what happens in every other stereotypical adventure movie! The only difference this time is that, instead of trying to make up for the weak plot, this movie makes use of characters who are flat, uninspiring, and, (just like the plot), clichéd.We have the main character, Lara Croft, the flawless heroine of the story, who somehow surpasses other characters who have far more experience than she. She is brave and truly loves her father; but, because of her love (and ignorance), ends up wasting her brain! Then we have Mathias Vogel, main baddie, who's motivation is (as directly stated in the film), missing his home. (*Cringe* Like we haven't seen this a million times before). Yet, instead of trying to make use of this to further bring life and complexity to this character, this motive is just seemingly abandoned, and he's left to be as unlikable and dreary for a character to get. I could go on forever, about how unoriginal and drab these characters are; but, truly, no one has enough time for that. Overall, despite the basic plot, character, and conflict, it wasn't a horrible movie; but, it most certainly won't be of help in improving the reputation of the game-turned-movie franchises. So, go ahead and watch the movie if you're a big fan of the video games; other than that, just skip this film, have no worries though, it's not as if you're missing anything new.",Tomb Raider

I hoped it would be half way decent, but let's be real, video game adaptations don't have the best track record. But Tomb Raider exceeded my expectations! It was REALLY good! This is a solid action adventure film in the vein of Indiana Jones meets National Treasure meets the Hunger Games. It's a fun time. You don't have to know anything about the character in order to enjoy it... but if you DO love the game series, you are in for a real treat. THIS is how you do VG adaptations.The acting is top notch and a big reason this film succeeds. Combine that with a fast pace, good world building, solid supporting characters, and the bravery to NOT jump the shark with the story... and you have a winning combo on your hands.Some critics are really hilarious for not knowing the source material of this movie. The plot is based on reboot game developed by crystal dynamic, not a copy of original movie.",Tomb Raider

This movies deserves to be watched atleast once in my opinion.",Tomb Raider
1242,kundza,Another closeup+shakycam flick,1,19 March 2018,"This recent sick trend needs to end some time. Directors using extreme closeups and shaky camera during ANY action sequence, only to disguise poor set decorations and lame action sequences has been a trend since the last decade or two. They just do not realize, that the audience is tired of twisting their eyes and fighting vertigo feelings whilst trying to understand what is going on the screen.Alicia Vikander is a great professional actress with a lot of sophistication, but she is definitely NOT Lara Croft - and I mean here not only some of the stereotype ""characteristic features"" of the heroine, but in general - the way she moves, reacts, takes decision, fights... This is not Lara we know from the game(s) and wanna see personified. If this was just one of those ""look-a-likes"" i would give it 4 or even 5 stars; but since it claims to be THE Lara Croft, I give it only one - for the simple reason that it is just NOT.",Tomb Raider

I really enjoyed the fact that they were showing us Lara before she became who she is today. I like how they were taken things from the game, but also adding their own spin to it. Lara didn't want here inheritance, which was amazing! Alicia played an amazing Lara! The way Alicia showed emotions, after killing her first man, made her seem human! The action in the film was incredible! The puzzles was perfect! Not too long, but just enough for us to get a feel of the actual Lara games! Don't get me wrong, I loved the first tomb raider movies, there just wasn't any puzzle scenes. I'm a huge fan of Tomb Raider, I've been playing these games for years.

1246,mmg-41554,Alicia Vikander is the female action hero I've always wanted,9,20 March 2018,"I want to begin this review by saying I have played the video game that this movie is based on, and while I obviously wish there were more aspects of the game included in the movie, I also acknowledge how difficult it is to compress 10+ hours of game story into a 2 hour movie, and I personally think that they did an excellent job including what they could. Secondly, I've seen a lot of negative reviews hinged on the fact that Croft seems to be able to overcome her injuries and perform various stunts without difficulty. And while that is clearly unrealistic, we are talking about an action movie, and a Lara Croft movie at that. Superhuman abilities is something that action movies like this rely on time and time again, including the original Lara Croft series with Angelina Jolie.*SPOILERS BELOW*What I absolutely love about this movie is that, as an origin story, it does a very solid job giving us background as to why she has the strength and ability to survive the obstacles she faces on her upcoming adventure. The opening scene of her boxing, even though she loses, shows that not only is she physically fit (ABS!!!!!), but she is resilient, and not willing to go down without a fight. The scene with the bike chase shows that she's fast, cunning, clever, and daring. And the fact that she works as a bike courier when she clearly has easy access to her father's fortune shows that she wants to stand on her own and make a name for herself. These are all traits that are going to serve her well in the rest of the movie. The beginning act of the movie does a tremendous job building up Croft's character an credibility to be able to survive the rest of the movie on her own. The rest of the movie follows a fairly simple plot, as many critics of the movie have pointed out, but I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. The plot works, it establishes the relationship between Lara and her father, builds her credibility as an adventurer, and brings her to the island where she is inevitably confronted with the death of her father, finally solidifying her transition into the Lara Croft character we've come to know in the past (or future, in the world of this film). A more convoluted plot would not have been necessary or even really served to further the credibility of the movie. Finally, Alicia Vikander's performance as Lara Croft left absolutely nothing to be desired. I know many people were hesitant when it was announced that she was cast as the lead, but she delivered an incredible portrayal of a difficult role. She was strong, sincere, funny, sassy, and genuine, and she really threw herself into the role in a way I didn't expect. In the scene when she has to remove the metal shrapnel from her stomach, you can really read every ounce of pain she's experiencing. In the scene where she's alone in the jungle in the rain and is attacked, and has to kill her attacker, you believe it is the first time she has killed someone, and you can feel the toll it takes on her. Vikander makes you feel everything along with her, which is part of the reason why I don't mind the ""simple"" plot, because I was never bored. I was entertained the entire movie. My few gripes with this film are that as a PG-13 rated action film, I didn't get to see as much gore as I would have liked, but that's a personal preference. I wish her male counterpart had a bigger role, he seemed to just kind of take her to the island and then disappear. He didn't play much of a part in the story other than getting her to the island. And of course, there's a few cheesy lines I could have lived without. But ultimately, I grew up as a young girl who loved action films, and I never had a female action hero like this to look up to. One who didn't rely on a man at some point or another, who could save the day all on her own. Alicia Vikander's Lara Croft is the female action hero I've always wanted, the one I wish I had when I was growing up. This is an extremely entertaining movie, go see it.",Tomb Raider

This is a new version of Lara inspired in the 2013 game, but even more badass. Lara is a lost girl, she doesn't know what to do with her life. She wants to forge her own path and solve some family matters. This is the emotional part of the movie, which I liked. Alicia pulls off an amazing performance through action sequences and sentimental parts of the movie. She is very beautiful and brave. The adventure element is in the second half of the movie and it doesn't take a second to rest. I was intrigued the whole movie and I find the result very satisfying.

1252,nnelynje,"Cliche at best, character development-wise",4,20 March 2018,"The character development of Lara Croft reminds me of the female lead in the recent Star Wars movies. Conceptually, they are the same. To reiterate a valid point from another reviewer, the character is infallible. This makes the entire film predictable, in other words, if you think Lara is going to solve a complex puzzle then of course she will. She lacks dimension as a character in general, and it's boring. I don't think the film was boring (and I usually get bored with origin movies as they start fairly slowly). Lara is just a boring mary sue character, and I see this trending in mainstream films.All this being said, it was an entertaining movie, but if you can't stand the same old Hollywood blockbuster where things fall into place for the main character to accomplish what is needed, then move forward and skip this title.",Tomb Raider

Odd choices like making me root for the villain as his purpose for his actions make sense and are understandable. The beginning of the movie probably didn't have to be in there, and should have started the way the game did on the boat. Should've also ended like the game as well, probably. The setup for the next film felt a bit off, but thanks for not making me wait till after the credits for it. And I felt the movie should've been titled something else besides Tomb Raider. Like Lara Croft, or something. Overall, I thought the movie was good and hopes it does alright. Here's hoping we get more tombs in the next one.",Tomb Raider
1254,ryansigward,"""I'm not that kind of Croft,""",7,21 March 2018,"This iteration of Lara Croft's story follows closely to the 2013 game of the same name, produced by Square Enix, by throwing a smart, rebellious, young Lara, played by Alicia Vikander, onto an uninhabited island off the coast of Japan in the search of a tomb belonging to an Empress. Beyond the characters, locations and the general idea of the story, the connections between this movie and the award-winning game become very far between. This is for the better as it allows the movie to stand alone and become its own thing, unlike other game-to-movies of recent that try to stick too close to their original source material. You can watch this movie as a standalone movie, almost forgetting it was once a game.This time round Lara is shown as a East Londoner who is quickly dragged head first into a dangerous crusade after receiving a puzzle from her late father. From here on there are many similarities to the Indiana Jones movies, starring Harrison Ford, which many would see as a negative, however that is how Lara Croft started off in the early 1996 video game and continues to be within the series, and is more of a statement to what makes Tomb Raider.This movie also removes most of the supernatural elements of the 2013 game for a more realistic interpretation of myths, which at some points can seem understandable and interesting, but mostly come across as blunt and under developed. In exchange we get a more typical action flick, where even a simple bicycle race becomes a James Bond style chase scene and Lara spending most of the movie running only to stop for brief moments of dialog, which makes for a fast-paced, adrenaline fueled adventure... that lacks depth.Alicia Vikander does a good job at bringing Lara Croft to life and with more development could be a very likable character, Kristin Scott Thomas as Lara's guardian doesn't get much screen time and her only real purpose is to push the story on, which will also lead to a sequel (if it does well at the box office) and Walton Goggins as the villain comes across as dull but with an interesting backstory, if you look for it.Overall, this is not going to be the best movie of 2018 and for sure will not be for everyone. Whenever it starts to get interesting it begins to level out and never peaks but for all its faults it's still an enjoyable movie and could be one of the better game-to-movies to date.7/10 - Interesting but lacking punch",Tomb Raider
1255,lewisowens-33177,Great movie if you've played the games!,10,21 March 2018,I really enjoyed this movie. Since I've also played the games I've come to appreciate this movie more. I definitely recommend to play the video games before or even after watching this movie.,Tomb Raider
1256,Edming,A Great Video Game to Movie adaptation,8,21 March 2018,"For starters, Alicia Vikander is just great playing Lara. She is easily the best thing about the film. She manages to play a innocent Lara, but at the same, combining her with confidence and persistance, unlike the first few hours of Tomb Raider 2013. The supporting characters were also very well acted throught, but I found Mathias to be a little bit irritating and empty.
Not like many other video games to film adaptations, this one is very truthful to it's original material, in what it touches especially to the characters.
The story is very competent throught the film's runtime, leaving you always anxious to know what it has too offer you next.It draws many inspiration from the Tomb Raider 2013 Reboot and that is just great, but sadly many plot holes are in it too, leading up to the movie's biggest flaw. Although, this the biggest problem of the film, in my oppinion, I won't enter into details, because that would make me go into Spoiler territory, something that I want to avoid.
Another thing I that I found a bit weak was the soundtrack. Compared with the reboot, I found the OST to be very predictable and too Hollywood, thus, not attempting to be creative.
I also found the CG elements to be quite well done and not very noticable, considering also the film's budget.
I found this new movie to be quite the step up in video games to movies adaption. It has some flaws and it's not a monumental film also, but for many fans and action movies' enthusiasts it's a must!

1263,bdumonthier,Fun movie,7,28 March 2018,"As a Tomb Raider fan I was looking forward to this movie and really enjoyed watching it. Alicia Vikander plays in my opinion a great Lara Croft. I enjoyed the goofy/sexy Angelina Jolie versions, but Vikander makes for a much more believable Lara. Vikander looks very fit, athletic and agile, so a lot of the things she does in the movie seem possible. Jolie's gigantic breasts were fun, but must be very impractical when one is fighting, hitting walls, falling flat on their face... Vikander makes you want to be friends with Lara whereas Jolie made her look intimidating and full of herself.The movie tells an origin story of Lara Croft becoming the Tomb Raider. So it's no surprise that the movie is all about her and only her. Actually I would say there are only two main characters. Lara and the villain Mathias. The other characters are nothing much more than props, and the anonymous Asian slaves are just part of the decor waiting to be shot at.Her father? Okay so this is why I took out two whole stars from my rating. Over half of the movie is overwhelmed by cheesy flashbacks to her childhood with her father which is irritating enough. They could have introduced him more subtly. But then it gets worse. Lara actually finds him alive on the Island of Yamatai where he survived god knows how for 7 years, though he was supposed to have been killed by Mathias himself (why would Mathias tell her that? we'll never know...). From then on their relationship looks like absolute rubbish. There is zero chemistry between the two, they just look bored, and at times pissed at each other. Him being alive actually really hurts the story. His character living was unnecessary as he is perfectly useless. His only feat are stupidly getting he and his daughter taken hostage by Mathias and setting off explosives on the tomb of Himiko, giving us one of the most boring ends to a mystical legend. He really should have been killed by Mathias years ago, and stayed dead. The acting is terrible and his lines are cringe worthy at best (""this trap was meant to keep us in, not out"" oookay...).Thank god this movie is full of gripping action. Lara gets beaten up really bad and very often (though less than in the game). The fight sequences are really well played, the river/plane/parachute scenes made the movie. Unfortunately the CGI was kind of weird at times, especially in the crashed plane scene, where the computerized decor looked more like a painting and the colors were off. Some scenes looked like they were pulled from a late 90s movie because of the poor graphics and odd color treatment which is disappointing in 2018. The movie already looks aged.I won't really comment much on the story line, it deviates from the game and that's fine with me. It's a movie of it's own. Or almost. Replace Trinity with Illuminati, Himiko with Pandora's Box and you get a mix of Lara Croft Tomb Raider and Lara Croft Tomb Raider: The Cradle Of Life. It works anyhow.
Though I admit I missed the wading through human remains in a river of blood part (but that wouldn't do for PG13 I suppose), the cult around Himiko, and also the survival aspect. Lara doesn't seem to be eating any food (or very very little) but still has the strength to climb walls barehanded, haul herself up with one hand, fight 250lb goons and run all day long. All the while being stressed like hell as she goes from one life-threatening situation to an other without rest.The shooting scenes are of course ridiculous. She gets fired at from 10 feet away by trained men carrying machine guns, but doesn't seem to need to duck, or change course to avoid the bullets as they magically pass by her. Hollywood doesn't seem to ever get bored with this. Anyway, this gives her plenty of time to shoot the guys with the brand spanking new looking (despite sitting in a cave for over 7 years) bow she stole from her dad. She is such a good shot that all men instantly crumple to the ground. She doesn't seem to find the need to retrieve her arrows either, as her supplies must be unlimited.The ending is in fact not an ending at all, it's really the beginning of a second film. But who knows if it will ever be made? the theater was more than half empty when I saw this movie which was sad. I actually went to the theater alone because nobody I know was interested in seeing this movie.The last scene is also ridiculous, where upon seeing guns, Vikander transforms into Angelina Jolie for a few seconds. Braded hair, dressed in black, lips all out, holding up two guns.Despite the flaws of this movie, I will certainly take two as well.",Tomb Raider

1266,winkleravi,Excellent movie from start to finish,9,31 March 2018,"I am a long time fan of the Tomb Raider video games, and enjoy the style of the recent video game reboots that's Square Enix has released. I went into this movie having only watched a teaser trailer and was pleasantly surprised to find that the movie was excellent. Films based on video are notorious for being ""bad"" and I am happy that this one did not disappoint. There was a perfect amount of character development and enough drama to keep you engaged. The action was top notch and felt like it was pulled right out the frames of the latest games. My only gripe with the film has to do with the fact that the diving of some of the puzzles I. The movie came a little to easily to Laura. However, I am not too bothered by this since the story needed to spent the time developing the characters. Personally I'll take that over showing us how she comes to solving the puzzles any day. I really hope this movie does well enough to warrant a sequel. It deserves it.",Tomb Raider
1267,hashashintag,"So, so, so bad but not even in a good way",1,2 April 2018,"This is my first ever review for IMDB. But if I manage to save just one person from watching this movie it'll be worth it.Everything was flimsy & implausible, irritatingly so. Even Alicia Vikander, usually awesome, managed to irritate with her constant little-girl squeals. The other characters were one-dimensional at best. The plot was pretty much non-existent. Lara's physical feats were ridiculous. The grand reveal of the contents of the tomb was a complete anti-climax. The escape was improbable and contrived. Just, just, everything was Bad.Rewatch the original Angelina Jolie version instead. Now that was actually fun.",Tomb Raider
1268,iamhanzomain,Greatest game adaptation this year.,9,2 April 2018,"I was pleasantly surprised with this movie. Being a mega Tomb Raider fan for the past 15 years now, I was worried how this movie would live up to the character of Lara Croft and her type of adventures.
However, after seeing this movie, I can proudly say it holds the Tomb Raider spirit and effectively portrays the new Lara Croft. Vikander's small intricacies in her performance really sold me on her Lara. The story was interesting and full of tense moments, and the visuals were top notch. Many of the action scenes were genuinely gripping. I was a bit disappointed with the big reveal of Queen Himiko's powers towards the end, it didn't have the oomph I was hoping for.
Overall, a fun, thrilling, well-acted video game movie that lives up to the franchise it comes from.",Tomb Raider

It was literally a checkbox list for everything that MPAA requires in a PG13 movies, and nothing more. It was as bland and as forgettable as every other similar title made since the 1980s. This plot has been regurgitated and spit out literally about a thousand times. There was such a minimalistic approach to even trying to spice up the formula that I dont even remember what was unique about it. if you're going to a movie and expect a nice steak for your $16, and you get this frozen hamburger, you should be able to demand your money back.

1274,captainskyyler,"Disappointing, especially when compared to the original Tomb Raider movies",5,31 May 2018,"I expected a more skilled, competent, and really tech-savvy Lara Croft to deliver high intensity action scenes that I had come to expect from previous Lara Croft movies. At least the actress portraying Lara Croft had an amazing body, and six pack abs that were seriously impressive. (Spoiler Alert!) However, the director decided to play up the more vulnerable side of Lara who is still mourning the loss of her father from seven years before and lives like a pauper because she refuses to access any of the wealth created by her father, and instead Lara is a take-out delivery carrier for an Indian restaurant. Really?!Also, I felt a number of scenes were over-the-top unrealistic. For instance, when Lara falls from the plane and is hugging a parachute that she opens mid fall and amazingly manages to hold on to said parachute until she reaches the ground. Sorry, but there is no way that would happen in reality because the g-force would have ripped that parachute right out of her hands upon opening. There is more, but maybe I am being too harsh because obviously many things done in the movie might be difficult if not impossible to accomplish in the real world, like healing from a nasty stomach wound in mere hours, so that she could accomplish incredible athletic feats that would strain even someone in top shape. Nevertheless, I felt the movie so under delivered that I would be hesitant to recommend it.",Tomb Raider

It may not come true to the games, BUT having played the latest installment, there is, in fact, a Miss Croft running around with a COMPOSITE bow. With NO scope whatsoever.Why implement her pistols if you don't need to? You might not rate this movie a 10, but I did. I watched it, and I deemed it to be a ten. Please remember that any review will always be biased. No question about it.This will surely not be the last adaption of sexy Miss Croft. And without spoiling it too much, maybe there is a chance that we will see Miss Croft use her double pistols in a later installment?

40 minutes in there is a melodramatic scene that lasts 20 second where the viewer is supposed to be wondering whether Lara is going to be shot point blank or not. That's not even passed half of the view-time, what person over 10 years old is supposed to feel anxious at any moment in this scene?

1291,dehdstar,"As a fan of the games, in my opinion this is the best re-adapted game-to-movie...but...",7,4 June 2018,"There are some key differences from the game I wish they would have kept, as it added diversity to the story, and didn't make it completely all about Lara. For instance there was Jonah, a very dear friend to Lara. He accompanies here most everywhere she goes, and acts as her rational mind. He accompanies her even when he thinks that she is becoming to dangerously obsessed, like her father. He is possibly the only one that believes her when all else figures Lara has inherited her father's sickness and imagining the impossible. Jonah is often a wild card when least expected. Ultimately Lara's excavation and ship crew presents to her ultimatums that often lead her down the best path for her well being, and serves to show her just how much some things aren't worth the cost, despite how obsessed she has been. Other crew member are good friend, Roth, who she jokingly referred to as ""northern bastard (funny because she from London)"" and who serves as Lara's father figure, lead archaeologist, James Whitman, who Lara is constantly contradicting and who eventually becomes a sub-villain, Sam another dear friend to Lara, and ancestor to none other than ""Himico!"" You can imagine she is a key character in that version of the story. There are a couple others, each with their own specializations.That said, enough about the friends. What about Lara's education? Yep! They took that away, too, in favor of a tougher, law-breaking street girl..Lara followed in her father's footsteps and was educated as a result. She wasn't resentful, pissed, and a perceived drop-out, even though it's not directly mentioned. The movie Lara reminded me a lot of Sam Flynn, from Tron... A bright-minded, college drop-out with a lot of potential and who rebels because dad never returned. The likely story arc decision. Most certainly not Lara. Lara was an archaeologist and was by the time she set out in search for Himico, though she did with a lead archaeologist accompanying her. Tomb Raider wasn't some ""I'm going to go pawn off everything dear to me and find some washed up sailor on a rusting bucket and find out about my father"" scenario, and she most certainly wasn't a mixed martial artist...that was more like old school Lara. The whole point of Reboot Lara is that she wasn't a cocky fighter, she was educated, and everything that makes her into what she eventually becomes was a bi-product of traumatic events. That brings me to my third point. From the time Lara ends up shipwrecked, in the game, she is attacked in ways that suggest rape, and food (cannibals), via, savage islanders who have been stranded much too long, and whom have just killed the last of their women in the name of resurrecting Himico. There were no savage cultists in this film. Just Trinity soldiers who have gone made with time, imprisoned on the island. The story was much better when these cultists were the threat, and there was mystery as to what their history and origins were. Sure, some may have been Trinity from back in Lara's father's time, but the fact they have gone native and found worship in an ancient evil was thrilling. And what of the immortal army of Himico? This would have given it that Indian Jones/ The Mummy appeal.",Tomb Raider

1306,autumn_seed,A very nice take on it,9,22 July 2018,"First, I would like to say don't listen to all those Angelina fan-boys. If you go in expecting this to be like that then you will be disappointed. Since there is a huge lack of sexual perversion in this film. People nowadays have become so obsessed with watching women revealing their sexual nature, that anything without it is immediately bombarded with criticism. There is no swearing, or foul language as well which makes this a highly recommended film for families. Story is the only part where I can point out some major mistakes without spoilers of course. I believe she could have made a better decision with the families company in the start than what she actually did. This is basically Tomb Raider reborn. It shows how she actually got in to it. So don't expect a special forces trained ninja warrior lady. And I think the actress did a wonderful job in portraying the fear and anxiety that comes with such situations that are presented. Not to mention her imagination of 3D space is quite good since most of the time she is tackling CGI material but makes it look quite real. Again, most people criticizing her here have probably never left their bedrooms in their lives. As far as it being similar to the game. Well yes it is. But I enjoyed how different parts of the game were put together and were revealed unexpectedly. It gave me a sense of good nostalgia. Cinematography and the camera work was absolutely lovely and made you feel like you were part of it. Little to no unnecessary breaks, and environmental shots were beautifully scripted. Overall, a very nice film. And a movie that I enjoyed after a long time of rubbish that is thrown out by the entertainment industry.",Tomb Raider

1314,alphabat-14014,Missed potential especially in casting.,3,7 September 2018,"This movie is based off of the 2013 reboot of the game franchise which since then A week from the time of this writing will be a trilogy of the reboot in gaming. For those who do not know this trilogy is basically the origin story of how Lara croft became who she is. Camilla Ludington (Dr. Joe Wilson Grey's Anatomy) does the voice acting and motion capture for Lara in all 3 games. And she does a phenomenal A+ job, she really sets the tone for the new croft. However this movie is an adaptation of the first game in the trilogy. Alicia Vikander did a decent job and you can tell she worked hard to play the part , but her portrail, the emotion and the rawness just cannot competewith what Camilla luddington established in the game. Matthias in the game was creepy and believable as a cult leader. Matthias in the movie was subpar at best and unbelievable. If you played the game you will notice the grave differences between the storyline of the game and the movie even though it's based on the same idea. Now I understand that this movie was a couple hours long and the story for the game was about 20 hours so obviously you can only fit so much into a smaller time span, but they butchered the story there was way too much unnecessary parts to her journey in the movie , when they could have forged her personality a little more and made the story more believable and closer to that of the game . Richard Craft is dead in the remakes Of the game, so I have no idea why they would make him alive and the movie it doesn't serve a real purpose because his death is what drives Laur of the game, so I have no idea why they would make him alive and the movie it doesn't serve a real purpose because his death is what drives Lara to defeat Trinity and to complete her father's work. Camilla luddington should have been cast as Lara. Supposedly the reason she was not was by the time they decided they wanted to film she was pregnant . But honestly I think they should have waited because even if they kept the same mediocre story, Lara's Portrayal would have been A lot more sincere and believable considering Camilla Has spent the last seven years playing that role. For hard-core enthusiasts this movie is barely watchable for people who don't know about the new games it may be passible. But honestly I think it's a slap in the face to the tomb raider community and to the developers at crystal dynamics and eideos Montreal Who strive so hard to make such a phenomenal series , I think it's also a slap in the face to Camilla Luddington Who has made Lara Croft what she is, she IS Lara Croft. Alicia Vikander is probably the best alternative But she is not Lara. If you are a tomb raider fan but have not seen this movie don't even bother , you will be disappointed, angry and triggered by the in accuracies and film pacing. Only watch this movie if it was free and if you are bored.",Tomb Raider

For example, I loved Jupiter Ascending.Now, I can say I absolutely hated Tomb Raider. I hated this Lara Croft as much as I hated Angelina Jolie's version. I'll give a list for my reasons why:Croft is a broke dropout who can't win a wrestling match (how do you set the scene for a tough badass girl if she can't win one fight against another girl?!)Not only does she not do the ONE thing her father asked her to do (ie, burn the Himiko notes); she also does exactly what he would've died to prevent (ie, Vogel obtaining them).How the frick does she go from a dumbass second-rate fighter with rusty-ass school-girl-level archery skills to this supposedly badass chick able to take on trained Mercs with nothing but a bow and arrow??Despite knowing her father was willing to sacrifice himself to keep Himiko hidden, she let them in anyways (she's pretty much the reason he died and almost set loose a plague)The scripting was rubbish (talk about predictable and cheesy) and what was with that stupid two finger kissing salute?! Who does that in real life?!She pawned the amulet?? The one keepsake from her father? I would understand it if she was desperate, but SHE IS LITERALLY WEALTHY.There is absolutely no way her stupid arrow would've pierced a friggin combat helicopter.She finds one stupid letter about Lu Ren and a boat (really?!) and suddenly she's in Hong Kong and oh wow, there he is! Like magic! Because Hong Kong is just a tiny village with only one guy named Lu Ren.I'm sure there is more I hated about this movie, but I can't think of it now. The whole thing was absolutely ridiculous and entirely beyond the realm of reason. I can accept some creative license, but this was just ridiculous. I would've been more inclined to believe any of it had they stayed true to the original and she had used her wealth to train herself physically and make connections.",Tomb Raider
1316,duchesswinter,"It's Alicia Vikander's story, it is not Tomb Raider",2,22 September 2018,"I am an avid gamer of the original Tomb Raider series and to be fair, it could be the game developers' decision to do a massive reboot/overhaul that doesn't do any good for the entire Tomb Raider story. I am biased because I alaready hate the recent games in that young Lara Croft looked like a helpless, naive lady who happened to just survive because that part of that cliff she jumped and hooked her ice tool onto remained intact; that she happened to have a parachute right in front of her face when she was about to fall from an airplane wreck; or that she happened to be washed ashore when they ship was capsized by storm; there are no mysteries and puzzles here, it lacks suspense and vibrant story telling. The movie is even worst that the game itself.I read a very short epic review about this film saying ""The movie isn't about Lara Croft, not her adventures, not the history...it is about Alicia Vikander."" This sums up all my feelings about the film in that I didn't feel any deja vu while watching it. Being someone who played every single Tomb Raider games out there (and hating the last few ones that are part of the reboot), Alicia Vikander looked like she just stepped out of the movie Ex Machina, forgetting that she is supposed to be the face of the game Tomb Raider reboot.I really miss the genuine Tomb Raider epic explorations and relic hunting. I suppose the best way to know the real story, if you happen to love the Lara Croft from movies is to play the game as Lara Croft. The game gives you sense of power, awakens your deeper sense for exploration and archeaology, etc. None of these were in the film, so I pray there isn't a sequel after all this unless it is someone who knows what real tomb raider is. I was looking forward to this as I really like Alicia Vikander from Ex Machina and other movies where she appeared on. This movie is very poorly done, the casting could have been better and there could have been a better actress of Lara Croft for this film. When it was Angelina Jolie, the game character could have even attended the filming and applauded her for her perfect representation of the femme fatale: kickass, beautiful, rich, wise and everrything you could think as a perfect female explorer. This would probably pass for people who havent experienced the original games. This one is a let down for me. Sorry I really have to say there.",Tomb Raider
1317,cookbyron,Yes could have been better.,5,2 October 2018,"To follow a actor in any move is quite hard, this was a good movement towards a next raider. Most will see just a plane movie as it is however it will please most as they wanted just action not a plot.This leads you now into a new raider from the start, give it a chance you might enjoy it.",Tomb Raider
1318,christycota,Fun feirce and wicked ending!,10,29 January 2019,"So enjoyed this more humble Laura Croft! The story is fantastic! I had no lingering qustions, except, when is the nect installment of this wicked story?",Tomb Raider
1319,andreascovex,Not a lara croft that I want,5,2 November 2018,"A little disappointed with the character who plays the role of lara croft, I hope more than angelina jolie in this movie, the character is whiny and in my opinion looks not too strong enough for a lara croft",Tomb Raider
1320,dragos-62079,Fills out time...,3,10 November 2018,"Movie overall isn't bad,but c'mon guys is 2018 and still having her clothes and hair dry right after she gets out of the water...you gonna have to try better",Tomb Raider
1321,mariananton-18885,Don't even consider the bad reviews!,8,23 November 2018,"This is by far the best Tomb Rider movie so just relax and enjoy. Comparing with those cheesy Jolie versions this is absolutly great. Alicia is an wonderful Lara, real life character not that hollycrapwood stereotype and despite some moments of predictibility, the movie is really good. Disregard those pretentiouse reviews from people who wants you to think that they are so cultivated that only art movies can touch their intelect and you'll have a really pleasant movie to watch.",Tomb Raider
1322,bradflinn,Sadly Uninteresting,4,25 November 2018,I honestly forgot I had this movie playing. A loud action scene would remind me; I'd glance over and then go right back to reddit.,Tomb Raider
1323,ebtv,"another mindless reboot with class C acting - yes, another one of those.",3,25 November 2018,"Turn ur brain off and don't try to think ... you might like it.
Stop thinking that acting is supposed to be good.. and you might like it.
Basically, revert yourself to 5 yrs old and watch... then you might like it.",Tomb Raider
1324,bupmaster,losing brain cells here,2,3 December 2018,"I actually thought that this would be a action-packed movie, but it was filled with cliches and a rudimentary plot. The movie was very easy to predict, and the backstory wasn't needed. There is really no character development and most of the first part was slow and boring.The casting for the movie was pretty good, but the script and the story were boring and are like almost any other movie. The only difference between those movies and this one is that the characters are lifelike and actually change.The special effects were okay, but I wish they had paid more attention to detail to make the movie more believable.I usually don't write reviews, but I had to do this for the community. Definitely not worth it.
TL;DR please dont watch this movie im already losing brain cells writting thiis",Tomb Raider
1325,evelincostagrace,Loved it,10,8 January 2019,So much better than expected I really hope they make a second movie 🙏🏻🙏🏻,Tomb Raider

1327,chrissmith-54519,It's ok but not as good as the previous Angelina Jolie films,4,12 February 2019,It's ok but not as good as the previous Angelina Jolie films. Would not have paid to watch this at the cinema but it's ok to watch for a couple hours on Netflix. Reminded me of one of those made for TV films on the Syfy channel.,Tomb Raider
1328,dinoylopez,accepted less due less rating but filim was Good,8,15 February 2019,"Its a great movie rated less,all cg were good Alicia vikander acted well overall good movie will watch second part if its released",Tomb Raider
1329,rsafa-37892,Insulting for people who are fan of this titles,2,16 February 2019,"Even though this movie came out several years ago, I resisted seeing it after seeing the preview. The girl is weak and miserable, complete opposite of Angelina Jolie. It's sad that the producers spent that much money and chose such a weak group of acts and actereses.",Tomb Raider
1330,normaandrade,Honest review,8,23 February 2019,"From what i've seen, this movie has been compared to the latest movies ""Lana Croft"" with Angelina Jolie a lot, but i think coudn't, ""Tomb Raider"" it's a great movie, the quality of the productions and script are really good and impressive. I simply love it.",Tomb Raider
