0,Leofwine_draca,Transformers spin-off is much of a muchness,4,1 January 2020,"BUMBLEBEE is the latest TRANSFORMERS movie and something smaller scale than the usual world-destroying nonsense served up by Michael Bay's main franchise. This one is more of a teen movie, following around a girl on the cusp of her 18th birthday as she takes part in various escapades and ends up adopting the titular robot. Of course, a squad of evil robot Decepticons turn up to wreak the usual havoc and mayhem, so it's not that different. This is definitely a film aimed at younger viewers and all of the human material left me cold. The CGI FX are as good as ever and the running time is pretty fast, which makes this quite a harmless watch, but it's hardly high art.",Bumblebee
1,SnoopyStyle,best of Transformers,8,25 January 2019,"The Autobots have been driven out of Cybertron by the Decepticons. Optimus Prime tasks B-127 to set up a safe haven on Earth for the Autobots to regroup. It's 1987 California. B-127 crash-lands and barely survives a Decepticon attack. Before losing his memory, he turns himself into a Volkswagen Beetle. Teen girl Charlie Watson (Hailee Steinfeld) is still struggling from her father's death. She fixes up the Beetle and is shocked by his transformation. She names him Bumblebee.Compared to the Bayformers, this one should win an Oscar. By herself, Steinfeld is infinitely better than any of the models that Michael Bay gets his butt shots. Megan Fox is the only real actress of the bunch. Enough said. We get away from the infantile By humor. I guess the first Bayformers was pretty good but the rest is a long, sad slough downwards. There are issues with the mean girls, the logic of the bots' looks before they get to Earth, and the possible overuse of music nostalgia. I do wonder if I'm grading on a curve. Maybe...",Bumblebee
2,Prismark10,Bumbles along,4,25 March 2019,"The Transformers movies seem to get worse with each new instalment.This prequel without Michael Bay as director goes back to basics.The Autobots need to leave planet Cybertron after a relentless assault by the Decepticons.Optimus Prime sends B-127 to planet Earth where the Autobots could find safe haven.B-127 lands in California 1987 bu the the Decepticon are on his tail as well as an army unit. B-127 is severely injured, loses his voice and memory. He turns into a Volkswagen Beetle and come across teenage misfit Charlie Watson (Hailee Steinfeld.)Charlie is first shocked when she finds that VW Beetle can transform into a robot but she forms a bond with the autobot she calls Bumblebee. Meanwhile Agent Burns (John Cena) initially perceives Bumblebee as a threat while the army generals trust the Decepticons when they first make contact.Director Travis Knight is good in making the action scenes flow like a cartoon. The story seems to be heavily influenced by those 1980s John Hughes teen movies such as Pretty in Pink and Some Kind of Wonderful. I think all the songs Charlie listens to are from British artists.Although leaner and meaner than the Transformer films, the action comes to a juddering halt when it concentrates on teenage angst and Charlie's family issues.",Bumblebee
3,claudio_carvalho,Prequel of The Transformers,6,7 April 2019,"After being defeated by the Decepticons on the war on Cybertron, the leader Optimus Prime sends B-127 to Earth to establish an Autobot outpost and protect Earth. B-127 surprises the training of a group of soldiers under the command of Colonel Jack Burns (John Cena) and flees. However he is ambushed by a Deception that damages his memories and voice. But B-127 defeats the enemy and transforms into a yellow 1967 Volkswagen Beetle.In 1987, the eighteen year-old Charlie Watson (Hailee Steinfeld) finds the Beetle in a junkyard and the owner Uncle Hank (Len Cariou) gives the car to her. The teenager is a great mechanic that misses her father and lives with her young brother and her estranged mother and her boyfriend. Charlie accidentally activates a signal and the Decepticons track B-127 down on Earth. Two Decepticons head to Earth to capture and destroy the Autobot convincing Dr. Powell (John Ortiz) and the army that they are peaceful and the enemy is a dangerous robot. Meanwhile Charlie befriends B-127 and calls him Bumblebee.""Bumblebee"" is the prequel and maybe the best film of the franchise ""The Transformers"". The film has the humor of ""The Love Bug"", magnificent special effects and is a great family entertainment. It is funny also the need of interracial couples used by the cinema industry in the present days. My vote is six.Title (Brazil): ""Bumblebee""",Bumblebee
4,nogodnomasters,That was radical,8,2 January 2019,"The film takes place in 1987. Good Cyber-trons vs evil Deceptors. Bumblebee is adopted by Charlie (Hailee Steinfeld) who is 18 going on 14 having issues since her father passed. Bumblebee helps her and she helps him.The music, TV, and girls were a lot better in 1987. While it was 1987, that meant any song released in a year with the number ""8"" in it was fair game to play in the soundtrack. The plot was geared for the ET crowd. It had more drama than robot fighting, unlike the other films. Would have been better if Megan Fox played the mother.",Bumblebee
5,kosmasp,The joy,7,6 May 2019,"Now I wasn't really sold on this prequel idea, then again I am not too familiar with the Transformers universe in general. But the joy the main character has here is more than infectious. The story is quite nicely told and there is quite a lot of warmth to it. Yes it is predictable and yes there are cliches abound, but it is compensated more than enough.Of course you can ruin the movie yourself by just making fun of it the whole time. And it has the material for you to exploit. But making that choice you only hurt yourself. Rather not watching it would be an option than going in with an attitude. Talking about attitude, having a female being the lead was about time! Especially about the sideline shows happening in the Bay Transformer incarnations! Nice touch - and overall a really good movie (I know shocking!)",Bumblebee
6,paul_haakonsen,"""Transformers"" as it is supposed to be...",7,20 January 2019,"Right, well the one and only reason for me sitting down to watch ""Bumblebee"" was because the rest of the family wanted to, so I gave in and joined them.Which, I must admit, that I am actually glad that I did. Because this spin off on the ""Transformers"" live action movies was actually the best in the entire franchise. Who knew? A spin off movie putting every other single ""Transformers"" movie to shame and outshines them by a mile.The story in ""Bumblebee"" was good, it had something for the entire family, because it contained action, comedy, love, and good vs evil. Everything that was required to entertain everyone in the family.What also worked in favor of the movie was the fact that they had acquired a proper cast for the roles - well, with the exception of John Cena, as I can't really claim that he fit the role in this movie. But everyone else was really cast nicely for their respective roles and characters.There is a good abundance of action in the movie, and it is done with elegance, whereas some of the movies in the actual main franchise seemed to focus more on just random destruction and violence, And the fact that there actually was a proper underlying storyline and plot to supported by the action just made it all the more enjoyable.It is difficult not to get drawn in and be swooped away by Bumblebee himself in this movie, whereas I didn't have quite the same feeling or reaction in the countless previous movies.This is actually how they should have started the entire franchise off, instead of giving us a continuous array of explosions and CGI bedazzlement. If you, like me, grew up watching the ""Transformers"" cartoons in your childhood, then you definitely should take the time to sit down and watch the 2018 ""Bumblebee"", because director Travis Knight really nailed it right on the head here.",Bumblebee

8,zardoz-13,"A Half-Baked Reboot of ""The Transformers"" Franchise",5,15 January 2019,"When a popular movie franchise loses traction with its core demographic, Hollywood's surefire strategy is to reboot. Indeed, producers find it easy to reboot, retool, and recast, with actors whose monetary demands aren't as astronomical. George Lucas rebooted his own ""Star Wars"" franchise. ""Star Trek"" rebooted. The James Bond movies rebooted with ""Casino Royale."" The live-action ""Spider-Man"" films rebooted twice! ""Superman"" rebooted twice as ""Superman Returns"" and then ""Man of Steel."" ""Planet of the Apes"" rebooted. ""Batman"" rebooted, too. Anybody who craved the first five, live-action, sci-fi, ""Transformers"" extravaganzas may find ""Bumblebee"" is not only lame but also tame. This attractively lensed, larger-than-life, estrogen-driven actioneer is essentially a chick flick. An outcast high school girl teams up with a 1967 Volkswagen Beetle (think Disney's ""Herbie"") and they fight save planet Earth from alien invaders. Right, Bumblebee disguises himself as the meek VW.Compared to Michael Bay's ""Transformers"" quintet, ""Bumblebee"" qualifies as a ramped-up afterschool special. A seventeen-year old girl who sells corndogs at a seaside snack bar hasn't conquered her grief over her father's death. Impatiently, she bides her time until she grows old enough to leave the nest and achieve autonomy and tackle the world on her own terms. Hailey Steinfeld, who played Mattie in the Cohen brothers' western remake ""True Grit,"" radiates charm and virtue as a virginal role model heroine. She is vulnerable, but she wins our respect without alienating us with her antics. Sure, if you were an E.T. or Bumblebee, what better friend could you find if you had just sought refuge on Earth? Mind you, ""Bumblebee"" evokes memories of Steven Spielberg's ""E.T.: The Extraterrestrial"" (1982) and the animated adventure ""The Iron Giant"" (1999). ""Kubo and The Two Strings"" director Travis Knight shuns rapid-fire, attention-deficit editing; scorching hot ""Victoria's Secret's"" models, death-defying aerobatics, and the Pentagon's arsenal of weapons. You need not have a scorecard to keep track of dozens of Autobots or the Decepticons. ""Unforgettable"" scenarist Christina Hodson's cookie-cutter screenplay is predictable pablum. Knight and she wallow in nostalgia, with scores of atmospheric Top-40 radio hit tunes as well as visual memorabilia like ""Alf."" Watching any of Michael Bay's ""Transformer"" movies felt like riding out Armageddon. Comparatively, ""Bumblebee"" has enough action escapades and robot fights, but nothing like the previous ""Transformers.""The prequel opens in distant galaxy on the planet Cybertron. The good guy robots--the Autobots-are losing in the Civil War to their despicable adversaries-the Decepticons. If you missed the five previous ""Transformers"" movies or the animated original ""The Transformers: The Movie"" (1986), you have a lot of catching-up ahead. Anyway, Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen of all ""Transformer"" movies) and his Autobots are in full retreat. Prime calls Autobot B-127 aside and dispatches him on a scouting mission to planet Earth. Prime plans for the Autobots to regroup on a peaceful planet. Inevitably, the Decepticons track Bumblebee. While Charlie struggles with Bumblebee to recover his voice, the Decepticons convince overconfident military generals that they can be trusted. Ultimately, Sector 7 Agent Burns (John Cena of ""Trainwreck"") realizes his colleagues have been misled. Moreover, B-127, nicknamed 'Bumblebee' by Charlie, isn't mankind's enemy. Incredibly, in all those high-octane, explosive robot battles, neither Burns nor his men suffer serious injury.When we meet our heroine, loner California high-school student Charlie Watson (a brunette Hailey Steinfeld), she is tooling around on an asthmatic moped. She still sulks over the unresolved issue of her dad's untimely death from a heart attack. Charlie's mom, Sally (Pamela Adlon of ""Grease 2""), has gotten over this tragedy and gotten remarried, to a clueless stud, Ron (Stephen Schneider of ""Relativity""), who also has a son Otis (Jason Drucker of ""Diary of a Wimpy Kid: The Long Haul""), to enliven matters. Worshipping her dear, departed dad, Charlie finds herself at odds with her new family. Wisely, Ron doesn't make an issue of Charlie's attitude. He does advise her to smile once and while. Indeed, for her eighteenth birthday, Ron gives her a self-help book about smiling. Ron's kindly advice falls on deaf ears.
Meantime, when she isn't selling corndogs, Charlie tinkers with a vintage Corvette she and her father had started to restore. This reminded me of ""Tomboy,"" a 1985 romantic comedy about a girl who was a grease monkey. Furthermore, Charlie had once been a champion high-diver, a sport her dad encouraged her to pursue. Now, however, with his passage, Charlie has lost enthusiasm for it. One day, while rummaging in her uncle's junkyard, Charlie stumbles onto the Beetle and convinces grumpy Uncle Hank (Len Cariou of ""Executive Decision"") to let her have it. He gives it to her as a birthday present. Charlie discovers there is more to this humble yellow VW than meets her eye. Bumblebee transforms himself from the vehicular VW Beetle into the fifteen-foot robot with self-awareness. Before he plunged to Earth, the Decepticons had captured him and sabotaged his voice box. Bumblebee avails himself of the VW's radio to learn how to converse in English with Charlie. Predictably, Knight and Hodson cannot resist infantile comic relief scenes of Bumblebee blundering about like a wrecking ball in Charlie's house and destroying everything in sight.Hopelessly scaled down in comparison with the previous five ""Transformers,"" ""Bumblebee"" is far easier to comprehend, especially the robotic acts of transformation. Watching humans turned into geysers of pancake syrup about as violent as it gets. Nevertheless, those incoherent, over-the-top predecessors that Michael Bay helmed were far funnier, particularly the Government agents and the dysfunctional Witwicky family. Suspense is singularly lacking. Perhaps the most objectionable thing about this reboot is the inherent flaw in most prequels. The cute protagonist-Bumblebee-cannot perish in his own 'origins' picture. Of course, our iron-clad hero gets the scrap kicked out of him. We know Bumblebee will triumph, but we know the Decepticons won't easily vanquished. Happily, the last stunt our Autobot hero performs in ""Bumblebee"" is shape-shifting into the yellow Camaro that Shia LaBeouf's character Sam Witwicky drove in ""Transformers.""",Bumblebee
9,view_and_review,Inept Military and a Robot Pet,3,11 November 2019,"In another movie where the U.S. military is weak, inept, and misinformed a young girl and her pet robot are there to fix everything.Bumblebee crashes to Earth from space right on a military training ground. The military acted swiftly and correctly by treating the alien invader as a hostile. Yes, I know the name of the movie is Bumblebee and I know that Bumblebee is an Autobot (aka a good guy), but I know that from years of watching Transformers. The military didn't have that knowledge.But because whenever the U.S. military is on the wrong side they are also totally inept, they failed to kill Bumblebee and they also joined forces with the Decepticons who arrived to Earth later.There was some teen drama thrown in there for kicks and grins and more of the U.S. military failing. Finally, Bumblebee and the girl save the planet from being destroyed. What a weak movie.",Bumblebee
10,neil-476,Hugely enjoyable,9,11 April 2020,"Optimus Prime, given that the Autobots are losing the Cybertron war against the Decepticons, sends junior soldier B127 to scout out Earth as a possible bolthole. In short order, B127 loses his memory and voice and, pursued by both Decepticons and Earth's armed forces, takes shelter in an autospares yard where he falls in with Charlie, a teenaged girl who has yet to come to terms with the death of her father.This prequel to the previous Transformers movie is much, much better than they are. It benefits hugely from the scared Bumblebee, deprived of memories and the ability to communicate, befriending and being befriended by the damaged Charlie. As they work together to try to keep Bee safe from the twin threats, so they begin to heal each other in a story which is both touching and funny as well as exciting.Hailee Steinfeld holds centre screen for the humans brilliantly, and Bumblebee conveys emotion far better than you would believe a CGI robot/VW Beetle ever could. Body language and facial animation is superb.In fact, all the CGI is superb - lessons have been learned because the battling robots are clearly identifiable and the action is far easier to follow than in earlier movies.This is the way to go with these movies.",Bumblebee
11,morrison-dylan-fan,The Iron Bumblebee.,8,12 September 2021,"After watching Emma Raducanu make history by becoming the first British woman in 44 years to win the US Women's Open in a thrilling final match,me and a pal felt like watching a breezy flick. Hearing praise about this title for a few years,it felt like the perfect time for us to meet Bumblebee.View on the film:Transforming from animation to live action for the first time, director Travis Knight brings his animators eye attention to detail to the Transformers franchise,which Knight & Europa Report (2013-also reviewed) cinematographer Enrique Chediak spin into a fresh new direction with excellent CGI sequences that in gliding panning shots capture each component that makes Bumblebee.Backed by choice cuts of late 80's Pop and indie Rock, Knight brings a real weight to the exciting explosive Action set-pieces with upwards push-in shots mapping out the perspective of people on the ground looking up at Bumblebee, which Knight superbly matches with a glowing Family Movie atmosphere from the surprisingly sweet panning shot sequences over fading colours of Charlie and Bumblebee bonding with each other.Acting to CGI for most of the runtime, Hailee Steinfeld gives a excellent performance as Charlie, whose empathy and determination to protect Bumblebee is given a real warmth by Steinfeld, whilst John Cena gives a animated snarling turn as the boo-hiss Agent Burns.Whilst the assembly point shows visible signs of The Iron Giant (1999), the screenplay by Christina Hodson joyfully bounces off the inspiration to unveil a coming of age Action tale, with a focus on Charlie mourning the loss of her dad, brilliantly heightening the Action,as Charlie fights to save her friend,by stopping Agent Burns from taking the sting out of Bumblebee.",Bumblebee
12,deloudelouvain,Too much cheesy moments.,6,14 May 2019,"From all the Transformers movies I would say this prequel was the one I least enjoyed. It's way too cheesy, with alot of long and pointless 'emotional' passages, mostly due to Hailee Steinfeld's interacting with Bumblebee. I'm not saying she's a bad actress but in this movie, after awhile, I was kind sick of her character. The movie has to have it from the combat scenes and in my opinion they are just too scarce . Bumblebee is a missed opportunity to make a good prequel about what happened before the Transformers came into action. Slightly disappointed!",Bumblebee
13,siderite,"After Michael Bay's sFX extravaganzas, a return to form: a kid oriented film actually based on the toy line",7,1 October 2020,"I have never played with the toys or read the comics, but I watched all of the Transformers movies. When Bumblebee came out I was fatigued and frankly disgusted with the quality of the franchise, so I just gave up. But after a comment from a blogger, saying that the film is not directed by Bay and that it's one of the best Transformers movies, I've decided to watch it. The verdict: a return to form. The action is set in the 80s, the effects look more mechanical and less CGI and the main character is a young girl. I find it befitting to what the franchise should have been from the very start.However, because of the timing, this is too little and too late. A lot of people did like I did and just flat out skipped the film, while others did not like it because they were coming for big explosions and special effects. Plus, to be honest, it wasn't that original or inspiring, using the same tired ""kid finds friendly alien"" plot and starring Hailee Steinfeld, who is very cute, but kind of one track when it comes to acting. Also the character of the neighbor was completely unnecessary.Bottom line: this should have been, perhaps, the first film in the franchise. It's not the best, but clearly a lot better than the latest movies in the series. Not sure where they will go from here, though.",Bumblebee
14,namashi_1,A Transformers Movie With Heart!,6,6 January 2019,"The Transformers Movies, lets be honest aren't movies that offer soul. Despite making over billions with the Michael Bay films, Transformers are often noted to be mindless, soulless blockbusters. But with a new Director calling the shots and the focus being on just one of the Transforming Heroes, 'Bumblebee' is a pleasant surprise, that is indeed a Transformers Movie with Heart!'Bumblebee' Synopsis: On the run in the year of 1987, Bumblebee finds refuge in a junkyard in a small Californian beach town. Charlie (Hailee Steinfeld), on the cusp of turning 18 and trying to find her place in the world, discovers Bumblebee, battle-scarred and broken.'Bumblebee' works because the film focuses more on emotion than on action. Sure, there is action here and there as it has to be, it's a Transformers movie after all, but what is served here, intelligently, is a story offering soul. The relationship of Bumblebee and Charlie, is the film's heart. I liked the way their relationship is built up and how the emotional connect works. It comes across as genuine, rather than manipulative. And that's where 'Bumblebee' scores, it's more about love and bond, rather than just mindless action.Of course, there are flaws. The biggest one being that this is a familiar story and the beats are predictable. And the entire E.T. vibe is hard ignore. But again these are manageable flaws, in an otherwise charming film.Christina Hodson's Screenplay is well-done. And it seems the Writer has been influenced hugely by the prolific John Hughes, since her story has flashes of the late/great genius's craft. Travis Knight's Direction is perfect. Cinematography, Editing, Art and Costume Design, are quite good. Graphics, as expected, are excellent.Performance-Wise: Hailee Steinfeld shines as Charlie. She plays the protagonist and her performance is completely likable. John Cena, in a role with grey shades, clearly has a ball. Jorge Lendeborg Jr. is cute. Pamela Adlon is superb as Charlie's mother. Of the vocal performances, Dylan O'Brien as the voice of B-127 / Bumblebee, Peter Cullen as the voice of Optimus Prime, Angela Bassett as the voice of Shatter and Justin Theroux as the voice of Dropkick, are pretty solid.On the whole, 'Bumblebee' is a charming film that brings back the Transformers franchise into the game.",Bumblebee
15,cherold,Love Bug meets Transformers and it kinda works,7,9 April 2019,"I didn't go into Bumblebee with high hopes. I haven't watched a Transformers movie since the entertaining but forgettable 2007 one, because all the ones since got terrible reviews. But this got better reviews, and I wanted something escapist.Set in the 80s, this movie aims for something like the Iron Giant, or E.T., as an angsty girl befriends an alien robot that can turn into a VW bug.The girl, Hailee Stanfield, is very good. I'm amazed at how well she handles the utterly ridiculous role of a teenager bonding with metal scrap. The robot is more appealing than those in the first movie, so that her affection seems warranted.The film is often funny and sometimes touching, but what weighs it down is, it's a Transformers movie. Bumblebee is stuck with a ridiculous, toy-inspired formula, and the entire robot-war thing is just laughable. If the producers had cut ties with the franchise and told the writer and director to just make whatever they wanted, it would have been a much better movie. Transformers is a ball and chain dragging down a rather lovely coming-of-age movie.That being said, the final big battle, which mixes in Transformers and humans, is surprisingly engaging. And the ending is genuinely touching.It's certainly not a great movie, but it's good enough to make you believe that the talent in this movie probably could make a great movie if they were let loose. I'd recommend it as long as you keep your expectations low.",Bumblebee
16,FeastMode,my notes,4,27 July 2019,"I might like this movie if i was 15. ""family friendly"" garbage ruined the movie. teenie bopper romance ruined the movie. they basically did the same thing as previous movies, the same thing everyone complained about, but went even younger and more high-school-y. smh. who makes these decisions.the movie started off amazingly. the first 20 minutes i was locked in and having a blast. and it slowly got worse and worse all the way to the end of the movie. so many cheesy moments and corny jokes. most of the jokes fail. the story is useless. the characters are lame. and did i say it was cheesy and corny? times ten.hailee steinfeld did a good job. the rest of the acting was pretty bad. the action was mostly good. but the movie around it failed to make me care about the stakes.this movie was better than the last two mark wahlburg trash movies. but they are nowhere near as good as the first three that everyone loves to hate on. i really don't understand how everyone hates on the original 3 but gave this one amazing reviews. baffling. those movies are flawed but they are super entertaining, whereas you will only like this movie if you are cool with high school dramas (1 viewing)

let's talk about some of the cliched moments. the crowd wants her to dive, but she's too scared, i wonder if that will come into play later. she likes the popular guy at school who's dating the bully, but that does not come into play at all lmao. the bullies!!! lmao the most cliched.

17,Robert_duder,Fun and simplifies the Transformers franchise,7,7 January 2019,"The first Transformers film was epic! One of the things that caused the franchise to go off the rails was they forgot to keep things simple. In subsequent films I'm not even sure what was happening in some of them. They ballooned to three plus hours long and were all over the place. Bumblebee looked to simplify that and take it back to it's roots and it does that! Setting it as a prequel in the 1980's fits perfectly although the time period doesn't play a huge role in the film except for the soundtrack. Instead of Transformers running around amok there are basically three main transformers in the whole film and it makes things far more exciting. The film has a basic premise with tons of action and good characters. It won't bring home Oscars but it's a great popcorn flick that I enjoyed.
Hailee Steinfeld has been one of my favorite actresses since True Grit and she has a way of really becoming an every-woman person that you can relate to and she plays this role very well. She's the type of hero that Shia LaBeaouf was in the original film, just a kid that went through something and you can relate to. She definitely is perfect for this type of film where the main character doesn't get a ton of depth. Jorge Lendeborg Jr. is her unlikely sidekick and romantic interest. He actually fits this role well and the two of them have good chemistry although not outstanding. John Cena is good in his supporting role as a military leader. It's a very typical role as many things about this film are but he still does a good job. What makes the film great might be it's drawback in a few ways as well. Much of the story and the characters are formulaic and without a lot of story to them. Charlie's family are all very cookie cutter but they fit the film.Travis Knight is a very interesting choice for director. This is only his second directorial film and he does it extremely well. Maybe coming from animation helped him understand the thin line between live action and animation and basing it off each other. The ""hand-to-hand"" combat between the Transformers is really quite brilliant. If you watch the cinematography of the battle scenes it's the best of a great action flick. Bumblebee takes a real beating in the movie, almost too much but I've seen that before in action flicks where the hero takes too many beatings and you wonder what makes them a hero exactly. For all it's faults and there are a few, you can still turn off your brain for two hours and enjoy a fun, action packed, popcorn flick with good humour and a fun time. 7.5/10",Bumblebee
18,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,New director Travis Knight revitalises the Transformers franchise with this impressive blockbuster,9,3 January 2019,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningOn the planet of Cybertron, a massive war wages between the heroic Autobots and the evil Decepticions, which is threatening its very existence. Optimus Prime, the leader of the Autobots, sends Bumblebee, one of the group who transforms into a Volkswagen VW, to Earth to stop a Decepticon attack there. And so, he crash lands in the year 1987, where teenage misfit Charlie (Hailee Steinfeld) is mourning the loss of her father, and struggling to fit in. While Bumblebee is chased by his Decepticon assailants, and Agent Burns (John Cena), who perceives him as a threat, he forms a bond with Charlie that can't be broken.After being so bitterly disappointed with the original 2007 live action screen adaptation of the Transformers, having been such a huge fan as a kid, I only really glanced at a couple more of them, despite the undoubtedly successful franchise it became. Heartlessly produced by Michael Bay, with no genuine affection for the TV series that was a staple of so many childhoods, no amount of success can cover over the cracks that all the original fans could spot. One of the many complaints about it was the lack of the original characters. Which made the inclusion of the ones that were, such as Bumblebee, even harder to comprehend. What was so special about this particular character that made Bay remember to include him, whilst ignoring so many others?While new director Travis Knight offers no real light on this, he has at least given the character and the franchise a refreshing makeover, displaying what could be seen as a genuine affection for the original 80s series, and infusing his film with a sassy vibe that takes you back to the time and place. He certainly gives you a hopeful little kick with the opening battle sequence, which features none other than Soundwave (!) and his cassette tape dog, making you wonder if anymore original characters will come back.While it's certainly had a little lift in quality, some of the weaknesses of Bay's franchise are still present, with some naff characters, wooden acting and clunky dialogue from some minor bit players. Steinfeld's lead performance threatens to fall prey to this in the opening segment, but as the film moves on and the material develops, her character really comes to life and gives the film a strong emotional core, as a social outcast with unprocessed grief, who can only open up to a transforming car. It's a plot with a general 80s vibe to it, on a par with a robot learning to be human, which offers echoes of Short Circuit.It has been done before, and the negative stuff does stop it from quite being great, but its done well enough to leave a real, lasting impression, which is more than can be said for anything Michael Bay knocked out. A new director has done this entry the world of good, and offers a cool, catchy recreation of the 80s, with an obligatory killer soundtrack, with everything from The Smiths to Rick Astley!, with a welcome touch of humour thrown in for good measure. Bumblebee proves to be more of a lead hero than anyone could have imagined. ****",Bumblebee
19,Pjtaylor-96-138044,'Transformers' in disguise.,7,31 December 2018,"Likeable characters, unproblematic humour, a reasonable run-time and no racial stereotypes or general leeriness mark 'Bumblebee (2018)' as an absolute miracle of a movie: a 'Transformers' film that's actually genuinely good. That's something I never thought would happen, especially considering that the franchise's latest attempt was my least favourite film of last year. How Knight managed to keep still-producer Bay at bay is beyond me but the original, innocently age-appropriate screenplay shines through like a diamond. It's brought to life with a fantastically deft hand which allows the flick's robotic battles to actually be exciting, as they should have been from the very beginning, mainly because they're consistently well-choreographed - not to mention legible - and feature actual characters, regardless of their metallic nature. We care about pretty much all of them thanks to some nicely done development, which actually dominates the screen-time. This is the most believable any of these movies have ever been, thanks to the incredibly impressive special-effects combined with the great performances and writing. For the first time, the focus isn't just on metal-on-metal combat and the film is all the better for it. It's a highly enjoyable breath of fresh air and I'd recommended it to even those who have grown tired of seeing the 'Transformers' on the big-screen, especially since this seems like a soft reboot of sorts. I actually can't wait to see what they do next. Perhaps they'll stay this course or regress to what once was. Either way, I would be happy to see an entirely Cyberton-set picture, an 80s cartoon brought vividly to life; the snippets we see here are wonderfully accurate to the television series and have a unique aesthetic I'd love to see more of, if it's given the time and attention it deserves. 7/10",Bumblebee

21,bowmanblue,"Well, the first five minutes were awesome!",5,7 May 2021,"Back in the eighties, no one looked forward to Saturday morning cartoons more than me and my friends, as we religiously tuned in to see the heroic Autobots fight the evil Decepticons in 'Transformers.' I don't know what my friends eventually thought of the way it was handled on the big screen, but, to me (besides the voice acting of Peter Cullen), it all seemed like a load of moving, spiky lumps of metal thrashing around, loosely interspersed with a teenage love story. I wasn't really a fan.However, I then heard that the next installment of the money-making franchise would be a 'spin-off' about the little yellow hero, 'Bumblebee.' After what came before I wasn't going to waste my time with this one. Yet the reviews came in and many people believed that this is what a 'Transformers' movie should be. I didn't watch it in the cinema, but I sampled it on the small screen.I was impressed. Gone were the weird and totally different character designs of the giant transforming robots. Now they looked exactly like I remembered from the eighties cartoon. Not only that, but they were battling on their home planet of Cybertron (never really explored on the big screen). I definitely think that this is what a 'Transformers' movie should be.Then it moved to Earth at about the five minutes mark. From there it went down hill (for me). Gone were the familiar metal faces and now we were back with another teenage romance and pointless human characters, all of which sidelined the true (robotic) stars at every turn.There was some action thrown in, but it was nothing special and if you enjoy car chases and robots fighting then those scenes are pretty entertaining. They were good, but too little compared to the teenagers and their families.Overall, I was really disappointed with the film. I watched the original 'Transformers' movies (parts 1-3 - I gave up after that) on DVD and ended up just skipping most scenes involving only humans, in favour of actually seeing the (true) 'stars' of the show - those who'd I've been following for around forty years. If I ever choose to watch 'Bumblebee' I'll probably skip the human scenes again. Maybe I'm just old. But then Netflix kindly released 'Transformers: War For Cybertron' and - for me - that's an example of how do to 'Tranformers' right!",Bumblebee
22,ThomasDrufke,The Heart This Series Has Been Missing,9,30 December 2018,"I'm one of those guys who actually likes the first and third Transformers films, but the other 3 are some of the worst films ever made. However, after what the last two have brought, I was admittedly done with anything related to Autobots and Decepticons. Then, the first trailer for Bumblebee comes out and I was surprisingly intrigued. Maybe that was the lack of Michael Bay's presence felt or that Travis Knight brilliantly directed Kubo a few years ago. Either way, it felt like it's own thing, and the film lived up to those hopes. It's pretty close to a replica of The Iron Giant in many ways, but its heart and charm are something that Transformers films have been missing for a long time. I'm not going to care about the big robot action if I don't first care about all the characters, and Bumblebee hits on all those accounts. Hailee Steinfeld is the best lead the series has ever had, and even John Cena had some solid moments in the midst of a well-structured action film as well. I can't believe I'm saying this, but Bumblebee is one of the best films of the year.9.0/10",Bumblebee

25,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews....,7,4 April 2019,"BumblebeeWhen aliens are choosing which earth vehicle to transform into it's best to avoid models designed by Hitler.Nevertheless, the automaton in this action movie opted to disguise itself as the people's car.As the war between Autobots and Decepticons ravages their planet, the Autobots dispatch a scout (Dylan O'Brien) to find them sanctuary. Finding Earth, the scout assumes the form of a VW Beetle and is subsequently purchased by teenager Charlie (Hailee Steinfeld). It's not until she discovers her car is an alien, that Charlie also learns that the military and Decepticons are after it.With a greater focus on characters, this prequel gives fans the original designs of the iconic 80's characters they love.

I called it that way because this movie is the closest thing to a cartoon - it is written all over it. Action scenes were pretty generic (for this series) yet pretty good, acting by our young lead was truly good and directing was by a million miles better then those we saw in last ""Transformers"" movies.Overall, while the first ""Transformers"" movie still remains my favorite, this one easily comes as number two.

27,westsideschl,Good Bot Transformations,4,7 April 2019,"Not a good first impression of the U.S. military in that their immediate response to anything different/alien is to shoot first & maybe ask questions later. Background music ranged from poor to just pointless generic period music. As for the aliens not clear where they're located in the Universe, but instant communication from Earth & near instant travel - not happening! And the perfect English that they speak - are the script writers dumbing them down for us? Written for young teen viewers so don't expect any intelligent dialogue. Usual school bullying scene involving our lead character; usual formula character stereotypes; usual young attractive female w/male as teasing addition. Usual laser with martial arts kicks fight scenes. Why does our Autobot, future VW bug transformer, have VW wheels on his back while on his home planet even before coming to Earth?

28,The-Sarkologist,Enough of the Transformers Movies,2,23 December 2018,"Honestly, if it wasn't for my brother actually wanting to see this film, I would have been hard pressed to actually get out of my seat, walk down to the cinemas, and waste two hours of my life watching this rubbish. Yeah, that is basically what this movie was, a waste of two hours, plus the half hour spent walking to the cinema and back again - that is time that I am never going to get back again.Surely, surely, surely they have beat enough out of the Transformer's bandwagon by now, so that they don't actually have to go back to the beginning and start going some prequels. Yeah, that is basically what this film is, a prequel. Honestly, the first Transformers movie was pretty good, and they pretty quickly went down hill from there, to the point that if I were to see another Transformers movie hit the screens, I'll do my best not to go and watch it, and try to remember how much of a waste of time the whole endeavour is.So, what was it that I didn't like about it - well, it was pretty much more of the same, a lot more of the same. There is really nothing in these films that differentiate them from each other. In fact, all of the ones after the first two have sort of morphed into some unimaginable blur, though I do know there was one where Chicago was smashed up, and another where Hong Kong was smashed ups, and I believe there was a third one as well which I know absolutely nothing about.Should I say any more about this film, maybe what it is about. Probably not because, honestly, I am really wasting my time here even trying to convince you not to actually watch this film. Hopefully, if I don't convince you, then there will be plenty of other reviews that pretty much say exactly the same thing as this one, though possibly shorter.",Bumblebee

31,paulclaassen,This franchise is so done for!! Yawn...,2,25 June 2019,"After that dreadful 'Transformers: The Last Knight', I was kind of hoping the franchise had come to an end. And along comes 'Bumblebee' - a prequel.The film starts looking like a video game. This completely unnecessary prequel felt like I was watching the visualization of a rushed script still in draft stages. It was cliche upon cliche with oh-so-typical American characters and offered nothing new to the franchise. The series is so done! Just like the new 'Ghostbusters', they take the female approach to the film, with Charlie replacing the Sam Witwicky character. Same old, same old...'Bumblebee' can easily be confused as a 'Transformers' spoof due the the amount of stupid moments and silly humor, which wasn't funny by the way. There are moments they wanted us to think Bumblebee was going to die, but it was ineffective, as we already know he survives since he's in all the sequels. So, there was nothing suspenseful about it. This is a prequel after all, duh!!Hailee Steinfeld did an ok job as Charlie. The rest of the cast was forgettable, really. It was hardly worth casting John Cena, as he was a very weak character who contributed nothing to the film. This was incredibly cheesy and sentimental with silly dialogue. Yawn. Please end this...Interestingly enough, this installment is the highest rated by critics, yet fared the worst at the box office. Wow, critics, that's saying a lot...(again).",Bumblebee
32,tomgillespie2002,Heart-warming nostalgia trip,7,2 April 2019,"By the time Transformers: The Last Knight rolled around in 2017, even the most hardcore fans of Michael Bay's Transformers franchise were getting tired of it all. The Last Knight, which was the fifth entry into the series, marked ten years of Bay's butt-numbing, explosion-heavy epics, which substituted the charm of the original 80's television show and toy line for faceless CGI constructs bashing each other to pieces, lame comedy, and an increasingly creepy attitude towards its female actors. Bay teased his departure from the franchise after three movies, but went on to make another two, and it's always been clear that the problem lay with the director's inability to engage the audience on an emotional level and refusal to deliver anything but headache-inducing action and softcore pornography. Eyebrows were raised when Paramount announced that one of its few memorable characters, Bumblebee, would receive his own spin-off. Yet they were significantly relaxed when they learned that Travis Knight, director of the acclaimed Kubo and the Two Strings, would helm the project, and not Bay.Opening with a battle between the Autobots and Decepticons on their home planet of Cybertron, it's immediately apparent that all this universe required was a fresh pair of eyes. Yes, this sequence isn't much more than a computer-generated smackdown between huge alien robots, but at least we can tell them apart. The Autobot leader Optimus Prime (voiced as ever by Peter Cullen) is leading a resistance against their oppressive foes, but seeing his side are losing badly, Prime sends scout B-127 (Dylan O'Brien) to Earth to set up base for their eventual rendezvous. Crashing down in 1987 California, the diminutive Autobot immediately encounters a unit of government soldiers, led by Agent Jack Burns (John Cena), on a routine training exercise, and is met with open hostility. Left grievously wounded after an attack by Decepticon Blitzwing (David Sobolov), B-127 transforms into a Volkswagen Beetle to lay low while awaiting rescue. Meanwhile, teenager and amateur mechanic Charlie Watson (Hailee Steinfeld), still grieving after the death of her father years ago, finds the rusty banger and decides to repair it as a pet project, hoping to impress junkyard owner Hank (Len Cariou) in the process. But when that final piece slips into place, Charlie finds way more in the piece of junk she names Bumblebee than she was expecting.While Bay quickly forgot about the fans who loved the cartoons, toys and comic books growing up, Knight eagerly embraces them. Rewinding the timeline back to the 1980s, Knight mixes the inevitable action set-pieces with heartfelt drama, which stems not only from Charlie's relationship with the clumsy yet adorable yellow lunk, but also from her grief and anger that her mother has already moved on. As Bumblebee stumbles around the house trying his best not to break anything, you can't help but think of E.T.: The Extra-Terrestrial. His prat-falls are made funnier because you have grown to love the character, and by evoking such an established 80's classic, Bumblebee engulfs you further in its pure nostalgia trip. Most importantly, there's a sense of fun and playfulness that was lost in the crotch-grabbing and flag-waving of Bay's cinematic haemorrhoids. Charlie and Bumblebee's bonding sessions are sweet and charming, and Steinfeld's performance is undoubtedly key to this. An endearing mix of awkward teenager and highly capable mechanic, Charlie wears vests and listens to The Smiths, and where Bay may have had her in hot pants leaning over a car, Charlie would much prefer to be underneath it. Her character helps paint an even clearer line between this semi-reboot and Bay's parasitic universe, and finally, I'm excited from the next Transformers film again.",Bumblebee

The interpretations of both Hailee Steinfeld who played as Charlie Watson and Jorge Lendeborg Jr. who played as Memo were very good. Finally, I have to say that ""Bumblebee"" is a good and beautiful movie consisted of an interesting plot which is combined with plenty of action and suspense, and very good visual effects too.

34,cruise01,Amazing Transformers film with more story and heart and some exciting action.,10,21 December 2018,"Bumblebee (5 out of 5 stars).Bumblebee is triumphant action packed film that differs from the previous five Michael Bay Transformers movies. It lives up to being one of the best and right behind the first movie that came out in 2007. What makes Bumblebee differ from the previous film? A lot can be mentioned from its origin plot how Bumblebee came to be on Earth and new characters like Charlie (Hailee Steinfeld) a teenager who is feeling a little lost after her father has passed and she feels like an outsider to her family. The plot does have a coming of age concept, some emotional connections with the characters and even Bumblebee you can feel some emotions when he transforms in front of Charlie. That is what the previous Transformers films were missing was the emotional connection. The new direction from Travis Knight also tried making this film feel like its setting 1980s with the music soundtrack, the pop culture like the bands, movies, and so on. The action sequences are a little in between in the movie. It is not a huge massive blockbuster budget like Bay's films were there is fast editing cut action throughout. Travis Knight kept his action a little more still with the camera movements, the editing. It is still big, and loud. The visual effects are still astonishing.The plot follows on Cybertron were there is a battle between the autobots and the decepticons. Optimus Prime decides to have the autobots evacuate the planet and sends Bumblebee to Earth to scout if it is a safe place for the autobots and to protect Earth from any Decepticons. Bumblebee lands on Earth. Gets discovered from the military led by Jack (John Cena). He escapes and remains hidden as a volkswagon beetle. Until, Charlie discovers him and becomes friends. Then, two decepticons land on Earth looking to track down Optimus Prime and are plotting to send a signal out to the rest of the decepticons to reach Earth.The film may have less action than the previous films. This one had more of coming of age story and emotional connections with Charlie and Bumblebee. Charlie is not your average teenage girl. She does not care about getting her hands dirty with engine oil. She doesn't have many friends. Except for her neighbor who has a crush on her. And works with her at a carnival fair in a food stand. It has a great origin story. The music soundtrack was great if you are a fan of the 1980s bands. It has enough action sequences to keep you on the edge of your seat. With Bumblebee facing against two decepticons. The visual effects are great. Hailee Steinfeld was amazing with her performance. John Cena was good too. Jorge Lendeborg Jr was good playing Charlie's neighbor and crush.Overall, Bumblebee is a great film. The action and visual effects are awesome. The story is what matters as it built emotional depth with Bumblebee and Charlie. This film sticks out from the rest of the movies for the better.",Bumblebee
35,Floated2,Best Transformers film,8,2 October 2019,"Bumblebee lived up to its highly hype and has delivered upon its expectations.

36,eddie_baggins,An enjoyable family-orientated Transformers,6,20 December 2018,"Put your hand up if you thought Bumblebee was going to be one of the year's worst and most unnecessary films.I know I for one held very little hope for this new take on the Transformers universe, focussing on everyone's favourite yellow robot in disguise, but low and behold Bumblebee ends up being a fun-filled family oriented blockbuster ride, that is perfectly entertaining for new or old fans alike.With more in common with Iron Giant than Michael Bay's previous carnage filled Transformers movies (some of which are unduly ridiculed for something they're not trying to be), first time live action director Travis Knight instils his 80's infused friendship tale of lonely 18 year old Charlie Watson and her newly discovered robot friend/VW beetle, with a sense of fun and playfulness that rollicks along at a fast pace as it ticks off all the narrative beats you would expect from such a story.This is arguably the biggest problem with Knight's film, it plays everything so straight down the line that there's very little to be surprised or excited about story wise, with everything playing out exactly as you would expect it to do.Bumblebee isn't the type of Hollywood event film that you expect to mess with the playbook, but there's carefully little visual pizazz or filmmaking inventiveness on display here and for all his flaws as a filmmaker, this is where Bay found himself shining at stages with his Transformer's films, with most entries displaying at least a few key sequences that showed off his ability to do spectacle.The robot v robot action here feels rather so-so in comparison, no set-piece here doing anything of note to make you remember it once the credits start to roll.Where Knight and his film excel against Bay's explosion heavy counterparts is in the heart department, with Hailee Steinfeld and her friendship with the Dylan O'Brien voiced Bumblebee giving the film a solid rock to jump off.It was always hard to care much for any characters in the previous Transformer film entries but here Knight and his team have made a no doubt rather generic angry/lost teenager story into something immediately likeable, making Bumblebee feel more human and relatable than any Transformers film yet, all the while keeping things nice and simple, meaning younger audiences are going to lap this film up just as much as long-term fans, with the expectation being you can expect to see a lot more Bumblebee merchandise in X-mas stockings around the world.Final Say -It never threatens to break new ground and plays things a little to safe but Bumblebee is still a fun and well-made blockbuster that alongside its killer 80's soundtrack and a sense of playfulness, makes it the best Transformers film since the original.3 boxes of Mr. T cereal out of 5",Bumblebee

38,leonblackwood,"Great CGI, poor concept! 4/10",4,15 May 2019,"Review:
This is yet another average movie from the Transformers franchise, which certainly looked good, in terms of the CGI, but the storyline and poor characters, really let the movie down. It starts off well, with the war on planet Cybertron, were the Autobot resistance, led by Optimus Prime, is on the verge of losing the civil war against the Decepticons but once it switches to planet earth, it goes from bad to worse. It's set in 1987, and the director portrayed the period well, but it's really the weak characters, and poor wit, that really didn't work. Bumblebee made the movie watchable, but the miserable Charlie Watson (Hailee Steinfeld) got on my nerves after a while. I can understand why she had to play the part in that manner because she is traumatised by the death of her father, and she's resentful of her mother for moving on too quickly with her new boyfriend, but we have seen Bumblebee teamed up with a character like this before. After finding the Volkswagen Beetle in a scrapyard, her life changes, and she becomes more upbeat, but once the Decepticons track Bumblebee on earth, the movie becomes extremely far-fetched and totally ridiculous in places. A lot of the previous Transformer movies had messy action scenes, which were hard to notice the attention to detail, but this movie had clean and clear shots which looked good on the big screen. The transformations were brilliant, especially when the Decepticons were switching from planes, cars and Transformers, but it wasn't enough to make the movie a unique cinematic experience. The relationship between Charlie and Bumblebee was quite emotional in parts, especially when they had to part company towards the end, but her ridiculous family who didn't really seem that bothered when their house was totally destroyed by Bumblebee, was a pointless addition to the cast. It did follow the usual Transformers concept because the same thing happened in the very first movie, starring Shia LaBeouf, were his family were also a nuisance, so it wasn't that surprising. Anyway, I'm surprised that the movie got a PG rating because some of the action scenes are pretty gruesome, especially when the Decepticons are executing there enemies. As for the other characters in the film, I didn't really see the point of Memo (Jorge Lendeborg Jr.), who seemed like a blithering idiot throughout the film, and Agent Burns (John Cena) didn't act like he was taking the whole ""Decepticons destroying earth"" seriously. Bumblebee looked tiny compared to the other Transformers, but he always stood his ground, even though he got beaten to his very last screw most of the time. With the 3 storylines running together at the same time, which are Charlie's dysfunctional family, Charlie's relationship with Bumblebee, and Bumblebee vs. The Decepticons, the movie seems a bit of a mess but it all comes together with a final showdown, which was pretty intense. I didn't have high expectations for the film, after the disappointing last couple of Transformers movies, so I wasn't totally disappointed. I do think that it's time for a darker and more adult version of the Transformer movies because this ""teenage sidekick"" concept, has been done to death. Watchable!Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Travis Knight, who also brought you, the spectacular Kubo and the Two Strings. He was the lead animator for Coraline, ParaNorman and the Boxtrolls, which he also produced, so his background has mostly been in animation, hence why the attention to detail in this movie was so good. Although Kubo and the Two Strings didn't smash the box office, it was a great movie and a fantastic achievement for his first major release. This movie made a hefty profit, but that's not to say that it's a better film. Visually it's brilliant, but it failed when it comes to bringing something new to the Transformer legacy.

41,southdavid,Bay can buzz off !,7,8 January 2019,"An inspiring trailer that reignited some interest in a franchise I was done with, isn't quite matched by a solid prequel that ticks the boxes that the series should have been doing since the beginning.Escaping from a falling Cybertron, Bumblebee is sent to earth to try and establish a new base for Autobot operation. He conceals himself from the Decepticons hunting him by hiding as a VW Beetle, eventually encountering Charlie (Hailee Steinfield) an 18 year old girl struggling with the death of her father. As Charlie fixes her new car, she discovers his secret and decades before the rest of the world, is drawn into the Transformers war.There are a number of improvements over the Michael Bay directed films, not that they could get much worse. Some of the progressions are very obvious stuff, such as changing the characters so they actually resembled their appearances from the cartoon. The burst of nostalgia from that (and in particular the scene where Soundwave appears) was, frankly, enough on its own to get my ticket money. Another obvious way to differentiate itself from the Bay films was to drastically cut back from the nonsense, continent hopping, story - filled with so many identical looking robots it's impossible to tell who's who. Instead, the action never leaves the small Bay Area town that Charlie lives in, and there are only really three Transformers that properly feature in the story (There are more on Cybertron in the opening scenes, but they are don't feature beyond that preamble). It's a tighter, smaller scale story, where the motivations of all the characters are logical and the consequences make sense. The fight scenes are much better too, again, improved by the simple act of being able to tell the characters apart. The 80's setting is great, in particular the use of music is ace.It's not without criticism though. It takes a while to get going, and there are a few too many scenes about Charlie's loss than are really required to get it over to the audience. It is, as others have said, a fairly familiar story and some of the foreshadowing is pretty heavy handed (no spoilers but, the fact she's a competitive diver is really crowbarred in there, even though the payoff it's not actually that necessary for the finale.)I'm not sure where we go from here with the series from here. I'd like to see another film from Travis Knight but whether that's another prequel, or the next film in the main series is debateable.",Bumblebee

43,paul-allaer,"Great ""ET-meets-Herbie"" refresh for the Transformers franchise",7,2 January 2019,"""Bumblebee"" (2018 release; 114 min.) opens with a bang: we are dropped on ""Cybertron"" in the middle of a ferocious battle between the Decepticons and the Autobots, who are on the verge of losing. Out of desperation, Optimus Prime sends B-127 away to earth to build a new operation. We then go to ""1987, Earth"", where B-127 causes mayhem upon landing smack in the middle of a US Special Forces field exercise. And then 2 Decepticons appear out of the blue. Badly wounded, B-127 winds up in a medal scarp yard, where one day Charlie, a young lady on the verge of her 18th birthday, stumbles upon a yellow VW beetle (B-127)... At this point we are 10 min. into the movie but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.Couple of comments: this is the first live action movie directed by Travis Knight, who recently brought us the excellent ""Kubo and the Two Strings"". Here he takes on a gigantic task, namely steering the latest Transformer franchise movie into the right direction. The story is a prequel to the 2007 movie, and works quite nicely. I kept thinking that this is at is core the very same story as ""ET The Extra-Terrestrial"", YES! The charm of the movie lies in the initial awkward interaction between Charlie and B-127 (whom she names ""Bumblebee""), only to see that awkwardness blossom into an outright friendship, as unlikely as that sounds. Because B-127 goes around as a VW beetle and there are quite a few car chases, the other obvious comparison is the ""Herbie"" movie franchise. Hailee Steinfeld is cast well as Charlie, as she brings the perfect mix of bewilderment and determination. Given that the movie is set in 1987, we get a big dose of late 80s nostalgia (Alf is a TV hit!, people drink TAB, etc.), including also with the music. I almost fell out of my chair when in Charlie's first scene (as she is getting up), the Smiths' ""Bigmouth Strikes Again"" thunders on the big screen (they later also bring ""Girlfriend In A Coma""). Other featured artists include Duran Duran, Howard Jones, Steve Winwood, and Tears for Fear, just to name those. The last half hour of the movie is predictably heavy on the fight scenes between Bumblebee and the Decepticons, but all in all, this is a Transformer movie with a lighter ""ET-meets-Herbie"" touch that feels like a breath of fresh air in the Transformers franchise.""Bumblebee"" opened wide just before Christmas, and has generated a huge amount of acclaim, both critical and commercial. Frankly, that is the reason that I was convinced this was worth checking out (I've not watched the previous 2 Transformer movies as the franchise felt stuck, if not stale). The New Year's Day screening where I saw this at in a huge theater was attended very nicely, and this bodes well for the weeks to come. If you were once charmed by the Transformers franchise but have been sitting it out recently, by all means, give ""Bumblebee"" a chance, be it in the theater, on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray. Chances are that you will be pleased you did...",Bumblebee
44,stevendbeard,Robot On Robot Action,8,17 December 2018,"I saw ""Bumblebee"", starring Hailee Steinfeld-The Pitch Perfect movies, 3 Days to Kill; John Cena-Blockers, The Marine; Jorge Lendeborg Jr-Love,Simon, Spider_Man:Homecoming and Len Cariou-Blue Bloods_tv, Death Wish_2018. It also has the voices of Angela Bassett as Shatter & Justin Theroux as Dropkick-both are bad guys.
This is a spin_off of the Transformer movies. It is also a prequel to them-it takes place in 1987-and Michael Bay does not direct it. He is a producer, though. The movie starts with a big battle between the Transformers and the Decepticons on the planet Cybertron. The Transformers are losing. Bumblebee is sent by Optimus Prime to guard the Earth until the Transformers can gather their forces enough to kick the Decepticons' derrieres. Bumblebee lands in California, where he has a run in with John-a military man-and befriends Hailee. Hailee has her own problems; her dad recently died, she has lost interest in her family & friends-probably because of the dad dying part-and she is turning 18. Jorge is the guy next door that has a crush on Hailee but she barely knows he exists. Len plays Hailee's uncle that has a garage/junk shop that Hailee procures items she needs-she likes to work on cars, which might come in handy if she ever needs to work on, oh, I don't know, maybe a robot? There are lots of robot on robot action-that is the main reason for these movies of course-and you do learn how Bumblebee gets his name.
It's rated ""PG-13"" for sci_fi action and violence and has a running time of 1 hour & 53 minutes.
I enjoyed it and would buy it on DVD.",Bumblebee

The best Anthropomorphism I've seen since WALL-E. With Hailee Steinfeld impressively leading the action blockbuster, this new telling of an old tale is a refreshing change. Director, Travis Knight nailed period of 1987 that was effective stirring up the nostalgic memories . Bumblebee proves it's possible to bring fun and a sense of wonder back to a bloated blockbuster franchise.",Bumblebee
47,CubsandCulture,Why did it take so long to make a solid movie in this franchise ti?,8,15 June 2019,"Bay's transformers films are *awful.* The second one especially is like Bay id's vomited all over the screen. I didn't even bother watching films 4 and 5 given how bad everything was. Unfortunately, Bumblebee is suffers from the decisions that the franchise made up to this point. The design of the robots is still way too busy. The film's ending feels inorganic to make sure the film fits into continuity. Likewise, the violence in the film is still too graphic for this concept. (pro tip: the robots are alive!). It was especially off putting in for how Bumblebee lost his voice. The Bay films are so bad they still manage to tarnish this one.But apart from that this film is just great. The story is character driven and there is plenty of character beats. The humor feels organic to the characters and situation. (The gags work too!) The film has just enough stakes and grandeur to feel big enough for an sci-fi adventure film. The fights are visually understandable. Best of all the characters are likable and human. So really to make a good film you need a straightforward plot, with engaging characters.This plays like a mixture of the Iron Giant , ET and the best parts of the Transformers franchise. This should have been the first film in the franchise!",Bumblebee

Optimus Prime dispatches Bumblebee to planet Earth to escape a war on Cybertron. Prime will arrive later. This fact is to be kept a secret from the Decepticons as if they find out they'll be able to ambush the Autobots when they arrive on Earth. It is up to Bumblebee to manage by himself on Earth until Prime arrives. This was more a coming of age movie for the female protagonist with her high school dramas between friends and family. Only a couple Transformer battle scenes and lots of Bumblebee acting spooked around humans yet tough in battle. Nothing special in this installment.",Bumblebee

50,Fluke_Skywalker,Is less more? Kinda.,6,19 March 2019,"Plot; An advanced scout from a noble faction on Cybertron, a planet inhabited by robotic beings able to transform into vehicles, comes to Earth w/his enemies hot on his trail.Over the last decade director Michael Bay delivered five live-action Transformers films, each more bloated and incomprehensible than the last. By The Last Knight the series had, ironically, transformed from being like your fun Uncle Jim who came over every Christmas and entertained everyone w/his wild stories to your creepy Uncle Jim who came over every Christmas and went on wild tangents for hours while you just stared at the clock and prayed for the whole thing to be over. Bumblebee represents a hard reboot, not just in story, but in style as well. It's a welcome change, even if the results are mixed.Clocking in well under 2 hrs., it's far more lean than Bay's offerings, and this is both an asset and a hinderance. Bay's philosophy was ""More is more, and more more is MORE, so here's some more!"". He tried to beat fun into you, and the result was often (for me anyway) the complete opposite. Here, while the action lacks the style and skill of Bay's balletic chaos, it at least knows restraint can be a virtue. That's something, I guess. The story is wafer thin. Sure the ""plots"" of Bay's movies became increasingly head-scratching, but at least they aspired to something grand. The goal here seems to be K.I.S.S., or Keep It Simple Stupid. Mission accomplished. It's car meets girl. A ""What if a John Hughes wannabe had made a Transformers film in the 80s?"". It's a solid enough hook, and the stuff between car and girl works thanks in no small part to a really charming performance from Hailee Steinfeld, but anytime the thinly drawn baddies show up, they feel like a third wheel. The Cousin from Indiana your Mom insists you take w/you on your date w/the hot -fill in the blank- next door.I enjoyed Bumblebee, which is more than I can say for the last few Bayformers movies (I actually have yet to watch The Last Knight), but I'd have loved it had they been able to marry the charming coming of age teen stuff w/what should be the meal to its desert. Primarily the battle between good and evil transforming robots.",Bumblebee
51,pixrox1,I remember that when I played with the Tranformers . . .,9,4 January 2019,". . . BUMBLEBEE always was my favorite. Even though he lacked wings, you could sail him in and out of the frizzy dandelions going to seed while humming ""Flight of the BUMBLEBEE."" While my little brothers were out ""nuking"" ant hills to the tune of ""Ride of the Valkyries,"" and yakking about how much they enjoyed the smell of Napalm in the Morning (as if they were going directly into the Heart of Darkness as soon as they guzzled their breakfast Tang), my goal was to steer clear of ""The Horror"" and just be able to swirl BUMBLEBEE around some more. Thankfully, the movie BUMBLEBEE is even more of a distraction than the toy BUMBLEBEE. That's a good thing, since diversions are much more necessary Now than they were Back Then. Before, our Presidents would demand that dictators TEAR DOWN their walls. Now, our Dictators are raving about throwing up gargantuan barricades throughout our natural wildernesses and historic districts. When they used to talk about the Pharaoh forcing folks to push around giant rock blocks in Sunday School, it was hard to believe that anyone could be so mean without being struck dead by lightning. At least two dudes actually DO get liquefied during BUMBLEBEE. Combining these happenings with all the things that plagued the Ancient Egyptians back in the day, it would seem that prudent people should give America's so-called POTUS a VERY wide berth if and when he comes calling at an arena near you.",Bumblebee

The movie is focused on the life of a teenager whose father has died and she hates her stepdad because of no reason. She is a dedicated hardworking girl who is being bullied by some rich girls why again no reason. Her neighbourhood boy likes and her but she doesn't have any feelings for him. Suddenly a car enters into her life which is not a car but a transformer and her life changes drastically phew.The acting by the leading lady Hailee Steinfeld is very pathetic and she has same face expressions throughout the movie whether she is angry, sad or happy. John cena was just ok Jorge Lendeborg Jr. was good.Plot as I mentioned earlier is very predictable and the movie is boring. Action is very limited and is just ok.There are few scenes which was beyond my understanding. How did the girl helped bumblebee by diving into underwater. The background music is also too loud and jokes are bad.With pathetic jokes, boring screenplay, predictable plot and limited action this movie is just one time watch.

54,lukem-52760,THE BEST TRANSFORMERS MOVIE SINCE THE 1986 ANIMATED CLASSIC!!!,8,6 August 2019,"FINALLY we have a fantastic & True Transformers movie, it's taken years & years to get here!!!
Michael Baye's Transformers films are Terrible, big explosions & city destroying & way, way over-long but here he's only a producer.Bumblebee gives us Transformers that look just like they did way back in the 80's just like the characters we grew up loving!!!
I loved them & had all the Action figures & was obsessed with the classic 1986 animated movie, so yeah I'm a fan & grew up in that era as i did wirh my other loves (Ghostbusters & TMNT franchises) but i never liked the other Transformers films as they didn't look like my heroes & the films were over long to the point of very boring & the city destroying & explosions got very boring too!!!!Anyway Bumblebee is a beautify made sci-fi adventure that's full of heart & with fantastic characters we care about, especially Charlie played amazingly by Hailee Steinfeld she gives a fantastic & emotional performance as an 18 year old troubled girl who has lossed her dad & has lossed herself until she meets Bumblebee & that's the big Heart of the story, they bond beautifully & become friends.
Hailee gives such a lovely, lonely & emotional performance as Charlie that she completely becomes that damaged lost girl & so her friendship with Bumblebee is so sweet & heartwarming.There's a lovely warm Spielberg atmosphere to this movie & he was a producer too so it mirrors that old school 80's kids meet creatures tone & feel & being set in 1987 adds all that lovely Nostalgia.Bumblebee is the best Transformers movie since that '86 classic.
The added nostalgic burst to me was seeing & hearing Optimus Prime & oh my he looked just like the original animated version i grew up loving & with the same iconic heroic voice, it was BEAUTIFUL!!!
Bumblebee should be an instant CLASSIC that's for the whole family to enjoy & with a lovely story of friendship & a big beating heart throughout this lovely adventure.
Heartwarming & special.",Bumblebee
55,alansabljakovic-39044,Dissapointed and less than meh,5,30 December 2018,"I found this very cheesy and extremely stupid. The dialogue is super stupid and most of the moments are very predictable. I'm not impressed with it and I don't think this is better than Bay movies. This is on level Transformers 4 and I don't know why would you cast John Cena in any movie you want to be good.Btw Bumblebee throws cd on which is playing Never gonna give you up! Like for real how can you do that?? She wears Motorhead shirt and doesn't even listen metal music (poser).Action scenes are fine with me except when they are not. I mean, rocket hits the can and can just rolls without any damage like nothing happend. They put 10 C4 bombs on plastic door that could easily be broken with fist and even better there is a line where John Cena says ""There is a door in my way."" and bombs it.
Post end credits scene is very wrong and doesn't fit in original story. I just gotta say I expected more.",Bumblebee
56,questl-18592,Bumble,6,2 November 2019,"In terms of Transformers movies, Bumblebee has more than likely rocketed to the top. That's not necessarily the most impressive thing given how awful the others are, with the exception of the first one, though there is definitely some heavy nostalgia bias there.Focusing on just the relationship between Bumblebee and Steinfeld rather than throwing in a dozen indistinguishable allows the movie to be clearer both visually and in regards to the plot. There was also a noticeable lack of crude and racist humor, no onslaught of American flags. It didn't even explode as much as the other Transformers.The restraint is greatly appreciated but that doesn't instantly make it a masterpiece. It's still a big transforming robot movie.

The Extra Terrestrial.In itself it's not actually too bad, but the story is very simplified and child orientated.The soundtrack is fantastic and most of the cast do a good job. I could definitely have lived without John Cena though, who was just so awful I couldn't even look at him. Just why???As a set up for the Shia Leboeuf films that follow chronologically it's quite good, but it probably would have just been better to do a proper prequel that showed why the Autobots had to flee to Earth and how, as there wasn't really a lot of substance to this.The geeky romance thing was cute, but another way to bring the classification down to a PG. If you're going to make it cannon, don't make it so different from the rest. You wouldn't make the 'Hobbit' for kids having got the adults on your side for 'The Lord Of The Rings'.It could have easily been a cartoon film that was nothing to do with the others in the series and then it might not have seemed like a vamped up 'Herbie' film.",Bumblebee

There are plenty like me who are very casual watchers of this series. To elaborate on that I remember thinking the first one was pretty good. The second one, if memory serves me, I thought was a mess and that one with Mark Wahlberg was decent. Bumblebee, however, hits its own sweet spot. The main character Charle is very charismatic, an humble type with an inner pain she carries to which the circumstances work well with. The story, while predictable, serves the movie and is fleshed out in a very enjoyable way. Bumblebee himself is a great Transformer: lovable and bad@$$. With the huge extra character of the soundtrack from the 80's this is a big win woven with some pretty wicked humor. I'm well past the age this movie is aimed at and I really recommend it to all. Excellent escapist entertainment in the league of the best Saturday matinees and resurrects the Transformer franchise as this is undoubtedly the best of the lot.",Bumblebee
60,a_chinn,"Think E.T. or Old Yeller, except with an adorable giant robot",6,26 April 2020,"I loath the Transformer films, with their bombastic and uncreative Rock 'Em Sock 'Em Robot battles, but this entry into the series is more about characters and relationships than it is explosions and chases. Oh sure, ""Bumblebee"" has explosions and chase scenes, but they're almost ancillary to the main story of troubled teen Charlie, a charming Hailee Steinfeld, fixing up a yellow junkyard VW Bug that ends up being the titular Transformer and the close bond that forms between the two. Following the classic a-boy-and-his-dog formula, Steinfeld teaches Bumblebee tricks, take care of him durning sickness, and forms a close bond, all of which leads to a sad farewell at the film's finale. Steven Spielberg served as the film's executive producer and is reportedly responsible for the film's story concept, which owes more than a little to ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial."" It's when the film dips into plot lines involving Decepticons and government agent John Cena trying to locate Bumblebee that ""Bumblebee"" loses steam and slips into the dull bombast of the Michael Bay Transformer films. Much more interesting are storylines about Steinfeld working at Hot Dog on a Stick at the pier and her budding relationship a nerdy fellow pier vendor, Jorge Lendeborg Jr. or her having to deal with mean girls from school or the backstory of Steinfeld coming to grips with her mom, an excellent Pamela Adlon from the brilliant FX series ""Better Things,"" remarrying after her father's death. As much as Steinfeld helps Bumblebee, Bumblebee helps Steinfeld navigate her teen troubles, and the bond between the two is the heart of the film, which makes the routine action sequences far more interesting. The throwback 1980s setting is also fun and gives the filmmakers the perfect excuse to litter the film with an excellent 80s soundtrack. Overall, the Transformer action is pretty ho-hum and routine, but Steinfeld is terrific and her bonding with her pet robot is pretty irresistible.",Bumblebee

There's plenty of nostalgia and it's great to see the G1 designs (the opening on Cybertron is incredible). Hailee Steinfeld is incredible, especially in the more emotional scenes. John Cena and Jorge Lendeborg Jr. are both great. The new triple changers are excellent and the voice acting by Angela Bassett and Justin Theroux is great.

64,rgkarim,BumbleBee Did Not Stumble For Me! Steps in the right direction,8,21 December 2018,"Hollywood touches everything it can, finding topics that can potentially be turned into a new movie franchises until every inch of profit is squeezed out. A toy series turned cartoon, that soon became a live action motion picture series that at one time blew our minds and soon blew our wallets. After many hardships, the series was about to crash and burn, until the Bay era was handed over to a new team to try and bring it back to life. Tonight, the full world release is upon us and given the trailers, can this film succeed where the others have failed? That's where my review comes in, so here we go as I review:Movie: Bumblebee (2018)Director:
Travis Knight
Writers:
Christina Hodson (screenplay by), Christina Hodson(story by)
Stars:
Hailee Steinfeld, Dylan O'Brien, Megyn Price
LIKES:Character Development: Bumblebee starts off on the right foot by bringing some character development the film sorely needed. The titular characters get a gross dive into the psyche, finding new ways to expand the quiet hero's role outside of new weapons to shoot. In addition, Steinfeld's character is much more realistic than the mess we had in the other five installments. Her history, her outlook on life, and social dynamics are covered extraordinarily well, making sure to connect the points and actually give some growth. The relationship between the robot and girl is heartwarming and an appealing dynamic to invest your time into.The Story: The movie succeeds again where the others had trouble. While not the most in depth, this prequel, and potential reboot, does make a much more connected plot that wasn't too cheesy or stuffed in comic craziness. It bridges the Cybertron to Earth transition well, while setting up the plot for potential sequels, while also standing on its own with the previously mentioned character development. Dropping the convoluted tangled subplots opened the movie to more fun in both comedy and action. Speaking of which.Comedy: Ever since number one Transformers has had a special spot for overdone comedy antics and ridiculous levels of meme worthy gags. Noticing the declining trend in quality of the jokes, Bumblebee's writers did a fantastic job of integrating some fresh laughs into the mix without going too far into the stale territory. The 80s nostalgic references and pop culture power with Bee is sensational and by avoiding the tacky toilet humor, it doesn't lose its stride. Even more impressive is how the comedy flows into the story, working with it and not trying to overtake it as has been seen in the past. A few tangential scenes did occur mind you, but limited their time limit to get back on track in the short time limit.Pacing: The last two films proved that the writing struggled to fill the nearly 3 hour run times with engaging material, leading to a sluggish rambling with little value. Bumblebee shines here as well, not only by shortening the run time by nearly an hour, but also with a pace that kept moving and in time with the other antics. As such, don't expect too much boredom in this installment.The Action: Hands down the aspect I was watching for the most, Bumblebee again manages to achieve the goal of improving upon the action that it sold for so long. The yellow bug had much more epic and fluid moves, with improve choreography and some dynamic sequences that were captured beautifully and not lost too sketchy camera work. Throw in the fact that the special effects weren't too overdone, nor the focus of the film, and it led to cleaner action moments that hooked me into the get go. By not forcing the action too much, I think it made the moments shine a little brighter, and kept the theater quality up.The Soundtrack: When it comes to the 80s, you know the music was legendary in its synthesizers and emotional rantings. Well, Bumblebee seems to have a good ear for some legendary tracks and while comically integrated well, the selection was just wonderful to listen too throughout the film. Be ready to tap your toes to the beats my friend, or at least get set for lip syncing.DISLIKES:More Action: A small dislike, but an action junkie like me wanted more of the epic display of battling between robotic factions. Cybertron was a great introduction, but why could we not get more of it throughout the film. Perhaps another prequel about the war for Cybertron will be in the future, but a little more of the fighting on Earth could have helped relieve this want.Attention To Detail: Again, a small dislike, but Bumblebee's writers may have missed some of the story elements from the previous film. The way this is set up suggests that this film will be reboot of the series, a good thing in terms of story. Yet if it is going to continue on and serve as the first film in the Michael Bay Series, then it loses points for trying to ignore the details they once cherished.John Cena: His character isn't bad, and his acting fits the character, but I was disappointed with the way to took the character given the previous history of human agents. Cena's character goes through the usual ringers, but misses the target in terms of being a little too silly, not getting the full integrative procedures, and not having the same bite that others have had. As such, I kind of felt it was a wasted character for me, and could have been an added character bonus and story plot for whatever the plans for this series are. Not utilizing this actor to the mix... was a wasted opportunity.The Decepticons: The antagonist robots have got some more flare and sass than a few of the other portrayals, but something that still blows my mind is that the studio struggles to maximize on some of the heavy hitters the show once had . Don't get me wrong, the two in this film were still deadly rivals for Bee to fight, but they just lacked depth, and investment again when once more they had the potential to start out on the right foot. Perhaps if there had been more Cybertron, or they had chosen a historical legend to be the main head this would have helped this area, but for now the record of still choosing some nameless borgs rings true ad they need to get a better handle for the next movie.
The VERDICT:Okay, the cinematic Transformers is still not perfect, but this movie is definitely a fun installment that greatly improved on the weaknesses the original 5 were holding. With greater character development, a wonderful relationship investment, comedy that worked with the story, and action that was miles better given they used better camera work and coordination, this series could finally get the upgrade it needed. However, the film still needs to find some investment into the other characters for me, and choose the route it wants to take from here as either reboot (my preferred option) or continuation, as this will help make up for a few details and choices that didn't quite work for me. One thing for certain though is this: the balance of story, character development, and action was miles above the Bay quintology, and proves that special effects is not the answer to Transformers. Definitely worth a trip to theater for the special effects though. My scores are:Action/Adventure/Sci-Fi: 8.0-8.5
Movie Overall: 7.0-7.5",Bumblebee
65,justin-fencsak,Not since the 1986 movie has a Transformers movie gotten it right,10,30 December 2018,"When Michael Bay directed the first Transformers movie way back in 2007, it became a surprise hit at the box office during a year when Spider-Man dominated that year before reboots killed the webslinger. Then came Revenge of the Fallen, which made lots of money yet fans were divided over the action and length of the movie. Dark of the Moon then arrived and things turned a bit sour, with Age of Extinction becoming the longest robot movie yet made lots of cash before The Last Knight put the franchise on life support. Then came Bumblebee, which is one of the best movies of the year and the best Transformers movie ever since the 1986 movie. Halee Stenfeld plays a young teenage on the verge of graudating from high school and dealing with her dad's death when suddenly Bumblebee arrives to Earth after fighting with other robots on Cyberton in 1987. Ensue bonding between female human and robot, who loses his voice when one of the bad robots slits his throat and loses his memory. By watching 80s movies and hanging out with the woman's friends, Bumblebee becomes a friendly robot that also can turn into a beetle. The best part of the film has to be the last part when Bumblebee fights against John Cena and his group of evil robots. In the end, the hero wins and the setting for the first live action transformers movie begins. I saw it in 3d, which is pretty good. It's also the second shortest transformers movie ever, and worth the ticket price. Highly Recommended.",Bumblebee

The film was actually pretty good far better than the transformers films previous (last 3).The film was more grounded for one, the story-line was simple & consistent as with the scenes which didn't drag or play out too long.The action & scenes involving Bumblebee & Charlie were spread well & you actually could follow this film a lot more than the previous films which were badly filmed, badly plotted, badly edited, badly directed... I could go on, but yes, this film had heart & had a simple story you could follow!You basically knew what was what & there wasn't too many jumps from scenes with millions of details thrown into your face!I even found this film to be more light hearted & more engaging with the characters being more developed, you actually felt for them! Not to mention the film wasn't a confusing a mess with multiple story-lines thrown in & getting tangled into one another! It was simple!A last thing to note, is that the film was under 2 hours in length! I misread the run time & thought it was longer, but found this film to be pretty short in comparison to the previous film which well over 2 hours unnecessarily! Hell, even the end climax was done & dusted fairly quickly & not dragged out for longer than needed! The film was 1 hour & 49 minutes long! This is how films should be! Not too long, not dragged out & kept to an appropriate length!I'm not much of a fan of the Transformers films, but this one was pretty decent! I actually liked this one! I overheard some people saying they hated this film! Don't get what their problems were because this film was actually good in comparison to the others which were way too long & boring!

This was the first of the franchise to not objectify the female cast and, indeed, cast women in primary roles (as well as hiring a woman to pen the screenplay). Hailee Steinfeld was perfect in her grounded role and the emphasis on her relationship with Bumblebee (who was well drawn as young and naive in his new environment) and her own personal journey to find herself after a great loss was a good match with the action adventure origin story. I give this film a 7.9 (best yet) out of 10. {SciFi Action Adventure}",Bumblebee
69,arungeorge13,Bumblebee: What Works & What Doesn't! [+57%],6,24 March 2019,"What Works:1. The titular character of Bumblebee gets a story to himself and it's a cliched-yet-entertaining one!2. The equation between Charlie (a remarkable Hailee Steinfeld) and Bumblebee is heartwarming and built up decently. The scenes where they bond over 80's music are particularly nice.3. The Michael Bay-isms (explosions every five seconds, sexualization of women characters, messy set-pieces) are largely absent.4. The humor bits are, thankfully, well-written and absolutely clean. There's a decent balance struck between action and emotion.5. Travis Knight's ('Kubo and the Two Strings') direction certainly elevates the sometimes-amateurish screenplay by Christina Hodson.What Doesn't:1. The screenplay offers very little surprises. If you're a typical movie-watching adult, there won't be much in 'Bumblebee' that's difficult to predict.2. John Cena's character (Agent Burns) unfortunately doesn't stand out. Other than a fairly interesting opening sequence, most of his scenes lack good writing.3. 'Bumblebee' appears to be written/made keeping in mind the viewing interests of adolescents/teens than fans of the original franchise. The notions of friendship, team-building, and coming-of-age are key aspects tackled in the film. Hence, there's a good chance that it won't go down too well with the larger section of film-goers (i.e. adults).4. The plotting is a little uneven throughout. Obviously, the 'E.T' vibes are hard to get rid of.",Bumblebee
70,Abdulxoxo,One of the better films in the Transformer franchise,7,25 December 2020,"Bumblebee is surprisingly fantastic, it had better written humor and characters. it's a transformer movie but with heart and soul. The action sequences are excellent and had far less unnecessary explosions and better editing as you can see everything clearly. The characters are well drawn and have personality. Bumblebee is such a lovable character in this one and his dynamic duo with Charlie is just perfect. The performances are very good; Hailee Steinfeld is well-casted, and she easily carries the film. The visual effects are stunning, and the soundtrack is amazing; it has a lots of classic 80s songs that fits well with the themes presented in the movie.
Overall, Bumblebee is one of the better films in the transformer franchise, it's well-written and has rich characters, and also very entertaining.",Bumblebee
71,Troy_Campbell,Doesn't revitalise the franchise as much as it could have.,5,26 December 2018,"Going back to the 80s to tell the story of when Bumblebee first arrived on Earth, this prequel attempts to revamp the Transformers franchise with more heart, a narrower focus and less explosions. Replacing Michael Bay at the helm, Travis Knight is in charge of finding a balance between delivering what fans love about the series (i.e. total Bayhem) whilst offering enough of a fresh take to entice back those who gave up on the franchise a few sequels ago. He partially succeeds. Anchoring the story is Hailee Steinfeld's Charlie, an 18 year old who is struggling with life, love and the loss of her father. It's an engaging turn from Steinfeld, and one that imbues this prequel with a poignancy not even attempted in the previous instalments. The titular robotic hero is, of course, fun to hang out with; Bee's childish antics, agile fighting style and steadfast loyalty continuing his status as a fan favourite. Although his real superpower seems to be silently transforming when an unsuspecting mum is about to see him in 'person' mode. Proving that blockbusters are not easy to get right, Knight fails to capitalise on the core emotional connection with a string of underwhelming set pieces that, despite being mercifully shorter, still rely on the same choppy editing and chaotic cinematography that has consistently cursed these movies. Even more frustrating is the casting of John Cena as a vengeful soldier who brings new meaning to the term 'meathead'. His cigar chomping baddie is straight from a vintage Arnie flick; yet rather than being hilariously ironic, it's flat out terrible. The 80s setting (and soundtrack) offers a welcome change of tone and the desire to produce a more character-driven entry is admirable, but Bumblebee falls short of its aim to revitalise the franchise thanks to a few large missteps.",Bumblebee
72,Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,Just what it needed: no Michael Bay directing.,9,1 January 2019,"Bumblebee comes as a shocking surprise to me because up until now, ALL the Transformers movies since 2007 have given me migraines due to all the nauseating CGI (specifically the CG-robot mouths imitating human lips *ech*) that didn't know when to moderate action with character, or drama with spectacle (not drama OR spectacle). Bumblebee addresses all of those problems and then some in Travis Knight's live-action directorial debut: his second feature since Kubo and the Two Strings. Knight has given us, hands down, the BEST Transformers movie to date. Its emphasis on human-and-robot drama and galaxy-traveling and its focus on character dilemmas amidst the action (as opposed to directionless action sequences) makes this film a blast to watch.What does this film do right where the others failed? It introduces the Autobots on Cybertron and establishes them as people fighting as a struggling resistance, not as CGI puppets who turn humans into computer rag-dolls whenever they hit them. Its plot also borrows elements from The Iron Giant, E.T. and even the original Star Wars; and it uses those tropes to make for a familiar yet refreshing experience at the movies (an actually GOOD live-action Transformers); and the 1980s Cold-War back-drop is just perfect for this film.This is what course-correction for a tired franchise looks like: it is to the Transformers franchise what Wonder Woman is to the DC Extended Universe movies. It's a film that left me pleasantly surprised and I want to see more of THESE types of Transformers movies. Fan service CAN be balanced with story and character, and this film is concrete proof Hollywood knows what the f##k it's doing with that; so there's no real excuse to expect less in that field now.Bumblebee gets 4.5/5 stars; I never thought I'd love it.",Bumblebee

74,vithiet,The kid in me liked it!,7,24 April 2020,"I've only seen 2 other Transformers movies out of the what, 13 they have by now? But this is the only one that really reminded me of the childhood cartoon (and toys!) I loved as a kid. Not sure if it's the 80s set up, the cool chick as main character, the fact that robots fighting no longer look like a junkyard having a seizure, or the lack of Bay at the helm, but it just works. Fun for the whole family!",Bumblebee
75,saptesh786,Child version of Transformers !!!,6,14 May 2019,"Just saw this title. I watched Transformers movies just one or antoher not all. So I am comparing this with them and found that this is a child version of Transformers. Here Transformer is small, Bumblebee behaving like child and his mentor Charlie ( Hailee Steinfeld) also a teenage girl, taking Bee's as child, looking humbling and messy many times. Main plot is same as Transformers but here only Bumblebee is in action, Optimus is disappeared from the scene. Starting part and end part both are watchable, but in the middle you can feel something boring family drama and a girl-boy drama. Some comical scene of Bumblebee is good and watchable especially for kids. Final climax is with high tension drama and feeling too unrealistic nearly, but keep in mind that you are watching a movie based on Transformers comics. Then everything is justified. Feel only thrill. As me it is recommended for kids especially. And who already saw Transformers series they will find nothing new. They may avoid this one. Acting by Hailee Steinfeld is perfect and noticeable but others are just okay. Crazy Credits at the end is watchable otherwise I am always avoid boring routine credits every time and look IMDB data for more information.",Bumblebee

The acting, script and dialogue is so bad that it made me cringe. The desire to make the story heartwarming ignores basic human reactions and emotions. The fact that other reviewers didn't feel this is amazing.The ridiculous plot of ""Hi, we are mega robot alien lifeforms. Pleased to meet you. Thanks for giving us access to your defense systems. Oh, and also thanks for not having any security around your security installations"" HahaLuckily the military have standard issue mega robot harpoons fitted to all Humvees.

77,jeremycrimsonfox,"Okay, But Still Proves The Franchise Has Much To Fix",5,8 June 2019,"Made as a prequel to the Transformers film franchise that is infamous for being horrible thanks to Michael Bay, it tries to mix things up. While Travis Knight replaces Michael as director, some things are improved while others show they still need some work. One of the good things is the Transformers themselves, as in the prologue, they actually look like how they did in the Generation One cartoon (complete with Soundwave having the digitized voice from the cartoon, despite not being played by Frank Welker, and the Transformers having better faces than in the last five films). And it is good to see Bumblebee as Volkswagon Beetle again.But the film is far from perfect. In fact, it's only okay. It still have the problems that plagued the last five films, as the humans get more screen time than Bumblebee or the two Decepticons, Shatter and Dropkick, who serve as the film's main antagonists. Also, I feel like nothing original was added to make it different, and while the setting of the movie is a good change, the main problem is it was done as a poor attempt to market off nostalgia of the original cartoon, and overloads on references to everything 80's done by Steven Spielberg (who is one of the film's executive producers) and the story looks like a rip-off of The Iron Giant, a film I would prefer over this. While it does some things right, this movie sadly shows the Transformers film franchise still has a long way to go if it intends on breaking the curse of being a bad movie franchise.",Bumblebee
78,sharky_55,There's a door in my way!,6,6 April 2019,"The way Bumblebee begins, a soft reboot of the much maligned live-action Transformers franchise, is strongly reminiscent of a kid sprawled out on his living room carpet, playing with his toy robots - there are brighter colours and clearer lines, and a whole lot less writhing metallic parts. The scenes are actually lit properly, a far cry from the murky, self-serious Bayhem of the past decade. All the action sequences are missing are the squiggly lines and all-caps BLAMS of a comic book, so cartoonish and flashy they are. When missiles detonate right into the throng of a US soldiers, their bodies are flung aside instead of disintegrated immediately. And the leader of this band of brothers? Yes, it's John Cena.This is a momentary relief for any fatigued audience member that has witnessed the IP trudge slowly into box-office red over the last ten years. Director Travis Knight wastes little time in resetting the universe, plunging straight into the story in-media-res and establishing the universe without the weighty pretentiousness of Michael Bay's pentalogy. With him it was all about the sunset creeping over a fluttering American flag, or slow motion embraces while soldiers salute in the background. Knight knows what the franchise needs is something that doesn't take itself so seriously. And isn't that what the fans of the original cartoon deserve?This is loud, obvious storytelling nonetheless, and for all the gushing of splitting from Bay's baggage, the plot skips along roughly the same beats. It is the late 80s (and if you hadn't noticed, the soundtrack will definitely tell you) and teenager Charlie Watson is the high school punching bag lacking the social capital of a sweet ride. Her father's death has left a diving pool-sized hole in her life, and she resents her mother for moving on quickly with Ron (a dirtbag's name for sure - when has a stepdad ever not been an antagonistic figure?). Her fortunes changes when she discovers Autobot-in-hibernation B-127, and their initial moments are done with poise and grace, steeped deeply in 'first contact' iconography harking back from E.T. all the way to The Shape of Water. There's a reason why that first touch of the outstretched hands still resonates with us.Bee makes an appropriate buddy for the angsty Charlie because his voice box is damaged, becoming a mute canvas for her to splatter exposition all over. Yet it's here where you begin to realise that you've been duped into watching a movie that's essentially a bright new coat of paint. I've already seen an anthropomorphised robot bumble around a house, with a swivel demolish half a kitchen bench. I've seen them fumble over human interactions and commit social faux-pas. Yes, none of them urinate all over a pompous federal agent, but that shouldn't be a selling point. If the bare minimum for a Transformers movie is avoiding juvenile phallic humour, perhaps it is better to let the series die after all. Let's not congratulate a director for merely resisting the urge to zoom into a close-up of the Chevrolet logo, as a lens flare flashes across the screen.The characters have simply been copy and pasted; there is the crazy scientist chewing scenery who wants to wield Decepticon tech for his own nefarious purposes, and then there is Cena's Lieutenant Jack Burns, a glaring sign that the producers could not afford The Rock. If Cena's prolific screen history won't sway you, neither will the consistent writing for his character. He begins as this iteration's benevolent Josh Duhamel figure, human counsel to the Autobots, dips briefly into a gun-toting southerner, then has a spell as a merciless robot hunter, and then finally ends with a firm salute that would make Bay's fetish for the military proud. They can't even get their archetypes right. He's not a human being; he's a G.I. Joe figurine.One key issue for the Transformers franchise has always been one of identity crisis; what kind of movies do they want to be? Most of the audience want to see Aubotots and Decepticons brawling it out, but these annoying humans keep wandering into the frame. If these people could hold our interest for more than a brief moment this might be justified, but they are neither complex nor challenging. Steinfield has moxie, but how far has she really come since her breakthrough of True Grit? By comparison this is a lazy turnout. The culmination of her arc comes when she finally 'dives in' to rescue Bee from sinking to an underwater grave, never mind the fact that she cannot hope to haul a two ton Autobot to the surface by herself. That's a factual error that is symptomatic of a broader thematic one; we don't really care whether she can take the plunge or not.",Bumblebee
79,phubbs,Bumblebee,5,27 March 2019,"The sixth (sixth!) installment in this tired crappy epileptic fit inducing CGI fest sees us going back to the 80's. Yes we're going back to the 80's yet again, well a 2019 politically correct revision of the 80's that is. Because we all wanted to know the origins of the Autobot Bumblebee right? Like how he got his name etc...ugh!The Plot (and a brilliant start!): The story kinda harks back to the original 1986 animated which saw Autobots fleeing Cybertron as the Decepticons gain an advantage in the war. Here we see the Autobots on the brink of defeat and Optimus Prime evacuating his last warriors to other planets. B-127 (Bumblebee) is chosen to go to Earth so he can set up a new base of operations for the Autobots. What follows is a pretty safe stereotypical plot where Bumblebee meets a teenage girl, makes friends, and must stop two other Decepticons from alerting the rest of the Decepticons and bringing them to Earth.The brilliant part of this movie (as I'm sure most will agree) is in fact the all CGI beginning showcasing the Cybertronian war on Cybertron. THIS is exactly what we the (original 80's) fans have wanted all along. This sequence was fantastic! Why? Because they actually recreated all the characters and Cybertron as they appeared in the classic cartoon and toy franchises. Cybertron looked like the Cybertron. Prime looked like Prime. We actually got Soundwave and Shockwave looking like Soundwave and Shockwave! And if you paid attention (throughout the movie, not just at the start) we also saw classic characters like Wheeljack, Brawn, Starscream, Cliffjumper, Thundercracker, Ratchet, and a wonderful little sequence with Ravage...including the original transforming sound effect!I can't stress how much I loved this opening sequence! It looked gorgeous! This was exactly what I've always wanted to see in a modern Transformer movie. The little flashbacks we get from Bumblebee give us some more of these sequences (which eventually gives us Ravage) and frankly that's all I wanted. I had literally no interest in the live action trash that followed.Live Action Trash: Yep so after the superb all CGI opening we got the rest...and it was just as crappy as all the previous Bay garbage. Naturally the lead protagonist is a strong female character, because that's all you're allowed now. Naturally her sidekick is a black guy, because that's the Hollywood standard couple now. Naturally the evil Decepticon was female, becau...ah fudge it.Bumblebee himself looks as he did in the Bayformer movies with minor changes which is fine I guess. Megatron is also not present, so I'm guessing this is for continuity reasons? I'm guessing this movie does tie in with the Bayformer movies?? Like what the hell is this supposed to be?? It hints at being connected...but how can it be??Unfortunately we still have the same damn issue of the people behind the movie creating new Transformers. Why??? Why do they keep doing this??? I know it's for toy sales but still...just use existing classic characters for flips sake! There are so many awesome characters to choose from. Stop creating crappy looking new characters! And why do they fire regular human-made bullets?? That literally makes no sense. And why do they know martial arts?? Stop it!There are other weird and annoying plot conveniences too such as Bumblebee's power core being damaged when he arrives on Earth. But when the girl finds him he's suddenly fine and dandy. So did he recharge or fix himself or something? John Cena's military character is literally the most stereotypically cliched military character you've ever seen with the most stereotypically cliched plot arc you've ever seen. Also when Bumblebee is on Cybertron he's a kickass Autobot warrior. When he's on Earth he acts like a little child or scared puppy...literally. What the hell is that about? A lame way to try and suck emotion from us the viewers as we watch a teenage girl play with her large Autobot puppy? Pfft!'you sound like a bumblebee, I'm gonna call you that'...What?? Literally what??And then you have the 80's nostalgia, good God. Both teenage characters bedrooms are like an advertisement from an 80's era Toy 'R' Us advert. That might sound logical but there was just something so clinical about the look, too perfect, too neat, too on the nose. I mean I grew up in the 80's but I never had multiple movie posters on the wall because back in the day movie posters weren't actually a thing you'd have or could get easily (unlike today).The locations were good I'll give it that. That classic sunny/misty Californian coastal town setting always seemed to suit the era. But just in case you forgot we were in the 80's you had the soundtrack. I think the movies smashes out a classic 80's tune every five minutes or so. Literally every scene change gets a new 80's track, its insane. One after another no matter what's happening, doesn't matter if the songs match the scenes, they just cram as many as they can in.Is this the Transformers movie we always wanted? No. Is this any different from the Bayformer movies? Not really no. Is the all CGI beginning of this movie what we always wanted? Hell yes! Why are they still making this live action rubbish? It's definitely the best Transformers movie so far, but it's not got much competition lets be honest. This movie only gets the score it does because of that beginning sequence. Other than that the rest of this movie is the usual bland safe rubbish you've come to expect from movies these days. Watch the CGI start then switch off and ponder what could have been.5/10",Bumblebee
80,rockman182,Bumblebee (2018),7,29 December 2018,"The Transformers film franchise is definitely something that divides viewers, more so in a negative light than positive. I love the first two films, its campy and dumb and rife with errors but still fun. The third has highlights as well. That's where they should have ended them. The Age of Extinction and The Last Knight were both absolutely incomprehensible, loud, and all around terrible. The franchise needed to end, so I was hesitant on a prequel/spinoff about Bumblebee. Michael Bay not being directly involved helps, because Bumblebee is a massive improvement over the latter films of the Transformers series.The film is about a teenage girl named Charlie Watson who is antsy to get her first car and settles on a Beetle, that turns out to be Bumblebee, an Autobot who is in hiding from Decepticons looking to persecute any associates of Autobot leader, Optimus Prime. Charlie gets caught in forming a bond with Bumblebee and the war between the opposing forces of the Transformers war. The film is directed by the filmmaker of Kubo and the Two Strings, which was relatively fantastic.I think Bumblebee is fortunately able to focus on its narrative and simplicity, than focusing on large scale action which makes it a coherent adventure. The story is built on telling rather than showing. The action scenes when they come are easier to follow than that of the Transformers series, and the reduction in numbers of Transformers make it a more focused venture. There's still weirdness in the film, mostly in the appearance of Steinfeld's co star Memo, which felt like an unnecessary inclusion.This film is likely the third best in the series for me, after the first two. Its fun, and has enough action to not make your head spin like the Mark Wahlberg led Transformers did. Still not sure if I want anymore films in the series but it was nice to see that the series could produce something good when the film switched hands from Bay to literally anyone else. Lastly, the film has a killer 80s soundtrack, which was pleasing.7/10",Bumblebee
81,jon.h.ochiai,"""Bumblebee"": Being Me Again",9,26 December 2018,"In Director Travis Knight's ""Bumblebee"" it's 1987: Hailee Steinfeld's 18 year-old Charlie stands as her beloved ""Bee"" readies to thrash the Special Forces soldiers led by John Cena's Jack Burns, who dared harm his dear friend Charlie. With tears in her eyes Charlie raises her and says, ""Stop.""There's an old movie adage: Never act with children or animals. These days that might apply to sentient scene-stealing towering metallic yellow robots, albeit entirely CGI. Yet, like her Charlie, Hailee is fearless, reminiscent of her Nadine in ""The Edge of Seventeen"", in her humanizing vulnerability. Bee's luminescent blue circle eyes do help, too. Director Travis of the stop action masterpiece ""Kubo and the Two Strings"", creates the authentically poignant bond with Bee and Hailee, which gifts this ""Transformers"" movie something unique: A heart.""Bumblebee"" is ""Transformers"" prequel humorously written by Christina Hodson that reinvents the exhausted ""Transformers"" franchise created by previous Director Michael Bay. No doubt Michael pushed the envelope in inventing the mesmerizing shiny objects of Autobots battling their mortal enemies, the Decepticons. But sacrificing humanistic storytelling in lieu of the ""blowing stuff up"" visually dependent narrative got old. Honestly, I stopped watching ""Transformers"" at ""Dark Side of the Moon"".The visual effects of ""Bumblebee"" are stunning like the opening battle sequence on the Transformers Home World - Cybertron. In the losing cause Autobot Leader Optimus Prime, voiced by noble Peter Cullen, instructs his charge - yellow warrior robot B-127, voiced by innocent Dylan O'Brien, to go to Earth and await for his return. And so it begins.Refreshingly, Travis and Hailee's distinct gift is their resonant emotional impact in the midst of the commercially driven special effects noise. Really, ""Bumblebee"" works, because Travis makes us cheer for the touching relationship of Charlie and Bee. ""Bumblebee"" is Hailee's movie. Her beautiful face and gentle eyes enroll us in the story of the lonely 18 year-old girl, who suffers from missing her Father, who passed away.Charlie's Dad taught her to fix cars and gave her his love of them. Charlie believes that if she can somehow restore her Dad's classic Corvette, she can have her Dad back. She can get herself back. In one scene Charlie stops repairing the Corvette in her garage. She cries, ""I can't do this anymore."" She just wants her suffering to end. Now that is way more captivating than a bunch of shining robots kicking the crap out of each other. Just saying.The memory and speech damaged B-127 lands on Earth disrupting the military exercise of Col. Jack Burns, played by strong funny John Cena. Fortunately, B-127 escapes capture; thus, embarrassing Jack. B-127 assumes the shape of a yellow Volkswagen Bug. Obviously.Charlie, played by Haile, is the loner high school gear-head only interested in cars, let alone boys. Charlie's Mom Sally, played by funny scattered Pamela Adlon, remarried Ron, played by comically well intentioned Stephen Schneider. Comfortably geeky Jason Drucker plays her karate nerd younger brother Otis. Insecurely charming Jorge Lendeborg Jr., of ""Love, Simon"", is Charlie's neighbor, who has the biggest crush on her. Finally summoning his courage to possibly ask Charlie out on date, he witnesses Bumblebee in full transformation. Charlie gives B-127 the name Bumblebee after recovering him from her Uncle's junkyard.Evil Decepitcons Shatter, voiced by frightening Angela Bassett, and Blitzwing, voiced by tough David Sobolov, land on Earth in search of Bee. They convince Jack and his superiors that they are the ""good guys"": That Bumblebee poses the gravest global threat. Actually, the Deceptions scheme to destroy the humans for their own strategic gain. So Jack must locate Bumblebee.Surprisingly, my favorite scene in ""Bumblebee"" is Charlie and Memo standing through the sunroof of the yellow Volkswagen, hands raised in the air with Tears for Fears singing ""Shout"" on the radio. That captured 1987, and the spirit of youth - being free to be yourself. You just didn't care what anyone else thought. That's also the distinct charm of Travis and Hailee's ""Bumblebee"". We see that sense of innocent wonder in Hailee's gaze. We all just want to be free to be ourselves.",Bumblebee
82,Benjamin-M-Weilert,A charming 80s nostalgia trip.,9,14 March 2019,"While I'm nowhere close to being a fan of the Transformers series, I'd occasionally watch the latest installment when it came to the cheap theater in town. I stopped doing this after the third film and only saw the fourth one on Redbox. I never even bothered with the most recent one. Then comes along this spinoff to the main storyline, Bumblebee (2018). For once, I was legitimately interested. The trailers made it seem like a cute little prequel/backstory for the practically mute robot in disguise. In the end, I was not disappointed, as Bumblebee was a fun and charming romp that showed what this franchise could have been like if Michael Bay didn't direct.I appreciated how this movie essentially went full-in with its nostalgia. After all, since the Transformers originated in the 1980s, why couldn't a film take advantage of this timeline to also reference lots of other 80s pop culture? Fortunately, it never went too over the top in these references but kept it to a nice gag every once in a while. It also didn't take itself too seriously, which almost made it more like an homage to 80s films like Short Circuit (1986) and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial (1982). This also probably helped make the action less nauseating and confusing, but I think this may have also been a factor of its director.Even though he's only directed one other film before Bumblebee, I think Travis Knight is quickly becoming one of my favorite directors. After all, his only previous directing credit was for Kubo and the Two Strings (2016), and I adored that film. In the end, if you want an excellent 80s nostalgia trip, Bumblebee is the movie for you. You don't even have to like Transformers for this film to be entertaining. If you've been turned off from this franchise before, I'd suggest forgetting that any of it ever happened and enjoy this film as your first foray into the realm of Transformers.A charming 80s nostalgia trip, I give Bumblebee 4.5 stars out of 5.",Bumblebee
83,RforFilm,You've got the touch! Bumblebee is probably the best Transformers movie so far,8,9 January 2019,"Oh boy, another Transformers movie and... wait a minute... Michael Bay isn't making this one? Okay movie, you've got one major thing fixed, but there's still some issues that need to be addressed. What about the characters, design of the robots, plot, effects...hmm...according to the previews, everything seems to be taking a turnaround from before. It's set in the 1980s and were focusing on a teenage whose not being objectified for the sake of sexuality? And the robots are designed similar to the animated series counterpart? Okay movie; now you really got me curious.You can't blame me or a lot of people for having low expectations when it comes to Transformers. I'm not as well read on the toys, shows, or comics, but the movies have been examples of ""fast food cinema""; where instead of substance and a compelling story, were given constant action scene after action scene set against well shot backdrops along with glorifying the military, bikini girls, and everything macho. I'd understand if people like that sort of thing, but it only worked for the first movie. The others have been overlong, dull, and even dumb. So with Bumblebee actually trying something lighter, it's persuaded me to give the series another chance now that director Travis Knight (Kubo and the Two Strings) is in charge.In 1987, a planet evacuation of Cybertron sends Bumblebee to Earth, where a special opts team called Sector 7 mistakes him for a treat and attack him. At the same time, a Decepticon follows Bumblebee and fights him while agent Jack Burns (played by John Cena) continues his assault. Though the Decepticon is defeated, Bumblebee loses his voice and hides in plain sight as a 1967 Volkswagen Beetle.Sometime later, teenager Charlie Watson (Played by Hailee Steinfeld) is still mulling over the death of her father while making it as a loner eighteen year-old. While working at her uncles junkyard, she gets the same yellow Beetle as a birthday present. Upon working on it at home, it transforms into Bumblebee who is without a voice and scared from his encounter from Sector 7. This establishes right away that he's not a threat and Charlie vows to protect him. So while trying get his memory back, Charlie tries to get him to stay hidden. At the same time, two Decepticons intercept Sector 7 and agree to work with them in exchange to access to the worlds communications system in order to find Bumblebee.I'm glad to say the big changes were all for the good as Bumblebee may be the best Transformers movie of the franchise, even better then the first. It wasn't just a good movie on it's own, but it felt like I was watching a live action adaptation of the 1980's cartoon. A lot of it is because a long with a smaller story, I finally felt like that several characters had genuine arcs. Bumblebee changes and learns to trust people. Charlie learns to accept her father's passing and move on. Even Jack learns about the value in something we don't understand. The script actually understood that personalities affect story and can go through something to make something of the plot.If some of this is sounding familiar, it's because Bumblebee took a lot of inspiration from E.T., WarGames, and a lot of 1980's style movies. What Travis Knight knew was that the majority of those movies knew how to capture the innocence of an adolescent. Hailee Steinfeld does well at playing this kind of character (which some might see as similar to Edge of Seventeen, but she seems to have some idea of what she wants to do later in life).The actions scenes are also improved upon thanks to the fact that their better shot and aren't as needed within the story. Bumblebee relies more on the connection between this car and human then on the thousands of explosions that Michael Bay had used.Is Bumblebee a masterpiece? Probably the best a Transformers movie can become. What I mean is that it isn't a game changer to this story, but it is at least really good at it. It's entertaining and knows how much to give before taking the toys away.I'll give this eight old Transformers animation cels out of ten. I'll be curious to see if this is going to a part of the old series (which it makes that connection) or if it's a part of a bigger reboot. I'm hoping for the latter as this deserves to be a starting point to something better. Autobots, roll out and go see it.",Bumblebee
84,fernandoschiavi,"The main thing about ""Bumblebee"" is simplicity, without the obligation to transform the action genre into a grandiose epic, a complex drama, full of countless characters",7,27 May 2020,"""Bumblebee"" derives from Hasbro's Transformers franchise and takes place in 1987. Initially publicized as a prequel and spin-off, it was later declared a reboot of the franchise and proves that most of the time, less is more. Even though he is still one of the producers of the feature, this is the first film in the franchise not directed by him, and it was just the breath she needed, managing to recover the spirit of the first Transformers. It cannot be said, on the other hand, that the five films captained by Bay have no identity. The ensemble possessed a skeleton - without going into merit or demerit. What is missing there is heart. While those were practically forced attempts at grandiose, megalomaniacal epics, filmed from many extravagant plans and that often made the action incomprehensible - aided by a convulsive montage - Bumblebee aims at an almost complete opposite.1987. Refugee in a junkyard in a small beach town in California, Bumblebee, a yellow Volkswagen Beetle, bruised and without condition, is found and repaired by young Charlie (Hailee Steinfeld), on the eve of turning 18. Only when Bee comes to life does she finally notice that her new friend is much more than just a car.The sensitivity of Christina Hodson's script is at the heart of this film and shows what all other films in the franchise lack: feeling. Much more than a film with megalomaniac action sequences, the script focuses on the friendship of the girl Charlie with Bumblebee, the most charismatic and beloved of the Autobot. Both meet and create strong bonds of friendship. While Charlie helps Bee to recover his voice, his memories and helps him when he finds himself alone and afraid on a strange planet, besides worrying about protecting him from the external evils that his exposure will cause, Bee helps her to overcome her depression and moving on, facing her fears, caring and relating again, in short, to be who she was before her father died. Most of the film is precisely in the construction of the relationship between the two and later with the neighbor Memo (Jorge Lendeborg Jr.) who nurtures a passion for the young woman.Every minute of the first act seems to seek identification with the public. For this, we see invested much less in the war between Autobots and Decepticons and more in the relationships that surround Charlie's life (Hailee Steinfeld): the longing for his father, the conflicting relationship with his mother and brother and the rejection of his stepfather. This search for identification with the viewer is of a beauty that gains sensitive outlines especially from Steinfeld's charisma. The girl not only has a performance that convinces with great competence in her interactions with the alien robot that gives the film its name, but she also quietly goes through scenes of solitary dialogues, which generally disconcert many experienced people. Thus, Bumblebee directs his attention, his focus, to a human vision of events, avoiding raising his story from the creation of a dangerous alien look at humanity. Not that it lacks elements of the type - since human fragility is revealed with sarcasm when a Decepticon reflects on the onomatopoeia ""pop"" that makes a man explode -, but there is much more to a film about the power of friendship than about a flashy and grandiloquent production about the danger of the human race being wiped out by robotic aliens.The truth is that, with more space for intimacies, the Bumblebee production manages to hit on points never reached before by the Transformers films. If Steinfeld's performance is noteworthy, the same can be said of Sean Haworth's Production Design (from Deadpool), which builds a world full of references to the 1980s. From movie posters to stage objects, everything seems to complement what wants to be passed on to the viewer. If at a moment, for example, the befitting poster for the film The Enigma of Another World (by John Carpenter, 1982) is revealed prominently, the art team never tires of positioning the film in its period through cars and even helicopter that turns the Decepticon Dropkick (a Bell AH-1SuperCobra). In addition to the look of the time and the songs (the musical soundtrack is excellent), another nice point of the script is not to focus on the mess of robot battles that no one understood where one started and the other ended.
Not only in the artistic quality of the project, but in its purposes. The proportion is the same sometimes, but inverted: As in Transformers (2007) and in Transformers: Revenge of the Losers (2009) Michael Bay explored the body of Megan Fox (and in the following ones, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley and Nicola Peltz), here Travis Knight seems to respond, covering Hailee Steinfeld with absolute respect. But it is not that the young actress finds herself trapped or deprived of physical attention. Despite playing a solitary and alternative half-adult, the team does not want to build it as someone without vanities. Charlie cares about you, but understands that it is much more than a body thanks to Hodson's script.The director, a specialist in stop-motion works, brings lightness to his direction and does a better job than Bay. The director was able to exercise - in the meticulousness that the medium requires - his first steps in composing paintings, moving on stage. The best scenes, not by chance, are those that function as a crescent of physical jokes and pantomime, playing with the contrast of the giant beetle robot in a disproportionate environment. Upon taking over Bumblebee, the first Transformers-derived film, Knight carries this care with him, in order to return the franchise to childish enchantment. It is as if the film tries to rescue the spirit of Michael Bay's first Transformers, not only in the premise - a boy wins his first car, with Shia LaBeouf here replaced by Hailee Steinfeld - but also in the comic dynamics of those first scenes of ""robots in disguise ""in the Witwicky garden.Knight manages to bring emotion and a human side to the robot, which was, above all, a war machine, a fireball from space, fleeing all the destruction of Cyberton, with the mission of setting up a base for resistance. Bumblebee's transformations are also a positive point and an evolution in the franchise. Realists, as far as possible, show the car parts and the steps between being a beetle and a humanoid robot, and bring it closer to the public. On the other hand, the action scenes, however, alternate good car chases with too simple fights, which fail to explore the potential of a battle between the giant machines.The main thing about ""Bumblebee"" is simplicity, without the obligation to transform the action genre into a grandiose epic, a complex drama, overload the work of countless characters or expose any narrative full of intellectuality, burning neurons for free, has the ability to to be one of the greatest virtues of a millionaire production like this, because it reduces risks, focuses on content that makes other secondary issues more important and drives success. The feature film never detracts from what is going on between the robot and the girl, quite the opposite, completely stifling the narrative about ""saving the world"", which is more interesting for the heart of this new approach to the franchise not to forget its proposals.Knight, therefore, commands a less anxious treatment for the great misadventures that, previously, Michael Bay never managed to capture with the same wit that other narratives with epic bias managed, sabotaging his project, in the five opportunities, but different proportions, when a monstrous fatigue it ended up being obligatory for a spectator unhappy with that insanity. The action scenes here are not sublime, however, the most showy characters - for example, the great Bumblebee design - as well as the option for much less cuts and fewer explosions - not the nonexistence, however - contribute to a fun. It's cool to see the robots with a cleaner and nostalgic look, close to the first generation of dolls, which already makes everything much less brown than with Bay; and also in the little flashes of choreography, as in the scene where Bumblebee discovers the whole house. Not by chance, these are the moments of more computer graphics, less cuts between planes, closer than Knight brings with stop-motion. We also have the soundtrack of Dario Marianelli (Oscar winner for ""Atonement"") who knows how to move and excite at the precise moments, extracting the best from each scene.""Bumblebee"" reaches all generations: the one that enjoyed the explosions that characterized the last ten years of the franchise; the older ones who saw Transformers on TV in the 1980s; and a new generation, who just got to know the franchise, through the friendly and lost look of the robot that was a yellow beetle. The film spares no effort to keep censorship free: the weapons turn people into a kind of snot (they are dead, but not so ugly on the screen). The mood is light, taking advantage of the robot's unsuccessful attempts to adapt to the new planet, and plays with the songs and objects of the 1980s.",Bumblebee

86,mitsubishizero,How a Transformers movie should be made!,10,15 May 2019,"It's basically The Iron Giant meets E.T. and I mean that in a good way. This's the Transformers movie we all wanted. Travis Knight did a great job directing this movie. The film begins with Optimus Prime and the Autobots fighting against the Decepticons on their home planet Cybertron. Realising they're losing Prime orders a retreat and evacuates the rebels to earth while he holds them off. Among the evacuated is Bumblebee(Dylan O' Brien). Shortly after Bee lands on earth he's greeted by the military lead by Jack Burns(John Cena). While trying to escape he's then forced to briefly fight Decepticon Blitzwing(David Sobolov) who rips his vocal chord out and leaves him for dead afterwards. Before passing out he transforms into a rusty Beetle. Meanwhile, Hailee Steinfeld plays a teen named Charlie, A cynical tomboy with a knack for mechanics still grieving from her father's death while also dealing with her nosy younger brother and her Mom whom she resents for hastily moving on to her boyfriend Ron.One day while celebrating her birthday she comes across Bumblebee disguised as a Beetle and makes a deal with the owner after expressing how badly she wants it. While tampering with it in her garage she meets Bumblebee and is forced to hide him from the rest of her family(whom she didn't tell she bought a car in the first place). Slowly and slowly they get to know each other while also trying to keep Bumblebee out of sight from both the military and the Decepticons. This movie was great! It has a balance of heart, humor and well written lines. The main characters are likable and you really care for them. Being that it's in the 80's there're a lot of references 80's kids would get both from the time period and possibly from the franchise itself. The action's well done. It's well choreographed and paced instead of confusing like in the previous Transformers movies. I really laughed at some of the jokes and scenes such as when Bumblebee accidentally trashes Charlie's house and when her younger brother throws up after an interesting chase scene. The story's simple but effective for previously stated reasons. If you're a Transformers fan or into 80's nostalgia then this movie's a must watch. Take it for what it's worth and see for yourself, you won't be disappointed. Not by a long shot.",Bumblebee
87,markthomassintek,Great introduction to the Transformers franchise for younger audiences,8,15 December 2018,"REVIEW - BUMBLEBEEUS release date 21 December
UK release date 24 DecemberYes its finally here, the back story for possibility the most iconic Transformer not including Optimus Prime of course, yes it's time to float like a butterfly and sting like a Bumblebee.But, ok lets start from the beginning. My biggest gripe with Transfers was the fighting sequences between the various robots because whilst impressive were just too fast but I'm so glad to say that this film totally overcome that by what I can only describe as filming read fighters and then overlaying the robots on top because the movement is more realistic and because of this you can actually appreciate what is going on.Most of the film tells the story of the developing friendship between Bumblebee and Charlie with the only real robot on robot fight coming nearly towards the end of the film.Whilst the film is very enjoyable and actually made me laugh out loud number of places""that driving was rad"" for example (watch the film, no spoilers) the biggest problem for me came at the very end whilst over looking the Golden Gate Bridge in San Fransisco. Ok this had to happen to allow Bumblebee to do what he does in the rest of the Transformers franchise but with so much time of the film put into developing the friendship to do what was inevitable just felt wrong.Kids will love it, there is one scene with the F word so be warned but in general a very good and very funny film and worth going to see over the holiday period.For the more grown up amongst us, I feel this is aimed at a younger audience and this makes common sense because I bet they are hoping to introduce a whole new younger audience to the Transformers franchise.Rating 8 out of 10",Bumblebee
88,allanmichael30,still not original story,5,20 December 2019,This has some elements from the cartoon but still rewriting the story in a bad way.,Bumblebee
89,kjproulx,An Improvement Over What This Franchise Has Become,6,13 December 2018,"The live-action Transformers franchise that has been running since 2007 is incredibly divisive at best. Although many people still continue to praise that original film, it's also disliked just as much. As far as the sequels go, it's really a matter of how much you find them annoying. Personally, aside from Transformers: Dark of the Moon, I think the sequels continued to get worse and worse. Transformers: The Last Knight was the final nail in the coffin for me, as it was easily one of the worst big budget films I've ever seen. When the first pieces of marketing landed for this new Bumblebee film, I was very optimistic about where they had decided to take this series. While I can say that most people will be able to agree on the fact that it's easily the best film to come out since the original and is possibly even superior to all of the previous movies, it still didn't do much to impress me either.Taking place in the late 1980s, Bumblebee follows the Transformer known as Bumblebee as he is sent to Earth after a devastating event on their home planet of Cybertron. Followed by two Transformers who have a completely different agenda, they make life difficult for him on this planet, as well as the humans they encounter. A young woman in Charlie Watson discovers that an old car from the junkyard is actually a transforming robot and they form a bond that sets the heart of this story in motion. Many viewers will watch this movie and probably be moved by the relationship these two share and while it does have some fantastic moments, I just thought this story was far too similar to other films, without much new to offer.In terms of storytelling, Bumblebee strips away the overly complex narratives that this franchise gave us throughout the last decade and truly makes a very simplistic story between a girl and her robot, and what consequences may arise from that. Comedy is subjective, but I sadly felt some of the same dumb humour very present here. Although the action is much more visible and the emotions are real, they're undercut by some cringe-worthy lines of dialogue. Not that this ruined the movie for me, but it did take me out of the experience at times.As far as the cast goes, Hailee Steinfeld continues to act circles around each and every cast member that she has to work with. Whether it's her devoted performances in movies like The Edge of Seventeen or her fun attitude throughout the Pitch Perfect movies, I've always enjoyed her on-screen. This may be her best performance yet, but this is not the point I'm trying to make. With a central character as well-performed as Charlie, the rest of the cast definitely falls by the wayside, with a big asterisk on John Cena. While I like him in comedies, I just don't believe he can pull off real drama. As the head military officer, his dialogue was either meant to be cheesy and laughable or serious, which I felt came off as more comedic than dramatic. I know that this is the tone they were obviously going for, but it really didn't work for me.In the end, fans of Transformers will get a kick out of the action and average moviegoers will more than likely be able to latch onto the human characters and actually care about them this time around. This familiar story makes for a much stronger film in the Transformers franchise, but it doesn't feel all that original. Although I enjoyed watching this movie for the most part and can recommend it to all ages, I don't think many risks were taken to spice up this stale story. Bumblebee has some great moments throughout, but as an overall film, it didn't impress me enough to warrant a glowing recommendation.",Bumblebee
90,Neptune165,the worst Transformers in the franchise,3,10 May 2019,"It looks weird without explosions and cities getting destroyed, If you are going in expecting it to be action packed then you will be disappointed.

Michael Bay had caused a numb sensation since the original was released and Bumblebee was a welcomed surprise. The film is a little one dimensional at times, but this felt like an Amblin worthy film.

Happy to see Bay move on, even though his action scenes were incredible to watch.",Bumblebee
92,Darkside-Reviewer,Another 80s nostalgia movie because there's just not enough of those,5,21 December 2020,"Bumblebee is the first live action Transformers movie not directed by Michael Bay and while Bumblebee is definitely a step in the right direction for the Transformers series it's by no means the amazing Transformers movie that it's made out to be. Everyone knows Transformers is a cartoon series which was insanely popular in the 80s and early 90s so with that basic piece of information what do you get? The answer... Another reboot filled with 80s nostalgia of course.The main problem with Bumblebee is that it's just a rehash of the previous (Bay) Transformer movies with just a few minor adjustments made and a different director. The main characters personality is just a mix of tired old character cliques that we have seen a million times before. We have all seen this kind of lazily written and unoriginal character played a million times before in these kinds of movies. The backstory is always the same a nerdy and unpopular teenager in this case a girl who doesn't fit in at school, doesn't have any friends, has lost her dad to some kind of accident or disease. She is unable to move on from her dad dying and as a result she acts out causing trouble for everyone around her. She has an obsession with music that just gives the movie an excuse to play dated 80s songs that have been played to death and last but not least the character has a weird hobby or obsession in this case the girl fixes up cars not because she is genuinely interested in cars or because she wants to be an engineer or something actually realistic nope she fixes cars for her dead father so the plot can lead to her finding a broken down Bumblebee so she can fix him up ""again!"". This kind of character isn't new or interesting her name in the credits could of been main character number 1 because that's the amount of effort it took to write this character.The first fifteen minutes of the movie are awsome we get the Autobots and the Decepticons fighting on the Transformers home planet of Cybertron. The effects look awsome the Transformers look closer to their original designs it's what every fan of Transformers wanted from this movie. Sadly after the fifteen minute mark the movies effects budget runs out and we get to go to earth set in the 1980s because! Geez we've never had a movie like that before.There are parts of the movie that are done very well for example the designs for the Autobots and Decepticons are much closer to their original designs from the cartoon. The sad thing is though sadly their aren't many scenes that involve or even show any of the other Transformers except of course for Bumblebee and two very generic Decepticon villains who are off screen for most of the movie. The Bumblebee character spends more time disguised as a Volkswagen Bettle than he does in his actual robot form and even when he's on screen fully all he does for the most part is some unfunny scenes like trying to fit his head through a doggy door or sit on a sofa breaking it ""hahaha"".This movie should of just been about the Transformers and the war for Cybertron. All this movie needed to be was Autobots Vs the Decepticons in an all out war for Cybertron but nope instead we get Bumblebee crash landing on earth in the 1980s so he can hide out in teenage girls garage for half the movies running time. All this movie is is a soundtrack of every over used 80s song with a ton of unfunny references to Transformers and the nostalgia of the 1980s. I am no fan of the Michael Bay Transformer movies but I will say this they at least contained explosions, over the top robot battles, swearing and absolutely no scenes of a Transformer playing ""Never gunna give you up"" on full blast.",Bumblebee

96,SoumikBanerjee25,"Sorry, I couldn't fathom such Representation of a Transformer Based Movie!",5,10 April 2020,"Before I begin I must say, I might be in the Minority here. As I was reading through all the reviews and opinions; it seems most of the audience loved it and some of them actually held it much higher even than the first Transformer movie. I was so awkwardly surprised. I mean Fine, Audience got bored of typical Michael Bay directions perhaps. But To say this is better than the first one is surely a bluff. The first movie came out When I was just 11 years old. I absolutely loved that movie. It made me fall in love with this Transformer universe. As I was growing up; Sequels started to coming out one by one. Most of them I agree lacked good storylines and Deep Character builds but I enjoyed them all (Except the last one, that was horrible). Transformers movies are meant to entertain you with its jaw dropping action sequences and visually mesmerizing CGI. And with the needed expertise; Michael Bay in my opinion sufficiently did justice to all the Films in that regard. Here Travis Knight did a Nicer job on the direction front, maybe yes. But He got it all wrong. He tried to put it in his own style and that's totally ok. It's his film anyway and he must have some Liberty to do whatever he wants with it. But that doesn't mean he could ruin the Basic essence of a Transformer movie!
The actions were few and far between. Characters were never really fleshed out. Except Charlie played by Hailee Steinfeld; others looked horribly bad. The events that unfold in the plot makes not much sense on so many parts. For example When the decepticons arrived and requested help from the officials. They said ""Our scanners are limited in range"" but only few moments back they traced Bumblebee's Signal from All the way back in Saturn!! I mean seriously? And The comic relief they tried to bring in here totally failed on most of the occassions. With only few chuckles landed on point. A big shy. Comparing to the first movie; that was way hilarious and Entertaining for sure. I could never think anyone other than Shia Lebouf For the main lead in a Transformer film. His character as Sam Witwicky is so likable and relatable. Whereas the other ones looks soulless and easily forgettable. Here The character of Charlie had the potential to overcome and be a important character that I might remember for a longer period of time but Weaker writing and Half Baked execution of character traits failed to do so. Though I loved the battle scenes here, they are well choregraphed and Bumblebee as a character has definitely shined through. It's the most humane interpretation of a Giant Alien Robot. So yeah that's the part they did pretty good.
As a whole for me it's a bang average movie with enough elements to help you through the sitting for once. But definitely it doesn't have that ""Spark"" that could urge me to watch it for the second time!",Bumblebee

98,Min111,It's a prequel to Transformers,7,4 August 2020,"I'm a fan of Transformers, so I decided to see Bumblebee, and I was impressed. I knew it would be a good movie. I gave a rating of seven, but it could be worth more than that. I seen three of the Transformers movies - Transformers, Revenge of the Fallen and Dark of the Moon. The first and third movie were great movies. The second one was okay. You don't need to see the Transformers movies in order to see Bumblebee since it's a prequel anyway. Though it would be better to see the Transformers movies once you've seen Bumblebee. The Transformers is a sequel. In the movie, the leader of the Autobots, Optimus Prime, sends one its members (B-127) to Earth to form a base, so they can later regroup along with the other members of the Autobots. In Cybertron, the Autobots are losing the civil war against the Decepticons, so they prepare to get out of the planet, and head straight to Earth. The first member that was sent happens to go by the name 'Bumblebee' who happens to be yellow. Bumblebee eventually reaches Earth. It crashes and lands in California. On Earth, Bumblebee, later, is friends with a girl named Charlie Watson. Before Bumblebee and Charlie met, and became friends, Charlie found a yellow Volkswagen Beetle at a scrapyard. She's given the car as a gift; it's a birthday present. Let's not forget the Decepticon members such as Blitzwing, Dropkick and Shatter. These are Decepticons that Bumblebee had to fight. Luckily, he won every battle. Also, there was another person named John Cena who is famous for his 'wrestling' in the WWE (World Wrestling Entertainment). It was nice to see him starring in movies. I know about his other movie - The Marine. He played Agent Burns by the way. There was another character named Memo who happens to like Charlie romantically. I liked Bumblebee. It's a good prequel. There was so much action to be found. It really reminds me of The Transformers. It's pretty similar. I hope there are more movies like that. I like the front cover by the way - it looks nice. It's an adventure movie; I happen to like adventure movies. Bumblebee towards the end takes on a new design - Chevrolet Camaro. (Previously, it took on the appearance of a Volkswagen Beetle.) You see that into the next movie called The Transformers.",Bumblebee

102,Beejerman,CHEER! - (8 stars out of 10),8,18 March 2019,"The stage curtains open ...""Bumblebee"" takes place during the Summer of '87 when our film's main protagonist, Charlie Watson, has just turned 18 years old and is doing her best to cope with the loss of her Dad. I was also 18 during the summer of 1987. I knew Charlie and I remember the events of this film just like it happened yesterday. In fact, Charlie and I have remained lifelong friends and we still talk often. (LOL - just kidding). But, I was 18 during that summer.Our story starts out with the Autobots losing control of their home planet, Cybertron. As a last ditch effort, Optimus Prime sends B-127 to Earth, a well hidden location by their reckoning, and their only hope for sanctuary, until they can rebuild their strength and find a new way to face the Decepticons. B-127 hides out in the form of a yellow, VW Bug where Charlie finds him. She is given the car as a birthday gift from a well-meaning friend and she discovers that her car really isn't a car at all ... it is B-127 who she renames, Bumblebee. Together, they become fast friends, and work in unison to stop two renegade Decepticons from destroying the planet and any hope of the Autobot's survival.This sure was a fun return - not only to the time period, but to the allure of the Transformers. You really felt for Charlie, who desperately needed Bumblebee's friendship during the bitterness and emptiness that followed the death of her father. The special effects are what we have come to expect from a transformer film, the story was well developed, and the pacing was right on. I enjoyed the characters. Hailee Steinfeld was perfect in her role as Charlie.This is a high recommend. I feel it is one of the best movies in the Transformers universe and I'm anxiously anticipating the sequel that is being planned for it.",Bumblebee

John Cena's acting and the military presence just seemed a little on the cheap side, but everything else was pretty good.I hate to single out John Cena's, because usually he's alright, but there was just something off about his acting/character.I like this era of films (late 1980's -- when I grew up, which it tries to emulate), and they did a good job of making it seem like it was shot in that era.",Bumblebee

Bumblebee is not something extraordinary. But is something very cool. It is a heart whelming movie with lots of fun. Hailee Steinfeld did a good job and the visual effects were also good.

107,statuskuo,The Transformers Movie Gen Xers Wanted,8,22 December 2018,"Where was this movie before?
Oh right...Michael Bay. The all-tech no heart helmer of the previous catastrophe. The brightest thing this franchise has done was 1) hire Christina Hodson to brilliantly draw the necessary elements from ""Transformers: The Movie 2) keep it simple.
The sweetness and lack of 2018 cynicism is gone. Here is the adorable Haillee Steinfeld, who plays Charlie Watson, a teen into adult grease monkey who has lost someone dear to her. In her daily life, we realize she struggles to let go of her past. Meanwhile, in some other galaxy a war wages on between the Autobots and the Decepticons (presumably for an energy source). Now that their planet is near extinction, Optimus Prime, oh how we've missed you...I mean the post-Bay Prime, sends Bumblebee to the outer reaches to create a new home base. Um...Earth to regroup. Though a little clunky in getting Bee to Charlie, it is exceptionally effective once the emotions kick in. Which is supported by a nostalgic and heart pumping soundtrack from the mid-late 80's (since this takes place in 1987). The love of the auto is essentially a bridge for Charlie which is (pun intended) repaired with another alien. Sound familiar? Yep, executive producer Steven Spielberg has just given up enough leash to re-do ""E.T."" as well. Who cares? It is a movie needed to remind us what good movies were. Before all the angry politics, bully jerks, and miserable world news. This is wholesome (but still pretty violent) film that somehow bridges modern sensibility and 80's fun. For my generation, a lot will feel familiar (mostly because of the soundtrack) but it has a TON of heart buoyed by Steinfeld's tough girl with a wounded heart. I suspect a new template character may be born that ""The Legend Of Billie Jean"" missed out on, or was just too soon.
The message really needed no heavy hand, and it smartly adds a breezy touch MANY thanks to director Travis Knight (Nike's Phil Knight's son). He really skates a nice circle around the fact that the lead is a girl and that we can just have fun instead of hammering people with social messages.
I had a ton of fun at this movie and found myself listening to the music on my way home from the theater. Breezy fun.",Bumblebee

117,PyroSikTh,Probably the Best Transformers Movie,7,8 January 2019,"The film opens with a civil war on Cybertron (which is just about the only thing I've wanted to see since the first movie), and Bumblebee escaping to a 1980s Earth, where he's accosted by a group of startled soldiers, and followed by a missile-wielding Decepticon, losing his voice and his memory before being rediscovered some time later in a junk pile in the form of a VW Beetle. This is where he meets our human protagonist Charlie, a rock-loving teenager without a father, who takes Bumblebee in like a stray dog, fixing him, teaching him about the human world, and letting him stay in her garage.As far as Transformers movies go, the plot is super simple; Bumblebee's literally just being hunted by Decepticons while he befriends a young woman, with the military getting wrapped up in the whole affair. Instead the story puts its attention more on the characters, more specifically Charlie and Bumblebee as they get to know each other, bring out previously unseen aspects of each others personalities, and grow to accept who they are and what their life is like. While still far flung from high art, or any real kind of dramatic accolade, it goes a long way to making us actually care about the characters we're following. When Bumblebee trashes Charlie's house, it stings because of the inevitable consequences it will mean for both of them as characters.But the action's still here in spades, and debately done much better than the Bayformers movies. Shaky cam is pretty much gone, mindless beat-'em-ups are gone, and with lower stakes, the film gets more opportunities to make the most of every fight without bogging them down in humour or exposition dumps. The actual act of transforming is used to great effect as well, with each of them transforming through their forms to get the upper edge, or in one particularly brutal case being a distinct disadvantage (sorry Dropkick).There's still humour here as well, but it's much more mature, used sparingly, and is there to lighten the mood more than be a slapstick distraction. John Cena is a particular stand-out, embodying the typical 80s action hero role, complete with cheesy one-liners. This sounds bad, but it's actually a positive as it reinforces the film's obvious reverence of 80s cartoons and movies. It almost feels like a movie from the 80s, like The Breakfast Club or The Goonies in tone. That said it's not without its faults, and its biggest for me was the character of Memo, who I just found annoying from the very offset. Like I get he's meant to be an awkward nerd, but as an awkward nerd myself, I can still identify when someone's probably a little too busy and preoccupied to talk, and never would I barge into the garage of a neighbour, especially one I'd barely spoken to. Just like, dude, leave her alone maybe?It was actually a pleasant surprise of a movie thanks to someone else being behind the camera. Michael Bay's had his chance now, it's time to give it to someone else. I'm still yet to see Kubo and the Two Strings, but Travis Knight definitely seems to have an affinity for this kind of story. While Bumblebee is not a great movie by any stretch of the imagination, it's definitely one of the best Transformers movies, if not the best. The cool factor was up, the Bumblebee factor was up, the annoyance factor was down. This is the kind of movie we'd have gotten if they amplified the best bits in the first film rather than the more questionable ones. I give Bumblebee a thoroughly entertaining 7/10.",Bumblebee

Also the action scenes that do take place are much easier to follow since camera doesn't jump around all the time and the Autobots/Decepticons have different color schemes and don't just become a grey blur.

120,JakeBrinkman,"A solid ""okay"" movie",4,18 April 2019,"Bumblebee is a nice change in pace from the Transformers series, which has shown some seriously bad writing and a decline in animation quality as the series continues. The action and story in this movie are on a much smaller scale, which allows for more character development and more time for the animators to produce quality CGI, which is a step back on track. However, Steinfeld didn't seem to have as strong of chemistry with Bumblebee or as much personality as Labeouf did in the first 1-2 movies. Also, I think they toned the action down a little too much because I don't remember any of the scenes in Bumblebee being as awesome as the action of the first 1-2 movies.",Bumblebee
121,Offworld_Colony,Not a terrible love letter to The Iron Giant.,7,10 February 2020,"The Gen 1 Transformers look a little goofy against the backdrop of Bay's hyper-mechanical redesigns which I actually liked, and I constantly felt as if the script could have been super-delicious after just one or two more drafts and annoyingly Bumblebee's expressiveness could have been ramped up a little more, the interactions between Charlie and Bee could have been better conceived. However, those nitpicks out of the way, Bumblebee is a well made love-letter to Amblin entertainment and to Gen 1 Transformers. Female writer and female lead spearhead a film full of lovely little quirks, which really shine considering how much they're lacking from Bay's slew; such as the soldier to soldier connection at the end, and the film is full of actual belly laughs, I'm looking at you The Smiths-tape scene. The fight scenes are very good, the brother is hilarious, and the soundtrack is chunky. I was actually giggling with delight when Bumblebee escapes the cop by half driving half running through the tunnel, there's something refreshing about seeing all thus lore and technology be put to good honest use instead of the garish nightmare of Bay's business.
Transformers Origins: Bumblebee is a charming diversion, pure honest fun around a a generic plot and a typically sloppy third act. It's a nice enough diversion, if a little forgettable due to its devotion to being rock-solid, instead of being a little out-there.",Bumblebee
122,ethanbresnett,So Transformers films can be good! Who'd have thunk it?,7,7 March 2020,"This was a pleasantly surprising way to return to the Transformers franchise after having skipped the Last Knight.Bumblebee was a still a Transformers film, so I wasn't expecting a transfixing plot or watertight script, however neither were bad and were well above par for the franchise. Ultimately the film had a lot of charm.A lot of this charm was provided through Hailee Steinfeld who delivered a solid performance, bringing a decent amount of believable emotion to the character. Charlie was an interesting enough character to keep me entertained, and I did find myself invested in her trails and tribulations throughout the film. Perhaps the less said about John Cena's performance the better... In his defence he was apportioned the more clunky sections of the script, and he deserved slightly better from the writers I felt.My main criticism of Bumblebee would be that I found the action wanting. I appreciate that Bumblebee was going for a different vibe to previous instalments, placing a stronger emphasis on the human element of the story, so I'm not overly mad about it. However I did find the film stuck slightly in limbo as the action was reigned in but the character development wasn't all there either. When the action was there it felt fresh in comparison to other Transformers films. The fights were clearer, and since there weren't numerous Transformers piling into each fight it was much easier to follow who was who (which wasn't always the case in previous films).The direction and cinematography were often well done, with some great shots and good grounding in the era.Bumblebee wasn't amazing, but it was enjoyable and very watchable.

126,stevenrotherforth,Franchise is back on track,8,18 May 2019,"BumblebeeIt's no surprise to anyone that the Transformers franchise has been on a downward slide ever since the first film.
Sure there's been a glimmer of hope here and there but Michael Bay has time and time again gone for style over substance.
The first Transformers film was bold, loud and colourful with jaw dropping visuals but the sequels grew tiresome with ever increasing contrived storylines and the unfunny humour.Bumblebee however is a fresh and much needed franchise reboot.
With a new director at the helm. Travis Knight has delivered a film that is laden with fan service and by that I mean fans of the 80's cartoon and toys.
Bumblebee plays like E.T but with a robot.
The plot is familiar if you've seen the Spielberg classic.
Alien befriends young earthling blah blah. You know the rest.
As with all the Transformers movies the visuals are mightily impressive but here this film has a heart at its core and humour that's actually funny and isn't crass or a little creepy.
There's no unnecessary close ups of young ladies midriffs whilst some cheesy rock ballad belts out in the background.
Furthermore Knight's film follows the current trend of tugging at those nostalgia strings. Accompanied by a banging 80's soundtrack this film has a feel good vibe like many of the movies from that decade.Hailee Steinfeld leads a committed cast as young Charlie. A teenage girl reeling from the loss of her father who befriends a beat up old VW Beetle.
The friendship between girl and robot blossoms as Charlie discovers the VW has a mind of its own.
No this isn't Herbie before you ask!
Steinfeld does a great job making the audience believe her metal buddy is indeed real and the chemistry between woman and machine is what drives this fun movie.
Action set pieces are nicely staged.
The opening battle on Cybertron looked to be lifted straight from an episode of the cartoon.
It was nice to hear Peter Cullen return as the voice of Optimus Prime.
The special effects had a lifelike texture and interaction between actors and CGI was seamless.
Regarding the rest of the cast.
There's support from John Cena who has little to do and Jorge Lendeborg Jr plays Memo, Charlie's bumbling boyfriend to be.
The list goes on but it is Bumblebee and Steinfeld that carry the show.In terms of audio and visual quality Bumblebee looks great in 4K HDR.
It's not a totally grain free image but this was probably intentional regarding that the movie is set in the 80's.
Colours pop and explosions are blindingly bright.
The sound mix was impressive even from the digital stream that I witnessed.
The Dolby Digital Plus mix has great bass. Stomping robots and gunfire had real thud.
Surround effects are wide and expansive.
Up mixing the sound with DTS Neural X gave great sonic placement up top.
I can only assume the Atmos mix on the Blu-ray will sound even better.Bumblebee was a great movie and I believe it has put an ailing franchise back on track. I would like to see a sequel to this particular storyline as long as Michael Bay stays in the producers chair and not in the directors one.",Bumblebee
127,joelwatchesmovies,"Corny, cool, fun flick",8,24 August 2020,"An endearing, multi-faceted lead (complete with emotional coming-of-age arc--see the big dive--and awkward and sweet summer crush), an unlikely friendship, a simple plot, cheesy alien robots, a charming 80s setting (the many song breaks were great), and classic Americana side characters (cue geeky stepdad named Ron and sniveling younger brother) all add up to a great family movie night movie, equal parts corny and cool and always fun.

My last transformers film I'll watch.",Bumblebee
130,Magow-Intermean,Bumblebee Review,7,15 December 2018,"After years of cinematic scrap heaps, Bumblebee redeems and reinvigorates the Transformers live-action film franchise with some heartfelt fun. It might not be a great movie or a radical reimagination of the familiar concept, but this '80s-set prequel does strip away all the clutter and bloat that had piled onto the series over the last decade and refocuses on the bond between young human and 'bot that it all began with back in 2007.
Much of this refreshing change is due to Travis Knight (Kubo and the Two Strings) stepping in as director after Michael Bay helmed the first five movies. Knight and screenwriter Christina Hodson's story gives its human protagonist, Charlie (Hailee Steinfeld), more depth and more of an arc than either Shia LaBeouf or Mark Wahlberg's protagonists received, which creates more of an opportunity for emotional investment. This emphasis on finding the humanity in the story and providing an actual character arc thankfully extends to its Autobot title character as well.
Bumblebee has an emotional journey here, starting off as basically the robot equivalent of a fearless young soldier at war before going through a sort of lost-puppy phase while on Earth. He can be earnest and vulnerable but also dangerous and formidable. Knight's background in animation certainly helps here as Bumblebee's facial expressions and body language articulate a range of emotions that make it easy to become invested in him and his plight.Thanks to a cleaner stylistic redesign that more closely resembles the original Transformers cartoon characters, each 'bot is more distinctive (especially during the fight scenes) than they sometimes were in the Bay films - you can actually appreciate the transformations here without them devolving into digital blurs of a million moving parts, and you can get an idea at a glance what vehicle a given robot might transform into.
Bumblebee also wisely avoids confusion by narrowing down the number of Transformers shown on screen, largely focusing on just three main ones (Bumblebee and the Decepticons Shatter and Dropkick) while keeping Optimus Prime and others on the sidelines. There's still not much dimension to the Decepticons, mind you, but Angela Bassett brings a distinctly menacing gravitas to her vocal performance as Shatter (the films' first female 'bot baddie).
Bumblebee and Charlie's relationship is at the heart of the story, but each character also gets their own respective arcs and emotional goals. Through her bond with Bumblebee, Charlie confronts the fears and pain she's been struggling with since the loss of her dad, while Bumblebee rediscovers his purpose thanks to the encouragement and guidance he receives from Charlie. Steinfeld's sincere performance grounds the movie, even though her character does have a few too many ""surly teenager"" tropes.
While John Cena gets a few amusing moments as well as Sector 7 Agent Burns, his driven, physically imposing character is a recurring obstacle for Charlie, Bumblebee and their pal Memo (Jorge Lendeborg Jr. as a tacked-on character who is almost literally along for the ride). But Bumblebee even takes the time to give Burns a small character arc here as a soldier confronted with a new kind of foe he doesn't understand.
Bumblebee smartly drops a lot of the convolutions and overly complicated MacGuffins that marked the prior films. This movie doesn't necessarily reject the canon established in the Bay films - it is definitely a prequel to 2007's Transformers - but it also purposefully sidesteps a lot of the history depicted in the first five installments. Did the Transformers still visit ancient Earth at some point before Bumblebee and the two Decepticons arrive in northern California in 1987? Maybe, maybe not. It's left vague. In that way, Bumblebee is a bit of a soft reset for the series, holding onto those elements that worked and ditching the baggage.
Bumblebee is an '80s movie through and through, not just in terms of its period setting but also in its execution, establishing a tone and pace reminiscent of your typical Amblin production of that era and of teen-driven genre flicks like WarGames and Short Circuit. But the '80s callbacks and Easter eggs here are relentless, with nearly every scene including a music cue or a reference. I get it! It's 1987! If Bumblebee was an '80s reference drinking game you'd be dead from alcohol poisoning by the midpoint. While the humor is nowhere near as groan-inducing as it was in the Bay movies, not all the jokes land and comedy just isn't Steinfeld's strong suit. She's far better at the heartfelt and dramatic moments.
Bumblebee is the best live-action Transformers movie since the 2007 film, even though it doesn't quite recapture the wow factor of seeing the robots in disguise come to life that very first time. But it does wisely bring the series back to basics in its character-driven storytelling and simplified approaches to both Transformer designs and visual effects, and by jettisoning the excess and nonsensical storytelling that had come to define the franchise. It was nice to enjoy a Transformers movie again.",Bumblebee

134,jamiedarlow-37510,A brilliantly fun and affectionate film,9,8 March 2020,"Definately the best in the series so far; a prequel to the Transformers films, Cybertron is under attack, the Autobots must find refuge to regather their forces and strike back. Bumblebee takes shelter on earth under disguise. On her 18th birthday, Charlie (Hailee Steinfeld) is struggling to find peace after her father's passing, until she finds Bumblebee. What this instalment gets right that was missing from the previous ones is the depth and affection. There is a genuine care for the characters which although the series so far has had great action spectacle, was missing that element. Here the action also nails it and each blow to any robotic structure is brutal! Hailee Steinfeld is consistently showing herself as one of this generation's best talents and she is perfectly cast here; Charlie is a pretty awesome character with plenty of backstory that is cathartically explored with her new friend. The visual effects department do an incredible job with Bumblebee; the most crucial part is making him appear vulnerable and timid, providing a lot of the laugh out loud comedy scenes and equally the emotional underpinning of the story. The relationship between Bumblebee and Charlie is the greatest and most important part of the film; very relatable and a real tenderness where they truly become family. There's also great performances from John Cena (brilliantly calling out the flaw behind the Decepticons name at one point) and Jorge Hendeborg Jr. as Charlie's friend and admirer. Director Travis Knight (Kubo and The Two Strings), writer Christina Hodgson and the entire crew have lovingly crafted a very fitting family-friendly Transformer film that is funny and heartfelt",Bumblebee
135,Med-Jasta,We don't give a hoot about the humans!,3,16 May 2020,"When in the hell is the studio going to realize this! The worst part about all these movies is tolerating the humans and waiting for Transformer stuff to happen. I don't care about the girl who can't dive anymore because her dad died. Or the guy who's trying to get with the girl.I was really excited to see a non Michael Bay transformers. Just to see what else could be done. Turns out this has the same problems. Bay just goes for it in a huge way. So you get some really bad stuff and some really good stuff. In his movies I could tolerate the bad for the good.But the problem with this movie is that it tries much harder to be a good movie. They focus more on the emotional character story stuff. But it's not directed well enough to pull it off and the writing is terrible. The humor is stupid as well. At least Bay goes into it making a 13 year old boy movie, which he is successful at so while the humor is dumb the action makes up for it.The 80s references made me roll my eyes so many times. What is up with this 80s nostalgic porn that has plagued our movies? If we keep looking back and not forward we aren't going to have our own culture. And nostalgia in 30 years will be indistinguishable from the 80s. When Bumblebee sneaks into the house I thought, ""Here's the ET scene."" And then after the girl comes home there's an open book and guess what page it's opened to? The poster of ET.References are fine but this was done not historically to create a world but for us to point out and say, ""Hey look it's Alf! I remember Alf! This movie is great they're referencing things I grew up with."" The best references are to things that aren't classic today. Not everything that people were into then is classic now. And why wasn't there a Knight Rider reference? Was that too on the nose for this movie?The opening scene was killer and I wished we had more. Prequels like this are such a waste of time. Why do they expect us to be worried that things aren't going to work out? When we know exactly where it's going to end up? At least with Star Wars it was a legitimate backstory made to be watched first.John Cena was terrible. I got the sense that in every single scene he was thinking, ""I'm acting. This is me acting. This is what acting looks like. Don't look in the camera. Don't look in the camera.""And why are movies making fun of themselves lately? Like at the end when he goes to grab her hand and they make this big joke it of it like it's Naked Gun? That's basically breaking the 4th wall and it's been happening a lot. I blame Guardians of the Galaxy for this. I think meta is the word? Everything is self aware and doesn't even take itself seriously, so why should we?We are really in a creative drought of movies and need something new to take us forward. Not back or in the stay in place like we've been.",Bumblebee
136,Puroo,"The whole time Transformers had to fix the HUMANS, not the robots",10,22 August 2021,"Suppose you have to make a movie on Barbie. So, what do we know about her? She's beautiful, she's the symbol of feminine, she goes on adventures. Now suppose if these characteristics were taken and Barbie was turned into a porn film series, how would it feel? Wrong, right? Toys are supposed to be the emotions of children. So they have to be given characteristics and emotions, and not just mash them together and throw in a joke after every two lines. This is exactly the problem with the Transformers franchise, and that's what this movie has fixed.One really good thing about this movie is that unlike many character-driven movies like Sonic the Hedgehog or Cars, Bumblebee has not only ben about his relationship with other people. It is a major plot point, yes, but other than that there's also Cybertron, where the Autobots are fighting a lost cause. So this gives a sense of time constraint to the movie. If it wastes too much time the Decepticons will come on Earth and attack the humans. There are occasional warnings like that guy's pickup truck being smashed.Because of this the humans have been properly intertwined with the consequences. While Bumblebee is spending time with Charlie, he also has to learn the ways in which he must behave if he needs the humans to trust him. Charlie knows about the Cybertron attack but she can't let Bumblebee run in the open otherwise the military will take him away. The military thinks that Bumblebee is a bad guy because the Decepticons told them. There is also Charlie's friend Memo who helps her in the adventure. Overall everyone has an important part to play in this movie. And this is how it should be since the humans are in the movies for the majority of the runtime so they shouldn't be cringy to watch.The only thing this movie was lacking was Michael Bay's action scenes. I'd have preferred if they allowed Bay to stay for the fight scenes, but let Travis Knight do the rest. The action scenes and their choreography were given a nod every time Cybertron was shown. In fact, the movie begins on Cybertron itself. The fight between Bumblebee and Shatter and Dropkick clearly made it seem like how Bumblebee is struggling to keep up with them as the military is also intervening their fight.The character development of not just Bumblebee, but Charlie is also seen in the movie. In all the previous five Transformers movies, there was little to no character development, which is what made us stop caring about them. We already knew Optimus Prime will always be the good guy who will fight everyone and win (remember the Martha scene from the Last Knight where Bumblebee suddenly starts speaking and Optimus suddenly becomes a good guy?) and Megatron will be the generic bad guy. Here we have Bumblebee trying to cope with his new life, Charlie trying to get over her fear, Memo trying to impress her and Agent Burns who learns to trust the aliens.We just need a few more movies like Bumblebee and the Transformers franchise will come back on track. We have seen the character development of one Autobot, now Optimus Prime should be the next one and then possibly Megatron to give his point of view. Finally we have gone over Sam Witwicky and Cade, who had the most one dimensional personalities. Now it's all about Charlie.",Bumblebee
137,shawneofthedead,"Bumblebee is the best Transformers film yet, so full of warmth and character that it will leave you wanting more.",8,7 March 2019,"THE LOW-DOWN: You'd be forgiven for thinking that Bumblebee is yet another shameless cash-grab by the powers-that-be behind the Transformers franchise. There isn't much incentive to improve, after all: money keeps pouring in at the box office (especially in China), even as the films - and scripts - have gotten progressively worse and more nonsensical.
And yet, Bumblebee will have you buzzing with delight. In this blockbuster prequel (reboot?) centred on everyone's favourite sidekick Transformer, everything stale feels fresh again. Most importantly, this film about giant mutating machines has its heart and soul in the right place.THE GOOD: The Transformers franchise takes a page from the hugely successful Marvel playbook, entrusting Bumblebee to a visionary director who's as comfortable with telling a story as creating jaw-dropping visuals. (Apologies to Michael Bay, but explosions do not a movie make.) Travis Knight - who gave us the sublime Kubo And The Two Strings - makes his live-action debut with plenty of heart and flair. He lavishes time and care on the film's emotional beats, grounding it effectively in the tender friendship between Bumblebee and Charlie (Hailee Steinfeld), the mechanically-minded teenager who saves him from a salvage yard. Even with this almost arthouse focus on character development, Knight still delivers no shortage of expertly-choreographed explosions and action sequences.THE NOT-SO-GOOD: Bumblebee's action-packed climactic showdown isn't half as consequential as it wants to be - indeed, it's the least interesting thing about the film by far. And it's not helped by the fact that Charlie and her friends and family seem to be the only humans on the planet worth saving. Jack Burns - played with intermittent charm by John Cena - just barely works as a character, while everyone around him is either forgettably bland or memorably idiotic.THE NOSTALGIC: Fans of the original Transformers cartoon from the 1980s will lap up all the references and re-designs in Bumblebee. When first stranded on Earth, for instance, our titular hero finds refuge in a familiar form: a canary-yellow 1967 Volkswagen Beetle.KNOCKOUT PERFORMANCE: Steinfeld hasn't really managed to find a movie role deserving of the talents she displayed as a young child actor in True Grit (2010) - a performance that nabbed her an Oscar nomination. Who'd have thought that role would come in a Transformers movie? Steinfeld is quite wonderful as Charlie, allowing us to peek beneath her character's tough exterior to see the oceans of hurt and heartbreak she's hiding - from her family and herself. She's remarkably good at playing the hero and the human in Charlie, often at the same time.SCRIPT TEASE: There are a ton of eye-popping special effects in Bumblebee, including a fantastic moment in a tunnel when he shrinks and stretches to protect his human cargo. But the real special effect in Bumblebee is the script by Christina Hodson. By injecting heart and humour into her words and characters, Hodson has helped create the first Transformers film that might actually make you laugh and cry. Unlike later installments in the series, you'll actually root for her characters to live on in the sequels. And, as if all that weren't reason enough to celebrate Hodson's script, Bumblebee manages to be fun, funny and also feminist: establishing Charlie as a person and hero first, before giving her full control over when and whether she'll be anyone's love interest.RECOMMENDED? Surprisingly, unexpectedly, unreservedly - yes. Bumblebee is the best Transformers film yet, so full of warmth and character that it will leave you wanting more.",Bumblebee
138,jayjaycee,Finally a decent adaptation,7,31 December 2020,"""Bumblebee"" is a 2018 science-fiction action film directed by Travis Knight starring Hailee Steinfeld and John Cena.
⚪
All in all, this ""Transformers"" spin off buzzes as mechanically as the titles of its original series, but unlike Michael Bay's bombastic, in quality declining robot epics, this one is a lovely teenage tale in the likes of John Hughes films, and even if the stereotypical features are there and the story is solid yet uninspired and unoriginal, it is an amazing coming of age eighties style flick with a lot of heart, that, for example by Hailee Steinfeld's leading performance, manages to transform into a marvellous adaptation that, while not being perfect, has all the right components and finally does its source material justice.
⚪
After my Christmas break I am returning for my annual final movie of the year, before I will once again go on hiatus. For this special occasion, I thought I I'd watch something not quite sophisticated and decided on a title that has made my inner child curious. I admit it: I grew up with Bay's ""Transformers"" and loved them as a kid, and since it is been ages I have seen them, I cannot really say anything from my today's point of view, but I think they are going to be utterly terrible. That being said, I was a little nervous with this one here. Surprisingly, it was much better than I expected, even though it is still not quite an outstanding achievement. Bay's films were undeniably pretentious, bombastic action epics that convinced with special effects rather than with story or plot, and hence most people disapproved of them, this one however was different. Director Travis Knight stepped away from the manner Bay used to approach this subject matter and did his own thing, and honestly, it works out. In a nutshell, this spin-off is a typical eighties movie that oozes the flair of the decade. From many visual and acoustic references, you get everything and even the film itself makes use of the tropes and stereotypes of the movies it pays homage to. This flick can best be described as ""Sixteen Candles"" meets ""Iron Giant"", as there are many obvious similarities. Years before he was possessed by Sam Witwicky, the titular Autobot belonged to protagonist Charlie, sweetly portrayed by Hailee Steinfeld, a typical teenager with typical problems. After the untimely death of her father, she has difficulties connecting with the family, especially her mother's new boyfriend, and hence she feels alone most of the time. Sounds familiar? Yeah, probably. Anyway, she is the one who finds the wounded Cybertronian soldier B-127 aka Bumblebee, and together they do everything characters in this type of movie do (next to saving earth from becoming the battlefield of an intergalactic war, of course). The thing is, even though it handles its premise anything but terribly, it is no rocket science either. It follows the ""human befriends monster"" formula in a decent but not really bold way. If you have seen one of them before (""E.T."", ""The Iron Giant"" and even ""Lilo & Stitch""), you know what this film is like. Is it horrible, though? Actually, not, because what it lacks in originality, it makes up for with everything else. The visual effects and the design of the Transformers (that now resembles the looks of the cartoon series) is top-notch CGI, and Knight doesn't only use it mindlessly. In the focus are Charlie and Bumblebee, in completely different way outsiders who try to find their direction. Together, they build up an amazing friendship, and as crazy as it sounds, they share a genuine chemistry. Steinfeld (obviously one of my celebrity crushes, so I am kind of biased) plays her character wonderfully and leads the film like no other. Speaking of characters, aside from her, there are no others equally great. Her side-kick/lover Memo isn't only introduced way too rushed but also has no real personality, he is only there to ... well ... to create laughs? I actually don't know. Furthermore, John Cena, when he is visible, felt like the run-of-the-mine soldier antagonist with a personal vendetta you have seen dozens of times before. His acting? Let us not get further into it. The two antagonistic Decepticons are also not better. Yes, they are there to capture the fugitive, but there was nothing special about them. Why exactly them, if Megatron's right arm robot himself, Starscream, was already on earth? All supporting characters are too shallow and could have been fleshed out more. Furthermore, the plot at times felt poorly conceived and relied too much on the genre clichés and felt too comfortable in this domain. It is palpable that the film is aimed at the younger generation, and as a film for twelve-year-olds it works out perfectly, as the overused themes are new to them. For adults and older viewers? Aside from the said factors, it is a nostalgic fun ride nevertheless, and in direct comparison to Bay's attempts to bringing the beloved cartoon series to life, it is a masterpiece. As a whole, I would say that it is a successful adaptation, and I hope they make more of that kind (hoping they will fix the continuity errors by creating an own continuity).",Bumblebee
139,OMTR,Smells Like 1980's Spirit,9,26 July 2019,"Bumblebee is the 'unofficial' sixth installment in the Transformers' franchise and it is actually a spin-off. I bought the DVD before coming back home last week, with the idea that it would be a good family movie, and I was far from being wrong. This is not only a great film to watch with the kids, but also the best episode in the saga. 'Bumblebee' takes us back to the year 1987, and it looks and smells like if it was made in the 1980s with a great cast and an awesome soundtrack. I am listening to it while I am writing this review and I am already looking forward to watching 'Bumblebee 2' in theaters in 2022.",Bumblebee
140,Trevor-Kerensky,A nifty little machine,7,28 April 2019,"After the first five underwhelming TF movies by Michael Bay, this came along. It's like ET meets The Love Bug. A car with a mind of its own crossed with an alien entity. I wasn't sure if this would be better than the Bay films, but it did well at the box office, plus it renewed my faith with Transformers movies. It's even more accurate to the G1 series. I'd never even heard of Hailee Steinfeld until this appeared. But she did very well, and it was good to see a female lead in a sci-fi/action flick. Maybe it'll give Mulan and Rey a run for their money. The California setting also helps, with lots of its places throughout the film. And that soundtrack of 80s pop and rock hits. I haven't heard this much pop and rock music since the first Guardians of the Galaxy film. Considering this takes place in the 1980s, it's good as a period piece.Bottom line: If you were turned off by the Bayformers quintet, this'll help wash that bad taste out of your mouth. If you're not a fan of the 1980s, this may not be the best film. But don't take my word for it.",Bumblebee

It's good, I wouldn't be ashamed to own it, but Hailee Steinfeld is just kind of a boring, odd actress that holds the movie back. It kind of feels like the movie would have been better off told from the POV of John Cena. There was something there.

The exploring the connection and the friendship between a depressed, lonely teenage girl who lost her father and the cute, chirpy Transformer that is Bumblebee is beyond gratifying and puts it on a par with the first Transformers movie with the young and naive Shia LaBoeuf.

144,flicklover,By far the best Transformers film since the first one!!!,9,23 December 2018,"Before seeing Bumblebee, I hadn't really liked most Transformers films since te first one came out in 2007. The sequels ranged from just ok to downright horrible. They were cool to look at but lacked any semblance of true excitement and fun. They were more exhausting than exciting. The films were joyless, no heart, no one to care about. I am so glad that Michael Bay stepped down as director and let someone else get a crack at resurrecting the franchise. The director of Bumblebee is Travis Knight. He has only directed the animated film Kubi before this film but judging from the success of Bumblebee, I'm sure he will get more opportunities.The film takes place in 1987. It starts on Cybertron, where Optimus Prime and the Autobots are at war with the Decepticons. Opti.us realizing that they are losing the war, send B-127 to earth to set up a new base for the Autobots to regroup in. He arrives on earth and lands close to a military team called Sector 7 which are in the forest training. They
immediately go after B-127 but before they can get to him he is attacked by a Decepticon, that tears out his voicebox. Before collapsing, B-127 scans and transforms into a classic VW Beetle. Charlie is a teenager who goes to a scrapyard to get parts for a car she is repairing, but finds the Beetle. She begs her friend that owns the yard to give her the car. He agrees if she could get it to run. In fixing the car, Charlie accidentally activates a homing signal that is transmitted into space and intercepted by Decepticons Shatter and Dropkick. They do to earth to find B-127. They encounter Sector 7 and convince them into thinking that they are peaceful and ask them to help in catching B-127. Meanwhile B-127 reveals himself to Charlie. She befriends him and tries to teach him to communicate with the car radio since he could speak. She names B-127 Bumblebee. A young man named Memo discovers Charlie with Bumblebee but promises not to tell anyone about it. He has a crush on her. Charlie leaves Bumblebee alone in the garage when she goes to work but he is able to get in the house and proceeds to destroy her living room. Charlie's mother angrily blames her for the destruction and she leaves the house with Memo and Bumblebee. They are then attacked by Sector 7 alin with Shatter and Dropkick, Bumblebee is captured. Charlie and Memo go home but they plan to rescue Bumblebee. After finally telling her mother about the pain she is after losing her father, Charlie goes to rescue Bumblebee. On the way her mother and stepfather help her get away from Sector 7 and they find Bumblebee. Shatter and Dropkick nearly kill Bumblebee and reveal that the Decepticons will come t earth to destroy the planet. Charlie is able to revive Bumblebee. Shatter and Dropkick go to a communications tower to signal to Decepticons but Charlie and Bumblebee go to stop them. Charlie is able to deactivate the homing beacon as Bumblebee kills Dropkick. Then Shatter pursues Charlie and Bumblebee causes a flood to kills Shatter. Charlie realizes that Bumblebee has a great importance and tearfully says goodbye. Bumblebee then scans a 1977 Camaro and drives off and meets up with Optimus Prime.This film has as much action as any Transformers film that preceded it, but it also has an engaging relationship between Charlie and Bumblebee. It us really endearing to watch there friendship develop and even when the action gets going you have someone to root for. This film was very satisfying on an action level and story level. The great thing was seeing the old style Transformers in action. In fact the effects though very good are not at all as flashy and intricate as the Michael Bay films, the focus here is more on the characters. That is a change for this franchise, I hope that continues.",Bumblebee
145,rollernerd,Back to life,8,13 July 2021,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**After a small mini break, we are back!!Tonight's movie review is the final entry to the Transformers franchise where we have Bumblebee (2018) an unofficial' sixth instalment/possibly a spin-off. And something else that is different to this flick is that it isn't helmed by Michael Bay!! So straight away, this movie was awesome and the best one in the series - yep it blew me away from the get go till the end. The filmmakers literally took me back to my child hook during the start of the film of the battle on Cybertron between Autobots and Decepticons where the CGI looks awesome - cartoonish but still great and the slow mo robotic voice ""Decepticons...attack..."" nailed it brilliantly. And we also hear Bumblebees voice (same vocal bloke as The Last Knight) and how he lost his voice.Bumblebee takes us back to the year 1987, which is another reason why I loved this film as it looks and smells like if it was made in the 1980s including awesome references to Breakfast Club movie and its iconic tune ""Don't you forget abot me"" plus the Bender fist bump. The props are great such as the Mr T cereal along with a killer 80s soundtrack including Sammy Hagar's ""I Can't Drive 55"", Steve Winwoods ""Higher Love"" and The Smiths ""Bigmouth Strikes Again.""The story is simple and the feel is great, where battle scarred and broken Bumblebee finds refuge in a junkyard in a small California beach town as a beetle. Soon he is found by 'On A Stick' hot dog employee, Charlie Watson, who just turned 18 and is trying to find her place in the world. Once Charlie realises her beetle is more than meets the eye, both characters form a bond similar to a ET like relationship whilst trying to figure out how to keep it a secret from Charlie's family plus defeating the Decepticons.The movie is a refreshing take on a Transformers story that doesn't feel completely chaotic and fast paced while ensuring the humour is perfectly controlled without corny moments. For example, is the junk yard scene where she drives the beetle and waves at the owner at the shop plus the mum driving the beetle with Charlie at chase. Both scenes are funny without having embarrassing awkward moments. The action is truly a spectacle on the big screen and unlike the other flicks, this one doesn't have explosion after explosion every five seconds and no slo mos!!The CGI isn't convoluted while having a story and we have a main character played by Hailee Steinfeld, who heaps of people can relate. Cool throwbacks to previous films including Agent Simmons while we also have The Prototype, Jon Cena who is surprisingly really funny in this movie. Other funny characters include Step-dad Ron's driving skills and the family dog. Overall 8.6/10.",Bumblebee

148,WalkdenEntertainment,Transformers Fans Shall REJOICE!,8,19 April 2019,"Set in the year 1987 (when music was awesome!), a battle occurs on the planet Cybertron, the home planet of the Transformers. The Transformers are forced to retreat from their home planet and split up from one another. One familiar yellow Transformer, Bumblebee, is given a new mission during the battle by his leader, Optimus Prime. Prime tells him to journey to Earth, take refuge and wait to regroup with his fellow Autobots. Bumblebee lands on Earth and quickly gets wounded while defending himself. Bumblebee ends up in a junkyard where he meets an young 18 year old girl named Charlie (Hailee Steinfeld) and together they develop an unforgettable friendship.As the film begins, I was hooked and engaged right from the opening scene. The action, the style and the looks all felt new and fresh for a Transformers film. Transformers fans will be happy to know that this film actually feels more relatable and accurate, especially for those who grew up watching the Transformers cartoon series, played with the toys or even those who loved the animation film from 1986.But these different feelings I have don't just last through the opening sequence- the whole film feels fresh and the story/plot could be considered as either a reboot or a prequel film- that choice is really up to the viewer.Unlike the previous Transformers films which were originally directed by Michael Bay, for this film Bay sits in the seat as the film's Producer and hands Director over to Travis Knight. Knight clearly understands what a Transformer film should be like, in particular the Transformer characters and the cleaner taste of of humour. While I've never published any reviews or scores for the previous Transformers films, I'll say it out loud... I thought the last two Michael Bay Transformers films in particular were absolute poop 💩Our story here is something which many will claim they have seen before (such as ET or The Iron Giant). But thankfully while the film's plot is not unknown, the return of familiar Transformers and new human characters makes it all fun and will hopefully create new feelings in many viewers. Action and home theatre buffs will be extremely content with the audio and visual track here too.I enjoyed Bumblebee and Charlie's friendship throughout the film. Actor and WWE Legend John Cena makes an appearance and he too is fun. Our film also keeps it tight in regards to the number of actors/characters. Even the film's pace and duration felt snappy and fast (Unlike Transformers The Last Knight- again, poop).Overall, this is an excellent Transformers film and I feel like we finally have a Director who understand this franchise and what should be done with it. Even if the audience considers this as a prequel or reboot, there is lots of awesomeness in this installment and honestly, I'm curious to rewatch the the franchise again as this could be my favorite out of the 6 Transformers films. Either way, this film gives me hope for the future of this franchise and I'm sure our Autobots will return.7.8/10

149,williampsamuel,"Bumblebee is the Fun, Nostalgic Take on Transformers That We've Long Needed",8,15 March 2019,"When this movie was announced I was skeptical to say the least. New director aside, how good could a spinoff from one of Hollywood's worst franchises be? Even the trailers didn't entirely convince that this would be anything more than just OK. So, what a surprise when the reviews came out. Bumblebee isn't just a good movie, it's one of the best movies of the Holiday season and by far the best in the Transformers series.It all starts fittingly enough on Cybertron, where the last of the Autobots are fighting a desperate rear-guard action against the Decepticons. From there the action moves to earth, where the giant robot battles immediately pick up again, with the army caught in the fray. Now if this sounds a lot like the previous Transformers movies, it's because it is. But it's very good action that gets things off to a rousing start. And after the initial burst of explosions and CGI, this movie is about so much more than just giant robot battles.At its heart this movie is about the relationship between Bumblebee and his young ""owner"" Charlie, played by the talented Hailee Steinfeld. And on that level Bumblebee is quite funny and surprisingly charming. There are strong shades of Herbie from the Love Bug as Bumblebee acts up, talks back, and generally gets himself into trouble. There's also an unmistakable influence of ET, especially in one of the movie's funniest scenes, in which an unsupervised Bumblebee tries to explore his new house, with disastrous results.This movie works because it has characters that we like and care about. Bumblebee is an adorably friendly and naive fish out of water when he isn't blasting everything in sight. It's impressive how expressive he can be with hand gestures, facial expressions, and snippets of songs on the radio. And it's kind of inspiring to see Charlie come out of her shell and get to know the boy next door. At its best, this movie is as much a coming of age story and John Hughes style teenage romance as a sci-fi blockbuster.Despite the PG-13 rating, this is a movie I would feel comfortable recommending for the whole family. The violence is mostly bloodless and between robots, language is minimal, and the closest thing to sexual content is some buff guys taking their shirts off.Now admittedly this movie can be pretty predictable sometimes. No points for guessing whether Bumblebee will eventually do something heroic that convinces John Cena he's the good guy, or if Charlie's frequently mentioned diving prowess will be put on display. Nor does it have the sheer awesomeness of the best Marvel and Star Wars films. But Bumblebee is what the franchise should have been from the beginning: a fun, heartfelt, occasionally cheesy exercise in nostalgia.",Bumblebee

The movie aalso only focuses on 3 transformers including Bumblebee making the film much more focused and streamlined.Bumblebee had tender character moments and comedic moment that weren't cheap but actually funny. Successfully fleshing out the warmth of Bumblebee's character and making us sympathize with the loveable autobot.Bumblebee truly sets itself apart with the addition of John Cena's agent Burns, aka 'the military guy'.

Thank you Bumblebee, for making this movie even better than Michael Bay films.",Bumblebee
156,asifahsankhan,The Best Transformers Movie Since The Original!,8,21 December 2018,"Bumblebee is the best film in the Transformers franchise since the live action original. It's not a bloated, juvenile, CGI barrage with a hackneyed script and terrible acting. In other words, Michael Bay is not the director. The sixth volume succeeds because the story and characters are well-written, have depth. Bay's dripping machismo is replaced by a more feminine sensibility. Screenwriter Christina Hodson and director Travis Knight breathe fresh air into a stale commodity. Bumblebee rekindles the spirit of the cartoon, while adding an unexpected dose of warmth and humor.Set in 1987, Bumblebee opens with the fall of Cybertron. As the Autobots evacuate the planet, Optimus Prime (Peter Cullen) dispatches B-127 (Dylan O'Brien) to Earth. He is to scout the planet as a possible secret base. The journey does not go smoothly. The Decepticons are one step behind him. His landing observed by a stunned military officer (John Cena).Hailee Steinfeld stars as Charlie, a grease-monkey teenage loner with a tragic past. Her mother (Pamela Adlon) and goofball stepfather (Stephen Schneider) are constant annoyances. On the cusp of her eighteenth birthday, she's stuck in a minimum wage job, riding a clackety scooter to work. She spends her spare time at her uncle's junkyard, scavenging for parts to fix her beloved father's Corvette. Charlie discovers a beaten up, yellow Volkswagen Beetle. Her attempts to fix the car uncovers an amazing new friend. Charlie finds happiness in the gentle robot. But is completely unprepared for the bad-ass Decepticons, Shatter (Angela Bassett) and Dropkick (Justin Theroux), searching for him.Bumblebee can be described as The Breakfast Club meets Transformers. The roaring eighties soundtrack and teenage girl angst is skillfully blended with the robot carnage. Christina Hodson's screenplay respects the characters. Charlie has a lot of personality. Her family and social life are thoroughly explored. Charlie finds Bumblebee at a low point. He's confused and frightened, needs help. They grow together, developing a strong bond in the process. It sounds sappy as hell, but actually works. The previous Transformers films lacked feeling. They were cold, purely visual spectacles. Hodson, who's also writing Birds of Prey and Batgirl, delivers a complex heroine. Hailee Steinfeld, Oscar nominated for True Grit, plays Charlie perfectly. Girl power is the fuel that drives Bumblebee.Travis Knight's experience as an animation director is evident here. Knight previously made the brilliant Kubo and the Two Strings. He understands how to use visual effects to express intent and emotions. Bumblebee says very little in the film. His facial expressions and mannerisms convey meaning. He goes from tender, humorous moments, to knockdown brawls. Bumblebee's smaller stature in comparison to other Transformers is used to his advantage. He has a unique fighting style that beats down larger opponents. Except for the huge opening scene, Bumblebee's fights are mano a mano. I think these are far more effective than CGI onslaughts. Travis Knight brings a vastly different style to Transformers. It's a welcome change that will definitely be embraced by fans.Bumblebee reinvigorates the Transformers franchise. Christina Hodson and Travis knight have broadened its appeal to a wider audience. Paramount Pictures and Hasbro have smartly taken a new approach. I hope they stick to this path for the next installment. There are additional scenes during the credits.",Bumblebee
157,Hallelujah289,"Decent blockbuster: enjoyable, well-made, predictable",7,10 August 2020,"You've probably watched this movie before. Fairly typical ""Iron Giant"" girl meets friendly giant robot story with the canned humor similar to the current Marvel/DC blockbuster age. Pleasant, safe, with the broadest somewhat generic appeal.However despite some of this blandness and long-ish running time ""Bumblebee"" passed by enjoyably, without fuss, and with good, familiar but well loved for a reason story beats. Who doesn't like the meeting moment of the ordinary and the extraordinary? Or the training of something superpowered to behave in the terrestrial world. The acting was solid, particularly by the young lead actress which is always nice to see (presumably) new talent carry a movie and stake their name.There were a few blind spots in the movie which could've been developed further, but for the most part you'll be quite chuffed with the neat-o 80s soundtrack, subdued but still magical cinematography, charismatic fresh faces and overall good execution of this familiar but beloved archetypal coming of age story.Also there's actually a lot of incidental death and destruction in this film if you pay attention.",Bumblebee
158,FelipeCarrillo,The rebirth of a franchise that finds gold in regression,8,3 March 2019,"The ""Transformers"" film series was up to its neck in problems for a very long time; ""The Last Knight"" was the straw that broke the camel's back and suggested, albeit only for a couple of weeks, the steel-made extravagance the fiercest Michael Bay once conceived was off. Critics, in outline, abhorred increasingly each new installment; however, more people exponentially turn up at the movies to strive to understand the superhero-level set-pieces and to elude the heavy-handed, daft, confusing mythology writers and directors made up for every two-hour-plus nonsense on screen with more difficulty and less success. Punishingly overlong, self-indulgent, inflated and uber-pretentious; the numbers, out of the blue, took a nosedive, needless to say, there was no historic underperformer, but against billion-dollar ""Dark of the Moon"" and ""Age of Extinction,"" downfall was close at hand, and it's crystal-clear messing with studios' money is the only way an American major reworks and recasts its shaky structures.Many might say that they're just getting started, but in view of the final result, a stripped-down flick has been the cleverest move. The project of a prequel/spin-off centered on one of its two most emblematic characters came up from out of nowhere. At the same time, as the idea was taking shape by signing director, screenwriter and leading actress up, half the world went bananas trying to predict what kind of film Paramount Pictures was cooking up. I can say with absolute conviction that this is easily the best ""Transformers"" movie to date.Considering those responsible for such remarkable production, you could never picture the dazzling, moving end product. Bay, hated and loved equally, comes back, but just as a producer, which denotes a good, significant step up. An act of redemption by screenwriter Christina Hodson, guilty of shamefully careless screenplays such as ""Unforgettable"" by Denise Di Novi or ""Shut In"" by Farren Blackburn. Director Travis Knight is a wholly different story; nominated twice for the Academy Award for Best Animated Feature for the lyrical stop-motion feats ""Kubo and the Two Strings"" and ""The Boxtrolls."" American singer Hailee Steinfeld has shaped an acting career brimming with victories, with an Oscar nomination for her practically flawless performance as Mattie Ross in Coen Brothers' ""True Grit"" and one Golden Globe for her unique Nadine in ""The Edge of Seventeen,"" my favorite coming of age film- Bo Burnham's highly praised ""Eighth Grade"" is still waiting in my bucket list. - BAFTA nominee Enrique Chediak has been the director of photography of nothing but ""28 Weeks Later"" and ""127 Hours."" Oscar-winner Dario Marianelli has been the composer of sound art pieces and masterpieces such as ""Paddington 2,"" ""Darkest Hour,"" ""Anna Karenina,"" ""Pride & Prejudice"" and ""Atonement."" These are the heterogeneous ingredients of a film that surprises not only for its tonal metamorphosis with respect to its predecessors, but the heart, vigor, and simplicity the film uses to weave its story.""Bumblebee"" is a nostalgia-driven adventure of unsuspected narrative force, focusing on ever-present themes that movies don't get tired of digging into and, why not, mixing up such as friendship, adolescence and growing up with a doubtless 80s flavor, a time the film takes advantage of. Setting it somewhere between the most fantastic John Carpenter, ""Stripes,"" The Smiths and A-ha is the right time to get rid of any dispensable hassle, going back to basics and staying there, it's just Charlie and the 1967 Volkswagen Beetle in a survival race; zero Bayhem.The film takes its time to set up the underpinnings and to present our heroine's dramatic arch, a young woman struggling to come to grips with her father's sudden death. She lives among abandoned vehicles, car relics, and teenager gloom; on her birthday, she ends up acquiring a beat-up, tiny yellow car, a vehicle that becomes her confidant, her bestie. We've already heard this story a thousand times, but let's face it: no one on planet Earth can resist clever, poignant feel-good movies, no matter time, place or mood, this always enjoyable sub-genre will get followers in large part for how easy it is to identify yourself and get along with the characters. Besides, due to Mr. Bay's pyrotechnic filmmaking, it was exciting to imagine such a story starring Bumblebee, in the 80s. The final result couldn't be better. Charlie receives a careful treatment, unfolding her wounds and trying to heal them so honestly that the most dramatic moments are painfully stabbing.Bumblebee receives a dignified narrative background as well: he and his species are being hunted by a pair of Decepticons, which allows displaying the high-sounding, better-handled action sequences with finesse. The funniest, most emotional, tender character-driven moments take place in the first forty-five minutes of footage, a long period where Charlie finds and meets the naïve steel-made creature, where she tries to communicate with, instruct and teach him that the world in which he's stranded isn't a human-sized paradise. The story points at the big finale alongside, via small doses of the trademark complicated, sometimes unintelligible terminology and chronology. The second half of the flick is out-and-out pure spectacle, harmonized by John Cena, Jorge Lendeborg Jr. and their measured yet helpful comedy shots amidst the Herculean battles. Knight ultimately carries out his duties by hooking the audience up and tearing apart their hearts, knowing beforehand that coming-of-age-like sub-genres could not be part of the franchise again.The set-pieces, as opposed to those of its predecessors, like the film itself, are much more restrained and compelling, not so groovy or showy because of a realism beautifully rendered with impressive digital effects that, even without high-resolution IMAX screens, endows action sequences with humanizing character. There is a good lack of predictability threatening to eliminate core characters just mid-story through unexpectedly raw images that kids will struggle to bear, excluding PG-13 carnage, a handful of murders amusingly reduced to plasma. Certain continuity, pace and editing errors should be attributed to editor Paul Rubell, however, as a coherent whole, it is a resonant, overly enjoyable popcorn film that will delight all kinds of audiences, even the devotees of Bay and his exuberant filmmaking style.Technically and artistically speaking, it's excellently made, the camera moves with finesse and puts special focus on the development scenes like this saga had never seen before, holding their feelings and tones and throwing them to the viewer; it's praiseworthy that every scene gets a precise treatment which justifies its place in the footage. The '80s references and easter-eggs are juicy and countless both physically and spiritually, as each frame tries to unfold the life of the protagonist in a time of iconic clothing and hairstyle, female liberation, music history, political riot, and scientific discoveries.""Bumblebee"" by Travis Knight gives life and hope to a franchise in its death throes through Steinfeld's charming, sincere performance, the heart of a script based on friendship and forgiveness, and the emotional narrative control that Travis stamps in all his movies. Without warning, the ""Transformers"" film franchise rises from the ashes, and despite its post-credits scene suggests a risky return formalized by Paramount Pictures' brand-new measures, it's better we rejoice now in the candor and simplicity of a film jam-packed with underlying shrewdness.",Bumblebee
159,grlym-46849,Cute family movie,7,8 February 2019,Fun to see transformers in their original form. Straight forward plot. Simple and enjoyable,Bumblebee
160,gareth-75442,UGH! just should have been better,5,12 April 2020,"Just like all the Transformers movies there are some fun bits smattered in amongst all the garbage.
Movies like this with budgets like this one & budgets that are even bigger like all the Transformer movies are never going to dissapoint when it comes to the visuals, the special effects & Cgi will always be outstanding, the problems will always be the story/plot, some will like them some will hate them, some will just find them MEH!
The cringeworthy pervy over the top ultra violent garbage from Michael Bay has been ditched for a more childish take for the Bumblebee movie, while still keeping with the ""teen saviour"" angle that is thankfully non pervy yet still incredibly boring.
This as with all the Transformer movies is nothing more than eye candy, lacklustre plots & pointless story's make for boring movies, once you've seen the 1st Transformers movie the rest become nothing more than so so, more of the same Cgi doesn't make for a more interesting watch, it would have been far better had they gone along the lines of Toy Story or small soldiers, would've been far far less indiscriminate killing far less cleavage & a hell of a lot more entertaining with the Transformers battling decepticons at toy size dimensions than these ridiculous movies have been.",Bumblebee

162,virindra,Great movie.,8,31 December 2018,"I went to see this movie with my daughter. We both loved it. Before I saw this movie, I read a lot of negative reviews about the acting of John Cena. I really wanted to like this guy as an actor, but really his acting was terrible. Maybe he did not get the right guidance for his role, but maybe he was just a miscast. Thomas Hayden Church would have done a lot different with the same role.When we got to see more transformers on the alien planet, with Optimus Prime, those were the best scenes. What a treat! Seeing the old school transformers in a more realistic way. I explained to my daughter that the autobots (cars) were the good guys and the are in war with the decepticons (airplanes). But then two decepticons came to earth and they changed into cars. She asked how this could be, but I had no answer there.
The main character, this girl, she acts good. But she is the only good performer in this movie. Even bumblebee acted better than John Cena and he's just an animated character. Loved the movie, nice action, jokes, kid throwing up in the car was hilarious.",Bumblebee
163,kevinxirau,Finally the Transformers movie we deserve.,8,30 December 2018,"In 2007, Michael Bay showed the world that today's technology could bring the famed Transformers to life on the big screen. Sadly, he has the finesse of a brick to the face as his subsequent films for the most part are rusted pieces of scrap due to his crude style of filmmaking, lack of focus, and narrow demographic, leaving fans with only the 80s animated movie as the true ""good one"", that is until now.Plot: Charlie Watson (Hailee Steinfeld), a teen girl struggling to move on after her father's untimely death, encounters the fugitive Autobot Bumblebee and the two form a heartfelt bond, which will be tested as they are hunted by both the secretive Sector 7 and a couple of Decepticons.Knight knows what makes a film truly stick with people and that is in the story and how one tells it, something he excels at. He gives his films heart, thus the relationship between Charlie and Bumblebee feels natural. The central focus is this friendship with many scenes that are charming, funny, and hit hard in the feels. Unlike the stuttering and super uptight Sam Witwicky, Charlie has a lot of spunk and pathos. While having a predictable character arc, John Cena did a nice job with his role. I love that this film is not only set in the 80s (when the show came out), but lives and breathes pop cultural references and classic songs from that era (including a great callback to Stan Bush). While Bay's action focuses on huge zany explosion-fests that push believability and heavily involve the human military, here the action is smaller and much more personal, strictly Autobot vs Decepticon as it should be since it was what the franchise was built on. In fact, the portrayal of the Decepticons has improved; not only can I tell them apart this time thanks to their varied designs and color schemes, but they're given more personality and actually live up to their name.The only thing that has me puzzled is the continuity as there's confusion over whether or not this is a reboot or a prequel given some conflicting elements. That being said, this is, in many ways, the Transformers movie I've been itching to see for a long time. I'd like to see more directors present their takes on the franchise and go to places both familiar and new as long as Bay stays out of the directing chair. To sum it up, Bumblebee's got the Touch.",Bumblebee

166,Lewis_Heather787,I'm so confused !,8,17 February 2019,"What did I just watch?? My brain cant properly get around the fact that I watched a ""Transformers"" film that was really good!!!!! To be perfectly honest I missed it at the cinema because I used my common sense and avoided it due to the fact that.........its a ""Transformers"" film. Puts Michael Bay to shame!Im total shock to be perfectly honest because this is what, I think, everyone has been wanting from a ""Transformers"" film from the very beginning. WowTravis Knight has cracked the code that Michael Bay couldn't in 5 whole films, and boy was this film a surprise but more importantly really entertaining. The combination to crack the code of these films from my point of view was simple balance character development and action. Unfortunately Michael Bay didn't see it that way and completely forget about characters and just went for the action. However Knight and screenwriter Christina Hodson have managed to make a film with a script that is funny, enjoyable, action packed and damn entertaining all in under 2 hours. That is pretty good going!!!!Also the cast, even with John Cena, was great across the board!! However obviously there is one standout and that is Hailee Steinfield, already better in one film than Shia Labeouf and Mark Wahlberg combined. She is so good and is a really likeable character, an outsider but someone that you can really gravitate towards and end up routing for. She is just a regular girl with every day problems that you understand and believe. You know I personally hadn't seen much if not anything of her work before.........probably because I'm not its intended audience.......however I will definitely look out for her in the future, just fantastic.I can't believe what I'm about to type.......Overall this film is great and its a Transformers film. The words great and transformers don't usually go together it feels really strange. All in all its 80% out of 100 or 8 out of 10 its a really entertaining film and a really hope they do another film like this again, that time I will be waiting in line to see it with anticipation. Travis Knight, Christina Hodson and Hailee Steinfield take a bow!!!!!!Just watch this film, don't make the mistake I made and just think this is another Michael Bay Transformers film because its not, its a much more grounded, personal and a million times between in every way!!!",Bumblebee
167,solojere,More than Meets the Eye,10,31 March 2021,"Bumblebee is a surprisingly emotional film that, much like its leading Autobot, has more to it than meets the eye. The film follows Bumblebee as he flees to Earth after the fall of Cybertron and is set some 20-years before the original transformers (2007). However, the real start of the show is Charlie Watson (Hailee Steinfeld). We learn that before Shia LaBeouf, there was Charlie Watson. Charlie is a teenager whose whole world seems to be falling apart. When she accidentally stumbles upon Bumblebee, Charlie finds herself confronting not only the loss of her dad but her place in her new family. Simply, put Hailee's performance is magnificent. As someone who struggles with depression, I found her character very relatable. She is funny, heartbreaking, and inspiring all at the same time. Plus, the way in which her character's tragedy of losing her dad overlaps with Bumblebee's losses really strengthens both of these characters. The only real problem I had with this movie was the Decepticons were nothing special. I still don't even know their names, lol. But it is important to remember that this is a character-driven film about a girl and her Autobot. So while it's not the Michel Bay Robot battle royal that the other films are, it may be more important on an emotional level.",Bumblebee

I really liked this movie finally a great Transformers movie with great action and great characters and finally a little heart to the movies.Bumblebee is amazing in this movie looking more like his G1 design and he has some brilliant moments in this movie he's funny and badass.
The human characters are great in this movie as well and I really like how both main characters both feel like outcasts and create a bond through that.The action is fantasic and its nice to finally see what is happening during and action scene unlike the other movies.
The opening scene and the scenes set on Cyberton where amazing and as a fan of Transformers I've wanted to see that for ages.
The design of the Autobots and Decepticons is amazing and looks like old school Transformers.The only problem I have is sometimes the movie feels like a prequel and other times feels like a Reboot and the story can contridict the other movies. However I really hope its setting up a Reboot because this is start of a great Transformers franchise in my opinion.Also I wish they would of shown the old Megatron but we didn't see him maybe next time but would of been great for a fan to see him.Verdict 8.5/10 a great Transformers movie finally great story, great characters and great action.
Finally a transformers movie that to me feels like transformers and hope it starts a great new franchise.",Bumblebee

I don't know what people saw it in, but to me I thought it was bloody awful. The acting is really bad, the emotional scenes fall flat and are either cringy or unworthy, and almost all the jokes don't work. Hey, as it's set in the 80s' let's just add loads of 80s' references and play 80s' music because nostalgia? The first 5 minutes are okay and the CGI is fine I suppose, but after that it just got worse and worse and worse.The military is really stupid, the plot made no sense, the characters all sucked including Bumblebee, the villains were lame, the action is bland, and most surprisingly it was really boring. It's less than 2 hours long but felt like an entire hour longer. I was just waiting for it to end because it was so infuriating! They ripped off The Iron Giant too! I don't even think it's so bad it's good. I could not take this movie seriously at all and nothing resonated with me because it was so dumb!I had high hopes for it after the positive reception it got, but my god I never expected it to be this bad!

In fact, it's the best movie since the original Transformers came out (Michael Bay one, unfortunately) and besides Optimus Prime, Bumblebee was the only other Transformer I knew. Honestly I saw this film mainly for the main chick because she's hot.Anyway, it's the same formula as the other Transformers. Bumblebee disguises himself as a car, main chick (I know her character name is Charlie) finds him in a junk yard and discovers its a robot, they bond, bad guys come. Heck, you even got the scene where Bumblebee explores the house and destroys everything... like E.T.What sets this film apart from the others is that it actually has heart. Hailee Steinfeld was believable in her performance and I hope she keeps getting roles. John Cena is in this movie and he was fun to watch as well. The movie is enjoyable enough for anyone to watch, even my mom liked it.I hope they go this direction with the Transformers movies.

178,MinistryofDoom,A Great 80s Film.....with Transformers!,8,3 February 2019,"Bumblebee brings the Michael Bay Transformers franchise back to basics, eliminating all the fluffy extra stuff that ha been weighing down Transformers films for roughly 10 years. Whether it's a soft reboot, or a prequel to the pre-existing series, we're not quite sure yet and only time will tell, depending of course on the success of this film. However, if the writers were to retcon the series, a'la Days of Future Past, I, for one, would not be disappointed. This is the first film that truly gives die-hard fans what they've always wanted: G1 Transformers on the big screen. That's ""Generation 1"" for those not in the know; as in the colorful blocky style of the Transformers of the 1980s animated series and NOT the grotesque mish-mash of metallic grey mechanical parts in overlapping layers that made the robots nearly indistinguishable in Michael Bay's films. Coincidentally, it's the first film in the series that wasn't directed by Bay. Again: Back to Basics. That seems to be the theme here with Travis Knight's direction style. He's taken the approach of less is more and it pays off big time. There's only one transformer in the lead: Bumblebee, and save for a few cameos and brief background shots, there are only two Decepticon baddies voiced by Angela Bassett and Justin Theroux. That's plenty, I think. Previous films suffered from the razzle dazzle of visual overload using teams of CGI-heavy robots engaging in shaky-camera combat heavy acrobatics over sprawling cities. It was too much to take in, and the visuals were so overblown at the cost of the story-telling. Here, with Bumblebee, Knight is a guy who cut his teeth on animated films like Paranorman, Boxtrolls, and Kubo and the Two Strings. So even though this is his first live action (sorta) film, he's really well versed in creating expressions and mannerisms in a Robot who's literally lost his voice.Make no mistake, this is an 80s film......with robots. As an 80s kid, it hearkens back to the magic and joyful rose-tinted memories of films such as Flight of The Navigator and E.T, and makes plenty of references to the 80s culture we so fondly remember. Every scene is lovingly created to look like it was spliced straight out of the 80s whether it be through the music of The Smiths or Rick Astley, or references to ALF, The Breakfast Club, or Pong...and that's just scratching the surface.Hailee Steinfeld does a wonderful job in the lead as Charlie, delivering heartfelt moments and general counter-culture bad-assery, supported by Jorge Lendeborg Jr. as Memo, the cute but dorky boy next-door, and WWE superstar John Cena whom also does a great job playing up his perception as a muscle-bound tough guy while breaking it up every once in awhile with some funny moments. You're never quite sure whether he's one of the antagonists or not, but he comes across as genuine, honorable, and a straight up class act.I give this an 8 out of 10 for finally giving us a great Transformers film with a great plot, that doesn't rely on an overdose of visual stimulation. Stick around for the end credits to hear a great song by Hailee Steinfeld, whose not only a great actress but also a very talented singer.",Bumblebee

With a good cast (besides john cena) and a look into bumblebees first encounter with the human race is exciting, funny and most of all interesting.cinematography: the movie looks great and has good camera angles and affects obviously for such a big budget.tone: The movie has a very nice new feeling for the franchise being set in the late 1980's, and has a good action scenes as well as comedy bits and the typical teen love story.acting: I loved the performance from Hailee Steinfeld and the relationship with bumblebee and other characters. Although I didn't like John Cena's acting, his limited lines made the movie much better.cons: (if your a big fan) I have heard of this movie having some plot holes. some CGI in the autobots planet looks kinda bad.

186,hoernkeem,"Bumblebee review (2018, Travis Knight) While better than most Transformers movies still only brings this up to average",5,22 April 2021,"In kind of a surprise move instead of getting larger and more bloated this installment of the massive Transformers movie franchise goes for lower key and more intimate and as a result this is probably one of the best Transformers films not that the bar is set very high. The Transformers films have been ridiculous, hyper-inflated atrocities since inception which is a huge disappointment because as a kid I love the cartoon and action figures. In any case 'Bumblebee' scales the story way back. It goes back to the 1980's giving the film some good period nostalgia although that nostalgia never extends to 80's hair. I wonder why that is? It becomes a story about this one, lone tranformer sent ahead to establish a place for the Autobots on Earth. He meets and befriends a loner named Charlie played Hailee Steinfeld. It is interesting how she seems to be pretty glamorous in real life, yet just about every character she portrays is a dorky, lonely nerd type. The plot thickens as a military contingent hunts him and the Decepticons are on his trail as well. John Cena is cast as the primary military guy hunting for him and he is just too over the top channeling his WWE roots for a pretty ridiculous portrayal. I don't wanna oversell this too much. This is not really that good of a movie and it has its issues mainly born of plot simplicity, but it is a watchable, entertaining enough film. This film might only be an average movie, but considering the crap that has been dished out by this franchise average is a colossal step in the right direction.Eric's Grade: C.",Bumblebee

191,anthonyf94,"E. T. and Mean Girls, but with robots",5,31 August 2019,"Being also a prequel (and a retcon), this first spin-off of the Transformers saga can recuperate the atmosphere of discovering and of approaching the alien like in the first movie. The fact that Bumblebee can't talk is useful to build a conception of the meeting between men and Autobots as a real meeting between different species, without the moralistic rhetorical contribution of a more and more stereotypical Optimus Prime. The fact that Bumblebee has to be in some way baptized (here it is explained the origin of his name) reveals maybe for the first time the complexity of this meeting, with men that discovers not just an alien species that use high technology, but a species that concretely is high technology. The questions about technique and personality in relation with it are fecund and interesting.All this good inputs, however, are really badly considered, because, if the film, with these conditions, can explore more deeply the emotional conditions of the Transformers (going finally out from the pure, and blank, explosiveness of the last chapters), it is also done with superficiality and stereotypes. Infact the fact that Bumblebee can't talk is immediately brought on a transformation of the strong robot in a kind of giant dog, with a lot of useless and annoying gags. At the same time the main character lives a standard adolescent life, as a nerd that has to have her revenge on popular guys and has to reconstruct her relationship with parents. So, a copy of E. T. with a copy of Mean Girls with a copy of Herbie with also the now abused robot apocalyptic fight, that make this movie on a side different from the other chapters, but also un-expressive and incapable to say what it, for the initial conditions, could say.",Bumblebee
192,PaxtonMalloy,Old news,5,13 December 2018,"I had the opputunity to watch the premiere in Germany and I was very disappointed with what was presented to me. But lets do it in detail:The Story
Well it is Transformers so naturally the aim is not very high. It is a blockbuster which does't need to have a complex layered story and well it doesn't. We know the pattern, the decepticons want to kill everybody and we have an underdog character that needs to believe in herself in order to help saving the world. It is thin but the character development for the main character is actually pretty ok.The actors
Hailee Steinfeld - She is doing fine, not more not less. It is a little annoying how often she is crying.
Jorge Lendeborg Jr. - This poor guy. He is there as a sidekick to look like an idiot every other minute and give some not so funny lines. It is the character that sucks not the actor.
John Cena - Let's just say he should wrestle as long as he possibly can. Just horrible.The main problem is its goofiness. It is so simplistic in any possible way. During scenes the actors will literally tell you what they do or how it effects their character. The story is basic, the humor very silly. I would say if you are above 12 this movie can give you nothing.",Bumblebee

195,pal05052003,Awesome installment in the Transformers universe,9,30 December 2018,"Bumblebee is a prequel to the Transformers series that manages to fix many of the flaws of the series. First, the human and robot relationships are more meaningful, making us more invested in the characters, and making us feel every blow that Bumblebee his human friend played by Hailee Steinfield. Second, the action is comprehensible. With Michael Bay, you see robots clanging each other but don't know what is happening. In this movie, you know who is fighting whom, and the fights are clear. You actually see cool robot karate and MMA moves. Third, the comedy is not silly. John Torturro, and Shia LeBeouf provided comic relief to the movies but it seemed too silly. In this movie, John Cena's deadpan delivery makes him both humorous and formidable. This is Cena's best role (not like he had any good roles before). Fourth, we still see Optimus Prime. No Transformers movie is complete without Optimus Prime and this is no exception. However, we see enough of him to be satisfied. He is still badass, and commands the screen. But wisely his screen time is enough not to distract the movie from the titular character. So I recommend this movie for all Transformer fans, and moviegoers alike, since it is the best Transformers movie, and one of the best action movies of the year.",Bumblebee

Michael Bay used extremely muddy action sequences where it was hard to understand what the heck you were looking at. It was all about making every shot explosive and filled with CGI and all the rest, but this movie does a great job avoiding that level of muddyness.I would, however, like a Transformers movie with ONLY Transformers, no humans at all.

Well, this movie gives us that.Full of excellent action scenes, great effects and an extremely exceptional and loyal visual adaptation, fantastic sound design and cinematography and Transformers designed with their own characteristics and exciting, finally giving a little life to the robberies. This film is an excellent attempt to demonstrate the capacity and full potential of a well-made Transformers film, however, it falls a little behind with the boring narrative, full of opportunistic moments and clichés, including performances that stay flat on the floor. The script is quite common, with mediocre human characters in a nutshell.

201,mitchell5954,The Best Live Action Transformers Film,7,2 January 2019,"Bumblebee is the latest live action Transformers fil, but this time a spinoff/prequel/reboot. As someone who has long since abandoned this franchise, I will say I enjoyed this film more than I expected. I'll even say this film is fairly solid. It's probably the best live action Transformers film thus far, though that really isn't saying much. This film is by no means great. It certainly isn't worth ninety-four percent on RT. I think critics just compared this to the previous movies. In that context this film looks great, but it's still not the Transformers movie I truly want.The plot is fairly simple. Cybertron has fallen. Now Bumblebee is tasked by Optimus Prime to go to Earth and safeguard it from the Decepticons before the rest of the Autobots get there. When he arrives he's gravely injured by a decepticon, and loses his memory. He's then picked up by Hailee Steinfeld's character. The two then form a close friendship while the decepticons track Bumblebee to Earth.I'm not a massive fan of Transformers. It's been a while since I've really been following any current Transformers property, and I think these films have a lot to do with that. I used to be a big fan. I didn't grow up watching the original Transformers cartoon or movie. However, I did grow up watching the Transformers Armada animated series on Toonami, and I adored that. I collected many of the toys, and even played the videogame based on it. I also watched Transformers Energon and Cybertron, two series that are sequels to Armada, which aren't that great, but are still better than the bayformers movies.When the first Michael Bay Transformers movie came out in 2007 I was ecstatic. To see one of my childhood favorites on the big screen in live action was a dream come true. And I loved the first Transformers when I initially saw it. Even now I still like the film okay, but I acknowledge that it is a dumb movie. Even though Bumblebee is objectively better, I still like the first Transformers movie more from an entertainment standpoint, mainly because of nostalgia, scale, and more Optimus Prime and Megatron.Revenge of the Fallen, on the other hand, was godawful. It's one of the worst films I've ever seen, and easily one of the worst theatrical experiences I'd ever had. Despite that I gave Bay another chance with Dark of the Moon. While that film was an improvement it still wasn't that good. After that I pretty much gave up on the franchise. These movies essentially drained my love for Transformers in general.I have yet to see Age of Extinction or the Last Knight, but I've heard they're not any better. In fact, I heard they're even worse. So, Bumblebee is the first Transformers film I've seen since Dark of the Moon. I can definitely say this is a step in the right direction, but still not the Transformers movie I really want.
The biggest positive of this film is the effects. One of the things that's always been consistently great about these movies are the special effects involved.They look especially good here because the designs of the transformers look more like the original cartoon, which made everything look more colorful.
One issue I had with the transformers in the other movies is that while the Autobots looked colorful and distinct the Decepticons were all grey, making it hard to tell them apart sometimes. Here all the transformers had a unique appearance and personality, which there was also a lack of in the previous movies.The action is also great. Another consistent positive of these has been the action. When the transformers are fighting the action is usually hype. The fight scene on Cybertron in the beginning is especially amazing. I wish that were the entire film.This brings me to my most glaring issue with this film. This is more of a personal thing, but it's been a consistent problem with all of these movies. The film is still very much centered around the human characters, not the transformers. Hailee Steinfeld's characters definitely the lead, and the human drama is more of the focus. It sucks because that stuff really wasn't that interesting.I think Hailee Steinfeld does a good job acting wise, as do the rest of the cast, but the human drama I never found very interesting. You have two annoying parents, and an irritating best friend, just like in the first three movies. You also have the government heavily involved yet again.The only human character I was really enjoying was John Cena of all people. He's an antagonist throughout most of the film, but I found him the most fun to watch. He was funny, and he even said many of the things I was thinking throughout the film.In Transformers Armada, or the original animated movie, the transformers were the main characters. There were human characters, but they took a back seat to the transformers and their story, not the other way around. That's what I want in a Transformers movie that we still haven't gotten yet. The opening segment of this film should have been the entire movie. That's what I want. However, given how poorly this film is doing financially I doubt I'll ever get to see that, which is a shame.Also, much of this movie felt very derivative of other films, mainly the Iron Giant and ET. Another minor nitpick I have is that Megatron is not in this movie. We got to see Optimus but not Megatron? Really? I would've loved to see how he looked in this.Overall, as a movie Bumblebee is good. Not great, but solid. It's still not the Transformers movie I want, but maybe in the future.",Bumblebee

204,jeannefrancoise,It's all about Hailee Steinfeld,10,15 December 2018,"For Hailee Steinfeld fans like me, Bumblebee it's all about Hailee Steinfeld. She is incredible and amazing to play Charlie Watson character in this movie Bumblebee. Charlie Watson character is not easy to be played. She has story lines starting with bullying around her working area, a broken-hearted high jump athlete, insecurities of her life, unorganized romance, and unexpected adventure; those all plots lead to her deep sadness of losing her beloved father and her hate of new father and step-brother. Then Bumblebee comes up to become her very best and trusted friend that could erase her miserable feeling. With Bumblebee, Charlie Watson finds and love herself again and could be more productive and more confident to face the life. While other autorobots coming, of course Charlie Watson defends her bestfriend. I think this is the best Transformers franchise ever made because of many factors; Hailee Steinfeld plays, less CGI, more stories, fun and excited plots, with a very good director. Travis Knight as director could persistently keep the original story of autorobot and how they are moving to earth, by adding some scenes of how human relation could develop dramatically with high robotic system. The choice of setting in 1987 year was so genius because at that time there was still Berlin wall that make situation so tense with anything related to high-technology, especially satellite use. If anything goes wrong with Bumblebee on earth, then America then could judge and blame Russia as trouble-maker, and vice-versa. Charlie Watson as a teenager character is also a huge critic for most millennial generations nowadays who just take part in pragmatism, but never care about the meaning of being loyal. While Charlie knew that Bumblebee is a highly technology artificial intelligence, she protects him, not to sell it to the government. Here we can also consider Charlie as a sudden peace maker with brave and confident decision in a good timing. Then of course John Cena is finally a reputable actor. Well, this Bumblebee movie must win many awards this year and perhaps most of Hailee fans became Transformers fans. Love it!!",Bumblebee
205,Brevin_Campbell,This movie hit me in the perfect way,10,1 January 2019,"Before Edge of Seventeen I didn't know who Hailee Steinfeld was. I had seen her face in music videos and heard her voice in songs, but I had no idea who she was let alone that she was a actress. And yet this year showed us what this little girl could do by being in both this film and in Spider-Verse. And after seeing her in these three films I got to say that I am defiantly a fan of her. Even her cover song ""Bring me back to Life"" was really good. So call me impressed.This film really felt like a Transformers movie even more than any of the other films. The look of the robots is more in tune with the animated series, the way the action is choreographed is visually pleasing to the eye, and the human characters actually have development and feel more realistic that any of the others. It just a far more sweet hearted film. It feels more like a passion project from a fan of the Transformers cartoon who was given a lot of money to make it to its fullest extent. And in that way it really works.There are a lot of really emotional moments within the film. The entire concept of the movie is about a girl and her robot and how she starts to connect with the machine in a more earnest way. Throughout the film you can really tell that there is a sweet bond between these two that I just really loved. And the movie does a really great job of highlighting that.Many critics will say that this movie is to much like E.T or the Iron Giant, but for me I didn't really see a problem with that. To me what made those films work is what makes this film feel just as impactful and it not like we have seen many films take from those in awhile anyway so as long as it didn't feel like a lifeless copy I still found the similarities to work. Because after no matter if those issues were big or small I still was able to emotionally connect with this film and leave out of it feeling nice and happy.Also this film doesn't some big bombastic final act with a light going to the sky like most movies have so that was a big yay for me too.",Bumblebee

210,margulanabutrlov,Bumblebee Review,10,22 March 2019,"Two decades prior to the events of Transformers, Bumblebee (voiced by Dylan O'Brien) crash-lands in 1987 San Francisco. Hauled from a local junkyard by teenager Charlie (Hailee Steinfeld), the intrepid Autobot does his best to adapt to '80s Earth, while evading his Decepticon pursuers.
Everything you need to know about this latest Transformers is contained in a multi-car pile-up. Near the film's finale, a desperate pursuit sees a car hurtle towards a four-way junction. It skids to a stop inches from the bumper of an oncoming lorry, while cars from either side - displaying a keen observation of DMV-regulated stopping distances - screech to a similarly timely halt, leaving both paintwork and insurance premiums intact. It's considered, restrained and genuinely amusing (""I saw this on Miami Vice!"" quips the dad behind the wheel). Total Bayhem, though, it most certainly is not.
After presiding over five orgies of destruction, Michael Bay steps back to a producing role for this plucky prequel, vacating the director's chair for Kubo And The Two Strings' Travis Knight. Where wanton destruction is concerned, Knight is keenly aware that less is more, and while Bay demolished cities with abandon, he carefully rations out the violence to make each blow count.
As every six-year-old at play eventually discovers: mindlessly smashing toys together is never as fun as imbuing them with personality, and in Christina Hodson's playful screenplay we're presented with a robot protagonist brimming with inner life. Knight's experience at Laika comes to the fore here, years of painstaking stop-motion lending an eye for expression as Bee takes in the world around him. Wide-eyed wonder and childlike naivety radiate from a machine stripped of both memory and voice (the reasons for which are finally depicted here). It's a sensibility balanced perfectly by Steinfeld's Charlie, still raw from the death of her father. Bumblebee enters her life when she needs him most and the relationship is believable and touching - an '80s pairing of child and creature that (deliberately) conjures Elliott and E.T.. This partnership is the film's beating heart and draws us in as the pair's bond deepens - she training him like a giant, five-ton puppy and he filling the void left yawning by her loss.
Triple-changer double act Dropkick (Justin Theroux) and Shatter (Angela Bassett) embrace their roles as sneering antagonists, dispatching civilians with insouciant sadism (""I like the way they pop""). But it's John Cena, as walking side of beef Agent Burns, who proves the most flat-out enjoyable, hurling macho epithets as all '80s villains should, while cocking a knowing eyebrow at his uneasy alliance with Bee's hunters: ""They literally call themselves 'Decepticons',"" he deadpans. ""That doesn't set off any red flags?""
From an electrifying prologue depicting the fall of Cybertron (in which we're treated to a rapid-fire line-up of fan favourites, ripped from the cells of the 1984 cartoon), it's clear Knight has a deep-seated affection for Transformers, hitting every nostalgic note with a virtuoso's ear. It's made that much easier by placing the property in its natural habitat, surrounded by clunky Walkmen, Mr T cereal boxes and John Hughes movies, set to a playlist of classic '80s bangers.
In the end, it's not from Bay but rather the movie's other big-name producer that Knight has drawn inspiration. Steven Spielberg's DNA feels baked into Bumblebee, resulting in an '80s movie not just in setting and aesthetic but also sensibility - a high-octane concept Transformed into an Amblin love letter. Knight has served up a gleeful romp with wit, warmth and a whole lot of heart. It's taken six movies to get here, but we finally have a Transformers film that's more than meets the eye.",Bumblebee
211,stephenstephenbyrne,Roll Out,6,6 April 2021,"Surprise surprise the best Transformers movie is also coincidentally the only one that doesn't have Michael Bay's grubby paws all over it.This film isn't a world changer by any means - it's a very simple, cartoony story, but it works in the context of what it is, a Transformers movie.",Bumblebee
212,AliensReservoir,Me too,8,1 May 2019,"He first transformer was very nice, the second already felt and it was the guy from sector 7 who bring it up because he gave laughters, all the others transformers were just bah... clearly exploiting the franchise for money...Bumblebee (this movie) was about heart and this movie did a good job.
It was enjoying to watch, the leading actors were good and overall it was a good movie.So yes in my opinion it's an easy ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ ⭐ /10 + ⭐ to compensate the haters",Bumblebee
213,christophershobris,"Goodbye Bay, Hello Knight",8,6 January 2019,"Every now and then a new director to a franchise can be so refreshing, and no franchise needed that more than the Transformers franchise. This franchise has been beaten down, stomped on, punched in the gut, and spit in its face with bad film after bad film and explosions, more explosions, and unfunny humor, along with some hot girls Michael Bay can jerk off to. This is the Transformer film we all have been waiting for. Finally, our patience and frustration has paid off and we have Travis Knight to thank for finally giving us a good Transformers and saying it's actually good is refreshing in itself. Mind this though, I'm not a diehard Transformers fan by any stretch and even I really enjoyed this film tremendously. However, even though I'm super thrilled with this film, it does lack some originality. It borrows heavily on the whole human befriends otherworldly being story, which we've seen many many times before. It's actually difficult to not compare this to E.T. in many ways. My other slight critique is John Cena. While he wasn't terrible in the role he was given; granted the role wasn't that complex anyway; he never did anything that made me think he's a good actor with some legit potential, he's ok, nothing bad, but nothing special either. His character is weakly written, only there to provide some humorous moments and to appear hardcore, that's all he's there for. Those are my only critiques. I like the family aspect, it does take a different direction then other films with a family involved in a story like this. But the standout of course was the relationship between Hailee Steinfeld's character and Bumblebee. They gave Bumblebee so much emotion with his innocent ways, and clever use of body language despite little to no dialog. Hailee Steinfeld herself do not drag through this uninspired, but gives a complex performance and pulling off both the Bumblebee relationship and the family aspect as well. In the end, I can't believe I can say I just watched a GOOD Transformers film. Did that word just come out of my mouth? Well, it is and if you are a diehard fan, you are in for a delicious treat. And even if you aren't a fan like me, I still would check it out, I really enjoyed this movie a lot. I hope Travis Knight returns for the next installment, just keep Michael Bay's hands away from this a much as possible. Michael Bay has made some good films before, but he botched and wounded the Transformers franchise, now Travis Knight has to rebuild it from the ground up and I think he did a marvelous job doing just that. Not the most original film, but a great starting point for rebuilding. 8/10",Bumblebee
214,ryanwinning1,Finally captured the vibe of the Transformers roots!,8,5 June 2019,"This was my favourite movie of the Transformers franchise so far. I thought both the Autobots and the Decepticons finally had the personalities that were in line with what I watched as a kid on TV with the Transformers and Beasties cartoons. Something about the first few transformers movies I just couldn't follow along with the fight scenes. Although they were really cool movies when Michael Bay directed it I always felt cheated that the action just wasn't right somehow. Like this isn't how Autobots and Decepticons fight!! No way, and it only took 5 movies but they finally got the fighting right in the 6th adaptation. I can't say that watching this movie has transformed me into a huge Hailee Steinfeld fan, all of a sudden, but I am very happy that they finally got the CGI, personality and fight scenes of the transformers right!!",Bumblebee
215,darkwizard404,Just the Transformers film we've all been waiting for,9,25 December 2018,"I decided to give this a watch because I got positive vibes from the trailer although I was doubtful whether it'll turn out to be good or not. To my surprise, it turned out great. It actually had a story that was nicely presented and a concept that was nicely executed.Hailee Steinfield was great in her role. She was able to portray her character very well. She's a total superstar and has a bright future. John Cena was also very impressive in the role he had.Having someone other than Michael Bay as the director turned out great. It all makes sense why the previous films in the franchise were horrible. The action sequences in this one were controlled and very well done. Travis Knight knew what he was doing unlike Micheal Bay, who would just stick to over the top and cheesy action without caring about what the audience wants to see. Aside from that this movie also connects emotionally with its audience. This is something that was unexpected from a Transfomers film. After watching this film, I am 100% sure that Michael Bay was the problem with the previous movies. He should permanently stay away from directing anymore Transformers film.It's no doubt that this is the Transformers film we've all been waiting for. At the end, I left the theatre with a smile on my face. Thanks to the entire team for this wonderful experience.",Bumblebee
216,thisseatofmars,A funny mix of The Iron Giant and E.T. gives us perhaps the best live-action Transformers movie... so far!,7,2 January 2019,"Nothing was cooler than Transformers when I was a kid. I still love robots, in fact, but in spite of this, I'm not one for nostalgia. If a movie or product is bad I will not let sentimentality colour my perception, which seems rare to me nowadays, as people tend to defend their interests at the fanatical level. Don't believe me? Say that a Marvel or Star Wars movie *could* have been better (or that you're not a big fan of the series in general) online and watch as an alarming (and hilarious) level of hostility comes your way. Anyway, it's with a heavy heart that I say that I went into Bumblebee really wanting to really like it, but it's only above average... but you know, average still isn't bad.What sets this Transformers movie apart from the others is the emphasis on story and characters. The other movies were three-hour long explosion fests. Bumblebee instead is slower-paced, taking its time to tell a story about a grieving, outcast girl connecting with a lost creature from another world. The relationship between the two works, and it's sweet: the relationship is not like a friendship between two people but more like one between a person and a cat. Bumblebee can't speak, he huddles into a corner when afraid, and he leans into the girl's hands, which is cute. At this point in the movie, Bumblebee has lost his memory, so neither he nor the girl realize what a powerful soldier he is. We get a taste of this awesome potential when she is threatened late in the movie and he switches into kill mode, with red flashing eyes. It made me think of the ""You are not a gun"" scene from The Iron Giant: but the scene does not carry the gravitas or spectacle that it could have.What's missing is the spectacle of the other Transformer movies. I forget which Transformer movie it is now, but there was one film that featured the Constructicon robots merging together to form a titanic Deception called Devastator. That knocked my socks off when I saw it, years ago, in theatres: no matter how bored or annoying you find the other Transformer movies, Devastator's transformation into a metal titan was impressive. Bumblebee unfortunately features nothing really like that in this film. The closest we get to that level of spectacle are the scenes of Cybertron, with the war raging, but those are fleeting and over too soon.However these Cyberton scenes give us some fantastic the cameos. It was a treat seeing Soundwave, Shockwave, Starscream, and Thundercracker on the big screen, in their proper, G1 forms: and Soundwave spoke in his vocoder voice: joy, joy, joy (I really am not one for nostalgia, honest, but hearing Soundwave speak in his real voice made me smile). I wish we could have seen more of the G1 Transformers on screen.The CGI is as cool as always; watching the Transformers transform is always a delight; but during climactic fights that characters move / animate so quickly it's hard to keep up with what's happening. And, the entire movie has kind of a slow build. There's a whole subplot featuring some ""mean girls"" that could have been cut out entirely, helping with the pacing of the film.But whatever. This is still the best live-action Transformer movie to date. It's not average, it's *above* average, and I hope we see future Transformer movies made in the same vein. More G1 robots, please, more Soundwave and his cool voice, more humans in wonder, please, please, please. Filmmakers of Allspark Entertainment, here is a homework assignment for you: watch and re-watch Pacific Rim for that sense of wonder.",Bumblebee
217,amarshoaib,Took me by surprise,7,11 August 2020,"I originally avoided this movie because I've been tricked several times before, but it was totally worth it.

218,hotrobinproductions,Bumblebee sticks with its magical charm of honey,7,17 April 2019,"I don't get the 6.9 rating I really don't. This is what a franchise that has been bloated with CGI fest bullshit being turned around for a change to make actual quality films looks like. I see people complaining that it focuses on the girl too much, others complaining it's predictable or the plot isn't the best. I feel as if we have seen plots like this plenty of times before, it all depends on the approach and what makes the film stick. And bumblebee has enough honey to make the film stick. The plot, although feels as if it's something we've seen before and somewhat formulaic especially BIG TIME iron giant vibes, it still has much more to offer than pretty much anything transformers films have ever brought us. The script is very crispy and gives us a unique insight to the characters in the film. The performance by everyone is also pretty much worthy for points as well. This film is magical and definitely has my heart. I really want the transformers films to continue in this path. At least this film has a character not as half ass written as Sam witwickity from the first ones. This film isn't afraid to embrace the weirdness of a connection a robot can have with the impact of this young woman. And it's moments like that, that really give this film the magical charm it has. It's a powerful emotional film. It may be predictable, but that never means it's bad, not the slightest. This film uses that to create a fresh and new take on the transformers films that were more than desperately needed.Acting 10/10
Special Effects 10/10
Plot 8/10
Script 10/10
Screenplay 10/10
Performance 10/10
Cinematography 10/10Overall, Bumblebee stuck together a beautifully well made crafted sweet delicacy like honey, it is such an amazing film and it's sad because I think this film was very overshadowed by the competition and is one reason why it didn't make so much money. Aquaman, into the spiderverse, Mary Poppins, Bohemian Rhapsody, the mule. It made the weakest amount of money than even the worst critical response transformers film. But here's the thing. It still made a lot of money, even with all the competition at stake it did. I hope the studio accepts quality over quantity. 9/10 film",Bumblebee

Having never seen a Transformer movie I wasn't sure - but went. I really liked this movie with other reasons than the animation. The main character is a girl who is struggling with the death of her father, and more so since the rest of her family has apparently gone on with their lives. This representation of the events that lead to her feelings are well presented.
Throw in the other aspects of the Transformer dealing with how he will protect the earth - well done.",Bumblebee

221,Eclectic-Boogaloo,It's shocking,7,26 December 2018,"To finally see a really well written Transformers movie. Bumblebee's script, written by Christina Hodson-an endearing lead performance by Hailee Steinfeld-and a healthy dose of eighties and G1 Transformers nostalgia made it quite enjoyable.The only drawbacks to Bumblebee are that not all the emotional beats landed with me, but that may be cause I'm a guy, not a teenaged girl, and that it's much lower in scale and epic action than the Bay movies (no need for IMAX or 3D) but the action is well choreographed and shot.For the sake of comparisons I'd rank Bumblebee a close second to the original Transformers O7' as the best of the live-action movies (third overall behind the first Bayformers and the original animated movie).",Bumblebee

But let's be kind and give applause to a female lead movie, moreover the autobot CGI fighting is smooth, at least they fight for reasons, unlike the chaos transformer 5. Lastly, the memory-lost bumblebee is cute, it melts my heart when he winks his blue digital eyes, it reminds me the Wall-E.

225,Phil_M_A_Kerr,"Set in the 80's, felt like an 80's movie. In a good way.",10,21 December 2018,"It is a fun teen adventure movie. Just what the doctor ordered for this time of year.
Not only was it set in the 80's but the tone of the movie was a throwback to films of the era. There were bits of E.T. - The Extra Terrestrial, The Goonies, Ferris Bueller's Day Off, The Navigator, heck I'll even throw in Mannequin, The Karate Kid, in fact EVERY teen movie made in the 80's. It just had that vibe.
The lead actress has definitely got the chops for this part and Bumblebee was great as well. I can't imagine the effort that went into building such a talented robot actor. A.I. has advanced so much these days. And it transformed into a car on several occasions as well! Very cool.
; )
All top notch blockbuster effects and camera work.
John Cena was reigned in a bit but it was definitely a teen's show so I shouldn't have expected the type of gags he's done in previous films.
The younger boys in the cinema were restless toward the end judging by the few laps they did of the central seating area. Reminded me of the 80's when being part of a cinema audience was a very dynamic thing. I thought it was fun but wondered if the bountiful action in the film got them riled up but they perhaps didn't feel vested in the main character enough to be glued to the screen. Can't say for sure of course. I digress.
Hayley Steinfeld does her green screen acting with the enthusiasm of someone with a great imagination and this means so much to make a SFX film work. It is the enthusiasm that I remember from the original Star Wars trilogy from new actors Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher. Since those films far too many actors have been too cool for school to ham it up for the green screen, ball-on-a-stick, or dorky looking actor in a motion-capture suit. Well done.
It's not a kids' franchise made into a movie for adults, thankfully. It's a movie about robots that turn into cars and/or jets, and panthers and/or ... giant ... cassette tapes ... . The point is that you're not meant to think about that stuff too much!
The audience is there for the fun, the escapism, and a reflection on personal growth. These are some of the things that cinema is designed to provide. Mission accomplished here.",Bumblebee
226,umimelectric,Super lame- not a film for adult humans,2,20 March 2019,"Had to turn this one off before the halfway mark- good thing they didn't get my money. A routine popcorn flick that may impress simple, young minds but leave most mature viewers feeling flat and checking the time. In my short span of viewing, I saw an ungrateful angsty teen character; a blossoming politically correct mixed race relationship; the ""cool kids"" poking fun at the clumsy protagonist having an embarrassing day in her dorky work uniform; and an exaggerated, white Republican man being PG-13 murdered as comic relief. My sympathies go to anyone who paid to see this, and didn't use their parents' allowance.",Bumblebee
227,spmact,I almost loved this movie,7,6 January 2019,"As someone who grew up watching the Transformers cartoon, I loved the fact that this movie was an homage to that show and to the 80s era in which it aired. There are so many references to the 80s and to the show as well. I was also really glad to see the Transformers' forms be much closer to the show than the recent movies.I loved the first Michael Bay Transformers movie, but it was all downhill after that I didn't have high expectations for this one. I was pleasantly surprised though. The characters are well handled, and Stanfield does a really good job, and even as a male I could relate with her and it didn't feel like some PC ""girl power"" addition being forced into the story.I would have rated this an 8.5/10, but the writing at the end was really disappointing. From the Decepticons forgetting the fact that they have guns and other convenient elements that let the good guys win, to the shoehorned in move for Charlie off the tower, it just seemed lazy.The scene with Bumblebee encouraging Charlie with a song on the cliff automatically gets an additional 0.5 stars though, making this a 7.5/10.If they continue this thread with Knight directing, I'd be interested. He seems to have a love for the source material and doesn't just see this as a pay day.",Bumblebee

229,aji4u4ever,WORTH IT,8,21 December 2018,"Though not a fan of transformers, started watching with low expectations but got surprised that this will be the best in the franchise. A spin-off tale or a prequel of transformers, bumblebee concentrates on the affection, friendship and love with Charlie a troubled teenage girl and the autobot ""bumble bee"". Bumblebee flies on a strong story & fast paced screenplay (just like ET) amazing graphics and over the top action sequences. Rather from the other Transformers, this offers emotions The major advantage of Bumblebee is that the premise is set in the late 80s and the classic look of Beetle as Bumblebee. Bumblebee is very cute and lovable and the movie offers more goosebumps moves. The background score will take you back to the 80s movies. Travis Knight (Kubo and the Two Strings) did a wonderful job with his direction. Hailie Steinfeld, the center character puts out an excellent performance and she delivers in style.All in whole Bumblebee is a good entertainer.

230,hiraishinnojutsu,"Good as a reboot, nonsensical as a spin-off",8,21 December 2018,"Thanks to all Michael Bay had done in his effort on ruining this beloved 80' franchise into live action piece of crap, Travis Knight has decided (wisely) to reboot the entire thing, starting with this light-hearted instalment for all ages to enjoy. as a spin-off, it doesn't felt like it's connected to the Bay-verse Transformers since a tons of inconsistencies can be found easily even when you don't even have to focus so much, but hey, it works an fits really well were it officially considered by the studio as reboot (like Hollywood did and will be doing to many of its well-received franchises because, you know, *whispers* money). This is one of so few reboots that actually works: the 80's setting (the time where Transformers were booming), the nostalgic design, a deep message about the true meaning of family and familial relationship, how to deal with loss (and bullies, god I hate bullies) and so on, the very matters the previous movies doesn't seem to handle correctly (or even absent). So far it's a good movie to end the year with, like the 2017's Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle, it's a movie where everyone can have a good and loud laugh together.",Bumblebee

Combining 80's throwback family adventure with inspiration from The Iron Giant, *every* character gets fleshed out, every action scene bears arresting choreography with easy to follow cinematography. Truly captures what nostalgia is really about. Bee's voiceless emoting beautifully comes across as well, no doubt thanks to Travis Knight's experience in animation. If your nostalgia was your memory of G1 toys, and Bay was the worst of Armada trilogy's toy failures, this film is playing with Generations for the first time.",Bumblebee
236,Wirxaw,They've come a full circle.,2,3 April 2019,"I'm shocked by this movie. I expected to see many things, but it wasn't one of them. And that so right that it is so, sooo wrong.To begin with, this is probably the best reboot I've seen, those Spider-man garbages should take note. If Marvel took what made superheroes... super, and twisted it into highest bidding propaganda, then Transformers have actually gone the other way - from Bay's rather... specific style to a ""very"" lore-friendly design. Unfortunately... it came at a cost. A cost of everything.If I had to rate this movie as a motion picture for 5-and-below year olds, you know, the age I was when such kinds of cartoons were interesting - yes, I'd wholeheartedly and with no regrets give this movie 8\10. It misses something that would make it stand out, and I'll touch more on that later, but for the smooth modern ray-traced animation, the much more comic-rooted design, the more ""canon"" origins story - this movie definitely deserves praise. True Transformers fans would probably love it and they have all the right for it, that I will not dispute. Plus... I'll admit that the main actress has some promise in her. She isn't Megan in looks, but I'd say she has even more character. And she is definitely a huge step up from those girls from the last 2 Transformer movies.However, this is where the good part ends, and there's so much left, so much of what probably wouldn't be welcomed by Transformer fans, so if you ignored the rating and so far liked the review - just go and watch it. If you are a fan, you won't be disappointed. I understand fandom, there are movies I wish would have Bumblebee's treatment, even for the worse. But I can't ignore the other aspects and I have to explain 2\10 rating, something I give only to the worst movies imaginable, because 1\10 is literally only good for ""just cause"" rating, same as 10\10.So why is this movie so bad? Bias. Bias would be the shortest answer. After a generation of Bay movies, people, me included, are sort of indoctrinated. And... just like the fans of Star Wars or Terminator don't want to ""kill the past if they had to"", so would I prefer Bay to this. Yes, I've said it. The longer answer would be that ""everything in life is learned in perspective"". To any normal movie - Bay's transformers were... an abomination. A huge joke. He was praised, hated and paid for it. But... Bay had a touch, and he formed an art style that sold. And even if his Transformers got from actually great beginnings to something I wouldn't even write a review of... I now see what he was trying to achieve. He was trying to turn something as painfully stupid and senseless as Transformers into a wide-swallowable product. Not unlike Spider-man, for example. Or Superman. All 3 franchises are probably liked only by people with either very bad fantasy or very damaged brains(fans, I warned you, you should've stopped reading and gone watching). And yet Bay managed to make something that stupid into some kind of acquired taste cuisine, like Godzilla.I honestly thought that The Last Knight would be the worst. Seriously, you couldn't make a worse movie. And it seems like the shareholders agreed. Bay's franchise has come to an end. But what replaced it both has potential, as I've previously said, and is a complete disaster that probably would disenfranchise a lot of people, again, me included. You see, Bay's movies had some... some beef in them. Some kind of meat. It was coarse, undercooked, not spiced. But... they were still movies. And somehow the CGI was better. Bumblebee... is not a movie. It's literally a comic book. It has no plot, no structure. No surprises, not developments. It's... like a slideshow. Youtube trailers have more depth to them. Every scene is a blatant exposition. 9\10 of scenes are cringeworthy, and that's a record-setting stunt, I think as cringey as Sir Anthony Hopkins struggles were in The Last Knight... That there was Sir Hopkins. I shudder trying to remember the ""last"" worst Transformer movie and still... Sir Hopkins. It had Sir Hopkins. And some English scenery. Like a little cream on top of a rotten cake - that much was already welcome.Bumblebee has nothing. Absolutely. Nothing memorable. Nothing outstanding. Nothing noteworthy. Cliche and predictable don't even begin to describe it, they are basically compliments that better movies get. Every character is not even two-dimensional, it's more like... a stroke. And these strokes make Bumblebee an example of modern art. You know, not contemporary art, but the term for things that people currently treat as art, because quality got boring. Not unlike music, that is. These strokes of characters make Bumblebee into this kind of toddler painting that sells in museums for big moolah. Or, in this case, on big screens. But bad characters aren't the end. There is also some disastrous pacing. Do you know one of the things Bay was blamed for? His movies were PG-13 rated, you know, for wussies. No blood, no deaths, no violence. Explosions, yes, carnage, yes, but nothing even remotely ""dangerous for a child"". Well, Bumblebee probably has the biggest killing spree among all the Transformers. People are killed for fun, property is damaged for fun. And I don't mean it in ""Man of Steel ruined the Metropolis"", I mean actual property damage on purpose. Like some kind of gag-comedy, TV-style. Emotions, actions are all delivered from a perspective of mentally-unstable teenager. You know, after Shia's incoherent babbling from Dark Side of the Moon, you'd think yourself prepared. Wrong. You get the most cringe-worthy teenager there is. Daddy issues? Check. Uncaring mother? Check. Step-father? Check. Poor? Check. ""Unattractive""? Check. Yet somehow she is a skilled mechanic, has a job, a home, a family and, you know, these are things some ""actually poor"" people would... quite literally kill for. Somehow all these ""poor teenagers"" in Hollywood stories miss that. So obviously a tiny confidence boost of a robot is all that it takes for this girl to ... well, nothing. Nothing happened. She just got out of depression. I thought Megan's stretching over a car was bad, but damn, Bay nailed that scene. And Shia was a cringefest of a teenager, but boy did he have spirit. Say what you want, but he's a bloody actor alright. The Bumblebee girl, however, does only a passable amount of acting and doesn't really save a plot that can't be called a plot in the first place. Add some of the most gruesome robot slaughter in all of Transformers... which ends in petty WWE-styled wresting. Because when it doesn't matter - you can gooify humans, that's not murder, you can slide robots apart - they are secondary. But when it matters - your main heroes will be virtually invulnerable. You know, even old Transformers took damage.So, at the end, you feel like Transformers are finally getting some redemption. Some hope. Their comic roots will be brought up to the big screen, a new generation of audience would be indoctrinated. Not bad, right? Well... Just like our generation would go back to watch some Iron Man, Star Wars 1-6, Terminator, old Spider-man... movies that had both the artistic direction, the brilliant actors, the plot, the director's touch... Yes, even Transformers. Even Bay... And it's sad that another franchise dies. I mean, yes, it's reborn, but that means it had to die. Because I don't want to be a part of it anymore. I can see how the sequels will be perfect comics, but how they will also be as bland as your first boiled bowl of rice. Maybe somewhere someday there will be a perfect mixture of core material that Bay's franchise lacked, and, at the same time, some special action, some spirit that this reboot utterly lacks. After all, the more it sells, the more it reboots. See you next decade, I guess.",Bumblebee

The story are great with nice comedy and such, but I am still thinking this film is merely a Free Willy with autobot as the whale. Many praise this film, including my Mother, but that's fine.

243,rustonreviews,Teen angst and robots.,8,13 January 2019,"I was never a Transformers fan growing up. I vaguely remember watching The Transformers: The Movie (1986) as a kid and being relatively unimpressed by it, and that was as far as my exposure to Transformers went until Michael Bay's relentlessly fun Transformers was released in 2007. With Bay's film, I was finally on board with the whole Transformers craze, although that craze was relatively short lived. Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen (2009) was a disaster of a sequel, and Transformers: Dark of the Moon (2011) was just as terrible. Transformers: Age of Extinction (2014) was my final straw with the franchise, but by this point I was hating myself considerably more than the actual films as I was continuing to give them the benefit of the doubt. I skipped 2017's Transformers: The Last Knight and the announcement of a Bumblebee spin-off had me sighing at the fact that these movies were just never going to go away. And then they announced Travis Knight (director of 2016's brilliant Kubo and the Two Strings) would be taking over the reins from Bay, and suddenly it seemed like the beaten, dying franchise had founds its new hope.Bumblebee (mercifully) takes things back to basics. In 1987, Bumblebee crash lands in California after narrowly escaping a war torn Cybertron. Teenager Charlie Watson (Steinfeld) is still grieving the death of her father and is unaccepting of her mothers remarrying so soon after. She finds Bumblebee in a scrapyard where she works and is thrilled to receive the battered beetle as an 18th birthday present, unsuspecting on his Autobot origins. Not too long after, two Decepticon's arrive on Earth in search of Bumblebee after tracking his signal accidently transmitted by Charlie. As Bumblebee becomes hunted by both Decepticon's and Sector 7 (a secret government agency who Colonel Jack Burns (Cena) works for), Charlie works to find a way to keep his arrival on Earth a secret, unaware of a greater battle on the horizon.With Travis Knight at the helm, Bumblebee is the surprise Transformers film nobody knew they wanted. Opening with a spectacular action sequence on Cybertron, long term fans of the Transformers will be thrilled to witness Optimus Prime (in an effective but minimal role) and co. redesigned as they were in the original cartoons. It's a great introduction to the film and is unapologetic fan service, but with legitimate purpose to accompany it. A noticeable change is how the action sequences are handled. Previously, Bay composed action sequences in such a chaotic manner that you could never tell what was actually happening or who was hitting what. Knight shoots his action sequences on a wider scale: they're less frantic and expertly executed, but most of all, they're fun and not at all as likely to give you a headache (something all of Bay's sequels managed to accomplish). Gone too is the leery nature of Bay's camerawork, which is more than a welcome change.At the heart of the film is the bond between Charlie and Bumblebee. Charlie is a likeable, well developed character and the friendship she strikes with Bumblebee feels wholly genuine, and many of the films stand-out moments are not the action sequences (although they are pretty great too), but it is instead the quieter, more character driven moments between the two of them that steal the show so effortlessly. In that respect, it is very similar film to The Iron Giant (1999), and even goes so far as to riff a scene directly from that film.Bumblebee is without a doubt the best Transformers film to date. Although that isn't saying much given the franchises track record, Knight (with Hodson's terrific script) crafts a genuinely fun film that packs exciting action and (in the biggest plot twist of the franchise) genuine emotion. Who would have ever thought it?",Bumblebee

247,Rat_27,Please make it stop. I want off.,2,25 December 2018,"This movie was terrible, awful and bad on so very many levels. I gave it plus 1 star for the soundtrack. I grew up in the 80's, so I liked the music choices, and I laughed at the music rejections. I have no intention of ever watching this crap again. I see the headline review give it 10 stars, and call it the ""best transformers movie ever"". I could not possibly disagree more. It is not only a bad Transformers movie, but it is a bad movie as well. The effects were all right, but that isn't nearly enough to carry a film.I know it's becoming common-place, but I hate movies that depict every male as weak or evil. The main male in the movie is John Cena, and you can tell that he is a bad guy from the trailer. as she says the word ""terrible"", he is shown for the first time. The love interest is portrayed as a geeky dude who has a crush on her, and part of the comedy of the movie is her shooting him down. He is a very weak and ineffectual character. Her little brother is an annoying little brother, and her step-dad is flawed because he smiles too much. There are two random characters in the middle of the movie, and they depict the male of the couple as an insufferable ass, and of course ... he is killed, while his girlfriend is spared (for absolutely no reason).It felt like I was watching an 80's movie (which was referenced more than once during the movie), but the scenes were forced. For instance, at the beach party scene (central to most teen movies from the 80's), our heroine is given the opportunity to be one of the cool kids. It involved cliff jumping, which she should be good at, because she was on the school dive team? ... No idea why that would the case, but she wasn't wearing a bathing suit. So, when she backed down from the challenge, the common-sense response would simply be ... ""I'm wearing jeans, and am not about to jump into the ocean."" Instead, they make it a big scene of her losing face, and feeling bad. Then, there is a chance for the mean, hot girl to come up and be mean to her. Keep in mind that this is a beach party (on a cliff. whatever), and the mean, hot girl is wearing a skin-tight dress and heels. Sure. Why not? They NEVER come back to this part. This movie might be awesome if you are an 18-year old girl, but I am not, so I thought it sucked. Oh yeah, it was her birthday, and no one really cared. Does that sound familiar?Later on, Bumblebee takes Charlie with him to go stop the bad guys from sending the message. I was wondering why he brought her at all, since she couldn't help. He stuffs her in a garbage bin to keep her safe. But ... why did he even bring her in the first place. He should have left her miles away, but ... the plot needed it. Lots of things happen to convenience the plot, so it makes me think that the author is ... not good. Bumblebee kills a Decepticon with a missile, but a missile hits the dumpster that Charlie is hiding in, and she is fine. Maybe that's why he hid her in there ... it was magic, or something. There is a point where Charlie tells Cena that the Autobot is ""more human than you!"" ... wat? That isn't even rationally possible. Again, might make sense to an angry teenage girl when people forget her birthday, but I am not in that demographic.The writing was terrible, the character interaction was poor, and the plot was color by numbers. I will never watch this movie again, and I will likely skip anything written by Christina Hodson .",Bumblebee

249,alexqueens,Beautiful nostalgia brought to life,7,30 October 2019,"Finally, a Transformers movie done right.
This is exactly what the 80's kid in me would have wished for in terms of a live-action Transformers movie.
Where Bay's version was to re-imagine the Transformers as scary-looking alien machines, Knight's version (or whoever's idea it was) has created the most ideal version of our beloved 'Robots in Disguise'.So glad that Bay was only attached as a producer only.
Though I wish this was a reboot to kickstart the franchise in a new direction, following in the style of Bumblebee.
For this is the perfect example of making a predictable and cliché movie that everyone can be proud of.
Setting it in the late 80's with a killer 80's soundtrack certainly doesn't hurt either. The nostalgia is strong in this one.And I kept saying to myself how this resembled an early Spielberg movie in story and feel, only to realise later that Spielberg was actually involved as an executive producer. I can't help but think that his stamp was all over this (even if he wasn't directly involved, his aura must have surely set the tone for those actively involved).",Bumblebee

251,Lost_In_Translation_,What the Transformers series should have been from the start,8,29 January 2019,"I've only seen the first Transformers from Michael Bay. At the time it was amazing and mind-blowing. That was over 10 years ago when I was just a high school kid who would be easily impressed with the CGI. I've watched it once since then, and I realized it was kind of just somewhere between okay and trash.I never saw the 4 movies that happened after it, but I saw snippets and absorbed some of them due to the fact that I worked at a movie theater. I had zero interest in them at all. Sure the CGI and action was good looking, but the characters and story were never anything worth me watching it. Also as good looking as the action was, it wasn't very interesting.So when I saw a long time Laika studios director was helming this, I was interested. Luckily he did a damn good job in making a movie that is actually watchable and enjoyable. I won't go saying this is a new modern classic or on the level of the best Marvel movies, but it is a really fun and heartfelt movie that revolved around robots who turn into vehicles.The characters are finally given more depth than any previous movie and are the crux of what makes this movie so good. Charlie is an extremely likable teenager who is somewhat of an outcast trying to find where she belongs.The movie's plot and pacing feels like it is something straight out of the 80's. Girl befriends alien, government chases after them, teen girl finds herself through the journey. It's similar to E.T., The Goonies, or most other 80's teen adventure movies.It's just a damn blast to watch and I enjoyed every second of it. It's a simple well made action movie that doesn't bore you to death like the previous TF movies.It's a shame that it's not doing huge at the box office. I'm guessing since Marky Mark's 2nd Transformers came out last year that the general movie-going audience was feeling some fatigue. Also Aquaman was a surprise hit out the same day.I do hope they make more with this tone in mind from directors who do more than just mindless action!",Bumblebee
252,Ingrouille181,Better than the four Transformers sequels,7,16 December 2018,"The only Transformers movie I've liked so far was the first one; maybe my 11 year old self was too fascinated by all the effects and battle scenes to think critically about the plot or the directing but it was already too late: the first Transformers will always stick with me, and it'll always be one of my favourite action movies. Now we have Bumblebee, a movie I was actually wanting to be made since I saw the first movie; I wanted to know why his voice was missing, I wanted to know how long he'd been on Earth and what led up to him meeting Sam Witwicky.The film follows the fall of Cybertron, set in the 1980's, and Bumblebee, a lieutenant of Optimus Prime, is sent to Earth to await his leaders arrival and to keep the planet safe. Meanwhile, a hotheaded girl named Charlie is coming of age and is looking for a car, eventually coming across a wounded Bumblebee. The two quickly become friends, all the while evading the US military and a duo of Decepticons who plan to bring their army and destroy the planet.This is definitely the best Transformers movie I've seen since the very first one; and that's not saying really much, cause even though Dark of the Moon is a kind of a guilty pleasure to me, all of them have been re-hashed garbage to make a quick billion bucks. New director, new era (the 80's), and John Cena has a good role to play. I also enjoyed Pamela Adlon's appearance (Marcy from Californication FYI). I like the pop culture references (SPOILER: It's Breakfast Club references), I like the side characters, the movie has great fight scenes; no more obnoxious fire work explosion fights that Bay kept putting in these movies. The CGI on the Transformers themselves was very well handled: it's never been flawless, but there are still points where I can believe Bumblebee and the Decepticons are actually there with the human characters.Another thing I loved was how it played with common cliches; it has smart writing, so you definitely know Michael Bay wasn't involved in the script. That being said, I got bored with it halfway through, the movie has a simple plot with some really underdeveloped villains, and the friendship montages and moments between Charlie and Bumblebee you've probably seen in a thousand other movies now.Another problem I have is how it fits into the franchise. I don't know if this is a prequel to the first movie, or if it's intended to be a soft reboot. At the end (SPOILER) Optimus arrives on Earth, and Bumblebee lives obviously because this is a prequel and he's the main character, but then that contradicts his (Optimus) arrival to earth in the first movie. Also at the beginning, Bumblebee is shown to have a car form already when he's fighting on Cybertron; so does Cybertron have cars?, I just thought they had car forms as a way to blend in on Earth. So, maybe this is a straight up reboot? (somethings wrong here otherwise)So overall, if you've gotten sick of Michael Bay's fall from grace since the first movie, give this a try, it's nothing special and you could really live without it, but for some new scenery, a fresh script and some decent laughs, give it a see.",Bumblebee

The rebellious teen who has a great heart but is depressed over he father's death
2.) The hard ass soldier that spouts corny knock off versions of Rambo lines and comes around to respect the main characters (and be saved by them) in the end
3.) The oblivious mother who parents her child like they are equals or siblings
4.) The Aloof Stepfather that is really kind but really annoying and proves to the rebellious teen that he is just who she needs in her corner
5.) The younger brother who does all of the stereotypical ""kid along for the ride in an action flick"" things. (I.e. the mom checks on him after the car chase and he looks terrified but says ""that. Was. Aweeesome"" and then pukes.
6.) The bad guys stating their evil plan to destroy the world every time they are on screen.
7.) The bad guys talking about their evil plans in front of the oblivious ""good guys"" where the audience can hear but the ""good guys"" can't.
8.) The government siding with the wrong side at first and then having a big ""we messed up ... now let's make this right"" moment.I could go on and on. It is just so predictable And hard to get through.",Bumblebee
263,Thekeybaldemasterrises,Transformers needed a movie like this,8,14 December 2018,"Sure you've seen this before, sure it's corny, but honestly I appreciated this movie. It's so much more coherent than the Michael Bay sequels. The action is less agitating to watch. The human protagonist is so much more believable and interesting than Shia Labeouf or Mark Whalberg's human characters. You would think after 5 movies the Transformers franchise would run out of steam and run out of ideas, with Bumblebee it's thankfully quite the opposite. This movie is everything the first live action Transformers movie should've been. It's easily the best one yet although that's not really saying much. It's got everything the fans want from the G1 character design, to the 80's nostalgic feel, but what's even better is that it's in the service of a fun movie. Sure the plot and character development are corny and a little generic at times, but if this movie came out after the animated movie in the 80's this would've been the best thing ever for me as a kid. Bumblebee is everything I wanted and more. It's fun, heartwarming, and the perfect way to introduce Transformers to a new generation. It's got great action, performances, and finally interesting human characters!! Believe me once you see the first 5 minutes. You will want more. If this is the future of the franchise then count me in. I was gonna give this an 8 but because of how much this movie did right, it's a 9! 9/10. I don't get why Angry Joe and his crew took this movie so seriously. If anyone has seen the animated movie it's totally an 80's thing. No they shouldn't stick with the same theme for allll the movies going forward but I think it's a good start and I think you should give it a chance.",Bumblebee

266,gdeangel,21st centruy of The Iron Giant,3,27 April 2019,"This film is not a Transformers film. Make no mistake, there are transformers in it. It gives some passing lip service to a space war; there is some relativist remark about ""traitors"" and ""rebellion"", as well as autobots and deceptacons, but they are just a few splotches of what might be vivid paint to color out the background of an otherwise bland movie.That movie is basically a remake of the Iron Giant, only the robot, instead of being a kind of visual towering steam-punk monstrosity which becomes humanized through the influence of a 10 year old boy and his imagination, personal ethics, and love of comic books, now a 17-year-old girl who has the character depth of a shoe sole, but is replete with angst, dead-daddy abandonment issues, and general 21st century loser-ness, is going to covet a cute ""mini size"" robot that makes the perfect car for her -- a yellow VW Beetle. At least they got the car right this time. But they are keeping (and explaining) the ""can't talk"" idiom, so 80s music will be featured heavily.Together, they will bungle through antics that were fresh with Charlie Chaplin, and got stale somewhere around the time of Beethoven's 4th. The robot will get into the house unsupervised and break things. He will do goofy and inappropriate things, like ignoring the steering wheel while the comic book ""out of touch mom"" is driving. No, I'm kidding... we don't even get that. Mostly it's interludes of flim-flamy diaglogue meant to give us an emotional investment in cut-off-tank-top 80s girl, as she explores her issues with nerdy afro-boy. And makes lemonade while wearing a doofy hat. Or was it falice like corn dogs? The movie can't make up it's mind. But it does get in it's licks against the ""plastics"", who belittle our heroine for driving a VW Beetle. A VW Beetle that, in fact, is pretty unremarkable. In a throw down between Herbie and Bumblebee, I'd put my money on Herbie.But anyway, the plastics will get their comeuppance. Household objects will be experimented with. Nostalgic 80's pop-culture will be exploited. Humans will be splatted like goo. Beard step-dad will fail to be cool driving a more historically accurate version of the Wagon Queen Family Truckster. An a couple of paper thin deceptacon baddies will overcome... somehow... the big finale battle is so ridiculous you will just have to set aside anything remotely resembling the laws of physics once again and watch the CGI in ""oooh, ahhh"" mode. Your kids will leave the theater with visions of Bumblebee merch dancing in their heads. Although they will have a pretty nominal connection to the people and attempted emotional note of in the film. So if you are raising the next generation of vacuous consumer, by all means, pick up a copy of this film for your kids. But if you want to set your kids up for an appreciation of the humanities and storytelling, do them a favor and pick up a copy of The Iron Giant instead.",Bumblebee

274,piggulu,An E.T. by any other name...,7,2 January 2019,"While I'm generally familiar with and enjoy the Transformers as a whole, I'm not a diehard fanatic, and really don't see what makes Bumblebee such a darling to the masses to warrant a standalone movie. But to each his/her own.That said, is this really a ""Transformers"" movie? Sure, it's got some of the trademarked characters, but as a my review title says, this isn't much more than ""E.T.: The Extraterrestrial"" in disguise ;). Kid meets alien (robot), hides him in closet (garage), a few antics ensue, and the government catches up. Only instead of a bug-eyed being, you got a bug-eyed mech. I bet if Bee could eat he would've downed a bag of Reese's Pieces at least once. Is it just a coincidence that Steven Spielberg is on as an executive producer? Doubt it.But is all that a bad thing? Not really. The movie does have a lot of charm/drama/humor, and what have you. But it feels more of a coming-of-age film, since the main focus is Charlie's teenage problems. While the Transformers are part of the plot, the brand isn't really integral to it and Bumblebee could've been any old macguffin without blinking much. I personally missed all the mindless spectacle and flashiness the previous films got flak for, and though there are a couple of robo-battles, they are brief and unmemorable.It is a good movie in it's own right, but a ""Transformers"" one in name only, I feel.",Bumblebee
275,walkingwithprimeval,The first PROPER live-action Transformers film to have real HEART,8,14 August 2020,"One part The Iron Giant (1999), one part Disney-Pixar's WALL-E (2008)... all Herbie the Love Bug (1968)!!! To me, this is THE Transformers movie I've always wanted to see get made into a live-action feature-length motion-picture for the big-screen, after many long years of slowly lowering my IQ from watching the infuriatingly cynical ""Bayformers"" series (JEEZ!!! I honestly can't believe I actually used to think they were ""good"" when I was younger. Guess we're all pretty gullible as kids, aren't we?).The whole reason why I even wanted to go see the Bumblebee movie was because when I first saw the teaser trailer for it, I took an immediate liking to the designs of the Transformers. They actually resembled the REAL Transformers I grew up watching on DVD as a young kid, instead of Michael Bay's redesigned style (they just looked completely unrecognisable, thanks to his production crew's misguided creative choices). So I decided to give it a fair-chance to try and impress me, just because I thought the Autobots and Decepticons finally had the correct look to them... and it delivered the GOODS!!! (but they unfortunately didn't include the original theme song, so that was a little disappointing).This is Travis Knight's directorial debut of a live-action/CGI-animated hybrid... and it's GREAT!!! It's clear that Knight is a very gifted man who expertly knows the ways of animation and has a good understanding of how to use the format in telling a well-thought-out and cohesive narrative, which is quite evident when taking a look at his notable filmography over at Laika Studios. His love and affection for the Transformers franchise shines through in almost every single frame of this well-crafted film, as it's an effective blend of the classic cartoon's art direction and playful spirit, mixed together with the modern sensibilities of fast-paced and free-flowing action sequences (just more coherently done than a lot of them are, today). He has such a huge amount of respect for the legacy of the film he's making, as opposed to someone like Michael Bay, a person who in the past has proclaimed in promotional interviews that he himself doesn't even care about the original source material and therefore, has no respect whatsoever for the films he's making (if you don't put any passion into your projects, then they'll turnout really BAD for a FACT!!!).The plot takes everything back to basics, so thankfully there's no big ""End Of The World"" doomsday scenario going on, here (instead, it gives you a ""Man On The Run"" type vibe, with Bumblebee as a fleeing fugitive evading the U.S. military). The CGI-created robot characters were all done justice to, in the RIGHT way. Even though Bumblebee doesn't have a conventional facial structure, the CGI artists sure managed to get a nice range of emotions out of him and they even gave him some amusing sight-gags, in an old silent cartoon kind of way (they certainly have enough of his cutesy shtick to fall back on). The Decepticons in this film actually speak in full sentences and have distinct personalities, unlike the ""Bayformer"" ones, which were portrayed as making stupid animalistic grunting noises and, visually, looked dumb by having their bodies be made out of sharp metal knifes with no smooth edges (they were also kind of weaklings, as they were more often than not killed off by their enemies with ease). And come to think of it, Bay's version of the robots pretty much had the life sucked right out of them, as they all felt so soulless and empty inside.We also have ourselves a very likeable cast of human characters who aren't obnoxious to have hanging around onscreen. Hailee Steinfeld's performance as the angsty but vulnerable teen who discovers and forms an unlikely friendship with the titular Autobot felt genuine. Her portrayal as a grieving young woman who's mourning the sudden passing of her father (prior to the events depicted in the film), whilst also being on the cusp of adulthood (with a barrage of new responsibilities in life), came off as heartfelt and relatable, as I'm 100% sure we've all gone through the same emotionally-stressful process of tragically-losing a beloved family member. Her newfound friendship with Bumblebee brings her a much needed sense of security as she's comforted by this hulking piece of walking metal, which is something I found to be incredibly endearing (this sweet human storyline was a much welcomed addition). Heart is something that the Michael Bay ones severely lacked, as he instead chose to mainly focus on cramming these really contrived and unfunny jokes (his crude sense of crass humour isn't the funny type) into all of his so called ""human drama"".There's a few minor things that bothered me (and it's only my personal opinion); I didn't really like that they kept Bumblebee mute, with him still talking through the use of soundbites on his car radio due to having a battle-damaged voice-box (which was such a shame, as I thought Dylan O'Brien did a decent job in the role and his voice work was well-suited to playing the character). And speaking of his vehicle disguise, I honestly wish they would've left his alternate mode as a Volkswagen Beetle and hadn't changed it to a Chevrolet Camaro (not a major story spoiler). I take issue with these details mostly because, in a weird sort of way, it means that this truly wonderful reboot is technically still connected to Michael Bay's ""Bayformers"" film universe (which is nothing more than a way to make people feel braindead), as its initial production was originally intended to be a spin-off / prequel to his first one from 2007. I strongly dislike the thought of this near-masterpiece sharing any continuity with his interpretations, at all (it's just a sad fact of the harsh reality we live in, I suppose).To all the people out there who've always regarded Transformers as being nothing more than just a bunch of senseless fighting and random explosions going off, that's all thanks to Michael Bay's own adaptations of the property misinforming the general public's perception of what it was to begin with. This on the other hand, is a way more faithfully done and accurate representation of what the Transformers brand is fundamentally about and it does the job 10 times better than any of Bay's ""efforts"" ever did, which I can be most certain of (he tarnished the franchise's reputation for many years, all because he sorely lacks any artistic integrity. To him, it was only ever about getting his hands on an easy pay-cheque and nothing else). As far as I'm now concerned, this is the only live-action Transformers movie which currently exists at this point in time, so let's just forget all about those inept cash-grabs and pretend like they never even happened in the first place (if we don't acknowledge their existence, then hopefully they'll fade away into the past and be permanently forgotten by every G1 fan out there).",Bumblebee

278,jared79,Best Transformers since the first one.,7,21 September 2019,"I haven't enjoyed a transformers movie since the first one. Michael Bay took a beloved franchise from my childhood and beat it to death. But finally, we have a good one, and he had nothing to do with it. Bumblebee is good. Not great, but good. It was heart warming, it wasn't constant metal crashing into metal and it actually had some sense of plot. Acting was good and it was also great that they gave us fans something by harking back to the 80s version of the transformers, the way they should have always been.Was awesome to see Optimus as the original truck. Anyway, good job.",Bumblebee
279,bogdanbalostin,Masterpiece compared to the last Transformers movie,6,15 April 2019,"Let me be clear about one thing. I loved the first Transformers movie. It was hectic, yes, full stuff happening and exploding everywhere, yes, but it had heart and it was epic and something totally new.Bumblebee only has the heart.You've seen this story before.And the pacing is quite slow.But the best part about it is that it made sense in a way that I could follow what was going one. Not because I'm slow or anything but have you watch the last 3 Transformers movie? There are thousands of things happening on screen that are not even really relevant to the plot. Thousand of characters with no backstory.In Bumblebee, we only meet one autobot and two decepticons. The decepticons are still shallow as characters but they are the best-written decepticons on screen since Megatron. (not that there is a high standard here lol)I enjoyed it enough, it doesn't stand to the first Transformers movie as quality or epic scale but it's way better than the last Transformers movies.",Bumblebee
280,Floki_Thorfinn,Best blockbuster of 2018,9,30 December 2018,"This prequel to the Transformers franchise is an action-packed movie that will keep you entertained from beginning to end.Young singer/actress Hailee Stanfeld performs a teenage girl in the late 80's who finds a yellow Beetle VW, which later founds out is something more than a vehicle. This resembles a lot the plot from the first movie, though the point in this one is to explain how the Transformers made their way to the Earth.The characters are good (yeah, even John Cena's), the visuals are incredible, it avoids succesfully one or two clichés, and the soundtrack, well, is just awesome, best Transformers movie so far!",Bumblebee
281,chandrabhanusolanki,It's better,7,4 January 2019,"The backstory is amazingly told in this movie. You will laugh and you will get emotional, the machine and human relationship evolved in the movie. You can watch it if you're a fan of transformers or not.",Bumblebee
282,varnium,Not Just a Robot Battle with Terrible Targeting System,9,28 December 2018,"Finally, after all these years, the franchise has decided to accommodate general viewer's expectation with mature mindset and reduce significantly the childish & meaningless aspects which cause the previous series to have bad rating.I mean, let's face it. In the previous series, everything is about stunning special effects which amaze only children. The story line is just emotionless and bland. There were no real characters in them.But this Bumblebee movie, is far from that aspect. It significantly put more depth in the story and character building. You can really feel the bond between man and machine or in this case it's between woman and machine.This should have been done since the previous series!The only flaw still exist though, but it's basically due to the entire concept of the Transformer franchise. I mean, for a super advance mechanical sentient being, which is able to transform to just about any mechanical entity, they still use primitive bullets and have terrible targeting system.When will the producers fix this concept??",Bumblebee
283,SeriousMayhem,"Has heart, but could have been quite a bit better",7,24 March 2019,"This definitely is a lot better than Michael Bay's explosions and childish jokes galore, which got worse with each installment.As a sort of prequel, it does its job nicely. The story is a bit cheesy and we've sort of basically seen it all before in the first 2007 Transformers movie, minus most of the action that one featured.This movie is mainly about the relationship between Bumblebee and protagonist Charlie (and a good chunk is just mostly about charlie and her teenage problems..), and since no doubt at least two sequels will be made, this rather slow start did not bother me. If you're expecting a blockbuster with non-stop action however, this is not it. Bumblebee has some action scenes, but nothing on a grand scale. I personally think that was a good choice, and it makes sense in light of what it wants to be (and I reckon, in light of what it doesn't want to be). I never found the movie boring.The acting is mostly good. Hailee Steinfeld pulls of a nice and believable performance. John Cena is pretty cringeworthy and I didn't overly enjoy ""goofy character"" Memo, or the parents, but I guess it could have been worse. We know it has been worse.. Still, it brings the overall quality down.As far as Bumblebee (the transformer) goes, he did feel mostly believeable and I get that we need to go through some progress/evolution with his identity/character. I am however not convinced at all that the lost puppy routine they went with (including the ears..) was the way to go. Hopefully we've seen the last of that.The music is a nice blast from the past, although they went a bit overboard with the number of songs they tried to cram into it..All in all, while a bit too ""teeny"" and a bit too ""cute"" for my tastes, this was very passable and entertaining enough to watch, but at the same time you just know it really needs that sequel (or two) to bring this full circle. If this movie would be it, a standalone single movie about Bumblebee, it just doesn't do him justice.Rating this somewhere between a 6,5 and a 7.. rounding it up to a 7/10.",Bumblebee

When B-127 arrives he is attacked by a Decepticon. And although B-127 kills the Decepticon he loses his voice box and his memory core is damaged. B-127 does scans a 1967 Volkswagen Beetle before shutting down.We then meet a young teenager - Charlie Watson - who is still grieving the death of her father. Her Uncle Hank gives her a yellow Volkswagen Beetle from his scrapyard, and as she works to repair the car it transform into B-127 - who has no memory. She names him ""Bumblebee"". Will they be able to work together keep the Decepticons from locating Optimus Prime and the remaining Autobots, and destroying the earth?Bumblebee definitely has more story and is more age appropriate than the prior Transformer movies. Every review I checked gave high grades to Hailee Steinfeld and her portrayal of Charlie. While some will note that there were not as many action sequences, it is one of the better movies in the franchise.Although there is robot violence, and some language, the movie is definitely closer to PG than PG-13. The teen romance in particular is handled quite well. Parents should know that there are still intense action sequences, a teen romance, and parental loss and remarriage.

This one has heart and soul and is just what I needed and I did not even ever watch the cartoons... It's also VERY hilarious sometimes! We needed a reboot and I am super happy we got one. Let's forget the other films ever happened, shall we...? I really hope we get to see more of Hailee Steinfeld's character in the sequel, because she was lovable!Now, one of the things I find embarrassing in the past films are the supermodel wannabees.... None of that in this film. Yes, in this film there are women dressed how I would not have a daughter of mine dress, but it's not all in your face like in the past films. I am just gonna say that Hailee Steinfeld is the most beautiful girl to ever show up in a live action Transformers film and the women in the other films are just embarrassing...This film completely disregards any jokes of any sorts, no innuendos, nothing pathetic I would hear from middle school...In all, this film rights all the wrongs from the past movies...aside from the horrible and cringey mom and stepdad in this one...the stepdad is worse than the mom...Beautiful movie!",Bumblebee

Hailee did an amazing job as a bruting, moody heartbroken teen.
Period correctness...I found the 80's presented in this movie was prefect. That was my time!!!

289,anoceanroars,Bumblebee Transforms A Franchise,8,31 December 2018,"I was surprised to hear myself say that I wanted to see Bumblebee, especially since I stopped watching them after the first couple of film. I could not understand how Megan Fox was able to remain free of grease and have perfectly coifed hair after working on an automobile. I barely touch anything on a car and I get oil everywhere.Every time I watch these films my mind goes to other places because I cannot figure out how these things work. Where does the windshield go and how does it not break, especially after the Transformer almost dies? And after a battle how does he still look clean? When the girl is thrown around a bit how does she not have some broken bones? How did the boy break his arm when he was thrown, but the girl did not? When the mom used Bumblebee to take the dog to the veterinarian how did the girl catch up to her on a moped? And what happened to the moped? How did it get home? If Bumblebee was ""dead"", how did he come back strong enough to beat up the Decepticons? There are so many questions.One thing we learned in film class was to notice the climate around the time of a film when viewing it. I have noticed something different in American films lately. It seems they are sticking to some standard of representation. I have noticed that Hollywood will put one black person in a film and make the couple a mixed couple. Do black people in the USA date or marry each other? If I go by the films, then I would say they do not. I do not have a problem with interracial relationships at all. I just think that Hollywood should go to the next level. I want to see more Asian couples. Is it a problem having two Asians in a film?Bumblebee did a switcheroo on us. It looked as if the main girl character and the nerdy black boy was going to fall in love. But, when the boy went to hold her hand at the end, she denied him. That was when I realised that I was watching a feminist film. The girl was independent of him the whole film. She never needed saving. She saved the day for the whole world. She even saved Bumblebee. Or did she? Can a human female save a Transformer? That was another question I had after watching Bumblebee.The soundtrack was great. It was filled with 80s music. I think they even Rickrolled us. The only thing I hate about the whole thing was only snippets of some of the songs played. I wish they have played more of the great songs, but less songs overall.Even with all the questions I had while watching the film I really liked it. Hailee Steinfeld shines in her role as feminist Charlie Watson. Even her names is a boys name. I rate films by their genre. This was a big popcorn film and it was satisfying. anoceanroars review",Bumblebee

293,iamjacksmoviechannel,Surprisingly has some heart,6,22 December 2018,"So have you ever wondered what a Transformers flick might look like without oogling chicks, overt racism, constant shaky cam, massive bloat, or giant robot testicles?New director Travis Knight has and it's a damn good family film.This new one has the always lovable Bee sent to establish a base for the autobots on Earth, where he befriends a teen named Charlie who helps him in a battle with 2 deceptions.Hailee Steinfeld plays Charlie, a lonely girl living in the 1980's whose been internally suffering since the death of her father.She's a change for the Transformers franchise- a girl whose emo, and more amateur mechanic than prom queen who doesn't take kindly to men telling her to smile more.For Bee his personal challenge here is his voice. He quips like Schwarzenegger before his vocal box gets cut and it's Charlie who helps him heal from that.The biggest and best change here is how much all this will slow down on occasion and we'll get a gentle, touching scene of how much these two need each other.This is the best girl and her car story since...well, Thelma and Louise. It has far less suicides.The two will bond over Alf and 80's music and the movie has the kind of cute, trample on mom's rose bushes-like physical comedy from the first one before Michael Bay felt he had to go bigger.Not only that but the action scenes are shot with a very steady hand and thankfully don't try to go for the everything and the kitchen sink approach.I think maybe being plunged into another robot battle is a bit too soon for me but it's the fact Knight makes me even want to consider seeing more that proves this is pretty well done.If you liked this, check out Craig James Review on Youtube for more.",Bumblebee

It's just terrible)In the first 10 minutes, I thought this is just a transformers reboot with a female lead. It was fine because it could have been a good opportunity because CGI is vastly improved since then. But it quickly turned out so bad I couldn't even finish it. You should be able to put this into a category like blockbuster, sci-fi or teenage movie. But it fails so badly I can say that this is none of them. It's more like a high budget TV movie made for a family channel or something. You know those kid movies with a speaking intelligent dog or pig. Bumblebee is that speaking dog here (except he doesn't speak, but you got the point). I don't even want to go into logical mistakes.By the way I love teenage movies. But as long as they have the quality of Breakfast Club, 10 things I hate about you, Say anything etc. If you're going to exploit 80s, try to go more deeper than pop icons please.

306,theoneandonlyhyperdriver,A decent Transformers movie at last,8,18 January 2019,"Simple plot, great action, and a female lead who is not a Michael Bay bimbo. Win, win, win. The humour is not forced and I actually laughed out loud a few times. Forget the other rubbish films, THIS is the first proper Transformer live action movie.",Bumblebee
307,mingsphinx,Not really a Transformers movie,5,12 May 2019,"The CGI was quite good and hence the 5 star rating. The teenage growing pains and coming of age angst was annoying and had nothing to do with Transformers whatsoever. The whole effort feels like a bad 80s movie with a very fake, plastic feel that was souped up with some expensive special effects.Since this was an origin story, they really should have done more to tie in with the rest of the Transformer franchise. Perhaps this is the reason the screenwriter for Bumblebee, Christina Hodson, will not be writing the script for the next Transformer movie. Even though Transformers as a concept is a little dodgy, it does not mean you can do whatever you want with it. You have to be into Transformers, like really be deep in that world, to produce a script that satisfy the fans.",Bumblebee
308,dyingrepublicofpanama,Absolute trash.,2,17 December 2018,Was excited by the trailers showing G1 modelled TransformersHoping we would get a transformer full action movie.We didn't.

And forever forget the chance we may get a decent live action transformers film.,Bumblebee
309,sagniknath,Thoroughly enjoyable for children while leaving adults wanting something more,6,5 January 2019,"I have mixed feelings about this movie. On one hand, I really like the newer classical robot designs, the CGI is way more organic and the robot fights actually have weight to them instead of being mindless random metal parts falling all over the screen.
My main criticism is that this is a 100% kids' movie. I acknowledge that any major pop culture artifact , from Jurassic Park to Star Wars, is mainly aimed at children, but there's always something to keep sensible rational adults interested while their kids are slobbering away at the popcorn. The plot felt like a hodge podge of ideas taken from The Iron Giant, Big Hero 6 and even Man of Steel. But even then, the byproduct appears to be more sanitized and simplistic than the original ingredients. Like, there's not a shred of adult rationality in this movie. The character decisions are rational in the sense you would observe in a Saturday morning cartoon. In fact , if you replace the live action with just animation, you would barely notice a difference.",Bumblebee
310,c_sims76,Wth,4,1 April 2019,A poor story with bad acting is just the tip of the spear for this movie. The sad background for our main character doesn't get any help by the crappy acting. Cena was more than a joke in this movie. I get it's a movie but damn a little realism would have been nice. Turning people to ooze. Diving for the 3 ton robot. That u can't lift. Just stop. Please at this point it's embarrassing.,Bumblebee
311,TheJohnnyPHreak,The Transformers Film Fans Deserved,8,16 December 2018,"Beeeeee! I'm a child of the '80s. I grew up watching Transformers, G.I. Joe and Kid Video (yeah who knows that reference?!) Back when the Transformers live-action film was announced I was so excited. Back then I was still a huge fan of Michael Bay. The film dropped and it was good. I was entertained. It was just too much Bay and not enough feeling like the cartoon (and the fantastic animated feature). Then the subsequent sequels came out. And they didn't help the case for Transformers live-action film case. I do enjoy Dark of the Moon. But these films are just for Michael Bay to get his explosions and FX rocks off. Why couldn't he take another franchise to put his stamp on?After five Bayformers movie, we are graced with Bumblebee. (Who just happens to be my favorite Transformer and Autobot) I was all on board from the start. When it was announced that it would be a Bay-less Transformers movie, I was ecstatic. From the original trailer, it seemed like a smaller film focusing on one character Hailee Steinfeld's Charlie Watson and Bumblebee. I mean yes it is a big action film but it was going to be more character focused with a streamlined plot. The animated feature was big in the '80s but it had a killer soundtrack, with characters people could get behind. I can happily say with no hyperbole, this is the Transformers movie fans deserved.Director Travis Knight (ParaNorman, Coraline) has made a film about finding your voice in the face of adversity. Charlie is a gearhead who just lost her father. Her world is up in the air. She has troubles fitting in with kids her age. She's the outcast in her family as her mother tries to move on. But her life changes after Bumblebee shows up. It is very much an alien that fell to earth that befriends a human. Not surprised with Steven Spielberg as one of the film executive producers, the film very much like E.T. And in all the good ways. Charlie and Bee bond right off the start. John Cena plays apart of the military that sees Bee as a threat. And of course, there are the government officers, military and scientist that happily think they can learn from the two Transformers that show up after Bee.Much like the film it mimics, Bumblebee has heart, it gives the characters time to develop and evolve. Steinfeld gives Charlie weight and so much emotion. Cena gets some hammy one-liners and a typical ""bad guy"" moments but even he gets to come around with a nice evolution. The film is set in the '80s and they lay it on thick, in the best ways. The soundtrack will be having you singing each song long after the film is over. The design of the Transformers is minimal. It very much appeals to the times and less jagged edge detailed oriented of Bay's films.I can't get through this review without mentioning the action scenes. Knight shoots this scenes wide, not up close. Along with the minimal design, all the action can be seen and digested. There are so big battles (including a killer opening sequence) that feel like they've been ripped from the cartoon. I can express how happy I was when I was an early chase scene where I didn't feel they just throwing things on the screen or explosion after explosion.It leads well into the Bay films if this is truly a prequel. But for me, I hope this is a soft reboot into a whole new series of live-action Transformers film. We can all just state that Bay's films don't really exist. Thankfully this is Bumblee Optimus Prime has what I would call an extended cameo in the film. He doesn't overshadow our main character.Bumblebee doesn't have the wow factor of the first film, seeing the Transformers on the screen for the first time. But this film is so full of great action moments, heart, emotion, love for this franchise and most of all fun. Parents can bring their kids but it does get a bit dark. Dear my fellow Transformer fandom, this is the film we've been waiting for. Travis Knight has created the closest film to the animated film. And for that I'm thankful.",Bumblebee
312,macfaefan,Bumblebee's Story,8,30 December 2018,Takes place years before. Good storyline mixed with the humorous moments made it a enjoyable movie. Good acting.,Bumblebee
313,cinemawithcj,Bumblebee - Cinema with CJ Review,8,18 December 2018,"Bumblebee proves that - much like Stranger Things - you can still make a classic 80s film where a mysterious endearing friend our heroes meet is chased down by the authorities while something else sinister is out there, and it's the mysterious being (and our heroes) that are the only things that can stop them and save the world.Thankfully, Bumblebee manages to capture the 80s without being too cliche. The music aren't the generic choices you'd think of most of the time (and when they are the most familiar it's done for a joke or a brilliant reference), the fashion isn't thrown in your face, and this definitely doesn't feel like it apes the style of Spielberg or other directors you see contemporaries homaging throughout their work.Bumblebee at its core is the Transformers movie we should have always got. I continue to be a defender of Michael Bay, but Transformers is where I always draw the line in admitting is where it all goes wrong. The one Spielberg reference I will say Bumblebee takes is the same Spielberg motivation set in the first Bayformers film: It's a story about a girl getting her first car. It's a mirror of the first half of the first Transformers, except it's basically the entire movie.And that's okay. Bumblebee has the action and fan-service you want from a Transformers movie (except the cartoon theme song is absent, though you get a great consolation prize), and Optimus Prime gets his time to shine, but everything else is so small scale for Hollywood. It's your ET. Your Escape to Witch Mountain. Your Harry and the Hendersons. It's the tale about something extraordinary, but it's also the tale about human beings.Hailee Steinfeld and the CG creation that is Bumblebee are the perfect duo. Steinfeld seems to be the queen of coming of age, because this is another great outing for her. She plays her role so brilliantly here, perfectly capturing the growing pains of a teenager trying to escape the boring constricting world she lives in in the wake of her father's death and everyone moving on but her. From the moment she finds Bumblebee and subsequently discovers he's a Transformer, we know we're in for something special. It doesn't hurt that Bumblebee's plot convenient voice and memory loss turns him into a giant adorable but destructive child that needs to learn things all over again but this time on a planet completely different to his own.The screenplay is simple, but effective. A lot of the beats are easily called, but it's also due to simple setup and payoff, and the payoffs are worth it. Bumblebee sets up the character backgrounds and motivations perfectly, meaning we actually care about what happens. Steinfeld's family are your typical family that doesn't know what's going on until it's too late, but comedy in exactly when they need to, and John Cena plays John Cena as perfectly as John Cena can, creating your typical military guy with a grudge for good reason, and also for the creation of good humour and side-plot.What really lacks are the antagonists. Who I genuinely cannot name. Two generic Decepticons, because of course, this is a simple small prequel flick, so we can't bust out Megatron or Starscream on Earth. Our villains here do the usual plotting and playing of the military to try and track down Bumblebee, but they don't really have much to do or say except kill things in their path and talk about killing things that will get in their path.Bumblebee isn't really a Transformers movie. Bumblebee himself is so cute and fun and hilarious, you feel like you're just watching a movie about a quirky alien a teenager has found. It brings in the Transformers when it needs to, but for the most part, this is a kid and their robot, and that's all you need.It's a solid coming of age movie and the perfectly balanced 80s movie. It's a fun two hours at the cinema that doesn't drag. The cast is brilliant and it gives you the journey you want, even if it doesn't quite blow you away if you're expecting the blockbuster action fest some of the trailers and the legacy of the Transformers have sold you on.Hopefully it does well at the box office for what it is, because Bumblebee is definitely the best Transformers movie out there that isn't animated. It just has that touch about it.It has the power.",Bumblebee

The director tells a story of the character who finds Bee. The main character Bee, forgets who he is until the end. I believe this is an attempt to extend the movie plot. Editing is better compared to other films. The fight scenes is good but a style that people never seen would have been good to add to Bee battles. But, sound quality and FX is good.

I can finally say we second good Transformers movie with this standalone Bumblebee movie. This is a movie with a lot of heart and that's not just due to Bumblebee but also with the human characters. They finally got a great lead with Hailee Steinfeld who gives a damn solid performance in this. The entire cast was good no one seemed like they were phoning it in for a paycheck. The action in this movie is a major step up from the sequels, you can actually tell what's going on and the visuals are beautiful and detailed.

This one is in another class entirely. In fact, the first fifteen minutes or so are about as perfect as any film I've ever seen to the point that I'm tempted to research how it was done, though a piece of me still wants to just sit back and be awed.Part of the beauty of this film is that the story begins in a fairly routine and familiar way, but when anything's executed this skillfully, you immediately know you're in the hands of master movie-makers. It's as fresh and delightful as a newborn. And though the first fifteen minutes or so are near perfect, the rest of the movie falls off only slightly, and is unusually satisfying. As a whole this may be the best movie I've seen in a year, which is saying a lot. It deserves much more attention and everyone involved should be quite proud.",Bumblebee
327,chasemykleby,This is the Transformers' movie we needed and wanted from the beginning.,9,9 March 2019,"""Bumblebee"" Review
(9/10)This. This is the Transformers' movie we needed and wanted from the beginning. Travis Knight crafts a beautifully made story for once in a Transformers movie. We get a real relationship between robot and machine that we actually care about.
Where wanton destruction is concerned, Knight is keenly aware that less is more, and while Bay demolished cities with abandon, he carefully rations out the violence to make each blow count. Knight's experience at Laika comes to the fore here, years of painstaking stop-motion lending an eye for expression as Bee takes in the world around him. It's a sensibility balanced perfectly by Steinfeld's Charlie, still raw from the death of her father. Bumblebee enters her life when she needs him most and the relationship is believable and touching - an '80s pairing of child and creature that (deliberately) conjures Elliott and E.T.. This partnership is the film's beating heart and draws us in as the pair's bond deepens - she training him like a giant, five-ton puppy and he filling the void left yawning by her loss.
From an electrifying prologue depicting the fall of Cybertron (in which we're treated to a rapid-fire line-up of fan favourites, ripped from the cells of the 1984 cartoon), it's clear Knight has a deep-seated affection for Transformers, hitting every nostalgic note with a virtuoso's ear. The design of the robots is fantastic. There is a sprinkle of Bay Transformers, but overall they all retain their classic look from the 80s.
In the end, it's not from Bay but rather the movie's other big-name producer that Knight has drawn inspiration. Steven Spielberg's DNA feels baked into Bumblebee, resulting in an '80s movie not just in setting and aesthetic but also sensibility. An impassioned ode to both the toys and their era, this, at last, is the Transformers movie we've been waiting for.",Bumblebee
328,nizzambaharuddin,EXCITING NEW DIRECTION FOR TRANSFORMERS,7,11 December 2019,"Plot is rehashed / ripoff straight from ET. Or at least you can feel the homage to ET.

More of this and I might like Transformers again.",Bumblebee
329,mossow92,This was a good film (except for the scenes I couldn't see that included a certain wrestler.),7,21 January 2019,"The Transformer movies have steadily slid into convoluted messes of CGI and plot holes. So, heading into this one I didn't know what to expect. This still had the robot fighting action you expect but seemed to take a step back from the other films and focus on a well-written story. Hailee Steinfeld is good in her role. She along with the ET-esque Bumblebee carry the heart of the film and force the audience to care about the ""Robots in Disguise,"" something earlier films in the series seemed to have forgotten about. John Cena is also decent in his role. Overall, it's a cute and fun story of loss and rising from the ashes of that loss to return to life again. In my opinion the best one in the series.",Bumblebee
330,Kumarh02,Bumble-Herbie,6,16 December 2018,"Who knew - the famous autonomous VW beetle of the 70's was a Transformer all along! The humorous element of the series tips over into the utter nonsense and in the process loses its identity. First 10-15 minutes are promising and then it's downhill from there.

I watched them at home and...generally got bored and starting to wish they would end. It was the effects that wow'd people. Not the plots.Bumblebee was recommended by The good Doctor at Wittertainment and boy, he was right.It's a fun simple plot, contains the right amount of action with a bit of sentimentality thrown in. Ms Stanfield is excellent, really getting me to believe she cares for this Autobot!When everyone is used to crystal clear CGI, it is time to spend some time and money on the acting and the plot.So no skantily clad bimbo running around to give teenage boys a thrill here. No fight scenes with so much CGI you haven't a clue what you are supposed to be doing.A definite movie for all ages. The adults will enjoy the awesome nostalgic 80s soundtrack too!Well done to the Writers and Directors and the Studio for giving this a shot. Someone woke up and realised the franchise was in the pan and needed to change direction.Will it win Oscars, no. Maybe it won't even surpass some of the original's box office takings.

Unfortunately the movie doesn't have much action scenes that you would expect from a transformers movie.
Instead you get a transformers prequel thay focuses on a teenager who finds bumblebee who is in hiding and pretty beat up because of past events.

As you can see from the title and my rating of 5/10 this was nothing new or improved for me. Hot female lead replaces wimpy, uncertain male lead. Wimpy, nerdy male replaces original hot female supporting actress. New no-last-name (that I noticed) annoying, dysfunctional family replaces original annoying, dysfunctional Witwicky family. Similar unfunny visual humor. Same overacted human drama. Transformer CGI was slightly better I guess, but then they only really used 3 Transformers throughout the movie. The real problem for me is still the same. The old animated series was about Transformers with humans in a minor supporting roll. The new movies are all about the Humans, with Transformers as the subplot. Of course, in my theater, the target audience of 6 to 10 year olds, laughed and clapped throughout the movie while the parents mostly played with their smartphones or sat silent, and I'm sure this one will rake in the cash. I just wonder why they pretended to reboot the franchise if they're going to continue along the same human-centered storyline. Thumbs down for me.",Bumblebee
337,coynieuk,Fantastic well balanced and thought through,10,30 September 2020,I am transformers fan form why back my brother had the comics we watched the cartoon and also think even Stevens is a very clever bit of TV in part because of LaBeouf. As for fox I know she's been under the knife but so had Monroe and fox is way hotter and happily a half decent actressSo when I say this is the best transformers Movie it comes from some one who's girlfriend said I have never seen you with a bigger smile on your face when we watched the first one (she hated it)I understand what transformers is its Fast and Furies with robots it puts a family and friends in an adventure dose it make up for the terrible plots no but the hummer does the humanity is what makes it work the robots are the grins the family are the funThat's why this is the best the get the balance right we have a family and friends and an adventure with robots this has a sensible plot (for an action movie) and lots of hummerI even know the origins for this movie from the comics and it puts a smile on my face to see it adapted in to a wonderful peace of film I get the critics who cant get there heads round the pace and the kids but remember LaBeouf Fox were kids so was Peltz all in high school What you cant get your heads around is this character is not a Monroe type more a Garland sort and for this story we need it slow it down build the drama and reset to the start.Remember this Fox was never bettered as we never see any of the replacements in more than one Huntington-Whiteley Peltz Haddock had very high hopes for Haddock a very good actress and a fun and funny character (like taylor from the first one) would have loved to see an older wiser fox with haddock try to control a baddy? Chan a truly fantastic actressBack to this movie an action movie with good characters and good story for goodness sake they actual managed to make this fit in before the first movie (think agents of s.h.e.i.l.d. levels of clever writing) not easy So we can have all the big bangs and robots and poor plots with no thought about progression actual no thought at all I feel there is a need to see a story told of your going to have six plus movies but it takes guts and you have to find writers and directors who know how to do it and bay can't do it hot (teens) big bangs and buckets of bullets yes but I can see that in Die Hard or Fast & Furious for that,Bumblebee

The Last Knight which i still enjoyed was probably my least favourite of the lot but Bumblebee was trash by comparison. I'd heard great hype about this one so i was looking forward to it. This was not a Transformers movie, this was a teen romantic drama that happened to have some robots jotted throughout.As this is basically a teen romantic drama then i'd recommend and and all of these cool movies over Bumblebee...Pretty In Pink, Sixteen Candles, Some Kind Of Wonderful, Girls Just Wanna Have Fun, The Duff, The Edge Of Seventeen and The Diary Of A Teenage Girl. Bumblebee is a poor B-movie version of one of those classic movies.You can see clearly that the budget is lower. The short opening scene is the best bit with the battle on Cybertron, and the alternative 80's tunes that they used in the first 30 minutes of the movie...the budget for music and licensing fees must have run out by that point of the movie lol.After the battle on Cybertron it becomes a coming-of-age movie about a angsty teen girl. I really did try to enjoy it throughout as a fan of the previous series but this is not what i paid for, no way.I found myself constantly frustrated while watching this, i just couldn't believe a Transformers movie could be dull, cheesy and humourless, with a story that centres on an old simplistic romantic drama formula aimed at teen girls or fathers with young daughters. They didn't do anything new with that formula besides add robots.The military parts which came in randomly felt like they suddenly appeared from another movie lol, their dialog and performances were like it was taken from a cheap B-movie or some 80's comedy tv shows. It's not the actor's fault because those actors are great in other movies but it's what they were given to work with here. Unless they were paying homage to 80's tv shows i don't get it!The action wasn't anything amazing like the hype machine has been feeding us, its definitely no better or worse than the previous ones.So, if you want to see an unconvincing sulky girl with issues, shed a few tears in a few sad scenes about her father then this film will be right up your street. If you want a manly action film with humour and peril throughout then this film will leave you confused.2/10",Bumblebee

344,luningyuan-23687,"Bumblebee, good fiction movie release in a wrong time",8,15 December 2018,"Bumblebee directed by Travis Knight, from Kubo and Two Strings. A very talented director who bring the Transformers series movie finally into a brand new place. Comparing past five transformers movies, no doubt this is the best of the series. The story have a very clear main line, combining with many side lines make this bumblebee much more real than ever.
Movie like Transformers, Godzilla, King Kong are all facing a same problem, where to place the human characters? When big monsters like those above fighting together, human beings like an ant to them. People cannot directly fight them also need a perfect excuse to help them which under the limits of human beings. In this movie, writers give Charlie the perfect job, wake up bumblebee and disconnect the alien energy stuff. It's not a very easy piece for her but totally she can do it and without big logic loophole.
The relationship between Bumblebee and the Charlie is quite beautiful. From afraid each other, to bounding together, to the eventually trust. When Charlie history the alien energy on that tower, Bumblebee looked at her for one second and then decided continued fighting with Shatter (Red robot). Bumblebee trust Charlie can do it and decided to fight with Shatter, buying her some time instead of destroy the alien stuff by himself, leaving both of him and Charlie in a danger of being sneak attacked.
But this good movie really in a wrong time. All those cinemas are playing Aquaman in their IMAX or 3D screens, only a few screen for bumblebee which is a way better movie than Aquaman. Again, Aquaman that movie sucks. Please buy a ticket for Bumblebee, which definitely not a waste of your time like Aquaman.",Bumblebee
345,nirome,Transformer movie with story and actual characters in it,8,18 January 2019,"Best Transformer movie ever. Period. And the difference is that, this time, they're actually telling a story with characters in it and everything. Who knew?. For the last few years, the Transformers saga has been getting worse and worse when it comes to its screenplay and acting, although I must say, Mark Wahlberg was a massive improvement over Shia Lebouf, while the craftmanship behind its elaborate visual effects got better and better. Sadly, that was never enough to tell a coherent story and we always ended up focusing more and more on the 'human' characters than on the actual protagonist of the movies, which are supposed to be the Transformers, and more attention was also paid to elaborate and long winded fight scenes.
This time we get to experience for the first time what a Live Action Transformers movie is supposed to look and feel like. That is, no overcrowding of pointless and annoying characters on the screen that serve no other purpose than to be comic relief, no leering shots of your stunning looking but useless female counterpart who forgot to go to class the day they were teaching acting lessons and above all, no abuse of over the top visual effects to conceal the fact that there's no story behind it all.
This one is pretty much straightforward, there's no dead space, it takes its time to develop its characters and story and what action scenes there are, are there as part of the storytelling process and not for the sake of showing off how good the special effects guys are at their job.
We get to hear Bumblebee's voice, although briefly, for the first time ever. Digital rendering of the main character is superb. It's extraordinary how much those robot eyes can express. The relationship between family-estranged teenager Charlie ( a wonderful Haylee Stansfield) with Bumblebee reminds me of that of Elliot with ET in Spielberg's 80s blockbuster. The 80s setting helps support that overall feeling and the funniest scene in the movie, when Bumblebee wrecks havoc after been left alone in the house, reminds me of a similar scene in ET. The military tough guy played by John Cena doesn't turn out to be a muscle bound idiot hell bent on destroying robots. There's lots of touching moments throughout, not only between Bumblebee and Charlie but also between Charlie and her mother. Needless to say, in the end they managed to patch up their deteriorating relationship and because of their mutual experiences with Bumblebee and each other, they are all the better for it. The movie mainly works because it chooses to focus on the relationship between a much smaller set of characters than usual and the title character is finally, after all these years, given the love and attention it deserves. Feel good movie that'll make you fall in love with the franchise again.",Bumblebee

347,justicewillprevail,Decepticons are messing with IMDB,1,30 December 2018,"... because there's no way this film deserves 7.3 (as of 30th Dec 2018). There's a whole lot of bumble and only one scene of bees. It's almost as if the writer has ADHD.E.g. continuity errors such as characters and clothes can change any time, I was blown away. Plotlines are abandoned as soon as they get interesting; imagine a love interest that disappears off a cliff. Hardly anything makes you care for the characters.But hey, there were a couple of decent action scenes. Yay.",Bumblebee
348,combatph,Destroyed storylines from movies and comics.,3,25 December 2019,"Already established in previous movies Bee has been on Earth on for years and years prior to this movies arrival. But it's like oh we forgot he fought with the OSS in WWII and has been establishing the Autobot beach head and tracking Deceptacons for years here. Also, it was established that he lost his voice in a battle on Cybertron. Then you have Sector 7 wearing british style rank. Then killing off other main Autobot characters like Cliff jumper. It's like the people that make these movies have never read the comics, watched the cartoons as a kid in the 80s and early 90s or give a crap about established storylines. Way to ruin an already great character and some how making him less of a scout/warrior and badass.",Bumblebee

351,alesisqs61,Imagine if this was the very first Transformers,9,24 December 2018,"This is how the first movie should have started but we can't erase history. Charlie and Bumblebee honestly have a much, much better connection together than Shia's character in Transformers. This movie is mostly about Bumblebee and her and the plot is not deep but the characters are deeper than the Bay films. It's a shame Travis Knight had felt the need to connect this film to Bay's Transformer movies because this could have been a good reboot since Transformers turned into a pile of garbage. The movie's always had some cool moments but overall they simply got worse and worse and more hype but never actually delivered the experience the fans deserved. I felt that The Last Knight was nearly unwatchable after watching it the first time. Transforming became a joke and was basically barely used anymore. The ending of this could have ushered in a new era of actual good films but since they connect to Transformers 1, we sort of get robbed of what could have become something interesting. A lot of time from the end of this until the first T1 movie transpired but Charlie basically is a one and done character which is a bummer for the franchise in my opinion but a good thing for maybe this movie as a stand alone film. I had a great time watching the film and Bumblebee does not disappoint but the only major weakness in bringing in Sector 7.... yet again tied to Transformers... uggg..... I'd have preferred the military not even be involved at all but it is what it is. I'd have also preferred more ""decepticons"" come and have Prime show up for the finale but I suppose that also sounds cliché. Bumblebee has to be the hero of the movie as Prime is usually the hero of all the other movies. I'm just trying to say that had this not connected the others, they could have went all out but it felt a tad held back actually by the other films. That's why I took away a point. It did not suffer at all without Bay.... the style might not quiet have been as ""Hollywood"" however I think that made it a bit more 80s. His style fit the movie quiet fine. Glad I got to see this... as this wipes out the part of the bad Transformers movies. Had this been an actual reboot and had Prime come with the others, I'd have seriously given it a 10/10.",Bumblebee

354,nestoryaviti,Back to the franchise's heart,10,5 May 2019,10/10 right of the bat. Why? Because finally this franchise realises its actual strenghts and weaknesses. Graphics and scifi eye candy yes (Strength). Thinly written characters (weakness) well not anymore hopefully. Bumblebee is a well written film and that alone is very refreshing in this franchise. I just hope it keeps things that way. Cena is always fun. Haley is extremely gifted. But bee in this movie is phenomenal. I love it. Keep it up.,Bumblebee

Not the movie anyone wanted to see.",Bumblebee
357,pixiekatten,Humblebee,7,30 August 2019,"I just really enjoyed this movie. It has heart and a bit soul - a likeable bot and good paced plot. It has also action and a few laughs. It does very well without pouty trout lips and survives on a script that works, acting that is far better than in any of the other Transformer movies, and come on - it's Bumblebee. Whats not to like! The CGI is great. Since the very first T movie I have been blown away by the transformations, and this flick does not disappoint either.

Yes, it's predictable in the way that within the first 10 minutes, you'll know the way the story goes in this movie. But, come on... It's Bumblebee! You just gotta love him.

Throw in a nerdy sidekick and some funky music and go save the world!Yeah, it was flawed, yet not bad. I'd liked the character of Bumblebee and it was cool to watch his origin story.

Have no clue to why the writers of this movie can call themselves writers!?The humour is not particularly funny and is off key most of the time. The 80s music played in this music gives it an 80s feel but the overall movie is ruined with bland humor with an absolute shoddy story line that made me wish it was finished already because a boring day in my life is more entertaining than this movie.I had good hopes for this one but it did not fail to disappoint.",Bumblebee

365,criscrossin,Liked it in bits and parts,6,11 May 2019,"I think this series is over and done with. Anyway, this new story is a restart from the first part of the original series. The freshness is impossible to achieve but it tried well.
The girl, charlie stays with her mom, brother and mom's bf, whom she doesn't like at all.
Bumblebee has come to earth to secretly make a base where the autobots can stay and launch a resurgence against the deadly decepticons. He loses memory and voice following a fight with a decepticon and stays underground in a garage as a VW Beetle. from where Charlie gets him as a gift. Being a naturally gifted mechanic, she restarts Bee and gradually becomes his trusted friend. There are some cute and tender moments here. Both of them learns to love each other. The prospective bf of charlie also helps. Nice drives and the western california seaside driving, makes for great viewing.
Interplay of her memory of father and achieving something independent of her mother, drives her timeline. She thinks bee will help her somehow. The playing of different radio-stations as per the mood of the dialogues was a good idea. Enjoyed the songs.
Meanwhile Bee's holographic memories trigger off the decepticons and they land on earth to destroy him and consequently Optimus prime and autobot secrets. They hoodwink the scientists and military command of the USA to help them find Bee. John cenna as a commander, doesn't trust them but has to obey his bosses, who wants to destroy all of the decepticons also , but after finding out Bee. This strategy is bound to backfire as they don't know the extent of power of the decepticons.
Anyhow, the recovery of memory of Bee at the right moment saves the day. Optimus prime also is happy. The chase scenes were well shot with humour, specially the zigzag patter of driving.
I particularly liked the young lady as charlie. She has a freshness and audacity which is lovable. I liked her in true grit also. Her young brother was also well cast.
The family learns to help each other and loses the estrangement over the death of her dada and moves on. The army and Cenna believes them and Bee.
And the autobots live to fight another day.
The story doesn't have any new leads and so feels a bit been there, done that type zaded to me. The girl stands out and also to some extent her boyfriend. Cenna doesn't have any backing of the script and feels forced to ham around. The mother is decent. Exasperated at the teenager's rebellious attitude but realizing the pain of the loss of her husband has hurt the daughter too much, tries not to discipline her too much. That's believable.
Decent film. Don't expect anything great.",Bumblebee

Don't whether it was because it was set in the 80s and with the 80s soundtrack, but had quite a nostalgic feel for me.For me this was a proper Transformers film, bringing back memories of reading the The Transformers where Spike finds the beetle form of Bumblebee.The beginning was basically a whose who of classic Transformers ie Soundwave, Shockwave, Ravage, Cosmos etcStoryline was a hell of a lot better than the last two Transformer films, hopefully this will give it a fresh reboot.Was quite impressed with Hailee Steinfeld she was able to carry off the lead role nicely, I think this young girl will go far with her acting career, comes across as a good young actor.In Optimus Prime's words....

However I have to say that this was great. Gone is Michael Bay serving as producer on this one, gone is the cheesy acting and unnecessary cgi. Instead we get a great story based in the 80s with a cool soundtrack. If you were brought up in the 80s you've seen this sort of thing before but it's executed so well that you'll enjoy it. The action is controlled you can see what's happening which is a welcome change and it's underpinned by a good script and assured direction. A fun movie...go see it.",Bumblebee

Not just because Bumblebee is my favorite Autobot. But Michael Bay did a great job with themeing the whole movie, it was set in the 80s and everything around just felt like the 80s, the music, devices, outfits, everything! Bumblebee is one of the best characters in the franchise and with this movie they just prove us he really is just as powerful as Optimus Prime. It's good to see that this movie is mostly focused on the Autobots and not focused at all on the human side. That's just exactly what the transformers franchise is.
The effects were also on point, it's great to see how the cinematography industry has advanced and it for sure looked real and not that much of a fantasy unlike in the other movies.",Bumblebee

It has the great classic feel and look of the 80s cartoon that we all know and love with various 80s references like clips from breakfast club and the weird science song.

This is a nice big budget popcorn action movie aimed at 8 year old kids, which adults can endure watching with them. The story is predictable and a little slow at times but the start and finish will make people forget the crappy stuff in the middle. The film is set in 1987 yet most of the soundtrack is from 1985, which doesn't make sense as radio wouldn't be playing those songs anymore, and the movies in the background are from 1985 also. The movie suffers from a desire to fit into this hip retro thing that shows are trying their best to do at the moment but very few are doing successfully, Bumblebee included. Some of the CGI scenes are also an issue with a dive off a very high cliff taking a split second to land (is it so hard to get someone to do a real jump off a cliff into water these days) and also when Bumblebees head changes size when he is interacting with the humans for a hug.

I'm amazed.Bumblebee is an awesome film. We get to see Cybertron, which has a 80's retro feel to it with just the right amount of seriousness and darkness. The movie is a lot more drama-driven than the previous films, but also has a very good amount of action, all while staying very family-friendly and true to the franchise's origins.The music of the movie is great, with an 80's feel to just about everything. Travis Knight and Paramount Pictures have taken the Transformers franchise to the next level here and did a wonderful job of connecting Bumblebee to Michael Bay's 2007 Transformers.This is an awesome prequel and I would love to see more Transformers movies that take place in the same time-period (which they could definitely do with Optimus Prime).Hailee Steinfield carried the film perfectly.

And let's face it, it's what the series needed after the latest Bay sequels got too bloated.I can see how it would work really well with younger viewers but I couldn't connect. Hailee Steinfeld makes it watchable and the animation of Bumblebee is quite good in a couple of parts. Otherwise it feels like it was written someone who watched a lot of 80s films but never actually experienced them. Turns out the director was the right age but he seemed to be trying too hard to fit every reference he could into every scene.Overall it passed the time but I never felt moved, connected or excited, so this one sits right in the middle for me - 5/10.A solid effort and a step up from the last 4 Transformer sequels.",Bumblebee

381,jadongarcia,Basically a disney Transformers film,7,15 January 2019,"Now it ain't bad, however it is annoying how light-hearted it is, at some points its even cringeworthy. For instance that little brother of Charlie, is cringeworthy, and the fact that the parents were part of the action towards the end was just so corny and cheap. The action was great, I'm not a huge fan of the G1 concept but man did the visuals look great.The teenage life of Charlie Watson played by he singer/actress ""Hailee Steinfeld"" was quite dramatic, in a good way of course, a but predictable but gave the movie a motive into developing a bond between bumblebee and Charlie. Her arc was great for the most part, her past with her father had a very sorrow tone which again was good so that she ""feel like herself once again"" as she says in the end.Although it was a solo film for bumblebee, it was quite satifying hearing and seeing the great Optimus Prime on screen again Voiced by none other than the legend himself Peter Cullen. I also wanted more of that cybertron scene, it was short but sweet. The acting in this film was also very astonishing even by John Cena.",Bumblebee
382,Yee_Reviews,An Overrated Generic Film,5,13 December 2018,"Good: The relationship between Hailee Steinfeld & Bumblee has its charm and the scenes showing Bumblebee adjusting to the environment are great. Some action scenes are entertaining. Some nostalgia references. The pacing is fine and workable. Hailee Steinfeld is the only actress to do a decent job...Bad: John Cena does not add anything special to the movie and is too dramatic, only used for his huge figure and loud shouting. I prefer Mark Wahlberg over John Cena. The love interest and family dynamic feel forced and is not handled well with a lack of chemistry. The dialogue is basic and most of the jokes are what you would expect from a Transformers movie. The villains are generic.Overall: The whole film is generic and basic with its plotline and characters. Hailee Steinfeld was the best part of the movie, but she did do a better job in ""The Edge of Seventeen."" Although it is not as action packed as the previous Transformer films, the movie lacks an interesting storyline to carry the movie. Travis Knight did a decent job with what he was given. Just look at the writer, Christina Hodson's, history, nothing imaginative or creative.
The reasons for its rave reviews are because of its fresh take on the Transformer's franchise and nostalgic references, but the high score is not justifiable as ""E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial"" is a much better movie and ""Stranger Things"" has enough 80s references.2.7/5",Bumblebee

It's so much better, I wonder why? *cough* Michael Bay *cough* Travis Knight's first outting since the amazing Kubo and the Two Strings brings a much needed freshness to the stale-since-the-beginning franchise. He showed he's capable of directing live action and does it admirably. Some of the shooting locations were genuinely beautiful and really gave you a good feel of the environment. Hailee Steinfeld is one of the best actresses working today and even along side a giant yellow robot she's convincing in her role. The smaller scale played a huge part in why I think this is a success, whenever there was action there wasn't a million robots going berserk on each other. The action scenes were very well choreographed too, which I was suprised by. The CGI was nothing special but they still made a few fully realized autobots and decepticons. Yet I'll still never understand how they know to transform into cars before ever setting foot on earth. Overall, it's a really good popcorn movie and solid movie in general. If the Transformers series wants to keep going, use this as the template.",Bumblebee
386,sourya-mukherjee,Disappointing!,5,6 January 2019,"There's nothing new in the story line. I have a feeling that the transformers franchise is on a downwards spiral. While the acting is fair and unlike many of its predecessors the length of the movie is comparatively shorter, the movie fails to make a lasting connection with the audience. The humour in the film is ordinary & the VFX/SFX is nothing we've not seen before. Overall, while the movie isn't boring, it's not a complete entertainer either. You might want to give this a miss 🙄",Bumblebee

388,martymasta,True to the art style and lore!,9,6 January 2019,"While I am happy with what Michael Bay has done to transformers up to last knight (awesome fighting sequences and Steven Jablonsky got us some insanely good soundtracks), this really is the best transformers movie in the franchise. I could tell for the most part who the autobots and decepticons were just by looking at them and I loved it! This movie has action, humor, sad scenes and pretty much everything you'd expect from a transformers movie! The only drawback is the forgetable music, I can understand wanting to move on from Jablonsky, but the music was not memorable at all. Other than that I loved it, looking forward to more!",Bumblebee
389,Gigantoscula,Overrated as usual,5,28 January 2019,"Who paid you to review this movie so highly? I never was into Transformers besides the 00' cartoons and this movie didn't really get me back into it. Where do I get started. It felt like a bore fest. Nothing happened throughout the movie. I excepted a lot of explosions and stuff. Not my cup of tea but that's what I felt going into it. Nope, all I got was some corny jokes and laughable dialogue. Was it supposed to be dramatic? I read the movie from the very start and as predicted, it wasn't good. People need to reconsider reviewing that highly those kind of movies. I'm looking at you people that rated this 10/10.

It's about Charlie, her backstory, and her need to move beyond her dad's death. It's also about the military and Decepticons working together to find Bumblebee, or maybe not. And there's a couple of extra plot lines about Charlie's family life and maybe a love interest. And something about her fixing cars, or was that diving, with her dad before he died.Kind of wish they'd written a tight script about a girl getting over the death of her father when she discovers an alien robot, something along the lines of ""*Batteries Not Included."" Use this film to have fun and form an emotional connection to the characters of Charlie and Bumblebee. Use that to pull us into the next film when we fight Decepticons.

392,rolando19552001,Bumblebee,9,21 December 2018,"BumblebeeThe best Tranformers movie in the new six movie franchise. Michael Bay´s tragic flaw was always missing and not learning and understanding that a movie, a film needs a backbone, plot, heart of characters and Bay´s panache for the spectacular and awe and shock super effects got tired at the end of the fifth film, but there are good news for Transformers fans everywhere, rejoice, Bumblebee has the backbone of the stories and good characters like the heroine played by actress Steinfeld who found answers for her pain and suffering, she had lost her dad when the young Bumblebee appears in her life to bring joy to her world. Spielberg is an executive producer and for once since the first Transformers movie in 2007, the savants' hand is clearly seen calibrating what is mostly a similarity with ET, the Spielberg 1980s movie that talks about finding a friend in difficult times. There is a poster of Spielberg´s own movie Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark in the room of one of the friends and admirers of Charlie, the character played by Steinfeld.
The plot is simple, Bumblebee is sent to Earth, from a climactic battle in the home planet of the Transformers in Cybertron, to find a refuge and safe haven for the Autobots in their never ending war with the Decepticons. There are great 1980s Easter eggs and call backs to the 1980s decade of music, of the 1980s Transformers animated movie and series. Bumblebee must fight for that safe haven and to be able to bring Optimus Prime to Earth for the next phase of the battle of the Transformers. Bumblebee the film had heart with the relationship between the robot and her human friend Steinfeld who meets the robot, like him, in their most vulnerable moments. The movie is a great emotional ride and a star vehicle for the budding actress Steinfeld. Also Spielberg touch is clearly seen more this time around, good movie, the reviews said that they are fresh that is the word in the street, and the word is true.",Bumblebee

No recycled format, and no two dimensional characters. This is the also the first film not to be directed by Michael Bay, and it really shows. Nice and simple direction without any weird artsy angles.Charlie is a well written character and has a purpose within the story. You feel the connection between her and Bumblebee. I just wish it didn't have to end.John Cena's character is surprisingly well done as well. Gives a good performance and funny one liners.My only complaint is that the two Decepticons are sadly forgettable. I would've preferred Cons we all know and love, but at least they aren't slotted in there just for the sake of selling toys.This movie feels like a love letter to all the classic fans of Transformers and lovers of the 80s as it includes hidden Easter Eggs and many loved songs.",Bumblebee

I was so excited to see Transformers come to life one the big screen in a way I of course would've never thought possible as a kid. The ones to follow were ok and toward the last two the stories were pretty bad. I still enjoyed them for what they were. But Bumblebee made me feel like I was watching the first one all over again. I think anyone that grew up in the 80's will definitely see why this movie makes you feel nostalgic. They have some of the original Transformers and the story line feels like an 80's movie. Thus the reference to one of the best movies EVER...The Breakfast Club. I enjoyed this so much and hope that this is the start of something special going forward.,Bumblebee
398,brandon_foore,Bumblebee,9,24 December 2018,"Easily the best Transformers movie ever made. The story is very strong, has alot of heart and doesnt beat you over the head with loud explosions, racial stereotypes and pointless side plots that go nowhere. It's clearly borrowing elements from The Iron Giant and it really works here, the performances and characters are also really likeable with Haylee Steinfeld really bringing her A game to this movie.

407,smokedsalmoned-28058,Bumblebee is a non wimpy ET with near as much heart. Finally a good Transformer movie.,9,26 December 2018,"Went to see this with my wife on Christmas night 2018.
The reviews were good on rotten tomatoes so we took a chance tough we are not big fans of the transformer movies. Those movies have great special effects but they are the empty calorie sugar pop of movies.
This was different. The acting was better, the story pared down to one robot and two villians was focused and allowed for ""character"" development. You ended up giving a damn about this robot.
There was a solid back story for the bumblebee, why he cant talk and for actress who played off him. There was a young romance, family drama, humor and pratfalls that worked.......along with only two bad guys that allowed you to develop some bag guy character.
This is set in the 80's so be prepared for some The Smiths and other such wonderful 80's music.",Bumblebee
408,jhalcollege,It's okay,5,4 January 2019,"One thing is for sure: Bumblebee is much more down to earth than the other five Transformers movies. Without Michael Bay, the movie feels much more grounded in realism than the previous entries. Gone are the scenes of dozens of mechanical beasts destroying all of Chicago, and it mostly boils down to Bumblebee and the two decepticons chasing him.One of the highlights is John Cena, who is hopefully going to become the next Rock.The guy killed it out there. And Bumblebee also lasts as long as it needs to. It doesn't have the 150 minute run time that the other iterations have, which is a welcome surprise.One of the film's largest flaws is the number of overused cliches. The main human character, Charlie, lost her father a few years ago (because why would he still be alive), and is on the verge of 18. She struggles with her mother and step dad, and is is not much more than a stereotypical Hollywood teen. There's also a guy who lives across the street, but he has never talked to her once, and looking back, he doesn't do much for the movie.Aside from that, there's a mandatory scene of Bumblebee incidentally smashing objects, and Charlie watching an old video of her dad. There's a high school 'party' of sorts, and awkward kiss, and a little more teen angst than is necessary.Lastly, it's hard to place the movie in a single genre. Sure, a giant robot from outer space sounds to be science fiction, but enough of the movie seems real enough that calling it sci fi doesn't quite cut it. Is it a comedy? While there are funny moments, there aren't enough good jokes (and there are too many cringe moments). Coming of age? Perhaps, but if it is, then it's not a good one. While trying to balance so many genres at the same time, the film ends up not really being any of them.",Bumblebee
409,Kilroy5150,"When the Transformers franchise needed a boost, they got this...",5,26 July 2020,"The Transformers franchise spun out of control in the second movie. The story-line was just too messed up and it just got worse from there. I am actually surprised this franchise has made it that far.A ""cute"" movie is not what this franchise needed. The molded an action series into ""a girl and her robot car"" movie and just about ruined it. This film made about 3x it's budget which isn't impressive and i can see why.Bumblebee was one of the least interesting Autobots back in the day, but that seems to be a common thing among the movie-makers, pick the least interesting character and try and make him/her interesting. It worked with Aquaman but there are so many it didn't work with.And this whole girl/car thing it's cliché from back in the 70s. And yes, my sister was one of those girls who wanted to be associated as a ""car"" girl back in the 70s. And then there was the racial pairing element, trying to draw a diverse crowd in, i saw that one coming a mile away.The only redeeming quality of this movie....the soundtrack.But i find it interesting how IMDB picks the most positive reviews to put in the front rather than one saying it was mediocre at ""best"".",Bumblebee

413,bigblack2009,"As I predicted, the only good part is the 5-minute part on Cybertron, the rest is boring Earth",1,21 December 2018,"They don't seem to get the fans at all. For years we complained that we did not want annoying humans around, we just want to see the giant robots punching each other and what do they give us instead? A movie that has even less action and more humans than the predecessors. Michael Bay knew better than listen to bloggers. The previous Transformers movies have action, big explosions, sex appeal, etc. Sometimes that's all an audience wants on a Friday night, especially boys. Because that's what Transformers is, a franchise for boys. And instead they tried to make this movies appeal to girls. The main character is a girl, the movie is more about the girl social struggles than action and war, the male characters are just sidekicks, even the villains are females, action is almost absent and special effects are 10 years behind the previous chapters.Transformers movies until TLK have been shovered with money. Like it or not, only the fans want to see more character development, story quality and world building. The avarage action fan is happy with what it is served to him: just look at Fast and Furious. TLK was a failure exactly because they tried to change approach. Ironically, an attempt to make Transformers more serious would only make the franchise less succesful. The success of the first Transformers movies was that they did not take themselves seriously. They were just explosions, beautiful girls barely dressed, racing cars, lot of swearing and CGI. What a teenage boy loves to see as Michael Bay said. What does Bumblebee does instead? It tries to appeal to an audience that doesn't exist, not for Transformers.",Bumblebee

And that is because, no matter how many people bash him on internet forums or blogs, everyone go to see his movies. You know why? Because they have everything one can ask for: big action, over-the-top spectaculars battles, stunning CGI, car-race at lightspeed, beautiful girls and women each time more undressed, a lot of street-fun and jokes, giant robots, giant monsters, sci-fi super weapons and aliens. What else can one want? Micheal is an enterteiner. He does not make thinking movies. He does not make movies that make you reflect on the sense of life. He make movie that entertein you. And he's the best at making it.This movie does the mistake to listen to those people and try to be less about action, less about special effects, less about Transformers. In fact this movie has literaly nothing that ring a Transformers bell. It's your avarage teenager meet fantastical creature story that it is actually focused all on teenagers emotive struggles and forget that this is ment to be an action movie for boys.

421,Skaigear,"A step-up from the last two, but its attempt of retreading Transformers 1 makes the film predictable",6,15 December 2018,"Bumblebee, directed by Travis Knight, is the sixth movie in the polarizing Transformers franchise. As a rare fan of the movies, I understand the trepidation people may have, but to me the first three films were great movies and still holds a special place in my heart (the last two however were completely horrendous and unnecessary). Needless to say, having the chance to see not just a new entry to the series, but one that is a throwback to better days earlier than anyone else made me super excited. The film takes the franchise back to the basics and feels very much like a remake of Transformers 1 but without the Michael Bay-ism that had the fan base much maligned. Gone are the lens flares, gratuitous female body shots and incomprehensible metal clanking action scenes. The new movie smartly knows the concept of addition via subtraction by streamlining everything; reducing the number of Transformers characters to four and focusing the heart of the story solely on Hailee Steinfeld and Bumblebee.The Last Knight almost made me walked out because the movie's over the top action scenes just became a chore to watch after a while. I am proud to report this new movie does not have the same chaotic shaky cam or quick cuts explosions, instead Knight favors visibility of the combatants in shots and allowing the audience to see what is going on. Yes, you can actually tell who is who this time! By far the best and most memorable thing in Bumblebee is that opening scene in Cybertron. It was fantastic and spectacularly faithful! Everything from the look of the planet to the robot designs and the choreography of the battle perfectly captures the original animated Transformers movie. Elongate that scene into a feature length film and that might just be the Transformers movie fans have been clamoring for. I also applaud Travis Knight for finally be able to make the robots feel like living breathing creatures, unlike the previous movies where they were a penny short from being soulless CGI with spotty voiceover.While there is a lot to like about the film, I cannot go on without mentioning some major flaws. My number one problem is this feels all way too familiar. The story is once again a kid needs a car, the kid finds the car who reveals itself to be Bumblebee and kid gets entangled with an ancient alien robot war. Transformers 1 with Shia LaBeouf is still very good movie that still holds up today, so I do not understand the need to retread the plot without a big shakeup. Hailee Steinfeld who plays Charlie is always a delight to watch as I loved her work since True Grit, but she has already played this role of the destructive, misunderstood, angsty teenager in The Edge of Seventeen before. Do we really need to see her repeat the performance again? Seeing Bumblebee as a talkative, sarcastic badass in the beginning and then seeing him cower in the corner like a child because the script demanded it was strange and jarring. I wish they had kept Bumblebee's voice as we the audience have already seen the cute and mute Bumblebee from the previous movies. This was a massive missed opportunity that could have separated itself from the first movie just a little bit more.Thankfully no racial stereotype robots exist in the movie (still love Revenge of the Fallen), some parts of Bumblebee felt like they were lifted straight out of a Disney Channel Original Movie, in particular any scenes involving John Cena who chews the scenery while pretending he is auditioning for The Pacifier 2. The cinematography does not help the Disney Channel Original Movie argument because outside of action scenes and some gorgeous exterior shots of the San Francisco Bay, the move looked rather pedestrian and flat. The music also was not at all memorable and the iconic Transformers theme from the Bay movies is sorely noticed and missed.Overall, Bumblebee is a step-up from Age of Extinction and The Last Knight with its simplification of plot, characters and action scenes, but its attempt of retreading Transformers 1 makes the film predictable and by-the-number. It is a still fun and enjoyable movie outside of problems I mentioned, so I would definitely recommend this to most people, even if it is just for the Cybertron scene alone.",Bumblebee
422,IronManu77,A movie with non-existent chemistry between the main characters...cringe worthy,1,1 January 2019,"I placed my confidence in this movie owing to the awesome first Transformers movie starring Megan Fox and Shia LeBeouff that came out several years ago. That movie was full of action, had comedy but above all the chemistry between the characters Bumblebee and the boy which felt genuine and touched the heart. There was an intimate connection between Shia LaBeouf and Megan Fox as well. That being said, I had no doubt that Bumblebee would be a great entertainment for the money only to be greatly disappointed by the disconnected troublesome characters and a protagonist teenage girl who is trying to connect with Bumblebee but does not quite connect entirely. Romance is non-existent and they try to force a chemistry between a boy and a girl that is worthy of cringing and also not a two way attraction either.",Bumblebee

426,roger_and_out,Is the nostalgia factor stronger than bad acting?,7,11 February 2019,"First thing that hit me, and it hit me hard, was the design of the Transformers. It was so true to their original cartoon/toy design that it struck a deep chord in me. Being able to recognize my childhood favorites (Soundwave, Cliffjumper, Optimus and the rest) really jump started my nostalgia sensitivities. Further on many popular 80s hits (as the movie is set in 1987) kept coming up which added to that, but that was only distracting enough to make a mediocre movie enjoyable.I'll leave it to Youtube essay fanatics to nitpick at every excruciating detail, I'll use broader strokes today.The coherence of the story is wildly inconsistent. A product of bad writing of course, but again, wildly inconsistent. Some parts seem well thought through, well written and constructed while others are severely cringe-inducing in their juvenile nature - especially the bonding scenes between Charlie and Bumblebee. In their scenes he's reduced from a heroic soldier (as seen in the beginning) to an idiotic, pathetic puppy like creature. Kind of like a huge, metal Gollum. Their scenes together felt weird and the base of their bond was inappropriately based on her personal loss, rather than experiencing something together. That direction forced a lot of dry exposition that completely detached from the rhythm of the movie. It kept going when the character of Memo was introduced. It became a full blown straight to DVD Disney special. A true cringe fest, and that's without even mentioning the ""humor"". How bad could it be, you ask? There's a scene where Bumblebee is TPing a tree and throwing eggs. During those scenes they completely lost me, and they kept going for a long while. A very... long... looooooong while.The music... *sigh* The use of pop songs was great, you can't go wrong with 80s music. However the soundtrack was awful. Most of it sounded like stock music that was downloaded for free. Cue ""dramatic-tension-38.mp3"", and now ""comedy-20.mp3"". This may be a small gripe to most, but it's a powerful mood setting tool most people are unaware of how much by which they're affected.Overall I enjoyed the movie, in spite of the difficult-to-watch the Disney moments. It felt like it was made by people who liked the Transformers as kids as well. As if they got the spirit of the original show, unlike Michael Bay who seemed to have hated the original show and tried to tarnish it as much as possible.",Bumblebee

This movie is rife with all of today's social topics, while disguising itself in a on 80's theme. They can play the music, wear the clothes, but the dialogue of today creeps in and spoils the recipe.

428,Reelnerd,BumbleBee Begins,8,30 December 2018,"Reel Nerd Review: BumbleBee
By Nelson Nantanapibul
Directed by Travis Knight
Starring, Hailee Steinfeld, Jorge Lendeborg Jr., John Cena
This film could be dubbed BumbleBee Begins as it is an origin tale of sorts of the ever popular Transformer and a prequel to the Michael Bay led franchise that has been losing steam as of late due to the last several films receiving a critical drubbing. The previous film in the franchise underperformed financially in comparison to prior installments grossing over a billion dollars per film globally.
I absolutely adored this film it had all the elements that I loved in the first (and best in the opinion of many critics) installment in the series. I stopped watching these films after the second installment despite being a big fan of the original animated series and toy line from the 80's. Hailee Steinfeld was a delight to watch on screen. She has such personality and charisma and exhibits great comedic and dramatic chops throughout the story.
She plays Charlie who struggles to get over the loss of her father and her new family dynamic at home after her mom remarries. She feels alone and isolated and her story very much parallels BumbleBee's story in the film who is far from home and separated from his fellow Autobots and on a dire mission bestowed upon him from Optimus Prime himself.
Both find each other after an extraordinary set of circumstances. Charlie thinks she has found herself her new dream car and brings her new VW Beetle home as a birthday present to herself. BumbleBee is battle damaged and has been lying dormant until Charlie by tinkering with her new car brings him back to operational mode.
BumbleBee unfortunately cannot fully remember who he is and what his mission is and adjusts to life on earth with Charlie's protective guidance. This film is set in the late 80's and there are some fun nods and references to the era without over saturating the film with nostalgia from the time period. I liked the choice of 80's pop tunes and and there is even an easter egg in the form of a song from the '87 animated Transformers film.
Charlie is very relatable and her relationship with her family along with BumbleBee and her next door neighbor Memo is at the heart of this film. It's a classic coming of age tale set in the world of the Transformers and it works. Think of this film as a hybrid of ET, Sixteen Candles and The Iron Giant.
It's a very sweet and heartfelt film that made my eyes a little bit misty from time to time due in part to Hailee's wonderful performance in the film. John Cena plays a military man on the hunt for BumbleBee and all of his kind and I must say he didn't give all that bad of a performance. I actually thought that he did a nice job of not making his character a complete cliche.
BumbleBee was a lot of fun and it was funny. There are some nice action sequences and it was a real kick to see the G1 designs of the Autobots and the Decepticons used in this film. Will this film serve as a means to reboot the franchise? Only time and the fan and box office reception this film receives will determine that. I highly recommend this film as someone who loved the OG transformers animated series and the first couple of films.",Bumblebee
429,StephenIsADumb,Really Pulls At Your Heart Strings,10,30 December 2018,This might be one of the cutest movies I have ever seen. The bond between Bumblebee and Charlie (Hailee Steinfeld) is incredible...especially considering he is CGI. It honestly feels like the live-action version of The Iron Giant so if you like that movie you will love this! Just make sure you bring some tissues lol 😂🖤,Bumblebee
430,fat3773,So stupid.,1,19 January 2019,"People were complaining about michael bays direction, but this movie definitely proved that no one can do a transformer movies better than michael bay. Chiao. 👎👎👎",Bumblebee
431,coldbutsocold,Loved it!!,10,19 January 2019,"Wow yes! Transformers done properly, respecting the original lore. It's not an ad for Chevy but instead they are entities that can ""scan"" a mechanical vehicle and merge with it/become it.And so so many funny and cute moments, the soundtrack is epic and it's such a great throwback to the 80's. Best movie hands down of 2019.It's cool and well enough made to be taken seriously but at the same time does not take itself too seriously - an absolute perfect balance in my opinion.SCREW PEDOWOOD, this is a proper movie and I bet the young cast members didn't get abused, like in so many hollywood productions we are now finding out about *cough* Spielberg *cough* ....",Bumblebee
432,sajib-66432,"Less is more ,its a Robot movie with full of emotions",8,26 December 2018,"This movie created more emotions inside Robot than what Michele Bay created inside Humans in his Transformer movies .Even the fights are better as its not 20 robot fighting & each fight lasting 30 seconds .You can feel the Bone crushing punches & kicks of each fights & it lasted long enough that you know enemy was way stronger than the typical Micheal Bay movie .You can feel for the good guys & even the bad guys have a character arc .After watching this movie i think its raised more emotions than many comic movies ,its really a movie which anyone can watch just as a movie not just as a Robot movie .I think i already miss the 80s style that this movie created ,the song selection the simple lifestyle is something this movie has portrayed perfectlyHave to give credit to John Cena .He really has perfect comic timing & he wasn't even joking mos of the time.Another best thing about this movie is not all jokes are about scripted lines .Main actress's little brother created the most epic laugh in theater when he wasn't even talking ,that shows how well the script is written & how well the actors portrayed that ,I think when Most Comic movies nowadays try to force feed jokes at that time this movie really created something different than other movies .I think after watching this movie i really want to watch the next sequel of this movie which didn't happen in Previous Michael Bay's Transformer movies .I think this is kind of movie which is a must watch in theater as the it looks really good in big screen .For adult or Kids boys/girls everybody has something in it",Bumblebee
433,rnelon,Terrible,2,20 April 2019,It seems like the writers and director never saw Transformers (cartoon 80s). They just put together something to satisfy the PC police. Absolutely terrible movie.,Bumblebee
434,maijita,A kids movie,4,21 May 2020,"This movie is so childish. The dialogue is cheesy, the acting is over dramatic, the story very simple and full of ridiculous plot holes, jokes are juvinile, and characters are so clishe and just not interesting. The only good thing I find is the CGI. I thought this would be decent since the 6.8 rating, but that rating is a ridiculous lie.",Bumblebee
435,cyraswest,Best Transformers movie in the span of 6 movies,8,15 January 2019,"I cannot believe how grounded this Transformers movie is, for once, it's not about saving the planet from other Transformers, and for once, it's not handled by Michael Bay. This movie is basically about a teenager dealing with family issues with Bumblebee in it, the leading character is not out-shined by the Transformers, plus a lot of stuff that she goes through is very relatable. The designs of Bumblebee, Optimus, Soundwave and Shockwave has a hint of nostalgia to it. The actors are very good, especially Hailee Steinfeld (She also did the credit song ""Back to life""). This is the best Transformers movie hands down, can all the movies prior to this be non- canon please?",Bumblebee

437,aneurysms,Well...,6,23 December 2018,"This film makes the same mistake as all live action Transformers live action films makes... It revolves around kids and humans. That is the worst parts of this film in particular. I grew up with the Transformers G1 and seeing them in their live action cgi was glorious! If only we could get a film like the first five minutes!Spoilers: The movie is basical a girl who is having a hard time dealing with her father's death. There is a diveristy check mark neighbor who is shy and useless. She works through her diving fear at the end (there was a pointless scene where she gets scared and can't dive... yawn). Did I mention this takes place in the 80's? Well the movie will remind you every 4 to 5 minutes or so in case you forget.The scenes with the Transformers on Cybertron were the best parts. Soundwave releasing Ravage and Shockwave in action... Starscream and the seekers... amazing! But when they are on Earth, yawn. John Cena was actually very good in this, that was a major plus.Overall, I wanted more Transformers in a live action Transformer film, yet was stuck with faux 80's teens. There will be a sequel (hopefully about Optimus Prime) and hopefully we will actually get Transformers. Not a bad film, good for kids",Bumblebee
438,bournejackal,A transformer movie you can enjoy,7,17 December 2019,"Hate being bored with nothing to do. I was going through @hulu and found the movie Bumblebee. Was going to see it last year, but I couldn't because of my surgery. The movie Bumblebee is a origin story. This movie is a fun, entertaining ride. @haileesteinfeld does a great job in this role. Also @johncena was pretty good . The characters were fun. Loved the 80's theme. Especially the music. The storyline was better than the last 2 transformer movies. If you are a fan of the Transformers, you will enjoy this movie. This is a movie for the whole family. Hopefully they will do a sequel.

It was getting worser and worser every films they 've been produced so far. And i dont even know what was their story anymore.
Ok, let's go back to the main point. Bumblebee movie was good. Not too much action seen but got some storyline here. And somehow i got my connection to transformers franchise again. The same chilled i got from the first transformers you know. And it worked on bumblebee.
This movie was generally good. Not too much action scene but perfect when i happened. More emotional bone between autobots and humans. The only character that standed out was Charlie, sorry i dont know her real name when i was typing this, and the rest were just good enough.
Thank you Travis and the team for 2 wonderful hours.",Bumblebee
442,pthef,A Delightful Surprise,8,2 January 2019,"Took my son to see this yesterday because he wanted to see it and I figured it would get me out of the house for a couple of hours. I was delighted with this movie, as I didn't expect to be. It is sci-fi action-adventure and does this quite well, which was not unexpected. But it was also charming and a great musical retrospective of the '80s. Bumblebee was something between an exuberant puppy and a mischievous little boy, as his human, a girl named Charlie, a tomboy and gear-head of a girl, is assisted through her grief in the love and caring they give to one another. The movie delighted us, and we took my wife tonight to see it again, and she was likewise charmed. Don't miss this movie. Bumblebee set the bar for the Transformers movies to follow!",Bumblebee

Unfortunately it is lacking in both areas.Since Iron Giant exists, why even bother with Bumblebee?",Bumblebee
451,dvoon-missy-mcmuffin,A girl and her pet - with hearts all over.,8,14 December 2018,"Being an 80s kid and having grown up watching the original Transformers, I must say that this recent Bumblebee film is very reminiscent to the G1 era. However for me, the original Transformers film in 2007 holds a very special place - as it was the very first live-action film that depicted them on the big screen. I remembered feeling so elated, seeing them then for the very first time after so long. Unfortunately for all of us, we know how that went with every subsequent sequels after that, the Transformers live-action film franchise could not sustain themselves in terms of storytelling. It was still a spectacle though. Sigh...So...where does Bumblebee stand? As a film, as a story - it is very enjoyable. It reminds me of ET, Batteries Not Included or any other types of story about a girl and her pet dog etc. Ala the coming of age type of stories. Ones that makes you feel good, and knows how to pull on your heartstrings during tender moments. Hailee Steinfeld is incredible - charismatic and unbelievably talented, being our anchor for us to feel what she feels - does one hell of a job. This is definitely her story, as she carries this film on her prowess.Other than her, there are some characters that I can do without. As they are very reminiscent about the recent tropes, humor, trends in recent movies that reminds me of the 2007-2017 era of the franchise.Besides the human aspects - how about the Transformers themselves? Well...they are good, mostly great, to a certain point of give or take.For the great - the Decepticons here finally showcase personalities just like the cartoons. They are no more mindless, all silvery husk of parts, just for cannon fodder like those of their 2007-2017 predecessors. That's the great thing about it for me. I really hope that they can sustain this aspect for the future of the franchise. Seeing the Decepticons as characters after oh so long, instead of one-liner spewing piece of furniture is a welcome betterment.As for the good - Bumblebee is good. Or at times even great as he is animated so convincingly almost like a lost puppy of some kind. However, he is still that Bumblebee that we know from its past predecessors - which somehow makes me wish that this film should had been a whole new start instead of a er...""soft reboot""??? Ahh well...at least for the most parts of the movie, I found him good enough. Except for one scene that happens entirely in the house. It became very slapsticky (that's just me).And finally to that certain point of give or take - hmm...how should I put this? Film opens on Cybertron. The wow factor is definitely there. We see The Autobots, and The Decepticons. Finally. No humans. Great. Yes...it is very nice to see the G1 designs...however...as that opening scene progresses, it somehow makes me feel as if I was watching an in-game-cinematic instead of a live-action film. Why? Because of the absence of human or any natural or realistic stuff to ground them in. It felt as if I was watching Fall of Cybertron game cinematic after awhile with all those easter eggs galore and such. But when the scene finally shifted to Earth, with natural elements as a point of reference, Bumblebee became very much believably realistic.And the reveal of Optimus Prime during Cybertron scene - somehow also felt lackluster (probably because we have seen Prime for the last 10 years in the 2007-2017 franchise). That magic was gone. I recall seeing Prime for that very first time in 2007 gave me goosebumps then (sigh).So...that's my take. Having just caught a preview of the film...it is still a great, good film, to a certain point (for me at least) - I had a blast and I did laugh out loud too. Have fun watching it for yourselves. Cheers...",Bumblebee
452,tasev1,"A fun, no fuss, old-school movie.",8,29 December 2018,"If you used to enjoy old 80's action movies, adventures, sci-fi romps, and the tropes that come with them then you will have fun with Bumblebee.The movie sets itself in the 80's and doesn't hide the fact that it's origins is a cartoon - so those two things combined is what actually makes this movie such a classic joy to watch. Even the ridiculous military personnel and scientists can be forgiven when you realize where that ridiculousness comes from.This is a simple, fun story, where you care about the characters and actually like them. Despite the stereotypical villains and 80's tropes, the girl is anything but stereotypical. She's likeable, vulnerable, and she fights when there's something to latch on to. None of this super-hot-supermodel bullcrap. Even the ending shoved a finger in the typical man-woman action movie ending, and I loved that.",Bumblebee

Yet, they still take our money and give us trash. FORTUNATELY, Bumblebee isn't that film that suffers for overstuffed, overcooked and underperformed warzone fight scenes, clunky plot holes, or bad acting. Bumblebee stole my heart as it nods itself to the first Transformer's film in many ways that one, but with a bit more story and character development that started the billion dollar movie franchise. I deeply enjoyed how the movie was set in the mid to late 80s, which even me, as a 90s baby believe was the best era of both movies, music, AND fashion. This movie is just the right start of a new trilogy or series of films that lead into the very first live action film. Everything about it is JUST right. Don't expect too much though. We're not talking about prophecies or some weird past that forces the main protagonist to travel across the entire world to find answers, NO, Bumblebee has one mission and one mission only. And in this film, there's nothing better than a straight forward storyline that doesn't confuse us at the end of the film.

Well, news flash Bay basically did direct it without directing it he handpicked his replacement who is pretty much his protégé. The film is just like any other Micheal Bay movie FUN, STUPID, and full of EXPLOSIONS! However, I do feel like the writing was stronger in this film at least it was more story-driven than the previous Transformers movies. I thought it was a weird choice to have Halie Sienfield in this but she was great. Her performance was both strong and adorable mixed together which also sums up this movie. And of course, before I finish this review I have to address John Cena's performance or my headline won't make since (You can't see me) ok anyway Cena actually left me wanting to see more of his character.

The design of the transformers is great,It's simple look alike to the animation series counterpart.The story is also great.Now,Let's talk about minority about this.
First of all i need to know
""Is this a standalone movie? Or a part of the previous universe?""
Because if it is part of previous universe,The time relevant is the problem.First in scene when""Sector 7""is introduced in this movie(Or mentioned as i can remember).
I only ask one thing
""Where is MEGATRON?""
As long as we can remember,Megatron crashed on earth million years ago in arctic,Later he was founded by Archibald Witwicky and later again founded and brought to the facility by""Sector 7.""
If this movie set place in 1980's,Well at least they've found megatron and we can see him frozen in the facility.Second,In the first transformers movie,Optimus and the rest of autobot except bumblebee is land on earth right after they met with Sam.But in this movie,Optimus can be seen on earth right after be departed with Charlie,I mean how is that possible?Yet,This movie is also lack of fighting scenes,
So if you want to saw some Transformers fighting scene,Don't look for it in this movie.Overall,This is a good movie about relationship between human and bumblebee, but lack of action scenes that pumping tension.",Bumblebee

First is a relatively simple story that can be followed without getting an epileptic attack. The fight scenes and transitions are clear and crisp. Bumblebee is the Transformer with the biggest sense of humor and connects best with humans. Great choice for the main character. Second plus is the acting, Hailee does a fantastic job in creating a believable person with depth and emotions. Although the movie is called Bumblebee, Hailee is the real star.

471,samhendersonthemovieman,The best Transformers movie since the first one!,9,31 August 2020,"Let me start by saying that the Transformers series wasn't very great. It was okay. You know, it started off good with the first one, but then it gone to mediocre to okay sequels like Revenge of the Fallen, Dark of the Moon, Age of Extinction, and The Last Knight. The first five were all directed by Michael Bay. I wouldn't say that he's a bad director. He's an okay one, definitely not one of my favorite filmmakers. I mean, he made a few movies that I like like the first Transformers, The Island, and Armageddon. I was a bit hopeful that Bumblebee will revive the series. But boy, did it deliver! Like the other movies in the series, the visuals are amazing and colorful. Hailee Steinfeld delivered a lovely and wonderful performance. The story and writing is more well written than the other ones. The camera work is more well handled than the other movies in the series. In the other movies, The camera work was a little shaky. The tone is much more lighter than the other ones. It also had a good amount of action, humor, and heart throughout. The action had less explosions than any of the previous movies. The soundtrack that was featured in it was amazing and had a nostalgic feeling like the soundtrack in Guardians of the Galaxy. The directing from Travis Knight was well handled. The 80s settings makes you fell like you were in the 80s. The relationship between Hailee Steinfeld and Bumblebee is really well done and cute. All in all, Bumblebee is the best Transformers movie since the first one. It had revived the franchise and hopefully will get better later on like Fast & Furious and Mission: Impossible.",Bumblebee
472,cyberperro,Honarary Breakfast Club Member,9,23 December 2018,"This movie has so much heart. Perfect mix of nostalgic 80s era songs, references and vibe; and a softer feel of a relationship between B and his new companion.

475,imdb-8212,"If you liked the 1980's cartoon series, you'll love seeing a REAL Transformers movie.",7,6 April 2019,"Like others have said, so many times in the past we've seen transformers movies with good action and decent CGI, but the storyline ignored the history of The Transformers from the 1980s.This story picks up where Bumblebee left Cybertron and DOES do a little re-telling, but the main idea (and the main characters) are left as they were, albeit with Bumblebee's lack of a voicebox like previous movies. If you liked the series though, you will LOVE seeing your old favorites acting like they used to. Soundwave looks like himself, Ravage fits where he belongs, and Shockwave has the distinctive voice.So many things bring back those fond childhood memories! The only sad part of the show is the human actors. They cast the absolute wrong people for this show and I think they knew it, but just kept them because the female lead is the hot new thing with the pre-teens right now, and they tied her up to a fuzzy headed no-acting nerd-creature that can barely string a sentence together.While it's still an enjoyable movie, it isn't everything it could have been.",Bumblebee
476,haydenagain,Finally. The Transformers movie that truly is More Than Meets The Eye!,9,28 January 2019,"Transform and roll-out robot fans in disguise as we have a new and exciting review on our hands, Bumblebee. A lot of internet speculation has gone into this films expectations, now let's see if this film is up to the test.PlotBumblebee is set in the early 1980's, the same time-period where the Transformers toy line first originated. The Autobots on Cybertron are nearing ultimate defeat at the hands of the evil Decepticons. Their last hope of survival now rests upon Autobot B127 (Codename Bumblebee) as he voyages to Earth only to be discovered by teenager Charlie Watson in San Francisco. After losing his vocal processors upon arrival, Bumblebee must learn to adapt in order for him to survive on Earth, protect Charlie and evade pursuing Decepticon Hunters along the way.LikesBumblebee is an evolutionary origin story for the mute Autobot like no other. Unlike previous director Michael Bay, best known for his films overuse of explosions, military involvement, bland character development, Grotesque slow-motion, product placement and reuse of scenes, debuting director Travis Knight brings to life a film that replaces all of the above with a calmer new atmosphere.First off, there is no Mark Wahlberg Horray! Secondly, the films tone is for the first time well balanced and not shifting from being too grim or to being too stupid in two seconds flat. This is a much sunnier tone that the Transformers films can work with.The special effects and CGI are mind-blowing and greatly well-polished. Especially the Transformers designs overall. Love the revived Generation One looks. And I love that the film has more to do with the Transformers side of the story than just wasting 3 hours on a revoltingly poor human plotline in most of the sequels. Where it gives us more insight into the Autobots daring battle for salvation than just leaving them as King Kong/Godzilla Stand-ins.
The action and cinematography is fresh, clean and expertly filmed. Going from explosive firefights to true Transformer Clash of the Titan's/ Mortal Kombat style fights.Speaking of the human characters. They aren't as much too involved in the plot and don't possess that many annoying or aggravating personality's such as *cough!* Marky Mark *cough!* *cough!* and are much diverse and developed. Even removing a few ethnic stereotypes in the process.
The female human lead Charlie Watson (Hailee Steinfeild) is a gorgeously well-developed character with a relatable motivation and a good-natured spirit. And I like how well the character bonds so well with Bumblebee without Male dominancy getting in the way of it. I would even say that her character in general is a much more likable character than that of Sam Witwicky (Shia Labeouf) and Cade Yeagar (Mark Wahlberg) combined. And of course her friend and possible love-interest Memo was also quite a fun-loving character all the same.And surprisingly Wrestling Legend John Cena as Agent Burns was a good human antagonist. At first I thought he was going to be my most hated character in this film. But actually his character is much more than that and does have a normal human ambition of fearing what he doesn't truly understand.At long last, the Transformers characters. First off I like how Bumblebee finally gets some more much needed character development in this film than he ever had before. We finally get to know how he lost his voice and what he had to go through to adopt this Radio Tuning voice that we hear him using in the first Transformers film. And his relationship building with Charlie was very well-written in. And the return of G1 Designs for the other transformers, oh yes! How I've missed seeing The Transformers G1 indeed.I like how the film overall keeps close to the Transformers source-material and how they brought back some of the 80's theme that made the franchise a joy to remember.DislikesAs with every Transformers film, there will always be something to despise about them. Luckily for us this time, Bumblebee's problems are minimal as those of previous Transformers Sequels (E.G. Age of Extinction & The Last knight).The humour in generally is exceptionally good, but can somewhat get a bit iffy up and down in many places. Such as John Cena repeatedly shooting a man in the face with a paintball gun for instance which would cause a lot of harm in real life. And trust me, paintballs HURT the most in the head and I know. That's probably my biggest gripe with the humour on that bombshell, but let's be honest, I'd rather be seeing that than watching the Bee ""Lubricating"" upon a helpless individual such as Seymour Simmons.Transformer deaths and a few action sequences are a bit overkill (not that Bumblebee had much of a choice in the matter though). Such as a few huge unrealistic explosions happening every time Bumblebee uses his Cannon, and when he kills some Decepticons such as Starscream and Dropkick. Of course, Mister Explosive himself was still producing so we probably should've been aware of that anyway. Lucky for us, the explosions aren't too present and glorified as often as before, so don't panic.But overall, the dislikes for Bumblebee are the smallest that I have ever seen in Transformers for a long, long time.VerdictSeveral years of wacky, inescapably bad entries into a hugely divisive film series. Held responsible for almost killing the Transformers toyline altogether. Bumblebee is that long-awaited antidote to cure the Transformers of that humiliation. The Bumblebee stays true to the Transformers lore while offering clean honest fun, excitement, simple story and pacing, dazzling effects, character building, rip-roaring action and high octane suspense that makes Bumblebee the ultimate come-back film of the entire decade!
And to end this review on a high note, I personally want to thank Travis Knight for giving me, Transformers fans and 80's fans alike exactly what we wanted.I give Bumblebee 8½/10.",Bumblebee

I didn't know that John Cena would be so good in this movie. He was quite funny. Hailee Steinfield really gives a great performance of an estranged teen trying to find herself. And the legendary, Peter Cullen, is of course at his best as Optimus Prime. Bumblebee is a really good family-entertainer. He shows emotion, humor, and courage. This is why Bumblebee is my favorite Transformer. The design for this movie is very top notch. Not hating on Michael Bay's Transformers series but this was honestly better. This is finally a good Transformers movie we have wanted for so long and this goes back to the roots of the original Transformers.

Beginning on Cybertron was awesome. Hope that next one will be good as this one, and I kinda hope this is the beginning of a whole new story since at the end Bumblebee joins Optimus, and in Bay's movies, if I remember well, Optumus' first time on Earth was in 21st century, and here it was at the end of the '80s.",Bumblebee
485,rostsit,"Stupidity, retcons and inconsistency",5,1 January 2020,"I admit I've tried to watch this as a separate film, more or less independent from the main franchise.
But it turned out to be impossible task.
Everything starts just in the beginning of the movie, when Prime tasks Bee with traveling to Earth, which he ""found"". His words completely retcons the whole story, but I could live with it, if not for Bumblebee transforming from the COMMON HUMAN CAR just a seconds before this conversation! It all goes downhill from this moment. Total ignorance of well established facts, as well as the scenario being written for 5-years-olds. Again, I could live with alien robots speaking English among themselves while not even being on Earth. But one can only facepalm seeing Decepticons transmitting message for their army even WRITTEN in English.

Many scenes are the same, especially to the first Transformer.So I guess the main idea about Bumblebee was just to make a movie about an little twittish autobot ""Baby"" and copy somehow the story.If you like to watch an funny and smart movie about Volkswagen Beetle, please watch ""The Love Bug"", its miles better!",Bumblebee

489,amrittamang,"Difficult start, good middle, promising end",6,22 March 2019,"Spoilers ahead!I get the idea that it is expensive to actually design a transformers character and that it may appear too much to develop one just for a few minutes. However, there are quite a few characters that only show up for seconds. Thus, I would assume that it is in the budget to develop an important character even if he should show up only for short.Even in the old cartoon the transformers looked differently before they came to earth. This is because none of then has ever been to earth. Why then do we have to see an Optimus Prime and a Bumblebee on Cybertron in their earth-truck and earth-car incarnations? It makes absolutely no sense. It is a huge logic flaw. That is absolutely not okay especially because the story is simple.Take another simple story: Avatar. The story is simple but the logic is coherent. A simple story needs to divert from this fact through immersion. If there are flaws in the logic of the story or its presentation, then it will distract and pull the audience out of the movie. In the transformers meta-narrative, i.e. universe, a transformer usually needs to gaze upon an object before he imitates it.The movie depicts many transformers who already are in their earth-vehicle-shape before they had a chance to scan it. WTF? Don't you care? That much disrespect towards the audience. What were the makers thinking? Was it: oh, the audience is so stupid. They won't notice. Simply flash them with some action and it will not matter.That is not okay and does not fit the rest of the movie. If one spends so much money on making such a movie, such mistakes should not happen.An active effort to stay ignorant towards this nonsense made it possible for me to enjoy the rest of the movie. I also rate it quite well because I like the franchise and it needed some support after that last tragedy of Transformers movie. If one spends so much time and money to make a three hours movie one should definitely avoid making utter crap. That has not worked with the last movie. One cannot simply take bits of stories and just randomly put them together.This movie has an actual story. It is not as crazily fast paced as the first one and there is more space for the bonding of a transformer with an earthling. I don't care that it is essentially the same story as the first live-action transformers movie. It references the eighties and as such the origin of the transformers.",Bumblebee

Dir: Travis Knight
Runtime: 1 hr 54 minSynopsis: On the run in the year 1987, Bumblebee the autobot seeks refuge in a junkyard in a small California beach town. Charlie, on the brink of 18 years old and trying to find her place in the world, soon discovers the battle scarred and broken Bumblebee.I've been slacking on my reviews obviously. But I didn't want to leave any of them out so I'll start with this one and see if I can make some progress. This film is like one of those films that after the previous they make a really good one and redeem themselves but now your wishing the previous films were done the same way. I'll admit I'm still a fan of the first three Transformers films although not liked by many. The story itself was pretty straight forward no plot twists that dramatically change the course of the film. I do feel like it becomes dry halfway through considering they are trying to fit a new character Charlie and her origin story in alongside Bumblebee's origin story. I mean that's the purpose of the film right everyone wants to see the giant robot so cool stuff. The camera shots while highly similar to Michael Bay's extreme action films had their own take. I don't want to say that the Transformers ""looked"" better beside the fact that they are in their original forms, example: Optimus Prime while on Cybertron. And Starscream. But they looked more authentic if that makes sense. While in the older films they have this very metallic look to them, in ""Bumblebee"" they actually looked like vehicles and planes once transformed into robot form. The character themselves were fantastic, you get a real backstory as to why Bumblebee can't speak and how he learns to use the radio to communicate. My favorite part of the whole film was probably the very end which leads directly into the first Transformers film. Strongly disliked that I didn't get a tiny bit more Transformers in the film. I get it yea Bumblebee it's his story but seeing the others in their original form was awesome. Towards the end of the film I did spot a huge plot hole which with a little rewatch of the first film it could have been corrected. Def a theatre watch for the sound and big picture and def a buy at least for me.my only real complaint is that plot hole.",Bumblebee

Aside from continuity issues with bayformers this film was really good with heart and a followable story.This film also makes me really bummed that they didn't use the transformers design until this film. All the transformers looked great in this film. Especially optimus prime.Also bummed that paramount didn't turn to this film making team until this one.

You get a real sense the writer has a distaste for men and wants to show it at every given opportunity. The 80s references were ok, but there was far too much of a Smiths obsession going on and it really grated the more references they threw at you.The sentimentality didn't really hit home for me and neither seemed that bothered to say goodbye. Also loved the non-consensual handholding at the end - did it really need that in there?Action-wise, you get some at the start and a great finale and they are by far the best sequences that have been done for a Transformers film simply because you can see whats going on.Wait for rental on this.",Bumblebee

Is true, this movie is not one of the best movie of all time, but is BY FAR, the BEST TRANSFORMER MOVIE EVER!!!! 2 things make this the best: First we got an adorable Bumblebee. Is so easy to connect with him and to actually feel his emotions: The fear when he was attacked by those army´s guys, the happiness when he found love in the human girl, the playfulness when he is smashing that car. The second was the way they portray the others Autobots and Decepticons. They stick to the comics and cartoon´s series. You can actually see their emotions.
Maybe in the sci-fi and special effects departments this movie is behind some of the Michael Bay´s Universe but Transformers is not about that. Is about discovery and emphaty and wondering about new worlds and new people. COME ON!!!, these days we need so much movies with those feelings. So if you are reading this and don´t know if this movie is worthy, I can say that if you are looking to bring back to life some good old memories and feelings then this movie is for you.

514,filmexperienced,Buzzing,8,20 January 2019,"Lauded by many as the least 'Transformery' of the live-action Transformers movie, this comment only serves to identify how the brand has become synonymous with the Michael Bay school of film-making. Instead, this movie is really the most 'Transformery' in that it most accurately embodies the spirit of the original Generation 1 Transformers comics / cartoons. From entirely CGI and heavily robotic (i.e. it's a whole planet full of them) opening, which updates and makes excellent use of the 'Arrival from Cybertron' mythos to put the central characters perspective, history and motivations centre stage before having everyone and everything crash, literally, to earth. Sidekick Hailee Steinfield poaches the best part of her charm and performance from The Edge of Seventeen and Pitch Perfect 2 as she stands in for the Witwickys of the world with her new car / machine dog. The fairly forgettable plot whizzes by propelled by a great selection of 80's tunes to go with the other retro stylings, but enjoyment is found in the relationship between men and machines, be that Bumblebee and Charlie, or the smarter than usual Decepticons - who despite at least one character pointing out the implications of their name do a great job of being both smart, and menacing. But it's the details that are the icing on the cake - from the focus on the transformations themselves as disguise, to the Bay inverting almost car crash that shows the humour and sense of fun that Travis Knight has managed to re-inject into this franchise - a beating heart beneath the metal exterior.",Bumblebee

Excuse, wasn't the friend zoned guy cheesy enough for you? Or do we just ignore that because M.Bay didn't direct the film? I don't understand.And John Cena. Seriously? He made the whole thing look like a B Movie. Cena has no place in films like that.Overall it was a good film. I enjoyed it as much as all other Transformers movies. Age of Extinction and The Last Knight are still my favourites though.I hope they make more of them because this spinoff film is obviously experimental to establish a new beginning of the franchise and give us more movies in the future.",Bumblebee

The amazing visuals of cybertron really show the evolution of the transformers as a franchise with so much more to offer. Unfortunately the film is let down only by a weak and predictable story that loses all its momentum after about 30 mins or so. Good for a time waste, but don't expect anything other than a visual treat. We've seen this film countless times, just a shame a newer and more original concept couldn't be fleshed out without simply a gender swap of the main character and an ethnic minority love interest.

523,stop_thebeat,It had promise,5,13 February 2021,"This could've been a really decent Transformers film but it was full of negative tropes that really don't belong in cinema as we should be more progressive nowadays.
Good having another girl mechanic who wasn't relying on her looks and body to fill out her character. Charlie was quite likeable and having to remind myself she was 18 so prone to be moody etc. But the dead dad thing is so old, & to assume that the mother wouldn't have sat down with her children to explain her moving on with a new man & he's not replacing your father etc etc is ridiculous.
Unresolved daddy issues scored 0 points in this film.
Good 80's soundtrack and wardrobe.
So the elephants in the room they hinted at a romance but weren't they brave enough to have a have an 'interracial' couple kissing onscreen. It's not the 1950's! Guaranteed if that was a white guy lead they'll have had their tongues down each others throats foe the second half of the film. And having the only two black actors placed as comic relief was lazy and insulting.
On the upside it was awesome seeing proper Optimus Prime as a wagon and as a transformer robot. I never took to the newer design of him. Looked too much like a limo my ride.
If they'd left negative Hollywood stereotypes at the door and created something interesting and relatable I'd have scored it higher.",Bumblebee

Why are transformers on original cybertron transformed into earth vehicles?
How is Bumblebee apparently able to completely heal himelf, even from the most severe damage, yet his audio synthesis is permanently damaged and his car radio needs to be manually fixed by a girl?Such logical offenses prevent this from truly setting a solid landmark for the reboot of the franchise which is a shame because the movie has quite a bit of charm (save for John Cena's awfully cliched and bland character)",Bumblebee

The great opening scene, the awesome 80s hits through out and the original design of the look of the Transformers. Annnnd that's it. But adding that to this film is like adding garlic salt to rotten eggs. Its still gonna be crap.The movie is called Bumblebee, but like all the other films, the humans steal the movie from what we all wanna see. And we just wanna see the Transformers. There's is very, VERY little action in this film, and the story is a carbon copy of ET. The action is poor, the characters are cliched, and the overall film is boring. Plus the Deceptions are ridiculous. There's just two of them, and because they're not popular names, you know they're gonna die. And as mentioned, theres 80s hits throughout bit they are placed in way too often, and even then its only a few seconds of a song then it moves right on to another. It gets annoying real fast.I'm really tired of watching the trailers of these films. They only show the best parts. Even though Michael Bay isn't directing this one, its not an improvement. The next director needs to watch the first scene of this movie and just make an entire film based on that. On Cybertron, with zero humans.Save your money.",Bumblebee

There is just no real world stakes here, the plot doesn't try to bring the audience with it to understand the importance of bumblebee and main villains are ants compared to the legends we know from the earlier films like Star Scream or Sentinel Prime. Instead of a movie that focuses on developing Bee's character from the earlier films, we get a movie about a teenager getting bullied and discovering her first romance in a story that everyone's seen a million times before.

He goes the traditional way for this with all of 80's nostalgia thrown in plus all the Easter eggs hidden throughout the movie made me a huge smile ( to the ears literally).
For me personally, I really enjoyed the original one a lot.It had so much going on throughout the movie but this one has a lot of focus on it's center characters which make the heart and soul of the story (Just like Deadpool did back in 2016). Although it doesn't have that awe factor of seeing the humongous robots for the first time, it still manages to impress us with it's heartwarming character moments which have been thrown in the background for almost of the previous ones.
The movie shines in making us care for the characters for the first time since the original back in 2007 ( Best of Bay's work in the franchise so far). With Hailee Steinfeld in the lead, We actually fall for their bond right away for she brings all the warmth and endearment to the center plot. There are some genuine tender moments to treasure throughout the movie. Hailee has that lonesomeness to her character to which we all could relate to. Her and Bumblebee both complete each other in some sense.
Although We've seen this concept a million times before but this is among the best (With E.T, Stranger Things, Big Hero 6 to name a few).
It may not have those action packed moments from Bay's films albeit has some human moments which do quench that thirst for action up to some extent. My only gripe with the movie is that it has very few transformers to Awe about and even less action set pieces to take your breath away but then again, it wasn't going for that either.
I highly recommend this love letter from Travis Knight to Transformers fans who had too much Bay-niac to say the least. Go see this on the biggest screens in a theater near you for this sole Bumblebee outing ( May be a sequel is already on cards) for the last time.",Bumblebee

535,starcrowq3,Better then the others,6,23 January 2019,"This movie eventho it's a Transformers movie felt like it has more incommon and shares alot of it's plot with the classic E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. And that doesnt mean it's bad, but it's more of a family movie then it's siblings.
And the intro scenes are by far the best i've seen in a Transformer movie. Not because of the CGI but because it takes you back to the original Transformer series with it's design. This is more in line with what I think the other Transformers movies should have gone for.
The main female actress does a good job, and so does Bumblebee. Full of emotions of course to grab the viewers, otherwise it's what you can expect from a more childfriendly Transformers movie. I gave it a 6 out of 10 because eventho it's an ok movie, I felt like I had seen the same story played out over and over again. I also think if you like this movie you should watch and like Real Steel with Hugh Jackman. That's a movie that feels more original then this does.

This movie was all over the place. No consistency. The plot was terrible because it wouldn't focus on one thing. It was extremely cheesy. It was forced way too much In order to be realistic but it kept loosing its point. The jokes were pointless and overwhelming. The girl's family was trying to be funny and it seriously kept loosing me. It was like watching a cheap comedy. I seriously regret spending 2 hours watching this nonsense.

Yes, it's very kids-movie-esque, and the rating does hold a lot of these titles back, but nevertheless I actually enjoyed Bumblebee.Admittedly, a lot of what happens in the film is predictable and there are quite a few cheap/cheesy moments, but the cast and cinematography are phenomenal, as are the action sequences. No offence to Michael Bay, but apparently as soon as he took a step back the franchise seems to have gained momentum (in the right direction, too!) so credit where it's due.Overall, Bumblebee is a very enjoyable (albeit somewhat predictable) piece, which I highly recommend you watch in a cinema because it's very visually appealing.

538,MesoMorph,Great strengths in old school kid-centered plot,8,27 July 2019,"""the gold incense altar, and the gold statue of a chariot for the winged creatures which were on the lid of the sacred chest."" - Chronicles I 28:18I have no doubt in my mind that this Movie tops any transformers movie that came before it. From the first minute of watching it, and seeing how all the Autobots have regained their Gen1 look, made me feel like the people behind the scenes really know what the people want to see. The Autobots design always bothered me because since the first Transformers in 2007, the Autobots and Decepticons looked less like toys that can speak and more like trash-piles that can walk. In this new redesign, the look of Bumblebee as a full plated sentient machine-like-creature has enough depth to it to feel like it's not only there but it is also the ACTUAL bumblebee and not a Michael Bay explosion-toy.
Also the cast has been great. Hailee Steinfeld makes for a great rebellious teen, does not top her role in True Grit but she brings a whole lot to the role which have been wasted with less competent actresses. John Cena is highly likable in a role that shifts from fun-luvin soldier to tough military-man with fine comedic timing, almost makes me want to see his next comedy gig.
The filth of Bayism is washing away from the Transformers franchise which has been illuminated in Bumblebee (2018) by a heartwarming combo of Christina Hodson and Travis Knight. A pair that always ""had the touch"", and now ""had the power""

She undoubtedly is better than Shia LaBeouf and makes Mark Wahlberg look like a D-list actor.Travis Knight is no Michael Bay, and you can tell that early on in the film. Travis makes Bumblebee an actual character with a story that is worth buying a ticket for. Knight also makes the movie the shortest in the Transformers franchise, which is a good thing. The shorter runtime helped the film not feel dragged on with unnecessary scenes. To wrap it all up, the fight scenes are fantastic and make Bumblebee look like a total badass.

And, yes, while it is better than a Bay movie (as all movies are) with its determined Less Is More approach it itself looks rather like a TV movie with expensive special effects.
To me it felt like watching those ""little girl on an adventure"" movies like ""Andre"" and ""Monkey Trouble"" where girl befriends an animal (usually as a secret) which seems to exhilarate the people because it is after all a ""Transformers movie"".
On its own the movie is rather insignificant, but because previous movies were so sexist and incoherent people see it as a redemption toward what they did to women and storytelling, that we must applaud them now for not treating women as bimbos and actually having a coherent story.

But when you demonize a group like this, it diminishes any honest points you tried to bring across... However, they didn't totally fumble that eliment; which brought my review from a 7 to an 8.I'm sad that we probably won't get to see anymore of Hailee Steinfeld's character (who knows?)... but this film renews my hope for such Transformer films in the future...Brovo!

There are a lot of scenes here that could've been cut and replaced with scenes that would actually matter, like memo(the male support actor). He is unfunny and distracts the viewers from the actual 'heart of the story' which is again the relationship of Bee and Charlie. A proof of how utterly disposable this character is for the plot is that before the final confrontation he volunteers to be left behind which is pointless as you would see if you've watched the movie.

As in, what if a Transformers film was written with adolescent girls in mind, instead of adolescent boys and young men. I liked that the film takes us back to the Transformers of yesteryear, as seen in the animated series, and the backstory to Bumblebee was cool as well. My complaints however, are the poorly timed, often inappropriate soundtrack, cheesy writing/acting (John Cena? Seriously?) and most annoying... The overly emotional script. After a great first 20 minutes or so, the film devolves into an E.T/Herbie hybrid, clearly geared towards young women, to the point I felt like I was watching a ""chick flick"". Bumblebee goes from being a kick-ass warrior, to a cowering ""lost puppy"" doing stupid pet tricks. It's touching, it's sweet, and while OK in small doses, it's way over done, to the point most guys will feel they're in the wrong theater.
While it could be argued that the original series was overly sexualized, and a little over-the-top with explosions... This film is a drastic over-correction.

This is not a transformers movie, it is a story of an average American sulky teen of semi broken family juxtaposed over alien battle schemes. Painfully repetitive, full of cliched emotions and abundance of bland actors so repulsive, I am thinking why I did not walk out. Average DOP and even worse Editing. Now the reason it got 4 stars : 1) Good fighting choreography 2) Set design and production design very well done. 3) The transformation of the Bumblebee was very well worked on. TWo stars for that.

566,noelleinc,Such a waste of time,4,28 December 2018,"This movie was terrible. The pacing was slow, there was no story to fill in the time, just a bunch of driving around. The family scenes were forced and I felt no connection at all to any of the characters. The love interest was incredibly lame. John Cena's character was one of a typical dumb soldier, I much prefer all of the military characters from the first movie to him. At least they were funny. Not senseless shells of dumb.Bumblebee was cute, like a kitten, not the badass Transformer he's been in the past movies. The action scenes were typical and boring. Honestly the best part of the movie was the first 10 minutes. After that it was not fun, funny or even interesting. I almost left the theater and I am a huge Transformers fan. On top of that this film makes no sense in the world of the previous Transformer movies. Optimus Prime and the others didn't come to Earth until the first Michael Bay movie and in that movie they had no form yet. There are so many plot holes which makes the story even less interesting. This is almost a direct copy of Sam's story. Losers life that sucks then he/she gets a cool car and their life changes forever. Blah blah snore.I don't understand why everyone is saying this is the best Transformer movie ever. The first one was the best by far. People are looking for a Transformers movie that properly pays homage to the 80's Transformers we love, this movie is definitely not it. Don't waste your time or money.",Bumblebee

Bumblebee will always be the ""kid-like"" transformer... innocent, but powerful enough for no to mess with him, his friends or his loved ones.

571,camuc,Very good fun! Second best Transformers movie so far,8,19 June 2019,"When the first Transformers movie came out in 2007 I loved it because it was a good mix of decent comedy, action and Sci-fi. Things went bad after that, and all other Transformers movie were too focused on messy CGI action, with a few bad jokes or non-believable characters as comic relief.
Bumblebee acts as a prequel in that universe, but thanks to the fact that it focuses on few characters on a smaller scale mission, it manages to find again the balance between action and nice clean situation comedy.
I was happy to see that, even if this movie is somehow connected with the other ones, it enjoys some creative freedom and has many nods to the old cartoons.Special effects seem to be simpler here, because the digital models are way less detailed, but I appreciated how much the Transformers looked like the toys. Also, the photography in this movie is way better than in any of the other Transformer movies.A good movie for the whole family, if you don't mind that your kids see some digitally created robots being beheaded.",Bumblebee
572,brianknowles-59664,Oh my word,3,3 January 2019,"This movie is just awful. It's pandering to the 80s crowd just like everyone else after Stranger Things. The acting is god awful- except for the main girl, she was fine- I mean other than her jeez it sucked. John Cena is a terrible actor, and so is the mom and step dad. It tries to be a new ""classic"" 80s movie like ET or The Goonies but it came out in 2018 so it fails horribly. Back then you had the silly kid characters who's nicknames were ""techno"" and ""goggles"" and dumb stuff like that. In Bumblebee, they try this. Oh no. There is a 20 year old ""nerd"" named ""memo"". That should be enough to make you not wanna see the movie. The 80s references are nonstop and tedious. It's like there's so much nostalgia there isnt even a new movie, it's just nostalgia wrapped in bumblebee. It also has flat cinematography. Don't watch it please.",Bumblebee
573,kiwijinxter,Transformers with story... and THRILLING Generation 1 references!,8,1 January 2019,"Michael Bay's descend to story-lessness in his Transformers movies as they progressed meant this non-Michael Bay movie, Bumblebee, shone all the more. Hailee Steinfeld projects carefree and angst-ridden 18 year old pretty well, and she is a pretty good actress in this show - showing a good range of emotions throughout the movie. In fact this was required, given that Bumblebee's ""emotions"" looked so human that if you put Shia LeBouf in this, Shia would look like a robot.My most absolute favourite and most thrilling thing I got from this movie is the G1 (Generation 1 for non Transformers geeks) references to the original cartoons. I don't want to throw in a spoiler here but if you're a G1 fan, pay close attention to the beginning (Cybertron scene) and towards the end (notice what's next to Bumblebee as he drives across the bridge) of this movie and trust me, you'd be absolutely thrilled! This close link to the G1 Transformers really nailed it for me, and was never part of any of the 5 Michael Bay Transformers movies.There's a lot more ""heart"" to Bumblebee that makes the story more sticky and memorable than much of Michael Bay's Transformers, especially 4 and 5. This also means that there are moments of slower paces when Bumblebee gets to know Hailee's character. I do think that it gets just a little long drawn at some parts, but it doesn't detract from the story much.That said, this movie has some great action too! Right from the beginning, it explodes with action. And the action sequences are actually really good and ""feels"" real. And fans of Michael Bay's fantastic action sequences won't be disappointed because the action sequences in Bumblebee is just as visceral in many parts. So it's a movie well done in terms of balance between action and story - something Michael Bay really needs to get right with his next Transformers movie. The CGI is truly amazing and a spectacle to behold.The one thing I'm not so happy about in Bumblebee are the male actors - or at least their scripts. Gee talk about weak, clueless and useless males. There are plenty of them. Jorge Lendeborg Jr. was a token male and really adds nothing of value or weight to the story. Hailee's onscreen stepfather is a jerk for a start. The army leads are also portrayed as pretty dumb. Even the strong John Cena, has weak lines (except the ending sequence). Just because there's a strong female lead (and Hailee is a very strong and convincing actress), it doesn't mean that we have to have all the males as weak and clueless!It's ironic that upon replacing the increasingly annoying Shia LeBouf with the much more respectable Mark Wahlberg, Michael Bay decides to completely forget stories in Transformers 4 and 5. (as a note, my favourite Michael Bay movies were Transformers 1 and 2). Of all the actors in the recent 6 Transformers movies, I actually like Mark Wahlberg best. Mark Wahlberg is a ""real man"" in the Transformers movies, but unfortunately stifled by weak story.All in all, it's actually a good movie. It's a good break from Michael Bay's story-lessness. Bumblebee has heart and action, and well worth the watch. Good yarn for the eyes. Watch it.",Bumblebee
574,ukcraig,"Watch it, you might like it.",8,11 May 2019,"Ok, so as a transformers geek I'd love a whole movie like the first 10mins, but hey, I know I'm never going to have it. But this is the next best thing. It's warm, easy to watch and full of nods to the 80s and the original transformers, my 2 favourite things. Watch it with an open mind, you never know...",Bumblebee
575,jakob-berge,"It is a statement to «Bayformers», but it also borrows stuff from it.",8,19 October 2020,"You could say that it doesn't have to be a terribly difficult job to please the audience with the newest Transformers spinoff (Bumblebee) compared to the bloated movies before. You could just remove all the things people hate about the previous ones, and then add all the stuff people have always wanted. That is exactly what Bumblebee does though. And it works. I am a defender of 3 of the 5 Bay movies, but it is hard to argue why the last one was the nail in the coffin for most people. The Last Knight was not a change in tone or style, it was exactly what people would expect from a Michael Bay Transformers movie. And to have the next movie, a small-scale character driven story without a bloated runtime, it is easy to see why people would like this.The movie is a fresh take on the Transformers characters. They have the G-1 design which resonates with the fans. Although they first set it up as a spin-off they rightfully changed as a reboot. Which I am glad for, since it is so much things in this movie that questions all the things Bay set up, so it was best just scratching the past. The movie still know where it comes from, there are still explosions, and fast-paced robot fighting. But it is not excessive. And the action looks slick and creative. Especially the first battle on Cybertron is a plea to the fans. The visuals looks great. The transformers actually look like vehicles that can transform to war machines.The previous one, The Last Knight had actually a pretty heavy and bloated plot. This one is more grounded and focuses almost entirely on Charlie (Hailee Steinfeld). She seems very much like a main hero from one of Spielbergs 80 movies. And this movie is clearly heavily inspired by E.T and Iron Giant. John Cena plays the military «bad guy» this time and it is fun he doesn't take it too seriously and can come with some bad one-liners. There are no Megatron or Starscream this time, but new decepticons in Shatter and Dropkick. They are perhaps generic but I liked seeing some new antagonists with clear personalities. One thing that also backs up with the new grounded take is the score. It is way more nice and calm, where Jablonsky's score in the Bayformers was apocalyptic and earth shattering.Weakest points of the movie is that it gets too cheesy and kid friendly at times. I get that they want to answer to Bay's relentless violence and immature humour, but they could still eased down a bit. The soundtrack recollects the 80s to the point of you're getting tired. And Bumblebee has a lot of cute moments when he stumbles in the house and acts like a child, but that too gets too excessive. I didn't find the mother and step-dad relationship with Charlie too necessary really either. Since this is the first of hopefully more in this new entry, we could hope that the next ones offer a bit more tough action and MORE Optimus Prime!",Bumblebee
576,soapmactavishgaming,Best movie in the transformers franchise,10,13 December 2018,"It got everything the movie need the actions, the performances, hell even the 1980 setting

577,movieexpert2001,"too childish, too mediocre, too short and too immature. i'm sticking with the first three bay films",4,1 April 2020,"I hear that critics are giving this film positive reviews but don't just do that just because Michael bay didn't make it and what i don't like about this childish snoozefest is that the acting is bad, and the dialogue is cheesy, this prequel shouldn't have been made and like i said there are many who hate transformers movies and many who also love them but this was based on the cartoon and some thought that when the live action franchise was made it ruined their childhood but no, why would they say that, Michael bay didn't ruin their childhood he just made it more mature because the cartoon was basically a show for 6-7 year old little kids and the robots didn't have creative designs then and the reason why i consider the Michael bay version of transformers better is because he made the designs look cooler by putting flames on Optimus prime and making bumblebee look both tough and friendly like he is supposed to be and in his movies even though bumblebee was a great and kind autobot who had a heart and soul he was still brave and could fight deceptions easily he was still also being serious and here in this dumb and laughably mediocre prequel bumblebee here just acts like a lazy sad old robot freak who is hiding and doesn't know how to act and then this girl played by hailee steinfeld is saddened by the death of her father and regret for her mother which you don't even feel sad for her and here there is also john cena who may be a cool wrestling guy in real life but here things are done pointless and if not completely pointless still unmoving, and what this is really showing is that this is going back to the cartoons where the robots looked like toys and didn't have decorating designs in them and it does take place in the same universe as the bay franchise and that it basically shows that Optimus prime and the autobots where still on the planet cybertron and still existing and bumblebee was the first autobot who came to cybertron first and later when the bayformers started the rest came and they got more armored and started to have designs so technically this shows when they were all young and when the bay franchise began they got older and started having more designs and there were some critics who liked bay films and admired him alot and praise bay for how he shot action and in this ludicrous rip off there isn't much of that action, people used to love bayformers in the past and then started to hate them when age of extinction came out and also when revenge of the fallen was out to but all of that was the Michael bay treasure and now it has all been wiped away and there was a reason he stepped down as director he couldn't deal with the franchise anymore like he used to and the last two which were age of extinction and last knight were probably the most hated films in the franchise but it wasn't really bay's fault he just did it because he had too and the studio wanted more in the franchise and they must have told bay to make it different with different character's and the Autobots preparing to no longer defend humans and that is why i consider age of extinction to be the second worst in the franchise and it was only succesful in earning lots of money in china as well as praise from the Chinese audience and in china that is where the hype on the film was going on everywhere else the fans do not consider it their favorite and the last knight was much worse because their was too much plot bad character development and trashy scenes with bad editing and no longer feeling the thundering wrath from the action bay shoots that is where he ran out of ideas in making a transformers movie but there was a reason it had to be made and exist because of age of extinction and therefore it was his last, and as far as i am concerned this bumblebee movie is better than age of extinction and last knight if there was any chance this prequal was better than any of the bays transformers movies. and what it proves is that the franchise can be good again and that we can still feel that the first three transformers movies were good and this goes back to when the autobots where defending humans and this is the best i can say about it overall its not so good. and even if you may all hate transformers it is all going to stay the same whether bay is directing them or not they cannot completely be redeemed it is not a great franchise and if that is why . critics are going to hate on the franchise nothing will change them from hating them Michael bay doesn't ruin anything he is many things he is by far one of the reasons cinema is great he may well be the Jesus christ of cinema and the film industry will never exist without him some great directors can make bad movies to and bay is one of those very great directors. and if critics can love this movie then this is one of the only movies where a not so famous director makes a movie better than a famous director does. some say they dont like a movie just because michael bay made it no that is not true there are good things in michael bay movies many people love him and that he is one of hollywoods leading directors and there could be a very well done good movie made by him like saying if godfather and citizen kane were directed by Michael bay they would still like it because they are well made movies and are one of the best in the world, the rumors and links are all wrong of course critics would like a really well made movie even if michael bay was involved in it , they only don't like some of bay's movies because they have big flaws. and again this movie here is mediocre and it is immature, when someone is a die hard fan of transformers they would be liking it when their little watching the old cartoon and then when they become teenagers they like the bay made franchise that would be how a real transformers fan would be not just first like the cartoon when their little and then when the bay movie comes out they think it ruined their childhood , no it doesn't ruin their childhood it makes it way better and more mature. and plus the bay transformers made much more movie than this silly Prequal. and sometimes you criticize a bay film just because it is to long but how can they do that , that is a poor excuse to complain about a bay movie. he is a very big and famous director like i said famous directors make long movies and not to mention other directors we love make long movies to Scorsese movies are long. the lord of the rings movies are long and some of Spielberg's movies are long and plus bay was the producer of this movie so you can even thank bay here because even though he didn't direct it he produced it so its a half classic that is produced in the hands of bay and Spielberg like some viewers said that this is another great film produced by Spielberg but also say it is also by bay because he produced it , but in my opinion it is not a great film , it is better than age of extinction and last knight and maybe in a very few parts better than revenge of the fallen still this is not as good as the Michael bay treasures, there are reasons he does the movies better and that he was and used to be the perfect choice for making a live action sci fi robots franchise based on toys because he was probably a fan of the 1986 cartoon, in truth this movie is not a audience attracter and more people would like to se more action and a movie with more action would be a bay movie so i am definitely sticking to the first three transformers movies that bay made that i really loved , 2007, revenge of the fallen and dark of the moon. final grade score C-",Bumblebee

Only that dog is Bumblebee.The first hour of this film is excellent. The set up to the movie and the premise are very simple, straightforward, and fun. Unfortunately, it's all downhill from there.Hailee Steinfeld is an amazing actress with enormous potential, who carries this movie throughout. However, despite all the heart and innocence this movie exudes, it slowly devolves into a generic, forced mess of a story.Most notably, there is a confusing non-love interest/love interest introduced an hour into the film that goes absolutely nowhere, which feels more like a studio mandated element, rather than an organic occurrence. Certain characters and the movie itself poke fun at its illogical nature and tropes that these types of movies fall victim to, only to end up in those same categories itself by the end.There are seeds of greatness in this movie and Hailee makes it worth watching.

Borrowing heavily from The Iron Giant, the storyline is simple and familiar territory. The first act is captivating, insomuch that finally, they hired an actor who can act, mixed with the MTV soundtrack, make for a welcome entertainment respite. Then we slip into some 2nd act silliness, but a nice finale to end on a high note.
The producers of this film played it a lot smarter. BumbleBee the movie does not take itself so seriously. There is goofiness everywhere. They know, we know, everyone knows that this all started with a toy! The opening music is ""Big Mouth Strikes Again"" for crying out loud...I can honestly say that I did not see that one coming.

Charlie helps him, and they develop a beautiful friendship.
The transformers movies has always been very disliked by the critics since the beggining.Movies filled with massive explosions, huge action sequences, and lacking the most important, good storytelling, directing and character development.
Bumblebee is exactly what these movies were lacking.
Bumblebee dosen´t have the most original story, however it manages to work really well.It´s simple but good.
The cast is good, especially Hailee Steinfeld who plays the main Character Charlie.The center of the movie is the relation between her and Bee, the relation is very well developed mainly because of the great interpatation of Steinfeld, it feels real and honest, as an audience you aboslutely buy.
The visual effects are great, the action sequences well directed, and edited.
Another element well achieved is the humor, the movie is very funny.
There´s a sense of discovery, innocence throught that was very necessary , and that is present in here.
The only weaknesses i found , were that some minnor characters were a little cliché, and in the end there´s a big action sequence, in terms of script it could have been better resolved.
Bumblebee is very enjoyable.It´s a sweet, funny, action packed blockbuster, it´s definitively different and superior to the last installments.
Maybe this could be the start of something new, let´s hope.7.6/10",Bumblebee

I made an oath that wouldn't watch anymore Transformers movies as they have all failed and were complete disasters. The reason I say this is because I'm 41. I loved the Transformers cartoons back in the 80's and I wished they would make a movie based on the original show with the robots looking like the cartoon but Michael Bay flushed that all down the toilet.
So.... I found that this one had a 7.1 rating on IMDB and very positive reviews claiming that this was the best Transformers movie of ALL time. So I decided to give it a go. The first 10 minutes of the movie were pure magic and joy. The war on Cibertron, Optimus looking like Optimus, Soundwave with his tapes, Shockwave with his voice.... I mean it had every potential to be an epic movie.
Then ... well .... I was trying not to fall asleep for the remaining 85 minutes. The movie was soooo boring, acting was horrible especially by Jon Cena (and don't get me started on THAT solute at the end where I felt I wanted to actually slap myself).

602,jetmoviereviews,The Best Transformers Film by far.,9,24 December 2018,"Bumblebee is a movie that I was really looking forward to. Although the Transformers franchise is one of my guilty pleasures, I can still acknowledge the fact that they are not good films. I wanted to see a movie that wasn't racist, sexist, or full of immature humor. I wanted a movie that took itself seriously, with good, non-annoying characters that I could love and feel for. Yet, for some reason, I walked into this movie expecting all of that. Does Bumblebee rise above these expectations? Yes. Bumblebee has none of it. Bumblebee is the best live-action Transformers film yet.
This movie is not directed by Michael Bay, and you can really tell. It's brighter and has a lot more heart. It isn't racist, sexist, or immature. It has everything a fan of the classic animated series would want, with costumes and sounds ripped straight from that show. It understood the source material, unlike the Bay films. It knew how to please the fans and give them what they want, unlike the Bay films. It wasn't overblown or over two-and-a-half hours long, unlike the Bay films. This film is so different from the Bay films, it doesn't even feel like it should belong in the same universe as them.
Hailee Steinfeld was great in this film, and brought a lot of heart to it. She played a good character for Bumblebee to bounce off of, and both of them could really relate to each other. Bumblebee was great in this movie, too, obviously. Unlike the other Transformers films, it solely focuses on Bee, with Optimus only showing up a few times. There were not many transformers in this film at all. It feels so condensed from what the other films were, which is something the franchise really needed.
The opening battle on Cybertron was awesome to watch. The fight scenes in general were all very exciting. They weren't full of explosion after explosion after explosion. The villains of the movie were bland Decepticons; nothing great about them, but nothing terrible. John Cena's character was fine. The movie didn't need a human villain, but he turned out a good guy in the end, so oh well. Charlie's (Hailee Steinfeld) family were okay. They weren't annoying like Sam's family were in the first 3 Transformers films, so that's a plus.
Overall, this movie is pretty awesome. It may seem cheesy and campy at times, but that's okay, because the classic animated series was, too. It brings heart and color to the Transformers franchise. There were some continuity issues that could come into play if they continue to stay a part of the first 5 films, but I feel they could call this a reboot and completely erase those other films from existence (but I don't think they will). This is, by far, the best Transformers film yet. I highly recommend this, even if you are a huge hater of the franchise. It brings a lot of great changes to the franchise; changes that were very much needed.",Bumblebee

605,jexe-51145,Best part about this movie is the music.,6,1 March 2019,Loved the nostalgia factor on this movie. I'm a late 80's early 90's kid so I loved the trip back in time. The music in the film was especially fun. The film over all was cute.,Bumblebee
606,amardamani-03957,75% - Finally a good Transformers movie!,7,10 February 2019,"This movie is a big step up from the Michael Bay series, which really doesn't mean much when you think about it. This movie is dominated by Charlie and Bumblebee, who are captivating in their own way. Charlie is getting over her father's untimely death, while her family has seemingly gotten over him in a flash. Bumblebee is in charge of scouting out and protecting Earth, and together these two form a bond. I think Memo comes in at a perfect time for this movie. Cena is forced to team up with the Decepticons, but he isn't the villain. He doesn't realize that the Decepticons are the real villains until the end. The Autobots vs Decepticons battle is the same, and overall the movie benefits from the Decepticons.75% - Thank you for an actually good Transformers movie, would watch again! I'm waiting for the Sequel!",Bumblebee

608,calebmschultz,Very Average,4,6 April 2019,It's a very average movie. There's nothing really special about this film. It's only slightly better than Michael Bay's Transformers movies. The only thing I enjoyed about this film was the soundtrack.,Bumblebee

610,venomlifeguard,Awful waste of time.,1,25 June 2020,"I'm a massive transformers fan but this is a terrible movie. The writer, Christina hodson is an out and out feminist and self inserted herself in this movie from her own words.The human characters are boring. The male decepticon is a subordinate character following orders from a female decepticon. When they first transform he decides to kill a guy for no reason.The action is good but there's some cringey stuff like the beta male friend and the weird romantic vibe they tried to give the girl with bumblebee. Also a girl nor any human should be naming a centuries old transformer, that was an awful decision.You'll see old fans swindled by the Cybertron scenes and the soundtrack but this is legitimately the worst entry into the live action series.",Bumblebee
611,Sicaa369,A step in the right direction for the franchise and overall a great movie,10,29 September 2020,"Honestly I skiped watching this film when it came out because after Revenge of the Fallen i lost interest in any Transformers related media. This not only took me by suprise, when i watched it during lockdown, but also weirdly became not only my favorite TF movie, but also one of my top 5 movies of all time!The movie is more focused on character work than plot (like Alita battle Angel and Shazam for example) yet it worked. Bumblebee and Charlies relationship was so much fun to watch grow and actually made me cry during some scenes of the movie. They are the heart and soul of the movie which made it more rewatcable. It also makes sense since Bee in every other version of TF is suposed to be the human side of Autobots, caring and more friendly, and always had a human side-character next to him, which makes sense to ad Charlie as support to him. This also brings down a negative because most people may not be that interested in a Mean Girls type story with ""finding your place in the world"" theme, with some quiet and more lighthearted moments not excpected from this type of movie.Now for the script, it feels like an actual 80s friendship movie (Karate Kid, The Iron Giant, Free Willy), chessy, funny, emotinal and overall easy to follow. It might be boring to some people, but it worked for me.There was a scene similar to the 2007 movie, which was in the trailer, where he trashes the house which later links to the story going foward, which was cute and funny, but it kind of ruined the more emotinal parts which i adored and loved with the goofynes, and thats the only scene i kind of didn't liked.The casting of the movie was very good in my opinion, with Hailee Steinfeld shining as Charlie, and John Cena actually being not that bad as Agent Burns as i excpected him to be. I also have not found any other character to be anoying, and Dylan O' Bryan was perfect as Bumblebee and i want his voice back for the sequel. Decepticions were great and well realyzed. More positivity, the action sequences were pretty great, the 80s vibe of the movie with his Best of soundtrack and overall story was enjoyable and designs were great and in my opinion better than in Miachel Bays films.The movie may not be enjoyed by people who liked the previous films or don't want another 80s growing of age story, and maybe because of the design changes, focus on character and the movie not having a clear plot like in most action/adventure movies, but that is on you to decide. The movie is more about friendship and overcoming your problems and finding someone who can understands, cares and listens to you and helps you move foward as a person.Overall, this was a breath of freshair for me and a big number of people who were fans of the franchise but not invested in the mostly bad Bay films, (I loved the first one) with great action, characters, soundtrack , G1 cybertron with full on fan base material and visuals that made it a pleasure to watch, witch gives it a special place in my heart.Definitely recommend you see it and form your opinion. 8/10 for me",Bumblebee
612,ultimatew,The movie has Heart,5,17 February 2019,"I like parts of this movie, but the John Cena character just doesn't work either he cannot act or it was poorly written or both, but he is not funny and comes in as way over the top with no character to him, its like a bad filling that just doesn't need to be there, cut him out and its a 8 or 9, where the first movies that part was funny and made sense, this is just hard to watch.Hailee Steinfeld and Jorge Lendeborg Jr. are great and the reason you should watch this.Cena and the mean girls really does not do what they should, cut them out and you have a shorter and better film. some of those parts seem like an after thought and ohh it worked in the first, we can use that.This could have been so much better, at best its a 5.",Bumblebee

614,skywalkeriit,Another Hollywood title destroyed by Chinese money,4,24 March 2019,"There are two types of Hollywood movies now, one that are made for global audience and another that is made for Chinese audience. Since china allows only few Hollywood movies that satisfy particular conditions (like Chinese investment or Chinese actors etc) to get screen time in china, which gives access to huge sums of ticket money, many Hollywood titles that have been overproduced and have outrun their charm (like Transformer) sell their production right to Chinese production houses who then produce the most cliche and stereotypical movies for Chinese audiences that will have slow motion action, overused drama and dialogues and dead childish plots. These movies are made to make depressed Chinese population laugh, nothing else.",Bumblebee
615,amandawillett0,"Gotta love the ""Love Bug""",10,23 December 2018,"This movie was highly to do on my watch list to see as soon as it came out. I cannot tell you how pleased I am with how the film told it's story. Seeing the other Transformers movies I always wondered if there was going to be a film that would tell exactly how Bumblebee came to earth and why. Not only did it do that but it gave a more depth story and you could not wish for anything more to love that VW Beetle more. His heart, humor, charm and determination sailed through the story. And everything else that went along with it did a beautiful job telling the story of how it all started. I highly recommend this film to anyone who may not only love the Transformers franchise but anyone who just needs a feel good movie and some action. One thing I will say though...can't help but love that Bee. <3",Bumblebee

621,midgetman-76483,Nostalgic 1980's adolescent teen flick tribute,9,28 October 2020,"Many of the viewer critics panned this movie. I emphasize CRITICS!!! Maybe I have a Pollyanna attitude when I watch some movies, especially heartwarming films, but sometimes all I want is to be ENTERTAINED!!! This movie fulfills that need for me!!! It is a properly rated PG-13, heartwarming, family movie with teen-angst characters, quite similar to those of the 1980's, a touch of comedy, and modern action!!!
It has music the ""Transformers' generation"" would have listened to in the family car, as well as the movie clips, props and scenes they would have watched on the family VCR with their parents. From the ""Breakfast Club"" scene and movie posters of the era, to the nuances of Charlie's BFG overalls, it pays tribute to both Steven Spielberg and John Hughes, BOTH were GIANTS of the 80's!!! One thing that I noticed right away, was the family car. It is very reminiscent of the Griswold family's ugly green, faux wood-paneled station wagon from ""National Lampoon's Vacation"", written by Hughes!!! In the final chase scene, the dad recreates Clark's reckless swerving of the huge ""boat""! With a touch of irony, unlike the Griswold car's fate, their car survives catastrophic close-calls WITHOUT a scratch!!!",Bumblebee
622,alanlovoe,Best Transformers so far,8,24 March 2019,"I think that the original Transformers with Camaro Bumblebee was quite great, however after that the transformers got weird and weird and harder to distinguish from a crashed soda can flying through the air.
This new bumblebee movie is awesome, a lot of the spirit of the first transformers with tons of Transformers G1 which is greatly appreciated.
I like it a lot even at some points more than the original one, here the female character is not over sexualized and the story plot even when corny and predictable is more in alignment with transformer from the animated series which i really like ( i grew up with multiple generations of transformers, i'm 35 and i've seen all versions that came up so if that counts for something)",Bumblebee

626,LoneWolfArcher,Best Transformers movie so far!,10,12 April 2020,"Just watched Bumblebee. I thought the trailers made it look good but for some reason or another I couldn't get around to seeing it until today. Wow!First, I'm a huge fan of Hailee Steinfeld. I thought she was awesome in the Coens' remake of True Grit. And she did not disappoint in this movie. I'd love to see her as the heroine of more action films.Also, while I loved the original Transformers, I thought the sequels have all been giant turds. So when I saw the preview for this movie I was excited to see it as it appeared to be more than just dozens of Transformers fighting.Having been a casual fan of Transformers comics in the 80s, I was happy with this movie being set in the 80s. Steinfeld's Charlie also has a good backstory that makes this movie work.I saw another review call this movie cliched. And yes it is a typical American ""I'll rescue you and you rescue me"" movie. But with the Transformers background it works. And Charlie is brought to life so well by Steinfeld that you can't help but root for her. And of course for Bumblebee.Bumblebee has always been my favorite Transformer, so I may be a bit biased. But this was a fun movie that draws you in and keeps you entertained.Loved this movie and look forward to future viewings!",Bumblebee
627,jarenlyman,More of what I wanted from the beginning,8,24 December 2018,"Ever since I was a kid I've always thought that the concept of Transformers was really cool, but I've never cared for a single one of the live action movies. Even when people try to defend the first one, I just couldn't bring myself to like it. So when I first saw the trailer for this movie, I had zero interest, but knew I would probably get dragged to it by my buddies. Well I'm happy to say that this is easily the best Transformers movie so far. Not only is it the first one I've actually enjoyed, it's the first one to get me excited for the future of this franchise. It should come as no surprise that if you cut out racist stereotypes, junior high humor, annoying and unlikable human characters, and making women overly sexualized, it makes for a much less cringy film. For the most part, this movie does away with all of those major issues I had with all of the rest of them. It doesn't beat you over the head with product placement nearly as much, or it at least isn't as blatantly obvious about it. One of the glaring problems I've had with the last five is that they're all the same movie pretty much. They follow almost the exact same formula. While this one does have some similar plot lines, majority of the movie feels pretty fresh, especially the first half. It sort of breaks the mold a bit and tries a little harder to give the fans more of what they've wanted from the start. It's directed well, it has mostly good performances, and I found myself caring a lot more for this story than any of the previous entries. Really the only complaint that comes to mind is that there is still a small amount of annoying human characters. There is a step father character who got on my nerves a little, and a little brother who did the same. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't a little relieved every time they left the screen. I am happy to say though that they weren't enough to drag the movie down for me, and thankfully they're roles weren't major. If you were anything like me, and liked the concept of Transformers, and even the 80's cartoon, but haven't cared for any of the movies, I would say give this one a shot. It's a much better representation of what the franchise could've and should've been all along!",Bumblebee
628,jaramirez-77245,Can't believe they made this movie,2,31 December 2019,"Watching this movie as I write this. I have had to fast forward to skip from falling asleep. I'm a child of the 80s, grew up watching The transformers cartoons, G.I. Joe etc. Why does everyone think they can ride the ""stranger things"" train to a good movie?! Captain Marvel, Bumblebee, Wonder Woman 84, etc. Being Nostalgic is not the way to a good movie. Outside of the soundtrack, this was a sad movie. Like another reviewer said : am I watching the same movie? If I want E.T. or the goonies, I'll watch that. I do not need a rehash. How in the world would the Transformers back story start with Bumblebee? Thank God it's free on Amazon Prime and I didnt pay for a $15 movie ticket. Also why is everyone bashing Michael Bay? He may not have directed bit is still holding the rains. Check out who the producer is. Anyone gave this movie more than a 5, probably loved Justice League .",Bumblebee

Not only is it an immense improvement for Transformers but it's quite good a film in general. A very smart move using the established and adored Bumblebee to craft the reboot.This movie has a strong structure with conflict, action, sediment, relatability, and resolution without making it feel as forced as many films tend to do. The full circle moment at the end was still like,""Oh, of course that would happen"" but instead of it feeling annoyingly cliché I heartwarmingly accepted it which speaks volumes of the method used by the director/scriptwriters.The acting is solid all the way around, again even the cliché moments for the characters behavior is welcomed with a smile.This film really shows how much the Micheal Bay Transformers movies looked like over-budgeted straight to DVD garbage with the exception of Bay's first attempt(which this film still exceeds).

Soundwave speaks and has the right voice, the nostalgia factor when he does gives goosebumps, well done.Good soundtrack.Too much on the human side of things......It's the wrong way around, the amount of time given to the Cybertron scenes should be applied to human scenes.

And its mainly because of the fact that i love transformers. For eg. even though deep inside my heart i know that The last knight was a huge dissapointment and a waste to the limitless capabilities it had, i would still go out and be able to praise so many good things about it..you know Why ? Because i love Transformers!!! and It goes same with this movie named Bumblebee. Now this was a different take. A lot more focused into story and character building rather than some metal smashing CGI epics by Michael Bay(love them too). Its mainly a great introduction film for the younger audience. Do i like it? Yes i like it because why not appreciate a different take and see the freshness of this film. Previously they've missed a good story and a plot(In some). While in this movie i really missed those IMAX action sequences, amazing scores that we had been treated in the past. I really dont want this franchise to end. Be it Bay, be it knight, be it anyone..Please keep them coming. Plus and minus are everywhere. You cant make everyone happy.P. s
Is this best of the Franchise? I dont know. I think each one of them is unique on its own. They have their own individual wins, loss, flavors and emotions, and shouldnt be compared really.
I still sit like a child, switch on my home theatre and watch the tv whenever any of the transformers movie is on.

648,sandrews3333,Not that great,4,27 January 2019,I liked the first 2 transformers movies. Why in the beginning did optimus prime already look like his truck if he'd never been to earth yet. Kinda confuse over that.,Bumblebee
649,Just_watching,Best re-boot!!!,8,24 March 2019,"This is by far the best transformers movie!!! It kept that original 80's feel. Even the look. I hope they make a part 2. Watch it, you won't regret it!!",Bumblebee

Terrific film!",Bumblebee
651,craigosenior,Better than previous transformers but it's no Iron Giant.,5,20 January 2019,"Good eighties music and kind of heartwarming but I can't help but compare it to the Iron Giant. In fact some scenes seem almost stolen from that movie, and it's not an improvement!",Bumblebee
652,gmk2311,Definitely one of the better entries in the series,9,26 December 2018,"Contrary to some reviews, sorry to burst your bubbles, Michael Bay WAS invved in the production of this film. We can split hairs about his level of involvement.
Regardless of that issue, this movie had a lot of heart. Whereas some of the films seemed to be working to introduce new Transformer Toy lines, this movie seemed more focused on entertaining.
There were some points where some people will feel the pacing was too slow, and some things occurred which just didn't makes sense. But it is a fantasy movie.
How do 10 Hummers sneak up behind you in the middle of a battle?
The effects seemed similar to all previous Transformers films but a bit more subdued with less Mega battles and destruction along the way.
Anyway, it was an enjoyable ride!",Bumblebee

658,Wombat_x1,That's more like it!,7,4 January 2019,"I enjoyed this movie because the characters were much closer to the original tv series, and there was actually time to enjoy the battle scenes. The story was not that bad, but not high standing, and very predictable. You get the feeling you've seen this movie before, but with characters you love. What it does do, is open the franchise to more possibilities for the future. Acting wise, it was well cast.",Bumblebee
659,poisonsword,"Trust me, this is the worst ever",1,6 January 2019,"How is Charlie's mom doesn't even questioned her over the big pile mess in the house? The only question her mom asked her was 'What happened, Charlie?' as if Charlie could mess destroy the house like that alone. At least make the parenting skill real. A mom doesn't simply ask a commom question when the house is destroyed. Secondly,what is the point of the cliff diving scene? To show how weak Charlie is? For what? The weakness isn't even serve the purpose in the movie. Unless if her father died from jumping from the platform, that would make sense. And they took a revenge and throw tissues and eggs to Tina house? I thought thet should've throw those things to the Asian girl's house as her love interest insult the Asian girl with the tissue joke earlier. And Bumbblebee destroying Tina's car and nobody in the neighbourhood woke up to check the noise out and not even Tina's family. What a weird 80's neighbourhood. The female Deception spotted Charlie trying to destroy the signal, she then tries to shoot Charlie and guess what, non of her bullets hit Charlie. But every of her bullets would hit Bumblebee without any missed. How weak the villians, huh? And Charlie is so confident saying nobody is in the beach so she could teach Bumblebee. As if she knows nobody is behind those trees on in the wood near the beach. It is a beach we are talking about here. When the electricity pools explode, nobody cares to check it out. If something explodes, I would go out and shout my lungs out. A scene where Charlie jumps into the water to save Bumblebee was so out of mind. She didn't even think twice of the danger if she jumps. What if she jumps in the water and hit them metals and steels that caused by the fighting impact? What is the purpose or a scene where Charlie asked the nerd to take off his shirt to be a Katy Perry? It took her an entire life to fix the car in the garaj but only take half day to fix the beattle and drive home safe. The funniest thing is the two villians working on the signal technology in the human lab like human. They were typing nonsense like a dumb machine. They are a freaking robot. They should've used their mind or power as a machine, not working on technology with their hand. I have to laugh. There a lot more nonsense but my fingers are numb now I need to stop writing. For God sake, this movie is the worst ever. The movie targeted audience is probably infants or babies.",Bumblebee
660,littlebrownclown,The Buzz Lived Up to the Hype!,10,8 January 2019,"I almost saw Escape Room tonight, instead of Bumblebee (due to my disillusionment with the Transformers movie franchise), and I'm so glad I read a critic's review and changed my mind at the last minute.If you grew up in the 80s and you love the feel of the era, this movie takes you all the way back. As some have said, it could have actually been made in the 80s and it would have been a gigantic blockbuster. I stared in wonder at things I'd completely forgotten about...Mr. T cereal, etc. There were so many hilarious scenes where I laughed so hard I cried. Nothing was overdone and everything FIT. Hailee Steinfeld (Charlie) was THE perfect, damaged girl trying to recover from her father's death, while the rest of the family seems to have moved on with the new stepdad (who annoys the crap out of her with his positivity). She doesn't seem to fit in with her own family, her classmates, or even at her job. No one seems to SEE her, until she takes home a (free) yellow Herbie from the junkyard and gets him up and running again. The Herbie turns out to be Bumblebee, who has forgotten who he is, and finding out is a super fun, funny, warm and exciting trip. The movie made me want to LIVE IN IT. There was a moment when she and her new friend/neighbor were riding along the coast in Bumblebee and she opened the top, they both stood up in the seats and put their hands up in the air. The camera pans back and it 100% captured the wild, carefree feeling of the 80s. I teared up in happiness as I remembered what it felt like to be a teenager with no worries, no real responsibilities, no true awareness of what the world held, and only the open road before me.One of my favorite scenes is when Charlie's mom takes Bumblebee-Herbie to the vet with the dog in the back while Charlie is sleeping. When she wakes up and finds out from her brother where Bumblebee went and she knows he's going to blow his cover somehow, she races along and catches up to them on her moped. As she's approaching the car, Bumblebee takes his hand out of the trunk and starts waving at her...just this big, metal hand waving at her from the trunk, while she's freaking out thinking her mom's going to see it in the rearview mirror. Bumblebee then starts trying to wave at the dog, who's up in the back window. I want a POSTER of that one scene...it was that funny and sweet.Another favorite scene was when she tries to teach Bumblebee how to hide when they're alone on the beach. It is so, so, so hilarious when she ""hides"" behind a rock and tells him to hide, only to discover he's curled up in a ball facing her on the beach with his big face looking right at her.Nostalgia aside, the action sequences were totally believable and gripping. At one point, when it seemed like all hope was lost and the military was dragging Bumblebee away, after John Cena's character threw Charlie aside and hurt her, and a defeated Bumblebee looks up and sees her (after being immobilized by the Decepticons moments earlier, who left him for dead), seeing his fists grip and pulverize the concrete and watching him stand and tear off the hooks was awesome. There were so many moments when you wish you were IN the movie that it's crazy.In the end, Charlie and Bumblebee help each other find themselves and the strength to get up and fight again. They give each other a voice in a world that tries to silence them. Depression turns into delight, and the entire movie franchise gets new life. As some have said, forget all of the other movies and start making new ones where this one left off. Travis Knight is a movie rockstar!(Oh, and the fact that there wasn't any cursing that I can remember and no sexual innuendos or scenes was something I thought Hollywood forgot how to successfully deliver.)",Bumblebee

Don't watch!",Bumblebee
666,maxtiggertom,"Abuzz with heart, charm, wit and action.",9,24 June 2019,"Let me just start off by saying the last film in this franchise was like getting your hand chewed up in a blender. Not pleasant, fun or joyful. Leaving you in a truck load of pain afterwards. This film on the other hand is like a duet in the 50's. Sweet, Fun and above all charming. Directed by Laika's own CEO: Travis Knight.This film is ballparks away from any of Michael Bay's destructive tendencies. While yes, the film does start out with action it is well-shot, coherent and easy to follow. The film starts out on the ""Cybertron"" (the Transformers home planet). Without spoling anything the destruction leads to Bumblebee crash landing on Earth in the year 1987. From there the action kicks off again and yet again it is a great action set-piece and sets up Bumblebee's character for the rest of the film.Bumblebee then runs into ""Charlie Watson"" played by ""Hailee Steinfeld"". Once she comes onto the screen she is instantly relatable, from her gruff somber demeanor to her music tastes. ""The Smiths"" being front and center of that. Her performance is nuanced and calm but also has a bite to it when it needs to. In addition to this she is not afraid of dabbling in the film's sense of humor. Her performance is easily the highlight of the film not saying the other elements of the film are not up to that standard, because they most certainly are.From there the film dives into 80's music like an Olympic gold medalist, giving us a sweet and loving reminder of the decade that this film recedes in. Not only in music are we reminded of the era but also the posters littering Charlie's room and a bizarre reference to a TV show of the time. Speaking of the music my favorite scene of the film involves a ""Sam Cooke"" record while also adding a genuinely sad piece of exposition that is handled with great care and nuance.That is not to give credit when it is most certainly due John Cena has a good if somewhat intentionally hammy performance as well delivering a few very funny lines throughout the film, the family of Charlie also deserve a mention as they immediately bloomed with great performances by ""Pamela Adlon"" and ""Stephen Schneider"".The film also has great moments of character development. Most notably with Charlie and Bumblebee's relationship. In fact, there are only a few big action scenes in this film. Personally, I find this refreshing as character development is put in front and center and the film is all the better for it.
In conclusion I loved this film with its enduring main protagonists. Of Bumblebee and Charlie this film is worth going to see for their friendship alone.5/5 thumbsHighly recommended",Bumblebee
667,cjdaniels-40040,Really boring,4,12 January 2019,This film gets so hype then watching it make even the first transformers funny. It just the first transformers but boring and nothing to do with the transformers trilogy. Why John Cena he not experienced and he is a rock wannabe.

Autobots had tires sticking out on their bodies, they wouldn't have those till they get to Earth and mimic Earth vehicles. Same thing Optimus has his chest that looks like windows from the Semi.

Forgive me if despite that, I found the first few Transformers movies a but of a modern spectacle of CG without much substance. This was the total opposite. It was a character driven story about two people who need eachother to fill a void in their life, and also an opportunity to fight in the war. I am afraid I expected the worst from this movie. Since Bumblebee was one of the more child friendly autobots in the early 2010s movies, I was expecting the next Jar Jar Binks. Bumblebee comes across, instead, as a lost and broken soldier. If you are into Human-Like AI, Future Tech, Girl Power, Teen Adventure, John Cena, or 80s Nostalgia, Definitely Give This Film a Go.",Bumblebee
676,mmunro68,How Transformers should have been done (Michael Bay - Take Note),8,15 January 2019,"At first I was sceptical about this film. A director I hadn't really heard about, Michael Bay producer. The recipe screamed: slow motion transformations, poor characters and plot, and tons of explosions. How wrong could I be?!The film starts on Cybertron, all out war and epic quick fights between Autobots and Decepticons. Brilliant start. It then follows B-127 (our beloved Bumblebee) to Earth, to how he attempts to adjust to life on Earth after what he has seen in the war. Great background story to the brave little scout. Now onto Charlie. Hailee Steinfeld, take a bow. A lot of potential in this young actress who drew you in and was actually a great character who didn't get in the way all the time. Amazing voice acting and I loved the retro feel. Felt very 80's and also paid homage to the original Transformers from in 1984.Overall, if you enjoyed the original Transformers and also didn't really like the Bay films then you will enjoy this. I certainly plan to watch it again!7.5/10",Bumblebee
677,danne-afterdark,Works if you're 7 years old,4,10 January 2019,"People and critics must've rated this movie from a childs point of view, cause it felt like watching something straight out of disney channel.Both me and my friend are huge transformers fans and I, for one, had tons of transformers toys growing up in the 80's. After seeing Michael Bay's versions I wasn't too impressed. I had a big problem with how Optimus, Bumblebee, Megatron and Starscream looked and how they transformed from objects to robots (too many small parts transforming... ).When I saw the new trailer of Bumblebee I got excited. They made the transformers look like how I remembered them from my childhood. The story seemed to be better and I had no issues with the cast.As a guy in his mid 30's who's longing for a good, well written transformers movie I felt disappointed.The movie was about teenage girl who had her personal teenage problems and then she found a robot who she treated as her puppy. A few action scenes here and there but nothing spectacular.If you're a hardcore 80's transformers fan like me I'd suggest you watch it on bluray when it comes out.",Bumblebee

We,as in the audience, have become brainless to the bile regurgitation known as Hollywood movie scripts. Movie companies apparently don't want to write a descent movie, just cash in on garbage. This movie was....horrible. Completely a green screen cartoon. Yes. I know it's Transformers and my son loved it. Hence the 3 rating. However, he told me while the movie was 30 minutes in...""Dad, it's the iron giant!"" Save your money and watch The Iron Giant on Netflix.

Many have said it better than me, but I'm going to do the forbidden thing and explain why this is really bad.It doesn't pick good actors, it doesn't have good writing. It has social justice writing and social justice actors. The star of the show is a girl, go figure, who has had a hard and touch life tougher than most human beings, awww how sad :(:(:( and is better than all the men at the local mechanic shop at being a mechanic, yet somehow dirt poor. Then, as soon as I saw the individual of color who tried to talk to her I made a joke about him becoming her boyfriend or best friend, whichever, who travels around with her. Turns out to be true.The writers, wrote this so that they could empower women and show diversity, not to tell a story. There's no story to this. Its complete crap. I stopped watching half way though it was just so boring and predictable. I have nothing against women, or people of color. Its just this garbage tries to push a political agenda on you, instead of telling a story.Hell, now there are female transformers, when their race was genderless before. How the hell does that even work? And the female ones are smarter than the male ones. What?!?!Good lord. Get some better writers.

Teletran 1 must have broken down or something. Anyways, this turned out to be more of the same bay-formers, with less action and only 3 robots. Well, the original 1986 movie is still the best. Maybe they will make a prequel to this one and actually do it right. I should give this movie 3 stars, but they know what the fans want, and they continue to push out this junk, so your only getting one star. They think they are doing us a favor by playing 15 seconds of ""You got the touch"", but what they don't understand is that song only works if optimus prime is doing a twist flip in the air while blasting Decpticons.Fun fact:Did you know if you tie a transformer up with a chain and pull on it the right way, it will cause him/her to explode into pieces?",Bumblebee

I guess it's a different meaning of the word.Transformers was originally a boys cartoon, full of violence and tribal allegiance. And this movie has all of that. But it's confusing gender roles by having the girl as the mechanic and the boy with the embarrassing range of hair products. While slamming the ""normal kids"", the friends who are masculine males and the feminine females. ie: 95% of the population.Then they try to sell us on the idea that an 18 year metal loving, mechanic chick is a perfect christian when it comes to dating.And the final song as the credits role was fluffy bunny stuff.Come on Hollywood.

692,stefanelectric,Why 10 years to finally get it Right ?,9,23 December 2018,"I am not going to rattle on and on in this review . But this should have been the transformers film we got 10 years ago. Good pacing a real story with accurate representations of the original 80's cartoon. These robots actually feel like and look like they could fit into our world . Not to mention the first 10 mins looked better than anything Micheal bay did in the previous films. For people that are not happy with the fact that it was about a girl and her robot . I feel this is just the beginning of some really solid story lines. Its clear that there will be a war on earth . And its clear that the Autobots and Decepticons are on there way here. This film is just there to set the whole thing up for future installments. Which is what Micheal bay never did he just kept throwing laughs and action sequences at us. Also I feel like we excepted Micheal Bays movies because we wanted a live action Transformers film so bad. But technically it barely followed any of the original source material . He basically made his own film with his on robot designs and sold it too us. This film really does feel like a 80's live action of the original cartoon . Watch this film don't miss out especially to see Soundwave, Shockwave, Starscream and Optimus Prime actually done right for once ! This is definitely and exciting moment for real transformer fans . Only reason it didn't get 10 from me is because I would have like to had seen more Characters . But I also understand it is a bumble bee movie.

694,Dethronizer,Transformers done right,10,29 March 2019,"There are two kinds of reviews here:
Ones that were expecitng an orgy of action, and a popcorn movie. They gave it 2/10s because it's not all that.And some that actually KNOW what made Transformers tick back in the day, be it comics or cartoons. For those: you're in for a treat. This is easily the best installment of a blockbuster Transformers movie ever made. It has heart, is cool, awkward, quirky, emotionally loaded, and probably everything that a teen can relate to (I'm forty, but my inner teen smiled through it all). Furthermore, they did justice to the eighties by not overplaying everything to ridiculous levels. The music, the clothing, cars, etc. are dead on.This movie repeatedly hinted at being the first of many, and if they keep up the heart that went into it (because this movie was clearly directed by someone who is an avid Transformers fan), we could see the proper reboot that this title deserved, but failed to get forom the Bay flicks.
I loved it.",Bumblebee

Lmao I agree with the Rotten Tomatoes score. This was actually a pretty good movie even if some wrting was ""generic."" Stop hating on the film to look trendy and have an unpopular opinion. I'm not saying you're not allowed to have your own opinion. You can dislike this film all you want I don't care. But some of the complaints and reasoning for why it wasn't good on here are insnaley ignorant and are just plain full on delusion. It's like I woke up in a braindead world. It's like these people are zombies.Half of the negative ratings here don't provide reasoning as to why they disliked it, some do but it isn't rational reasoning.""Plot is very predictible.""Yes, it sort of was BUT not that predictible. Even if a plot is predictible that doesn't mean a movie isn't good. It can still be enjoyed. Plus other people may not have been able to predict what happened... NEXT!""Not enough action, movie should be named Charlie, etc""Movie was marketed as a buddy movie where they become friends and protect each other, it's legit not suposed to have as much action as the previous films because it's trying to build up character, personality and story achs. Not to mention the low budget of this film compared to the oters. Also there's over 10 minutes of action lmao.I can go on all day about why this movie is good and some reasonings for why it's not are delusions and are irrational comments. But I'm too lazy for that.I strongly suggest you get off your bum and watch this movie! The characters were interesting, CGI, action was impressive, Optimus was badass, Charlie's storyline was emotional, decepticons with personality and colour, writing was actually good, interesting and has comedic moments too. It's very enjoyable and the whole family could watch it. Definitely better than bays films.",Bumblebee

I collected transformer toys as a kid. My favorite toys were Grimlock and Ravage. This movie brought back such childhood nostalgia. I think this one is the best modern Transformer movie and the best Transformer movie since the animated 'Transformers The Movie'. It also tied the modern movies together showing Cybertron before during the war and explaining Bumblebee's voice. I noticed that Bumblebee did play 'The Touch' by Stan Bush that was originally from the animated Transformers The movie (later used in another movie.... I think I was Boogie Nights with Burt Reynolds but I don't know. I am referencing a podcast called Film Spotting that said the song was in that movie) Anyway, I really enjoyed this movie because it worked for me. It brought back such memories of my childhood. I might add that I love movies in general and I recently rewatched E. T. The Extra Terrestrial before watching this and I felt they strangely played together for my mind.

At least with Bay, the viewer isn't kicking themself to stay awake. Yes, it's that boring.This film was just plain boring. While I agree the opening scene is the best part of the film, it's shorter than people think. The opening action is only about 5 mins. After that, The Decepticons that arrive on Earth spend half the film just searching for Bumble Bee. It's an hour of cheap jokes and forced references to the first Transformers film. The romance between Bumble Bee and Charlie was so overt that it got annoying and ambarassing. Memo and Burns do nothing for the film or in the film. Don't even get me started on the amount of plot holes between what was written and what was filmed.I typically cringe what it comes to prequels, and this I was hesistant about.

It's not a good film either.Whether it's because of the writing or the directing is difficult to say, but the movie seems to have been written and directed by people who read about storytelling theory and put it together by following the manual, either because they're too inexperienced or lack the creativity to make something of their own design.
The film ends up consisting purely of cliches, and not really the good kind either.You can't really make people feel something just by telling them what to feel.
If you feel like you've seen the movie before, it's probably because you've seen hundreds of movies following the exact same structure. But as I said - this isn't necessarily a bad thing.

They started out very stylized with a cool black on yellow with a nice green shadow effect, overall they ended up being displayed in a quick fashion that really didn't give viewers enough time to read them. It gave the feeling of those fast credits of a low-budget television program. It was a good movie with a good look to it and deserved better when giving credit to the thousands of contributors to this film. The end credits just weren't a class act befitting a good film like this. They should have cared more about the people who worked on this film, and those who take the time to actually read the end credits.

The non stop cringe from all the clichés actually made me rage quit watching. Don't care about the ending. It can't possibly redeem the movie as a whole. Also, diving? NOBODY CARES!

I've only seen the first one, which before Bumblebee, was universally accepted as the best Transformers movie and the second one which gave us robot testicles. Yeah...And then I saw Bumblebee...This film is wonderful. Every aspect of this movie is better than both of the Transformers movies. The acting is beautiful (especial from Haliee Steinfeld) the cinematography is gorgeous and visible, the soundtrack is incredibly incorporated, the writing is cheesy in all the right ways and everything other aspect is anywhere from good to great. Where as in the others were the acting was offensive, the cinematography was unintelligible and overwhelming, the soundtrack was generic sounds and Linkin Park, the writing is cheesy in all the wrong ways and everything other aspect leaves so much to be desired.To be completely honest, the only true problem I had during the film was a god damn fly crawling across the window to the projection booth. I truly can't think of really problem with this movie. Sure, it can be a little cheesy at times, but the movie makes it clear that it's supposed to be cheesy and it's not just Bay's horrible writing.If you want to know how much better this movie is than the other movies, I'll describe to you one scene in the movie. Spoilers, incase you weren't away of the warning...Charlie (Haliee Steinfeld) is with Bumblebee in her garage and she's trying to repay his radio. While Charlie is doing that, Bumblebee is watching The Breakfast Club and old diving videos. Charlie takes out the diving videos because she doesn't want to watch them. She successfully fixes Bumblebee's radio and plays Take on Me, and song by The Smiths and Never Gonna Give You Up. Bumblebee likes Take on Me, but not the other two. So, Charlie tries to find some more music while Bumblebee sifts through some of the vinyl records hanging from the walls. Charlie stops Bumblebee from doing that and eventually confesses that she hates watching her diving videos and old records because it reminds her of her dead dad. Charlie starts to cry and Bumblebee comforts her.This scene is funny and emotion and even managed to make me forget that Bumblebee was even in the scene in the first place. This scene tries so much more than every. other Transformers movie I have every seen.I can't do this film more justice here. So please, go seen this movie!

I have a flashback from star wars: the force awakens, it had a good rating but the reviews showed you either liked the movie or you hated it, no middle ground.
I feel the same thing here.I liked the movie and i'm one of those people who consider it the best in the franchise. It has heart and tells a story.Yes it has cliches and corny bits and one liners, but hey, that's hollywood right.
Keep in mind it is a movie based on toys...so don't take it too serious.
John cena doesn't fit at all. Somebody promised him a gig and told him he could play the army guy. Sorry john, you may be a nice person in real life, but in this movie you're not very likeable. The salut at the end is embarrassing. A simple ""thank you"" towards bumblebee would have been enough.I read in some reviews people complaining about about not having enough action. That was very refreshing because the michael bay movies (he is only a producer in this one) were basically a shoot em up. The five previous film were five times the exact same movie, just wrapped withe a different ribbon.
And although this movie is kinf of a coming of age movie, it also more than that.
It's a movie about bumblebee, and bumblebee is a protector of the weak. He's not schwarzenegger who shoots up the bad guys with a uzi. He fights when he must. He also not optimus prime, meaning not a leader and the one with muscles. He goofs around and establishes a relationship with this girl.

No way, this movie is for Kids and Not for me. And that makes me cry. Waiting so Long for a movie thats like power Rangers or real steel. So damn sorry.",Bumblebee

751,conner-baker21,Herbie Fully Loaded Meets Iron Giant,2,26 December 2018,"1st. I realize most of the transformer movies are not Hollywood classics. Bad plots, lots of holes, but one thing they almost always deliver on is lots of actions and a fun ride.This was not that. I'm genuinely shocked at the amount of positive reviews. At about 30 minutes in I was ready to walk out. The acting was sub par (don't understand why John Cena continues to get roles), the action was minimal (minus the opening and ending scenes), and the plot was super jumpy and didn't make much sense.I would've rather watched Transformers: Age of Extinction again... and that's saying something",Bumblebee
752,sircarloz,G1 scenes was good but it goes downhill from there,6,18 April 2019,The battle scenes in Cyberton gave me some hope that this movie will be different from Michael Bay's abomination but everything went downhill from there.Starscream or Blitzwing's screentime (whatever they wanna call it) is too short which is a waste because he is one of the enticing factors for me to watch this movie. Instead they rather have two politically correct and drab deceptions acting as bounty hunters. Having a female lead doesn't help the movie at all. So much feminism in a movie loved by boys. Oh well for what it's worth.,Bumblebee
753,stevehellboy,Wah hoo! Take The Iron Giant/Lilo and Stitch/Herbie/Stranger Things and make it into a Transformers movie and you got yourself a hit!,10,29 January 2019,Absolutely loved this movie! What a breath of fresh air from the Michael Bay trash they were feeding us.Travis Knight is a great director. He worked in the animation department for Kubo and two strings and Paranorman. The visuals are perfectly done and the story is superb.The character designs are more than perfect. They pay a huge dedication to the original cartoon series and reinforce what we all know and love about transformers. This includes all the easter eggs they threw in when they showed clips of Cybertron. The cast is great and is a huge improvement to the goofy stuff we've seen before. Hell even John Cena was really fun to watch!Please please please! Make more transformers movies like this! they are so much better :D,Bumblebee
754,MarioSync,Love it,8,6 January 2019,"I watched this with my wife as last movie date of the year, and I was nervous if this was going to be bad movie as like its previous installment, but turns out we are really happy and enjoy the movie, the relationship between Hailee and bumblebee is really fun and enjoy to watch, the action also enough, not too much, John Cena a bit contradicting though, in some of the serious scene, I found his expression is more comical.One really huge big wish that this movie was the start of the whole franchise",Bumblebee
755,silverstormtrix-1,Ordinary Transformers movie that's better than AOE & TLK,6,15 December 2018,"I can said Bumblebee was a great robots character development movie which is a good start for a new trilogy. And for previous Transformers sequel, Michael Bay just keep all sequels focus on human and omitted the importance of Robots character development such as their personalities, behaviour and special weapon system..The most disappointed is he totally shorten the fight scene between Autobots and Decepticons into few seconds only from ROTF to TLK. Bay just used all the budget focus on human military, earth destruction, Aliens Jet and unknown protoform robots which cause all audiences started to feel dislike and hate/hopeless for Transformers movie again.Bumblebee finally give us good robot character development but sadly the human character seems to have more important role in this one. It's feel like a family movie for kids and family, not the thrilling action movie we wanted it to be. The few good stuffs in this was the humanoid robots face that we dislike finally change and deliver us the great robot look like in TF1 and those tiny Transformers are no more. The only things need to improve is the robot battle need to be longer and the Transformers special weapon system need to be more devastated..anyway i believe is the budget matter that caused this. I hope the future instalment would have great robot character development and longer stylish robot battle sequences. I would rate this movie a good 6 star out of 10.",Bumblebee
756,indie0385,"Best Transformers movie, but...",5,26 December 2018,"Yes, this is the best Transformers movie, but the others are such trainwrecks, that isn't saying much. If we judge this movie on its own merits, and not in comparison to the others that came before it, it's...okay. Not great, not terrible.

759,Blazeblack_,"Fake reviews, ridiculous and cringe movie that's not worth of a Transformers title",1,21 June 2019,"I have to agree that Bay's Transformers were just milking the franchise but honestly I didn't mind that all that much, I could still enjoy the mindless action, over the top CGI and most importantly they were at least somewhat believable. This movie has none of it, and does everything else even worse - the acting is cringe and makes the movie feel like a middle school play and everyone's reaction to the giant alien robots is painfully unrealistic (nobody is afraid of them, are you serious?). At the very start of the movie you're greeted with a scene where the robots turn into cars and planes on Cybertron and make the traffic jam jokes without any prior contact with Earth... My immersion was ruined and I was left shaking my head in disbelief 5 minutes in, and even then it was still the best (and by that I mean the only half decent) scene in the movie. It kept getting worse due to the ridiculous acting and horrible humor attempts and I ended up calling it quits after 40 minutes of watching Bumblebee behave like a scared kitten and cringing from the awful dialogue... I've seen some bad movies but this is the first time I couldn't sit through the whole thing... The only logical explanation to the high ratings would be that I've somehow seen a wrong movie because this supposed blockbuster felt like a parody of Transformers that was written by a Fortnite-playing preteen. I'll never be able to wrap my head around why is this movie getting so much praise, it's an insult even to the Last Knight... And just because there's no Michael Bay doesn't mean that it's a good movie. Period.",Bumblebee
760,Tiberite,"Surprisingly enjoyable, fun, well rounded!",8,27 December 2018,"Wow, was really skeptical about this given the trailer (and why do we need a bumblebee movie?).

Worth seeing in theaters.",Bumblebee
761,GabrielBostan,Loved the Movie so much,10,29 March 2019,"I think you are just blind if you think this is a bad movie. It beats so many movies out there and still makes a name for himself.
Firstly, the movie is meant to show us what in happening before Transformers, and how the autobots came to Earth and why Bumblebee is one of the most awesome autobot and more important, how he lost his voice.
I know you expected to see some xxx scene like the other Transformers movie, but that wasn't the point, and you choose to rate this move as ,,bad"".
Secondly, letting aside the fact that is about autobots and saveing the Earth, is about feelings, love and affection.
Not the exact meaning of the words, but we can see how Charlie( Hailee Steinfeld ) is sad and lonely, mourning for his dead father and her dedication for doing something that will make her father proud.
The love for his father pushes her every day, living to repair his car, but one day he discovers the VW who will heal and change her life, making her live again.
Bumblebee acts like a child because his memory circuits are burned and he doesn't know who he is.
The story is base on the connection of the two of them and how they help each others. Charlie heals from her past life wounds and depression because of Bumblebee, and takes care of him and helps him in the fight with decepticons, as he doesn't really know who he is and have problems in thinking.
This is a great movie and deserve a 10/10, but you have to be smart to understand what is happening.",Bumblebee

763,mutantmarine,A Pleasant Surprise.,8,31 December 2018,"I'm not an avid reviewer so I'll keep this short. I've seen almost all the Transformer movies and can say that this one the best out of all of them. Was it perfect? No, but it was damn good.The parts it shined in: the bonding between Charlie and BumbleBee. Feels like they're best pals and the friendship just jives perfectly. I know BB is a CGI character but it felt like there was a connection between the two and it worked. The action, well, is action. As always with Transformer movies, there are explosions, robot fights, etc. For this installment, it wasn't too overdone. They balanced it pretty well. Lastly, John Cena was on and off in this movie. Sometimes the character worked and sometimes it didn't. For the most part though, I feel like his character contributed well to the film. I'm not sure he was intending to act this way, but it always appeared as though he was discrediting what was going on. For example, toward the beginning of the movie (no spoilers), John Cena and his superiors are contemplating working with the Decepticons for a particular reason. He doesn't think it's a good idea, saying ""Their names are Decepticons. Doesn't that alarm any of you? No? Guess not?"" In other moments, it just comes off as corny and bad acting. But meh, it works!The parts that didn't work: the relationship between Memo and Charlie. It felt extremely forced and unnecessary. He didn't contribute anything except for a few corny one-liners for comedic relief. Just cut him out altogether. And lastly, a couple scenes appeared forced in order to progress the storyline further. Bee entering Charlie's home to explore while she's at work, is one of them. It can make you chuckle a bit as he bumbles around breaking everything but the real reason he's in there is to accidentally stick his finger in an outlet and alert the Decepticons of his location. Forced amirite?All in all, the movie was really good. I thoroughly enjoyed it heaps more than all the other Transformer movies. I'm definitely glad I went because I am pleasantly surprised!",Bumblebee

The CGI wasn't nearly as high-quality as what we've seen in the Bay films, and as always the Transformers took a backseat to the humans.

Or how do they learn about English even without stepping onto earth. Or how do they know to call earth earth in cybertron.

The first 10 minutes of the movie started off awesome. Just like the good old days can we please have them back. Then it turned into a 4-way love square between a girl and the cool hot school kid, then a girl and her robot car, and then a boy having a crush on the girl, Which ended with a #meetoo moment as the girl said no and playing hard to get but showing interest. After the first 10 minutes was over and the movie was on its way, I realised this was for kids, but they were some questionable scenes like the girl eating the corn dog and the robots getting seriously killed. Bumble bee dies like 4-5 times and it gets a bit boring. It did feel a bit like a Robot version of ET but just missed the mark with the emotional side but must give credit for how well they made the robot express feelings. Without a doubt the fight scenes were super impressive, looked awesome and you could see what was happening. The fight scene was by far the best part of the movie. If you a kid, I think you will love it and you will get your parent to by you the toys that go with it. If your long-time fan your heart would have opened up in the first 10 minutes and then been crush as the movie lead you on thinking we finally got our child hood back with updated modern day special effects. I hope there can be a balance with their new direction and the the old modern version or just make a movie like the first 10 minutes.",Bumblebee

I like that it was a smaller story. Instead if all tje clutter of some world ending event.John Cena was good, though him being super serious is a tough sell. Hailee Steinfeld was a great choice for the lead. Sorry to Shia, but she was a better protag. The family was annoying, but I guess its the staple of the franchise. Dylan O'Brian was a great voice for Bee. Kinda wish he didnt have to use the radio.If it was the first Transformers in the Franchise it wouldnof been a 10 out of 10. But, since its a prequel.

Same problems with continuity like all the previous ones, we have Bumblebee arriving for the first time on earth in 1987 for example, while in the last Transformers it was revealed that he fought in WW. Less action than other Transformer movies and a bunch of characters i'm not fond of.Luckily a large amount of time is spent on Charlie and her (mostly family) issues, which is boring to watch but it ensures positive critic reviews and the pretentious upvote of people who watch a movie with giant robots from another planet for the ""character development"", so it keeps the franchise alive and kicking for future instalments.",Bumblebee

Which I know sounds like a bad thing, but when you're making a movie based on show meant be a commercial for toys in the 90s you cant really expect high art and originality. For what it's worth, bumblebee is the best transformers movie. The movie is fully aware of its strengths and weaknesses and acts accordingly, it doesn't take itself too seriously and by utilizing the designs of the transformers from the original show it appropriately serves the audience that still goes to see transformers movies.

Surprisingly, the action scenes, although not as many as in Bayformers, are actually better due to Knight's huge experience as an animator. All in all, a delightful movie, which can be compared with the classic movie E.T.",Bumblebee

My kids loved it even my 4 year old watch the whole movie without complaining(thank god cause i didn't want to miss anything). I laughed and cried but i wouldn't have it any other way. Thank you so much for making this movie we really enjoyed it and hope we get the chance of watching more of Bumblebee and the transformers. Never have missed any of the movies and i aint planning too :).",Bumblebee
814,blazerhands,Impressively surprised,10,24 January 2019,"This movie didn't need the sexy babes, the crude humor, or the over the top ""world is at war"" stereotypes that each Transformers movie has tried to do more of during the Michael Bay reign. It was so refreshing to just follow a story with characters that you can't get enough of and see what happens with them and the shy, hilarious, and loving Bumblebee. I hope they redo the whole franchise with the same approach they took on this one.
Fantastic story. Perfect characters/cast. Quality believable action.",Bumblebee

It's like all the cliches of the 80s reborn in a bad try to copy michael bay..The movies name is bumblebee, and I was really excited to learn more about bumblebee as a character.I didn't learn one thing except how he lost his voice.I understand this is a very fresh director.. a little too for future movies is to make something new and your own.. don't steal plots from other movies and put them together in a messed up disappointing e.t copy..The actors is good!

821,victorkon100,A must watch transformer movie,10,16 January 2019,What I enjoyed most was how they used the classic Transformer look in this movie and made it really realistic. They also kept the classic sound when they transformed. It's like my 80's childhood favourite cartoon coming to live in a blockbuster cgi movie. The story was neatly explained without much disconnection. Now I can accept and understand why earth was selected as the base and how bumblebee lost his voice. Movie was rather emotional and i appreciate why they had to use a girl instead of a guy.,Bumblebee
822,dontbesyai-901-781938,It's not a Transformer movie I knew,8,19 December 2018,"I was a fan of Transformer series, yes I was until the 3rd sequel when I was almost falling a sleep during the battle between Optimus Prime and Megatron. For real. Then I skipped the next movies as I have lost my interest.When I saw the trailer of Bumblebee for the first time, I felt 'that movie should be good'. And it is. It's good. It's surprisingly has a real story of the main character, not only war between Transformers and Decepticon which always loud and busy.The movie has many layers and all shown at a good way and portion. The good news is I didn't yawn at all during the movie and it's a good sign for me. Ha ha ha ha",Bumblebee
823,speedmph,Lost and confused,5,27 January 2019,"I honestly thought Micheal Bay made this. Glade to know he didn't, It felt just like one of the other movies I loved. Knowing Bay didn't do this. Does it mean they remaking the movies. Cuz this movie through me off. If you watch TRANSFORMERS: THE LAST KNIGHT. Shows Bumblebee was on Earth way before 1987. Fighting side by side with us. As well as the ending of this movie. Optimus prime and the others don't show up to the year 2000 something six or seven when the first movie came out. Though I thought it was good, since it was off in the start and the ending. I gave it in in-between vote. Good but not good.",Bumblebee
824,gabenight7,Not the same as before.,7,15 April 2019,"This isn't a normal action movie blockbuster. It's definitely more in the slice of life side of things. Which I think the idea of Transformers lends itself to. It's not the original series, it's not the original movies. I wouldn't even call it a transformers movie. It's much more inline with movies like E.T. Go Home than anything else. And that's not bad. The acting was good and the action was good too. Not great by any means and it can be kinda cringey and easy to fault often. But it's not bad as a standalone movie. It's cute and funny. And that's all it's really aiming to be. So if you are looking for the classic non stop action then this isn't your movie.",Bumblebee
825,rooless,Cut and Paste Movie,2,19 January 2019,"Unfortunately this movie is nothing special, it has segments and storylines from all the Transformers movies and put together in the traditional transformers movie. Only thing new are the actors but the story line is exactly the same.",Bumblebee

827,Dragosh_Matei,A very nice Transformers return,9,3 January 2021,"The movie was extremly good, it had jokes, it had intense sequences and it had a nice relationship between the titular Autobot and the human ally Charlie.Charlie's backround (not over her father's death who was ""replaced"" by the mother's new boyfriend) however feels a bit overdone, but even so she and her family are a nice, wholesome human element and a good break from the always heroic Shia LaBeouf and Mark Wahlberg.Memo was also good, I liked seeing how he was so anxious and uncertain about how to talk to Charlie and their relationship wasn't rushed, seeing as how she said she wasn't ready for a small thing such as handholding (and he was very understanding about it, a behavior that I'm glad was shown).And the Transformers? Truly amazing, they looked good, had good voices and their fights were a little more dynamic than before! The best part is that now they are easier to understand physically than in the original movies series.Overall, a very enjoyable movie and a nice comeback for the Transformers franchise!",Bumblebee

830,attilaboncok,Following its predecessors' path,6,13 September 2020,"People were hoping for a reboot of the franchise. While it might be technically a reboot, it does pretty much the same things as the previous movies.
While the center of the story should be the Autobots and the Decepticons, humans having a kind of a support role, the movies, including Bumblebee, keep humans in the front. Probably to cater to the average moviegoer.
The problem is that the average moviegoer doesn't really care about the real Transformers story. He/she just wants to watch a decent action movie.
The average moviegoer enjoys the movie for those 2 hours, then forgets the whole movie, because he/she doesn't care about it.
Those who would be invested in the franchise, get something that isn't really Transformers.
So in the end, no one cares about these movies. Bumblebee failed at changing that, or actually, didn't even try to.A watch-once-then-forget decent action movie, following the same path as the previous ones.",Bumblebee
831,jasonniebergall,Michael Bay did it better!,5,26 December 2018,Yeah I said it. Bay's Transformers & Transformers Dark of the Moon are far better films. Bay got it. He understood what the franchise was about as well as what fans wanted. Bumblebee is visually astounding & comical enough. Overall passable. I'm sorry it does not hold a candle to Bay's previous masterpieces. The commercials stating best Transformers ever are pure bait. Don't bite.,Bumblebee

But there's a good music use, even though it causes editing problems in some moments. It's the first Transformers movie that I've watched and I quite enjoy it. Fight choreography between Bumblebee and two Decepticons in the final part is quite enjoyable and well-choreographed.

Wish it would've been a bit more serious instead of it always having to be the teenage underdog cliché, with military cliché personnel that only wants to kill and experiment on everything even tho autobots are vastly superior.The only information Powell managed to get to Burns was they'd made a mistake and the bots where enemies, yet he just let Bumble go without any explanation as to why it saved him, who's the baddies etc. Nah, just let the super advanced robot that could potentially destroy the planet go.And i think they forgot about the car that Charlie was fixing, because in like 10 secs, she completely overhauled it.Besides the annoying stuff the movie wasn't bad, but could've been better.",Bumblebee

It's not perfect by any means, but being a fan of the franchise and a fan of film I think most people will find a good balance between a good story with strong characters and awesome transformers action the series is known for.THE GOOD
The best part of this movie is the cybertron scenes without question. Even through they are limited, it is a dream come true for any transformers fan.
The relationship between bumblebee and Charlie is great. Hailee Steinfeld gives a fantastic performance and really makes you feel for a human character for once
The acting is solid for the most part. No one did a poor job IMO but the supporting cast could have done better but they did fine for what it was.THE BAD
I didn't hate anything in this movie like I did in Michael Bays other films but some jokes in this movie didn't land and could have been cut out completely.
Like I said no one did a terrible job with acting but I feel the family aspect could have been trimmed down or have been written better. Besides Charlie's relationship with her father I didn't care about anyone else in the family
And the last negative is that this script is very similar to ""The iron giant"" and ""E.T"" and I can't look over the comparisons but it didn't really bother me that muchFINAL VERDICTBumblebee is a movie I really love. It has awesome action scenes and a great human and robot relationship that is beautifully executed. Some acting is better than others and comparisons can be drawn from other movies but it is still definitely worth watching.9/10",Bumblebee
844,jerinsullivan,"Different direction, Hasbro Origins story",8,20 January 2019,"Bumblebee was good, not great, but better then average. It was definitely better then the last Transformers outing! This movie is not part of the Michael Bay canon, it's part prequel/origins, part reboot. The action and eye candy has been toned down, and the story telling and focus to detail has been ratcheted up. Children of the 80's who played with the original toys will feel nostalgic seeing Optimus, Soundwave, Shockblast and others portrayed in all their G1 glory (albeit only for a short time on Cybertron in the first 5 minutes of the film.) Bumblebee and Charlies friendship is heartfelt and genuine and her family aesthetic, in the midst of her fathers recent death is turbulent. John Cena is honestly less then stellar in his performance but adequate for the role he fills. He lacks the three dimensional acting chops to successfully navigate the multitude of emotions needed to do much more then that required of his character. I do recommend this movie to all Transformers fans, either of the toys or of the Bayformers movies. You'll enjoy it! Just don't expect it to be something it is not meant to be and hold it to ridiculously high standards. It is a movie based on toy robots that transform into cars, who have found Earth, have to exist among humans, and deal with the consequences--period.",Bumblebee

Finally they look and sound like the cartoon versions.
Optimus and Bumblebee looked great, and Soundwave was a fantastic surprise!
Some of the acting was a little over the top, but it was all about Bee and Charlie.
Fingers crossed there will be a sequal to this, and then one to follow that so we can forget all about the other movies from the franchise.",Bumblebee

854,alejandrokilei,"Best transformers movie; best ""superhero"" movie out",10,1 January 2019,"This has been the best transformers movie by far and the best movie currently out in theaters. It has a solid story, good comedy, and does not overuse CGI. There's a few scenes on cybertron which heavily use CGI. Luckily, when it gets to earth it blends a lot better and there's also a good mixture with models. This has been a relief as many movies in recent years just feel like you are watching a video game...
Honestly, this movie has the most solid story line of all the movies currently out. It's more of a coming of age story with transformers thrown into the mix. Also, you could follow the story throughout and did not feel like they were making it up as they went along. There were also some really fantastic scenes of watching the transformers turn into their various forms.
In conclusion, fantastic movie that breathed new life into the transformer franchise. Definitely better than any movies put out by DC or MCU (which, if it wasn't for fandom, would be equivalent to Michael Bay rag tag films).",Bumblebee

857,mralexrowe,Quick Reviews say - On the rise,9,2 February 2019,"The drastic change of storytelling partly thanks to Spielberg has moved the franchise on the right track.
Transformers need to be inspiring, connected to people, emotionally, and what was lacking in previous movies, here it starts to shine.
The 80's were interesting placement as to the technology was dated than, and it shows how the story began, but i somehow feel something was lacking, and that Bumblebee could had given more.There was very little shown related to the transformers technology so sci-fi element took a big dive down. And action was a bit underwhelming, one would think we would see tanks instead of humvees and more realistically shown consequences as to the aliens invading the earth. Something to think on.
Acting was spot on and its what put this above the average.
Story is focused on a more rebelious younger age audience where it should be, but it retains enough of action and funny elements to be watchable by everyone.
I feel this could be the start of something we can look forward to.
Aside from the first instalment, Michael Bay movies were action only, story and charm later, well now we get both the charm and the story, hopefully the immersion stays on this level for the future movies.",Bumblebee

None..The bad:
The comedy is NOT funny atall, there's a scene in the kitchen were Bee makes a mess with coffee etc.. that's as funny as it gets and it is not funny
There is minimal to no action atall for a good hour. It's transformers but seems to have been made into ""Girl finds herself after finding a robot, a coming of age tale""
They seemed to have found the most white looking black/Mixed man in America to play the love interest, it's getting to the point were you can guess this from the cast line up alone, inevery single modern film, like there's an agenda...The Ugly:
Transformers was a toy franchise aimed at children. Michael Bay captured it perfectly, some complained but as he said, he made it an action film for kids and teenagers, that I for one enjoyed as an adult for mindless cgi over the top action, not every film requires some deep meaning.
The plot is dull. The action a shadow of Michael Bays. The love interest predictable and programmed. Packaged as a romance coming of age for a teen girl this is not a transformers film, it could have been a B-rated sci fi if not linked to transformers.The fact they've had to lay for these reviews as well, I'd love to see an IP trace on them I guarentee they would all be grouped

The 3rd one had a great third act in Chicago but that's about it. I went into this with good expectations and was not disappointed. I can finally say we have a second good Transformers movie with this standalone Bumblebee movie. This is a movie with a lot of heart and that's not just due to Bumblebee but also with the human characters. They finally got a great lead with Hailee Steinfeld who gives a damn solid performance in this. The entire cast was good no one seemed like they were phoning it in for a paycheck, except maybe Cena, who was kinda like a stone, but that maybe just him being him. The action in this movie is a major step up from the sequels, you can actually tell what's going on and the visuals are beautiful and detailed. And then there is a really good 80's vibe, with the correct music, scene's, clothing.. hell, everything! I was ecstatic to see they went back with the Generation 1 designs.

873,kash_man_e,What a terrible movie!,4,21 January 2019,"What was this?! Character development and drama is important but this just takes the biscuit! I cant believe this was so highly rated! The direction is absolutely terrible! The story very very sub par! Almost looked like a college film project.
I have a feeling this was more satire than serious. I mean, for anyone interested in serious sci-fi this is just pathetic. Steer clear if you want a well thought out, well written movie!",Bumblebee

875,fayrilium,Could have been so good,6,23 December 2018,"I didn't expect much so I wasn't disappointed. But this movie could have been much better!The cinematography perfectly matched the story's teenage Californian summer vibe, as did the 80s soundtrack.But when it came to character development there was none. The dynamic between Charlie and her family is predictable and one dimensional. The plot was thin and unimpressive and didn't create any sense of tensive or mystery.Most disappointing was the dialogue which was cringe worthy because it was so cliche and unimaginative.If only they writers spent more time developing the characters and plot this would have been good. But the first Transformers is still the best of the franchise.",Bumblebee
876,psxmeup,Back to the roots?,9,30 December 2018,"I really hope they reboot the franchise and go back to the Marvel comic book/cartoon roots. There was always something magical about the old transformers. Maybe because the old robots had a greater purpose because of their origin, which didn't come from some stupid ""cube"" that turned toasters into sentient machines. It came from a great battle between the spirits of destruction and life. Of course, the movie doesn't need to go over the Primus vs. Unicron story line - they only need to allude to it. I'm also glad they redesigned the transformers. They looked like a hunks of junk in previous movies. Really psyched over this.",Bumblebee
877,alexmason468,Great movie if you take the humans out,5,30 December 2018,"The opening scene on Cybertron is amazing, especially for anyone who remembers the cartoons from their childhood. Then the humans get involved and they're pretty poor. Hailey Steinfeld apart. Especially John Cena
The movie goes about setting up the story for Michael Bays original which is unfortunate as many like myself wanted this to be a reboot.
Setting it in the 80's was amazing with pop culture references and a cracking soundtrack but it's not enough for me. Shame but it missed the mark",Bumblebee
878,SamFink,Best one so far!,8,3 March 2019,"Finally!Almost all of the other live action Transformers movies gave audiences no time to connect with the characters, were filled with long action sequences to make up for lack of story and felt like a competition to see how much product placement they could ram into a film.Bumblebee however was an enjoyable action film and after the continuous disappointment of the Transformers franchise is a breath of fresh air!If you've a old school Transformers fan like I am and have been waiting for a decent addition to the film series, this is it.Enjoy",Bumblebee

Acting was mediocre but I'm always glad to see new actors getting a chance at Hollywood. Plot was painfully boring and many scenes just didn't make sense. Probably a good movie for little kids. Being an x mechanic I appreciated all the details of the robot, referencing real car parts in when in robot form. Growing up listening to 80/90s could relate to the music (though not a music buff). Hopefully the next transformer movie will be a little more interesting.",Bumblebee

883,lewis0910,An absolute disgrace to the Transformers franchise.,5,20 May 2019,"This is not a transformers movie.
Their's hardly any action, no big explosions, no huge fight scenes. Nothing.
It's a ""nice"" film and that's it.
The characters are ok and the acting is decent but that's about it.I actually found myself getting bored halfway through which shouldn't happen and has never happened before during a transformers movie.
How anyone can hate on Michael Bay and say the other Transformers movies are trash is probably the reason this movie was made and thats why it fails to be a transformers movie.
Watching this movie makes you realise just how good Michael Bay is and proof that he makes the best action movies, period!!
I recommend to anyone new to the franchise to skip this and go straight to the real ""Michael Bay"" transformer movies.
You won't regret it.",Bumblebee
884,gandalf-legolas,Thank God they picked their game up!,8,29 March 2019,"The opening scene is intense, we really haven't see much of the cybertron in the previous movies, so it was nice to see some of the fighting there. Moving on, the first fighting scene on earth is intense with a vintage Bumblebee type scenario where he always comes up with the goods to destroy foes bigger and better than him via a moment of magic. From there on, the movie picks up on the emotional element in a very subtle way. I think this movie is much more balanced than the previous ones, all those people giving negative reviews and complaining about weak dialogues and plots are just actually expecting too much from a transformer movie. You literally can't expect fighting Robots to be throwing one liners like Mr. deadpool or the Starlord. The movie is not as action packed as the previous ones, the soundtracks are actually very nice and the 80s music hits you right in the feels. I really liked their new approach on the movie. However the villains are very weak. I hope they can build up from here.",Bumblebee

I am really in shock for seeing this movie. I hoped for just a little bit more.",Bumblebee
886,Eco-Sophist,So glad I don't treat critics like the Gospel before deciding what to watch.,8,11 February 2020,"This was a movie about how difficult it is when you've lost a parent while you are still young. That was me. I got her character not wanting anyone to replace your father, while at the same time being grateful when someone understands your pain and helps you through it.
It didn't need oscar-nominated acting, or non-stop ear-popping (plot-skipping) action to tell that story. I am a sci-fi buff, and have seen most notable movies in that genre. And admittedly it did play on the boy-and-his-dog (but this time a girl) pretty heavily, But I still liked it a lot. I was also sure that this wasn't a Michael Bay movie before checking on IMDB, because this one was too subtle for that.
And I'm glad about it.
This gets a 8 for me just because it found a different way to tell a Transformers story that was more human, and made a statement about something more important than Cybertron.",Bumblebee

I felt like there was just way too much drama, and that most of it was just unbelievable. Bumblebee gets the crap beat out of him more times than I'm willing to count, and then comes back in the next scene good as new. Could someone explain? I imagine it would be a great movie for an adolescent girl. For anyone else, too much sad sap puppy dog kind of junk. I felt like the actors were reading from cue cards at points of the movie. At the end, it was way too predictable. Sorry, I wanted to like it.",Bumblebee

894,VisionofHope,Bumblebee doesn't really have 'the touch',6,22 December 2018,"Though Bumblebee is filled with heart and touching moments between Charlie and Bumblebee, thanks to the efforts of Travis Knight. The disappointing aspects of the movie overshadow the good parts.The movie felt like a dull, generic, contrived 80's film at times, complete with high school bullies, an idiot military and a useless love interest to develop Charlie's story.I felt like the movie was missing something after finishing it.I'm always asking for more heart in movies, but for once I thought it could have used more action. The first half of the movie is amazing (Cybertron and Blitzwing hunting down Bumblebee) and shows great promise, but there's too many areas for improvement.Things such as the Decepticons, who could have had more personality besides sadism, John Cena's character could have gradually had a change of heart rather than the black and white transition of: hating bumblebee and then accepting him after the Autobot saves him.If he actually used his brain for a moment and realized a 'dangerous criminal' wouldn't be shielding a young girl, then his character could have been more than the angry, military type.If you do decide to watch this movie as a Transformers fan, please adjust your expectations so you won't be disappointed.",Bumblebee

902,Angelagudelo1,Best Transformers movie,9,21 May 2019,"I will start off by saying I am biased of this franchise due Transformers being a major part of my childhood.With that being said, I will say that taking away the fandom part of the series, this is the best movie out of all of them . The first 3 minutes, makes us old G1 transformers geeks fall in love with the movie with seeing a lot of the old characters... like Braun, Wheeljack, Ratchet, Soundwave, Shockwave, etc.... in their original G1 bodies ... so anyone who loved transformers will be hooked to the movie just bc of those three minutes ..
Hailee did a great job in her acting compared to a screaming Shia LeBeouf ( however you spell it) and Mark Whalberg , plot was very nice with how they added this story back from the 80's from when Bee arrived on earth... the villains , i was not too fond of but they weren't bad .. but if you saw the original transformers movie by Michael Bay then you can tell the outcome of the movie ..Enjoy the movie !!!",Bumblebee

The movie isn't slow-motion porn for fans of cheap action cinema it wants to be more than that. It is the attempt to make more out of the franchise and to orientate oneself on role models like Ion Giant or ET. Apparently and also unfortunately this doesn't go well with the fans, they criticizes the bad acting and the dump plot (What irony to get upset about that in a transformer movie).
So the next movie will probably be just another 0815 action blockbuster that you forgot when leaving the cinema, too bad because Bumblebee has shown that the franchise can do more than that.",Bumblebee

My review might be biased as bumblebee is my favorite transformer! Now that this is out of the way, I must say I was very pleased and surprised by the movie. It's very uplifting and different. It lacks the gritty dark eerie qualities of the previous transformers movies, nevertheless it still is a transformers movie with explosions and such.Good things about the movie:
Uplifting and cuteHas soulVery family friendly80s vibes (there are many goofs but the vibe is still there)Bad things about the movie:

And they tried real hard to make everything look like it really was in 1987. The music, the furniture, cars, even the product placement...

What can I say this movie was great, the action was reasonably edited and looked good, the story was predictable,generic and done other times, but it felt authentic and heartwarming. This time there actually was an interesting human character. Overall I really enjoyed the movie, it's allot simpler than the last few movies, no mcguffin which was refreshing just some of the jokes and dialog was a hit and miss. If you want another idiotic plot with crusaders, greek mythology with explosions, and robots killing Stalin this isn't the transformer movie for you, but if you want a movie with a simple story about a robot and a girl with some action here and there, you will enjoy this. 9/10 just for simple nitpicks and bad jokes.

But when i do, there is one thing i do that some forget to leave at the door. I leave any undeserved feelings at the door. So, unlike huge amounts of negative viewers on the last transformers movies, i don't get mad just because Michael Bay is part of the movie. And if we are really being honest the only thing any director of a big budget movie in the past 50 years has done is be a good hand puppet to the executives board that makes the actual decisions. First off, anyone who gave this anything over a 7.0 rated it too high simply because Michael bay isn't part of it. Nearly every 10 starts with...... thankfully Michael Bay wasn't part of this. Secondly, anyone who rated it lower than a 6.0 is simply overreacting to the negative aspects that made me give it a 6.0. The positive aspects are that the movie is not forcing an action scene on you every 5 mins. The movie feels more like an adventure which is a great feel. Their very first meeting feels like charlie is encountering a wounded animal. The action is subtle but rightfully put. Cena was funny for about a min which ends for the rest of the movie. After that it's, serious Cena. The negative aspects are that the movie doesn't have enough action going around. Too much like a PG attempt for an alien robot and human first meet. The brutality was on a serious mature scale in the last movies in comparison. The level of graphic content in here feels like a Mortal Kombat with no blood or guts. Comedy is another thing you don't see alot of in the movie. At least anything noteworthy. Especially in comparison with the others. All in all, a majority should like this movie. Not love it. And certainly not hate it. Worth a watch and multiples with other first time viewers. Leave it in the collection. And watch it again when a similar movie reminds you of it months or years later.",Bumblebee

They don't line up at all and play way too much on the ""transformers have been here for a long time"" crap. This movie was everything we as Transformers fans deserve and needed.

Great visual effects, much clearer fighting logic (that chains can actually finish transformers), and great fighting design (specifically how bumblebee, despite small, takes down larger enemies). The human part... is disappointing. Charlie Watson could have been replaced by any other character and the movie will still make sense (really, diving into water would NOT help 2 tons of metal to get back to the surface. B-137 did it himself). Travis Knight probably wants to put in some elements to appeal to the young, but all those elements seem slow, meaningless, and boring.

+It's the most family friendly movie from the franchise. Friends or Family. Watch it with your loved ones. Great for adults, kids and of course, for returning Transformers nerds. You simply can't miss this. A perfect weekend getaway.
+The story is unique and marks its own niche in the Transformers series introducing the beginning to a remarkable 21st century robot warfare to new watchers. It's role in the upcoming movies cannot be denied.
+Hailee Steinfeld and John Cena are starring. What else do you even need? The acting was critically appreciated. Even the secondary characters make their mark and emphasize their presence in the movie.
+It's bold, visually stunning, fast paced and positive.
+Utterly humorous, you just have to watch it to get your daily dose of laughter.
+Expresses 'the teenage year' emotions in a powerful and candid manner. Hailee looks so young and beautiful. Second to none performance.
+The '80s setting speaks about the culture, lifestyle, technology and pop culture obsession.
+You can't miss it for the Easter eggs, cameos and Optimus Prime.
+The movie does justice to the comics, books, film franchise, video games taking out the best of everything and a delivering a wonderfully crafted story.
+Action packed, adrenaline rush battles that will immerse you into the watching experience. Perfect for Micheal Bay fans.
+The soundtrack will get your head nodding.
+The ending will inspire you. Definitely. The climax perfectly fits the past and the future of the Transformers Franchise. This movie takes the expectations a notch higher so the following TF movies need to be at least this good or better!
-Some Cliches. Not much but noticeable.

921,kcanon-58634,Great movie,10,17 December 2019,Ignore the low rating losers on here. My husband is a fan of transformers let me say even seen the old transformer movie (1984). All them look just like the original. Those want something new guess what this transformer and anything made into live action will never have a new story line. This is the story what happen to Bumblebee when he landed on Earth before the others came. Why does bumblebee act like a child because he lost his memories just like a normal person. When lose your memories you tend start from a child that's how they made him so he can learn. This is basic common sense. This pretty much just like the first transformer movie just a introduction to bringing out a second movie.

922,kcanon-58634,Forgot add to my last review,10,17 December 2019,The only Bay movie was worth watching was the first two. This like the prequel to the first movie. If this boring then those with low reviews are not true fans. They would know this how the original transformers looked like. Go back and watch the original series and the movie (1984) look and watch the story line and see what they looked like. Also want something new go find a new movie this is just like a remake of the tv show/movie. Millennials and gen whatever you guys are called were not even born yet go buy Bays movies shouldn't even review this movie at all.

Never have done one of these but felt compelled due to my disappointment and hope that people making movie decisions listen. First few minutes really had me going... great old school Cybertron warring. Then... long and boring. Although the movie was only 114 minutes it felt like an eternity. Terrible acting. John Cena is terrible. The rest of the actors were way too dumb and clueless. Major failure of attention to detail. I'm prior military and have a thing about getting anything military depicted correctly... major fail here. Zero effort in that department. Plot was completely too simple just like it was in the 30 minute cartoons. I suppose if I was still a kid growing up in the 80's I would find this exactly like the cartoons but cool due to it being lifelike. Why not a 1 then? They did roll out this version better and much more closely to what i remember as a kid than the previous few films. I suppose it's heading in a better direction. I can see them correcting the issues I listed above making it what it should be. Problem is that they have the ratings being super high in here. 92% and 7/10? Really?,Bumblebee
925,palpunto,Bla bla bla,2,18 December 2018,"Lets make a movie based in the 80s,where we have the SAME argument as the first Transformers movie.Poor Bumblebee( better call it Bumblecat,because of its Nine Lives),who gets randomly discovered by a Freak with no friends and finally beats up the two evil and dumb bad asses(does this all ring a bell?)SPOILERS
There are giant Plot Holes and the movie sometimes make no sense at all.For example,the bad guys are in a Military Facility and the girl and her friend break up only by cutting a piece of a fence.No policemen at all.
John Cena decides to attack the bad guys only with a Helicopter,while the rest of the Police just Sleeps and arrive way much later.And the Decepticon decides not to attack right away,but to hide from him...
The girl is being held by the police in her room which she finds alone when she wakes up and no surveillance..
There is a Transmision and of course,there is a Count Down despite the fact is Decepticons Technology...
Bumblebee dies and lives again and almost gets DROWNED....
Why does Optimus appears at the end and not before? and how did he scape from the bad guys?
What did they smoke when they did that? They tried to compensate with some cute moments,the typical bulls...about a broken girl with traumas....
Omly 2 Stars because of the Special Effects...",Bumblebee
926,stan-alexandru,Did NOT expect it to be like this!,10,22 December 2018,"I always liked the Transformers movie franchise, like a lot of people do, and was extremely disappointed with the direction they were going with it after the first 2 movies. When I saw that they're doing a prequel with Bee, I thought ""oh well, might as well prepare myself for another mediocre movie..."". Today it premiered here, so I went to see it, not having any high expectations. But oh boy, was I surprised! The movie was absolutely great, I enjoyed every minute of it, I think it was a perfect balance of humor, action and touching moments. The characters were also very good, even Cena. Furthermore, this time they finally slowed down the transformations, it's much cooler this way and you can clearly see they paid attention to details. I highly recommend it to any Transformers fan, but also to anyone looking for a good movie to enjoy, it does worth every penny and the time to watch it. Great job!",Bumblebee

I went in with expectations to hate it, because to be honest, I hated all the transformers movies. However this one exceeded my expectations. It was lighthearted, funny, but also full of action and adventure from the very opening scene. The music was spot on, and the accuracy of the 80's feel was also. The one downfall to this movie was John Cena. I can't really undertand the point of having him in this movie. His acting is terrible, he takes away from the authenticity of the movie with his corny facial expressions and lines. Had he not been in this, I would've given it a 9/10. His scenes were cringeworthy and hard to watch. Other than that, great movie, and much better than Michael Bay's take on the films.",Bumblebee

Kept thinking to myself that it's going to be the worst one yet... but in the end, I am so glad that I went to see it because it was so much better then I expected. The graphics was pitch perfect and stuck true to the original series for the robots. The soundtrack took me back to my childhood, grew up on a lot of the music that they used. The story is actually really entertaining, not the best that they could come up with but definitely, DEFINITELY not the worst. The cast would have to be the best part, very good acting for the most part. The movie has the right amount of cheesiness to it, not to much, not to little, the way Transformers should be. Overall I very much enjoyed this, and would say that there is some places that they could have improved the movie a bit more.",Bumblebee

Storyline is solid, although I'd say conservative. Acting was really well done, and the interaction with the 2 main characters is so heartwarming, you'd forget one of them is actually a robot. Bumblebee is not just a nice story about friendship, but about acceptance and pushing through adversity of any type. The accurate details in which this film brought back the characters and the story from the original comic series is overwhelming - I felt myself wanting to stand and cheer. This is the film they should have started with, and built from here. Will definitely add this to my treasured collection when it is digitally available. Kudos to the entire team who brought us this soon-to-be classic.",Bumblebee

958,zano-99916,Blinded by nostaligia?,1,18 April 2019,"I have found by looking into other reviews that the majority of people are giving this a 6/10 because of how much better than the Michael Bay films it is, but I was incredibly disappointed with the direction of the film after the first 10 mins. Weren't people upset that the other movies gave most of the screen time to the humans? I swear that 90% of this movie is like watching a cheesy low budget live action Disney movie and 10%(being generous) is the character development and payoff that we actually needed. From a cinematic point of view there was so much unneeded writing that weighed it down. They tried to cash out on an emotional scene that was way too early and that they didn't even invest in. The plot was too congested with characters that we were supposed to care about, but as an example I was left wondering where did the popular kids go? What was the point in trying to introduce them and wasting that much time on side stories that never went anywhere? I understand that she is the outcast. Yes, I can see how she dresses in black and doesn't get along with her family. The movie could have worked so much better if they had only focused on 3 human characters for development and the audience would actually care about them (grease monkey girl, ""nerd"" boy, and military man). Instead the movie has the overall feel of poorly written fan fiction that no one asked for. I wish that the next person that makes these realizes that live action transformers movies don't need to be packed with humans for us to watch it. I would have gladly watched what the intro was, but as an entire movie. I wouldn't care that it's cgi because the transformers themselves have more than enough lore and backstory in order to fill a two hour movie. One thing that I did like about the movie was the intro and the transformers scenes where bumblebee wasn't a dog. I'm not mad, just very disappointed that there were only a handful of scenes that I liked. I also noticed the movie trying to make me feel nostaligia for the 80's because I suppose they thought it would make up for their lackluster writing? (It looks like it worked after looking at some of the blindly positive reviews). I can't understand how people can compare this to E.T. or the iron giant except maybe from the nostalgia factor. I am glad that I didn't pay money to see this movie, but I regret wasting my time during the hour and thirty minutes in the middle of it. I gave this movie a 1/10 because that's the ratio of screen time of transformers v humans.",Bumblebee

There's one part at the begging where bumblebee says ""run"" and the way he said it along with the outlining dramatic effects added such as music. Camera placment tension and such caused my heart to pump a little harder and my hair to raise. They didn't hire an over the top unrealistic bad acting model to play the girl just a regular I'll be it pretty girl but rather normal girl who was a good actor. It was funny. Action scenes where great John Cena was lovable enough for me to forget how horrible of an actor he is. The CGI was great only one CGI part I thought could've been better.

The Transformers themselves actually looked like their G1 cartoon counterparts. Soundwave even had his original voice and seeing Ravage gave me goosebumps even if it was a brief scene.People saying it was too kiddie obviously never saw the cartoons that were guess what... made for kids, surprise right?!? How dare they.This movie had all the makings of an episode stretched out. The morality issues, the life lesson, the decepticons take some sort of electrical base/tower etc. followed by a narrow win for the autobots including some sort of honorable self sacrifice. All the things I loved in episodes as a kid.If this is a reboot and the first of a new series in this fashion I will be very pleased. I absolutely loved every minute of it and it brought me back to when I was a kid which is exactly what a live action Transformers film should do. I mean when I saw Bee roll up beside that big old truck at the end of the film it looked so good it gave me shivers. I knew exactly who it was.All in all if you are hating on this movie do yourself a favor and go back and watch the G1 series that this movie pays homage to. Maybe after that you will get it.

983,synapticflow,What a difference between KNIGHT and bay. Finally!,9,17 February 2019,"Travis Knight, you did it! Bumblebee is the ONLY live action Transformers movie!
Forget all the trash that came before (I guess the first bay-formers movie was ok) but Travis Knight is a true believer.Bumblebee was a love letter to fans of the original Transformers. Travis Knight understood what the fans have always wanted and he delivered it to us in great doses. We got the see the Transformers as they should be; looking like real robots instead of the ugly horror skeleton trash-bots of the Michael Bay movies.The 80s setting and music only added to the charm of this movie.
It was thrilling seeing so many of our favorite characters and meeting a few new ones. Hailee Steinfeld was an adorable character that you could cheer for and sympathize with over the course of her story arc.I had no problem at all with John Cena. He wasn't given a ton to do, but this movie isn't meant to be an exercise in Shakespearean elitism. He did his part just fine and so did the rest of the cast.There was great action, great special effects, and a solid, heartwarming story.I wanted so SO bad for this to be a full reboot instead of a prequel. Just imagine being able to get more of this in the future and no more Michael Bay.
But I believe Bay jealousy put his foot down and demanded that this movie tie in with his terrible films. That is why we didn't get to see Megatron on Cybertron in the Bumblebee movie.I hope All Spark pictures can work some magic and wrangle this away from the previous Transformers universe and make it continue as its own thing.I can't wait to pick up the blu-ray. Be sure to check out that soundtrack to!",Bumblebee

985,bearcakehorror,"A good movie, but not a great one",7,8 April 2019,"Transformers 1 was okay, good action, bad characters, bad writing, too long, but good action (First time Optimus and Megatron in live action too) and The later movies were horrible. Transformers became almost a joke like the Resident Evil movies at that point (Last Knight) and it deserved better than that. In my opinion, Bumblebee is finally that better movie I was looking for, at least to Transformers movies standard.Bumblebee starts really strong with great transformers classic designs and some great looking actions non-stop. After that, it switches to Charlie, the main protagonist, which is fine since it makes us care of her situation to introduce the change Bumblebee will bring into her life later in the movie. The movie then introduced the now iconic transformer and then it slows down... A lot. Bumblebee is mainly used from Charlie's perspective, which makes us care more of their relationship and I think the movie succeeds on that front. On the other hand, you have the army men and 2 Decepticons and that storyline takes a while to get interesting. It brings the pacing down because the movie can't decide if it wants to be an action thriller or a personal movie and even though it kind of worked out in the end, a more fast paced approach would've worked in the movie's favor (Like maybe introduce the two decepticons with a fight scene instead of the end of the fight or something like the Helicopter transformer in T1 which was a cool action scene). Don't even get me started with Charlie's family please. You can clearly feel the writing is done by someone who has almost close to none experience yet and that movie was a bit too big for her.In the end, Bumblebee succeeds in making me care for Charlie and her relationship to Bumblebee, I can't say the same thing for Bay's characters in all movies.
It has not so great side characters, really forgettable. The two decepticons are far from Megatron and lack cool characteristics. The army men are cliche and there's not enough action (not necessarily fights). But all in all, Bumblebee is a step in the right direction for sure, It makes me want a Transformers movie happening in Cybertron exclusively. I enjoyed my watch and will probably buy it when it'll be 10$, but I also don't want another teen-focus Transformers movie, Please stay away from those protagonist.
7 out of 10, recommend! Please do a Beast Wars movie!",Bumblebee
986,haricharanK,'Dumb'lebee.,1,4 January 2019,"Bumblebee is a boring film. An annoying protagonist who seems to cry at everything happening around her and a dumbed down giant robot who alternates between behaving like a baby and a pet dog. John Cena is just used as the PA system, barking instructions such as 'Shoot!' or 'Chase!'. There is absolutely nothing new to see and it's just a lazy attempt at capitalising on the recent craze towards 80s nostalgia. Can completely avoid.",Bumblebee

989,goldandblackx,People who have this above a 3/10 are out of their minds.,3,4 April 2019,"Okay so, this is literally The Edge of Seventeen with a puppy dog robot. Her father dies of a heart attack, just like in Seventeen. She has a nerdy boy courting her the whole movie, just like in Seventeen. She has a family who alienate her, just like in Seventeen. She deals with the after effects of losing her father the whole film, just like Seventeen. Most of this film felt stolen to me. The red eyes when B gets mad (The Iron Gaint). The Karate chops from the younger brother in the car (Smokin' Aces). Plus, why does John Cena get rolls in Hollywood? He's the worst. That salute at the end made me want to puke. The action scenes were bland, nothing we haven't seen before. Michael Bay did it way better. The heartfelt stuff was cheesy and poorly written. The Decepticons aren't scary any more and the red one was a rip off of Proxima Midnight from Infinity War. Or at least it felt that way. Hailee is the only good thing about this movie. But I've already watched her preform this roll in Seventeen. So basically, if you've seen that, then don't even bother with this dumpster fire.",Bumblebee

Good story, likable characters and great action. Yeah... I could actually tell what was going on during the fight sequences. I could actually tell the Transformers apart. It didn't look like, as Homest Trailers put it... ""two radio shacks doing Kama Sutra in a hurricane"".I actually cared about the human characters. They weren't just yelling over each every freaking time they talked like in every freaking Michael Bsy Transformers movie! The Transformers were written like actual characters with arcs and personality instead of ""generic robot"" or ""racially stereotypical"" characters. And the characters, humans and Transformers alike had actual coherent dialogue. Instead of yelling or stuttering their lines all the freaking time.I genuinely loved and enjoyed this movie and I'm gonna recommend it to ANYONE who hated most of the ""Bay-Formers"" ones!! Definitely gonna rewatch this again!! If THIS is the future of the Transformers franchise.... Then Count me in!!!!

Loved Hailee as Charlie (pretty sure she's slowly becoming one of favorite actors along with one of my favorite singers/artists), and Bumblebee was pretty incredible too of course. Lots of action, a bit of sadness, but in the end this movie was absolutely fantastic and I absolutely cannot recommend this movie enough to anyone, even those who just have a slight interest in the Transformers franchise compared to others. This movie honestly made me excited for the Bumblebee sequel, and possibly Transformers 6. The last Transformers movie before this that I liked was Age of Extinction, and Bumblebee comes out ahead of that movie by miles.So yeah, TLDR: Go watch this movie.

1001,jasdeep096,Ridiculous!,4,18 January 2019,"I went to theatres to watch this movie after reading fellow imdb users' reviews, and I feel like I've been done wrong.
Most of the positive reviews are written about how heart touching and not so over-the-top action movie this is. That is okay, as far as the story makes sense.
The story is portrayed as too fairytale like, and seems like forcedly this movie is trying to fill in the minutes by showing unrelated cut scenes.
Many times during the movie it felt like where was the common sense while writing the script, with national level security decisions being thrown around here and there, humans running in between transformers' fight, and dialogue delivery like that of a toddler trying to explain his evil plans. Nothing feels right about this movie, and I feel that in a rush to give this (a seemingly independent story) a happy ending, they went all outs to make it as cheesy and cliche as possible, to the point where one
starts thinking what am I doing sitting in this theatre and wasting time on this nonsensical drama movie.

It could go both ways, Bee is in the correct vehicle mode for Sam to find in the Michael Bay version of Transformers or the producers could build and branch off this movie to create another entirely different run of Transformer movies.

I mean who wrote the dialogues and the screenplay, child how just can back after watching Buzz Lightyear?I can deal with Bumblebee being dumb coz of the memory failure but the dialogues for the girl are just weird, the dialogue seems so stupid that you'll actually get irritated what would forxe her say stupid dialogue like that. Like when she goes to take Beetle she straight up offers to work in the garage for an year, like is the character that dumb and zero-dimensional.Honestly it feels less like a Transformers franchise and more like the rip-off of porn parody of Transformers.",Bumblebee

The best parts of the movie are two fights on Cybertron. The actual look of Transformers as in original movie is astonishing. Such a shame that we didn't hear Starscream :) . Later, the movie becomes an emotional story between an 18 year old kid and a ""robot"" from outer space. This kid did a fantastic job as Hailee performed superb! In overall I must say that Travis Knight did a great job, havin a fact that Michael Bay totally ruined the storyline. For example, Transformers learnt the language through www (as Optimus said in first part) - yet Decepticons speak perfect English :-D. You couldn't see Megatron on Cybetron, cos he was allerady on Earth in Hoover Dam.

There are many scenes where the viewer is left confused wondering or hanging. Some scenes are simply repetitive and I feel not cut smoothly to be cohesive. Bumblebee dies/gets killed and gets resurrected approx 10 times which gets old after a while. John Cena should just stop playing any serious roles. He is funny until he tries to be serious or bring emotions on the screen. Just does not suit him. Hailee delivers a solid performance and definitley is the perfect fit for the role. The Soundtrack is just awesome with the best of the 80ies. Not a ""gotta watch it again"" movie.

1013,missalaska,A Transformers movie with heart,9,14 December 2018,"I'll start by saying I really enjoyed it and it met expectations, which were rather high, but that's about it. As a regular movie goer I imagine anything between a 6 or 8 out of 10 for most. As an avid Transformers fan I personally give it an 8 or 9.It is a movie that uses a formula you've all seen before at this point, I'm certain. There aren't any real surprises and you can't go in expecting anything ground-breaking. But that's good because the movie isn't aiming to throw out something brand new - just something familiar, but skilfully executed.By the end, I was kind of thirsting for more film. And they could have easily put more in and pushed up the runtime - but I'm really glad that's not the end result. You can see they're keeping the scope to Charlie and Bumblebee for this one, and that's desperately what this side of the franchise needed. That simple, heartfelt storytelling. Inflating the film with more scenes on Cybertron or more plot on the military side or including more Cybertronians on Earth would have spoiled the balance, even though I *do* crave more content. It's good they didn't try to cram it into Bumblebee.Overall its format works, it's a delight and I could easily watch this movie a number of times over without getting bored. It did justice for Transformers fans and it won't alienate people unfamiliar with the franchise. A lot of franchise films don't always manage checking off both of these points.",Bumblebee

1017,georgegibsonj,An immensely enjoyable Film,10,28 December 2018,"Upon watching bumblebee and seeing the reviews of others I see that everyone (myself included) seems to agree on two things, you could say we hold a hive mind (most bumblebees dont live in hives they live in nests). Firstly If Charlie our protagonist got in the car form bumblebee that she chased down on a moped then what the hell happened to the moped did she just leave it on the road and secondly most agree that Bumblebee is actually a pretty decent film something of a triumph for the live action Transformers movies.Micheal Bays first Transformers film had a love it or hate it vibe the ones following had more of a hate it or hate it vibe.
However this film was different it held a coherent plot, it seemed to have an understanding of the audiences emotional tapestry and most importantly it was an enjoyable film telling a story one could actually understand nae even care about with good performances especially from Hailee Steinfeld who has been pretty excellent in everything I have seen her in most recently 'Spider man into the spider verse' and most notably 'True grit' for which she was nominated for an Oscar. Also i personally love a hammy, cheesy John Cena stereotypical Army man role.Frankly there is lots I could say about this film as it has so many little moments that I either liked or was bugged by but I am going to stop here leaving on the comment that this was a solid film benefiting from a strong focused plot. Travis Knight should be proud of himself as he didn't just make a solid film he made a solid film out of the foundations of a poor franchise (the live action franchise not transformers in general). well done Travis, well done Hailee but mostly well done John Cena.",Bumblebee

1035,joecool-65083,Great but a few picky errors,8,22 January 2019,"It was a great film. Best transformers film yet but disappointed it's not a full reboot. The cast was great and John cena actually starred in a good film and acted well. Hailee Steinfeld was great and played moody teenager with a tragic backstory that no one understands really well and really got to the audience of a similar age(myself included). I really like her. What annoyed me though was that she's 22 in real life, her character was newly 19 but she looked 16. Jorge Lendeborg Jr was also a great addition. He played a very relatable character well and I felt he got his big break film, hope to see him go far in the future. I was a bit annoyed with the ending. After the battle to save the earth and they've been through hell, it was a nice sunset with Charlie and memo looking out into it. Memo reaches over to hold her hand and she just rejects him. She had already kissed him on the cheek and nearly died with him so it would've been good to see memo get what he finally wanted. A chance at being with Charlie emotionally. I felt the director wanted to have a non cliche ending but i felt it would've been better character development for the two. If this film isn't a full reboot what is it. It completely ignores the other films timelines and continuity so might aswell make it a reboot and introduce two new characters and somewhat follow them throughout the next couple films.
All in all it was a great film with a great and relatable cast with a ok plot and a few obvious scenes but that's just being picky.",Bumblebee

I've never expected to see a Transformers movie made by people who actually cared. Cared about what the fans of the original 80's cartoon want to see, cared about telling a good story combined with good acting and solid action, suspense and comedy. There's enough on the surface that the true fans will recognize, the Transformers in their original form, cybertron, even Stan Bush ""You got the touch"" is played in the movie. its an incredible piece of work and if this is the direction this franchise is going right now. It can't be ignored anymore. The Transformers are back and the movies can be enjoyed once again.",Bumblebee

1046,orangebeetles,This might BEE the best movie of the year!!,10,1 January 2019,"I watched the first live-action ""Transformers"" movie when I was six years old. Unfortunately, I wasn't one of the people that got to grow up on the cartoons, but violent child that I was, I enjoyed the long fight sequences and EXPLOSIONS. We even got the movie on DVD so I could watch it again and again. As I got older, and new Transformers movies came out, I began to pick apart the Transformers a little moreand discovered they were still... well, pretty explosive (or lacking in plot, so to speak).So, when I found out they were making a Bumble Bee movie, I internally groaned. Why did they continue to make Transformers movies? However, this initial impression was pretty unfounded. Bumble Bee was a great movie and actually reminded me why I liked Transformers! Not only that, I enjoyed seeing a female protagonist that wasn't overly sexualized and wasn't in some dramatic romance. I feel like Bumble Bee would've actually been a better movie for six-year old me than the other Transformers movies... Long story short, go see Bumble Bee and take a car-loving kid you know along as well!",Bumblebee

I mean they didn't listen to her, treated her like she was 3, and should have been turned to goo by the Decepticons.

1049,edmondsmicah,Thematically Overencumbered,4,18 January 2019,"There's a surprising revelation I've had concerning Transformers after seeing Bumblebee - namely that Michael Bay may not have been to blame for every inch of the series downward spiral into self-cannibalisation and it's appeal tantamount to potato mash. He's certainly at the helm of the films' atrotrious misogony, stretched run times, derivative plots, racially insensitive caricatures and overall lack of focus, elements of which Bumblebee is thankfully free. Without these glaring and consistent fundamental problems to blame, however, I'll have to focus in on the actual storytelling, and perhaps only now with all that junk out of the way can I really see the most core problem with the Transformers films: they simply doesn't understand what makes Tranformers interesting.One part a diet Iron Giant, one part Big Hero Six, what isn't familiar about Bumblebee from other human/ robot relationship films feels cobbled together from afternoon episodes of a teenage drama and the most wildly out of tone child-friendly military film one could possibly imagine. So little care was given to attempt to transition between the mood of each seperate thread. Each character feels as if they've been ripped from seperate plots, each scene introduces or reaffirms a meaningless emotional beat until the audience is drowning in good storytelling intentions swathed by a total lack of refinement. It makes curious mistakes that feel typical of a film trying to play it safe, but it doesn't feel like it's enjoying itself within those boundaries either. I fail to see how this film's premise is at all treading new territory for the series - it simply adds in things which were missing from previous titles whilst not dealing with the issues which arise in their place. There may be emotional content here but there still isn't a reason for the robot/ human interaction to be the focal point in place of a purely Transformers focused story taking place on Cybertron, for instance, which would allow a lot more room to play into what makes this series actually unique.The spectacle was barely engaging. It became boring to watch the Transformers transform. That should tell you all you need to know.Bumblebee felt like it was going in the right direction but didn't have a vision strong enough to cut the fat and focus in on something genuinley appealing and unique to what Transformers provides. As of now, I think the series has more central problems than the window dressing of distaste Bay has hung across it to deal with - most significant of all is actually discovering what it is about Transformers that makes them stories worth telling at all.",Bumblebee

She pretends to be ugly...but she wakes up with hollywood makeup on and drops applying new makeup on, she doesnt care about stinking sweat and she brushes teeth that some man do. And she likes to fix cars.
She is trying to act lika Shia in the original transformers movies.
And the neighbour (the megan fox character) is a boy that screams like a girl when seeing Bumblebee the first time. Come on! He have african heritage and there is some romancebetween him and the white girl. Come on political correctness!!! And his acting is very bad, he is very annohing and the things he do is stupid. He is a skinny boy and when he takes off his shirt the girl likes his body. OMG. He and his stupid character almost destroys the movie.COME ON! BOYS AND GIRLS ARE DIFFERENT, it has to do something with our brain chemistry! Thank god it didnt end up like the ghostbusters movie.

The director did a great job with themeing the whole movie, it was set in the 80s and everything around just felt like the 80s, the music, devices, outfits, everything!
Bumblebee is one of the best characters in the franchise and with this movie they just prove us he really is just as powerful as Optimus Prime.
It's good to see that this movie is mostly focused on the obots and not focused at all on the human side. That's just exactly what the transformers franchise is.The effects were also on point, it's great to see how the cinematography industry has advanced and it for sure looked real and not that much of a fantasy unlike in the other movies.In conclusion, it was awesome and you should absolutely watch it.",Bumblebee

This is far from one of them.Basically it's for young kids and those who like to feel very prepared for what comes next in a movie.

1079,sharkfinns,Didn't realize I would be watching a remake of The Iron Giant,2,8 January 2019,"Bumblebee is possibly one of the most predictable, formulaic movies I have ever seen. Every cliché you could possibly imagine was unironically showcased in this movie. A protagonist with a dead parent? Check. A mean girl posse? Check. A countdown to the imminent destruction of the entire world? Check.I guess it's lack of creativity wasn't enough because they had to make sure the storyline was bad as well. For some reason, they decided that it would be a good idea to make Bumblebee mute at the very beginning of the movie, so he couldn't talk the entire time (save a few ""lines"" played through his radio). This resulted in Bumblebee being portrayed as Hailee Steinfeld's gentle pet instead of the fiercer character that was portrayed in the other Transformers
movies. This film really could have been a remake of The Iron Giant. The similarities are uncanny.They really should have titled the film ""Charlie"" because it is more about her backstory than Bumblebee's. We receive a full character arc for her. We see her transform (haha) from an angry, troubled teen who isn't over her father's death and is too afraid to connect with people to a joyful, courageous girl who is able to connect with people again. We don't get anywhere near the amount of development for Bumblebee's character. The only new thing revealed about him is how he got his name, which happens in a 10 second clip. Poor Bumblebee played second fiddle in his own movie!Overall, the acting is good but the cliched storyline and the strayed focus of the movie ultimately caused its downfall. I guess Hailee Steinfeld and friends could save the world but couldn't save this film from being a disaster.",Bumblebee

Just how a nostalgic children's classic story should be told and brought to film. No over the top CGI effects or music score. No skimpy models or fancy cars were used to sell this film.
Unlike the Transformers trilogy, with Bumblebee you can follow and enjoy the storyline with great ease and actually see and make out what's happening during the fight scenes.
This did feel a bit like a movie made for TV or DVD but only because compared to many so called ""blockbuster productions"" made in the last two decades this movie wasn't full with product placement and product branding, or at least didn't seem like it.Just a great feel good movie for whole family to enjoy -together without having to explain what's happening to the kids.",Bumblebee

Well, having seen it... I am disappointed.
The first few minutes was really cool and I thought the rest of it was going to go the same way.
Let me start with the acting. It was generally poor (even from the female lead). I am a fan of John Cena and expected to see him steal scenes. But his acting proved to be mediocre.
A lot of time was spent focusing on the girl's life and it was boring actually. Bumblebee was annoying most of the time. It was the final act that he came through.
The action scenes were cool (especially on Cybertron) but the pacing was uneven. Don't want to spoil the movie but it is not as good as it's supposed to be.

Who says emotional slow cliche dialogue at time of life and death or when fight is going on and even if movies do pick such circumstances atleast it should be convincing. Whoever writes its screenplay is disappointing. This movie have lots of loopholes and does not connect at all. It has lots of vfx and hard work but the whole presentation is just upsetting.

1090,holroydc-98766,Very good.,9,14 March 2019,"Bumblebee Lead:Bumblebee is about the transformers, but really focused on Bumblebee, Bumblebee had to be sent to earth because the Autobots were being under attacked, he was shutdown and hidden for awhile, when Charlie, a girl from California, came across a Volkswagen Beetle that was in a junkyard, she really needed a car so this would help, she bribed the owner to let her have it, and he did. She took it home to work on it, and all the sudden the Volkswagen transformed into Bumblebee! She really gets to connect with Bumblebee, and you get to see Bumblebee's true emotions. But Charlie and Bumblebee have to deal with the military and the Decepticons chasing after them.Reason 1:I think you should watch this movie because it keeps you tuned in because there is a lot of action that you don't really wanna just stop, you wanna know what's next, you wanna know what will happen after that. It shows this through the fight scenes and things like that, like towards the end of the movie there's a fight scene with Bumblebee and the decepticons where he finally defeats them, and the whole time you're on the edge of your seat because it builds up to that moment and you don't want Bumblebee to lose the fight. There was also another scene in the beginning where Bumblebee lands on earth and the military are after him, so he runs through the woods as they are blasting at him with their machine guns from their jeeps, and he gets to the side of a mountain and one decepticon lands and comes after him and the military scatter, and Bumblebee tries to run up on the mountain to get away but then all the sudden the decepticon throws him off the mountain and he landed and got damaged real bad and the decepticon thought he got him for good. But Bumblebee crawled away and transformed into a new car and hid away for a long time, until Charlie found him.Reason 2:it's also different from other action movies because it's also very sad at times too, like it's not just straight action the whole time, it adds for it to be emotional at times as well. Because there are times where something happens to Bumblebee and you don't want him to die, because you've seen throughout the whole movie how he is, and you begin to like that character, so seeing something bad happen to him really hurts you and grabs towards your emotions.",Bumblebee

Honestly, if the franchise only thought of making Travis to be the director of the first series of the franchise, then maybe we could get the Transformers that we want, just like what he did here with this movie. It really goes ""Back To Life"" as the lead actress (Hailee Steinfeld) sang on one of the movie's soundtrack.Meanwhile, let's go to the plot...Well, I liked the idea that ""Bumblebee"" stays kind hearted despite being a robot, I love the idea that he grows to have ""human nature"" & the on-screen relationship of him and Charlie was really pleasing to see. Dylan O'Brien also carries out Bumblebee's voice perfectly, & even though John Cena (Agent Burns) is sometimes being funny overall the film delivers a Heartwarming kind movie that even the old folks can enjoy.

It's a fun popcorn movie, I didn't come here expecting Arrival or Close Encounters, and if you did that says more about you than the movie...Secondly, the movie doesn't take itself too seriously! This makes for just a fun enjoyable movie. No more Shia or Marky Mark overacting to push a story that just couldn't be saved.The soundtrack was a great touch, which gave it that nostalgic feel I get from watching the original animated movie.To those giving it a 1-2 out of 10... Get your head checked. 1 and 2s I reserve for Highlander 2 and Catwoman not this. A fun 6-7 out of 10 for the type of movie that it is.",Bumblebee

This is THE worst Transformers movie, if not nearly the worst I have ever seen.I actually laughed throughout the entire movie at all the screw-ups that appear.
Here are a few...1) How do the robots know what cars look like, if they haven't ever left their own planet?
2) why do they need wheels if their planet doesn't have any roads?
3) Why when the decepticon shoots a human being, they turn into a huge water bubble and then pop?
4) When bumblebee stands up in the garage, how does that 9 foot ceiling increase to accept bumblebees' height?
5) In one scene bumblebee instantly turns into a car without transforming first. What?
6) Give me a break, so when bumblebee gets zapped and hailey grabs bee's shoulder and they both go down to the ground...WTF...they reach for each other...really?Rewatch the movie, watch as a comedy and find all the stupid stuff, it will make you feel better.",Bumblebee

The plot is put together very well and I'm honestly glad it has a different director because there are far less explosions. What you get out of this movie is an innocent story of how bumblebee came to be. Not only did they call back to the original vw beetle style from the cartoon but they do so much with it that'll make you smile ear to ear. The action sequences are a lot better than previous films and you also see more hands on combat than just missiles and guns and other weapons. Along with that the main character struggles with her own personal matters and bumblebee helps her through them without even trying; which is the best part of the movie. There's not too much more I can say besides you have to watch it, it's definitely worth it.",Bumblebee

Seriously though, 90% of the movie is about humans, particularly this 18 yo, so why are we calling this transformers? I am currently watching this on Netflix and have forwarded through so much of the garbage about her life and how she Is depressed and confused and sad and blah blah blah. I wanted to watch a movie about robots. Not humans and their afflictions. It's like if the Avengers movies were all about regular human beings and what they have been through in their lives.... and 10% about superheroes. Who would want to watch that???? I love transformers, the 1986 animated movie is the best of the best and these live action movies will never come close. You wanna know why?

Basically this is a modern ultra-violent update on Herbie with teenage angst and high-tech robots who still resolve everything by hitting each other repeatedly. As kids movies go, not a great message. The premise of Transformers was always pretty basic, originally a badly-made animated kids' TV show to sell Japanese toys. This modern franchise just throws in millions of dollars for modern special effects while keeping the same basic tropes and dialogue to sell toys and other merchandise.

Here bumblbee was just being some innocent little man and it was annoying as hell plus there was hardly any action. TRANSFORMERS IS MEANT FOR ACTION NOT CUDDLY FRIENDSHIP For gods sake I'm glad Travis isn't making another one because this one sucked so badly! I don't know why everyone hates the explosions, it's litterally perfect, it's what makes up a good action scene but no instead we get werid fist fighting and it's just slow and stupid.

1126,Scott-o-bot,Best Bayformers film of the bunch... but still overhyped,5,22 December 2018,"To put it simply, Michael Bay's Transformers have gotten progressively worse. Most of the world is aware of it by this point. So regardless of the hype going into this one, it's best to watch it without having super high expectations. Since I haven't seen The Last Knight, nor do I plan to, my expectations for Bumblebee were quite low. Even though Travis Knight directed--and I'm a huge fan--it's important to remember that this is a prequel, not a reboot. So the connections with these other rapidly worsening films will still be there.So let's start with the beginning. The trailers hit as many G1 nostalgia buttons as they could to convince us that we were going to see a Transformers universe that wasn't so Bay-ed up. Thumbs up to the latest depiction of Cybertron, and also to the depiction of its inhabitants. The planetary visuals were jaw-dropping, even with a comparatively low budget. The Decepticon and Autobot visuals still leave something to be desired though. It's a classic case of ""be careful what you wish for"" because the G1 robots we've been begging to see for 10+ years looked like something from a video game rather than live action. They didn't look bad, just not great. Thumbs up to Peter Cullen (of course) and also Jon Bailey for a decent vocal recreation of two A-list Transformers, although the G1 voice actors would still have been preferable. Prime actually sounded honourable again! It was refreshing not to hear him sully the character with lines like, ""We'll kill them all"" or ""Give me your face"" or ""I'll kill you!!"" All the other voiceovers, sadly, sounded amateurish.Now the middle. Best way to sum it up would be to tell you to just watch the 2007 movie again, but with gender reversal. Back then it was the story of a boy and his first car... now it's the story of a girl and her first car. The parents are annoying as ever, the jokes are as boring as ever, and the plot holes are as big as ever. The relationship between Bee and Charlie is fleshed out much better than in '07. Hailee Steinfeld was large and in charge with every scene she was in, and unlike Shia LaBeouf she wasn't someone you wanted to strangle every 5 minutes. The fact that the movie took place in 1987 was rather meaningless because it never really felt like the '80s unless music was playing. Visually there weren't enough cues because it largely took place in the woods or near a military base. There were some clever references (such as listening to The Pretenders... get it?) but hearing Stan Bush's The Touch felt really shoehorned in and the actors had an overly exaggerated reaction to it, like the audience is supposed to gasp and get choked up by it. We didn't. Anybody who isn't familiar with G1 wouldn't care, and those of us who are familiar with it understand that the moment wasn't nearly Transformer-y enough to include it. The plot itself is razor-thin and includes the typical continuity errors that plague all the Bayformers films. It relies heavily on Steinfeld and Bee to carry the film on their shoulders. John Cena's shoulders are great for delivering FUs in the squared circle but not much else. He and the rest of the cast are forgettable. The pacing of the film is good.And finally, the end. The climactic fight sequence between Bee, the Decepticons, and the hopelessly ineffective Cena is at least enjoyable. Unlike Bay and his explosions, there was a lot more hand-to-hand combat here. It reminded me of the nicely choreographed forest fight sequence in Revenge Of The Fallen. It was easy to see what was happening, and this one was more drawn out. His fight with Dropkick was much longer than with Shatter but its climax was something of a head scratcher. The biggest drawback is the lack of a *big* villain though, and the G1 Transformers universe has plenty to go around. For a self-proclaimed Transformers fan I thought Knight would have been able to present someone, anyone, more significant. Instead we get two more newbies out of thin air. Kudos to Angela Bassett and Justin Theroux for playing their parts very well though. In the final moments, which I would call the ""bridge scene,"" I experienced the most pleasantly goosebumpy moment (the biggest fist-pumping G1 moment in the film) while simultaneously receiving the biggest gut punch of the movie: the cold yucky reminder that this IS connected to the Michael Bay universe. Can old and new exist side-by-side? We get a literal example of it and it felt...... weird. Not bad overall but I'd still prefer a hard reboot.",Bumblebee
1127,kentnathanielchandra,It was an amazing movie with great story,8,24 August 2021,In my opinion it has a more interesting story rather than the second trilogy starred by Mark Wahlberg. It was a good solo movie and a good story to start the new trilogy that will come out. It tells about the first time bumblebee arrive on earth in the year 1987 and how he adapt to the situation on earth. He has to transform into a Volkswagen beetle and fight the soldier that want to annihilate him with a help from a teenage girl. At the end of the story after he defeated the soldier he met Optimus Prime and turn into black and yellow 1997 Camaro.,Bumblebee

1136,matthewdoyle,Light on the Michael Bay....,8,16 December 2018,"... but heavy on the family-friendly laughs and themes, and with a similar gravitas as the 'originals'.As a child of the 80s I am glad that this reboots the robot's (and disguise's) appearance. So:
Set in 1987.Original VW beetle.Cool 80s theme tune to Transformers.Characters retaining theirs 80s toy-look.Elvis Costello shirt.WalkmansCameos of Prime, Arcee, Wheel jack, Cliff jumper, Soundwave, Ravage, Shockwave...80s computer visuals even on the robot's HUD.THE ORIGINAL TRANSFORMING SOUND! (Essential in my youth of enacting toy battles!) and less creepy matrix-esque TF sounds.Yankees don't like overseas car manufacturers as much... Which is why bumblebee still finds himself camero skin eventually, setting this film up as a prequel rather than a reboot.Still, there are some glaring irregularities and inconsistencies. Like how does bumblebee survive all that pummelling? What is he so much tougher on Cybertron? What's with the 'no voice' thing AGAIN? Why is there so much time to lapse before the original ('witwicky story) And God knows how he picks up and plays ANYTHING from the radio whenever he wants? It's not like they had Spotify in 1987. But a welcome return of Section 7, which makes me see this as a superior forerunner to the Michael Bay pentology! I think he really demonstrated he was still producing in a scene where the TF fight above the puny human running from them below... But just not as slow motion.Took my 8 year old boy and he loved it. A real laugh, and a fan boy's wink (if not a Bay-wet-dream).Goodbye Director Michael Bay. Hello a more feminine version of Transformers which has more charm, less cleavage, and more laughs.

Same young girl struggling to come to terms with her fathers passing (missing/dead/MIA etc.). Super predictable...I suppose being that I grew up loving Transformers, I'm highly critical.

(The Green Book is amazing). The script is terrible filled with obvious and cheesy lines and a comic relief that is anything but comic. The plot is extremely predictable and the writers and director didn't achieve to add any credible depth to the characters. Hailee Steinfeld does her best but everything else is poor.The action scenes are below par for what one can expect of a huge blockbuster these days and the plot is filled with super improbable scenarios, even for an action movie.I think I counted more than 20 people leaving the cinema during the movie, many of them after only 30 minutes. I have never left a movie mid-way before but this time it was really tempting, although I didn't, hoping for it to somehow win me back.

1147,Franciscorosell,Hopefully they will reboot the franchise with this movie as the first one and forget about previous disasters,10,21 December 2018,"First Transformers movie that is actually good.Almost 10 years ago, I wrote an unfavourable review after the first movie by Michael Bay. I had been a real fanatic of the Transformers in my childhood and I did not feel the movie treated the story nor the characters (nor the fans!) with respect. The sequels were worse every time, and they even blamed poor stories due to the Hollywood writers association going on strike (I'm not kidding, they really blamed it on that).
This movie (Thank God at last !!!!!) undoes the harm done by the previous movies. It brought me back some good memories from my childhood fantasies. For once, the robots actually look like the cartoons. This is a big thing. The robots from the previous movies were horrible, and did not look whatsoever to the original toys.Producers for the next movies, please remember: The Transformers is a robot's story where human beings play a very secondary role in the same. It is not a story about humans in which robots are involved. Please don't ever cast goofy characters such as Agent Simmons (played by otherwise good actor John Turturro). It really kills the story. PLEASE READ THE COMICS AND WATCH THE ORIGINAL TRANSFORMERS CARTOONS before considering making more movies of these. If you don't get it, let other people produce them.

1151,anthony-ab,My childhood is back.,10,26 December 2018,As a fan of the original cartoon series this does the franchise justice. A big improvement from the previous movies that butchered the series until it was on its last leg. Has a bit of a cheesy 80s feel to it and shares many similarities to the iron giant. Overall a great watch for any transformer's fan and is good for the whole family.,Bumblebee
1152,Ralph272,Questions?,10,19 December 2018,"Great movie over all but....🤔 what I don't get is that in the first movie Optimus and the rest was regular robots and they got their form when they landed, on Cyber Tron Optimus had the truck shape already before he landed on Earth. Also in the last movie they showed bumble bee in WW1 or WW2 when the man was telling a story about the past.",Bumblebee
1153,realroblaw,G1 Transformers is the best!,8,24 December 2018,"I have been a Transformers fan since the original generation 1 (G1) series and watched all of them over and over again as a kid from the 1980's. When the original Michael Bay Transformers was announced years ago I was excited that my childhood imagination was going to explode onto the big screen, but I was very disappointed that Michael Bay messed up a good opportunity by making the franchise stupid and it frustrated me to where I didn't want to see anymore Transformers movies that is until I seen the awesome Bumblebee trailer.
After seeing the movie Bumblebee I can say that it is a big improvement but still messed up some things that could have made it way better. For one, the Cybertron fight scene was great but I wish there was more of it. More back story. Also Bumblebee shouldn't have lost his voice. That was a missed opportunity to give him the personality of the G1 series. Also the Transformers should have been shown to come to Earth already as they should have had their base in the mountainside and be in hiding. They could have been discovered during the 1980's and that would have been better story telling of the G1 tradition. Charlie was a great character but it would have been good to have Spike too and to the tradition of tge G1 franchise. When the Transformers were on Cybertron they should have not talked ""Earth"" language and should have been subtitled up until they came to Earth. Also the Transformers huds shouldn't have had Earth numbers displayed and should have been Cybertron glyphs up until they came to Earth and learned the languages. Also it was terrible to kill off Cliffjumper like that. He should have made it to Earth and been in the adventures longer. The look of the Transformers in this movie was spot on and I really REALLY hope a sequel will fix issues and go with G1 tradition even more. I enjoyed this movie more than all the other Transformers movies combined. I really want to give it a 10 out of 10 but not sticking to the G1 story enough hurt this review. I do recommend a watch and please PLEASE more sequels!",Bumblebee
1154,alex-greig,Definitely NOT what I expected!,2,27 January 2019,"Transformers is an action movie so I usually give it a lot of leeway for plot and acting so long as it delivers what is expected. Did this deliver though? I don't think so...The last transformers movie referenced Bumblebee as being some hard ass warrior from WWII, but here we are in 1987 with him arriving on earth for the fist time and getting beaten up every two seconds.I would normally assume that the people producing this film actually watch the previous movies but this felt more like a stand alone as it didn't tie in with the other
movies. Where was your continuity person?When I saw that Bumblebee was going to be coming out I thought it was going to be an EPIC movie. How did you screw this up!!!! He was built up in ""The Last Knight"" as some kind of kick ass hero with a dark past which you failed to deliver on.I agree with some of the other comments that this will suit the younger viewers who don't know anything about transformers, but for those of us who grew up with it, this was disappointing.Young viewers rating 7/10

1160,andras-252-903827,2 hours and 20$ wasted from my life,2,21 December 2018,"It is a complete disgrace to sell something like this. Trailer covers almost all actions and meaningful items. Apart from first 5 mins, there is almost NOTHING to it. No meaningful storyline, very bad, trivial and goofy story telling. After 5 mins, You're totally pumped up, but it never lives up to any expectations: classic bots or visuals or storyline. It is just pure hoax. After 30 mins You start hoping that things will get better, they'll return to parts of that first 5 mins,
and so a bit of humour helps to pass time spent with long shots of meaningless nonsense and bad conversations. Bit it never picks up. It goes down, down, down. So simple, so stupid, so not the film most would hope for. I dunno if this was supposed to be a reboot or an addition or remake but it fails in any case. I went in with the expectation and sense that it would match Michael Bay's version of the 1st Transformers easily, just by looking at the trailer. Boy I was wrong. After the movie, being in my 30s, I thought it might appeal to teenagers and I'm not getting something. But it is so stereo-typed US teens who might ACTUALLY like it, that I think those youngsters don't even exist or must be completely brainwashed. I'm so much dissapointed, and if there's one thing I can recommend doing: spend that 20$ of the ticket and the popcorn on a charity or a school where young folks learn how to write a script and create a story. Bay and Spielberg bought the idea, so no news there. No effory had to be made
There. They must have bought a staff too to make this movie an investment with proper return on it. All their job would have been to have a good story/script and shoot this thing properly. Instead they've choosen the easy part and with that, they hammered a nail into cinema's coffin by giving their names to something as bad as this one. Listening to anybody walking out of this one: I have not heard a single voice praising or liking it. :-(",Bumblebee

1178,irdawson99,"Transformers, Untarnished!",8,26 December 2018,"It's been 11 years since Michael Bay's ""Transformers."" For a lot of people, the movie was a guilty pleasure. It was loud, action-packed and filled with a ridiculous amount of special effects. Then came a sequel... It was bad. The sequels kept rolling and continued to assault the senses.Admittedly, Transformers as a franchise was never meant to be some sort of complex thought piece. It has always been about big robots, and having an ensemble of these characters. As Bumblebee itself even addresses, robots that call themselves ""Decepticons"" can't quite be trustworthy nor is that a swell move on their part. That detail itself kind of highlights what Transformers is supposed to be, simple and fun. That's not saying it's not allowed to have heavy elements or emotional moments. 1986's ""The Transformers: The Movie,"" based on the animated series, demonstrated everybody's favorite characters being tragically blown to bits. Many would consider the movie emotional, especially at the time of release. Bumblebee touches on a couple of emotional moments too - something Michael Bay tried to do but was too busy making his movies so draining and overlong.Bumblebee touches up on a lot of 80s Transformers elements. It is, after all, set in the 80s. That, in my opinion, is part of what made the movie great. The opening scene is reminiscent of sequences from the original animated series, dialogue and all. The rest of the movie uses 80s cliches that some would say we're still cliches. I felt as if using these cliches were clever. The music, the humor, teen drama were all topical, and I loved it more than I should've.I digress. Hailee Steinfeld does a wonderful performance as trouble teen, Charlie and John Cena is hilarious as military man, Agent Burns. The chemistry between characters in this movie aren't dwelled on too much but works well and doesn't feel forced in anyway. Bumblebee is immediately and consistently likeable and the movie basks in its lightweight fun.Travis Knight was an excellent choice for a director. As an animator and director of ""Kubo and the Two Strings,"" it's clear that Knight knows how to make a movie feel alive and knows how to appeal to all ages. Not that the occasional crudeness of Bay's movies should be an indicator of quality, but it made it so that the target audience was just mostly for the testosterone and adrenaline-filled, instead of the more universal appeal that Transformers should go for. Give this movie a go. If you're afraid of watching it because of your PTBD (Post-Traumatic Bay Disorder), let go of your feels. Bay is nowhere in sight.",Bumblebee

However, I forced myself to like them, but deep down really didn't.Bumblebee came along and I took my two little boys to watch it. Well what can I say, my four year old kept screaming out ""look that's bumblebee"", the movie was full of charm, a great human story, the transformers actually resembled their cartoon counterparts and it made us all laugh throughout.I was so pleased coming out of the cinema; this was the Transformers movie I had waited 30 years for!",Bumblebee

Where's Megatron transforming into a giant machine pistol? Where's Starscream? Who are those two main villain Decepticons? They're definitely not G1. We do see original Optimus Prime in all his glory but only briefly and precious little of the other Autobots.Also, there are a number of scenes that are eye-rollingly bad. How does Bumblebee suddenly annihilate a much larger and stronger Decepticon with just a few chains? It just happens, no explanation, and it's ridiculous.

I have to say that this film takes us way closer to the original characters (even on their apparance) and relationships than the Original Bay saga.Hailey is amazing as Charley and completely relatable as well as all the main characters and this film has done a great job as a prequel and setting up Bumblebee's back story. Plus it comes along with a great OST of 80s classics, so what's there not to love?With the right amount of tearful moments and comedy moments, this is for sure a film that all, but mostly children from the 80s, should definitely watch and enjoy :)",Bumblebee
1220,sumon-88796,Best Transformer Movie,9,21 March 2019,"To those people who are saying this movie is predictable, are you out of your mind? Of course this movie is predictable. How Bumblebee came to earth to create base for Autobot resistance. If you see other transformer movies, of course you can guess how this movie is about. If you can't, maybe you don't understand movies.What I am saying, if you say this movie is predictable doesn't make this movie bad, worthy of 2 star. This movie is awesome. I enjoyed it a lot.",Bumblebee
1221,optimusprime76,"Horrible, Cliche",3,28 April 2019,"This movie is poorly written, plot development is abysmal, and the scenes are backed by poorly done movie props.This movie does not tell the story of bumblebee, it tells the story of Charlie, and is filled with every cliche in the book.The cgi looks like it was produced before the original transformers and looks like a cartoon the entire time they are on cybertron.I wish I could return the digital copy I bought, and micheal bay should be ashamed to have his name tied to this wannabe.",Bumblebee
1222,farhanthaib,Transformers Movie At Its Best!,8,24 December 2018,I certainly did not expect a good transformers movie since the Last Knight installment. but this film surprisingly exceeds my expectations about what transformers movie that should have been made in the first place. Steinfeld and Cena's acting were outstanding. Knight has sucessfully played the audience emotions with Charlie and Bumblebee's relationship. this is a must-watch list for people who already lost their hope in Transformers franchise,Bumblebee
1223,jesper-52268,really great movie!,9,26 December 2018,If you have watch all other then you have to see this one to :-),Bumblebee
1224,hottmx,Just another Michael Bay vehicle,1,28 January 2019,"Jumps from one Bay cliche into the other accompanied by pompous special fx to mask the lack of proper acting. Never seen so much emo crap in the history of the Transformers. Story must have been written by someone suffering from borderline syndrome.
Leave that to Michael Bay; He'll produce everything to hell and back and talent is not an option if you'd be willing to direct or act or whatever for him. Another brilliant thing is how they managed to pick the most annoying and awful songs ever made in the 80's while this was the last golden age of music.
A total train wreck!",Bumblebee
1225,bobbiday,Lived it,9,24 December 2018,Great job! Story ties well into transformer movies without sacrificing its own style. Good job leaving out the usual soap opera love story. This movie is innocent and made for younger audience to enjoy. Great job!!,Bumblebee
1226,thebrycegreen,Feel good movie for the adult kid at heart,9,3 February 2019,"Entertainment is what we watch movies for, and you won't see any lack of it here. The characters were great and were acted perfectly for what this movie is. It's fun, it's heartfelt, and it will have you saying ""hell yeah"". My only regret was that I didn't see Bumblebee in theaters.",Bumblebee
1227,gdhurdakis,What Transformers 1 should have been...,10,23 January 2019,"Bumblebee is a taste of what Transformers on the big screen should have been. This film is by far my favorite of the Transformers series. This film isn't riddled with mindless action and a convoluted story with a new revelation on how transformers changed human history. Bumblebee is filled with amazing character development, a grounded story, and a bunch of fun surprises along the way. Bumblebee is the first Transformer to have a real and meaningful personality and grow so drastically. The human protagonist Charlie is by far the best human character of the franchise.By the way, this film is perfect for date night😉Autobots roll out!",Bumblebee
1228,boirsenko,Unexpectedly good and humane,7,24 December 2018,"When I went to this film, I thought it was just another blockbuster that would be forgotten in a couple of minutes. In a sense, it is. But you feel that a soul has been invested in this film and that is cool.The acting is good.
Visually, the film also looks decent.
So if you do not know where to go, this is a good option.",Bumblebee

From the very beginning of it, I was automatically disappointed by the way it was already a major plot hole. The years don't add up to the other movies in the Transformers series. Bumblebee was supposed to already be on Earth during WWII. I did think it was a good movie after I ignored that large gapping plothole.",Bumblebee

1232,jmandawg77,A reboot of Disney's Little mermaid,1,17 December 2018,"Well this ended up being a reboot of Little mermaid with robots instead of mer-people, but with a much worse soundtrack.From losing her voice, being confused about human devices, falling in love with the person who saved her all the way up to how they kill Ursela, and then Aerial dives in the water to save bumblebee, oops I mean prince Eric from drowning.Well I guess we'll all be waiting a bit longer for a proper reboot (reboot means to start over from scratch, not a low budget prequel). For now I recommend popping in your Little mermaid VHS tape and watching that instead it's way better.",Bumblebee
1233,rayman-85988,The movie the fan base has been waiting for,10,6 January 2019,I finally didn't feel disappointed after watching a Transformers movie. Big part for sure was getting to see all Transformers in G1 form which was immensely gratifying. They gave bumblebee and others more heart and sense of humor. Definitely a movie worth seeing and looking forward to sequel.,Bumblebee
1234,cminkster,A Waste of Money.,1,23 April 2019,"Besides completely destroying the entire Bayverse timeline, the entire movie is practically a plot hole in and of itself. Full of forced and amateur dialogue one would expect a 12 year old to post on her Wattpad, this movie is obviously overhyped and a literal waste of my time and money.
I was so excited to see this film, and the trailers looked pretty good. Reviews looked good too.Then I actually watched it.I have never been more disappointed and irate regarding a film. This entire plot and story was horribly predictable, and literally just one cliche piled on top of the other.While Bumblebees cuteness helps lessen the sheer agony of suffering through this movie, and Steinfeld tries her best to do abhorrent writing justice- the sins are too great.RESULT:
-1/10
Worse than the 80's animated movie because at least that one had an actual plot.",Bumblebee

1240,harrisoncdhunt,Why the negative reviews.,7,15 April 2019,Bumblebee seemed to me to be a heartwarming film. The plot was not amazing but I felt myself smiling a lot throughout due to nostalgia.,Bumblebee
1241,tommasodarienzo,Now this is a bad movie,1,15 December 2018,"This is a movie about giant robots without action, it's goofy, cliché in every worst way and show in your face every moment that dude, that's the 80s.Charlie character is a boring good-at-all directly out of the rejected script of The edge of seventeen, because who wrote bumblebee has no imagination so had to write the character on a previous work of Hailee Steinfeld just without everything good and compelling about it, leaving the audience with an empty character worthy of a bad tumblr fan fiction, like probably the previous work of the writer.Bumblebee start as a runaway warrior in search of an hideout, but after the comically ridiculous landing in the face of John Cena character and a chase with the army he's engaged in a fight with a decepticon, Bumblebee manage to win this fight but loses his voice and his memory.John Cena character show nothing of interest and in the end is just a military dude.At this point the movie show us the first met between Charlie and Bee, it's a stupid moment with Charlie's no fear reaction at the discovery of a giant robot who can disguise himself as a car while the giant robot is afraid.
Following this we have a too goofy too shallow too pretentious too full of 80s songs 50 minutes of the movie to show us the bonding between the main characters but instead of a teenager-alien robot the movie show us more a teenager-dog one, reducing the once fierce warrior in a dumb shell of himself.
In the meantime two decepticons came to earth after receiving a distress signal from the first Bee activation, once on the planet they convince the military that Bee is a criminal and they need to use American satellites to find him, humans accept, yes, the movie is this dumb and worse part is being self-aware with John Cena saying ""How we can trust them, they even call themselves decepticons!"".
After this dragged part of the movie Bee goofy attitude let the decepticons and the military to find him, leading to a not so entertaining chase in which Bee is easily captured by the military and the decepticons who discover from a message stored in Bee that Optimus Prime is coming to the Earth, killing Bee afterwards and rolling out to call the other decepticons.
But Charlie is there to revive the autobot who after being attacked by the army decide to kill humans, yes, the movie is this dumb.
Another dull, goofy chase scene before the final showdown that is probably the best action of the movie, ironically reach his peak in the moments that mirror Bay direction style. Charlie and Bee prevent the call of the decepticons with the help of Cena who understand the good nature of Bee and let them go before the rest of the army come.
In the end Bee and Charlie must separate with Bee changing his form in the famous Camaro of the original movie rolling out with ""Don't You Forget About Me"" playing in what is a good ending for a bad movie, if the movie ended here, but instead of closing the show with this high someone feel that we had to assist to Charlie homecoming.",Bumblebee

It has action, heart and emotions. The relationship between Charlie and Bumblebee is so emotional. I love it. And the bad guys..ohhhh.

1245,rburnley-39319,A transformers film worth writing about.,10,27 December 2018,"I've been using IMDB for years and never had the urge to submit a review until I saw this movie. Good story, good acting, and a much deeper exploration of the human/robot friendship than in the past. And, most importantly, being a life-long transformers fan since they were introduced in the 80's it was epic to see some of the heavy hitters in their ""proper"" designs at the beginning of the film.I sincerely hope the studio and Hasbro continue the universe using this movie as the springboard... maybe they can undo some of the fallout from the Michael Bay era.",Bumblebee

Oh hi Travis. What can I do for you?
Christina, you have 48 hours to come up with a script for Bumblebee. Don't worry about the dialogues. Only half wits will watch it and young children. We'll fill it with so much CGI so no one will notice what they are saying.""And that my friends, is Bumblebee. Predictable throughout. Full of cliché. Storyline was nothing new, just like trying a pasta plate that you have warmed up in the microwave, over and over and over again.On the plus side, hats off for the people that worked on the CGI. Incredible effects, good battle sequences, will keep you wanting more. Everything a Transformers fan is longing for. Music wise, loved every song that was used. If you are an 80s fan, you'll enjoy this film, from a music perspective.Unfortunately, we are in an era that originality is a thing from the past. There are, of course the odd films that will provide the exception to the rule but they are very scarce. Acting was a bit stiff for my liking but if you are a Sandra Bullock fan, you will probably like it.
I, prefer a little bit more on facial expressions, use of body language and emotional responses that come natural. Its just, that it wasn't there, on this picture.",Bumblebee

Guys, I heartly recommend you see it, and show it to your kids too. It may not be super original, it might be a little corny at times, but it's everything a good summer movie should be in my opinion. Besides Bumblebee the autobot the main character is a young lady named Charlie. She's everything you wanted Ray to be in Star Wars. Best of all, there's no woke BS, no preaching.

I was searching for things to enjoy and there are some good chuckles, but that's about it.First and foremost was an astounding lack of action. And the action there was seemed phoned in. I'm all for a character driven story; after all, you care about characters instead of archetypes. But the characters were just so standard there was nothing to set them apart or make me care. So many scenes I was thinking ""what's the point?"" and that's just bad storytelling.I'm a very passive enjoyed of Transformers and while I do think the director cared about the franchise, it just failed in execution. There's a sweet spot between this and Bay's movies (which I greatly dislike but admit there is at least some enjoyment factor in some places) and if someone finds that, they'll really make something great.",Bumblebee

My instant reaction was ""Oh well..."", I think that they stretched this franchise beyond all reason. The movie was okay though, it kind of brought me back to the feelings that the first one gave me - and that's cool. I think that it's worth seeing since it covers the time right before the first one.

1260,canterman-81357,Dissaponting given the reviews,2,28 April 2019,"This movie was below average, cliche, and downright stupid at points. The way the plot advances is through the biggest cliches and convinces that border on unimaginable even in a fantasy world where advance extraterrestrial robots can trun into cars.
I expected an average movie by the rave reviews praising this movie but upon actually viewing it I was shocked by how stupid the movie was. So many things don't make sense with the story, the acting was meh at best. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is because it caused me to eye roll a little less than Michael Bays saga (the 1st transformers excluded)",Bumblebee

There are some plotholes, the acting certainly wasn't bad but won't win any Oscars either, and there were a number of cliché scenes to build tension or provide comic relief that didn't work for me because... cliché.
It wasn't all bad though. On the contrary, it had some good jokes in there, some heartfelt moments and a lot of entertainment value. Which brings me to the best part of this movie, the transformers. All the small flaws are easely forgiven for the sheer joy of finally getting the G1 transformers we all love and hoped for since the first transformer movie was announced. For me, this movie was a great nostalgic nerdgasm that might (unfortunately) be lost to viewers under the age of 40-ish. I was simply fanboying through most of this movie. It left a big grin on my face and isn't that the whole point of a movie like this?",Bumblebee

Becuase this was the worst movie i have ever watched in my life. So bad acting. I could watch this in my head beacuse i knew what was gona happen. They showed us her waking up/being in her bed 4 times. The breakfast club related things atleast 7 times. This is a fast put together movie that failed horribly. A example that the movie industrie is running ou of ideas. Specially with the trend that women is getting the lead role. It is so obvious for example: the lead is a girl, the reneck couple only the guy get killed, in the head quarters of ""america"" there is a agent and two women secretarys. I have no problem with girls getting the lead and sutch but when you make it obvious that you make it just to be pk and be loved by femenist they can piss off.

It's aimed for all ages and its very well put together. Don't wait for the Blu-ray, this movie is meant to be seen in the Big Screen!Now if you are looking for Michael Bay Transformer's 6, this ain't it!

It has a nostalgic feel to it, a good story and lots of G1 refferences starting with G1sh look on the robots, Optimus Prime's jump scene on Cybertron looks exactly like the one on the 1986 movie, Soundwave's voice and let's not forget ""the touch"" that Bee plays when Charlie hesitates to jump from the cliff.
Apart from that even the fight scenes were good. You could follow the action without getting a headache for once from all those firework explosions.

1286,westwoodjaxon,Surprisingly Great Movie,7,3 January 2019,"When I first heard they were making a Bumblebee spinoff movie I originally thought ""there's another movie I'm not going to see"". I'm not a fan of the previous Transformers movies so I initially brushed this off. I later heard Hailee Stainfeld is in this and I've been a fan of her work and John Cena playing the villain was a plus. Well, reviews came in and it received pretty high praise so I decided to check it out afterall. I was pleasantly surprised, it was a lot of fun. It's not an amazing movie but it it's all you would want a movie like this to be. It relies pretty heavily on nostalgia, constantly making 80's references, because this is a prequel Transformers movie. It's humor doesn't always work, but there it is certainly a fun movie overall. The fights scenes are clear and mostly limit two Transformers at a time and each Transformer has it's own design and are pretty colorful so it's a nice change from the Bay films. Overall this is a simple and fun blockbuster movie with quite a lot to enjoy.",Bumblebee

The performances by the actors were great though.Bumblebee could just as much been replaced by a cute puppy, or maybe jus Lassie..All the great reviews are obviously people who never really watched the cartoons or have forgotten what transformers is really about.

But since I had seen them and since I knew that Bumblebee was on earth the early 1900s, this movie made no sense claiming that Bumblebee's first trip to Earth was in the 1970s.Not to mention that the fifth movie also showed that beings from Cybertron were on Earth clear back to the time of King Arthur and Merlin, that they fought to defend the people of the time, and that there are a lot of clues and messages left here from that time and forward.This movie for me was like watching one of the old lovebug movies with the Decepticons thrown in as a weird plot twist.Having seen the fifth movie, however, I
already knew that Bumblebee was an incredibly powerful and dangerous soldier called ZB7, fighting side by side with the people of Earth in wars in the early 1900s forward.Consequently, this movie made no sense to me and should not be represented as Bumblebee's first trip to Earth.",Bumblebee

I wish the whole movie were like the first 5 minutes. That would have been a good flick. Instead they put a wig on Shia LeBouf and changed one John out for another. I can't help but laugh at every line Cena says. Bumblebee gets beat up most of the movie. There's barely enough Transformers to constitute a plurality. Not much of an action movie and not enough romance to entertain the tween market that this is probably more suited for. It's the perfect movie to bore pretty much the entire family.,Bumblebee

The sunroof magically appears foe one scene and then disappears?Why does Bumblebee still have beetle parts when he is in Transformed mode?If the father is not working and the family is (apparently) broke, why do they have a valuable old corvette in the garage?At the end, why did army guy not tell everyone that Bumblebee was a good guy?I could go on and on.I thought the picture was okay to take the kids too, but all the 9 & 10 ratings are not deserved.",Bumblebee

I loved it.The acting was ddcent from the heroine and the bad decepticons kept the threat real.I hope they make a sequel to this and build on what they did well.It was so amazing to see transformers fighting like my childhood.This is the 2nd best transformers movie behind 1986 animated feature.,Bumblebee

Characters played are Artist are fantastic , sarcasm of John Cena is appreciable and love story of a boy and girl ,this movie has taken deep touch with humane nature of Bumblebee as depicts the loving side of B-127 (Bumblebee) and the cute moment is movie give a great laugh in home and action scenes are quite well

1310,karstenhempfling,Way overhyped,1,5 January 2019,"Went in quite excited since I liked all the previous transformer movies, but honestly, this is the worst yet.
First of all its pretty much the first transformer movie re-skinned, add on top of that tons of cheesy attempts at humour and terribly cringy characters, and you got yourself this mess.
The main character seems to be in a constant brooding mode, her boyfriend is annoying beyond measure, and John Cena is flatter than a cardboard cutout.
Honestly, I would have walked out of it didn't seem like my younger brother enjoyed it. The CGI seemed worse than it was in 2007, the story was boring and lead nowhere, adding all this together I was just happy when it was finally over.Overall, in my opinion, the worst transformer movie yet, which is very sad since I actually really liked the franchise.

1324,adamsroman,Strictly an opinion,5,22 December 2018,"I am not paid to write these so everything here is strictly opinion. Please remember that as you read on.
I was extremely excited in the opening credits. The opening scene had a retro vibe that had me pumped to see the rest of this movie. Unfortunately from the trailer, we know that the movie doesn't stay in this setting. The movie as a whole gave me a feeling that it never quite took off.
Leaving the theater,I felt like this was more of a coming-of-age movie than it was an action film. Yes, it was warming and heart-felt, but a little over the top. I turned to a friend and whispered ""annnddd we are crying again."" It didn't match the tone of the movie.
Some viewers or readers may say there is more to a movie than action and that Michael Bay sucks and this was the best movie ever (I read some user reviews), but it just didn't feel like a Transformers movie. It felt like an ""alien"" movie(not the franchise).
The one thing that I can give this movie is that they must be doing a revamp of the series, because it does not fall in the timeline of the other movies.
Being set in the 80s with Bee arriving the first time, a viewer already understands it isnt the same storyline. In the Bay films, Bee came to Earth in the 40s to change the tides of War.
All in all, I'm having to stick by my 5/10. Probably would tell others to wait until Redbox/rental.",Bumblebee
1325,agawnursing,Great Start!,9,22 December 2018,"I thoroughly enjoyed the movie and really hope it is the first of a set of new Transformers films.The main features I enjoyed:1) The explosions happened when things that normally would explode, exploded.2) No convoluted plot or MacGuffin determining the motives of the protagonists.3) No gratuitous shots or toilet humor.4) Meaningful conversations between the bots! Not just forced humor, one-liners, or quips.5) Good looking CGI.6) Fights where the camera isn't zoomed in to where everything is a blur.7) Good throw-backs to the Bay films and G1.8) Cybertron!9) Cybertronian alt-modes!10) Teen(s) fighting ALONGSIDE a Transformer rather than a Transformer just being in the background of the action.11) Decepticons that are distinguishable from each other.12) Some seriously horrific and PTSD moments when you really think about it, which is nice for the adult viewer.13) Great fights between the two factions. Bumblebee is a badass soldier.14) Transformers doing a lot of transforming!15) Conversations that normal people would normally have.16) Bumblebee is the focus of his own movie.There were only three scenes of the movie I felt could be changed or left out altogether but these were minor and didn't change my overall impression.Overall, I can't wait until I can see it again <3",Bumblebee
1326,loki-44881,Worst movie for a long time.,1,22 December 2018,"I never wrote a review or cared about any movie.This movie is very bad. I expected some kind of adventure.

The movie overall was heartwarming, action packed-ish, and comedic. But my main question is, how does this movie fit into the Transformers Movie Universe? Towards the end of the movie we see Optimus with Bumblebee in the woods and then there's a meteor shower; and I'm assuming that's the first wave of the AutoBots coming to Earth, leading into the first Transformers movie. But if you've seen the first TFs movie its kinda confusing with the Bumblebee movie in the timelime. I'm pretty sure with Michael Bay producing the movie he probably had some insight on what was going on on set.

What's up with all that charlie drama for ?
it went for so long for nothing at all. i got dejavu from starwars tlj situation about finn subplot. it didnt build bumblebee's story and is a very unnecessary subplot. i was thinking this all will be worth it only if Charlie died, so at least it will add so much weight to bumblebee's character, but nope, she survived, live happy ending with family and new bf, and separated from bumblebee. why bother then ? who cares about her friendship or family or love. its not even that deep. i felt like i was watching regular tv show level story telling for 60% of the movie.+

Plot: it is very predictable and doesn't bring anything new. You may notice some plot holes. Also it messes with timeline of previous films.
Characters: nothing interesting about them, they are just flat: good guys, bad guys. Bumblebee acts as infant child 80% of the movie. He is also always protected by a plot armor, no matter how much damage does he take, he is still alive.
Movie is oversaturated with oneliners. There were only couple decent jokes, all others fell flat all the time.
Action scenes are just mediocre. Previous transformers had better ones.

Definitely a step in the right direction. Little disappointed at the end he became a camero again but the ending credits he looked liked the Vw Beetle.

1338,Taopedo,"Overrated Movie, This is a 6 stars movie",1,27 December 2018,"I went to watch the movie with high expectation, but it is just bad. The first three minutes were exciting and I was thinking it was going to be great. However, it didn't. It was just gradually deteriorating and finally fell into an abyss. The whole story is like the knockoff version of E.T. mixed with The Iron Giant. I didn't see the connection between the tragedy of her father and her needing a car (just because her father left her a car? This is a plot wrote by a kid). Most of the jokes didn't speak to me. I was hoping the return of Prime, because I didn't believe this was rated 97% good by Rotten Tomatoes.
After watching this movie, I watched 10 reviews from YouTube. Most of them are saying it's awesome. I was so confused.
There are 2 main reasons they think it is good:
1. They are G1 Transformer fans
2. They hate Michael Bay
These reasons are so bias! Movies are not just for fans, otherwise that World of Warcraft movie is what you are gonna end up with.

After 20 mins of painfully hoping Michael Bay would come back in to take control (which he clearly doesnt), the movie deteriorated into awful one liners tediously delivered by really weak actors.Having read some of the reviews i can only assume i was in a different movie. There is no way i watched the same film as a 10/10 reviewer. Just doesnt make sense how anyone would rate such an awful film above a 1star or 2 stars if you were being exceedingly generous.The cinema was empty to start with, which then further decreased as the movie progressed delivering awkward lines and scenes by the truck load.CGI was good but all completely undone by weak scripts and poor performances at every opportunity.Such a shame the original two movies have been actively weakened by the subsequent movies.Save yourself the money, (and more importantly your life (doing absolutely anything else)) as this movie will be found soon in the .99p section of your local tesco.No more transformer francises for me.",Bumblebee

1341,christopherabird,"Cliche, poor scripted, horrible dialogue and acting",2,29 December 2018,I was so excited to see this film - especially based on the reviews. I think I must have seen an entirely different movie than the others. The lines delivered were forced. The plot was incredibly predictable - really lazy writing with weak story line. The acting was terrible - even John Cena's acting was terrible. The music was childish and forced as well. The visual effects were strong as you might expect. I think that the writers wanted the audience to care for bumblebee at the beginning of the movie but didn't establish the relationship well. Character development was weak.,Bumblebee
1342,unlistedjames,Good movie. Best Trasformers movie.,9,30 December 2018,"Bumblebee didn't disappoint. All my kids loved it and said it was their favorite Transformers movie. It was the best Transformers, as far as staying true to the the original cartoons and comics, which made each transformer more colorful and recognizable (as opposed to Michael Bay's dark and indistinguishable robots).
As he should have been all along, Bumblebee was smaller and far weaker than in the previous movies, which makes for a more compelling and relatable hero who is courageous even when overpowered and outnumbered. My daughter said, ""He's so small."" I told her that's what makes him heroic: it's easy to be brave when you're big and strong, but it takes courage to fight when you're likely to lose.
There were also comparable elements to E.T.: an alien lands in 1980's California, gets found by a child who cares for it, who explores the house with humorous results when left alone, and is hunted by government forces, yet they didn't copy the plot. And they set the 80's scene well. Details that were likely lost on every young viewer looked familiar and nostalgic to me. They put effort into the historical setting so the only complaint I have with the movie's timeline was the use of Humvees, which weren't really used until the First Gulf War in 1991. A minor detail, but they just looked out of place, often, when army jeeps (which had an appearance early in the movie) would have been more appropriate.
Aside from being a Transformers movie, it was solid as a story of its own, like Iron Giant: a friendly fighting machine. The few main characters have enough depth that you even want the human antagonists to make it through. You can care about the protagonists, and they aren't shallow trope followers. For example, the boy and girl don't fall in love just because they've gone through the excitement of the story.
It's much smaller with less spectacle than the world-blasting beasts of the previous series, but there's much more to enjoy when you can focus without being blown away.",Bumblebee

We barely see some action from Bumblebee, he is mostly being all cuddly and acting like a puppy. Instead of focusing on the origins of the Transformers and Orion Pax, we are hear watching the girl being bullied for not taking the dive... then conveniently having to take the dive in the end of the movie to... I don't know how she helps bumblebee underwater.That scene on the road where she aske her friend to take off his shirt to just wrap it around her head and scream out of the car...when she is clearly wearing a shirt over a t-shirt... stupid..That Salute sign from Cena at the end..I felt like i was watching a combination of Mighty Joe Young and Herbie Reloaded. Horrible..",Bumblebee
1345,pazziamass,The first good live action transformer movie.,10,31 December 2018,"This movie was amazing, if you enjoyed the transformer cartoons from the 80s you'll definitely love this. It feels and looks exactly like the cartoon. For example the opening scene on cybertron was perfect, it was amazing to see all the transformers and being able to recognize them for once. The only problem I had with this movie was that it didn't want to completely lean into the reboot and kind of tried to fit into the Micheal bay continuity. Oh and Hailee Steinfield was also amazing.",Bumblebee
1346,zackjoetomwalker,Sound movie bruh🔥😍😂,10,2 January 2019,You haven't seen a transformers movie like it🔥🔥🔥. It's like jigsaw with no missing peaces🎉. It is based in 1987 I think and it has music that was apparently THE HIT back then that I never heard of🤙👌. Overall great movie with no regrets for buying that 7.50euro medium combo🤑🤢.,Bumblebee
1347,lilpj-02323,Best Transformers Movie BY FAR,10,1 January 2019,"When I was about to go see this movie, I thought that it was going to be some Michael Bay prequel, involving sex, drugs, explosion therapy and a bunch of other stuff. Boy was I wrong. This movie is the best movie I have seen in a LONG time. This reboot is SOOOO what the Transformers name needed. Its a incredible reboot. Keep it up Knight! Keep releasing masterpieces like these and you will have refurnished the Transformers name back to its former glory, for all ages and generations to enjoy!",Bumblebee
1348,andrei-13523,It couldnt be worse!,1,3 January 2019,Spend your ticket money elsewhere or just burn it!,Bumblebee
1349,drazenhvar,Bumblebee,10,3 January 2019,"Main idea was to suprise my 4 year old son with the mouvie because he likes Beetle cars very much and especially when it's transform into robot so he was enjoying very, very much but i enjoydid too. Good story, nice effects and music brings you back to 80's. On big screen is excellent. Sorry for my english writing but i hope you get the message and i recomend the film. 113 minutes of action and fun.",Bumblebee
1350,aktimers,It finally happened.,9,28 March 2019,"Note: I am not a very good movie critic. I just like movies in general and thought I give it a try on reviewing them.Since 2007 I was waiting for a good Transformers movie. The first one blew me away. And it finally happened. There are no useless scenes in this, every character has a good development throughout the movie and boy...the fights! Michael Bay did fight scenes in general with fast cuts, explosions and guns. But the fight scenes in this movie...they feel real. You can feel every punch, every throw. Everytime someone does something, it's thought through. I would like to give one more movie like this a try. Enjoyed, the characters, there was no dumb humor and I can identify with everybody in this. Solid 9/10. Very good Transformers movie.",Bumblebee
1351,shumaurasaki,Best Transformers movie ever!,10,5 January 2019,"This movie was just mindblowing and astonishing. For the first 10 minutes of the movie, it just shot me with a pack of nostalgia. The war on cybertron was probably the best 10 minutes in the entire film. After that you will get excited to see the rest of the film. I really recommend watching this film if you're a diehard transformers fan or if you just like action movies with robots in them. 10/10!!!",Bumblebee
1352,blacksolidcloud,Just a decent overrated movie,7,5 January 2019,The decepticon are the only one who'll remind us that this is a transformer movies. Not some kind of twilight movie. Ughh,Bumblebee
1353,bustermalik,Worse than I expected...,5,5 January 2019,"I really don't understand why people rate this 10/10, I expected to see more transformers since there only was 4 in total. The only good and best part was when they were in cybertron, which gave me nostalgia back then where I used to see the original transformers cartoon that I loved. Overall bad movie.",Bumblebee
1354,kapilningthouja,Bumble is bae,8,6 January 2019,Bumblebee. A cute movie with lots of emotions between a human and its first robot(transformer) unlike other transformer movies. It is infused with some well staged action scenes (with some loopholes unanswered). Hailee steinfield doesn't let us down with her convincing mechanical nerd rebellious teenager role (awwe she's extremely talented and beautiful). This movie shows a glimpse of the late 80s which also shows that most of your parents lived in a much cooler period then we ever will live.😊,Bumblebee
1355,timtch,Amazingly present the classic Origin of Transformer!,10,7 January 2019,"To be honest, i really love this movie. I watched the first trailer since 7 month ago, i did not catchup with the trailer 3. I used to watch transformer cartoons when i was a kid 6/7 y/o perhaps, now i'm 30 y/o. Well, finally, this area the version of transformer i was imagine it in CGI. Michael Bay did a great modified version but still i like this old skool transformer, i also like the old skool soundwave ""video tape"" dude with funny voice. lol. Great job! can't wait for new production of the continue stories. Beside that, my parent do enjoy the sentimental life moment lesson from the movies as well, not just fight, killing, explosive scene. Bravo Team! ^^",Bumblebee
1356,mccauleysandry,Simply amazing!,10,8 January 2019,"Have to start by saying that this is the kind of feel that the new mark walhberg movies have missed. Loved the setting and the plot (however very close to how Sam and bumblebee meet). This was just great from the very start to the very end. There needs to be a follow up film to the up loose ends from the original film which I would thoroughly look forward to.I have no idea how ""true"" fans say they hated this and wanted to walk out, they must have been watching another film!",Bumblebee
1357,kenkanaki,A nice watch,8,25 January 2019,"After the greatest disaster (The last Knight) i told to my self nope! I am done with this franchise but after watching this piece of art i felt like yes this is a nice and sweet start don't care about the fighting and looks this is a new start for a new transformers franchise and i hope a better one.So point is don't care about what others say give it a try it's
Worth watching",Bumblebee
1358,PukkPix,Disappointing,3,13 January 2019,"Been looking forward to watching this movie so much that i am schocked how disappointigly bad it was - it felt like watching teens show.. i wanted to leave cinema during the movie at least 3 times but was still hoping it will get better.... boy, i was wrong.Unrealistic acting, storyline didnt flow, and.. John Cena?? It just felt like it was made a parody of transformers...
-Girl's birthday day, wanting a car, not having enough money for it and vuala - yellow scrap car just appears out of nowhere just to be a ""pet"" for a human kiddo.... Cmon!!
-Asking to borrow a guy's shirt, just so she could blindfold herself, while she is wearing shirt on a t-shirt...?
-Having 0 emotions about being put in the garbage bin (probably adrenaline blocked her smell senses?)
-Jumping into water from 'hell knows what was there' and diving like its a clear water from the sea (despite all the rubbish, debris and all other **** flowing there) to help a metal robot... how exactly?",Bumblebee
1359,sebinator-83544,The first good transformers movies,9,13 January 2019,"I was worried about it being a horrible movie but it blew me out of the water.it proved that bay was the problem with the live action movies.This movie is amazing and the soundtrack is awesome.The only problem I had was John Cena's acting, It could have been better.",Bumblebee
1360,ersuablak,One of the worst movies that I have ever watched,1,19 January 2019,I seriously think that the 10/!0 reviews are paid trolls of the production firm. There is no reason to give this movie more than 1 or 2 stars. Very predictable & very boring.,Bumblebee
1361,jcand-05886,Short and Simple,4,15 January 2019,"If you enjoyed the first three transformers that had a balance of awesome action and story between the autobots and Sam....then you won't enjoy this one. Extinction and last knight were bad, but at least those had action whereas bumblebee lacks that almost the entire movie",Bumblebee
1362,jonathancoles-67210,A bitter disappointment,2,13 February 2019,"So I genuinely don't know why this movie is so popular, and was so well received. They had a chance with this movie to correct the mistakes made by its predecessors and make a movie more in line with the original series. Instead, they compounded those mistakes. Despite being the title character, Bumblebee isn't the actual star of the film. He's basically relegated to a side character with little to add to the overall plot for most of the film, save of course for the beginning and end. All of the '80's nostalgia in the world couldn't make up for the simple fact that you'd still have more screen time if you cut out the scenes with Bumblebee in them, than if you cut Steinfeld's character. That shouldn't happen given the film's title.",Bumblebee
1363,dcapps-38248,bummblebee sucks,1,19 January 2019,I have only fell asleep 2 times in my 50 years of watching movies. This was my 3rd. This movie sucks,Bumblebee
1364,wastibby,Amazing except for inconsistency,9,19 January 2019,Amazing movie. the human involvement is 10x better than the bay movies outstanding transformer characters with classic cameos to put a smile on my face. I would give this a 10/10 if it was called a reboot from the beginning rather than prequel,Bumblebee
1365,vataip,2k19 We are back in time?,6,20 January 2019,"Since we are living in 2019 I want to see action, jokes etc. Drama. I believe it's just a past we left behind and for the people who actually like it, but this is suppose to be action movie so please make some action... What's the point go to the cinema for this movie?
I liked how it started, but after 10 mins i got bored till the end, like nothing actually happen. Can't say it's bad movie but, but still disappointed.",Bumblebee
1366,johannajobb,Worst. Transformermovie. Lever.,1,20 January 2019,"The timeline of this movie is all off. According to this movie, bumblebee crashes in about the 1980's. But that doesnt work because of the fact that bumblebee was fighting the nazis in the 1930's.
And that is just the top of the iceberg...",Bumblebee
1367,arqazi,Best Transformers Movie Yet,8,21 January 2019,"This movie was a real masterpiece. I watched it a few days ago with my family and thought it was fantastic. From a transformers fan aspect, i thought they could have added a well known Decepticon. Also another random thing they did was kill off Cliffjumper which I find weird as he's pretty big in the TF universe. But in terms of the story, acting and action, it was an outstanding movie. Would definitely watch again in theaters.",Bumblebee
1368,samayd-15762,Worst,1,20 February 2019,"Yet another Waste film after Transformers: Age of Extinction. There's no flame on Action Sequence , No Crispy Dialogues. On the Hands of Acting, No can do worst than this movie.",Bumblebee
1369,nhtk-88397,Naufal Halim,9,30 January 2019,"Finally they made an actually great transformers film,Michael bay didnt get the transformers franchise at all in fact he kept ruining it every time he did another movie,after the third one i lost all hope for a good transformers film and i stop watching them(i didn't even care about trailers or anything related)but when i heard bay was out and Travis Knight was in i started to get hope so i gave this a chance to see if they could improve without bay and not only i wasn't disappointed but i got in love with this franchise again,they understand the concept of a good transformers movie(no over the top action,no oversexualized teen girls,no explosions all over the place)just a good film with a simple plot and heart.",Bumblebee
1370,sebascalameros,Bumblebee is a pleasant surprise.,8,30 January 2019,The film is grounded and greatly benefits form a more character driven approach versus the spectacle CGI from the previous films. There's so much heart and passion in this film and it actually takes the time to develop the characters.,Bumblebee
1371,dwgould-18131,Bringing back the fans,10,4 February 2019,I have to say that the CGI in this film and the storyline were amazing. It was a little closer to the real story from the 80's.I would love to see the franchaise remake the original transformers movie in CGI like you saw them in Bumblebee. They could even go so far to remake the original series. I know that as a die hard Transformers fan that would be simply amazing.Thank you for the awesome movie Bumblebee and look forward to more awesome movies.,Bumblebee
1372,alexandda,About the movie,9,11 February 2019,"From the beginning of the movie we see that Bumblebee arrived on Earth in 1987, but don't make a sens because in the last movie i think, i'm not sure of the we see Bumblebee fighting im World War 2, the movie is like 50 years later and that is not ok.
I liked the movie, but tell the true story of Bumblebee, because Bumblebee is my favorite from all.",Bumblebee
1373,djensenjr,This movie is a bag of unfunny cliches.,1,7 April 2019,"Nothing works about this movie.
The plot was written by a 5 year old eating crayons between pop tarts and wishing he had a dad. Then they changed the boy into a boyish girl.
John Cena does his best to save the movie with the closest thing to relatable acting.
CGI is so great they repeat the most expensive scenes.
This movie was written to be a 1:54 h version of those 15 minutes you hated in that series you were watching.Spit this movie out like a K7 tape from an angry car stereo. You will know what I mean.",Bumblebee
1374,dapfos-17285,"Without a shadow of a doubt, the best Transformers by a country mile in the franchise!",9,27 February 2019,"Travis Knight (Director) with Christina Hodson (Writer) have finally given us a true Transformers live action film that we the fans deserve! Forget all the others, even the first one! This movie should reboot the franchise after the absolute mess caused by Bay's complete and utter abominations!This movie has everything that the Bayformers does not, a simple but decent and effective plot, no over the top action, but plenty to enjoy, decent acting, it has soul, character, charm and a BIG heart! Transformers that actually look and sound like they are supposed to in their G1 forms instead of completely unrecognisable mess caused by Bay!The robot sizes are now accurate and true to their original counterparts, the Decepticons are actually cunning and deceptive with personality! It has some mind blowing Cybertron scenes, though only a little taster of what's to come, but far superior to what we got in Transformers 2007 and Transformers Dark of The Moon.Hailee Steinfeld is perfect as the lead with an actual story arc, far superior to the most annoying guy on the planet Shia LaBeouf. I've rated this movie 9 out of ten, because there is always room for improvement, which I'm sure if Travis and his team can carry on producing this level of quality, the sequel will be even more awesome!Ladies/Gents please ignore any negative reviews about this movie, this film is pure nostalgic, 80's heaven with a pumping 80's soundtrack from start to finish!
This movie is massively underrated in my opinion
Go and see this movie if you want the true real live action Transformers!Forget the Bay trash, even the first one!",Bumblebee
1375,guuspaiva,Milking the franchise,6,11 April 2019,"Predictable and easy plot, boring characters and action scenes, nothing new from the old transformers movies.",Bumblebee
1376,spacewhalenow,Meh,4,3 April 2019,Love Bumblebee.... But the movie was more about annoying Hally Seinfeld and her 1st world problems. Could have been way better.,Bumblebee
1377,stoneage-80179,Don't waste your time or money!!!,1,1 March 2019,"I wanted to like it, but I just couldn't. Acting was terrible, storyline was predictable, CG was garbage, and the list goes on. Watch at your own risk.",Bumblebee
