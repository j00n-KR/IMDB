0,CinemaSerf,"Maybe a bit simplistic, but still quite a touching drama.",7,20 March 2021,"There are two standout performances here - Justin Timberlake in the title role and Ryder Allen as ""Sam"". The former is an ex-con who returns to live with his grandmother after a twelve year stretch. She is looking after the latter, a young boy neglected by his largely absent (junkie) mother and her violent boyfriend. Young ""Sam"" also has a pretty blurred gender identification. He likes many things traditionally attributed to girls and initially, anyway, ""Palmer"" has some difficulty comprehending and accepting this behaviour. The untimely death of the old lady and the return of the liability parents focus the relationship between the two and both have to adapt. The drama is a little predictable, but the two anchor efforts are engaging, the potent writing doesn't shy away from some difficult topics - bullying, drugs, violence and bigotry, and overall we are presented with a considered depiction of two characters looking out for each other.",Palmer
1,deloudelouvain,For a drama not bad but a bit slow.,6,25 July 2021,"Palmer isn't a bad movie, let that be clear, but it's not the greatest movie either. It's good enough to watch once but I don't need to watch again in the fututre. The story is engaging, but it lacks a bit of oomph, feels slow at times (certainly in the first part). It's a gripping story but it feels a bit like déjà-vu. The acting was good and that from the whole cast. Justin Timberlake did a good job playing his character, a bit different than what we're used from him, and for a kid Ryder Allen was very convincing in his role. In the drama genre Palmer is a good movie, but if that's not really your genre of movies (like me) I think a one time viewing will be enough for this one.",Palmer
2,Edvis-1997,7,7,14 February 2021,"It was really nice movie. I can't say that this film is masterclass or masterpiece but it's standing above average,ordinary movies. Plot was interesting to watch and easy to fallow. Acting was on point,high quality. I would like it to be a little bit deeper and maybe had more harsh moments but it didn't disappoint me. The best film of 2021 so far.",Palmer
3,ops-52535,this was not...,7,31 January 2021,"Bad at all, except for an abrupt everything is gonna be allrait as mr marley sang once upon a time to woman that shouldnt cry because everything is better than nothing at all, and if it hadnt been for that cheesy ending...but by all means its a sad and tragic but ever so uplifting drama, carried on mr timberlake and a young actor by the name ryder allen shoulders, who at moments made my ovula drivel and shake from crampy tearjerking convulsions, great dynamics to say the least.because its a film against all odds, the convict, and the neglected child, of a methaddicted mother that criss crosses and leaves when she wants and leaves the childcare to closest neighbour on a nonwritten agreement with the local child services, until the neighbour dies and the convict that lives with his grandma (the neighbour) get the unwilling job to care for a child he doesnt like...(cant tell more)its a grumpy and gritty justin t. we meet and that he does pretty well.im not familiar with timberlake on the silver screen but he doesnt dissapoint the grumpy old man. ''palmer'' may feel a little long and has a rather unrealistic finale except for that its a recommend...p.s. if you dont feel the urge to cry at least once you must be a cold stone...",Palmer
4,cruise01,Heartwarming story.,8,31 January 2021,"4 out of 5 stars.Palmer is a good drama film about an ex con Palmer (Justin Timberlake) who moves in with his grandmother Vivian (June Quibb). While trying to get back into society. He gets a janitor job at a school. While Vivian watches over there neighbors kid Sam (Ryder Allen) who is different. His mindset sees himself as a princess. Sams mother played by Juno Temple is a drug addict and unfit to watch over her kid. As she disappears for a long period of time. When Palmer is left alone. He is next up in watching over Sam. Which he respects Sam for who he is. While taking Sam to his friends house for tea parties. And Sams teacher Maggie (Alisha Wainwright) inviting them over for dinner.Good plot. Heartwarming story. Palmer having a rough past in making poor decisions that landed him in prison. Difficult to adjust to Sams personality. He adapts and respects the kid for who he is. While some townspeople are judgmental. Palmer and Maggie form a friendship over Sam. Then, his drug addict mother returns with her abusive boyfriend that causes conflict with Palmer trying to raise Sam. Which can be a little predictable with where it goes.Great cast. Justin Timberlake did a great job with his performance. June Squibb and Juno Temple all did good. Alisha Wainwright did a wonderful job as well. And Ryder Allen performance is wonderful.It is a good touching emotional feel good drama film that delivers with the performances and story.",Palmer
5,zkonedog,Caught Between Family Feel-Good Piece And Gritty Comeback Drama,5,30 January 2021,"Somewhere lurking in the depths of ""Palmer"" there exists a really solid story/film. Sadly, that better version of itself never materializes due to the tone of the picture being caught between ""family feel-good"" and ""gritty drama"". Had this movie made up its mind one way or the other, it could have perhaps soared to greater heights.For a very basic overview, ""Palmer"" sees the titular character (played by Justin Timberlake) return to his hometown after a prison stay. While living with his grandmother (June Squibb), Palmer is introduced to Sam (Ryder Allen), a boy next door who sort of self-identifies as a girl (if not ""officially""). When Sam's drug-troubled mother (Juno Temple) disappears for long stretches of time, Palmer becomes a de facto father figure for Sam--a relationship that helps both individuals to grow.Despite an intriguing idea, it was fairly clear what ""Palmer"" suffers from as a movie (and thus why it gets a middling five stars from me): it is caught between tonal polarities. On one hand, this could have been a sweet, family-around-the-TV type drama that promotes themes of acceptance and being true to one's self. On the other hand, it could have been a gritty, R-rated drama of Palmer's comeback story--exorcising old demons and fighting his way back into society. Unfortunately, the film dabbles in both and comes out worse the wear for it. Saccharine moments are interspersed with partial-nudity sex scenes and heavy drug abuse themes. In other words: you wouldn't be comfortable watching this with your granny, yet it isn't nearly good enough to hold up as a standalone drama.One undeniable positive here: the performance of Timberlake in the lead role. Not necessarily award-winning, but the former boy band star once again proves that he's a legitimate actor (this time with dramatic chops). Young Allen is also affecting, while Alisha Wainwright turns in a solid performance as a teacher invested in the Palmer proceedings.Overall, I think ""Palmer"" is best viewed as an achievement for Apple+ original content rather than as a classic movie in and of itself. Getting Timberlake was huge for the Apple content-machine, and such ""gets"" will continue opening doors to even better original films from them in the future. That road is paved with efforts like this one.",Palmer
6,matthewssilverhammer,Moving,8,15 February 2021,"A relatively predictable southern indie, but Palmer & Sam's emotional core is incredible, mainly because of how fantastic the Sam character & Ryder Allen's performance are. The handling of childhood queerness is frank & kind, never letting social politics get in the way of empathy. The biggest flaw is Timberlake; he gives it his all, but I can't help but wonder if this would be an all-timer with an actor of more gravitas (and less baggage) in the lead. It still moved me to tears in the end.",Palmer
7,southdavid,Palmer Violet.,6,14 April 2021,"Keeping up my record of watching 100% of the movies available on Apple TV, ""Palmer"" is a lo-fi indie film with all the qualities and criticisms that you might come to expect of a typical example of ""indie drama"".Released from Prison, Palmer (Justin Timberlake) returns home to live with his grandmother Vivian (June Squibb), in an attempt to get his life back on track. Vivian often looks after a boy Sam (Ryder Allen) who lives nearby when his mother, Shelly (Juno Temple) who has substance abuse issues, disappears for long periods. It's on one such interlude that Vivian passes away, leaving Palmer as the only person to look after Sam, whose propensity for more traditionally female interests makes him a natural target at school. Though distant at first, the two bond, until Shelly reappears and looks to take her son home.I don't mean to be dismissive when I declare ""Palmer"" as 'indie', that's quite a broad stroke to give to a film - but what I mean by that is that if 'indie' films have a typical model it's one of terrific performances but perhaps a wayward or unfocused plot - and that's exactly the way I'd describe this film. There are three really good performances. Timberlake has less to do than others, Palmer is buttoned down anger and resentment until the Sam gets through his defences, but he does it well. Juno Temple remains one of the most versatile actresses working at the moment, and druggy nightmare Shelly is another shift. Ryder Allen too in his first credited performance is wonderful and heartbreaking as Sam remains true to who he is despite the difficulties it causes him and the external pressure to conform.The films plot is a bit unfocused though, meandering around Palmer's life for the first hour or so before only then settling into the relationship between the two that forms the backbone for the last section. It doesn't completely ruin the entire experience which, again, has wonderful performances but it does stop me from thinking better about the brave film that Fischer Stevens has produced.",Palmer
8,jtindahouse,Great characters and the rest flows from there,9,8 March 2021,"Throughout his acting career I've always thought of Justin Timberlake as the guy who likes to come in and take the ""cool guy"" roles, which to be fair is basically just him being him ('The Social Network' is probably the best example of this). However in 'Palmer', while his character was still admittedly a pretty cool guy, he had to actually find some other levels and show off his acting talents. So can Timberlake actually act? The answer to that would have to be a firm yes. He really impressed me in this movie.Early on in the film though it was June Squibb who was stealing the show. She's such a wonderful actress. She can switch between the most serious of serious scenes and then be extremely funny a moment later. I could watch that woman act every day for the rest of my life happily. She wasn't in a huge amount of the movie unfortunately, but she was in enough to leave a lasting impression. Finally, speaking of actors who impressed me, Ryder Allen was excellent. So many child actors come across as annoying and unlikeable. Allen was exactly the opposite. I loved that kid and wanted more of him.Once you have likeable characters in a movie everything else tends to take care of itself. The story is both heart-breaking and heart-warming at the same time. Every character's actions are both understandable and yet also sometimes hard to comprehend. It was a very well written movie in that respect. The film is nearly two hours long, yet the first time I checked how long there was to go there was only 5 minutes remaining. I was entranced by this story. This is a really good film that absolutely must be put on your watchlist immediately.",Palmer
9,kwenchow,"A bit touching at certain point, but overall full of boring conversation, and annoying overuse scene! Not recommended!",2,9 February 2021,"This film start with a man ""Palmer"" riding a bus, and he back to his grandmother house scene!

Another disappointed film!",Palmer
10,yusufpiskin,'Palmer' may be Justin Timberlake's first Oscar nomination.,9,9 February 2021,"Gotta hand it to young Ryder Allen for a remarkable performance. Palmer is a great story that breaks your heart at moments, but also touches it and gives you hope in the potential for good in people. It was also well shot, edited, and composed.The importance of second chances in a movie that with move your heart more than once, it maybe a little bit long but the feeling after watching it is something you won't regret.Justin Timberlake make a performance so good about a man that find in a very special kid the opportunity to see things in a very different ways, to learn how to change and be good after everything bad that has happen in your life.Life has very funny ways to make you better",Palmer
11,ks-60500,Justin personal best,5,22 March 2021,"Timberland is position as a comedian for the past 10 years in movie world. This performance changed himself to a real actor. Having said this kind of theme of an grown up with special past along with a special kids be filmed many times, but the focus more on the acting and how story been told. Patience required for this kind of movie.",Palmer
12,valleyjohn,two great performances,8,10 April 2021,"Justin Timberlake is a very underrated actor . Nearly everything I've seen him in , he looks a natural. I'm not sure if he did acting before music but it wouldn't surprise me at all . In Palmer he has some serious competition in child actor Ryder Allen who is fantastic as Sam an outcast boy from a troubled home.Timberlake play a man called Eddie , who After 12 years in prison, returns home to put his life back together and forms an unlikely bond with Sam, but Eddie's past threatens to ruin his new life and family.What I like about this film is the innocence of youth. The kid has serious problems at home with a drug addicted mum and at school with bullies because of his obvious confused sexuality yet he's incredibly happy .He carries on with life dressing in girls clothing and doing everyone a girl of his age would do and because he's so young , he doesn't think it's odd at all , that a boy would do that . It's others who have the problem.What this film shows is that people can be really horrible in life . Especially small town , backward country people who care more about going to church than treating people correctly.Thankful in this case , Palmer is one of the good guys and has learned the hard way what right and wrong is .I enjoyed this film . It's a little depressing in parts but ultimately it puts a big smile on your face .",Palmer
13,leftbanker-1,Third Best Movie About Trans-Gender Children I've Seen this Week,6,2 February 2021,"The official storyline of the film states, ""An American heartland story that is very timely and unfortunately very pervasive in our culture."" As my title gag points out, it's very pervasive in our pop culture, but is it really a major part of American life? What percentage of children fall into the Sam category? From the storyline statement and the attention this gets in pop culture, you'd think that one in three children are in the wrong bodies.The movie points out that the child has a terrible to non-existent home life with a junkie ho mama and nothing of a male role model in his life, at least before Palmer. No one has made an effort to give the boy any sort of male orientation except Palmer drinking beer in front of him. Instead of giving in to the every whim of the child-not recommended in good parenting-why not lead him down another option in life? There is absolutely nothing wrong with showing boys how to be boys.The movie seems to lean towards the boy's orientation as learned behavior. So why can't he unlearn it? The kid is slightly overweight and looks like he'd drop dead if he did a push-up, so why not teach him how to be a strong kid? Cookies? How about a piece of fruit? No wonder he's a little tub of guts. It isn't the kid's fault, it's bad adult guidance. Another learned behavior is smoking. What's the deal with smoking? My lungs hurt just watching everyone huffing away.I'm not saying you have to go all Sergeant York on the kid, just teach him how to take care of his body. Turn off the TV and go take a run in the park with him. Not all kids need to be sport stars, but physical fitness is within the grasp of everyone.Why does Palmer have to write the letter to the Princess club? Is the kid illiterate? Write your own letter, kid. And does that church really need his grandmother's house more than he does? What vultures!Once again, the film was too long by at least twenty minutes, which is a lot. Other than the bloated run-time, the film was very well produced from top to bottom: good music, a very realistic atmosphere or the rural South, and good acting form everyone involved. The script? Eh. A bit too trite, too facile, too after-school specially, but once you go into a crusading project like this, there isn't any other place to go, I would imagine.The problem is, there are way too many people having children who shouldn't. You may argue with other things I've put in this review, but few people could argue with this.",Palmer
14,blott2319-1,"Decent, even if it's predictable",7,13 February 2021,"Palmer is a story that I feel like we've all seen before. While it has a unique combination of elements to keep it interesting, this definitely comes across like an amalgamation of a Lifetime movie and an after-school special. It is a story about an ex-convict who befriends a young boy. I suppose what is meant to set this film apart from others like it is the fact that the young boy is not gender binary. They certainly address this in some ways, and he is met by some harsh opposition because the town he lives in seems quite conservative and old-fashioned. But it's not the primary topic of conversation and is treated like anything that a person might have which makes them a subject of ridicule by others around them. I actually appreciated that they didn't push it too hard, because it could have made the film feel preachy, instead it was handled with tact and grace. Plus, it is ridiculously hard not to like young Ryder Allen from the moment you meet him. This kid is extremely cute and charming, so I hope he gets more opportunities in Hollywood.The plot moves at a very slow pace, and it feels even more tedious because most of the things that happen in Palmer are quite predictable. In fact, the most surprising element of the movie are some of the things that happen which don't lead to any negative consequences. There's one scene in particular that I thought was terrible, and in the real world would probably be a huge problem, but in this movie it was glossed over as if it was the right thing for Palmer to do. The only other thing that was at all unexpected in Palmer was the two overly-graphic sex scenes. These feel ridiculously out of a place in a film that could otherwise be somewhat family-friendly. Personally, I think that was a big mistake because the studio just limited their audience more, and they did nothing to further the narrative. Finally, I will mention that Justin Timberlake continues to prove he has decent acting chops. This isn't the most complex role to play, but he handled it well. I'm not sure Palmer is going to be a big hit for most people, but as a small indie drama, I think it is not bad.",Palmer

17,Sir_AmirSyarif,"Clichéd and overdone, but still offers a thought-provoking and emotionally powerful drama",6,29 January 2021,"Despite of its clichéd and overdone nature of the narrative, Fisher Stevens' 'Palmer' offers a thought-provoking and emotionally powerful drama about acceptance and second chances. There are few films that are willing to approach the subject matter of gender identity and the bullying that comes from that, and yet this film knows how far to go and what the focus of the story should be about. Both Justin Timberlake and Ryder Allen deliver outstanding performances, as well as the rest of the cast.",Palmer
18,kjproulx,A Solid Drama with Some Issues,7,4 February 2021,"Before The Social Network was released back in 2010, I never thought of Justin Timberlake as an actor. Yes, he was solid in the film Alpha Dog, but I believe that being directed by David Fincher really broadened his horizons. Starring in films like Friends with Benefits, Trouble with the Curve, or even In Time, he has proven that there's more to him than meets the eye in terms of acting. Palmer only furthered those thoughts for me. While Timberlake never seems to choose projects that will win him awards, he's always very, very solid in whichever role he does take. Palmer has many similar tropes to movies you've seen before, but here's why the subject matter, along with a great central performance by Timberlake, warrants a viewing.After serving time for over a decade, Eddie Palmer (Justin Timberlake) returns home to live with his grandmother, only to see that a troubled family lives next door. Their young boy Sam eventually forms a bond with Palmer, even though Palmer wants literally nothing to do with him when the film opens. Struggling to fit in for being different than other boys in his school, Palmer slowly becomes the father figure that this boy may just need in his life. This sort of premise has been done time and time again, just in different variations. What set it aside from all the others for me though, was the fact that the screenplay by Cheryl Guerriero was far better than I expected it to be.Yes, when breaking the overall movie down, there are some very rushed aspects of the story in the third act, but the dramatic elements to the film felt very authentic. You could tell this was a story that came from the heart. I believed the majority of the dialogue that nearly every character had, which is why I also feel that this movie sputtered slightly towards the end. As much as I loved the dialogue written for these performers, the meat of the story is whether or not Palmer is the right fit for Sam and certain elements of that are sort of thrown away in the third act. There is a resolution to everything, but it feels rushed in comparison with the rest of the film.Now to dive into the performances, because this is a film that relies heavily on selling the premise at hand. As I said, I've always enjoyed the on-screen presence of Justin Timberlake and I truly believe that there is an argument to be made here that he's never been better. I was engaged in this film because of his committed performance. On top of that, young Ryder Allen played off him incredibly well and their bond made this film so much more likeable. Alisha Wainwright as Maggie was also excellent, and Juno Temple as Sam's mother Shelly has a couple of scene-stealing moments as well.In the end, Palmer is the type of film that's designed to be a tear-jerker and those types of films can feel extremely heavy-handed, but I'm just glad to say this one doesn't. It took me on an emotional journey and I was in tears by the end, but it never felt forced. Sadly, the conclusion is far too rushed and revelations and answers are brushed over multiple times. It's almost as though this movie was too focused on creating dramatic scenes that it forgot how to properly reach a conclusion. Still, I really enjoyed watching it and I believe it's worth your time. Palmer is now streaming on Apple TV+.",Palmer
19,tm-sheehan,Great performances by Justin Timberlake and Ryder Allen,8,31 January 2021,"Thanks Greg for the thumbs up on this filmMy Review - Palmer Apple TV+My Rating 8/10Justin Timberlake's latest movie is definitely one of his finest performances as Eddie Palmer a former high school football star who returns home after 12 years in prison. Now with all the problems an ex -convict has to try to put his life back together and the small town prejudices that even the simplest tasks like looking for work entails.
Palmer moves back home with his grandmother and forms an unlikely bond with Sam, an unusual boy from a troubled home living in a trailer parked on Palmer's Grandmother's land .
The young boy's mother Shelley is a totally dysfunctional drug addict living with a drunken bully in an environment totally unsuitable for a young child.
Eddie steps in reluctantly to try and help young Sam when Sam's mother disappears on a bender which eventually results in circumstances that eventually threatens Palmer's freedom once again.
No spoilers you can fill in the blanks or better still watch the movie.
I have to praise another wonderful child performance by Ryder Allen as young Sam in a very difficult role as a child of uncertain gender identification.
This is the aspect of Palmer I enjoyed most as both Palmer and Sam are prisoners of sorts and cling to each other.
Palmer obviously fresh out of one prison and young Sam a prisoner of Society's gender conformity expectations.
Palmer is well written and Co- Produced by Cheryl Guerrero well directed by Fisher Steven's and well acted by the entire cast.
It's a must see on Apple +!",Palmer

Now with smarter fakes.This movie is really slow. It's mis-titled for starters. It should be called Sam, or Palmer and Sam, or The Crying Contest. Seriously, almost every character cries and wants the title.Overall this is a predictable story, troubled child and on and on, not much happens really, and the ending, well, just sort of ends. I guess that's what they call a movie these days.I like JT, but he's downright cringey in this in his multiple attempts to force himself to cry. 3 stars for his performance, not much else is good or worth watching. It's not realistic, multiple inconsistencies, and the fact that JT wants to take care of a kid he only knew for a few days, on a $60/day job, with no savings, and no where to live. Well, that's just rubbish.",Palmer

25,akcenat,"A one-time stream drama ""Palmer"" is too predictable, being just a nice little feel-good (TV) movie",6,13 February 2021,"Without question, this is Justin Timberlake's best performance to date, yet it won't take a rocket scientist to determine how quickly Palmer (JT) and Sam (Ryder Allen) bond with each other, considering they're both outcasts in a southern town. Also, the story stumbles during its third act, coupled with the expected return of Sam's mother (Juno Temple) to the screen, still there is nothing she can do except looking alternatively pathetic and hysterical. It doesn't help that the film trots out so many clichés about the 'South' (and the hardscrabble folks who live there). In the end, nothing about this film is downright bad, but ""Palmer"" never lives up to what could have elevated the story and J. Timberlake's performance. Also, movie does nothing new in its story, playing safe rather than bringing something new to the table, being just a decent distraction from all the madness with COVID-19 pandemic right now, with some lovely moments between Timberlake and Allen that is primed for a reunion in something more deserving of their talents.Rating: 6+ Watchable",Palmer
26,iamjamalwhite,A guide to poor parenting,7,10 June 2021,"Good movie which we enjoyed. Palmer is a local HS football quarterback that falls on hard times after an injury kills his NFL dreams, does time and comes back to his hometown to live with his Grandmother. The underlying theme is poor parenting. If you are a crack addicted, community property woman your child may not turn out like all the other kids. If you are a felon, your child may not turn out like all the other kids. It is interesting how the adolescent mind deals with trauma. Some people follow their parents into alcohol or drugs or crime at a rate of about three-times the normal citizen. This little boy went another dangerous route and the movie tries to deal with this decision. We all know these kids, outcasts, weirdos. This movie does a good job looking at the big heart of the child and the way the world around him deals with his oddity. The mistake is when society is forced to accept the oddity as normal behavior. Like when the runt of the litter gets picked on with dogs or the military troops who can't keep up so they lower the requirements to include him. That needs to be addressed and fixed. Children crave boundaries. If your mom is a crack addicted community property woman, good luck! Heart warming film. I'd recommend it.",Palmer
27,DeBBss,7/10 for the amazing performances,7,3 April 2021,"The best part about Palmer was the characters and acting, but the story was a meh for me. I've seen plenty of films with a very similar plot about redemption and second chances. There's just not much innovation with it's story. It is wholesome and satisfying to watch, so it kept me going even though I've seen this story plenty of times. But what makes me give Palmer a 7/10 was the performances. Justin Timberlake gives his best performance as an actor in Palmer, and Ryder Allen is one of the best child actors I've seen in a while. All of the performances were just really great, which helps pull the story. Overall, it's a solid movie; it'll pull the heartstrings and give you a satisfying conclusion.",Palmer
28,henrycoles9,So incredibly poignant,10,2 February 2021,"This is the poignant, heartrending drama I crave all the time. Justin Timberlake shines with a bang as a former prisoner who, while struggling to get back on the straight and narrow, finds that responsibility for a young boy living next door with a negligent mother has fallen to him. I particularly liked Palmer's loving and helpful attitude toward Sam's (Ryder Allen) girlish tendencies, defending the boy against bigoted bullies and assuring him there was nothing wrong with him liking girls' stuff.

35,celt007,Justin Timberlake fantastic!,8,31 January 2021,"Slow moving drama that builds near the end and Justin Timberlake gives a powerful masterful , restrained performance . Justin plays Palmer an ex convict in this moving story of love and responsibility .Palmer relationship with
His neighbour Sam , played by Ryder Allen, gives an equally brilliant performance as a child dealing with an absent abusive drug addicted mother while the entire time being bullied for his effeminate traits .",Palmer
36,Lewis_Heather787,Breakout Performance !,7,6 February 2021,"Now this film was surprising, to be fair I wasn't expecting much, however I'm not sure my lack of expectation had any impact on feelings about the film. I did see the trailer for this a while back and didn't really think anything of it, thankfully the film is much better than the trailer.This film, for me, is the breakout performance from Justin Timberlake. Now for years I have always thought that he only appeared in films due to his fame and that he didn't really have any talent. He would always play the cocky, self centred, handsome guy. There was no other level to his performances, to me anyway they were always the same. I have never taken him seriously whatsoever, that is until now. ""Palmer"" is not just a good performance from Timberlake, it is a fantastic performance that I feel even deserves award consideration. I know that is a giant leap from being just that famous singer that appears in films to Oscar worthy performances, however I feel that its warranted. He is absolutely terrific in the lead role of Palmer, it is such an understated performance for the majority. I don't see him ""transforming"" or going deep in ""method"" acting, its just an honest and phenomenal performance from start to finish. If this is the level that he can act too, why has he waited so long to show everyone. From not liking the guy that much I cant wait to see his next project.Now the story is not as straight forward as you might think, there are a ton of story threads in this film. Thankfully all of them get there screen time. The main focus is Palmer getting out of prison and restarting his life. Add the introduction of an ""abandoned"" little boy who lives next door, into Palmer and his grandmothers lives. Obviously the most serious topic of the film deals with people being able to accept that Sam, the little boy, is gay. It is a very difficult topic to get right and sensitive one at that, personally I felt the film handled it really well. However there is a section of our society that will hate this film regardless if it handled it well or not......its sad but true. Plus enter Sam's drugged up mother and dodgy boyfriend, Palmer's love interest, social services. There is a lot going on in this film however all of it works in harmony, all these threads have satisfying conclusions, which is rare to see.I'd have to also mention the great writing and directing of this film, without them both it wouldn't be as affective, especially emotionally. In the wrong hands this film could be to confusing or would prioritised some elements of the film more than others.Overall its 70% out 100 its a surprisingly good film and one absolutely incredible performance from Justin Timberlake who I thought was stellar. Now I never thought I'd ever say that hahaha. To be honest its great acting overall. Complex, relevant, interesting, heart warming story with some great writing. This film delivers what its selling and then some.",Palmer

38,atractiveeyes,Masterpiece,10,31 January 2021,"I think this is my favorite movie of 2021 already. It's a masterpiece. It's simple yet so powerful, emotional and touching. Its story is so beautiful and so important with interesting topics like friendship, parenting, being your true self and many others. Justin Timberlake gives a superb performance and the little kid is just amazing. It is also very well written. The character study is great and so is the storytelling. Don't listen to the bad reviews and give this great movie a watch, you won't regret it. Palmer is a deep important well made movie that deserves better appreciation.",Palmer
39,somf,Solid acting elevated this fine film,8,30 January 2021,"I know I have seen Juno Temple before, but really was not familiar with her. But she was so powerful in this film. Not sure if she is eligible this year or next but she deserves a best supporting actress nomination for this role. Timberlake and everyone else did a very nice job, but Temple had a couple scenes that simply blew me away.Nice message. Almost wish it had been toned down a bit to allow younger viewers to learn from the film, but that would have diminished some of the film's power. Highly recommend.",Palmer

41,silicontourist,The Adgenda Was About Gender And It Was Handled Perfectly!,10,31 January 2021,"Though I never listen to the music of Justin Timberlake (I like Rock, Metal and proper R&B Soul music), I have watched him in a lot of films. He was good in his first film and he has gotten better with each one after so, I'm pretty sure he would have held the same position of star status he currently enjoys even if he had never sung a single note. The new kid on the film set (he is to me as I have not seen him in any other film), Ryder Allen, had his role totally out there. He was outstandingly brilliant and more so considering the gender subject matter he was portraying.
The only thing I found negative about him, Ryder, was that it was a shame for him to have such a big wobbly beer belly on him at such a young age....lol
For me this is (or at least it should be, IMHO) this years Oscar winner for both director and the 2 leading actors. There should be a special double winner Oscar presentation with one going to Justin and one to Ryder.The reviews I have read from the people giving a thumbs down to this film are so insipidly childish. I say that harshly because I get really pissed off at people who dislike a film because it wasn't what they expected.. What? Are they stupid? The first rule for having a clear mind (not empty as some of you have shown) and unbiased viewing, listening etc is, DON'T make expectations, Don't create the scenario in your head/mind before you have even viewed/listened to anything. Some peoples minds are just so clogged up with what they want from life they can no longer function unfettered.",Palmer
42,chandean-69762,Palmer 2021 Review,8,31 January 2021,"""How good could a Apple TV film with Justin Timberlake really be?"" is what I asked myself as I scrolled through Apple TV for the first time.
Oh boy was I surprised.
Both Justin Timberlake and Ryder Allen give surprisingly good and captivating performances.
This film really tugs at your heart and gets you really invested in these characters. The only issue I have with the story is that I feel like this film had a pretty slow burn in the beginning. However, after a good thirty minutes you get to learn about the characters, their past, and their struggles and you begin to get attached to them and the relationships they form.
The cinematography was simple but nice. The score was warming with a nice acoustic guitar over most of the film, and the plot and characters were really the highlight of this film.
Definitely watch this whenever you get a chance.",Palmer
43,cscott2331,Very sweet.,9,30 January 2021,"I don't know why in the hell people are complaining it's cliche, it's messy blah blah blah. You know form the previews what you're getting. An x-con with a heart of gold. A boy in the wrong body, gay, confused, trans and to top it off he's saddled with a druggie mom. You know what's going to happen. Doesn't make it any the less heartwarming and sweet. I think JT (Palmer) did a great job, I've always thought he was a decent actor. Sam was really good, as far a child actor go, I think he's got it! It's a feel good movie, so if you don't like that kind of movie, then don't watch it. Pretty simple if you ask me. If you like a sweet film then watch it.",Palmer
44,alshamari-marwa,Good but sad,7,12 February 2021,"Justin Timberlake made the movie, i think there was a lot of hard scenes and he was amazing with the young Ryder Allen , the story was good but it needed more. Director is Fisher Stevens .
the movie is sad so if you don't like drama i don't recommend it .",Palmer
45,PaxtonMalloy,By the book doesn't need to be bad thing,7,30 January 2021,"It is funny to me how often people expect something from a movie that it never promised. The gist of the ""official"" critics basically was that is by the numbers and also shy's away from the gritty parts. These are valid points to be made but at the same time what did you expect? This is a production for apple TV+. So of course they pick someone with mass appeal and than deliver something pleasing not to gritty.Don't get me wrong. I am all for more realism, for more creativity and bold choices. But I just know an apple TV+ production is not the room for that. So let's not judge the movie by what it could be but what it is. Is a very solid drama. It is never great but it is good.Timberlake even though I like him has been very mediocre in his roles. I will give him credit here. It is his best performance. Again it isn't great but it is pretty good. I gotta say that even though Juno Temple is barely in this she has the best scene close to the end. Alisha Wainright is ok but doesn't really stand out at any moment and even though I read the opposite I don't feel chemistry with her and Timberlake. Little Ryder Allen of course is adorable. At this moment the movie has a 7.1 rating and that is right on the mark. It is nice and solid drama. If you are looking for better, more original versions of that kind of movie you have to watch the one's from smaller studios and Indy productions because they are in the business of telling a story that they wanna tell and not to please an audience.",Palmer
46,jmvscotland,Very nearly the perfect drama - WATCH OUT FOR RYDER ALLEN - TERRIFIC!!,8,22 April 2021,"You know, just very occasionally, an actor comes along, appears in one movie and you just KNOW that that actor has a serious future in cinema.I'm not talking here of Justin or any of the other leads in ""Palmer"". Who I am talking about is young Ryder Allen who plays Sam. The movie is excellent in my view and that, for me, is in large part due to this young man's appearance here. He was truly excellent in every scene he appeared in and I look forward to seeing more from him in the future. He is just wonderful.""Palmer"" is an involving tale of weakness and anger and vulnerability that kept me rivetted for the whole 110 minutes.Highly recommendable.JMV.",Palmer
47,catfanatic888,Justin Timberlake is a SUPERSTAR!,8,5 February 2021,"JT is an incredible musician, humanitarian, and an incredible actor! He has been overlooked by the Academy for far too long.

The scrip was pitch perfect! Check this one out!",Palmer
48,spipeschi,An Ordinary Premise With An Extraordinary Performance,8,5 November 2021,"Headlined by a terrific Justin Timberlake, Palmer is typical melodrama and predictable outcome however it's the journey and the human spirit that triumphs over questionable human nature and restores dignity to an otherwise complicated situation.Highly recommended.",Palmer

Ryder Allen who plays Sam is an actor to watch, he had me in tears and is talented already at such a young age! Every one was cast perfectly and if you watch this without a tear I would be surprised.

56,mvahidalizadeh,A nice drama that feels like the real-life,7,3 March 2021,"I remember I saw Justin Timberlake's concert in Madison Square Garden in 2018. I was amazed by his talent. He was singing, dancing, and playing. After watching this movie, I found out that Justin is a great actor as well. This is a movie about a boy with an addicted mom. The boy and his mom are living in a trailer beside a house. The house is owned by a very kind old woman. She takes care of the boy when his mom goes away from time to time.
At the beginning of the story, Palmer comes back to his grand ma's house. He is just released from jail. When he comes back, he meets the boy who visits her grandma whenever his mom is away. In this movie, you see a wide variety of locations, like a school, a house, or natural places. I didn't see anything special on sound effects and background music. But, they were ok. I liked the positioning of the camera in different scenes. I recommend this movie to drama fans and Justin Timberlake's fans.",Palmer

It has almost zero plot twists from the outset and you can pretty much see where it's going. It's a one and done plot, no deep sub plots or anything. But in this sense it's Ok, it's a nice little story. Just don't expect much depth to it. This is one you sit down, watch knowing what's gonna happen, and are OK with it.Cinematography was good but it looked a little dark and dreary at times, probably to give mood.

That is, a troubled man gets a new look on life when taking care of someone weaker than himself. The story and script are pedestrian but I am still rating this as ""6"" (somewhat above average) on the strength of Justin Timberlake's performance which is very good as well as the 2 main supporting players (Ryder Allen as Sam and Alisha Wainwright as Maggie). The movie is watchable if you have Apple TV already but I wouldn't sign up for Apple TV just for this movie.",Palmer

This drama has many similar tropes to other movies, but it provides an important social lesson along with a best-ever central performance by Justin Timberlake. A completely predictable narrative is too focused on creating dramatic scenes that it forgot how to properly reach a conclusion. There are some very rushed aspects of the story in the third act, but the dramatic elements of the film feel very authentic. There is no emotional blackmail, only real human interaction with the ordeal of the characters who all remind us, that parenting is more about understanding than biology.",Palmer

To me this was just ok. Overall it's a warming story and all the actors gave good performances, especially Justin Timberlake and the kid who plays 'Sam'.However, the story along with Timberlake's character was slightly predictable and this isn't the type of movie that sticks with you that you remember for years to come.While I enjoyed the relationship between the 2 main characters, there wasn't actually much drama between them or them having to overcome any obstacles / differences in their own relationship.
Timberlake's character is pretty accepting of the boys character straight away, which isn't bad, but it doesn't provide any drama at all. Rather the drama for them comes from the rest of the world and this is what makes it predictable.",Palmer

108,Glenn_K9,Amazing Performance and a Touching Story,10,30 January 2021,"Out of the gate I was not hopeful, by half way through I was balling like a 12 year old girl. Honestly I have always loved Justin's acting and he's so good at it but devotes more time to his music. This moving piece is totally worthy of a best actor award. A truly unique man recently dismissed from prison however at rock bottom, jobless, living with his aunt and a young transvestite male with a special personality and an astounding performance for this character that you just can't help yourself to love. Frequently abandoned by is crackhead mom and left stranded with his grandmother most of the time by synchronicity forms an unexpected, loving bond that is extremely fragile due to surrounding circumstances between Palmer and Sam played by Ryder Allen. This honestly is one movie that you'll want to take in. This incredible cast and their energies mix so well for an award winning movie. Hey Justin maybe this will be another one on the mantle. Well deserved without any reserve. So watch this and grab some kleenex.",Palmer
109,turdymac,Mr. Timberlake..,8,7 February 2021,"Coming from a person who grew up absolutely despising ""boy bands"" and the like, Mr. Timberlake was often a butt of jokes in my circle. To be honest, I looked at him as a talentless fabrication in the 90's. I would have never imagined an entertainer that I looked at as so lacking prove me so wrong. I enjoyed this movie very much. The story was touching and the acting was very good but what brought it was Mr. Timberlake. I would have never have thought he could pull off a roll such as this. I give my rating because of his performance. Quite impressive to say the least. I almost equate this to Shia in ""The Peanut Butter Falcon"". Great job by all.",Palmer

He portrays a lot of emotions convincingly in this one!The love interest is a little cheesy and expected - but you believe it and you're rooting for them by the end!!Maybe not what everyone focused on but Juno Temple - Sam's mother - SCARILY convincing in her role - so well done!Also Sam himself - I never really wanted to admit that there are some bad child actors - I wanted to be nice to them - but there are some bad one...this kid Ryder Allen is genius!! Hits all the notes and you just love the character.So the acting was on point!It's slow moving for a modern movie - I liked that about it - they really got to build up the characters before the final action/sDefinitely not a family movie - but if a former criminal from Louisiana can love and accept a boy who ""acts like a girl"" - so can the rest of us!! It brings conversations to the forefront that are worth having.I watched it with my dad (I'm 21) - cool experience - but I guess it would be a good movie to watch a couple?

Well written, great acting, and gutwrenchingly honest",8,7 February 2021,"I don't know if all the possible realities portrayed are as common or as valid as real life often shows us, but within the logic and the narrative of the story, all the emotions were so human, and so relatable, I cried a few times troughout the movie. No emotional blackmail, but real human interaction with the ordeal of the characters. That was very powerful.Juno temple really took my breath away with her performance as the mother of Sam. The moment she realizes she has to hand over custody of her own son, who she is hurting by being her incomplete self, the raw feeling of both courage and a cop-out, with all the inner turmoil knowing your kid is going to choose someone else over you, and you agree with that... I can't put into words what that does to me as a father, if I would be in that circumstance it would kill me, it would rip my heart out. And it is such a powerful moment.Not a moment you feel pressured in taking sides, on the contrary. I oftentimes felt quartered by my constantly shifting loyalty between the different protagonists in this movie, and the struggles they went through. Justin Timberlake is a great actor, Ryder Allen is marvelous and does such a great job at being both vulnerable and unwaveringly true to himself and the chemistry between the two is so well captured, I can go on and on. There are definitely some classical all American standards that might put you off in any other film, but in this it is the string of pearls of real moments and real emotions that hold the movie together and overshadow any shortcomings in the peripheral story lines. Go watch the movie. Well worth the investment, mainly the emotional kind.",Palmer

Life isn't perfect. Nothing is perfect. But I am giving this movie 10 out of 10 because its the most emotion I have felt watching a movie (without feeling manipulated) for quite a while. The thing you think will be the big crux of the movie - turns out to be just a few points along the arc of the film. Sure its all a bit unrealistic but who cares? We want to believe in it. We want it to do what it does. We need it to do what it does. Life can be real. We need movies to take us to the precipice of the unreal - and then make us believe anyway. That's what good movies do.Justin Timberlake is great even though it takes us half the film to forget he's Timberlake. Doesn't matter. Eventually we forget. The kid... the kid... just perfection - and written perfectly too. It's impossible not to love him and care about him. We get it. He is the justification for everything Palmer, the man - and the movie, is and becomes.

The acting is superb even from the little kid who had a tough job acting like a ""girly"" boy. The relationship between Palmer and the boy is what made this movie great.

The kid is not bad to watch, for his portrayal. It's one of those stories that ""woke"" people will like for its "" progressive direction ( eyes roll), and others may see as an ""agenda"" film. Either way, it's not, as I said, groundbreaking, just more the idea that... the world will come around to embrace the boy ( no spoilers), eventually, even if at first they don't.I guess if one must spend a lot of time confined to their home due to the present world situation, it's an okay escape of two hours that will pass quickly, as you can see what is coming next. So watch and feel good that the world is so embracing (not) and that there is hope for us all to accept (not).Not the worst thing you will see, but probably not something you'll much remember in a day or so, but at least it's a break from superhero, action and teen flicks that streaming seems to be pumping out, showcasing so much of right now.

Acting by the lead actors is excellent and the story is not just heartwarming or just politically correct. This is a story about all the way acceptance - no questions, no doubts, no preaching about right and wrong!
I expected that at some point Palmer, being the supposedly macho character in the film, would sit the boy down and explain a couple of things to him. But no, he didn't! And this is precisely what is great about Palmer and about ""Palmer"" the film.

My favorite thing about it, is that it promotes total acceptance with out that feeling like it was trying to ""teach you a lesson."" It just shows how people can (and SHOULD) be with people who are unlike themselves. WAY too many other movies would have shown the Palmer character being a total jerk and trying to change Sam - only to ultimately accept him the way he is at the end. Instead, Palmer seemingly accepts all of Sam's differences up front, even though he obviously can't understand any of it. I find that to be SO BEAUTIFUL!!! The acting was incredible and top notch all the way around. The only issue I had was with the editing... It felt very choppy, especially at the beginning of the movie.

154,docbates21,If You Are a Fan of Sling Blade...,7,4 February 2021,"This movie is the story of an ex-con who, upon his release from prison, befriends a young child that comes from a very troubled home life. A story whose premise is very akin to the movie Sling Blade. It's not nearly as good, however, nor is it going to win any Academy Awards, but it is heartwarming and a good watch the first time through. I have seen Sling Blade more times than I can remember; Palmer might get watched again if my girlfriend wants to see it, and there's nothing else on to watch.
JT is good. Alisha Wainwright is exceptional. The rest of the cast does their job, but no performances that were all that noteworthy. The writing and directing are pretty decent. Two things that I liked about it - and this is just me - was that every scene was well lit, and the camera work was solid. To me, those are two things you rarely ever notice if they are done well, but can absolutely ruin a movie if they're not.
The ending is relatively predictable.
The writers could have convaluted the process by making a whole bunch of legal obstacles for JT to go through at the end of this film. In real life, that probably would have been more accurate and realistic, but for the sake of this movie, they kept things pretty simple. I was glad that this was the route they chose to go as it kept a movie that was an hour and fifty-five minutes long from turning into a three hour snoozefest.

When the world has it in for you, God shows up through others. Sure King David did some terrible things, but in spite of that -- God still called King David a man after His own heart. Today, there is war waged against men and boys, and we as men need to protect those men and boys that cannot protect themselves, no matter what. Men, we must mentor boys to become strong men, and this should be coming from us--not women; this is our turf.
This film has heart--and lots of it. This is really, to me, the best Apple Originals has come out with. If you are going to make an Original, make it with heart and balls--not just push virtues, just too push them. There is a lot to unpack in this film, but I don't need to spoil anything for anyone. So, I just wanted to present my initial reaction to this film. I don't care what anybody says, I give it 10 stars. Done.",Palmer

168,DianaMEP,"Enjoyable Film, Extremely Well Acted",8,3 April 2021,"I wasn't sure what to expect from Palmer. It was a quiet, simple movie, a slower-paced film I was afraid would tweak us at the end and make us feel down. But this was not the case.Timberlake and the rest of the cast gave solid, skilled performances. There was nothing wooden or fake about any of the characters, all of whom were believable. They seemed like genuine small, town southern folks to me. I actually got lost in this story. That's always a good sign the acting wasn't ""showing.""
My guess is Ryder Allen is on the precipice of becoming this decade's Abigail Breslin. He was quite young and this was his first film. We haven't seen the last of this very talented young man.This was well worth watching and that I'll watch it again.",Palmer

170,AmeenKi,OK...,5,30 January 2021,This movie is literally just a day to day of an excon that just got out of prison there wasn't much happing throughout the film except the last 30 minutes or so that it isn't even considered as a slow burner but i liked the relationship between palmer and the little boy and how it developed and the acting was also okey and i wasn't really bored especially in the last 30 minutes so overall it isn't a great movie it's just an ok movie,Palmer

176,jlwarmington,Easy watch better than it looked on the trailer,7,29 January 2021,"First off yes its Justin being serious which is definitely not his strong suit, his movies are usually hit and miss. There were some cliche moments but I thought this movie was actually OK. I thought from the trailer it looked a bit dull, cliche and Justin trying to be dramatic and it was going to be a cheap TV movie like film. But it had a good look to it, great acting and the kid in the film is the star for sure. Worth a watch just for him, a natural.
The story is a little too slow and takes too long for anything to really grab you or make you feel emotional. I think its obvious that an actor with better dramatic acting chops would probably have been able to do more with it or perhaps they should have tailored the film to fit Justins strengths. The character didn't even really have any issues himself to overcome other than his old fashioned masculinity ideals. The character needed more of a struggle the kid needed to help him in return, revitalise this guy who had just come out of prison and trying to adjust to modern life. There was just something missing in the film but great actors involved and Justin tries his best.",Palmer

I cannot say I am a great fan of his music but he always portrayed a talent for it. But now we see another string to his bow in his sombre portrayal of Palmer in this cleverly scripted and directed biopic of life in rural Louisiana.
Almost stealing the show is Ryder Allen as the confused kid who promises to be another star of the future. A great watch.",Palmer
183,paisleycarol,Good movie.,8,6 May 2021,I watched this movie last night with my daughter. We both really liked it . Justin Timberlake (who plays a typical bloke )is a really good actor and the little boy (Ryder Allen) was so cute and played his part so well. I would say it is more of a chick flick but some males would probably like it too.,Palmer
184,deesirius,Cliché heartwarming story,7,30 October 2021,I like a good second chance movie. This honestly wasnt bad. Definitely shed some tears. Cared for all characters involved and was especially invested in the little boy and Palmer. Was good for an apple tv production. Very very sweet.,Palmer
185,markaswall,Slow Burning Movie led by an outstanding Justin Timberlake,7,7 February 2021,"You got all the components of a coming of age movie. Recently returning from prison, a former hometown hero played by Justin Timberlake, falls in love with a local woman while also trying to learn about and raise a boy with whom he has been trusted to raise.Released during a time of unrest with regards to LGBTQ rights and the rights of minorities across the US, Palmer is the story about how not to judge someone based on their looks or how to not judge a book based upon its cover.Justin Timberlake gives the best performance of his thus far short lived acting career. His performance is quite believable and JT makes himself quite vulnerable throughout giving us a side of him the public has never seen before. The acting along with a heartfelt performance by the surrounding casts propels this movie up. It is well worth the two hours you'll spend watching it on Apple TV.",Palmer

His facial expressions in my opinion, definitely made me feel what he was feeling especially when it came to Sam. Perfect movie for those who can't or I should say won't allow themselves to accept people for who they are. That way of thinking needs to go. That cycle needs to end . Palmer was a little sketched out at first but before one knew it, Palmer had a whole new way of seeing as well as accepting it. The little kid who played Sam was amazing !!!

His progression from someone confused by a little boy's unique being and trying to find his new place in the small town he grew up in to an open, loving man was exciting to watch.

197,chicagoray-32216,Not a movie you will watch more than once.,3,2 February 2021,"Pros:
Decent acting
Cons:
Slow moving and predictable.The movie is about a man released from prison early, convicted of attempted murder among other things. Staying with his relative and a neighbor boy she is watching. The boy is extremely effeminate and while Justin's character at first seems really taken aback by this he quickly grows to encourage and empower the boy. Once this part in the movie comes around you will quickly realize what is going to happen next, there isn't any twist or surprises. At the end you will either love it for the message or just be bored of it. It lacks suspense or action, it is just a really slow movie with not a lot of dialogue.",Palmer

But Timberlake does a fine job, here. Alisha Wainwright as Maggie provided a wonderful supporting role, too (and is she related to Alisha Keys?!!? She looks so alike her).But the standout performance for me came from Ryder Allen as Sam. Just amazing. Hopefully we'll see more from this talented young man in the future.I thoroughly recommend Palmer.",Palmer

Magnificent acting!,9,31 January 2021,"I must say this was one of the best performance from Justin timberlake. The subtlety of the story will guide you smoothly throughout the movies, the punchlines were well crafted. Once you are hooked to the story, you will feel the depth of each turnaround wholeheartedly. It's about friendship, second chance, self reflection. Amidst of turbulent social landscapes of across the globe, this film talks about courage and terraforming someone's inner most core. If you are up for a subtle philosophical treat accompanied by brilliant acting, i urge you to delve into this movie. Thanks!",Palmer

205,tonybertocchi,"Quite a good watch, worth the while.",8,31 January 2021,"It's servicable, southern tale with a bunch of somewhat predicatable touchstones; class conflict, redemption, debts carried for past sins, etc. What's refreshing is there's also a good parable about LGBTQ inclusion and acceptance. This theme ends end extending to the larger frame of the narrative, as Palmer slowly comes to terms with himslef. Timberlake very wisely underplays his role, and comes off very well. We totally invest in his slow transition; he's quite watchable, and makes the whole thing work well. Juno Temple - as ever - is totally fascinating even as the cliche'ed character she's playing, even if she only gets bout 10 minutes creen time in the whole thing.",Palmer

213,rossjayp,Predictable and not entertaining,1,13 February 2021,"Follows the formula that most white people are variations of bad, with the cops being the worst. The only good people are the excon (Timberlake), the LGBTQ young boy, and the teacher and janitor that happen to be black. The acting is decent throughout but the actors are held back by the terrible script and all of the contrived situations. The plots seems like it was following a lifetime channel checklist for a sappy story. A southern setting? Check. Excon who has a big heart and just made a mistake when he was young? Check. A trailer trash meth addict mom? Check. Intolerant cops, church goers, and employers? Check. Incompetent social workers? Check.This movie fails to impress.

Whatever the critics have to say, and whatever technicalities were not OK, this movie was gold. A movie is supposed to drag you in and make you feel like you are in that story. And this movie did exactly that. The story showed the beauty of this world in an unjust, cruel environment, and that, ultimately, the human spirit and love always prevails. It is one of the examples why humanity needs to live on, be kind, love and care for one another. Any time you have free just watch it. A movie is supposed to fill you with emotions, and this movie does that perfectly. Didn't expect it all, but suddenly a Saturday night's chilling session turned into a whole another experience.

I've not often been sympathetic to the plight of convicted criminals out on parole, but this opened my eyes as to why they have such a hard time not going right back to a life of crime. Justin Timberlake did an excellent job and so did the little boy. It is a simple move; but it's really a great film and one that I'm going to recommend to other people. I'm my opinion this is what movies should be like. I would have liked to see him end up with the teacher as his new mom, but maybe that was too predictable. I would have also liked to know that they have a good home to live in. I was hoping the church would have done the right thing and sign the house over to Palmer so that he could raise the little boy. Churches should do more to help families like this in need. Other than then ending being too short, I think this is close to a perfect film.",Palmer

In many ways, it is Manchester By The Sea set in the South, so do keep some tissues handy.Apple TV+'s catalogue may be small, but I think I will keep my future subscription regardless.

I love JT but I thought his character was a bit laboured for him. He was good but not great.
I liked this movie because it wasn't full of the usual US movie drivel that you have to sit through constantly. Ex-crim looking after a child - of course, CPS and concerned citizens expected but it played such a little part.
Ex-crim getting pushed to the limit - of course, testing his resolve and tempting him to recommit, but again it played such a little part.
Thank God these producers didnt follow the same boring, overused story lines. Made it a pleasure to watch.",Palmer
250,knights69,Great movie - is there nothing JT cant do and a new rising star,9,27 February 2021,"Let me start by saying this is not the type of movie I would normally watch but based on the trailer decided to give it a crack and very happy that I did, In my opinion Justin Timberlake's career is like Childish Gambino/Donald Glover i.e. is there nothing they can't do very well, and this movie is no exception. JT is great, the supporting cast is good including Juno Temple who doesn't have a huge roll but is pivotal (and an English actor to boot), Alisha Wainwright is great as Maggie, but the total scene stealer is Sam (Ryder Allen) , this kid absolutely nailed it raises the bar for those that have come before and those that come after.
If he continues this career I think will be someone to watch in the future.",Palmer
251,ref_hater,"Slow, sad, waste of time",5,1 February 2021,"I did not enjoy this movie. The plot was slow developing, the storyline was weak and frustrating. Don't waste your time watching this movie.",Palmer

256,valerybear-10526,"Yes predictable, but great acting and a wonderful new young actor",8,19 February 2021,My opinion of Justin Timberlake went up 1000% with this movie. His acting was fantastic. The story was basic and predictable but well told. The boy who played Sam was perfectly cast and melts your heart. I enjoyed the movie and appreciated the meaningful nature of the story in all of its elements.,Palmer
257,yasserdgt,I Love Sam,8,1 February 2021,"I never imagine that I will cry ... really I cried with Palmer and Sam, Sam was uncovering all defects in our society where I had been grown., our culture even not allowed a man to cry..!!!

It was generally formulaic, hit a lot of the same keys movies like this tend to but I don't think that's bad. It's a good, tugs at your heartstrings kind of movie and an overall satisfying watch",Palmer

267,millsonreels,Exceeded My Expectations,8,3 February 2021,"The last time I saw Justin Timberlake was back in In Time and the progress he's made in his acting journey is apparent here. He became Palmer to me in this film and was very believable. The story deals with a number of current relevant issues, chief among them are the challenges an ex-convict faces in returning to normal life and the challenges that families face when trying to raise and LGBTQ+ child.The film is well directed and well acted. Upon reflection there are a few times where I believe a more seasoned actor could have done a better job than JT, however, that is just a nitpick. I was absorbed into the story and needed to know the outcome from very early on.",Palmer
268,sarahmoughal,Great movie,10,4 February 2021,This movie is so good. It worth ever minute of watching .,Palmer

270,albertojh,Hmmmm,7,16 February 2021,We spent the first part of the film waiting for some thing to 'happen'. It was a steady movie but Somewhat strange in places. Overall very good.,Palmer
271,tiffanyktp,Loved!!!!!,10,14 February 2021,"There aren't too many movies who attempt this, and from the view of a grade school child makes this more brave to me. As we know kids can be mean, and to think there were/are people going through this important discovery without the support of people who give a damn is heartbreaking. I hope this opens the eyes for people who care to judge others journeys.",Palmer
272,vernon-khuzwayo,A great movie with amazing performances,10,6 March 2021,"I absolutely enjoyed the movie. The story was amazing. The performances from Justin and that little guy had me in tears,i imagine I felt some way because I am a parent too.
Justin has been away for a bit but he came back with movie and delivered amazing an performance.
Watch the movie for yourself to know.Great movie.. A 10 for me",Palmer
273,osama-b-a,I've seen better,3,8 May 2021,"It's similar to a movie called ""Gifted (2017)"" but it's not as good as ""Gifted (2017)""",Palmer
274,scottsantamaria,Fantastic Film.,9,15 February 2021,"Acting, stellar. Story, heart-felt and wonderful. This film is well worth watching and deserves higher ratings than what it has.",Palmer
275,brenwarren,Timberlake can act and don't heed the metascore/critics,7,30 January 2021,"Although official critics seemed generally (and I feel absurdly) rate the movie down, Indiewire gives a higher rating and the most accurate review by far.
Timberlake is fab to watch... and contrary to what some of the critics say, he's a very strong central character. I'm not an ex con but can completely see how you might feel very protective of a character like Sam. The acting from all the characters is very involving and believable. The plot is short, and perhaps a little too simple... and unfortunately not so realistic... and actually, although some say it was predictable , it's perhaps easy to say that after the fact. I couldn't help feeling very relieved it finished the way it did! Had it gone another way (which was just as likely ) it would have been a sad movie. As it was it was a great relief. Yet again , the critics are out of touch with what actually makes a film enjoyable/ entertaining. The same people rate Taxi Driver or Jackie Brown so highly, yet neither will stir emotions and inevitably end up boring. Sure the acting and filming is quirky, and the stories are lovely and complex. But are they really that entertaining? It's just high art... which I love by the way, but it's got to entertain too. Pulp Fiction for example - high art AND very entertaining.",Palmer
276,aheshm,Palmer! Palmer!,9,4 February 2021,Very very good. Great acting performance from Justin Timberlake.,Palmer

It's been months since I've seen a film so powerful, so fine, so right.

I think this is a great movie especially these days for kids who cannot stand up for themselves and for people being judged by their past. Love know no boundaries as they say.Justin did a really great job on showing what a wounded soul should be and Ryder is an amazing happy kid trapped in very dark environment. The connection of these two amazing actors was astounding. Halfway through the movie it feels like I'm watching someone else's reality tv.I wish this will have a part 2 someday. Applause to the actors, production and crew.",Palmer

316,sntdmbjj,Human redemption and capacity for love,10,1 February 2021,"In my opinion, this movie is a magnificent work or art! One of the best movies I have ever seen. Justin Timberlake plays this role with all of his soul and heart and you can really feel him and his dedication to it. Ryder Allen is incredible and a very promising actor. The story has so much humanity and love - you can really feel human suffering and how our capacity to love can help us on the path to redemption. It's our most valuable emotion "" - where there is love, there is life and where there is love there is light.""
I loved the one detail that shows a religious women having no compassion and being really mean - religion is no guarantee that you are a good person. Going to church doesn't make you a good person. Having a heart does. There's a lot of confusion in the world about this and some politicians misuse religion and hold bibles to demonstrate that they are on the ""right"" side. Guess what? Being on the right side is acting with love and compassion towards ALL human beings. And this movie shows exactly that.
We divide people in the name of caste, class, nationality, politics, gender, race and religion. We begin to put one caste, class, nationality, politics, gender, race or religion above other. We turn human diversity into human division. Such division leads to competition, conflict and war. We devise our politics in the interest of one group rather than another.
Watch this movie, feel it with your heart and instead of division practice inclusion. You will see how much better you will feel as a human being.",Palmer
317,arnehhalvorsen,What An Onion!,10,2 February 2021,"Yes. An onion. Why? Because like when using an onion I did get a little itchy in the eyeballs a few times... Also like an onion in that there are many layers to this well thought out, brilliantly written, outstandingly cast and directed movie. The perfect flavor of small town America, of redemption, forgiveness, about four different kinds of love and above all the trans-formative journey of a man who finally realizes what matters in this world and sets out to realize it for himself and those he cares about. A movie this good comes along maybe once a decade.",Palmer

319,susancwilson-78199,Not gender-confused,9,5 February 2021,"As a public school teacher for 30 years, I strongly object to the use of the term ""gender-confused"" for the boy Sam in this film. Unlike almost every adult in the movie, Sam is not confused, but is very clear about who he is and what he likes (dolls, princesses, tea parties). He is comfortable is his own skin. Can we not slap a negative label on him and just call him a sweet, well-adjusted child who just doesn't happen to conform to stereotypical male traits? Thank goodness to have less testosterone in this world!!",Palmer
320,livmitch,A story that's not told enough,8,6 February 2021,"As many reviewers have said ""this movie has been made so many times before"", but I'm not sure that's completely true. Palmer was such a lovely film. JT shows a side of him we haven't seen before. He experiences the progression of feelings realising his neighbour's son is struggling with gender identification, emotional and possibly physical abuse, and moving into his grandmas home. Even though, Palmer had been locked away for the past 12 years for a crime he took the fall for, never knew his mother and lost his father in his teens, he shows nothing but compassion for Sam. Sam deserves love as any other child does and Palmer knows that. He also wants to make sure that Sam knows that all people aren't as accepting but when Sam decides he doesn't care Palmer is there 100% to support him. The bond the two of them have is beautiful and give them both so much credit. This is exactly what we need, a bright relationship in this horrible time.",Palmer

I'd recommend it to anyone that has an open mind. Bonus points to JT for playing a character so remarkably different than himself. It resonates for people especially from smaller towns or who have dealt with bullying growing up. I personally loved it, but I'd give it a solid 6 out of 10 in the grand spectrum of movies (and that's just fine).",Palmer

342,daveshula-429-135683,innocence of a child that knows no hurtfulness,10,22 April 2021,"Fine acting and really pulls at your heart to see such a sweet innocent child that just wants to be.. nothing else.. to love the things he loves because he loves them.. no agenda, . Because he loves them. Bullies are bullies and never think how their action can crush the spirit and damage the soul of a child. It lasts for life. Palmer learns this and finds his heart being pulled by the innocence, forced to act. Great Movie and gives your soul something to reflect on.",Palmer

362,dominguezrsteven,JT brought it with his music! Watch him bring it with his acting!!,10,31 January 2021,"I normally don't judge book by it's cover but when I saw the trailer I thought it looks moving but JT doing a serious role? Ehh it might be ok. Like aged fine wine, his acting has cemented his skills with this film. This movie was so well written. The characters perfectly fit and the soundtrack tugging at your heart strings bleeding through each amazing scene just screamed perfection. Justin Timberlakes scene at the court brought me to tears. It was as perfect as Robin Williams Mrs Doubtfire court scene talking about his kids being his air to breathe. Do me a favor and watch this film. And give it a great review. I would LOVE LOVE to get this film recognized and for JT to win an Oscar for this amazing performance I for sure did not see coming.",Palmer

367,losheroff,Warms your heart,10,30 January 2021,"Surprised this isn't rated higher than a 7! The character development was amazing and the relationship between Palmer and Sam was believable, honest and beautiful. This was a feel good story at a time when we need it most and it's about time a movie portrayed a boy like Sam. We could all learn something from him and the tolerance Palmer shows him. Great story, also really liked the teacher, Ms. Maggie. All around great dramatic acting.",Palmer

372,amon91,Surprised me!,7,28 June 2021,"I didn't have a lot of expectations going in but I got to say that the movie surprised me by a long margin. Honestly, you get the idea of what this is going to turn out after watching the first few minutes, so I can say it's predictable to an extent. What made me so happy watching this is the way this handled such a crucial issue with our society. Great performance by JT and a super awesome performance by the little man! Actually everyone played their role wonderfully. Touching story, beautiful to say the least. Worth a watch!",Palmer
