0,TheLittleSongbird,A not so happy Halloween season,4,14 January 2018,"John Carpenter's 1978 'Halloween' is wholly deserving of its status as a horror classic. To this day it's still one of the freakiest films personally seen and introduced the world to one of horror's most iconic villainous characters Michael Myers.Which is why it is such a shame that not only are all of the sequels nowhere near as good but that the decline in quality is so drastic. Ok, the original 'Halloween' is very difficult to follow on from, but most of the sequels could at least looked like effort was made into them. 'Halloween III: Season of the Witch' had a generally negative critical reception and is still considered by many one of the worst of the series, but has garnered fans overtime. To me, 'Halloween III: Season of the Witch' is not that awful, but it is not a particularly good film either.It is often criticised for straying too far from the formula and not feeling at all like a 'Halloween' film. Actually these complaints are understandable, but a lot of people have also argued that there is much more wrong than just being unrecognisable as a 'Halloween' film. Actually, didn't mind at all that it tried to be different rather than being a retread like 'Halloween II' was, sadly it just didn't work out. Judging it as a standalone, 'Halloween III' also manages still to be problematic.'Halloween III' is not a complete mess. It is one of the better-looking and more polished sequels and has a suitably eerie look. The music has a spine-chilling atmosphere and has a real eeriness. The song is similarly very catchy.A couple of the deaths are disturbing and Dan O'Herlihy tries his best.Like the previous film, the drawbacks are numerous and significant. There is more creepiness than with 'Halloween II', even if just sporadically, but tonally it still doesn't feel right. The weirdness of the story is overkill and parts are unintentionally funny. The science fiction elements feature excessively and confuse the storytelling, as well as because it is more silly than eerie it dumbs it down.Once again there is very little scary or suspenseful. A couple of the deaths are more disturbing but most are not that creative or unsettling. The story was a decent idea that could have been creepy but was instead silly and with even more stupidity and illogic than the previous sequel. Many have said that no awards will be given for good dialogue and acting. That's putting it lightly. The script is clunky and cheesy ineptitude throughout and the acting, Dan O'Herlihy excepted, is pretty awful and fails to do anything with such dull and annoying characters. The gore is gratuitous, the ending is a big head-scratcher and the non-horror scenes are ineptly directed (in a film where direction reeked of inexperience), written and acted.In summation, mediocre and not so happy. Not quite as bad as reputed though. 4/10 Bethany Cox",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
1,Leofwine_draca,Most original of the many Halloween sequels,9,25 July 2016,"As far as the HALLOWEEN sequels go, this is the best of the bunch. It's an aborted attempt to make a series of films based around Halloween but each with a different storyline - unfortunately the slasher-hungry audience wanted more of Michael Myers and the films have been carbon-copies ever since. Based on an idea by QUATERMASS man Nigel Kneale, this film kicks off with a chase scene where a man is pursued by an emotionless assassin - think Michael Myers without the mask and you'll be right. What I noticed first about this film are the references to the previous HALLOWEEN films with the killers lurking about and stalking their victims in silence - definitely a variation on our favourite shape. They even throw in a few clips of the original HALLOWEEN just to drive the point home! After a show-stopping opening which has a hospital patient get murdered and the assassin's car blow up, a string of gory deaths provide the horror in the first half of the film. Otherwise, it's strictly procedural investigation as our heroic doctor, played by Tom Atkins, discovers a horrible plot to kill children on Halloween. The gore consists of various murders involving heads being crushed and mutilated - although in one sickening scene we see a female victim get silenced with a drill. Atkins, who also showed up in MANIAC COP, is actually pretty good as the film's lead, providing charisma and screen presence. Okay, so he's not the screen's most intelligent or exciting hero, but a solid one nonetheless. And with a supporting actress like Stacey Nelkin for company, you're bound to look good.After Atkins is kidnapped by sinister toy maker Conal Cochran (the film's racist slant makes the Irish responsible for all the chaos) things take a decidedly offbeat tone. Cochran's workforce of guards and scientists turn out to be an army of human robots powered by simple clockwork devices which keep them moving - their bodies filled with a yellow gel as a blood substitute. Atkins escapes, kills a few androids and turns the tables on his kidnappers, destroying them with their own weapon. But after this his job is still not yet done, as he must find a way to stop the evil television advert being broadcast in a good tension-filled climax.There is one exceptionally horrific moment in this film. It has a young boy watching a Halloween broadcast. The announcer tells him to don his special mask, which he does. A pumpkin flashes repeatedly on the screen, somehow connecting with a magic implant in the back of the mask. The boy collapses, and his head turns into a nest of cockroaches, beetles and snakes. This is a gruesome, disturbing scene, very well done although the bit with the woman in bed was even more disturbing for me. The 'spooky' advert which plays on televisions through the film has a twee song attached to it, which I found to be quite effective in a chilling kind of way. And it's quite clever how the bad guy uses the apparently innocent guise of kiddie consumerism as a cover for his massacre. Although HALLOWEEN III looks like it consists of three different films having been mixed together, it's still a highly enjoyable affair and worth a watch as something different.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
2,SnoopyStyle,Workable stand alone movie,6,23 October 2013,"Dr Daniel Challis (Tom Atkins) is on call in the hospital. An old man was on the run is being treated there. Someone comes in to kill him in a murder-suicide. His daughter Ellie Grimbridge (Stacey Nelkin) wants to solve his murder leading her and Dr Challis to a small town of Santa Mira where halloween masks are made. It is a company town run by company president Cochran (Dan O'Herlihy).First off there is no Michael Myers. They kept a few notes from the franchise and they actually had a commercial for Halloween on the TV in the bar. But this is a stand alone effort like a Twilight Zone episode. Apparently that was the original intent of the franchise but it was very poorly received. People expect and want Michael Myers. As a stand alone effort, it has its charm.Tom Atkins is not a big name actor. He's more a workman actor, and he's solid here in this movie. The premise is pretty interesting but it can't really pass a tough examination. Some of it isn't logical at all. There are some really cool stuff happening here. Some are very memorable like the bugs. If it didn't get tangle up with all the Halloween stuff, it'd probably be better received.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
3,Sleepin_Dragon,It doesn't deserve its name.,2,2 November 2018,"Do I really need to say anything else then 'I hate this terrible movie,' everything that was great about one, and good about two has been removed. It looks and feels cheap, and tacky, the first one is so slick, well made, and well filmed, this one looks like a cheap 80's b horror movie, the acting is wooden. You can forgive those elements in a horror film if it has a unique factor, something striking, but no, they've even taken Michael Myers out, result, this isn't Halloween. The plot is thinner then a gnat's shoelace, and it just is truly a sad watch. Every sequel and prequel was superior, even the dreaded Halloween 4 is world's ahead.It makes no sense, it's stupid. Awful movie. 2/10",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
4,gavin6942,A Different Direction,6,3 August 2015,"A large Halloween mask-making company has plans to kill millions of American children with something sinister hidden in Halloween masks.As I understand it, this film took a beating at the time because it dared to take the ""Halloween"" franchise in a different direction. Looking back now (2015), it seems to be remembered more favorably because the detour is not a shock to today's viewers (even if it confuses them that one out of ten movies has nothing to do with Michael Myers). Personally, I wish it had continued down this path... a new story every two years? Could have been big and a great gateway for Carpenter's friends.Tom Atkins is a joy to watch (and a pleasant man in real life). Having him be a part of the Carpenter extended family is great, and even though civilians may recall him best for ""Lethal Weapon"", he will always be a horror treasure.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
5,lee_eisenberg,"An interesting story, although there was no reason to associate it with the ""Halloween"" franchise.",7,11 February 2006,"First of all, I should identify that Michael Myers does NOT appear in this movie; there's not even any mention of him (except for a scene where they watch the original ""Halloween""). ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" portrays a toy company making a costume with a deadly secret. What's interesting about this movie is really that it's more than just a who's-gonna-get-slaughtered-next story. I didn't recognize any of the people in it - although apparently, Jamie Lee Curtis's voice is used. All in all, one might interpret this movie as a warning against the dangers of excessive holiday commercialism. So are you ready to go out and buy any more toys?",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
6,jboothmillard,Halloween III: Season of the Witch,1,2 November 2009,"When you're making a sequel to a great film, or as part of a series, and you completely eliminate the original feel or premise, specifically getting rid of a key character and famous killer like Michael Myers, it's pretty obvious you're going to have a stinker, from director Tommy Lee Wallace (Fright Night Part 2). Basically the Silver Shamrock Corporation is advertising and producing heavily their stock of Halloween masks for kids, and the head of the company Conal Cochran (Dan O'Herlihy) is planning something evil. He has implanted all new masks with computer chips, containing small pieces of a boulder from Stonehenge, and through an ancient Celtic ritual these masks will kill anyone who wears them. Dr. Dan Challis (Lethal Weapon's Tom Atkins) is the man investigating the strange incidents and assumed murders going on, and comes across this sinister scheme, and he must stop both Cochran and the advertising before the clock strikes midnight for Halloween. Also starring Stacey Nelkin as Ellie Grimbridge, Ralph Strait as Buddy Kupfer, Michael Currie as Rafferty, Jadeen Barbor as Betty Kupfer, Bradley 'Brad' Schacter as 'Little' Buddy Kupfer Jr., Garn Stephens as Marge Guttman, Halloween's Nancy Kyes (or Loomis) as Linda Challis, Jonathan 'Jon' Terry as Starker and Al Berry as Harry Grimbridge. The only very, very mildly entertaining moment was one of the villain's robot-like henchmen pulling a man's head off and it spurting blood, oh, and ironically, the original film is mentioned as a TV trailer. I didn't realise that the filmmakers had planned a new kind of series, where each film would be a different horror story on Halloween night, this being the first, but they brought Michael Myers back when this failed, thank god they did (not that it made any difference to the quality of the films). The critics got this third entry absolutely right, it is an original story, but not in the good way, it isn't scary, it isn't entertaining, it didn't have Michael Myers, it isn't something I'd want to see again, and where's the witch anyway? Definitely the worst of the series and a crap horror sequel. Poor!",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
7,Woodyanders,"An excellent, underrated, and unjustly maligned horror/sci-fi outing",8,24 September 2012,"Shrewd and ruthless master mask maker Conal Cochran (marvelously played with jolly sinister aplomb by Dan O'Herlithy) devices an ingenious way to kill countless innocent children on Halloween. It's up to Dr. Daniel Challis (a fine and sympathetic performance by Tom Atkins) and pretty young Ellie (a sweet and appealing portrayal by the lovely Stacey Nelkin) to figure out a way to stop Cochran before it's too late. Writer/director Tommy Lee Wallace relates the gripping story at a steady pace, does an ace job of creating and sustaining a spooky mysterious atmosphere, and maintains a grim tone that stays bleakly true to itself right to the devastatingly downbeat and nihilistic end. Moreover, the diabolically clever premise combines horror and science fiction elements with tremendous startling imagination as the holiday's ghastly Celtic druid roots concerning mass virgin sacrifices are brought into contemporary times through the use of advanced modern technology. The filmmakers warrant extra praise not only for having the guts to kill a kid on screen in a truly sick and disturbing way, but also for providing several spot-on satirical potshots at capitalism and consumerism. The make-up f/x are quite grotesque and creative. Michael Currie contributes a hearty turn as folksy motel proprietor Rafferty, Nancy Kyes makes a brief appearance as Challis' bitter ex-wife Linda, and the engaging presence of Essx Smith as helpful gas station owner Walter Jones bookends the picture. Middle-aged alcoholic and womanizer Challis makes for a touchingly flawed average guy hero. Dean Cundey's sharp widescreen cinematography gives the movie an impressive polished look. The pulsating score by John Carpenter and Alan Howarth further enhances the overall ominous mood. Good creepy fun.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
8,Tweekums,No Michael Myers and it's not a 'slasher' but it's decent enough,6,25 October 2019,"This film may be part of the 'Halloween' franchise but there is no sign of Michael Myers; in fact it isn't even a slasher film. Instead we get a mystery with elements of sci-fi and supernatural horror. As the story opens Harry Grimbridge, is attacked; he escapes and is later taken to hospital. Here he states that everybody is going to die while clutching a Halloween mask. Shortly afterwards a man walks into the hospital and kills this man before immolating himself in the carpark. Ellie, the Harry's daughter, and his doctor, Daniel Challis set about investigating Harry's last days. He worked at a shop which sold Halloween masks, amongst other things, and the last known place he visited was Santa Mira; home of Silver Shamrock Novelties, the company that made the mask. It isn't long before Daniel and Ellie are convinced that there is something sinister going on there; but how it is linked to their popular masks and irritatingly catchy TV commercial remains to be discovered.If you are hoping for a typical 'Halloween' film than this will be a major disappointment; apart from its title and the fact that it is set at Halloween it has nothing in common with them. If you are happy to watch something trying to do something new it is fun enough. There are few real scares; to be honest I enjoyed it more as a mystery than as a horror film. There aren't too many deaths and much of the unpleasantness happens off camera... there is one scene where a man's head is pulled off and another which shows the effects of the mask when activated that might be considered moderately disturbing. I liked the reveal about the company workers; I didn't see it coming. I also enjoyed the explanation as to how the masks would work; an utterly bonkers mish-mash of sci-fi and the supernatural. The cast do a solid job given the material. Overall I certainly wouldn't call this a great film but it is pretty enjoyable overall... I just hope I can get the annoying jingle out of my head soon!",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
9,BA_Harrison,Must... stop... singing... that... blasted... jingle...,8,22 March 2009,"After the apparent demise of Michael Myers in Part 2, the makers of the Halloween series seized the opportunity to try something a little different with their next instalment: giving the population of Haddonfield a break from being slaughtered, Halloween III: Season of the Witch follows Dr. Daniel 'Dan' Challis (Tom Atkins) as he investigates the murder of one of his patients. Accompanied by the dead man's pretty daughter, Ellie Grimbridge (Stacey Nelkin), the doctor follow clues that lead him to the town of Santa Mira, where a druidic mask maker (aided by his army of superhuman androids) is planning to plunge the world into a new era of ancient religion and magic through the sacrifice of the thousands of children who have bought one of his deadly Silver Shamrock masks.With the only references to the original movie being a couple of clips of Carpenter's classic glimpsed on a television set, Halloween III is completely free to experiment with lots of new ideas that, although rather silly, are loads of fun and definitely a welcome breath of fresh air after the first two films (I love Parts 1 and 2, but the standard stalk and slash formula can soon become tiresome). Season of the Witch's goofy plot allows for a spot of iffy mysticism, some womanising from the good doctor (this being the 80s, he's even able to grab a female colleague's ass without fear of a law suitmust be the blow-waved hair and Magnum-style moustache that does the trick), a scathing attack on consumerism, a spot of reasonable gore, and one hell of a catchy jingle (which features in the Silver Shamrock adverts, and will never, ever leave your brain), all delivered with a delightfully camp approach that even allows for a touch of gratuitous child killing!Of course, there are some moments that don't make complete sensethe 6 o'clock curfew in Santa Mira is never explained, and the ending, which sees an Ellie android attacking Dan as he races against the clock to prevent disaster, is kinda dumbbut the movie's brisk pace, the excellent cinematography by Dean Cundey, the spooky synth score, and the fine performances (Atkins is, of course, über-cool , and Dan O'Herlihy makes a memorably chilling baddie) easily compensate for the film's less logical moments.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
10,Quinoa1984,About as watchable as seeing Sadaam Hussein under a strobe light,5,7 December 2000,"I don't know what John Carpenter and Debra Hill (producers of this film) were on while making this film (probably inspired by Dr. Dre likeness of smoking weed until you see little green dancing midgets), but this film su-huhuhuhuhuhuhu-cks. After watching the film I had an expression on my face like your dog does when you put him on the phone. The film is in no way at all connected to the original classic Halloween, and owes more to Invasion of the Body Snatchers as the story follows a plot to kill all the kids on Halloween. Oh just beautiful. The film gives a new name to bad horror films as it is in no way scary, no way chilling and at the very least is annoying. No wonder Carpenter left the series after this. Oh well. F",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
11,Coventry,"Silly, cheesy, messy...but really not THAT bad",5,19 December 2004,"Without legendary psycho Michael Myers or Dr. Sam Loomis appearing anywhere in this film, it turned out one of the biggest fiascos in the horror movie industry and perhaps the most hated movie among fans of the genre. All together, this is a pretty unrighteous reputation as ""Season of the Witch"" stands on its own as a rather solid movie, with a premise that leans much closer to the actual meaning of Halloween than an indestructible madman chasing his sister with a knife. With a marvelously wicked plot, coming from the versatile mind of Nigel Kneale who also wrote stories for films as ""Quatermass and the Pit"", this ""Season of Witch"" tells the tale of a devilish toymaker who developed the fiendish plan to kill all children on Halloween eve by making them wear gruesome masks that are in fact diabolical machines. Doctor Challis and the beautiful Ellie Grimbridge are the first ones who discover that there's something strange going on in the old toy-factory, led by the mysterious Mr. Cochran and start to investigate the matter ""Season of the Witch"" depends on a rather amusing magical atmosphere, taking the commercialized event that Halloween has become back to initial roots of witch cults and child sacrifices. Too bad that director Wallace optioned for villain Cochran to resemble an insane scientist rather than a Celtic sorcerer, which more or less ruins the 'evil'-aspect of his character. Near the end, the entire promising concept of this film regretfully changes into a messy 80's flick with silly twists and cheesy make-up effects. But even then it remains hugely enjoyable, also thanks to the above average acting performances by the immensely underrated Tom Atkins and Dan O'Herlihy. John Carpenter, who once started the profitable Halloween cycle, provides the movie with an eerie musical score and strict production values while the camera-work by Cundrey makes the film look better than it actually is. Even though hardly comparable, Season of the Witch ranks as the second best film in the Halloween series in my humble opinion. Yet, you better regard this as an independent horror production and make sure you don't start watching it before you got rid of all the typical prejudices.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
12,michaelRokeefe,Halloween is a night destined for disaster.,6,23 October 2001,"This is a non-sequel sequel among over half a dozen spawned from the original HALLOWEEN(78). With no connections to the first two films it is easy to bad mouth this project; but wait. Watch it a couple of times and you will have to agree the story line holds up on its own and does bring you certain amounts of intrigue, anxiety and pensive suspense. No returning characters or slasher to fear, but that does not mean we don't have a manic menace to deal with. A psychopathic, sadistic toy manufacturer(Dan O'Herlihy)plans to massacre millions of TV watching kiddies on Halloween night that are wearing his electronic controlled spook masks. The TV jingle used throughout gets quite annoying, but overall I think this is a pretty eerie and creepy movie. Come on try it again...you'll like it. I actually enjoy having a story line with its gory intent, instead of the randem slashing and stabbing this time.Also of note in the cast are: Stacy Nelkin, Michael Currie, Tom Atkins and Al Berry. I have always thought Mr. O'Herlihy had the makings of a nasty villain with a demented soul. Good or bad, he is usually pretty classy. I don't mind being in the minority of watchers that view this most Halloween nights.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
13,hitchcockthelegend,Conglomerate Carnage.,7,2 November 2014,"A different animal to the Halloween films that preceded and followed it, Season of the Witch is slowly but surely gaining an appreciation as a standalone horror film. Gone is Michael Myers' indestructible killing machine, in his place is the nefarious Conal Cochran (Dan O'Herlihy), the owner of the Silver Shamrock corporation that specialises in Halloween masks. Cochran has a sinister plan this year - and it's deadly - Dr. Daniel Challis (Tom Atkins) and Ellie Grimbridge (Stacey Nelkin) are caught in the middle of the vile plot and may just be the only salvation to Americana.With Nigel Kneale involved in the writing process Season of the Witch is delightfully fiendish. There's definite barbs being stung here about the commercialisation of holiday occasions, that capitalism kills, Cochran is intent on restoring Halloween to the true meaning of its origins, creating a Silver Shamrock world order in the process. Kneale would take his name off the credits when the studio tampered with his vision, a shame because his core essence remains - even if Cochran as a Warlock Wicker Man type could well have been genius.With John Carpenter and Debrah Hill over seeing things from their production chairs, the picture had supervision of some standing. Tommy Lee Wallace maybe directing but it feels like a Carpenter movie, from Dean Cundey's photography - Carpenter's foreboding synth musical score – and the sharpness of the gruey horror scenes (which are excellent), it's not hard to see the ""non Michael Myers"" Halloween series that Carpenter had envisaged after part 2 had been and gone.Boosted by an irritatingly potent advertisement jingle (a Silver Shamrock variation on London Bridge is Falling Down) that counts down the days to Halloween and the day of carnage, Season of the Witch is consistently gnawing away at the senses. Having Atkins and O'Herlihy propping up the acting helps, both are reliable performers for this material, while the race against time finale has edge of the seat credentials.It doesn't all work of course, there's some drag and the narrative feels schizophrenic at times, while if it wasn't for Cundey's camera work then Wallace's inept direction of the non horror scenes would be over exposed. Yet as it asks Halloween franchise fans some forgiveness for not actually being part of the franchise, it delivers a smart sci-fi horror hybrid that's not without shock and awe. 7/10",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
14,Theo Robertson,Not Really A Nigel Kneale Script,4,6 January 2005,"I knew the studio politics before I saw SEASON OF THE WITCH . That is I knew that the producers had decided to release a film every year under the Halloween banner that had absolutely zero to do with Michael Myers so there was no disappointment on my part that this wasn't a stalk and slash sequel . What disappointed me was the credits reading "" Written by Tommy Lee Wallace "" when I knew fine well who wrote the screenplay . However after seeing the movie I could see that Kneale's contribution had been diluted to death and that's why he wanted his name removed !!!!!!! MILD SPOILERS !!!!!!!! It's easy to see what parts of the plot belong firmly to Kneale , namely the central story of Stonehenge being used to destroy the children of America ( Similar to QUATERMASS ) and of a sinister factory being used for a covert invasion ( Similar to QUATERMASS 2 ) along with concepts welding the supernatural and science together . Unfortunately the rest of the script lacks Kneale's strength of painting strong characters and making memorable dialogue . Worse the script shows signs of being so written to death someone has forgotten to explain why the bad guy is planning to kill all the children on Halloween , or at least that's how it seems on first glance The producers deserve some credit on trying to do something different to a movie franchise , but it's obviously a failed experiment . If only they'd let Nigel Kneale do his own thing",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
15,Hey_Sweden,"Happy, happy Halloween, Silver Shamrock!",8,2 November 2013,"It's such a shame that this entry in the ""Halloween"" franchise isn't more appreciated. It DOES have its admirers (such as this viewer), but it just wasn't satisfying to an audience that only wanted Michael Myers. Certainly a franchise that revolved around different macabre stories told at Halloween time would have been more interesting than yet another ""psycho on a murder spree"" plot. Conceived by producer Debra Hill as a tale of witchcraft in the computer age, the idea was taken to noted writer Nigel Kneale, although his script would be re-written by producer John Carpenter and re-written again by debuting director / longtime Carpenter associate Tommy Lee Wallace.Legendary stud Mr. Tom Atkins stars as the commendably flawed protagonist Dr. Daniel Challis (he's insatiable and has a weakness for drink), who's thrown for a loop when a panicked man is brought to his hospital and murdered later that night by a cold-eyed, well dressed assassin. Hooking up with the victims' daughter Ellie (cute as a button Stacey Nelkin), he decides to play detective and tracks the mans' actions to a Halloween mask factory in a small California town. Presiding over the business and town is cheerful Conal Cochran (Dan O'Herlihy, whom you'll recognize from ""The Last Starfighter"" and ""RoboCop"" 1 and 2), a maniacal villain putting into motion a horrible prank that he intends to play on the children of America. It's up to Daniel to save the day...if he can keep his hands off of Ellie for long enough.As noted, this in-name-only sequel (the only nod it makes to past movies is a TV commercial for the '78 Carpenter-helmed ""Halloween"") owes a fair bit to ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", right down to naming the town Santa Mira. It's solidly entertaining and consistently amusing stuff, with Wallace (assisted by ace D.P. Dean Cundey) creating fine atmosphere, especially when it comes to the corporate-controlled town, where Cochrans' ""eyes and ears"" are everywhere. The film hits the ground running, and there's no let up right until the ending. Tom Burmans' makeup is excellent; there's good gross-out stuff here. Atkins is an appealing unlikely hero and Nelkin is pleasing to look at as the daughter who gets over the death of her father in record time. Supporting and bit parts are played by the likes of Michael Currie (""Dead & Buried""), Ralph Strait (""The Beastmaster""), Garn Stephens (the real-life Mrs. Tom Atkins at the time), Nancy Kyes (Annie in the first ""Halloween""), Jonathan Terry (""The Return of the Living Dead""), Maidie Norman (""What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?""), stunt coordinator Dick Warlock, and Joshua John Miller (""Near Dark""). Carpenters' score is one of his best. And to top it all off, there's that insidiously catchy jingle (sung to the tune of ""London Bridge is Falling Down"") that pops up over and over.If only it didn't have the name ""Halloween"" attached, some viewers might be more inclined to give it a break.Eight out of 10.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
16,Doylenf,Sci-Fi thriller capitalizes unfairly on other Carpenter films...,5,23 October 2006,"Part of the disappointment in HALLOWEEN III is that the title is a misnomer. It had audiences expecting Michael Meyers to make another slasher appearance rather than settle for a fairly straightforward sci-fi thriller borrowing heavily from the theme of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers."" This time, it's Halloween again and mysterious doings are investigated by TOM ATKINS (a doctor) and a young woman (STACEY NELKIN) whose father has been mysteriously murdered. Their investigation leads them to a factory for producing lethal Halloween masks as some sort of evil plot against children by corrupt DAN O'HERLIHY who runs the factory staffed by mechanical men designed to stalk and kill in brutal fashion.After a rather unexpected ending at the factory, there's still a further twist as the hero and heroine escape and their last scene is played in the car as they make their getaway. Without giving a plot development away, it's a chilling moment right out of something Rod Serling would write for ""The Twilight Zone"".The film has been mercilessly panned, but it's really not that bad as far as these sort of things go. The plot itself is ridiculous, yes, but it does manage to stir up enough suspense through some good performances by TOM ATKINS and DAN O'HERLIHY. However, the girl is strictly a liability as Atkins' love interest.Probably ranks among the weaker Halloween films but it's not a total loss.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
17,preppy-3,Gruesome and pointless,1,10 March 2009,"Pretty terrible horror film. It's about a large Halloween company making masks for kids that will do something terrible to them on Halloween night. Daniel Challis (Tom Atkins) and Ellie Grimbald (Stacey Nelkin) discover this and try to stop it.I caught this at a theatre back in 1982. I was able to deal with the fact that Michael Myers is not in this. I knew that before I saw it so I'm judging it on its own merit. As a stand alone horror film it basically sucked! The plot itself is pretty sick--unless you find the idea of tons of kids across America being killed amusing. There's also some needlessly gruesome killings which goes totally against the subtlety of the original ""Halloween""--but then again ""Halloween 2"" was pretty graphic also. There is some good acting by Nelkin and old pro Dan O'Herlihy (who must have been desperate for work) but Atkins is dull and wooden in the lead. Add to this an ending that leaves you hanging (my audience booed and threw things at the screen) and you have one BAD horror film. This film was a bomb at the box office (no surprise there) and stopped the Halloween series for a few years. Unfortunately it came back and gave us an increasing number of stupid sequels. Still even the sequels with Myers aren't as bad as this! A 1 all the way.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
18,poolandrews,"Name only addition to the Halloween series of horror films, it's a little silly but I actually kinda liked it.",6,18 December 2004,"After the opening title sequence of a pumpkin face being drawn on a monitor in extreme close-up which I thought was pretty cool looking and the filmmakers at least tried to do something original and a little bit different with the credits, we are informed via an on screen caption that we are in 'Northern California' and that it is 'October Saturday the 23rd'. Harry Grimbridge (Al Berry) is running along a deserted street, a car in hot pursuit. It starts to pour with rain and he seeks help and shelter at a gas station, the attendant Walter Jones (Essex Smith) takes him to the local hospital. Harry is seen to by Dr. Daniel Challis (Tom Atkins). A guy (Dick Warlock) in a smart suit walks into Harrys room and kills him. A nurse (Maidie Norman) screams, Challis runs after the guy who gets into his car douses himself in petrol and sets himself on fire. 'Sunday the 24th', the Sheriff (John MacBride) questions Harrys daughter Ellie (Stacy Nelkin) while Challis curiously looks on, unconvinced by the Sheriff's theories. 'Wednesday the 27th', Challis visits a friend at the coroners office named Teddy (Wendy Wessberg) and manages to convince her to do some digging around and see what she can come up with. Challis and Ellie decide to team up and try and find out what happened to Harry and who the assassin was. The only clue they have is the Silver Shamrock mask Harry was holding when he was admitted to the hospital and the day before he was supposed to pick up a delivery of them from the factory that makes them in the small town of Santa Mira. When they get there it's now 'Friday the 29th'. They use the story that their there to collect an order of masks, and book themselves into a local motel. While questioning a local man named Starker (Johnathan Terry as Jon Terry) Challis hears some strange rumours about the factory and the man who runs it, Conal Cochran (Dan O'Herlihy). 'Saturday the 30th', Challis and Ellie use a family from San Diego whom they have befriended, Buddy Kupfer (Ralph Strait) his wife Betty (Jadeen Barbor) and their young son Buddy Jr. (Brad Schacter as Bradley Schacter) who are there as personal guests of Cochran, to gain behind-the-scenes access to the factory. Ellie notices her fathers pick-up truck there and Challis sees lots of men in suits who look very similar to the one who murdered Harry. It soon becomes clear that there is a very sinister plan in motion that could threaten millions of lives on Halloween night and it's up to Ellie and Challis to escape Cochrans clutches who wants to shut them up, and warn the outside world! Written and directed by Tommy Lee Wallace I simply don't understand the venom aimed at this neat little film. So what if it doesn't have Micheal Myers in it? It didn't bother me in the slightest, even though technically he is in the film as while watching T.V. in a bar Challis sees an advert for the original Halloween (1978) which I thought was a nice touch. At least they tried to make an original and somewhat different film in the horror genre which many filmmakers don't, for that I believe this film deserves some credit. The script is sometimes a little silly, especially towards the end as things are revealed, and one or two things could have been expanded upon and explained a bit better. But it keeps moving along nicely and reveals it's plot bit by bit which kept me interested in watching it right through to the end. A special word of mention goes to the Silver Shamrock commercial which features one of the most annoyingly catchy and cheesy tunes I've ever heard! There is some decent gore here too, a man has his head ripped off, some has a drill inserted into their head and someone has their lips burnt off by a laser beam which then makes loads of insects appear and crawl over their face. Technically the film has a nice polish about it and looks good all round. Acting is OK and Atkins makes for a pretty likable hero, Nelkin as Ellie is attractive enough as Atkins love interest and O'Herlihy makes for a sinister villain. The first time I watched this film I was genuinely surprised by the original storyline and for that I must congratulate the filmmakers as it's not an easy thing to do when you've seen as many horror films as me. If your looking for something a little different in the horror genre than give it a go, just don't expect a dull slasher film. It probably wouldn't hold up to repeat viewings either as once you know the story it would lose it's effectiveness. It's not a perfect film, far from it in fact but I still liked it despite it's faults.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
19,utgard14,Extremely Underrated,8,9 February 2014,"Ellie Grimbridge (Stacey Nelkin) teams up with Dr. Dan Challis (Tom Atkins) to investigate the mysterious death of her father. Their investigation leads them to the Silver Shamrock novelty-making company, owned by Conal Cochran (Dan O'Herlihy). Silver Shamrock is selling Halloween masks and advertising a big giveaway on television on Halloween night. But what Cochran really has planned is much more sinister and bizarre.One of the most underrated movies on IMDb. The score is ridiculously wrong. The primary complaint many seem to have is just that it doesn't have Michael Myers in it. Who cares?!? I can see being upset when it first came out that it used the Halloween brand to sell the movie yet didn't have any connection with the rest of the series. But that doesn't have squat to do with objectively judging the film's quality. It's been over thirty years so why can't it be judged on its own merits and not for the flimsy reason that it says Halloween III and doesn't have Michael? Besides, most of the Halloween sequels that did have Michael sucked balls so it's not like this marred some perfect series or something. I understand that, besides the Myers complaints, it is not a flawless film. But it is good with an interesting plot, effective suspense, and some cool death scenes. If you're a John Carpenter fan, you should enjoy this as it has many of his touches all over it, including the great score. The cast is mixed, with Dan O'Herlihy doing a great job as the villain and Tom Atkins being a likable and somewhat cheesy Carpenter-style protagonist. Stacey Nelkin is cute but offers little to the film other than fleeting teases of nudity.If you hate this film because it doesn't feature Michael Myers, then I have no words for you because you're hopeless. But for those who are debating whether or not to try it out, please do so because this is infinitely more unique and interesting than another repetitive sequel about a guy stabbing people to death. Don't get me wrong -- I enjoy a lot of slashers, particularly from the '80s, for their entertainment value. They can be very good popcorn movies. But most of the genre is full of garbage rip-offs and retreads. This movie is at least original and clever.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

That is low standards, lady.Outside of that, it was a decent movie. The acting wasn't that great. Conal Cockran (Dan O'Herlihy) had about as much emotion as his bodyguards. The scheme was far-fetched, but sci-fi fans wouldn't mind.It had some good horror effects with the decapitation, and the misfiring button, and the final act in the factory.

21,Boba_Fett1138,"Not bad, just a bit silly perhaps.",6,8 September 2009,"In all honesty, this really isn't a bad genre movie, that still could had used a much better story though.This movie is only an Halloween-movie by name. It's story and characters have really nothing to do with the Michael Myers Halloween-franchise. Appearantly after ""Halloween II"" it was intended to continue the Halloween franchise by releasing new Halloween movies each year, each with a separate new horror story and characters in it. They abandoned this idea pretty fast again, after this movie proofed to be a failure at the box office and with the critics.But well really, as a stand-alone movie you really have to conclude that this isn't a very bad genre movie to watch. It has some decent horror elements in it, though the movie is perhaps being more of a mystery than an horror one really. The movie is maintaining enough to watch but it's also really far from a perfect one.The movie is being a bit silly with its story. Besides the story just isn't very mysterious or hard to figure. From pretty early on you already understand what is going on and to which climax the movie is heading to. Really, you don't have to be genius or into the genre to figure this all out. Had they spend some more time on the movie its story and originality the concept perhaps could had proved to be successful one and that way we would had been saved from all those Halloween sequels, featuring the immortal Michael Myers in it.The movie could had also done with some better characters in it. The main character, a divorced doctor and father who sleeps around with young woman, just isn't a very compelling one. Besides, Tom Atkins looks more like an '70's porn actor in this. Luckily the movie also still has Dan O'Herlihy in it, who is a nice main villain for the movie.Simply good and maintaining enough, as long as you don't expect a typical normal Halloween-movie entry.6/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
22,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,'tis the season,6,31 January 2010,"The obvious argument for why this is so unpopular is that people are just disappointed it didn't hold Michael Myers. To be fair, that probably is not the entire explanation. For those who don't know, this was what Carpenter and Hill intended; a series where every Halloween, another flick would hit cinemas, and they'd all be new ideas. They didn't want to bring back MM. Unfortunately, audiences seem to prefer something sub-par that they can recognize to anything they can't, as evidenced by the fact that after this, there were five sequels, and now Zombie's done a reboot and a follow-up to that, as well. No, this isn't perfect, and not entirely unique(to get the full experience of your first viewing of this, try not to find out what it's reminiscent of, and do not read the plot here on the site). However, for this being Lee Wallace's initial attempt at directing, he certainly does pretty good. I'm serious, if you give this a chance, you will find it has a quite effective mood and atmosphere, built up relatively well, and it is also genuinely creepy. This is more of a mystery than the two that precede it, and there isn't particularly chasing. It is scary and suspenseful, though. While I don't know how close to Nigel Kneale's script this stays, I understand that it doesn't deviate all that much. The concept is cool and eerie, the reveal is effective and surprising, and the opening credits sequence is well-done. Instead of the usual excessively good lead, this one has a flawed person, and moves away from teenagers being the focus. With that said, the characters aren't entirely credible, or all that well-developed. And the romance is not convincing or realistic. The acting isn't all that impressive, aside from Atkins himself, Nelkin and O'Herlihy. At least the kids aren't terribly irritating. That theme tune is, which is clearly on purpose. On that subject, the music is great(I think John is the one responsible for that). The FX are well-done with few exceptions. Dialog varies, as far as both writing and delivery go. This can be campy, and it definitely does not take itself too seriously, or pretend to be smarter than it is. It's distinctive(to a greater extent than the others in the franchise, other than the 1978 one), and the small town setting works well. No, it is not entirely original, and no, the final twist does not make sense or hold up to scrutiny, but it's *fun*. It actually is. And that is noteworthy, since you can't say that about all the movies that try to be entertaining. There is plenty of brutal, bloody and gory violence, frequent moderate to strong language, and brief, gratuitous nudity and sexuality in this. The DVD holds an interesting commentary track by a film critic and a horror expert and production details in text form. No subtitles. Maybe I got a specific one. I recommend this to fans of the genre. Do not go into this thinking it will be a continuation; if you need to, mentally erase that one word from the title. 6/10",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

While in the process of being quickly examined he is suddenly awakened by a Halloween commercial on the television and starts screaming that ""They're going to kill us!""

After that the assailant gets into his car, douses himself with gasoline and then sets himself on fire. Shocked by all of this ""Doctor Challis"" (Tom Atkins) and the victim's daughter ""Ellie Grimbridge"" (Stacey Nelkin) decide to investigate the murder by driving to the last place that the victim visited prior to becoming hysterical. As it so happens, this particular location is also the same place that makes the Halloween masks the victim was clutching upon entering the hospital. Now rather than reveal any more of the plot I will just say that when I first watched this I was somewhat disappointed because I had expected something more along the lines of ""Halloween"" or ""Halloween II"". But having recently watched it again, I have to say it wasn't as bad as I initially thought. Having said that I must also admit it still isn't quite as good as its two predecessors and as a result I have rated it accordingly. Average.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

One of the better parts here is the rather exciting introduction here, which starts with the opening chase through town and going through the junkyard before the rescue and transfer to the hospital which comes along with the stellar stalking in the winds and a violent death before the shocking, explosive finale that this a truly enjoyable start here and launches the investigation really well. The investigation itself is really fun as the creepy town strictly under his control, strange laws that he governs them with and the mysterious bodyguards incapable of pain always shadowing him serving as assassins, bodyguards and technicians who are given tons of fun screen-time here with plenty of great scenes here that truly make them quite a fearsome unit to be recognized as they get plenty of fun, exciting scenes to showcase not only the grand action in here but generate some solid tension with their appearance usually not meaning anything good about to happen. These are some of the film's best parts here with a great stalking at their motel and the chase through the main garage here that leads into the full discovery of what's going on with the assassins, while their other fun scenes later on where the stalk and kill off several of the ones he's informed of what's been uncovered gives this some suspenseful moments to go along with the fine action. As well, the scenes in the factory after being captured are a ton of fun with the cruel and barbaric example sequence of the young kid, the hotel room sequence with the lone woman that really gives this a pretty gruesome killer here that fully explores the true dangers of his evil plans and gets in some really tense sequences here with the escape and attempts to track him down throughout the compound which is quite a blast here with the different encounters and traps set up to stop them giving this the feel of an Action film of the hero taking over the maniacal boss which gives this a lot to really like here. Along with the insanely catchy commercial jingle that runs throughout here, these gives this one enough to hold out over the main flaws here. The film's biggest issue here is that there's quite a lame rationale for the big master-plan here, which has a ton of other potential plans here that could've been attempted to accomplish the same feat yet this one chooses the lamest one which isn't even remotely tied into the actual plan utilized. It's barely even given a full-on reasoning either as he just starts in without really detailing everything and then just stops expecting to fill in the blanks, and really just seems poorly thought-out overall. While there is something that can be said about how this one doesn't fit into the cannon of the series, it's not an issue about the film itself rather than the individual prejudices on that one though, as otherwise this one was a lot of fun.Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language, Brief Nudity and children-in-jeopardy including Graphic Violence against kids.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

27,Aaron1375,It's a shame this didn't do better as we could have gotten an original Halloween movie every year if it had,5,24 October 2016,"In 1981 John Carpenter gave us Halloween II which in the end killed off both Myers and Loomis and would soon begin work on a new Halloween tale that would not feature the bleached William Shatner mask clad figure and instead bring us a new horror for Halloween, Halloween III: Season of the Witch! Had this one been super successful there would have been another horror film released probably the next year featuring a new horror story. Unfortunately, this would not come to pass as so many people could not wrap their little minds around the concept that Myers was not in this film in other than a clip of the original film that was stupidly placed in this film (more on that later). So while the film was not a flop at all, it was met with such a backlash that they scrapped the idea of releasing a new and original Halloween film every year and thus the cycle of making the same film again and again featuring the same killer would begin anew with Halloween IV: The Return of Michael Myers because having both your eyes shot out and being completely engulfed in flames and being burnt to the bone is not enough to stop him! Though one wonders how an old man survived the explosion as well and thus a string of bad sequels would be made making Jason look a lot better as his films were never quite as bad as Halloween 4, 5, 6, H2O and Resurrection were. Seriously, people complain about the Zombie films, but at least his films felt like big budget films while the Halloween sequels I just mentioned seemed like either direct to video crap or a desperate attempt to be another Scream (H2O). Do not get me wrong, this film was not that good either! I like to say it is not as bad as some claim, but not as good as others claim either.The story had promise as it has a man being chased right at the beginning by a strange person in a suit and tie. He manages to escape said man and make his way to a gas station where he finds help and ends up in a hospital where he clutches a strange mask. A doctor there provides assistance (Tom Atkins) and later another person in a suit comes in and kills him and then goes to the parking lot and emulates himself. The old man's daughter is soon there seeking answers and Tom Atkins character wants to know what is going on too. They begin investigating and the trail soon leads them to Santa Mira and the Silver Shamrock corporation. Seems there is a deadly secret being kept dealing with the strange masks they are producing.I enjoy the premise, but they did some things that really doomed this film. One of the main ones was having Halloween as a movie in this film. They should have never reduced Myers to a fictional character in a fictional movie! In fact, they should have made it as if he had lived in this world instead. I think that would have taken care of that complaint as it is foolish to do what they did. I also did not like aspects of the film, mainly the ending as it seemed way to science fiction and the finale where Tom gets the upper hand just should have been a bit more graphic. The deaths range from really good (the woman playing with the chip) to really disappointing (the drill scene). There are also not that many deaths going on and I was getting tired of seeing Tom Atkins putting the moves on his much younger costar.So I am not a huge super fan of this film, nor do I hate it simply because Michael Myers is not in it. Seriously folks, Halloween was around long before the first Halloween film was released so yes, there can be stories of the day not associated with him. Heck, the only time I see anyone even wearing his costume are workers in haunted houses, most dress up in slutty tire outfits and super hero costumes. There was plenty of room for other horrific monsters to come out to play, but sadly, we get the same dude doing the same thing thanks to the rejection of this film. If the series had continued perhaps Michael could have even returned, but instead of the one we got where he comes back with both his eyes and only minor burns we could have gotten his skeletal remains coming out of the grave! Unfortunately, people just do not want different and while this movie is not great by any means, at least it was different.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
28,The_Void,Ridiculous sequel that is as rubbish as it is a mystery,7,19 December 2004,"This unbelievably silly second sequel to the 'Immortal classic' (sic) ""Halloween"" often features prominently on many a horror fan's 'worst horror sequels of all time' list, and for good reason. Before seeing the film, I thought it might be due to the fact that it doesn't feature cinema's most boring serial killer, Michael Myers at all. However, now that I have seen it; the reason has become clear. Quite frankly, this movie is ridiculous. The plot follows a factory, lead by a madman, that is producing Halloween masks that, wait for it...have mind control abilities. Oh dear. This plot is followed by an 'investigation', which is only ever laughable at best. It fails to garner any intrigue, simply due to it's complete lack of credibility. I seriously cannot believe that whoever wrote this rubbish thought that they would be able to pull it off. Even as a horror-comedy, or a spoof it doesn't work; let alone a serious horror film.As mentioned, Michael Myers isn't in the film. Well, not quite; we do get a view of him on a TV screen after the first movie is described as an 'immortal classic' (sounds like something John Carpenter would say), but other than that; he's not in it. This may sound good to you (it certainly did to me), but it's actually just another bad point for the movie that has bad points coming out of it's ears. Halloween fans wont like it because the star of the series isn't present, and non-Halloween fans (like me) wont like it because it's rubbish. I'm not even sure why this movie is in the Halloween series. Perhaps the producers decided that they wanted something more than the dull kill-fest's of the first film (as opposed to exciting kill-fest's, shown in other films), or perhaps someone had written a Halloween-themed horror movie and wanted people to see it. I don't know. Saying that; the movie isn't all bad. It mostly is, but there are a couple of death scenes that, ironically, are far better than any of the boring ones in the rest of the Halloween series.

The plot is preposterous but the movie is entertaining overall if you just watch it. Tom Atkins does a believable job as a doctor. The trip to Santa Mira is well worth the viewing about a secretive town with lots of secrets. Dan O'Herlihy played the mysterious and creepy owner. The factory scenes are creepy and the plot doesn't entirely make sense to me but it's the first Halloween movie I saw and it stuck with me. The film has plenty of flaws but it tries hard.

At the end of Halloween 2 The Shape is supposed to be death and John Carpenter decided to give the franchise another direction. Instead of exploiting The Shape he wanted to make every year a flick centered around the holiday itself. Further on John also made the decision to stop writing or directing another Halloween. Editor and production designer from the original Halloween Tommy Lee Wallace wanted to create something completely different from the first two entries. He wanted to leave the slashers and wanted to go more into the 'Invasion Of The Body Snatcher' story.Of course Halloween was know for The Shape and had so many fans that they all hated Halloween 3. There is no 'Shape' in it, there is no worth about Laurie Strode, not even one single worth about Michael Meyers. The funny thing is that when Dr. Daniel 'Dan' Challis (Tom Atkins) is watching a flick it's the original Halloween that is playing. But is it all that bad as they say? Well, indeed, as a continuing story it really doesn't fit into the series, they should have only called it Season Of The Witch. On the other hand, if you watch it as a stand alone it isn't that bad after all. It is slow, that I admit but it also has some cruel and even some gory deaths. The effects used at the end are not up to date to today's standards. But the effects for the killings were well done, the decapitations really worked as did the masks and for example the bugs coming out of ones face. The stunts were created by Dick Warlock who played The Shape in Halloween 2. It doesn't fit into the slasher genre which was at his top around 1982 but it has plenty of other things: good acting, an interesting mystery, a sinister villain, an appropriately dark tone, and an eerie atmosphere.

The sad part of it all, is that it kind of works in the way a very deranged, incredibly hokey storyline works. While leaving the genre's Michael Myers character behind, it embraces goofiness from the start and seems to be self-aware to the fact that the audience knows that, so it never decides to go overboard and fill itself with unnecessary self-referential humor.Perhaps if this film was simply called, Season of the Witch, and had nothing to do with the John Carpenter's renowned Halloween franchise it would've found some love. The producers intentions were to concoct a completely new setup, putting Myers' story on hold while welcoming a new cast and a new director, Tommy Lee Wallace, of Max Headroom and, later on, Stephen King's It fame.Our story focuses on an ordinary town, roughly a week before Halloween, when all of a sudden, commercials for ""Silver Shamrock"" masks begin replaying constantly on TV. The commercials are infused with a catchy jingle singing, ""Eight more days till Halloween, Halloween, Halloween. Eight more days till Halloween, Silver Shamrock,"" soliciting pumpkin, skeleton, and witch masks to little tykes, imploring them to put their masks on in front of the TV at a certain time on Halloween night for ""a special giveaway."" Meanwhile, a local woman (Stacey Nelkin) teams up with the town doctor (Tom Atkins) to try and piece together why a toy store manager committed suicide in his car, which leads them to investigate the Silver Shamrock Novelties factory, ran by Dan O'Herlihy. His incorruptible nihilism on how he plans to carry out his plans to brainwash children by making them by one of his masks is quite fiendishly taking to watch.This isn't particularly compelling cinema, or even very substantial horror cinema. Compared to the original 1978 groundbreaker which merged the horror genre with borderline film noir, this one is lost and wanders from a narrative and a screen writing point of view. I wonder if I was a die-hard Halloween fan how I would've responded to this film in 1982. But how often do I complain about horror films lacking originality and simply being made to serve an executive's pocket? The fact that the series took a risk is admirable enough. To see the risk finally get the respect it deserves is even more heartwarming. Halloween III incorporates pleasantly suspenseful atmosphere with an eerily unique premise for a result that's equal parts enjoyable camp and inanely entertaining horror.Starring: Stacey Nelkin, Tom Atkins, and Dan O'Herlihy.

I know that this movie gets a lot of complaints, but actually I can see where the writers were going with this. They just had an idea to continue the Halloween stories, but just to do a different type of franchise, which I give them a lot of credit for. Does this movie deliver the same scares as the original Halloween or even the sequel? No, it doesn't, but it's still creepy and not given a proper chance by most. Just the song that is used alone in this movie was a bit intense. It's a great little ghost story that is sure to deliver chills if you have an open mind to it.

All of us."" While Grimbridge is hospitalized, another man in a suit enters his room and pulls his skull apart. The man then returns to his vehicle, douses himself with gasoline and lights himself on fire, causing the car to explode. Challis, together with Grimbridge's daughter, Ellie, begins an investigation that leads them to the home of the Silver Shamrock Novelties factory. They learn from a hotel manager, Mr. Rafferty, that the source of the town's prosperity is Irishman Conal Cochran and his factory and that the majority of the town's population is made up of descendants of Irish immigrants. Challis learns that Ellie's father had stayed at the same hotel. Other guests of the hotel included shop owners Marge Guttman, Buddy, Betty and their son ""Little"" Buddy. All have business at the factory and eventually meet gruesome ends because of the Silver Shamrock masks.The Kupfer family views the Silver Shamrock commercial that will air on Halloween night. But there's more to these masks then meets the eye. Is Halloween 3 the best sequel? No; is it the worst sequel? No; I'd say just a lot of people got the wrong idea about the movie and didn't know what the writers were thinking when the wrote for this franchise. I loved the ending scene, it actually did give me a nightmare, I don't want to give it away though, just trust me, it's a creepy scene. I do recommend if you love horror movies to give this movie a fair chance or if you want to see the Halloween movie franchise, just remember that the writers just wanted to try something new. I do honestly like this movie, I hope people will see it for what it is and it's just a good ghost story to watch on a night for Halloween.6/10",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
35,Red-Barracuda,A good film tarnished by being part of the Halloween series,7,31 July 2009,"Halloween III: the Season of the Witch must rank as one of the strangest sequels to a franchise in the history of cinema. It's a film that generally speaking does not have a good reputation. The main reason for the bad attitude to this movie is clearly because the vast majority of people unsurprisingly go into this film with the expectation of seeing another Michael Myers romp, and evidently a lot of viewers aren't overly impressed by his absence here. Moreover, Halloween III is not even in the same sub-genre as the rest of the series, seeing as it is a sci-fi horror as opposed to slasher flick. In other words, if this film had been a standalone movie it would most probably be regarded as a fairly original little horror flick; it certainly would not have attracted nearly as much negativity. John Carpenter, the director of the first instalment, had the reasonably good idea of making each Halloween instalment a different standalone horror tale set on Halloween night. Unfortunately his grand plan was undermined by a rather silly flaw, in that the previous film, Halloween 2, was a continuation of the Michael Myers story, therefore, it was hardly surprising that the expectation would be that subsequent instalments followed this same formula in the manner of the likes of the Friday the 13th series. As a result, Season of the Witch was met with bemusement and the franchise reverted back to Myers mayhem for the remainder of the series.It's a shame that Halloween 3 wasn't released as a standalone movie called simply Season of the Witch because this is a quirky horror flick with a good amount of invention. Sure it's a bit silly in places, with a few plot holes (i.e. wouldn't the differing American time zones screw up the scheduling of Silver Shamrock's death-by-television extravaganza?) but it's odd enough to always remain interesting. I liked the spooky town that Silver Shamrock seemed to control, with ominous CCTV, odd inhabitants and sinister tannoy announcements. The suit-wearing bad guys were also a bit different to the typical psychotic villains, and I thought they were integrated well into the film. Acting-wise Dan O'Herlihy was very good as the evil chief mask-maker, while the rest of the cast was serviceable enough. The famous 'Happy Happy Halloween' theme song was used extensively but I liked it and felt it conveyed the feeling that something was not quite right with the Silver Shamrock promotional campaign. This, of course, is borne out with an ending to the movie that is refreshingly nihilistic.This should not have been part of the Halloween series. The association is unfortunate. But as an unconnected standalone movie, Season of the Witch has got quite a lot to offer as a horror film.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
36,Rainey-Dawn,The Odd-Ball Film of the Series,7,3 July 2014,"The only real problem with this film is that is has zero to do with Michael Myers. It is a monkey-wrench in the film series. What Halloween III: Season of the Witch (1982) really is: a completely different story and it should have had a different movie title - that is the only real problem with the flick! If the movie was entitled ""The Halloween Masks"" or even something like ""Silver Shamrock"" then people might not critique the film so harshly and rate this movie higher.The story itself is not entirely all that bad - it's actually pretty good if you think of it as watching just another horror film and not in the context of another Michael Myer's story.Remove your ""Michael Myer's thinking cap"" put on your ""horror movie thinking cap"" when you watch this movie - you will enjoy it a lot better that way I believe.Also this makes Halloween 4 actually Halloween 3 as far as Michael Myers is concerned.7.5/10",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

38,OllieSuave-007,No Michael Myers in this one.,7,13 October 2017,"This second sequel to the ""Halloween"" series does not have the same storyline or continuity of Michael Myers. Instead, we have a totally different plot about a company called the Silver Shamrock who manufactures Halloween masks for kids. The owner, Conal Cochran, wants to murder people during Halloween through an ancient Celtic ritual involving a stolen boulder from Stonehenge and the masks.This has an interesting and unique storyline, somewhat chilling and suspenseful - plenty of investigative action, but not much on ghost or horror action. The commercial jingle that advertises the Halloween masks was pretty annoying, the love affair between the two leads was random, and some of the scenes were left ambiguous. Still, not a bad film - there's decent acting and a rather fast-paced plot to keep you interested.Grade B-",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
39,thesar-2,Michael went witch way?,3,21 August 2009,"Probably because of higher expectations I had for #2 did I rate 'Halloween III: Season of the Witch' a half star higher. 'III' wasn't a great movie, not even a good movie, but not the worst I've ever seen. I admired a few things that brought my rating to 2/5 stars. I admired its ambition to not only say Michael really did die in #2 (a rarity in slasher sequels) but continue the series with a new angle/twist. I also liked, as morbid as it sounds, that not only was the target children, but they actually killed an innocent boy (albeit a brat) on screen. Seldom will they show that on screen, so it's not so much I liked that they killed a child, but the gall to actually break away from what might offend some. In addition, they stacked more gore than the first two combined, if you're into that sort of thing. All that said, this really was a mess with enough holes that 2 stones from Stonehenge couldn't plug up. (Hmm..it seems to be 9PM all around the world at the same time!) We begin with a hilariously uninteresting and painful to watch chase scene where a man claims everyone's gonna die. Enter Dr. Who('ll never work again) and sidekick on the Scooby trail of the Mystery of the Masks. Apparently, there's a dark secret behind the masks, which are aided by an eerie commercial. Well, eerie the first time and downright annoying the 2nd-45th time. Throw in a 'Tales from the Crypt' rejected script with a total 80's plot with 80's opening, action, romance, bad guys, comical multiple endings and the funniest ""Well, I'm going to kill you anyways, so here's my evil plot"" dialogue ever. Question: without spoiling, ask yourself why the killer in the opening not only used gloves, but wiped them clean.

All of this without a whiff of Michael Myers.It's too bad this movie was titled Halloween III. The film gets an unfair shake from those who whine about it not being a Michael Myers film. John Carpenter always intended for the Halloween franchise to be like this - a different Halloween-themed story each year. I wish the series had kept this idea.I've always enjoyed watching Halloween III: Season of the Witch. To begin with, I've always found the Myers-less plot of Part III fairly original. Sure, the story's not perfect and some of it makes no sense (Stonehenge? Really?), but there's enough here that we've never seen before to keep things interesting. Dan O'Herlihy makes for an excellent, but underutilized, baddie. His Stepford-esque henchmen are especially creepy. Another plus are the special effects - perfectly gory. Even after repeat viewings, there's at least one scene I still find disturbing and difficult to watch. Finally Stacey Nelkin has to be one of the most stunning women I've ever seen in a horror movie.

41,lost-in-limbo,"""Please, this commercial never stops""!",6,20 April 2013,"Everyone by now would know the story of ""Halloween III"" copping a real shellacking when released by critics and fans hoping that they would get another entry featuring the unstoppable shape aka Michael Myers of the previous two films. But at the time John Carpenter and Debra Hill wanted the franchise to take on a different approach which led to ""Season of the Witch"", making it a sequel in name only. So this one would be the atypical one of the series, but the most refreshing and creative entry by far. As a stand alone it might have been better accepted, but as it is there's nothing there to think otherwise and this can seen as a true definition of a cult film that has grown popular over the years. The Halloween roots are there, where the unhinged plot centres of the traditions and witchcraft origins (where Stone Hedge features prominently in its angle of ancient technology) with a fascinating premise that's bleak, dark and virtually a clever reworking of the body snatchers formula. One night while on duty Dr. Daniel Challis gets a patient brought in who has been attacked and is completely off his mind while clutching a Halloween mask, which he won't let go of and warning them that death is coming to all. Things get even stranger when the patient is brutally murdered and the culprit kills himself in front of Challis. Wanting to get to the bottom of it he joins the victim's daughter who was toy salesman where they travel to Santa Mira to the Silver Shamrock Novelties Company who sells these popular masks. There they slowly discover the sinister plans that its founder Conal Cochran has in store.Director / writer Tommy Lee Wallace crafts out such a tight, moody and paranoid horror piece with terrific locations being used (eerie factory town), thrilling pace, nasty shocks embed, gliding camera-work, a pulsating electronic score and numerous lurking figures in suits. The special effects are masterfully detailed with the masks being the centre piece and it achieves some grisly FX work. The cast are game with Tom Atkins bringing a rough and ready persona (as there was a lot of physical work), but still having the charm to carry the story. Stacy Nelkin is quite good and Dan O'Herlihy is suitably menacing in such an effortless manner. He simply looked the part and made it so intriguing. Then you got that jingle ""Happy, Happy Halloween"". Try your best in getting that out of your head. And the ending has that haunting touch which really does touch a nerve.

42,bowmanblue,"You will probably hate this film (personally, I loved it)",8,31 October 2014,"Let's get it out of the way... 'Halloween 3: Season of the Witch' was a critical (and more importantly) commercial failure. Basically, after the highly successful (and profitable) 'Halloween' and 'Halloween 2' people were expecting big things from the third instalment. The first two were about a – seemingly unstoppable – killer called Michael Myers and his relentless desire to generally murder youngsters. However, Part 3's ultimate 'failure' was that it basically has nothing to do with the first two instalments.Part 3 is a completely new story which doesn't follow on at all. And that was the main 'problem' people had with it. So, it got immediately slated and has kind of fallen off the radar, as far as horror movies go.However, if you don't really look at it as a 'Halloween' movie and simply a stand-alone horror film, it does tend to take on a life of its own. We join Dr Daniel Challis when a possibly mentally-unstable old man is brought into his hospital, only to be murdered in very suspicious circumstances. Therefore, Dr Dan teams up with the man's grieving daughter to investigate. And, their investigation takes them to an out-of-the-way town in the middle of nowhere, run by the – somewhat creepy – Conal Cochran.First of all, Dr Dan is a rather different hero. He isn't very reliable, frequently forgets to visit his ex-wife, buys his kids rubbish present, flirts with pretty much anything in a skirt in the hospital where he works and then sleeps with younger women in meets in a bar (all while wearing a handkerchief hanging out of the back of his trousers). And, did I mention while he's doing all this he's also trying to save the world from cyborg robots and fiendish occult plots.But, dodgy heroes aside, the film is actually pretty creepy. First of all you have the music (which is done by horror legend John Carpenter) which adds to the dark, unsettling atmosphere. Then you have Dan O'herlihy, playing arguably one of the most nasty villains in cinematic history. He really does have a plan or two up his sleeve and it isn't nice! Then you have the general gore. It's hardly a 'gore-fest' but when the gore comes, it's pretty gruesome and what isn't gory is pretty unsettling.If you want to give Halloween 3 a go, don't view it as part of the franchise. Just be in a mood for a darkly-nasty horror tale. It's also probably best to put at least half of your brain on hold for the duration – that way you can ignore the odd plot hole.

43,ericstevenson,That was something...bad,3,5 October 2017,"The ""Halloween"" movies were originally intended to be an anthology series which is why this doesn't have any connection to the other Halloween films. Due to the poor reception of this movie, they went back to making the whole thing about Michael Myers. This is a very dumb movie with a ridiculous plot. Children are buying Halloween masks from a company that's using them to kill children. Like Leonard Maltin said, ""Nice, huh?"". They die when a commercial airs and the mask makes spiders and snakes come out of the kids' bodies and kill their parents. It's as dumb as it sounds.The operation is caused by robots with yellow blood or yellow oil or whatever. The main character fights robots to stop snakes and spiders from coming out of kid's bodies. It's as stupid as it sounds. The only good parts are the very end and when the main character is escaping. The Nostalgia Critic gave a brief audio review of it but oddly enough he later said he liked it! I'm going with his first opinion and dismiss the film for being stupid.

48,Bored_Dragon,Even a carpenter would do it better (pun intended),3,4 January 2019,"After several minutes of ugly, monotonous and boring opening credits I already doubted that the movie will be any better. I was not wrong. The film is a disaster. Carpenter intended for every movie in the ""Halloween"" franchise to be a separate story, but after the success of the first one, they forced him to make a direct sequel. With the third film he returned to his original idea and failed terribly. The film has nothing to do with its predecessors, nor with the brain. Somehow they managed to make a movie in which the story feels hasted, although the film itself is rather slow and boring. The acting is mournful, and the film is in every way cheap and badly done, as if the carpenter hammered it from leftovers. The story is dull, unconvincing and pointless and overall resembles mediocre episode of some cheap TV series like ""Tales from the Darkside"" or ""Monsters"" (""Twilight Zone"" is for this unreachable masterpiece). It is hard to believe that this is actually a part of the legendary franchise, and not an amateur TV movie. And just when I asked myself why I even waste my time on something so incredibly stupid, the movie surprised me and became even more stupid. The peak of shame transfer was reached in the extremely corny cliché in the motel room, the scene that almost made me vomit. And a totally battered final plot twist knocked the last nail in the coffin of this garbage. Literally the only thing in this movie that is worth seeing is the beauty of Stacey Nelkin, but I advise you, from all my heart, to simply google her photos instead.3/10",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
49,ironhorse_iv,Halloween 3: Season of the Witch deserve another look. It's not as bad as people make it out to be. Happy Halloween!,5,26 October 2014,"'Happy, Happy Halloween! Halloween! Halloween! Silver Shamrock! It's almost time, kids. The clock is ticking. Be in front of your TV sets for the Horrorthon, followed by the Big Giveaway at 9.' quote the commercial in this film. Directed by Tommy Lee Wallace, the movie is about a Halloween company's evil plot to kill millions of American children with deadly Halloween masks. These masks have a deadly computer chip made from a fragment of Stonehenge. When Silver Shamrock's commercial would air on Halloween night, the chip was to unleash a lethal swarm of insects and snakes, killing the wearer and anyone in the immediate vicinity. One might look at this film on paper, and call it silly at the time, but in a way, some people has smarten up and relooked it in a different light. It has gather somewhat of a cult status due to the fact that, it has taken as its own film and not part of the Halloween Slasher series. It also actually contains some interesting social commentary about commercialism and American greed. The movie is also has a lot of throwback to 1950s/ 1960 paranoia horror films like 1956's Invasion of the Body Snatchers & 1960's Psycho with hidden gems like the city of Santa Mira & the motel scene. You even see hidden homage to both of the previous Halloween films from 1978 & 1981 with clips of the previous film playing in the background and actors from the films having cameos like Jamie Lee Curtis as the curfew announcer. Still, it makes you wonder, if Michael Myer's Halloween was a movie than, why is Halloween 4 call Halloween 4, and not Halloween 3? It also makes you wonder how were; there even kids in 1988's Halloween 4: Return of the Michael Myers? The movie does have that fault, where the plot doesn't make a lot of sense. After all, it's mind-boggling to see oddly place twist and turns with robot androids, unexplained witchcraft, and random sex scenes. It drag the weak plot along with little to no exposition. How did they steal Stonehenge and shipping it secretly across the Atlantic? How does nobody in the western seaboard know about the fatal course-inducting ad? U.S does have four time zones. Even the film tagline doesn't make sense, ""The night nobody comes home"" is a play on the original Halloween movie's tagline, ""The night, he came home."". If nobody came home, then does that mean that the children were saved, because none of them were able to watch the television program? By the end of the film, you're left with the question, 'WTF! Did I watch!?"". Another fault of the film could be the overacting and underacting of the actors. Tom Atkins as the protagonist, Dr. Dan Challis wasn't what I call, memorable. He seem to fade in the background at times when stronger and more cartoony supporting characters are on the screen like Conal Cochran (Dan O'Herlihy). Cochran is great, and really steals the film from Tom Atkins. He's a lot creepier than Michael Myers ever can be. Another reason why people might not like this film is because Myers isn't in it. Due to the success of the 1978 original, a sequel was indeed made, but when the studio want yet another movie. Producer John Carpenter had enough with the tiresome slasher. John Carpenter decided to transform the series into a yearly anthology of films centered around various aspects of Halloween. John Carpenter even try to pull the Halloween name from the film, wanting it to be titled: Season of the Witch. The idea was made because they wanted to keep the franchise alive and fresh, but any one of the entries could in turn become a franchise in its own right, spinning off its own sequels. It sounded like a studio's dream. Other producers like Dino De Laurentiis went against it, as it could be used as a hook to get audience members to see the film. Instead, Dino De Laurentiis ask for more blood and gore to the story, to feed the audience hungry for Michael Myers. Too bad, the special effects for the film were pretty cheesy and mediocre. The original writer of the story Nigel Kneale left during the production, and sued the producers to take his name off the movie after seeing how violent cheesy, it was. Halloween III attempted to accomplish the violent task without Nigel Kneale and original director Joe Dante, but ended up met with a massive backlash from a fan base and critics. It performed poorly at the box office due to this reason. As a result, John Carpenter walked away from the franchise, which would be given a reboot with Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers continuing the story from the original two films. It's sad in a way, because Halloween 3: Season of the Witch is more a Halloween movie than the original 1978's slasher film as the theme of the holiday plays more into the plot. It's an intelligent, surprising, and disturbing holiday film with a number of nice touches like the Silver Shamrock commercial. Not only is the tune, catchy as hell, but it was haunting to watch. Yes, it could be a bit annoying due to the overplay nature of it, but that's what's scary about it. It's an evil thing, hidden under children innocent. A novelization of the film was published in 1982 by science-fiction writer Dennis Etchison under the pseudonym Jack Martin. Despite the film's commercial failure, the book became a best-seller and was even reissued two years after the film's release, in 1984. Overall: Halloween III: Season of the Witch is one of my favorite guilty pleasure horror movies besides the nihilistic ending. While, it's not a good movie at all. It's still, entertaining.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

I found the acting, especially from Tom Atkins, reasonably good and I enjoyed the plot and setting in the village. The film reminded me of an interesting episode from an 80s crime TV series.

53,Dr_Coulardeau,Science-fiction does not necessarily go well with horror,8,15 January 2007,"The only film of the series of five that will not deal with the insane immortal criminal with his kitchen knife. Here Carpenter moves to another theme : some crazy Irishman is going to play a trick on the children of this world and then take over the whole world. The first task will be performed through the millions of Halloween masks he is producing and selling in the world, with television as the trigger to ignite the malevolence of these masks which will turn the kids into wasps and snakes and plainly kill them at the very neat hour of 2100 hours on the 31st of October. The second task will be achieved through the army of robotized mechanical human beings that will just rake over the world and destroy any resistance. We are in science-fiction this time and fear is definitely less important. It may terrorize the audience but with the menace of a mad scientist this time and again. But it does not horrifies the audience because this concept of taking over the world with robots is too gross to be really believable. Many films have done better along that line since then and even before then. The Time Machine and 1984 for the older generation and The Matrix or Cube for the newer generation. In other words it is rather disappointing though it is altogether kept going at the proper rhythm and the end is both predictable and fresh enough not to look too simplistic. But definitely too many allusions to and borrowings from too many films and other works of imagination to be attributed any imagination of its own.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
54,poe426,Superb SF shocker...,10,6 January 2009,"Second only to the original HALLOWEEN in the series, HALLOWEEN III stands the test of time. Craftsmanship still counts. At the time of its release, I likened SEASON OF THE WITCH to sf shockers (shockers with a decidedly sf bent) like FIVE MILLION YEARS TO EARTH. For a brief moment, it looked like the HALLOWEEN saga had taken a turn for the better. John Carpenter, in at least one interview at the time of the movie's release, expressed a desire to do a completely new HALLOWEEN movie every year. Imagine: an on-going series under the HALLOWEEN banner; the possibilities were endless. Unfortunately, the movie-going public balked at the idea of something original and clamored for more of the same- which is just what they got. I've seen only one of the HALLOWEEN films since III (HALLOWEEN H20), so I can't really comment on their relative worth- but I do know that I was greatly disappointed that the idea of a totally new HALLOWEEN movie on an annual basis never came to pass. More's the pity.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
55,johnnyboyz,"Not without its haters but Halloween III is a great chunk of 1980s schlock horror that captivates and scares in its own, unique way.",6,15 November 2007,"If Halloween is 'classic' and its sequel Halloween II is 'rubbish' (both my opinions) then Halloween III is somewhere in-between. True, in-between fantastic and awful is an extremely large space in which a lot of films lie but I truly believe that Halloween III deserves it. The first and most obvious mistake people make with this film regarding actually liking it is the inclusion (or lack of) Michael Myers  my only advice is 'do not watch this film as a Halloween film as such'; it's based around Halloween and has a pretty implausible idea for a premise and yet as a film alone, it manages to stand all by itself as an entertaining, well paced and unpredictable film that has its fair share of cheap thrills, schlock horror moments and gore.Looking into Halloween III a little more deeply, you will see a statement on Halloween as a whole. The incessant repetition of the Silver Shamrock advert or jingle since it's also on the radio is not one of the reasons the film's crap; it's the constant reminder of what Halloween has become: cheap, tacky and utilised to sell products. Indeed, the antagonist of the film (a sort of God like dictator whom closely resembles pure evil) states that Halloween used to be a proper celebration or acknowledgement of a certain something: evilness and all things nasty. When Veteran's Day or Remembrance Sunday comes along, we don't celebrate it but we certainly acknowledge it as some things need not be forgot. Conal Cochran is saying that Halloween has turned into a consumerism joke over the centuries and he is trying to move things back to the 'old times'.It's true that the film borrows heavily from the science fiction and fantasy genre but horror still remains its primary genre with 'to scare' still the primary aim. When we are first shown the trailer for Halloween (1978) on a television, this immediately zones us out of whatever world Halloween is set and distances itself from Myers and Haddonfield as a whole  it was at this point that the film could've crashed and burnt since it's supposed to take place in the 'real' world where only so much is physically possible; thankfully, Halloween III stays realistic until the final twenty minutes and even then given the science fiction and fantasy that has crept in, it still remains plausible. Halloween III is slower and smarter than Halloween II and changes things round a bit more: Jaime Lee Curtis has gone and as a hero, is replaced by a hard bodied doctor called Daniel Challis (Atkins). Myers as a villain is replaced by the Silver Shamrock company/factory as a whole since they are both big, mysterious and seemingly indestructible and although Conal remains a frail old man, he hides dark secrets.Halloween III takes a Village of the Damned approach without children in the sense a bizarre town seemingly populated by possessed humans (turns out they're robots) and run in the middle of nowhere by a massive corporation. The idea that a Halloween mask can do the things that it can thanks to a microchip that is activated by a certain signal through a TV advertisement may seem elaborate but like I said, fantasy/horror is not something we are new to these days and if you're talking about back in the early 1980s then I guess Halloween III must have been ahead of its time because the elaborate content and ideas are not an excuse to dislike or hate the film. There is a strong feeling of no hope; a wonderful atmosphere of unpredictability and horror and yet we feel Dr. Challis is up to the challenge so we are kept on the edge of our seat unlike in Halloween II where Myers may have decapitated everyone in the hospital but the scrawny, weak and non-sexually active character of Laurie is enough to win in the end  there is none of that clichéd horror nonsense here, just well placed jumps; the right amount of violence and a nasty ending that will leave a nasty taste in the mouth. I can recommend Halloween III over Halloween II any day but if you watch it forgetting about John Carpenter, Michael Myers and all that business and without knowing what happens when the mask is 'activated' in a certain scene, you will enjoy this quirky and surreal 80s horror.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

However, there is a difference between gore and suspense. Alfred Hitchcock was the master of suspense. He could do more in one scene with out showing any violence or blood than any of these movies could ever poop out. This is not in any way a scary or suspenseful movie. It is gore. Period.There is no imagination left to the movie. The key to making a good scary movie is to let the viewer form their images in their own mind. Then they scare their selves. The best way to ruin a movie is to show too much. That's the problem with this movie. It shows everything. Who cares? Idiots. People who only want to see blood and guts.

59,Anonymous_Maxine,"What's this about a witch, now?",5,3 December 2004,"Almost universally hated for being such a digression from the much known and loved Halloween movies, Halloween III comes along almost like John Carpenter and Debra Hill, who produced it, are trying to sneak up on audiences and show them something they weren't expecting. While it's true that it has absolutely nothing to do with the two Michael Meyers slashers that came before it other than the fact that we see commercials for the original Halloween film on TV sets in this movie a couple times, it's not true that this is one of the worst horror films ever made, as I've heard it called very many times. I saw the movie about ten years ago, when I was in junior high school, and the two things that I remember were bugs crawling out of the masks while they were on peoples' heads and that god-awful music they played during the Silver Shamrock commercials. So when I watched it again tonight I tried to look at it as a separate film from the other Halloween movies, because I think that it's association with them is a large part of why so many people hate it. In a horror series that at the time of this writing has spawned seven sequels, including this one, it's the one movie that simply doesn't belong. Unfortunately, even as a separate film, Halloween III doesn't have much going for it.Clearly, there was enough stock put into the disturbing nature of the crime involved, since we are not given a reason for its existence. An elderly toy maker has developed a scheme to sell masks rigged with secret electronic devices, then on Halloween night at 9pm stage a Big Giveaway on TV, at which point he will broadcast a special commercial I supposed reminiscent of those commercials in Japan that are supposed to give you seizures. This version will activate the electronic devices lodged in the masks and cause them to somehow turn kids heads into piles of creepy crawlies.What is the purpose behind this scheme? What does this guy hope to achieve? And what the hell does Stonehenge have to do with anything? His hordes of robotic assistants is at least explainable by his need for secrecy given what he's really up to in that factory (and I imagine they have something to do with his remarkable ability to essentially hold an entire town hostage without even a single person leaving and complaining to authorities.Early in the film, a guy runs frantically into a gas station asking for help and is brought to a hospital to receive medical attention. Once there, a well-dressed gentleman walks calmly into his hospital room and pulls his skull apart, then just as calmly walks outside, gets into his car, douses himself with gasoline and promptly sets himself on fire. The subsequent mess is left to the hospital staff to clean up, as the car is left smoldering in the parking lot the next day without an inch of police tape around it and a lab technician is left to pore through the ashes. What is truly funny is the length of time that this technician spends sifting through these ashes before she realizes that they are nothing but car parts, a stupendous explosion of idiocy that she describes as a 'colossal boo-boo.'The doctor working at the hospital takes it upon himself to do a little investigating into the situation, traveling to the town that houses the Silver Shamrock factory, which of course sports an Irish caricature of a man presiding over the local hotel. I have to admit that I thought that the 'misfire' scene was pretty impressive, and is one of at least a few scenes that tend to argue that this movie deserved a title that would not have cast it in an eternal shadow. For the first thirty minutes or so, the movie is very impressive. The opening shot of the man running as fast as he can out of a calm night is especially unsettling, as is that entire chase between him and his robotic pursuers, whom we know nothing about at the time. But the more we learn about what's really going on, the less believable the movie becomes, until it hits rock bottom with Conal Cochran, the evil toymaker, gleefully giving Challis, the investigating doctor, a tour of his underground facility and a detailed description of his wicked plans, coming dangerously close to a Scooby-Doo ending. I really don't think that the movie is as bad as so many people seem to think, it's just too bad that it starts out so well but by the end the last attacks of the final un-killable robot are simply tiresome. By the end, I was just waiting for it to end, but at the beginning I found it very interesting. I think that these two things balance themselves out in terms of the quality of the movie, and then the association with the other two previous Halloween films is just another nail in this movie's coffin.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
60,gwnightscream,A True Halloween Movie!,6,9 December 2006,"Tom Atkins, Stacey Nelkin and Dan O'Herlihy star in this 1982 horror film. A doctor and a woman discover an evil toymaker's plot of selling deadly masks. I remember seeing a glimpse of this movie a long time ago and didn't think much of it. I finally watched the whole thing a few years ago and thought it was interesting. I really like the music too and think it's some of John Carpenter's best work. Dan was terrific as Conal Cochran and Tom is great as usual. This is a true Halloween movie and it's too bad we didn't get more different Halloween tales that Carpenter intended. I think the main reason most people don't like it is because it has nothing to do with Michael Myers. I agree it should've been called, ""Season of the Witch,"" but like the fact that it was something different and definitely has that Halloween feel to it.

61,GOWBTW,WHAT?! NO MICHAEL MYERS? WHAT IS THIS?,5,31 October 2018,"Is this a sequel? If it is, what did I miss? This movie is a mystery and it is not a sequel by any means.
Instead of the usual Haddonfield, Ill., it takes place in California. Instead of dealing with the inhuman killer, Michael Myers, you are dealing with a owner of a Halloween party shop who is dealing in witchcraft. The Silver Shamrock mask company not only sells the mask, they are using the children as sacrifice. Whenever the commercial airs, the flashing Jack-o-lantern appears, and instant death occurs. Two people are out to find the owner, stop him and the company, and keep Halloween safe for everyone.
I don't know who came up with this idea. It's different from the last two films. Not as scary as them. Maybe, they wanted the people feel at ease in Haddonfield. But this movie was a letdown. I wouldn't call it a sequel.

62,FiendishDramaturgy,Dismally ignorant wannabe,1,15 September 2004,"This is more a ""true"" sequel to the idea behind the Halloween line than it is to Michael Meyers. However...Carpenter's intent was to have a fresh new movie each Halloween, each bearing the Halloween name and each with a new story and a new director. So based on his intent, this movie is the only ""real"" Halloween sequel. Unfortunately, that does not make it GOOD!!That having been said, this attempt is rather puerile and attempts to execute a plot line which could have been written by an eight-year-old. It is mediocre at best, bearing huge plot holes, major annoying contrivances and only a half decent story line. The song, ""8 More Days"" is both memorable and possibly the most annoying commercial jingle ever created. The musical score is an odd blend of theater and church organry and in some places it's an almost unbearable combination of both.SPOILERSThe premise: An evil toy company has hatched a plot to kill all the children via some really freaky little Halloween masks, subliminals, and magick used with evil intent. This same company is the ""largest in the world,"" yet seemingly only manufactures three cheaply made masks, while it also manufactures androids and the AI to run them?! And they have aspirations of world domination. Of course they do. Plot holes and contrivances. The movie is riddled with them. The acting quality is laughable and the character development is non-existent. Not that either of these elements could have saved this attempt.It bears a distinct 80's ""Children of the Corn"" type feeling in that it involves the entire town, is horribly dated, and frankly, does not bear a remake. The story here simply does not rate it. Some critics have praised this story as ""original, clever, inspired"" work. Honestly, the reason why it had the advantage of never having been seen before is because it is about the most inane piece of garbage on film.I personally don't see anything ""inspired"" about it. It lacks intelligence on even the most base levels, utilizes cheap thrills (not that there ARE any ""thrills"") and goes for that gag reflex, three unattractive elements for ANY movie. Unfortunately, those were the good points.Michael Myers or no Michael Myers, this movie reeked, all by itself. Other critics say this is a fine stand alone movie. Compared to what? This does not stand, it lays there, so flaccid and weak it cannot even hold up its head.It rates a 2.2/10 on the ""B"" scale. That's somewhere like a 0.8/10 on the ""A"" scale, from...the Fiend :.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
63,jtindahouse,A clunky film that actually had potential,5,5 November 2018,"'Halloween III: Season of the Witch' is quite a lucky film in the sense that if it hadn't been made under the 'Halloween' series tag very few people would likely have heard of it. As I understand after 'Michael Myers' was killed at the end of 'Halloween II' they decided to turn the series into an anthology with a different story being released every halloween. I actually quite like the concept and wish it had lasted a little longer. The problem is I also like the character of 'Michael Myers' and was glad that he eventually returned. Had this been a slightly stronger film who knows how things could have turned out.Writer/director Tommy Lee Wallace was on debut in this film, and unfortunately it shows through in quite a few ways. Something I found very off-putting was how characters were constantly cutting each other off and talking over each other. You can call this bad acting for sure, but the director also needs to be picking up on this and making sure it doesn't happen. Also some of the death scenes in this film were filmed absolutely terribly. There is a scene where a car rolls into someone and crushes them to death. The car was moving at about 2 kilometres an hour and would have been very obvious to see coming. In fact there are a number of times where characters should blatantly be able to see something and just for the sake of the story don't. The whole production was very sloppy it has to be said.On the positive side of the ledger, there are some good scares sprinkled into the mix. Just every now and then the film catches you off-guard with an unexpectedly startling moment. I also found the story more interesting than I expected to. I'm not sure exactly what the motives were of the villains (unless I missed something it was never explained) but their plan was pretty disturbing nonetheless. I also liked the way the film ended (I won't give it away, but it was my kind of ending). I certainly didn't hate 'Halloween III: Season of the Witch' but it does have some major faults that hold it back unfortunately.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
64,hellraiser7,Masks of Death,10,6 October 2014,"This is another under the radar gem that's both underrated and misunderstood. This film was made at a time when sequels didn't have any rules, to us it usual means a continuation a next chapter in the same story. But this film they decided not to do that at all, they figured after the events of ""Halloween 2"" that the franchise was going to be an anthology series where each year their would be a new film based off of the Halloween season and these films could also be franchises on their own. Personally I think that's an awesome idea, which is why it's a shame it never took off, I honestly felt a great opportunity was lost, think about how many more film non related to Michael Myers we could of had; what a shame.Only problem I have is a certain twist near the end which just came completely out of left field and didn't serve any purpose or make sense to the entire film. Other than that everything else is fine.Anyway this film I think is great, the production value I think is great, this film was done on a modest to low budget and I think it was money well spent and once again proves how limited budget films can produce the best results.I like the use of the enviorment it is just constantly creepy, in a way it's kinda like with the video game series ""Silent Hill"" since that game always take place in a dark small decrepit town. From how run down the town slightly looks, the constant surveillance cameras that are everywhere in the town, to how small and far the place is. It really gives that atmospheric feeling of isolation. Even like the use of the night as well as the color of the sky which at times is red it really helps the atmospheric feeling due to the amount of darkness but just simply created a dark foreboding atmosphere as if there is an evil force about to overwhelm us.The effects are on par, from one really great kill which is seeing someone getting their head ripped off literally and spurting a fountain of blood. Though for me the real highlight was seeing those creepy men in black androids which spurt out mustard blood. They sort of remind me of the cyborgs or even clockwork robots from the TV show ""Doctor Who"" since these things run, not on cyber technology but on clockwork which is I think a different idea on the concept of robots but also makes sense since robots operate based on a complex assortment of parts together and running.The protagonist Daniel Challis solid, I like actor Tom Atkins whom I think is slightly underrated and I think is performance is solid. Not much to say for him, he has a dry charisma, smart, but I like just how doggedly determined he is at finding the truth and putting a stop to the evil plot as well as how well he can handle himself against danger.The antagonist Cochran is great, played well by the late great Dan O Herlihy, he's one of my favorite fictional villains. On the outside he seem like a really nice guy. But of course this is just an act as he is really an evil Druid warlock and the whole corporation he has crated is a front for a Druid witch cult. He can really give you chills because he still has charisma when evil but it's just the amount of coldness and sinisterness that is attached to it. One scene with him that stands out is when he gives a monologue on one of the stories about Halloween which always gives me chills because that's actually a real story.The best things for me about the film are the music which I think is great, most of it is mainly synthesizer music but I think this film makes great use for it and fits perfectly. I like the theme song which is solid but to me it's the end theme song that stands out and is probably one of my favorite themes because it has a mood feel like a sense of urgency and doom.The suspense is great it goes at a good pace, just like Daniel you really feel a sense of isolation and doom, that danger could be at any turn and could attack at any moment. You're intrigued at seeing the protagonist finding out what the heck is going on. Though you are already at least one step ahead of him where we already have some knowledge of the enemies activities; which makes it more suspenseful because were hoping Daniel can somehow put it all together and find a way to thwart the bad guy's plans before it's too late.I really like the story which I think is really creative and a very interesting idea, on turning all the commercialization of the holiday the typical masks and TV against us which is always a common thing in the suspense thriller genre on taking away everything were comfortable with and latching danger onto it. Even like the fact that these evil Druid Witches are using the power of technology to aid their evil magic, which I feel displays the dynamic of both alchemy and science becoming indivisible. It almost feels like something that could be plausible since we always invest a certain amount of trust in companies whenever we purchase certain products and lets face we all watch a certain amount of TV everyday; who says any of the corporate entities don't have a sinister agenda which to me makes the film all the more scary.Overall, I think this is a great sequel that like any Halloween mask is worth trying on and Happy Halloween.Rating: 4 stars",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

Nothing to do with Michael Myers etc. Treated as a stand alone horror film, you've got a daft, weird tale that somehow reminded me of Phantasm. It's actor Tom Atkins versus a Halloween mask producer with a sinister agenda. Look out Atkins – they're Irish! The Silver Shamrock company are mass producing Halloween masks and some old guy escapes from their town clutching a mask. After being rescued by a gas station worker, he ends up in hospital where a guy in a suit turns up a kills him, then self immolates in a car. Doctor Tom Atkins is intrigued enough to find out what's going on (while boozing constantly) and teams up with the dead guy's daughter to head out to the town where Silver Shamrock are based.Needless to say, Atkins and the girl get it on shortly afterwards, and if that had happened to me I would have been all like 'What masks?' and would have spent all my time in that motel. But you know these crazy horror film characters – they've got to meddle where they're not meant to meddle, which leads to all sort of showdowns with the owner of the Silver Shamrock.Expect to see a tramp have his head pulled off by a robot (all of which have yellow blood like the bad guys in Phantasm), a woman get zapped by a corporate logo, and expect to scratch your head regarding all that stuff about Stonehenge.

I guess Carpenter had the grandiose idea of expanding the franchise to one movie released around Halloween that was kind of about Halloween...the holiday not the movies.Mike did die in Halloween II. It was a good idea, one year, one horror movie, all under the same anthology franchise.Except the audience, after two stellar slasher films wanted Mike, so best laid plans of mice and men and all that.What we got instead of Mike was a movie that would have been a halfway decent stand alone end of the 70s horror film, one that was atmospheric, moody, and though it was too flawed to be big, it would have been a fair enough start to the franchise...it would have made a bit of money for the seasonal scare fair.Except....it was called ""Halloween III"" and all the publicity in the world wouldn't have stopped the public from expecting Mike.So, ""robbed"" would be the best phrase to describe how one feels whilst watching this film.Even now after knowing what it was intended to be...still feel a little robbed.

68,Polaris_DiB,"Skip to ""4""",2,3 May 2007,"The first thing you may notice about this film during the opening titles is that neither Jamie Lee Curtis nor Donald Pleasence is in it. This is unusual, considering that either one or both of them are in every other Halloween movie. Then if you pay attention to such things, you may notice that Halloween creator John Carpenter is only around for the score, and that the only person returning from the previous Halloween movies is the producer. The best moment, however, is when you realize fifteen minutes in that Michael isn't even a part of this movie at all.Yes, indeed, Halloween 3 has absolutely NOTHING to do with the previous movies, except its title, music, and a few references to the previous two movies. Now if they had done something like this today, for instance if Saw 4 turned out to be a movie about a man who decides to dress in a gorilla suit and stalk a daycare center, people would be outraged. I guess back in 1982, giving a franchise name to a totally unrelated product was acceptable. Considering that this came out one year after Halloween II, it may just be that Carpenter and his producer liked this already finished work and decided to give it their title so as to give it larger distribution. Or somehow the De Laurentiis company was just being stupid (it's happened before).Okay, so this movie has nothing to do with the other movies. But is it a good movie itself? Well, it has its moments. As in, two of them. There is a nice creepy scene involving a town completely under control of a Halloween-mask creating empire, and there's the neat gore effects of a woman shocked by the, uh, metaphysical killer laser ray bug-creating thing. The rest of the movie is pretty much an old, ungraceful doctor bumbling around making an ass of himself while trying to stop some guy from killing all the children in the world because he's some kind of weird Celtic Pagan or something.

Yes even BEATING John Carpenters 1978 classic HALLOWEEN.What a misunderstood Horror sci-fi CLASSIC this film is.""H3"" is the greatest Halloween themed movie ever in my opinion as the entire film is drenched in Halloween Horror atmosphere & so colourful with all those bright orange pumpkin masks & those green witch masks along with legendary Dean Cundy's Cinematography that makes the colours pop & the shadows menacing.I have such a fondness & Nostalgia for the character Dan Challis because he reminds me so much of my grandad George, he even looks abit like him & had the same hair & mustache & dressed the same so when i watch this Horror Classic i get a nice comfort in seeing Dan Challis on screen oh they are similar even smoking like most blokes did back in the day, similar except for the doctoring & heavy drinking lol but i get a Nostalgic Comfort with Atkins as this everyman retro character.The legendary Tom Atkins is one of the most interesting actors in Cinema history!!!! The guy creates such memorable characters that each has a uniqueness to them & Tom has such a unique screen presence that you can't help but love him & enjoy watching him.From rugged fisherman Nick Castle from The Fog & heavy-drinking Doctor Dan Challis from H3: Season of the Witch & tough Detective Frank Mcrae from Maniac Cop to hilarious Detective Ray Cameron from Night of the Creeps & other Classic roles, it's always Tom's scene stealing performances that grab your attention & makes you want to watch him over & over again. The greatest ""Character Actor"" of all time.Tom Atkins as ""Dr. Dan Challis"" is excellent & one my fave Horror movie characters ever (along with Atkins The Fog character ""Nick Castle"")
Tom Atkins embodies that lost era, the Nostalgic 80's with his iconic mustache, average build & nice mop of hair, ""Atkins"" is the 80's & so is this interesting character"" Dr. Dan Challis"".I really, really wish that ""H3"" took off well & then we would have had that cool Halloween themed Anthology of movies!!! I love that Idea but of course they all wanted the same thing all over again & again, the CRITICS & AUDIENCE was completely WRONG hating on this original ""MASTERPIECE""
We could have had more from the excellent character ""Dan Challis"" (tom atkins) i would have loved that & his own part in a different universe from ""Myers"" which ""H3"" is anyway, but we could have had him turn up in his own franchise of films, or many other new characters could've been introduced with their own spin off films in the Halloween Anthology series? The possibilities are endless, but as we know it all fell apart because of BORING IDIOTS!!!With beautiful cinematography by Dean Cundy & a fantastic pulsing & scary score by Carpenter & a uniquely crafted film by Tommy Lee Wallace, what more could you want in a Horror-Thriller film?""H3"" is one of my most watched ""Horror"" film of all time along with The Fog (1980)
""H3"" is one of favourite Horror movies of all time!!! It sits proudly next Carpenter's The Fog.""H3"" captures the spirit & theme of Halloween better than all the Halloween franchise put together.The tone is eerie,dark,menacing & fun.""H3"" has the best music score that carpenter has ever created!!! Just watch the creepy opening.""H3"" has stunning cinematography by the legendary ""Dean Cundy""
The Atmosphere oozes fear & darkness.The hospital ""dan challis"" chase scene, where he wakes up to screaming & runs through the corridors is truly terrifying & a perfect horror scene.""H3"" is an original & exciting Horror movie in it's own right, with perfect casting in the legend that is TOM ATKINS, a great role that he made fun & gritty at the same time, Tom as Dr. Dan challis is such a fun flawed character that it's a real treat to watch Atkins enjoying this character & rare leading man role, it's actually a nice comfort watching Atkins uncover the sinister conspiracy, i So wish he got more leading roles because he has a great everyman screen presence & makes any movie instantly better by his appearance in it, thats why he has this huge following & fan base & he so deserves this later in life recognition!!! Actors like ""ATKINS"" don't come around often at all i mean he's rugged & naturally tough without living in the gym to look like the Hulk!!! He's a nice guy who comes accross easy going & charming, he's a blue collar kinda guy & that's him in real life too, Atkins is a ""Working Actor"" not a big ""Star"" he often turns up in Horror films & often gets killed off, he's a very good actor & has a huge following of fans especially those who love him in the Horror genre!!!H3 to me is a perfect Halloween movie that drips scary atmosphere mystery & suspense with an extremely uneasy creepy music score by the legend ""Carpenter"" & a really terrifying, sinister & evil plot, that makes this movie that I've loved since childhood on old vhs a true cult classic!!! It used to scare the crap outta me because it's generally dark frightening & atmospheric.This movie proves you don't need ""Michael Myers"" to make a great Halloween themed Horror film!!!Tom Atkins is fantastic & everything else fits perfectly into place to create this one of a kind Halloween Horror, i absolutely love it & watch it every year lots of times, An easy 10/10!!!(A little bit about my love for Tom Atkins & ""Dan Challis"")
I have major love for the excellent TOM ATKINS & especially in ""H3"" as ""Dan Challis"" as he feels like someone you know or knew he just plays that casual cool blue-collar kinda guy perfectly, even down to how he dressed in ""H3"" just like My grandad R. I. P dressed, almost the same with checked shirts & fitted jacket & even the cool manly 80's moustache!!! So i have a fondness & warmth for Atkins in this particular role in ""H3"", he does mean alot to me as an actor & his character ""dan challis"", a great leading man role , he really has that everyman quality that you could meet him just walking down the street!!!""H3"" (1982) is what a true cult classic is all about, a hated on release film, an underrated way under appreciated & misunderstood movie, but it's an excellent Atmospheric Horror Thriller, yes it can seem like a trashy B-movie shocker, but it's so much more, it's actually a layered & ""ORIGINAL"" Horror movie, with very interesting & flawed characters that are ordinary & believable!!! Pure magic in my opinion.So many perfect elements came together to create this crazy Horror Thriller that definitely ""Thrilled Me""
What ""H3"" has is re-watchable charm, it's full of crazy characters, a doomed atmosphere, moody cinematography, an excellent creepy musical score & a fun & scary story!!!Also i have to add it's gory as hell with some of the most savage deaths I've ever seen in any horror movie!!!""Stacey Nelkin"" is very good & has nice chemistry with ""Challis"" in her role as ""Ellie Grimbridge"" she's fun to watch teamed up with rugged ""Tom Atkins"", they seem to work perfectly together with a nice natural chemistry!!!We also have one of the scariest & most sinister villans in horror history ""Conal Cochrane"" played with a real sinister charm by ""Dan O'herlihy"" a veteran actor i knew from ""Robocop 1&2"" this Horror ""Gem"" has a nice little cast of quality actors to help lift this to real ""Classic"" movie material in my opinion.The fx are excellent too, very savage, gruesome & disturbing with heads melting, heads pulled off & skulls crushed, all sorts of bloody evil killings.Again EXCELLENT cinematography & a terrifying raw pulse pounding electronic synth score, it's excellent & the creepy ending is scary & shocking, this is how you make a Horror movie, full of intense & moody scenes that ooze dark atmosphere, there's so much great stuff in here for Horror fans!!!I remember Tom Atkins in the background alot when i was young & growing up as my mum would often have ""The Fog"" or ""Halloween 3"" playing on old VIDEO, so this cool serious looking & sometimes panicky rugged guy with a moustache was kinda always around & his face became iconic to me even though i didn't know his name!!!I grew up watching the ""Lethal weapon"" movies & of course Atkins appeared in the very first 1987 classic so again this rugged,older, silver fox guy with an 80's moustache was always there, & fed my Nostalgia just seeing his face, so i became a huge fan of this cool guy that appeared tough enough to handle himself but was nothing like the usual ""80's"" actors such like ""Schwarzenegger"" or ""Stallone"" (yes I'm a fan of both).I recognised Tom Atkins face from the very old vhs my mum had of H3 way bk in the early 90's & just that old cover art of a faint witch face used to scare me when i was little & on the back was a small pic of Dan Challis & those images have stuck with me all my life so in a way i i knew of Tom Atkins before i even knew who he was by name. Nostalgia love.H3 is just a great Horror time of a movie, alot don't like it but i love it, i never listen to critics anyway, as i say you like what you like!!!",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
74,drownnnsoda,Grim psychotronic horror film,7,30 October 2017,"In northern California, a doctor teams up with a young woman to investigate a series of deaths occurring that seem to be linked to a mysterious corporation selling Halloween masks to young children. Their revelations, however, are far more sinister than imagined.This notorious botched departure from the Michael Myers plot of ""Halloween"" and ""Halloween II"" has been panned by many and defended by a few. I saw the film years ago and could not commit myself to it because of its ""black sheep"" role in the series, but in the context of what the filmmakers were attempting to do with the series, it's easier for me now to understand the aim. In the context of how the series went on, however (bringing back Myers for ""Part 4""), the film suffers greatly.The plot of the film is admittedly wonky and perhaps its utter strangeness made it even more alienating to audiences. There is a strange sci-fi bent to it all somewhere in the crosshairs of technology and the supernatural. As unusual as it is, there are some fun special effects and flashy splatter sequences that are as inventive as they are bizarre. The involvement of the children in the narrative makes it an unexpectedly dark film at its core, which is at times at odds with its slick sheen.Atmospherically, the film looks and feels quite similar to ""Halloween II""-perhaps not surprising given the director is Tommy Lee Wallace, Carpenter's protégé, and there is a lot of the same crew involved, but it does give the film something of a through-line in terms of mood and aesthetic choices. The performances here are decent and the script is relatively well-handled, save an obligatory (and kind of absurd, albeit subdued) romance subplot, and the finale is playful, closing on a grim note.In the end, I've found that I have warmed up to ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" over the years. As a psychotronic seasonal-themed horror romp, it's quite fun and reasonably well-made. It's also admittedly ridiculous in many regards, but not necessarily to its own detriment. As a followup to the previous two films, it does pale in comparison, and perhaps alienates a great deal of its audience for being too far out on the fringe (to say it ""does something different"" may be a bit of an understatement). Though certainly not perfect, it is a film that I think is ultimately doomed by its context more than its content. For me, it works as a zany mystery flick as much as it does a reminder of why Michael Myers made such a great screen villain in the first place. Best moment: The montage of children in cities across America donning their Shamrock masks. 7/10.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

76,Witchfinder-General-666,Happy Happy Halloween - Silver Shamrock... Happy Happy Halloween - Silver Sha...,5,19 June 2008,"""Halloween III: Season Of The Witch"" is arguably the most widely hated 'sequel' to the ""Halloween"" series, and it is obvious why. Movie psycho Michael Myers does not appear, neither does Laurie Strode or Dr. Sam Loomis, and the film has absolutely nada to do with the rest of the series (except that it takes place on Halloween) . Also, it must have one of the silliest story lines ever, and the film is extremely cheesy from the beginning to the end. Yet, I found this film to be highly entertaining. It may have absolutely no right to masquerade as a Halloween-sequel, but it certainly won't leave its viewers bored. While the film is not even nearly as suspenseful or creepy as its predecessors, it has a bizarrely entertaining general atmosphere.***Small SPOILERS***The film does not revolve around a psycho with a passion for slaughtering pretty teenage girls, but a sinister toy company and its devilish Halloween masks. A man is brought to Hospital, screaming that 'they are going to kill us'. Shortly later, he is murdered in his hospital bed by an assailant who subsequently blows himself up in his car. Alnog with the murdered man's daughter (Stacey Nelkin), Dr Dan Challis (Tom Atkins) gets deeper into the case, and they soon suspect the popular Halloween-mask company 'Silver Shamrock' to be behind what has happened. And the company lead by the eccentric Mr Cochran (Dan O'Herlihy) has evil plans indeed... Sounds cheesy, and it is! With all the silliness and cheese in it, the film is great fun to watch. Leading man Tom Atkins certainly isn't a good actor, but he somehow fits his role (of a mustached macho-doctor) extremely well. Stacey Nelkin is very nice to look at in the female lead, and Dan O'Herlihy is well-cast as the villainous Halloween-mask-maker Cochran. A Song in a TV-Commercial for the ""Silver Shamrock"" company is repeated endlessly throughout the film. For the first half hour I thought it was the most annoying thing I ever heard, but when the credits rolled I had gotten so used to it that I couldn't get it out of my head for the rest of the night. All said, ""Halloween III"" has nothing at all to do with the rest of the Halloween franchise, and it sure is an immensely cheesy flick. As silly as it may be, it is actually great fun to watch and a recommendable time-waster. I enjoyed it.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
77,aidanratesmovies,Guilty Pleasure Fun,7,21 November 2020,"I know I shouldn't enjoy this film as much as I did, but even though Halloween III can be messy, poorly acted, and certainly campy at times- the film is very fun to watch, and proves to be an entertaining adventure that keeps you wanting more until the end. The performances throughout the film mostly very from okay to bad to worse. Dan O'Herlihy I would say provides the best performance of the bunch, being the antagonist, and the plot surrounding him is quite interesting and creepy. The concept of this film is very interesting, and I love all the thought into it. It feels a lot more psychological than the other Halloween films, obviously it's very different without Michael Myers and such, but it also has a very different and unique feel which I enjoyed. The direction feels a bit sloppy, a feel that if someone more motivated with a sharper aspect on filmmaking could have made this a truly sharper film, but sadly it's direction ends up a bit muttled, making the film a bit comical at times when it isn't trying to be. I enjoyed the look of the film very much, I loved the atmosphere, and I loved the Silver Shamrock masks- as well as the song that goes with it. In the end, Halloween III is nothing great or grand, but it's a unique twist of genres for the franchise, and a certainly enjoyable and watchable entry that makes for a quite compelling storyline .
My Rating: 7/10",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
78,truemythmedia,The Black Sheep of the Halloween Franchise,5,31 October 2019,"This film has somewhat of a reputation surrounding it, so I was sort of looking forward to my viewing. ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" is the only ""Halloween"" sans the famous masked psychopath Michael Meyers. Since Michael Meyers 'dies' at the end of ""Halloween II"" (only to be resurrected in ""Halloween: The Return of Michael Meyers""), John Carpenter's plan was to produce a new Halloween themed movie every year, and this film was to be the first film to kick off that new wave of anthology Halloween movies. This movie apparently didn't do at that well at the box office, so Carpenter's plans for an anthology series were scrapped, and ""Halloween 4"" featured Mikey once more.Since I knew all that backstory going into this viewing, I knew I wasn't one of the people that was going to be disappointed by that lack of Mike; I was more curious to see where the series would've headed had Carpenter been able to take it in the direction he wanted (note- he has only producer and music credits on this, but he would've been the one to choose the stories to produce each year). As the story got started, I immediately found myself noticing a drop in quality between the first two films in the series. While the second film's directing style (and even the story) was noticeably less impressive than that in the first film, this third film seemed like it would've been passable as a Sci-Fi channel movie of the week. The acting is all around pretty horrible; the dialogue is stilted and uncomfortable; and the story is predictable. The only saving graces that this film boasts are some of the practical effects and it has a few cool ideas; the only problem is it doesn't know how to execute those ideas very well. As a ""Halloween"" movie, I don't think this really works, and as a standalone film, aside from a few moments, I feel pretty apathetic towards it. I suppose if you're a franchise completionist then you should see this, but I would have a hard time recommending it to anyone just on a whim. It feels too much like a cheap made for TV movie for me to really take it seriously.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
79,a_chinn,"No Michael Meyers, but good horror fun",6,9 May 2017,"John Carptenter's frequent collaborator Tommy Lee Wallace wrote and directed this non-Michel Meyers Halloween sequel that's more of an ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" type of story than slasher film. Carpenter regular Tom Atkins plays a man investigating a mysterious Halloween costume company run by evil scientist Dan O'Herlihy. The film does have a bit slower of pace than I'd have liked, but I did like the creepy company town vibe that's nicely oppressive. This was the last film that involved producers John Carpenter and Debra Hill, who also did uncredited rewrites. Carpenter and Alan Howarth provided the film's score, so this film still feels consistent with the first two films, even if the story is a drastic departure. Although fans did not like this film at the time of it's release and it had poor box office, I've always liked this oddball entry into the Halloween series and wish there might have been further non-Michel Meyer Halloween films by Carpenter and company.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
80,Reviews_of_the_Dead,Underrated Entry into the Franchise,9,16 March 2019,"This is an interesting film for me. I remember one October Directv doing a promo where you could purchase on pay-per-view old horror films for really cheap. My dad caved to my sister and I so we checked out this film. The problem though, we didn't really care for it as we really wanted Michael Myers. Like many horror fans, the older I've gotten the more I really appreciate this film and realize, this is actually one of the best in the series. The synopsis is kids all over America want Silver Shamrock masks for Halloween. Doctor Daniel Challis (Tom Atkins) seeks to uncover a plot by Silver Shamrock owner Conal Cochran (Dan O'Herlihy).We kick off with Harry Grimbridge (Al Berry) as he is fleeing from someone. He gets attacked and the person is very strong. He is able to escape by pulling a block free and a car rolling into his attacker, pinning him to another vehicle. He ends up at a gas station where the man working takes him to the hospital.It is here that he meets Dr. Challis. Harry wakes up and freaks when hearing the catchy Silver Shamrock commercials. He is giving a sedative. That night though, another attacker who looks like the previous one kills him in his sleep. Dr. Challis is trying to sleep when it happens and the screams of a nurse wake him up. He follows the attacker outside to watch him burn himself alive.The next day Dr. Challis meets the daughter of the patient, Ellie (Stacey Nelkin). She is determined to figure out what happened to her father, which Dr. Challis is as well. Much to the anger of his ex-wife, Linda (Nancy Kyes), Dr. Challis runs off with Ellie to Santa Mira, the home of Silver Shamrock to look into what is going on. This leads them to a town that is ran by the company and its odd owner, Conal Cochran. Things aren't as they seem and neither are his henchmen as they figure out what happened to Ellie's father and what their real plans.Clearly this film feels out of place now, but in reality creator John Carpenter really wanted to make Halloween actually into an anthology series, where each year would be a different film with its own story. Even though I didn't like this film as a child, I have definitely come around to it as an adult.Knowing how this film plays out, the structure is actually well done. Being that Conal is an Irishman and the town that he resides in being an Irish town as well, I like that incorporate Stonehedge into this film. On top of that, I never noticed that there's a new story on television in the very beginning talking about a stone being stolen from it. I don't find it plausible to move it across the ocean to California, but I will let that slide. I will give them credit to hearken back to something like this in the film. That's just good writing.It also has a weird way to kill people though, with these masks. I really like the concept though and it is actually very mean-spirited, as they are targeting kids. Something that struck me during the 'test' that is done on Buddy Kupfer (Ralph Strait) and his family, that it is targeting more of that, but I like that we never really get a reason why, aside from Stonehedge was used for sacrifices. The use of the robots is also interesting and believable enough. A lot of this goes to their acting, as they show no emotion as well.The pacing of the film is really good. It has a normal running time and it never really falls into a lull in my opinion. I think that we get enough information as we go along so the deaths and this are really enough to hold your attention. I love the ending even though there are some issues. The first is that if they are doing this at 9 PM PST, which would make it midnight on the east coast. On top of that, when Dr. Challis is trying to get take down the feed, but I don't think it works that way. One call to get it off all channels, but the 1980's was a different time. It does give us a great last shot.Acting for this film was really good as well. Atkins is great and this film he is at his best. He's such a jerk and really neglectful to his family. It is hard to completely hate him, because of what he uncovers. I can see why he is divorced and his children are really the ones suffering, while he drinks too much and runs off with a much younger woman. I thought Nelkin was solid. I can't fault her for wanting to find out what happened to her dad and she seems a bit too impulsive. O'Herlihy, is such a villain and I thought he played the role very well. It was fun to see Kyes and hearing the voice of Jamie Lee Curtis, both from the original Halloween. The rest of the cast round out the film for exactly what they needed.The effects for this film were also really good. I think part of that is due to the era that the film came out, where everything was done practical. This one though doesn't actually have a lot of effects in it. Killing some of the henchmen I thought was interesting. We do get some not great effects when it comes to energy from the masks and what is causing it. I didn't really mind this. Overall I'd say the effects we get are solid.Last thing I cover before wrapping this up would be the soundtrack of the film. Carpenter teams up with Alan Howarth and we get a great score. The musical cues in the film match up with things on screen and it is effective. This is actually a soundtrack I turn to when writing at times, which is something that is really impressive about this. One of the best parts of the film and really helps the overall atmosphere.With that said, my rating is much higher than the first time I reviewed this film and it really is a film that keeps going up every time I see it. I think the overall story and tying in with history is really good. There are some missteps with the story, but that doesn't really bother me. The acting is good and even though Dr. Challis is a scumbag, he is still great to me. The effects are solid and the pacing is good. The score is one of the best parts of the film and it really helps set the tone. This is a film that I've grown to really like and it is really good in my opinion. Would recommend just giving this a watch and ignoring that is part of a series that is somewhat meta actually.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
81,breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,An interesting concept with poor writing,5,13 July 2014,"For aficionados of the Halloween franchise, it is a known fact that Halloween II (1981) was supposed to be end for the character of Michael Myers. After the explosion in the hospital, that was it. Myers was no longer relevant. John Carpenter's plan after that was to create a franchise based on the holiday of Halloween, not Michael Myers. This is the reason why this sequel although related to the franchise has nothing to do with Laurie Strode, Dr. Loomis or Michael Myers. These particular characters were never intended to have a continued story. Because of this reason alone, it is obvious to why the film performed poorly and had fans turning their heads. The surprising thing is, is that it's not the concept that didn't work. It was practically everything else.Instead of the story revolving around a serial killer, the focus changes to that of a much bigger scale. Dr. Challis (Tom Atkins) comes across a strange case where a patient is killed in his hospital over what seems to be a regular halloween mask. In order to understand why his patient was killed, he teams up with the patients daughter Ellie (Stacey Nelkin), to find out the problem. The mask that Atkins finds, brings them to the factory that makes the rest, headed by Conal Cochran (Dan O'Herlihy - most notable for his role as ""the old man"" in RoboCop (1987)). The rest of the cast is completely forgettable. As for these three actors, they do their best but the problem is that their acting can't save them from either sounding or being extremely silly on screen.Tommy Lee Wallace (better known for directing Stephen Kings It (1990)) wrote and directed for his first time in this picture. Unfortunately, it's quite apparent that Wallace's experience isn't polished because there are a number of things that don't work in its screenplay. Characterization is one. Tom Atkins is a respectable actor, yet his character and his Nelkin's character are written with little development. Dr. Challis' motivations are extremely confused when it comes to women. He has a wife and kids, flirts with his nurse, dates a coroner and makes out with the patients daughter. Is he really that careless and sleezy? Why exactly is he like that? Cochran's motivations are explained but don't make much sense either.A lot of the dialog is also forgettable and awkward at times too. This takes away much of the tension that the story tries to build up, which isn't good. Then there's these robots that are lead by Cochran. It is never explained to how they are made or how they exist. They're literally just there to add creepiness and that's not even fully exploited. Even stranger is that this movie continuously makes references to the last two Halloween movies. Wallace films Cochran's robots like they were Michael Myers due to their stiff poses. Clips are randomly played and even Jamie Lee Curtis plays an uncredited voice in the film. If you listen carefully, you might be able to tell when she speaks. Nevertheless, why do this? All this does is remind its viewer what either they could be watching or reminding them that this isn't that movie. Either way, it only distracts.Thankfully, there are some redeeming qualities, which don't make impossible to sit through. The special effects are noteworthy for when they are on screen. For example, the intro credits basically digitizes that of the first two Halloween films, which was different and creative. The gore scenes were relatively new as well. Not all of them make sense because of how they're connected to the plot, but it still can be enjoyed. The element that worked the best was John Carpenter's score to the film. There wasn't a main theme this time but that's appropriate since Michael Myers isn't in it either. The intro track strangely sounds like Brad Fiedel first terminator score. But with that are other tracks that sound creepy, which work. Sadly this isn't enough to make it entirely compelling. I wanted to favor it but it lacked a lot.It has good music, decent effects, respectable actors and an interesting concept but its writing is so flawed in its execution. The characterizations, motivations and plot are very flimsy.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
82,alexanderdavies-99382,"In itself, not too bad.",6,23 October 2018,"Although this film has absolutely nothing to do with Michael Myers or Dr. Loomis, ""Halloween 3: Season of the Witch"" still has some effective scenes. There is a fairly strong sense of atmosphere and tension throughout. A feeling of impending doom comes to mind, especially with Tom Atkins trying to solve the mystery of those creepy Halloween masks. There's a nasty moment which takes place in the hospital - even though the B.B.F.C still won't allow the scene to be shown uncensored. I still vaguely recall seeing a clip of the part when the two kids wear their own masks at home, by the T.V.

It's a cult classic and should be the film that everyone watches every 31st October. There is no horror film like it. The originality and the cleverness of the whole production make it very special; from the opening credits - the pumpkin and the desperate escape; the chronology of the story captioned on screen; the haunting advert jingle; the whole Autumnal Halloween atmosphere captured; the almost undiscovered Irish community which hides something so very sinister; the Halloween cameos and references; to Dan O'Hilerhy's sublime portrayal of the dark, calm satanist who just seems to exude evil without doing very much at all with just a smirk, a look or a gesture. There are moments where you could pick holes in it at leisure but it'd be difficult to top ""Halloween III"" for innovation, originality and atmosphere. Pure Halloween magic.'Halloween III: Season of the Witch' was never meant to include the psychologically-disturbed menace of suburban America. Tommy Lee Wallace in his first attempt at directing a feature film - wanted to avoid another 'slasher' sequel and instead concentrated on exploring the domestic roots of Halloween and its relationship to Celtic folklore. 'Season of the Witch' boasts originality and examines the real legend of Halloween, the Festival of Samhain. John Carpenter produced and wrote the score for Halloween III: Season of the Witch, and it is good to see that the director of the first film (arguably the best horror movie ever directed) was involved in the project. The film has all the look and feel of a classic John Carpenter movie; atmospheric, claustrophobic, dark and eerie, it is both quite fascinating and genuinely disturbing at the same time.

84,Sandcooler,"It's a movie about evil masks, what can I say?",2,2 November 2009,"""Season Of the Witch"" is pretty much the deadbeat uncle of the ""Halloween"" family. You can't deny its existence, but you can sure as hell ignore it. Is that the right thing to do? Yeah, I'd say so, because it's just a very bad movie no matter how you look at it. The problem's not even that it doesn't involve Michael Myers, the problem is that it just really sucks balls. It's essentially a children's movie, only they edited in some gore scenes to make people believe it's all gruesome horror. A heartless tycoon wanting to cause mayhem on Halloween using magical masks (his factory makes no less than THREE different masks, and every kid in America wears them) should not exist outside of cartoons, and even then. The excruciatingly childish story really doesn't mix well with all the severed limbs. The subplot about our hero trying to solve a murder case isn't particularly good either, mainly because to him solving a murder consists mostly of screwing the victim's barely legal daughter. What a guy. The makers still weren't sure they had annoyed every person in the audience yet, so they also put in a terrible non-ending just to be on the safe side. This movie just really needed its false advertising.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
85,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,"Amusing to watch, only for its cast and preposterousness.",4,5 November 2013,"The film is played completely straight, despite its lunacy. A five ton block from Stonehenge is stolen (!) by an Irish Halloween mask manufacturer in America, who breaks bits from it and implants them in Halloween masks to kills those wearing them (!!) so they can be sacrificed and replaced by robots (!!!) One of the most preposterous, illogical horrors ever made, this coasts along thanks to the good casting of Tom Atkins, and Stacey Nelkin; and Dan O'Herlihy as a successfully evil villain with a ridiculous plan for mayhem, and unintentional laughs.If the film had been released under a different title, and Halloween fans weren't expecting to see The Shape return yet again, it would not have been as much of a disappointment to them, and people might have been able to have a laugh at its lunacy.Starts as a mystery: a man, clutching a Halloween mask, being chased by men in suits, repeatedly whispering ""They're going to kill us all,"" before Stongehenge, doppelgangers, computer chips embedded in Halloween masks, robots, sacrifices to Druid gods, and an obnoxious jingle all come along and confuse the hell out of everyone watching. Unrelated ideas put into a blender, the result is this story.But is the plan to kill millions of people successful, or is the hero able to stop it? Or, was there not intended to be a sacrifice, and the entire plot only a Halloween prank? The slasher genre may have been done to death (pun totally intended) by this is most certainly one of the most original, unique horrors ever done.

86,vengeance20,The Weakest Entry!,3,13 October 2021,"Knew from watching the first time years back that this entry didn't involve the masked killer, Michael Myers. But still, I watched it anyway & have seen it again for the first time in over 8 years & still have the same opinion.The film this time around, features a mask making company designed to kill kids on Halloween via a TV Advert Jingle used to trance them to death on Halloween Night. It's a race against time for one man to stop this trance before it's too late.I found the film to be poor, sorry not sorry but it was & not because it didn't feature Michael Myers. Now, I'm not one of those guys who dislikes the film because of that reason. The film itself was poor & even if it didn't share the same title I don't think it would've fared better, that's a matter of opinion. There's a lot of people think that the film would've been better received had the films title been different. I don't think so & that's a tunnel vision, rose tinted, myth that can never be proven. There's no solid fact that the film would've been better.I for one know of the backstory behind what John Carpenter & Debra Hill were trying to do. The Halloween Franchise was supposed to be a bigger scale analogy like The Twilight Zone as John put it, but the success of the first film & the sequel had other ideas & as a result the film was put down, yeah, the film MAY have been better received but would have been better received any more than what we see or if at all.I didn't like this film because the story sucked. The action was below mediocre & the whole premise was dumb & plot holed. Even if the film had been named Season Of The Witch & wasn't part of the Franchise I still wouldn't have liked it. In fact, I wouldn't have even bothered watching had it not been ""apart"" of the Halloween Franchise (sharing the same name).There's not a lot in terms of redeeming qualities. The idea was unique & different but that's about it, well, that & the tad bit of eye candy we get. But to be honest, it's hard to find & think of anything I liked with this film as it wasn't great.Overall, it's a disappointment & that's not because of Michael, sure I'd say it is a bit, but I generally think in itself, the film to be poor as.3/10.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
87,screenman,The witch is worth a watch.,6,18 March 2006,"I am not a dedicated horror-movie fan in the way that some people are. To me, a good film is a good film - no matter what the subject.The original Halloween movies belong to that teenage-horror genre that have been putting adolescent bums on seats and provoking hugs and gropes in the back-row since the 1950's. Generally; they're B-movies, rather amateurish, and not my scene.For this reason I found halloweens 1 & 2 repetitive and boring - just like the Freddy Kruger 'Nightmare' hokum. How many kids does one really need to see being systematically disembowelled with a sharp knife? There's no plot to such movies, you don't need to think; it is just set-piece slash after set-piece slash. All the more absurd is the seeming invulnerability of the assailants. Michael Myers is no exception. Why are these slashers always supernatural? Thank heavens for jolly old Mr Lecter.Sadly, lots of people seem to be turned-on by serial slaughter, and the absence from Halloween 3 of Mr Myers and his tedious, predictable butchery caused indignant outrage amongst those gore-fans who made the originals such a success. 'Season Of The Witch' apparently bombed at the box office. Well; more fool the Myerettes. This third Halloween actually has a lot more going for it. For one thing; there's a story. It builds-up gradually with some unexpected twists. The plot is entirely much darker, concerning some evil genius who threatens unspeakable mischief to American children (I liked him immediately!). Effects and shocks are spooky and original. The hospital assassin who practically tears someone's head off, and then runs away only to immolate himself was particularly unexpected, as was the imaginative use of creepy-crawlies. Employing child-victims is something of a Hollywood taboo - even in 'Aliens' the little girl is sacrosanct. But Mr Carpenter is never afraid to dispatch children violently in order to make a point: check-out the tiresome ice-cream-demanding brat in his 'Assault On Precinct 13'.The script isn't anything to write home about. The acting is about his usual, rather wooden, standard. And there are no 'stars' to speak of. I won't disclose any more details because that would spoil the surprise.Nevertheless it certainly didn't deserve the caning it got from the slashionistas. Sure; it's still a B movie, It's a million miles from his classic 'The Thing', but it's a worthy little item even so. If you like suspense, a creepy little plot, and some rather grisly ideas, give it an airing. There are far worse ways to spend 90 minutes of your life.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
88,begob,Unhenged,2,15 September 2015,"An alcoholic doctor finds his mystery patient murdered by a be-suited weirdo, so he teams up with the victim's daughter to investigate malevolent goings-on at a toy factory.This is supposed to be different and, judging by the cover art, I expected something atmospheric and creepy. But it feels like a mash up of Willy Wonka and a campy James Bond super-villain extravaganza. With some cheap late '60s ""messin' with your mind"" effects. I guess if you can take anything from it, there's a sense of anxiety over fascism, where the corporation and the state conspire to snuff out individual liberty under a system of total surveillance. Seriously.Really flat style, needing preposterous plot developments to weird it up, even as the dash to save the day plays out like a Hardy Boys episode with extra violence. After the escape from the factory, the final sequence is just daft.Characterisation is really poor too. The hero is an alcoholic. His ex-wife is a harpy. His sidekick makes love to him out of the blue. The baddies are Oirish – because that makes the mystical connection plausible – who but the Irish would steal a piece of Stonehenge? Bleedin' obvious! So it's down to bad direction and writing. Can't say much about the actors – I wouldn't want to be judged by this work either. And Carpenter's music deserved better.Overall, just No. IMDb reviewers insist this is not as bad as it really is, but I guess they're nostalgics who saw it on the big screen when they were kids.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

No doubt there's some small-budget Z movie out there that has done the same thing, but the concepts here are fairly original.  Dan O'Herlihy is likable enough as the twisted toymaker.  There are a few weak spots:  Tom Akins rivals Ted Levine in ""The Mangler,"" as most unlikeable horror movie/lead actor of all time.

91,TedStixonAKAMaximumMadness,"""Halloween III: Season of the Witch""- The one that isn't about Michael Myers! An entertaining but ridiculous anthology piece.",5,25 October 2016,"In many film franchises, there's always that one odd man out. The single oddball entry that has virtually no relation to all of the others. Whether it be because it changed the structure, swapped out the villain for a new baddie or a hero for a new protagonist... or even just added the name of a franchise to an unrelated film in order to turn a profit... weird, one-off sequels are fairly common. With the ""Friday the 13th"" films, it was ""A New Beginning."" With the ""Blair Witch"" saga, there was ""Book of Shadows."" With ""The Fast and the Furious"" franchise, there was ""Tokyo Drift."" And of course (and most notably), when it comes to the classic ""Halloween"" series created by John Carpenter, there's ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch.""Produced by series creators Carpenter and Debra Hill, and under the guidance of director Tommy Lee Wallace, ""Halloween III"" was a conscious attempt to try and distance itself from prior entries. The ultimate goal being to re-brand the series and re- introduce it as a franchise of anthology films, with a new one to be released yearly around Halloween. Each new chapter focusing on a brand-new story involving the festive season of ghosts, ghouls and trick-of- treaters.However, by the time this came to pass, something had become very clear: Audiences were hooked on masked madman Michael Myers. And no matter the intentions of this unrelated follow-up, film- goers were just not going to accept the idea of future sequels abandoning the story so wonderfully started in the original. And thus reaction tended to lean towards apathetic at best and venomous at worst. People didn't want a NEW ""Halloween"", and producers soon enough sought to remedy this with five Myers-centric sequels that followed. And so, as it stands, ""Season of the Witch"" is little more than a curious footnote in the series. A failed experiment that just couldn't connect with audiences the way other entries had.But how does the film stand on its own? Was it a journey worth going on? A chance worth taking? The answer is both yes and no. At its core, ""Season of the Witch"" is a fascinating and wildly insane Sci- Fi thriller that has a lot of entertaining, off-the-wall ideas it tries to explore. And it is most certainly a fun, breezy watch thanks to likable performances and solid visual direction. But it's also very uneven and a little too ""out there."" It probably was not the best first step out of the gate in an effort to transform the series. It's so conflicting with the tonality of previous films, that it just sticks out like a sore thumb. And it does occasionally fall apart under the contrivances and convolution of its unique storyline.Tom Atkins stars as Dr. Dan Challis, a man with a troubled home-life who is pulled into a twisted investigation by the beautiful Ellie (Stacey Nelkin), whose father was murdered inside of the same hospital where Challis works. They learn that her father had some sort of dealing with the massive Halloween mask manufacture ""Silver Shamrock""- a mysterious company headed by the delightfully twisted Cochran. (Dan O'Herlihy) It soon becomes apparent that Cochran's factory is not what it seems, and that there is a dark and devious plan afoot involving the masks he is selling to children... a deadly plan that Challis and Ellie must stop at all costs!The performances are probably the single best aspect of the film. Atkins makes for a charismatic and highly likable lead that also has just enough of a slimy side that you can identify with him. He's an unofficial king in the world of B-movies, and this is one of his more memorable roles. He's cool and collected... but also kind of a jerk. His whole motivation seems to be the fact he just wants to get Ellie in bed, after all! It's a refreshing take on the sort-of modern perfect ""hero"" we see all too often. Nelkin is a very fun co-star, and although she does come off as under- developed, you care just enough about her to want to see her come out on top. But O'Herlihy steals the show here. He's just so easily and wonderfully unlikable, and you can tell he's eating this role up with glee. Such a great villain, despite admittedly having limited screen time.I was also particularly taken by Tommy Lee Wallace's generally strong and competent visual guidance of the film, which is perfectly accentuated by an original score from John Carpenter. Wallace (who also co-writes) does a splendid job here. He has a touch of the tonality seen in previous chapters, but also gives the film a slightly more action-packed style. It works well for the sort-of crazy storyline being presented. Save of course for one hilariously bad montage sequence in which we're supposed to be seeing kids from all over the country... but was clearly all shot in the same neighborhood.However, despite the great performances and quality direction, this film is otherwise a bit of a mess. The grand storyline that is revealed throughout (which I haven't spoiled) becomes so convoluted and ridiculous in the final act that despite having a fun time following these characters, you'll be rolling your eyes with every bit of exposition. And the film does occasionally just completely implode here and there for a scene as a result. It's also features a very problematic climax that will leave you scratching your head and murmuring ""What?"" to yourself quite a few times. And occasionally a few scenes do feel a bit out of place and superfluous.That being said, it's still a fun watch because of these characters and also... because it's so stupid, you can't help but enjoy it. Is it good? No! Not at all. But is it entertaining? Most certainly.And so I give ""Halloween III"" a middle-of-the-road 5 out of 10.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
92,MartianOctocretr5,"Sufficiently sinister premise, but poorly executed",3,25 October 2006,"Halloween 3? No Michael Myers. No Donald Pleasance, either. The premise really isn't bad for a sinister ""Boo; I betcha I scared you ha ha!"" story, but it's not developed well at all.The title is misleading, implying this was another chapter in the Myers saga, an obvious deceit designed to increase box office. The idea of the plot here actually had some creativity, and should have been given some other title; it should stand on its own. Mentioning witches in the title is misleading, too. The plot is so shaky and meandering that it's not clear who the conspirators are: Aliens? Lunatics? Commies? Witches? Robots? Disgruntled toy makers? Santa Claus? The second shooter from the grassy knoll? Whatever the motive for the diabolical plot was is never explained. I was able to identify one co-conspirator, though: the theater that took my money.The plot to kill thousands of people with an evil device on Halloween night could have been utilized so much better than this. However, the movie just doesn't make it possible to suspend disbelief enough to evoke any frights. When you're not being driven mad by that incessant Silver Shamrocks jingle, you're seeing some unlikely scenarios involving the main characters. The bad guys have to be the stupidest clowns to ever try to wipe out people. One scene involving the hero and the bad guys is so cliché: instead of killing the guy when they have the chance...oh, never mind, it's too ridiculous.A few random scenes have the potential to be scary, but they're scattered by all the lame stuff in between. The result is a film that limps toward the end, and you really don't care about the outcome.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

This was a pretty enjoyable commentary -- not the best, but a must-listen for any die-hard fans of Halloween III. I actually thought I'd listened to this already but apparently not. Tommy Lee Wallace is a very laid back guy, so having moderators to ask him questions and keep him on track was a great choice.While the commentary played, I went on Google streetview in Loleta, California and explored the filming locations for Santa Mira as best I could for someone who lives on the opposite side of the country. Man, what a weird little town. The little motel huts where Stacy Nelkin and Tom Atkins seek shelter are actually little apartments now, and on streetview they're currently donning Halloween decorations. Neat!The factory has seen better days. A lot of the windows have been busted out and the garage doors (which were near-immaculate in the film) have begun to partially rot away. Fun fact: the ""Silver Shamrock Novelties"" factory was actually a dairy factory during its operational days.Believe it or not, the downtown area (with the large, white bank building with tall pillars) looks almost exactly the same. Unfortunately, it seems that most of the businesses have since left. Even the bank appears to have left. The small store next to it, which I believe is a grocery store, is still going strong.The building which sported a ""DUBLIN INN"" sign, seen as Tom and Stacy are first arriving into town, appears to have been since torn down. Tall hedges have been planted in its place.If you're a big fan of this movie like I am, I can't recommend exploring Loleta, California via Google streetview enough! Revisiting these locations while listening to TLW discuss his time on set was a blast!I'll be listening to the Tom Atkins commentary very soon.***10/1/21: Listened to the audio commentary with the legendary Tom Atkins! The moderator here did a FANTASTIC job with the questions. If you're a fan of Tom, you absolutely owe it to yourself to listen to this commentary. Him talking about his time working on this film is great, but what shines here is him talking about the breadth of his career, from small television roles to the cult horror films and the gargantuan Lethal Weapon.Never a dull moment in this commentary.

After a mysterious murder at a hospital (a guy has his nose ripped out of socket!), Tom Atkins and Stacy Nelkin go to a small town to investigate ""Silver Shamrocks"", a company mass-producing popular Halloween masks. The cheerful company owner (played by Dan O'Herlihy) is actually using the masks in a ludicrous plot to kill millions of children. In one scene a kid wearing a mask watches a hypnotic commercial, his head melts and hundreds of beetles, cockroaches and snakes come crawling out. Robotic guards are around too, to do things like drill a hole in a woman's face and rip a bums head off. Eventually, a news program tells us that a piece of Stonehenge is missing (!?!) and our heroes find it in the factory with lab technicians chipping away pieces of it to put in the masks! This utterly ridiculous and mean-spirited thing manages to move along nicely thanks to lots of gross Tom Burman FX, good photography by Dean Cundey (later a trusted cinematographer used by Spielberg, Zemeckis and Ron Howard) and an excellent score from Alan Howarth and John Carpenter (who also produced with Debra Hill).",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
95,Pumpkin_Man,A Worthy HALLOWEEN Sequel!!!,10,19 September 2008,"I love Halloween III. People just hate it, because Michael Myers is not in it...SO WHAT!!! A little temporary change never hurts anyone. I love the storyline with the warlock named Cochran making Halloween masks out of Stonehenge. I love the ""Happy happy Halloween"" song and Cochran's speech to Dan about the Celts and how Halloween was 3,000 years ago. I really appreciate this ""sequel"" yes, I called it a sequel, because it's called Halloween 3. Another part I love is what happens to Little Buddy Kupfer when he watches the commercial and his head turns into snakes and bugs. The last part I love is the ending, it keeps you in suspense. This classic film earns the right to be called ""Halloween III"" Although Michael, Dr. Loomis, and Laurie Strode have been taken out, this is good Halloween material. It starts off with a man trying to run away from some men in business suit. In his hand, he's grasping on to a Silver Shamrock Halloween Pumpkin mask. Later, he passes out and taken to the hospital. Later in the night, he is murdered by one of the business man. Dr. Daniel Challis wants to investigate why he was murdered. Dan has a bad relationship with his ex-wife and hardly spends any time with his kids. Dan and the murdered man's daughter; Ellie Grimbridge make a plan and go to Santa Mira where the Silver Shamrock company is. (For some reason, I love the scene at the bar when Dan is drinking beer and that silly cartoon is on, then the original Halloween plays.) Conal Cochran is the boss, and Dan finds out that Conal is a warlock who plans to use the popular masks as a way to kill all the children on Halloween. Dan must stop it from happening. This really is a classic in its own way. I highly recommend Halloween III: Season of the Witch!!!",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
96,Vomitron_G,"""They're fun, they're frightening and they glow in the dark""",8,8 December 2005,"Before writing this review, I went through the complete IMDb-list of movies released in 1982, only to be able to make the following statement: HALLOWEEN III: SEASON OF THE WITCH is the best horror sequel released in 1982! Apparently, two more titles were in the running to win this dubious award: AMITYVILLE II: THE POSSESSION and Friday THE 13TH PART 3. No other horror sequels were released that year, so I say HALLOWEEN III eats the cake. Everybody knows by now that it's got nothing to do with the Michael Myers saga and it should be viewed as an independent horror-movie with a story of its own. So I will not compare it with other HALLOWEEN-movies.Now, it was at a very young age that I experienced this film and it was the first HALLOWEEN-movie I ever saw. So I had the benefit of not having to expect Michael Myers being in it. Maybe I was a bit too young to fully understand the story, but what stuck with me were, of course, the masks and the gruesome deaths they caused. I also realized it were the TV-commercials that triggered the effect which made the ending of the movie truly menacing to me. And that commercial-tune, that horrible godforsaken 'happy halloween'-tune. Once you hear it, you will not ever forget it.That was many years ago, when I was a kid. Now, many many movies later, I had the pleasure of re-watching this little horror-gem. And it holds together remarkably well. It's dark, strange, eerie, foreboding, gross and truly scary. A lot of that has to do with the excellent electronic musical score by John Carpenter (who also produced) and Alan Howarth providing us several jumpy scares.I will not reveal much about the plot (I don't wanna spoil too much). I think it's balanced and a little bit 'out there' (which is a good thing) and I liked the part where Conal Cochran's brief explanation gives us a hint that there are forces larger than life at play here. This might also be one of the first movies to use the TV-set as an instrument of evil, a theme which became very popular in the 80's. Further more, the movie has the balls to break some of the conventional rules: A ten-year-old kid gets killed and as a protagonist we have a wife-cheating alcoholic doctor (not your everyday hero, I'd say); a more than decent and dead serious performance by an old time favourite of mine: Tom Atkins (please do check out the man's résumé). The make-up and sfx's by Tom Burman are good and gross. The ending might seem abrupt but it is very solid.Do check out the trivia section about this film. It's fun and also explains why John Carpenter tried to do something completely different with HALLOWEEN III. And here's one more: A second clip from the first HALLOWEEN movie, including it's well-known soundtrack, is shown on a TV-set in the room where Daniel Challis is tied to a chair, near the end of the movie.So for all you Michael Myers fans out there: Please let me hear no more complaining about the fact that he's not in this movie. He's already in seven other movies. Instead I wanna hear you say: ""Thank you, mr. Carpenter for producing this highly original frightfest""",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

98,lambiepie-2,Never should have been part of the Halloween Franchise,5,24 October 2006,"This film will never get the notice it needs because it was associated with a successful movie franchise: Halloween. It never should have been included, it would have been judged more on its own merits.First, the Halloween franchise problem: I remember reading several things about the background of this film but the main gist I remember was it was supposed to be a part of the franchise, but no one connected to Halloween wanted to do another, so the studio went ahead and did this, taking the Halloween name on to it and releasing it during Halloween. Bad move. Bad Marketing move. Bad PR move. Bad Advertising move. Bad Branding move. Bad, bad, bad.Second, the movie problem: The movie story was a decent one: Mad, rich corporate toy maker wants revenge on children by making killer masks, then has their media buying department to buy commercial time on all broadcast channels on Halloween night and play the commercial that triggers the killings all at once. But no one cared. With the Halloween brand name, we were wondering where Michael Myers was. Where Laurie Strode was. Where Dr.Loomis was...and with that we were disappointed.This is film of a CEO of horror of the early 80's. Not as chilling or interesting as slasher icon Halloween's Michael Myers in which not for the taste of those looking for a slasher film, but a film of a bitter old man playing out his horrible toy joke towards a mass audience. A doctor stumbles onto the plot and tries to stop it. If nothing else, this movie has one of the most annoying, addictive Halloween songs ever. And they play it over and over and over again.In no way should this have been associated with John Carpenter's Halloween. If you watch, ignore all references to that film and view this just like any other 80's type horror film. Base it on its own merit.

The family that bought the most masks from the deranged Irish toy maker died after they saw their son's head turn into some insects and snakes in test room of the factory. The old sewing lady doll was really creepy I'd like to have it. Then the killings were good and the killers were some murderous man dolls in suits. Dan (Tom Atkins) killed the doll men with chips saved the girl whose father was killed by the masks but she became a doll too and wanted to kill Dan on their way back from the weird Irish town. Dan busted it and wanted to stop the commercials and probably failed. The deranged Irish man wanted to sacrifice the kids for Halloween as they did thousands years ago. It was creepy, fun and cheesy at times but overall I really enjoyed watching it.

100,mentalcritic,Give them an A for effort...,2,23 October 2004,"One of the many fundamental problems with sequels is that after a while, they feel less like continuations of a story than they resemble the screenwriter's regurgitations. Halloween 2 proved to be an excellent example of this, with a whole lot of plot points basically recycled from the original, and very little, if anything, new brought to the table. While this sequel wasn't a total box office disaster, it didn't rake in the unprecedented dollars of the original. Hence, meetings were called in search of ideas to make the new Halloween sequel more palatable than the past.The idea they came up with was simple enough. Tell a new story that could easily be borrowed from the Twilight Zone and see how that works. Had it been a success, future Halloween films might have been something besides Michael Myers Kills Anonymous Boring Girl #447. Unfortunately, Halloween part three commits a few snafus along the way that made it very difficult for a discerning audience to digest. Not surprisingly, it flopped.The first implausibility occurs when Ellie comes looking for Doctor Challis. She wants him to help her track down her father's killers, answer the question of how manufacturers of Halloween masks are involved, and, implausibly, sleep with Challis in the process. The Australian video releases appear to have all been censored in order to comply with the requirements of the OFLC's M rating, so that last point is a little choppily rendered. As are most of the brutal slayings that occur during the ninety-six minute running time.Several other major blows to the film's credibility occur along the way, but none is quite so shocking as Cochran's big dialogue about ancient Halloween rituals. Anyone who is familiar with the paranoid delusions of Jack Chick will find something disturbingly familiar about this monologue. It is at this point that the more intelligent members of the audience generally yawn and turn off their DVD player (or VCR was it was in the mid-1980s). Which is a shame, too, because the rest of the film had so much potential, but this one scene makes it obvious why the film never lived up to said potential. Simply put, it doesn't give its audience a lot of credit for their intelligence.If there is one saving grace to the film, it would have to be the last scene with Ellie. This is the one surprising moment in the film, and it is just enough to mess with the audience in the way a mystery-horror film should. Unfortunately, it comes right after the aforementioned ""what Halloween is really about"" monologue, so it has quite a lot of stupidity to rise above.I gave Halloween III: Season Of The Witch a two out of ten. Had it been thought out a little better, it probably would have earned more. As it is, we can only view the film on home video and wonder what might have been. Not surprisingly, Tommy Lee Wallace's entire career has since consisted of little more than B material.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
101,hnt_dnl,"Creepy and unsettling original ""sequel""",9,1 November 2015,"HALLOWEEN III:SEASON OF THE WITCH (1982) is an anomaly of a movie. It's the ONLY film in the ""Halloween"" series that has absolutely nothing to do with Michael Myers. In fact, at a key point in the film, one of the characters is actually watching John Carpenter's 1978 film ""Halloween"" on TV! So that pretty much confirms that this ""sequel"" is not in the same universe as the one where Michael Myers exists. I'm not really the biggest fan of the ""Halloween"" series overall. In fact I think the original film is somewhat overrated. To me, ""Psycho"" is the true creator of the slasher genre, not ""Halloween"", which basically ushered in the era of brainless nonstop killing of clueless teenagers and the killer who can't be killed. Except for perhaps the original ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series and ""Saw"", I generally think of other infamous slasher series as all being interchangeable. Jason, Michael, Leatherface...what's the difference? Some psychologically damaged individual who had a terrible childhood basically takes it out on everyone in his path.""H3:Season of the Witch"" takes the series in a refreshing direction by being it's own entity. For an early 80s film, the film boasts an incredibly scary atmosphere accompanied by a very creepy score. And I dare say that the acting in this film is better than in any other Halloween movie! H3 is carried excellently by horror movie icon Tom Atkins (who plays Dr. Daniel Challis). Atkins also appeared in 'The Fog' as well as 'Night of the Creeps', but this movie may contain his personal best performance in the horror genre. In addition to Atkins, the other standout performance is delivered by Dan O'Herlihy (as Cochran), one of the criminally underrated performances of a villain in a horror film. O'Herlihy is a perfect villain, charming and dignified on the surface, but underneath a cold, calculating menace which surfaces in the film's climax.The plot of H3 is that an injured man named Harry Grimbridge shows up at Daniel's hospital in a sleepy California town, ranting and raving about ""they will kill us all"". Harry is holding onto a strange- looking Halloween mask. While in recovery, one of the men chasing Harry kills him by gouging out his eyes, then escapes only to blow himself up in his car. Daniel has his assistant examine the remains of the blown up man and enter the Harry's daughter Ellie Grimbridge (played by 80s hottie Stacey Nelkin), who wants to know the details of her father's mysterious death. Harry was owner of the local toy store and Daniel and Ellie soon find out that he was recently in the town of Santa Mira trying to wholesale buy some of the factory's popular Halloween masks. So the duo head to investigate.The fictional burg of Santa Mira is another great character, an isolated, eerie location seemingly in the middle of nowhere with odd residents who keep their eyes on Daniel and Ellie the whole time they are there. The isolated atmosphere gives the movie a creepy vibe that permeates throughout. Even the daytime scenes are creepy!In terms of acting, I've already mentioned the stellar work by Atkins, our stalwart hero, who plays Daniel as a very flawed man, who drinks too much and has an eye for the ladies and is somewhat of a deadbeat Dad with an ex-wife and 2 kids. Daniel's journey really redeems the character. And O'Herlihy is brilliant as the evil Cochran. Stacey Nelkin is not so good as Ellie, who has little dialogue and is sadly used only for her looks and the typical hot 80s girl there to prop up the hero. There are also some funny minor performances from the actors playing the middle-aged couple with a young son that take part in Cochran's experiment and last but not least scene-stealing Marge! Also, kudos should be given to all the extras playing Cochran's goons, who did a tremendous job of giving off a creepy vibe. I've seen many a throwaway horror movie where the acting was atrocious! This is not one of them.It's probably blasphemy to say that I enjoy this more than the original ""Halloween"", but I frankly do. I'm not necessarily claiming H3 to be a better film. I think it's debatable. But H3 certainly has a unique quality that makes it a more interesting film and there is an ambiguity about it that ""Halloween"" lacks. The other sequels are essentially slasher flicks. This one thankfully goes it's own way!",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

It has more in common with The Invasion of the Body Snatchers.  The story, involving a mad toy manufacturer plotting to kill millions of children on Halloween night, is creepy enough but the whole excecution is downright awful.  There's no suspense here whatsover.  There's not a single creative thought, it's all ripped off from better movies.  If the movie had any real gore, it might stand out somewhat, but they couldn't even do that right.

It's no secret that people hate Halloween III because of it's disconnection with the killer Michael Myers. However to the contrary, Halloween III is a rather sick, twisted and satisfying venture of blood-lust. The villains are weak and the robots are hideously lame but for some reason the demented angle on the plot keeps you watching. Another flaw is the movie takes time getting started but things are never that boring and overall the movie is entertaining in a schlocky kind of way. While it's definitely not as good as the first Halloween movie, I do prefer this entry over the disappointing second entry because at least here there is a set up and a follow through which leads to legit suspense and good atmosphere. Also the movie hates children and the way it kills off children (and their parents) provides fascination due to how a movie like this could not get made today.

105,one9eighty,The one without Michael Myers,3,4 February 2019,"This is not a Michael Myers Halloween film - more like a twilight zone film. I knew this before I watched it which meant I wasn't hung up on that as a starter.The evil head of an Irish novelty toy factory has been putting computer chips in Halloween masks. The chips are created with a little of Stonehenge mysticism and he has made technology which, when started, causes the chips to kill the wearer of the Halloween masks. His plan is to sacrifice a large portion of the populous on Halloween to his pagan gods. Only an enthusiastic doctor who gets accidently mixed up in plot stands a chance of stopping the mass sacrifice and end the potential terror.This isn't a good film by a long long way. It stinks of desperation to cash in on the first Halloween film, It's got a weak plot, and despite being from the 80's it feels like it could be a film from the 60's or 70's with how cheap it looks. I like tacky and cheesy films - but this really isn't that strong at all. It's also not scary and really doesn't deserve to be called a horror film; it feels more like a random sci-fi episode of the Twilight Zone, or maybe a poor Stephen King short story which has been committed to celluloid. This feels like it could easy be a cheap version of something like ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" or ""They Live"". The pace of the film is all jumbled up - while it takes the lead character till the 3rd act to work out that there might be something slightly wrong going on, it takes him no time at all to fall into bed with the daughter of a random stranger that died in front of him.Purely because I have seen a heck of lot more worse films this can have a 3 out 10 - but that really is being generous.

107,TOMASBBloodhound,"""A good magician never explains.""",5,24 October 2004,"Let me begin by saying that I hated this film as a kid. After viewing it the other day on a whim however, I was surprised at how much better I liked it now. The story centers around an evil mask-maker planning to use ancient technology to murder millions of children on Halloween night by selling them masks with a nasty little secret inside. I found the story very interesting, though plenty of plot holes ultimately keep this film from being all it could have been. The biggest obstacle in this film's way is the fact that it has nothing at all to do with the other ""Halloween"" films made either before or after it. That's certainly no reason not to give it a chance, though. Perhaps it should have been called only ""Season of the Witch"" or something so as not to anger the purists out there who demand the presence of Michael Myers in anything with the word ""Halloween"" in the title. That said, let's take a look at the good and not-so-good elements of this film, shall we?Like the previous entries in the series, this film has some creepy and effective music. It is also buffered by some evil synthesizer sounds at every turn. The little jingle set to ""London Bridge"" is annoying, and I'm sure it was supposed to be. There are some interesting deaths, to say the least. Early on, we see a robotic henchman pull apart a victim's skull, then blow himself up in a car. One hapless woman gets an energy beam projected through her face, leaving her mouth much larger than normal. (a bug then crawls out of her head, foreshadowing later events) Another man gets his head ripped completely off for threatening to torch the bad guy's factory. Later on, a family is murdered in a test demonstration of what happens when someone wearing one of these masks watches a certain commercial on TV. Bugs and poisonous snakes form inside the mask and attack anyone in the room. It seems the masks have some tiny pieces from one of the blocks from Stonehenge implanted in the factory seal. Something about the commercial triggers the effect within the mask. And just how does this happen, you ask? ""A good magician never explains,"" the mask-maker points out in one scene. Sigh.Some gigantic holes are present as the story unfolds. Tom Atkins, who plays our hero, has a useless love affair with the daughter of an early victim. If these two are so intent on solving a deadly mystery about the death of her father, and bad guys are all around, would they really stop to have sex? He is also much older than this woman. I guess since Atkins plays a doctor, the young woman finds that sexy. Maybe I'd better go to medical school if I want to score with hot young women when I'm his age. Another problem concerns the time that these masks are supposed to go off. We are told by the mask maker that when the commercial airs at 9:00 pm on Halloween night, all the masks will react and kill the children. However, if it's 9:00 in California (where this takes place) it would be 11:00 where I live or midnight on the east coast. Children would mostly be in bed by then! Few parents would allow their kids up that late to watch any ""big give-a-way"". The plan is to wipe out kids all over the country, but it looks like only kids on the west coast would be up when the commercial airs. If there was an explanation about how this problem would be overcome, I missed it. I guess once again, ""A good magician never explains.""And just how in the hell did this guy steal a piece of Stonehenge, anyway? He admits it was difficult, but again offers no explanation of how it was done!And how many freaking times did the female robot attack Atkins at the end? I lost count. Well, it's not a total loss. It was a neat idea for a film, but they shouldn't have glossed over so many things. I'll give it 5 of 10 stars.

108,The_Movie_Cat,"""Stop it, please, for God's sake, stop it!""",3,27 September 2000,"WARNING: REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSHalloween III: Season of the Witch has got to be the most original idea I've ever seen for a movie: that is, a sequel that has no relation to the rest of it's franchise.Imagine Star Wars Episode II centred on chartered accountants from Islington, or a fourth Indiana Jones film that's a cartoon about a zoo trip. Halloween III, in a commendably daring move, makes no reference to Mike Myers or associated characters, and instead takes us on a voyage of killer pumpkins and the most appalling Irish accents on celluloid.Interestingly, Nigel Kneale, he of Quatermass, managed to salvage his reputation by removing his name from the credits after co-writing it with Tommy Lee Wallace. Wallace also directs, a style that has arguably less directorial skill than my own back passage.Of course, you sense this is played mainly for laughs, complete with the so-irritating-it's-catchy Halloween advert. Actually, no, it's just irritating. (Come to think of it, I realised the jingle bears a frightening similarity to ""London Bridge Is Falling Down"". Isn't that against the law or something?) Keeping up with all the Halloween films, it features clips of other movies on television sets. Whereas the first quite bizarrely featured The Thing from Another World four years before John Carpenter was due to remake it; this one nicely features a trailer for the original Halloween. However, this joke is milked too far when the original film playing on a TV becomes part of the actual plot.There's a bit of Driller Killer influence in there, and a finale that involves a deadly robot double. The robots actually feature throughout, expressionless automatons that are reminiscent of Village of the Damned. If Village of the Damned featured estate agents instead of small children, that is. In fact, you could argue that this element influenced The Matrix. Not a very good argument, though.Is it scary? Well, I did become quite frightened at several ghostly apparitions and terrifying double images filling the screen - but then I realised that's because I was watching it on Channel 5, Britain's newest channel with the notoriously poor reception. Perhaps the scariest thing is that Tom Atkins plays Daniel Challis in a charisma vacuum, yet still gets lusted after by a nurse and gets to shag the girl with the juicy jugs (Stacey Nelkin). Despite the fact that her father's just been murdered in horrific circumstances, she still cannot help but get her kit off and won't even be dissuaded by Daniel's asking ""aren't you even in the least bit tired?"" Together they unravel a ""plot"" to take over America, just for a ""joke"", which involves a subliminal advert being played on TV, inducing moths and snakes to magically appear in pumpkin masks. Stonehenge has also been transported to this mysterious factory - The Silver Shamrock - for reasons that are never fully explained.Halloween III is a pretty lame film by any standards, though not offensively so given that it was trying (however badly) to do something new, and that it doesn't take itself seriously. However, it doesn't reach the heights of so-bad-its-good, as, like the majority of the Halloween films, it is generally quite tedious.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
109,fernandoschiavi,"Season of the Witch appears only as a commercial excuse to take advantage of Michael Myers' success through a story about the occult, a mad scientist and brutal crimes",5,29 August 2021,"In 1978, John Carpenter's Halloween introduced a new killer villain named Michael Myers and his chosen victim, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis). Three years later, Halloween II continued the story right after the events of the first movie and revealed that Michael and Laurie were brothers. Soon after, the producers and creative minds behind the now franchise decided to take a bold step and do the third act without the characters already established in previous films. And that revolted the fans. The third film in the franchise, Halloween III: Halloween, left Michael and Laurie (and the slasher genre as well) behind and instead focused on a new story with new characters and a more fiction-oriented tone. Scientific.Halloween was originally planned by John Carpenter and Debra Hill as an anthological series of horror movies set on the night of Halloween, meaning that each movie would have its own characters and setting. Michael Myers' story ended with Halloween 2, so he didn't have to appear on Halloween 3, but audiences had already tied the movie's title to the character, which is why it wasn't well received. Halloween 3 had a witchcraft theme, where Dr. Dan Challis (Tom Atkins) and Ellie Grimbridge (Stacey Nelkin)'s investigation into a mysterious murder led them to Conal Cochran, the owner of the Silver Shamrock Novelties company, who was trying to resurrect the old aspects of Samhain and planned to kill children through their Halloween masks and a TV ad.Silver Shamrock is a prank toy and artifacts company that started creating masks for Halloween on a massive scale, spreading across the United States quickly. Ellie and Challis realize that there is something very strange about this company and decide to investigate, going to the small town where the factory is located. Here begins one of the film's assets: the atmosphere. ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" embarks on a small-town atmosphere and mystery that manages to carry even the stillest scenes of the film. You think nothing much is happening when in fact the whole background is being deepened.After being captured by agents who worked for Cochran, the man behind the shadowy company, Challis, discovers the real plans of the man who looks like a James Bond villain. The masks have a device attached to their material that will be activated at nine o'clock on Halloween night, thus sacrificing all the children who were taken to buy the masks. It is easy to see here the film's criticism of mass products and capitalism. ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" didn't want to be another mass product. I no longer wanted a sequel that would make thousands of dollars with an easy-to-repeat formula. And that's the sin of the movie in the eyes of many. Trying to be original and unique, the film is seen as a failure.The problem, in this case, is not the production itself, which by the way was in charge of the duo John Carpenter and Debra Hill, but all the expectations generated by the eighties frisson by slashers and by the iconic villain Michael Myers. Let's agree that after a sequence of two movies with the same character, the most natural would be to have a third one with some connection to him... but with the failure of the same box office, Halloween becomes the only movie franchise where there is a leap between II and IV without any connection between the frames. It's hard to imagine the reasons for the so negative reception of Season of the Witch. The mere fact that we don't have Michael Myers is enough to infuriate fans, but the fact that horror fanatics walk into the theater expecting a terrifying slasher and have received a recycled and trashy version of an episode of Beyond Imagination certainly is. The definitive factor.Written by director Tommy Lee Wallace (in his role debut after acting as a production designer on the two previous films), the plot is much closer to science fiction than horror, and it tests the viewer's patience by introducing us to flashy concepts, characters. Laughable and not pleasant dialogue - this coming from a franchise with naughty doctors, mind you. Wallace even brings an interesting satire on consumerism and the use of the media to manipulate children, but it's a very shallow argument and one that gets lost in the tackiness. It's at least curious that the doctor played by Atkins simply gets involved so quickly in this web of mysteries, despite the fact that he starts a love affair with the daughter of the runaway patient from the beginning of the film, in the strangest and most unchemical relationship ever seen in the genre in a long time. There's no good actor who can take something out of such a poorly written premise, and Atkins and the beautiful Stacey Nelkin seem not to try so hard (although the girl brings an interesting performance during the third act). Only veteran Dan O'Herlihy seems to take advantage of the situation, in the shoes of the unscrupulous Conal Cochran, manifestation of evil and truly sinister corporatism as the CEO of Shamrock - but it is one of those cases where the actor offers something far superior to what he was in paper.As a director, Wallace is not particularly inspired. Although he has a good eye for framing and composition (most of them when involving some form of peculiar architecture, see his previous profession), he is unable to build a palpable atmosphere or provoke tension. The notion of the 10 days before Halloween proves to be flawed by a series of ellipses that give us the impression that the entire plot unfolds over a weekend, and at no time are we able to feel fear or discomfort, as Wallace it relies on long shots punctuated by a lazy synth soundtrack. When Wallace does the best ground preparation, where we would finally see the secret behind the Halloween masks, the delivery is so generic and aesthetically disappointing that it completely invalidates the strength of the revelation and the team's efforts to try to offer something really disgusting; in other words, was that it?Halloween III has an interesting story, with elements of pure horror, dark magic, brutal murders, the traditional mad scientist type villain, and even science fiction in the introduction of advanced androids as important supporting actors in the plot. The death scenes are well-planned and memorable with the right to crushed eyes, severed head, disfigured face, insects and snakes protruding from the skull, head pierced with a drill, and a dose of violence that is not behind many cult films produced in the same time. The huge computers and electrical panels in the mask factory's central laboratory bring back memories of old science fiction movies from the 1950s and 60s, with their devices filled with lights flashing in all directions.The ending of Halloween III is different from the traditional and, even though it is a little predictable, the story ends satisfactorily in the desperate act of Dr. Challis in trying to warn the authorities about the disaster that was to come. However, a very notable flaw, and which curiously had also happened in the previous film, directed by Rick Rosenthal in 1981, was the lack of movement in the hospital, even at night, allowing an assassin to walk peacefully through its corridors, killing a patient and leave without major difficulties.""Halloween 3 - Season of the Witch"" is not a perfect horror movie, but it doesn't deserve all the scorn of the fans. It is a work misunderstood in its essence and discarded for not being what was expected, never being analyzed for what it set out to be. His legacy is as hopeless as the film's ending, with the hero failing in his mission. One thing is more than certain: if the movie wasn't part of the franchise, or if the franchise had from the beginning set out to be an anthology connected only by the commemorative date, ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" would be a horror classic along with the greats of the decade.Throughout the 99-minute film, Halloween III: Season of the Witch appears only as a commercial excuse to take advantage of Michael Myers' success through a story about the occult, a mad scientist and brutal crimes involving the media as support. If it were produced out of the series, it would be another average horror film from the 1980s, but the ordinary proposal makes it enter the pantheon of hacks in the history of the genre, in short, a film without charm, dignity and reason to exist. It's really sad to see a good proposal failing that way. As good as Carpenter and Hill's intentions were in injecting new life into this precious franchise, Halloween III: Halloween doesn't have a script or mythology interesting enough to keep the viewer's interest.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
110,FilmOtaku,Hmmm a sequel to Halloween that has nothing to do with Michael Myers? Let's greenlight it!,1,19 September 2003,"Why was this movie made?  The ridiculous plot concerning a Halloween mask company named `Silver Shamrock' who distributes masks replete with microchips that will make the owner's head blow up while watching a television program wasn't even remotely interesting.  Nor was the casting of a heinous leading man whom we are to believe was a studly doctor.  So the viewer may ask themselves: `What does all of this have to do with Michael Myers?'  The answer?  Absolutely NOTHING.  Which leads me to wonder why this film was even made under the Halloween franchise?  Even the bald and shiny pate of Donald Pleasance was missing  a fixture that would have been annoying but at least gave a correlation to the other films. 
The only good thing about this movie was the catchy television jingle for Silver Shamrock.  I first saw this film when I was a 9 year old, sneaking in to see this one instead of E.T. and walking out sobbing with fright, (Remember, I was 9) but for the last 21 years I've remembered that jingle so I guess it had some modicum of an impact on me.

Sure, it had nothing to do with Michael Myers, but it doesn't matter. It had a creative premise: People who wear masks while watching a Silver Shamrock TV theme song get killed by Stonehenge rocks behind each mask's head and spew insects and snakes everywhere. The TV advertisement's owner Conal Cochran plans to put the computer chips on each mask as an attempt to use black magic on Halloween and Dr. Atkins must find a way to stop his plan once and for all.With a premise that good, I think this is a completely underrated horror shocker that spooked the wits out of me in my first few views. The story does have a few plots holes and the part where Cochran dies was utterly confusing, but those flaws are outweighed by it's redeeming factors. The acting isn't that bad, it's well-paced, the direction from Tommy Lee Wallace is pretty efficient, the death scenes are very creative, the visuals are the epitome of excellence and the music from Alan Horvath and John Carpenter is spooky and atmospheric which fits the darker tone of the film perfectly. Even the ending was chilling and the Silver Shamrock theme song is so catchy it got stuck inside my head forever.Overall, Halloween III: Season of the Witch isn't exactly a masterpiece, but in my opinion, it's completely underrated and should be watched before or when Halloween starts.

Halloween was a superb horror-thriller; it's follow up was decent, but that story was pretty much played out by then. The Myers follow ups after this just rinse and repeat. Get over it: this one tried to do something different. It partially succeeds and partially fails. At least it was original.Nigel Kneale, legendary author of the Quatermass serials, provided the basic story for this movie, and possibly an early screen-play - one which was altered enough to have him take his name off the credits. But the idea of a Halloween mask factory hiding a sinister secret has his stamp all over it.I didn't find any other review on here that mentions Santa Mira is actually the fictional town from Don Siegel's Invasion of The Body Snatchers, which nicely plays into the themes of this movie.Tom Atkins is a watchable and realistic leading man. Remember the days when not everyone had to look like Tom Cruise and be flawless to be a hero? And you have to like Dan O'Herlihy's smooth- talking villain.Where the movie fails is in explaining exactly WHY he wants to carry out his plan of sacrificing thousands of children on Halloween night, or what he stands to gain by it. His motivations are murky, and what exactly is that power that the blue stone from Stonehenge generates? This is one case where a little more exposition might help.The factory itself, though is nicely sinister, with its dark secret and robot guards and ""misfires"", which plays like an echo of Quatermass II.Shame this movie wasn't all that successful.

They all want sure things. That's why we get so many remakes and sequels to movies these days. Their actions aren't without reason. Moviegoers are a fickle bunch. Something that sounds or looks good on paper may not translate well when it finally hits the big screen. Universal Studios and John Carpenter learned that lesson the hard way with ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch.""With the release of ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" on Blu-ray, horror enthusiasts are given the chance to once again revisit the one and only entry in the franchise that doesn't feature knife-wielding Michael Myers. It would seem like common sense that a movie whose first two entries banked on the masked Myers' teenage killing sprees wouldn't work without him.However, producers John Carpenter and Debra Hill wanted to move in a different direction and launch an anthology series under the ""Halloween"" banner. Fans protested by simply not seeing the movie. It's still the weakest performer at the box office out of the 10 films in the franchise. However, a cult following has built up around the film over the 30 years since its release, encouraging Shout! Factory to unleash it in high-definition.Shop owner Harry Grimbridge (Al Berry) is taken to a hospital clutching a Silver Shamrocks brand Halloween mask and cryptically murmuring, ""They're going to kill us. They're going to kill us all."" Dr. Dan Challis (Tom Atkins) becomes more and more suspicious after the man is murdered in his hospital bed by a figure in a three-piece suit who later lights himself on fire.After Grimbridge's daughter, Ellie (Stacey Nelkin), informs Challis that her father's last stop before his death was at the Silver Shamrock factory in the small Irish town of Santa Maria. The two decide to investigate the sleepy town and see if the factory and its owner (Dan O'Herlihy) and workers have anything to do with the mysterious death of Grimbridge.""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" is a bit of a mess. I give producers John Carpenter and Debra Hill and director / writer Tommy Lee Wallace kudos for trying something different, but the result is a mish- mash of science fiction and horror genre elements that don't blend well together. Honestly, Dean Cundey's cinematography is the saving grace of the movie. He gives the film way more style and class than the convoluted plot deserves.It's interesting to see actors like Tom Atkins and Dan O'Herlihy give such strong performances in this low-budget misfire. They both portray their different characters with such strong conviction. The two add another level of professionalism to the movie. Actor Stacey Nelkin plays the young Ellie, who is obviously cast in the film to attract teen guys by her good looks and girls because of her strong spirit and independent drive.As a stand-alone film, ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" isn't completely devoid of entertaining and effectively gruesome moments. There's some fun to be had while watching it.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
117,oOgiandujaOo_and_Eddy_Merckx,Genuinely creepy,10,18 January 2017,"The title of this film leads you to believe that it's a Michael Myers slasher movie, but it isn't. It's an authorised use of the franchise label, Carpenter himself was involved in the production, but it's a really different type of horror movie from the first two. Carpenter actually originally planned for all the movies to have different characters and scenarios, but the first was so popular it got a sequel.I knew it wasn't a Michael Myers film but I wasn't familiar with the plot. That's actually quite a good way to watch this one.Scenario-wise the film is about as preposterous as it's possible to get, say as preposterous as toxic waste from a chemical plant producing Nazi zombies with laser guns. And if you care about such things, do not watch the movie. It's not just the premise either, there are particular plot developments that seem unfeasible.That aside I found the film genuinely to have a horror atmosphere right the way through, and it contained moments of truly abject horror and byzantine creepiness. It has been pointed out to me that Nigel Kneale (uncredited), the writer behind Quatermass was involved with the project, and a lot clicked into place when I heard that, because you can feel some of the atmosphere of Quatermass 2 in the scenario here, and with the dialogue about Samhain, that just had to be written by the same guy who was writing the Hobb's Lane dialogue for Quatermass and the Pit (i.e. connecting the present with a quickly established supernatural past).Halloween III is genuinely a horror film with messages, about corporatisation of culture, surveillance, the insidiousness of mass media, in a way that really sunk in for me, it wasn't just window dressing. You could even view it as positively avant-garde, it's almost Baudelaire-ian in its rejection of modern culture. People have scratched around for the villain's motivation, but for me it doesn't lie much further afield than this quote from Baudelaire, ""Personally, I think that the unique and supreme delight lies in the certainty of doing 'evil'- and men and women know from birth that all pleasure lies in evil."" It presents wickedness as its own reward. Dan O'Herlihy is particularly great here, who you may remember as ""The Old Man"" of OCP in RoboCop. He portrays an utter creep in this movie! The movie, however lumpy and problematic it is plot-wise, maintains its high standards in terms of visuals and soundtrack the whole way through (John Carpenter does the soundtrack). It actually gets good enough visually that I would say it has some pretty iconic images.Recommended to people who liked films like Michael Mann's The Keep or Richard's Stanley's Hardware. That is people who like atmosphere-thick narratively-fractured horror movies.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

This movie was made in 1982, i first watched in 22 years later (2004) as i never heard or seen this movie before, I thought that this movie was OK, the music to the silver shamrock, HAPPY HAPPY HALLOWEEN, HALLOWEEN, HALLOWEEN, HAPPY HAPPY HALLOWEEN, SILVER SHAMROCK, AND THEN WITH IT ADVERTISED DAYS BEFORE HALLOWEEN FALLS (31ST October) 8 MORE DAYS TO HALLOWEEN, 7 MORE DAYS TO HALLOWEEN, 2 MORE DAYS TO HALLOWEEN, AND THEN ON THE NIGHT THE HAPPY HAPPY HALLOWEEN COMES ON WHEN LOTS AND LOTS OF CHILDREN ARE BUYING THE SILVER SHAMROCK HALLOWEEN MASKS. To me, i think Halloween 3: Season of the witch has got to be the least best movie in the halloween series because Halloween is mainly based on about the serial killer Michael Myers, i think it was a bit of a show off with Season of the witch coming out because i thought it spoilt it and then halloween 4 was released and it was back to the plot with Michael Myers on the loose again and killing more of his victims. i give Halloween 3: Season of the witch 5 out of 10.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
120,TalesfromTheCryptfan,An underrated thriller!,9,22 October 2008,"In Southern California, Dr. Daniel Cahills (Tom Atkins) was puzzled by an old toy salesman babbling a mad tale of someone going to kill us all. After he dies, Cahills discovers the strange Halloween mask that the old man held could be a clue or link to his death with the help of a woman named Ellie (Stacey Nelkin) as they both go to a town called Santa Mari. And over there, it's the home of the popular Silver Shamrock novelty and toy company which the owner Conal Cochren is a modern day warlock and his plan is to sell magic Halloween masks that will kill every child across the nation on Halloween night.An unusual but quite good installment of the franchise that tried to do something different. Fans and some people are like ""What? this isn't a Halloween movie? where's Michael?"" well people just don't the facts behind this movie and it's idea. You see folks, Michael Myers died at the end of ""Halloween 2"" as John Carpenter and Debra Hill intended to cause they had enough of Michael Myers and when they were writing ""Halloween 2"" they wanted to end his story including Dr. Loomis's. Hill and Carpenter had a concept to make the franchise into a big screen horror anthology (ala, ""Creepshow"", ""Tales from the Crypt"" or ""Twilight Zone"") of telling different Halloween themed horror stories every year. Unfortunately the idea went wrong when they didn't tell audiences or marketed the concept right, thus when this movie came out in 1982 audiences were confused and fans demanded Michael back. I thought this was a well done and imaginative Sci-fi horror thriller in that has a very H.P. Lovecraft-esquire and David Cronenberg-like feel to it with a good score, one memorable death scene and of course the creepy twist in the end.Sure fans of Michael won't like it but just give this another chance cause it was suppose to be an experiment for the franchise.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

The hero is such an ordinary person caught up in this strange spooky situation. Good soundtrack with a super bizarre classic scary TV commercial. Disagree with people who say writing and acting is bad. The truth is our society literally poisons kids on Halloween - and this film takes that to the next level.

123,LoneWolfAndCub,An unfairly maligned entry in the franchise,8,22 October 2018,"Halloween was meant to be a stand-alone film, Carpenter never intended it as a franchise. After the success of Halloween Carpenter was asked to write Halloween II which he did not want to do, in fact in an interview he said he wrote one night with a six pack of beer. It shows as well, Halloween II pales next Halloween but is good enough as a slasher. Halloween III was meant to begin Carpenter's anthology idea, have a new story based around Halloween each entry.This was entry focuses on Dr. Challis (Tom Atkins) who becomes entangled in a plot which revolves around a cult aiming to kill a lot of people on Halloween through cursed children's masks. It sounds outrageous and it is, but it is original and a hell of a lot of fun. The plot moves swiftly and is often engaging, Atkins is excellent as our hero and he plays well alongside Stacey Nelkin (who plays Ellie Grimbridge) and a deliciously evil Dan O'Herlihy (the villain Conal Cochran).There is a lot to like here aside form the acting: the score is excellent (and no one will soon forget the infamous Silver Shamrock jingle) and the gore effects are fantastic. In fact this film is incredibly gore and is often not mentioned when talking about cool death scenes. One man gets his skull crushed by someone's bare hands, another their head ripped off by bare hands and one poor lady has face melted off with a laser. And the movie has the balls to kill a child in a fairly graphic way. The downbeat ending also plays in the films favour.I think this film deserves way more attention than it gets. It is by far one of the strongest entries in the franchise and as a stand-alone works well. If this were not Halloween III but just Season of the Witch it probably would get far better reception.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
124,raypdaley182,The one without Micheal in,4,10 November 2007,"Written as an attempt to break away from the Halloween/Micheal Myers franchise. This is the one with the annoying masks, the equally annoying song/TV advert and the evil mask makers who want to kill millions of children on Halloween.Clearly they had a bad experience from Trick Or Treaters? The film starts a bit like the end of the original version of ""Invasion Of The Body Snatchers"" with the man and his mask and his claims that ""their coming to kill us all"" and the creepy men in smart suits.After the man who warned them is killed the local Doctor and the man's daughter decide to trace her fathers footsteps which lead them to a town that has a curfew (come on? no-one challenged a curfew? In America? Never going to happen!).Of course they discover the town is being controlled by 1 man who is bent on destruction using unexplained (or unexplainable) technology. The mystery men in suits turn out to be automatons covered in wax which explain their superhuman strength. The deadly Silver Shamrock advert is tested on a salesman and his family who are all killed.Of course their both captured and he escapes (having seen clips from Halloween the move on 2 separate occasions) and of course he's stupid enough to go rescue the girl after he tries to warn his wife to protect his own kids.Using a trick he'd already learned about earlier (which killed the woman in the motel complex) he destroys all the wax automatons and seemingly kills the guy in charge. (it's a bit hazy about exactly what happens with the big stone in the warehouse).After escaping it appears the woman he saved isn't the girl, she's been replaced by a wax automaton so he kills her but is almost killed by her arm. The film ends pretty much the same way it started but he manages to ring the TV stations and warn all but 1 of them. Very weak ending to a very weak film that's thin on plot.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
125,statuskuo,An Actual Hallowe'en Film,7,22 March 2021,"Those of you who follow the John Carpenter template of ""Halloween"" flicks will be disappointed. I get it. You expected a slasher. It isn't. This is actually a REAL Halloween movie. And, in terms of going by the title the ONLY one that can really call itself ""Halloween."" Because it is all about the Halloween lore.The whole point of Conal Cochran's (Dan O'Herlihy) entire motivation is simply this: trick or treat. In this case...he wants to pull the single biggest prank on the world. How hard is that to understand?He makes toys and has an evil megalomaniac approach to the world. That's it. It's also about the roots of the holiday. Which is based in some pagan witchcraft/magic.It is a slow burn but had it not been associated with Carpenter's flicks, perhaps it would've been given a fair chance.
Now I recall when I first saw it as a teen, I was deeply disappointed because Michael Meyers wasn't in it. As an adult now, I see the value of it. Also the actual horrific possibilities and creepiness of the film. Also...Tom Atkins is just such a likable dude.Kudos to director Tommy Lee Wallace for taking the brunt of all the criticism.
Those who lambasted this film here, all I can say is, stick with the paint-by-numbers remakes and reboots and dull, dumb ones they make, because you are the audience that deserves the godawful 2018 abortion. Or the subsequent sequels. Until you get tired of the same garbage.I repeat...HALLOWEEN is NOT Michael Meyers. It is about trickery and mayhem. Sure those of you who quit on this flick drooled over ""Joker""
Now why isn't it a 10 for me?
There are some unnecessary brutality in the flick I didn't think this film required. They did that for the audience who wanted a more gorier flick. That was a little bit of a sell-out.
Time has proven this film to have a little more love to it than first realized.
In terms of TRUE ""Halloween"" films, this, in my opinion, surpasses the original.
Heresy! You may scream.
No, this took a very normal circumstance and made it fascinating. The original ""Halloween"" was treading on tiresome babysitter murder films. Or more accurately films like ""Black Christmas"" This one dared, and succeeded in its own way, to be its own man.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
126,Aylmer,Unfairly Maligned Oddly excellent early 80's downer horror movie,8,6 May 2008,"Of course this film is not perfect. It has a number of lapses in logic and poor performances endemic to any early 80's low-budget horror film. However, it's really something special - a horror film that is actually unsettling and effective. Usually horror movies tend to be quite dull and unoriginal, bogged down by the done-to-death motif of a crazed serial killer on the prowl.I like movies like this - where the killer is not limited to a single entity and instead is more of an all-round aura of evil. In this case the villains are a crazed toy businessman and his deranged toy company, which employs a number of zombie-like android henchmen in yuppie-ish business suits! It was the early 80's and this film is certainly a product of its time, complete with the usual downbeat atmosphere and shocking gory ""quality kills"".The cast is overall pretty average, relying heavily on Dan O'Herlihy as the solid villain to anchor things down. Tom Atkins makes an acceptable everyman-type hero (though, like THE FOG, is oddly popular with the ladies even though he's out of shape, ugly, and not particularly charming). Watch for Dick Warlock (Michael Myers) as a murderous henchman. A number of the supporting characters as recognizable TV actors as well.The real standouts here are Dean Cundey's wonderful gloomy photography and John Carpenter's downbeat and droning synthesizer music. The two elements come together so well that they'd elevate the dread-factor of any horror movie they appear.Overall, the film is hands-down a huge improvement over HALLOWEEN II, and better than all the sequels which followed. Unfortunately the experiment of making a Halloween-themed horror movie without Michael Myers and marketing it as a sequel did not pay off financially. Stupid public. Don't be a sheep - give this movie a try. You may be pleasantly surprised.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
127,Java_Joe,Better than most people say but not as good as they think.,6,1 November 2017,"The main problem with this movie is that there's no Michael Myers. When John Carpenter and Debra Hill decided to take the Halloween movies into a more anthology direction people were angry. They wanted Michael Myers so they scrapped the anthology and gave us more Michael. This wasn't necessarily a good thing. The original Halloween is an undisputed classic of the horror genre. Lots has been written about it but there's only so much you can tell about an indestructible killer in a William Shatner mask. This is why after Halloween II they decided to go a different route.Enter Halloween III: Season of the Witch. The only Halloween movie not to feature Michael Myers as the killer. The one considered by purists to be the worst of the entire series. And the one that in recent years has had a resurgence of popularity because if you look at it as a stand alone horror movie, it's better than what people say. But even with that, it's pretty silly.The plot deals with masks that will kill the children wearing them on Halloween when a specific signal is broadcast over TV. That's pretty much it. It's never really explained why other than this will somehow bring about the resurrection of the ancient world of witchcraft. Each mask contains a large microchip with a fragment from Stonehenge and this is somehow going to cause insects and snakes to pour from the person wearing the mask. It's kinda silly but what do you expect? But if you look at it from outside of the Halloween series it's s decent movie. Better than how it was originally received but not as good as a lot of people are making it out to be.6/10 is the most generous I can be with this.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

129,ebeckstr-1,Ignore the low reviews,8,18 October 2020,"At least among IMDb reviewers, Season of the Witch is ridiculously underrated. This movie was never intended to be a part of the Michael Myers series, so rating it low because it doesn't fit into that series doesn't make any sense.Season of the Witch is creepy, unusual, and atmospheric. It has a wicked sense of humor, too, which includes satirization of the commercialization of Halloween (the holiday) and American consumerism in general; which, probably with intent, is ironic in light of how commercialized the Halloween movie franchise had already become at the time of this film's release. I get the impression that most of the movie's detractors just don't perceive the humor and satire that accompanies the traditional horror aspects and tone of the movie.Season of the Witch is also filled with wonderful character actors and has some downright surreal moments. A sense of doom pervades the story (which seems like something Ramsay Campbell could have written) because of very good direction and pacing, and a script that works well as a 1980s horror flick.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

It seems that the company has hit on a fantastic gimmick... or is there something more sinister behind the mask?This is a film that would've worked well if it were Halloween II. After the original, the series was set up to go in any direction, and an anthology would've suited it well. However, the studio's decision to make the second one a direct follow-up with Michael Myers returning placed a metaphorical curse on this film. Because having the sequel offer up more of the same only cemented that expectation in the minds of the viewers. Although it's unfortunate that this film gets the reputation and response that it does, it's understandable why Halloween fans were largely unimpressed with this entry.On its own, it's a fantastic film. It's like Goosebumps for adults, and that's said in the best way possible. It's bizarre, it's uncomfortable, there's something just a little off about it, even if you can't necessarily pinpoint what exactly that is at any given moment in the film. It's an enjoyable enough sequel with a different enough story from the first two to make it interesting. Doesn't make it better than either of them, by any means, but it's an interesting and entertaining story.If you're looking for the Michael Myers/Laurie Strode films, this is a definite skip for you.

It's about a sinister toymaker who manufactures halloween masks with an evil secret. I think this is a great story. The movie is a bit slow but keeps on going and becomes more and more interesting as the plot unravels.Bonus shout for great synth music that enhances the atmosphere. I wish it was used even more. Only the ""happy happy halloween"" song will be stuck in your head after watching the movie.

I don't want to give away any elements but I will say this film departs from the first two. This story is very different. There is a desperate feel to the characters and their search to find out what is going on. A man died clutching a Halloween mask and states that ""they want to kill everyone"".

However, the stupid close-minded people beg to differ. When this hit the screens, they didn't care at all. All that was on their minds was ""Where's Michael Myers?"". And because this has a different story and no Michael Myers, people automatically rated this so low. In my opinion, this movie was great. I suggest you watch this movie first then judge it AFTER. Don't be one of those stupid close-minded ""Michael Myers"" lovers. Watch this with an open mind, and the thought that this is DIFFERENT than the other Halloweens.

140,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,5,22 March 2005,"Firstly, yes this has little or nothing to do with the other Halloween films, and it is the worst so far. To gave it credit though it must be said that Carpenter wanted to take the series in this direction, telling a different story in a different film each Halloween. This was an ambitious and exciting idea which had potential, even if that potential was limited. Unfortunately this film is a mess, and flopped, ending Carpenter's idea. Viewers were expecting more Myers mayhem and were disappointed by the complete change of direction here.An evil toy maker decides to kill millions of children via his Halloween masks. He is the owner of the company Silver Shamrock, and infuses all the masks with black magic which will burn any child who wears it on Halloween night when a special jingle is played. After a successful advertisement campaign it seems that his mask is a massive hit, and his plan will be complete. Only Doctor Challis and Ellie can stop the evil, but will they make it? This was the first Halloween movie I saw, when I was very young, and a few moments have stayed with me since then- Cochran's goons on patrol, killing anyone who gets in their way, and the jingle which is admittedly creepy, though a familiar tune. The idea is good, but it falls on its face through a combination of bad acting and poor storytelling, and in the end little makes sense. The shock ending is still good though, but its potential impact is decreased by the fact that we don't care for the characters, that we don't really meet any kids, and that we have become bored by the end.Plus the makers seem to have forgotten about the time difference in a country the size of North America. Little is explained, most of the deaths are bizarre, while sufficiently bloody. Plus the whole thing looks cheap and doesn't have enough scares. If there had been a better cast, more thought with the storyline, and better direction it could have been a lot better.

141,mwilson1976,"Eight more days til Halloween, Halloween, Halloween...Eight more days til Halloween...Silver Shamrock!",6,20 March 2020,"With a pinch of Hammer Horror and a dollop of 80s gore, this meta horror about a doctor (played by Tom Atkins) investigating the murder of a patient, who uncovers a conspiracy about a novelty goods company making Halloween masks in small town California, is probably the boldest in the Halloween franchise yet. Original director John Carpenter (who produces here alongside Debra Hill, as well as contributing one of his most memorable movie scores), always envisaged Halloween as an anthology series, the only connection between the movies being the seasonal theme. Directed by Tommy Lee Wallace, it is the only Halloween movie not to feature Michael Myers (although he does appear in a trailer for the original movie playing on a TV in a bar). Instead it sees evil old Dan O'Herlihy (from Robocop), attempting to use the mystic powers of Stonehenge to kill children on Halloween night, as they all sit around the TV in his masks watching the Silver Shamrock commercial. Don Post created the cool latex masks worn in the film, which include a glow in the dark skull, a lime green witch, and an orange day-glo Jack O'Lantern. Nigel Kneale (of Quatermass fame) wrote the original screenplay, but asked for his name to be removed from the credits after producer Dino De Laurentis insisted on adding more violence and gore. It was the worse performing Halloween movie at the Box Office, audiences hating the fact that Michael Myers was abscent, so he subsequently returned for several sequels, a remake, and a reboot. It's a real shame, even though it may not be a canonical Halloween movie, this is still much better than you remember.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
142,bob_meg,Cheap? Schlocky? Kinda. Horrific? Definitely!,7,5 November 2010,"Having seen Halloween I about 20 times in the theater and on cable growing up, I was an absolute psychotic fan of the film. I didn't care for the sequel, but that probably made me run double-time to the local theater (skipping school, no less) to see the premiere matinée showing of ""Season of the Witch."" I was 18 at the time. And...I hated it. I had no idea it didn't feature Michael Myers and that was the problem I guess---a pall of disappointment that prevented me from enjoying the deviously nasty B-movie I was stuck sitting through instead.Another reviewer commented the film has a ""midnight movie"" or ""creature feature"" quality to it---and that's dead on. The acting is sub-par for sure (with the exception of Dan O'Herlihy, who plays the part of the main heavy with just the right amount of droll evil). The effects outside of the mask sequences are cheesy. But the whole affair is played out with such grim seriousness that---when I finished watching it for the second time, 26 years later, I was amazed at it's genuine ghoulishness.The villain's plan couldn't be sicker and more fiendish: to mass murder thousands of children at once on Halloween. But it also offers an acidic commentary on holiday commercialism, mass consumer conformism, and divorced-parent apathy. Add a nicely Body Snatcheresque sub-plot and the mass effect of the film moves beyond queasiness. Which could be a good reason why it's so reviled. The ""test screening"" sequence is almost surreal in its sheer nastiness.I have to wonder if poor Tom Atkins was in on the joke. Some of his deliveries are so deadpan (""I need a drink!"") that you can almost sense him winking at us, even as he's seducing the young co-ed daughter of the first murder victim less than 24 hours after watching her father die in front of him.I usually hate Tommy Wallace's stuff, but his heavy hand almost works to the advantage here. With a nice amount of references to Halloween I to get you smiling, and an all-too-brief but acerbic-as-usual cameo from Nancy Kyes Loomis Wallace (Annie from Halloween I), as Atkins put-upon ex-wife (wearing a bizarre gray fright wig, no less).",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

H3's got heavy atmosphere, a wonderful soundtrack, creative kills, and DREAD in the air",8,17 April 2008,"People are incredibly stubborn about this movie. So it has absolutely nothing to do with Michael Meyers or anything in the first two movies...so WHAT??? It is an extremely solid horror film and one of the best in the entire series. It is a well-paced horror classic that apparently only appeals to the more sophisticated horror fan as it lacks dry humor and the slam-bam explosions and killings everyday horror fans are used to, and trades them in for heavy atmosphere, sci-fi twists, and serious performances that are heavy on the dread. The John Carpenter soundtrack kicks ass, letting it keep the atmosphere that graced the first two. Tom Atkins is a solid retro lead whose mustache could challenge Tom Selleck's. Stacey Nelkin is adorable as the panicked female companion. And some of the deaths are horrifying! I consider this a classic and a truly creepy movie! The commercial is so effective and creepy that by the time it comes on during the second half of the movie, you may find yourself feeling slightly claustrophobic!Reminds me of one of my favorite sci-fi/horror movies ever - SCANNERS. I have no idea why this movie has a 3.6 on here! People are just too stuck on their precious Michael Meyers character.

144,theshadow908,A sad entry into a good series.,1,18 May 2006,"Halloween III: Season of the Witch is an in name only sequel to the first two movies. Halloween III makes the drastic mistake of getting rid of Michael Myers, moving away from Haddonfield, Illinois, and focusing on different (and far more bland) characters. This movie tells the story of an evil mask maker who has inserted ancient Celtic runes into his masks with the intention of killing every child wearing one of his masks. If you think that sounds stupid, you're right. That's basically all there is to the plot, and the movie is incredibly boring. Nothing of great interest happens, except it gets pretty gory once in a while.The acting in this film sucks. Whereas the first two films had some accomplished actors like Donald Pleasance and Charles Cyphers, and the future superstar Jamie Lee Curtis, this movie has a whole bunch of nobodies acting worse than soap opera stars do. If they had tried, it might have raised the quality of the film...But that didn't happen. Tommy Lee Wallace does a crappy job taking over in the director's chair. This movie is so poorly made, I wonder if he was even there half the time. John Carpenter decided to stay on as producer/composer. His producer credit must not have given him much input, because his style isn't present in this movie at all. He even changed his chilling score from the first two Halloweens into an annoying unmemorable tune. I guess he decided to leave the series after this film for a reason.Really, any fan of the Halloween series should totally ignore this entry. There's no point to watching it whatsoever. I caught it during a Halloween marathon, and I sat there wondering ""So where's Michael?"". To be fare though, you can view it as its own film. I think that if this movie had just been called Season of the Witch, it might have prompted two stars out of me instead of one.1/10",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

Fair enough, they did that with House, and the first two weren't completely awful.But I've got a better idea, seeings as the first movie we made about a babysitter stalking mass murderer, let's make the second movie in the series a sequel and the start them on the different stories from number III onwards? Sounds like a bad idea, and as it turns out it was. Not only is Halloween 3 a below par movie, it did mediocre box office and was the last Halloween movie made for six years.The story here is that a witch is making evil masks, or some nonsense like that. Evil ensues, deaths occur, people sit there wondering what on earth is going on and exactly what this had to do with Micheal Myers. The answer is nothing.Bizarre movie, if evil Halloween masks, over the top scores and poor acting float your boat, check it out.

147,buckikris,Halloween 3 Delivers; But I'll Never Look At Rubber Masks The Same Since Then,8,1 November 2014,"I first saw this movie back in 1982. I went to see it at the Salem Mall, Dayton, Ohio. I was 10 at the time and I will never forget this theater experience. This movie scared me so much, it made Friday the 13th look tame. To me both movies scared me; but something about H3 made my skin crawl. The movie starts off in Northern CA., a man Harry Grimbridge is running for his life with a Halloween mask in his hand. A car is approaching fast, and he is just looking for help. Grimbridge finally finds a gas station, the attendant rushes him to the hospital. Once there the guy, Essex Smith, asks the Dr. If he could go. Harry Grimbridge is finally in the hands of Dr. Challis ( Tom Adkins). Grimbridge hears the commercial advertising for Silver Shamrock Halloween masks. Grimbridge tells Challis they are going to kill all of us, referring to the commercial. Dr. Challis just chalks it up as a crazy old man talking gibberish. Once Grimbridge is in a room, a man dressed like a business man comes into the hospital. He finds Grimbridge and proceeds to pull his skull apart by the nose. Challis is alerted to this by hearing the nurse Agnes scream, he tries to stop the man; but can't. He watches in horror as the man sets himself and the car on fire. The next day Challis meets Ellie( Stacy Elkin), Grimbridge's daughter. The mystery begins to start especially when the Sheriff tells Ellie some crazy man probably on drug's killed him. She nor Dr. Challis believe that's the case. Ellie and Dr. Challis team up and tells him she is not going back until she finds out what happened to her father. Ellie keeps a journal of her father's whereabouts. She explains to Challis she believe he ran into trouble in Santa Mira, because he didn't show up for a dinner date with a friend. She and Challis take a trip to Santa Mira, home of the Silver Shamrock mask company. It's a predominately Irish community and it's a very suspicious town. There they meet the CEO so to speak Conal Cochran, who is not to be trusted. Ellie and Challis find a motel nearby and pose as a married couple. There they can have privacy and talk without alerting anyone close to Cochran. Meanwhile once they are shown their room Challis investigates further. He finds out Ellie's dad was at the same motel, Cochran is not who he claims to be, plus the community is under strict curfew, surveillance cameras watch your every move; and Cochran doesn't hire locals. Challis also checks in with Teddy an Assistant at the Medical Examiner's office. She tells Challis it is strange there is no bone fragments found in the accident. She explains something should have shown that there was a human in the car. Challis and Ellie now know something happened to her dad at the factory. As soon as Ellie and Challis settle in to the motel more people arrive. A sales lady who is From San Francisco, Marge Gutman; and A top salesman, Buddy Hempfer, with the family in tow. Marge meets her fate because she needs to return an order, instead she is a victim of a misfire. Ellie and Challis are like W. T. F. When they hear about Guttman and wonder what a misfire is. As the movie proceeds we learn that Cochran's top employee's are Assassin droids; and will kill anyone who gets in Cochran's way and expose what he really is. Ellie get's kidnapped, Challis tries to find her, then he discovers what some of the employees are. Cochran gives Challis a video demonstration what he has planned for the children with the masks. The other sacrificial lamb are the Hempfer family. After seeing the video Challis discovers what Cochran has planned and tries to stop it. In the end he rescues Ellie, gets even with Cochran, and escapes. Meanwhile Teddy from the M. E.'s office finally puts the puzzle together; but eventually meets her demise with one of Cochran's assassin droids. While driving to the closest town he realizes Ellie is really quite, he asked if she's O. K.,, then all of a sudden Ellie's arm tries to strangle Challis. Ellie has been killed and replaced by an android replica. Challis has to fight it off, kill it; and run to nearest place, which is the gas station we see at the beginning of the film. He calls the T. V. stations to get the commercial off the air, 2/3 are off and we are left in limbo on the 3. In conclusion, I loved this film it scared me then and it still gives me the creeps today. This film has nothing to do the Michael Myers, but it can stand on it's own. This is a movie you will enjoy regardless of what the critics said back in 82. So check it out, if you like classic horror flicks from the 70's and 80's this film will creep you out.THX, Kris L. CocKayne.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
148,squeezebox,Highly underrated chiller,7,28 January 2003,"So it has nothing whatsoever to do with the previous two movies. That's somewhat refreshing when one looks back on the countless carbon copy sequels that multiply like rabbits in Hollywood. HALLOWEEN III is actually a pretty cool little movie, with a campy atmosphere (as opposed to HALLOWEEN II's grim nihilism), goofy plot and a fast pace. A crazy dude carrying a Halloween mask is being chased by some corporate-looking assassins. He escapes, stumbles into a gas station ranting and raving that ""they're going to get us"" and is taken to the hospital, where he's killed by one of the assassins, who then blows himself to bits in the parking lot. This disturbs Dr. Challis (Tom Atkins) and the crazy dude's daughter (Stacy Nelkin), who take it upon themselves to investigate his death. Turns out he was a shopkeeper who found out that the Halloween masks he stocked in his store were programmed to kill millions of kids when a TV special airs Halloween night. This plot was devised by evil toymaker Connell Cochran (Dan O'Herlihy), who's p***ed that the Pagan roots of Samhain (correctly pronounced for once as ""SOW-WHEN"", much to the chagrin of death-metal fans everywhere) have been lost in commercialism, and wants to teach us all a lesson. Lots of enthusiastically gross special effects (faces erupt with swarms of bugs and snakes, heads are crushed and ripped off, people puke up green slime) and some great B-movie dialog make this one a must for genre addicts. Forget those who shrug this one off and give it a fair shot. You'll be surprised at how genuinely entertaining it is.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

Then I did...It was really really good! Great story that's very well thought out with a quick story that unfolds very well. The opening credits where very cool.

I usually watch it every Halloween, as I find it to be very atmospheric and it's camp nature lends it a feel that further differentiates itself from the other films in the franchise. In fact, only for the title bearing the name and number this could not be considered part of the franchise at all. The more negative press this film receives I think only makes it more of a gem for those of us who enjoy it.A man is attacked in a small town one night and arrives at the local hospital clutching a Halloween mask. Doctor Dan Challis finds it odd, but things get even stranger when a man in a dark suit comes in and murders the man during the night. Challis meets the man's daughter, who believes that her father's death has something to do with the Silver Shamrock novelty company, owned by Irish man Conal Cochran (a superb performance by Dan O'Herlihy). The pair travel to the sleep town of Santa Mira to find some answers.The idea here apparently was that John Carpenter and Debra Hill were finished with Michael Myers and wanted to make standalone Halloween films every year. But of course, the masses of people are simple, and could not appreciate this. That is not to say that ""Season of the Witch"" is anywhere as good as the previous Carpenter films with the titular killer, far from it - this really is a B-movie - but it has a style about it. The performances are decent, Tom Atkins is commanding in the lead role and Stacy Nelkin makes a good supporting role.

161,revival05,"Misunderstood and overlooked, but still a very bad movie",2,27 October 2009,"I sat down and went into Halloween III the other night, come the end of October and all, with a weird sense of anticipation. It's one of those movies I hated as a kid because Michael Myers wasn't in it and blah blah... Peer-pressure, one of the most dangerous and evil forces entangled with childhood! I can't say I expected it to be any better than any other 80's schlock movie, and for about twenty minutes or so, I felt that I was watching something... well, really quite watchable! But after it all was done, to my great surprise I realized that, while it may be for other reasons, this is still a horrible movie!At a surface level, Halloween III has a lot of things going for it. It's dark, has a nice thick atmosphere and some surprisingly effective gore that seems to not gross out for the sake of it and therefore it rather becomes strange and fascinating, which is the key, I think, to good gore effects. The music score is nice, albeit not as wonderful as many defenders would like to have it (it does the job but is very primitive and a little half-assed). Also, Dan O'Herlihy is always a delightfully cooky villain.That's really as far as any positive remarks goes with this movie. And I suppose I can understand that a lot of people like this movie because of no other reason than that it looks good and has some gore. Actually, I might have accepted this movie for that too had it not been for one totally crucial problem of this movie: It totally lacks any kind of motivation. The plot has no roots, no platform, it's just a series of events with no or very thin consistency. The problem isn't at all that the movie isn't about Michael Myers. I know a lot of people will take this as total blasphemy, but I really don't need Halloween 4, 5 or 6 if I instead could have a couple of diverse and original horror movies, having nothing in common but a very suitable Halloween theme. But nothing that happens in Halloween III has anything in common with anything.Tom Atkins, in a very confused and uncertain performance, plays a doctor who gets puzzled when one night they roll in a guy on an emergency stretcher shouting that ""They're going to kill us all"", only to be executed later on by a guy in a zombie state of mind who inexplicably walks into his car, pours gasoline all over himself and lights himself on fire. He hooks up with the dead guy's daughter (Stacey Nelkin, who also makes a poor performance - and you can tell when her first scene is the identification of the grossly murdered father and her reaction is laughably unconvincing). Atkins should pick up his kids who are with his ex-wife but, oh no, he goes on a detective hunt with this girl while the movie totally shifts into a, very poor, thriller with romantic undertones. They aren't at all confused about what they are doing, they are suddenly very determined to find out the mystery behind it all, and they even have the time to get personal! They arrive at the most implausible of implausible Twilight Zone-communities and when one ridiculous piece of plot device leads to the other, we eventually end up in the lair of a Bond villain - though it doesn't look more high tech than Wall Mart - who has a plot involving mass murder of children - for no particular reason! And there's a piece of Stonehedge there too! This could all be forgivable if there was something there to forgive it for. But I don't care about the people in the movie, I barely know anything about them and they don't make any sense. Nothing that happens seems likely or suitable. I recognize the scenarios presented in themselves - from better movies - but why am I watching them? It's like they just make it up as they go along. The main, and I mean the most obvious and fundamental, reason the original Halloween worked was not because of Michael Myers, it was because I understood who the characters were and what the situation was. The plot worked at the most basic of levels - it was tangible. A plot involving mass murder of children should come off as either 1. Over the top and just plain mean-spirited or 2. Great shock value, but it comes off as neither since it's not tied into anything sensible. I'm not buying it at all, I'm only thinking that the people involved couldn't come up with anything. Every attempt at a suspenseful setup is predictable, the dumbest might involve a grown man jumping up and down tied into a chair with a stupid skeleton mask on his head. I get the feeling whoever wrote this screenplay had a gun to his head and like twenty minutes to go from start to finish. No, what am I talking about. The finale must be the dumbest. When they have come this far with the parades of anti-climaxes and bland bits and pieces of would-be suspense, including the most diplomatic death pose of a villain in cinematic history and a fembot with manners that would make Austin Powers laugh, do they REALLY expect us to care for these stand-in child actors, that annoying commercial jingle and a telephone call which suggests hitherto unknown powers from some random doctor to the entire global television industry of America? And do they expect us, in the midst of this well stirred up inferno of plot holes, to keep a straight face upon the final lines? STOP IT! STOP IT! STOP IT!!!

It's really better than most a lot of 80s horror flicks and the more I frequent cons and message boards, the more I see appreciation growing for it.The other thing that I definitely think is an acquired taste is that this is one wacky movie. There are huge leaps of faith required for enjoyment and one has to accept some very ""out there"" plot points, but c'mon. It's 80s horror. Name me one of them that doesn't require some of the same. Just have some fun with it.The movie definitely borders on the line of sci-fi and has a tone that reminds me greatly of INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS or, even, THEY LIVE. The mindless automaton assassins employed by Silver Shamrock to protect their master plan are reminiscent of the body stealing pods from either movie. Right from the opening tone- setting scene when one of them pursues a man into a hospital, dealing out a horrible death to him before setting itself on fire, the viewer knows they are up against an evil that is almost as unstoppable as Michael Myers himself. Yes, I said it. They aren't as effective, sure, but it's that same sense of man hopeless against an unrelenting force. When our main heroes arrive in the factory town, it's very much a BODY SNATCHERS moment. Nothing is normal in this town and that makes it all the more unsettling because there is no safe place to hide as the all-seeing camera eye watches everything.Of course, the real star of the show is those awesome Don Post masks. Before we know of any nefarious plot, there is something a little bit off about those masks. Then, we see what they are capable of doing - - melting faces and inducing eruptions of insects and reptiles. Those scenes did scare the hell out of me as a kid and are still effective now, even if a little silly.All of this is part of an ancient Celtic plot to sacrifice children. As stories have long shied away from the killing of children, this one just dives into it headlong and says ""screw it. We are just gonna show one kid dying. We're gonna unleash a plan to massacre tons of them"". It's definitely a subject matter often avoided in this much volume.I'm not saying this approaches the quality of Carpenter's original masterpiece. It's also much better than the 4.5 rating here on this site and I'm willing to bet that many who hate it would praise much worse 80s b-movie flicks. It's always going to be reviled by those who wanted Michael, but maybe it's time to get over it. Anyone would have to admit it's better than the convoluted ""man in black"" trilogy that would follow in the series.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

165,happyendingrocks,"If you ignore the ""Halloween III"" in the title and accept the film for what it is, this really isn't all that bad",7,28 October 2012,"I want to make it clear right up front that I certainly understand why fans of the Halloween franchise roundly dismiss this third entry, and if you're inclined to cry ""foul"" because Season Of The Witch essentially ignores the events of the first two films and introduces a storyline that has nothing to do with Michael Myers, you should probably consider sitting this one out. In hindsight, I agree it wasn't a good idea to impose this outing as part of the series, but it's worth noting that John Carpenter and Debra Hill endorsed the deviation by producing Season, and while their experiment is deeply flawed because of its inconsistencies and inherently confusing because of its Shape-lessness, when you consider how horrendous the Halloween saga would become a couple of sequels later, there might have ultimately been some prescient wisdom behind their attempt to take their creation in a new direction.Halloween III definitely has enough macabre moments to qualify it as part of the horror genre, but the nucleus of the film is decidedly anchored in the realm of science fiction. The story itself is a unique and novel yarn about a malevolent toy company that manufactures wide-selling Halloween masks which are outfitted with murderous technology intended to initiate a mass slaughter on Halloween night. A toy store proprietor stumbles across this sinister scheme, but before the panic-stricken man can share his knowledge, a stone-faced assassin in a suit and tie enters his hospital room and silences him forever, then pours gasoline on himself and self-immolates. The effective set-up establishes an intriguing mystery that makes even the dicier elements of the film engaging to uncover, and the deeper we plunge into the intricacies of the master-plan, the darker and more unsettling the movie becomes.Granted, this material is probably better suited for an episode of The Outer Limits than a feature-length follow-up to a two-flick slasher suite about a ghost-faced serial killer, and the thematic distance between Halloween III and its predecessors becomes more and more pronounced as the film rolls on. But, while the episodic nature of Season is admittedly apparent because the film has trouble maintaining its momentum through its entire run-time, the majority of this oft-maligned excursion is pretty enthralling nonetheless.Ironically, despite the absence of the Shape's butcher knife handiwork, III is one of the gorier episodes in the series. Better yet, the FX work is relatively solid, so when heads get torn from their torsos and craniums burst open to release wriggling hordes of insects and worms, the film conjures up some enjoyably gruesome tableaux. The fantastic nature of the plot allows for some creative conjurations in this department, and though many in the audience will be disappointed that this outing never ventures anywhere near Haddonfield, those looking for good old-fashioned splattery fun will find plenty of gooey diversions here.Sturdy and reliable Tom Atkins serves as an excellent everyman protagonist to confront the film's mounting menace, and veteran character actor Dan O'Herlihy sells a convincing portrayal of our deceptively dangerous villain Conal Cochran, so even when the tale veers into oblique obtusity, the quality of the presentation remains high. The isolated community of Santa Mira, where the mask factory is located, is also well-essayed, and the claustrophobic dread generated by the all-seeing surveillance cameras and the omnipresence of Cochran's inhuman henchmen keep the proceedings rooted in a dystopian dynamic that will undoubtedly remind attentive viewers of the enslaved world later portrayed by Carpenter in his brilliant They Live.There are a few befuddling devices introduced throughout the film that distract from the story at large, the most bizarre being the television screenings of Carpenter's original Halloween that appear along the way. Though this was probably intended as a sly wink to fans, the resulting fictionalization and minimizing of Michael Myers is an incongruous and somewhat insulting twist that falls resoundingly flat since it seems to diminish the inaugural outing of the series while doing nothing to augment this one. The messy climax is particularly troublesome, veering headfirst into hysterical oddity instead of resolving the story and answering very few of the lingering questions it creates. If we take the concluding events literally, the grand scheme of Conal Cochran is to make kids' heads explode, which triggers the release of poisonous serpents from the resulting cranial cavity to kill off their parents. Exactly how this is possible is never explained, and while the ensuing ensemble of bugs and slimy critters is gross enough to produce strong visceral visuals, the familiar and somewhat banal nature of these manifestations doesn't have nearly as much impact as the genesis of some foul monstrosity we've never seen before would. Surely, an evil overlord with the power to replace children's brains with slithering creepy crawlies by merely showing them a television commercial could summon up something more fearsome and exotic than rattlesnakes? Since it lacks a worthy pay-off, Season Of The Witch ultimately winds up being a promising concept that doesn't really come to fruition. But until the film falls apart, it packs in enough immersive and interesting elements to be a thoroughly enjoyable ride. Halloween III isn't anywhere near perfect, but whether you count it as part of the series or not, it still handily surpasses several of the Michael Myers-led installments which followed it. Give it a fair chance and it just might surprise you.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
166,Toronto85,Halloween III: Season of the Witch,5,28 June 2013,"Michael Myers is nowhere to be found while a madman plans to murder trick-or-treaters in 'Halloween III: Season of the Witch'. We first see an older man running from men in black suits who are clearly trying to kill him. He babbles on about how ""they are going to kill us all"" while clutching a Halloween mask made by Silver Shamrock Novelties Company. That man is murdered at the hospital. This prompts our main character Dr. Daniel Challis, along with the man's daughter Ellie, to go on a road trip to the town in which the Silver Shamrock factory is located. They want to find out what the man was talking about and what the masks have to do with it all. What Daniel and Ellie discover is more shocking than they ever could've imagined...I want to give Halloween III a better rating, but it cannot be overlooked that they COMPLETELY take the Myers plot from the first two and throw it out the window. I never saw this in theatres, but I can imagine it was a letdown to movie-goers expecting to see some hack-and- slash from good ole' Mikey. Nevertheless, this third film is not all that bad. The plot is new/refreshing and is played out well on-screen. The acting is good enough, with legend Tom Atkins leading the way. It just moves a little too slow at some parts for my liking. 'Halloween III' isn't a horror film as much as it is sci-fi. There are some kills as these robot like men in suits murder anyone that gets in the way of the evil plan to kill kids, pretty gruesome kills at that.'Halloween III: Season of the Witch' is not a bad film, but without Michael Myers is a weak sequel to an enjoyable 'Halloween II'. It should have dropped the Halloween name and been a stand alone film, it might have gotten more positive reviews that way. The closest we get to Michael Myers is when Daniel is forced to watch the 1978 film on television at the mask factory...5/10",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

When Halloween III opened that night in theaters, lets just say the ratings were not as good as the first two. The film takes on a completely different plot having no connections at all to Halloween and follows a famous company who are known for making Halloween masks and when a young girls father dies, she begins to suspect the mask incorporation have something to do with it and soon they discover what actually happens when you watch the commercial with your mask on. Halloween III is an amazing film, the acting is incredible, the writing is fantastic but I think Hill and Carpenter should have known waaaaaay better not to do this to a big franchise waiting for a masked killer slasher film.

168,talisencrw,"A fine directorial debut for Tommy Lee Wallace, which deserved a much better fate than it initially received!",8,9 May 2016,"I distinctly remember being in Grade 8 when the film came out, and for four major reasons: 1) The excellent TV commercial, with John Carpenter's spooky music and the spider crawling out of the mouth of the mask; 2) The decent book adaptation written for young adults, that I read at the time, and thoroughly enjoyed; 3) Karen Carpenter died of a heart attack from anorexia nervosa; and 4) Major songs on the radio around that time were 'Centerfold' by The J. Geils Band and 'Bette Davis Eyes' by Kim Carnes. Though I had not yet seen the previous two films and wasn't old enough (the R-rating, and my parents were somewhat strict about that kind of thing), I really wanted to see it, but over the years, I never really got around to it, until recently I found used the entire 'Halloween' franchise on a 10-blu ray pack, and no longer have any sort of excuse, really.I loved Wallace's work in 'Stephen King's It' (except for the last half-hour, but that's probably the book's fault and not the director's) and I thought his 'Vampires: Los Muertos' was rather underrated, so an added attraction for me was to watch his directorial debut here. He impressed me. I enjoyed the film and all of the extras on its blu ray very much. If you like horror films at all, you should watch this.Protagonists Tom Atkins and Stacey Nelkin are very good here, and I liked Dan O'Herlihy even better than when I had previously seen him in 'The Virgin Queen', 'Imitation of Life', 'The Cabinet of Caligari', 'Good Against Evil' and the first two 'RoboCop' films, and, as always, Dean Cundey provides excellent cinematographical work and the soundtrack by Carpenter and Alan Hogarth is dependably solid. Don't bother with the negative reviews that came out at the time the film was released: Most people were upset that the film didn't have Michael Myers in it, and didn't give it a chance.

It starts out that a man runs from these men in suits and finds a gas attendant and goes around talking about these men that are going to kill everybody.  The men come after the man and his daughter goes out to find whoever went after her father.  Along with her and this doctor that has little experience in acting and this is very observant in his caracter because he fails to uplift his caracter and is instead very dull and unmoving in this film.  The lady that ends up to be his fling does not do a very good job with her role as well.  She ends up looking at the doctor as nothing but a sexual object and they end up just tagging along with eachother during the investigation.  Anyway, they end up at a laboratory of robotic workers that make masks and put a chip in the back of the masks and when the commercial of the masks comes on, thousands of children are supposed to die.  This is stupid and we only see one example of this happening and that is during an experimental demonstration.  then the part of stonehenge missing and the lab ends up taking it somehow mysteriously and cutting off chips of it and making it for the masks.  Then the ending is the most silliest thing I have seen in this movie with the doctor sitting on the phone calling television stations demanding that they cancel the commercials of the masks before it's to late.

171,dormesher-21565,Very underrated,8,6 October 2018,"Halloween 3 Season of the Witch the underrated horror movie in my opinion and one of my favourites in the franchise this movie so unique and dark and must watch for horror especially fans of the 80s.
This was the movie that tried to get away from Michael Myers and do something different they wanted to turn Halloween into a anthology series like American Horror Story or The Twilight Zone.I think this movie is fantastic and such a cool and unique story with a great main villian who wants only to sacrafise children on the holiday of Samhain for an old druid ritual using power from a peice Stonehenge he and his minions stole. Such a great story and twisted story with great characters.Now I will say this movie isn't perfect I think the masks looks really silly just you're typical Halloween masks but they make them sound like there the best thing ever invented in the films but they look really silly. Also I wish we would of seen when the main lady in the movie got turned into an android it was a great twist but it's never really clear weather she was one all along or got changed when they split up I wish they would of made this made this more clear would of added a bit more to the twist in my opinion.The kills in this one are brutal from one of the androids ripping someones head of to the movie actually killing a kid on screen this movie and brutal and dark and I love it and it's what makes this unique entry in the franchise even more unique and interesting. 
Favourite moment from the film is when the lady in the hotel dies after one of the masks malfunctions and her face gets split open such a cool scene and the practical effects are amazing.Also the Silver Shamrock song will be stuck in you're head for days and it's really catchy.I know this movie gets a lot of hate but I wish it would of done well so we could of got more anthology stories because I'm curious to see what they would of been likeVerdict 8.2/10 great entry in the franchise and very underrated horror movie",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

173,CMRKeyboadist,Another Underrated Movie Due to its Name,9,7 September 2006,"I never have been a fan of the ""Halloween"" series. Not to say that I don't like slasher films, but Michael Myers just never did anything for me. I would rather watch a ""Friday the 13th"" film any day over this series. ""Halloween 3: Season of the Witch"" is the only movie from the series that I just didn't enjoy, but is actually one of my all time favorite horror films. Partially, because Michael Myers isn't in this film. Now, I am sure that people are going to hate my opinion on this, but I really don't care. I believe the only reason why this movie is so underrated and has such a low score on IMDb is because it doesn't have Michael Myers in it. If this movie had dropped the ""Halloween"" title and stuck with ""Season of the Witch"" or ""The Last Halloween"" I think this movie would have much more respect.This movie has many things on its side. The storyline is one of the darkest I have ever seen about a company named ""Silver Shamrock"" selling Halloween masks. All through the movie television adds build up to a big ""Give Away"" on TV on Halloween night. Tom Atkins plays a doctor named Dan who suspects the ""Silver Shamrock"" company after a man is murdered in his hospital. The mans daughter and Dan take a trip to the town where the factory resides and find out much more then they could have bargained for.As I said, this movie has many things going for it. A few great actors including Tom Atkins and Dan O'Herlihy do wonderful jobs. Especially O'herlihy, playing the part of the villain and one of the most evil characters ever created.The music was great also. Performed by John Carpenter, of course. The music brings a great deal of atmosphere to the movie making you feel a sense of dread through and throughout. But, this is a great part of any of the ""Halloween"" movies. Like them or not, most of them have a good soundtrack.And of course, the ending to the movie is one of the best/worst endings ever, in my opinion. Hollywood wouldn't dare have a movie end as bleak as this movie did today.Well, you don't have to listen to me.

175,erwan_ticheler,"Good idea, badly executed",8,12 August 2006,"This third installment in the Halloween saga is a strange one since it has nothing to do with Michael Myers (or Laurie Strode for that matter).The film is centered around a strange plot concerning brainwashing millions of American kids on Halloween night by Irish blooded freaks.The idea is pretty intriguing and it is okay to create a new niche in the Halloween story but the execution is very poor.Carpenter (who strangely enough produces the film) traits are obvious, but the Myers tale has vanished. Still there are some shots that resemble ""Halloween"" like shots over the shoulder of a unknown man and shock effects made heavier by synthesizer tunes.But even then,it sucks. The acting is terrible,Tom Atkins is a complete miscast as the hero Dan and his love interest is even worse.The romantic story between the two is never explained although the hero seems to be married and has kids yet he sleeps with the girl without questions,very strange. By the way,Dan's wife is played by Nancy Kyes who also starred in parts I and II of Halloween.The tail in the climax is pretty funny although it very much resembles endings like ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"". ""Halloween III"" is a bad excuse for a movie and the only reason I saw it was because I want to see every Halloween flick (I've seen 6 of them now) and every time I see a new one, the original gets better.Thank goodness that in part 4 Myers returns although the movie isn't much better. Still, the Halloween story should be centered around Myers and not some kind of conspiracy concerning mass child murder.Oh yes, be advised that there are some pretty gory scenes that are not for the faint hearted although it doesn't make the movie any better. 3/10",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

Well I guess people only wanted to see Micheal Myers. I do give them credit for trying something different, and would have liked to have seen what other ideas they would have had to continue the franchise, especially that the films got worse as they progressed.As soon as the movie starts you can already hear Carpenter's style of music playing, I always enjoyed the music in his movies. Then we get this doctor who seams to womanize every female around him. The plot was an interesting idea, so it kept your attention. Then we move on to a pointless shower scene, and finally a sex scene. I mean really, the film couldn't get by without that, especially that the characters don't even know each other well, it was rushed and pointless. Maybe there is something I don't understand about this kind of stuff..... or maybe it's an excuse to show sex just for the sake of showing it. The finale scenes could have been explained better, maybe the writers didn't even know what to do, I'm talking about the electric circle thing, what the masks do exactly, and a few other things but now I'm just rambling for the sake of it. The ending was either good or bad, that's for you to decide.This review isn't the greatest, but I felt I should write something.

178,bayardhiler,One of the Most Creepy and Unsettling Movies Ever,9,2 October 2012,"Every now and then, there comes a movie where people are so close minded, its unbelievable. ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" is one of those films. Now that Michael Myers was dead, the producers had an idea to make the Halloween franchise into an Anthology series, where each year a new movie would come out that would feature a story centered around Halloween. Unfortunately, the audience was not thrilled with the idea because it didn't have Michael Myers. Such a shame, because this is one great movie. It begins with a man running from guys in dark suits. It makes it to a gas station, clucthing a Halloween mask, yelling, ""They're going to kill us, they're going to kill us"", over and over again. He's taken to the hospital, where a doctor (played by the talented Tom Atkins) treats him and thinks nothing of it. That is, until a man in a suit walks in and kills the man and simply walks out and lights himself on fire in his car. Later, our hero meets up with the man's daughter and together, they believe that something strange is going on with the masks. It just so happens that the mask company is doing a big give away on Halloween night, so whatever is going on, they better hurry. In the town where the masks are made, they find that cameras are everywhere and it feels sort of like mini-totalitarian state. This film has a lot going for it. The music is just very foreboding, the idea very imaginative, in the sense that it manages to include Orwellian themes in the sense that someone is watching you and has very sinister plans in store for you and everyone else. I should also mention the great Dan O'herlihy, who gives an excellent performance as a wolf in sheep's clothing. I'll admit, they probably should have just made this as its own movie and let the Halloween series end. It would have saved us from some of the terrible sequels that followed. But still, the fact that people would criticize this movie just because it doesn't have Michael Myers in it is pretty sad. All I can is don't listen to the naysayers. This is one movie you won't forget.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
179,LanceBrave,I Want to Like You. But I Can't.,5,5 November 2013,"Even as early as 1982, it was recognized that any horror franchise worth its salt had to have at least five sequels. John Carpenter thought ""Halloween II"" was stretching it and couldn't see extending the Myers storyline further. As far as his creator was concerned, the Shape was dead. Carpenter had the novel idea of turning ""Halloween"" into a yearly anthology series, each new installment telling a different story, the only connecting fiber being the Halloween season. The American republic rejected this and demanded more Michael Myers. Carpenter was right about continuing that story being nothing but crass and absurd. Whether ""Season of the Witch"" stands on its own merit remains a topic of debate.Maybe the viewership would have been more accommodating if a less wacky premise had been chosen. Divorced surgeon Dan Challis becomes involved in a mystery when a man is murdered in his hospital, only for the murderer to immolate himself outside. The presence of a Halloween mask leads Challis on an investigation. He meets up with the dead man's daughter and tracks the mask back to its factory. He uncovers a malicious plot to murder thousands of children. How? Through a combination of Halloween masks, television, microchips, robots, and Celtic magic.My biggest issue with ""Season of the Witch"" involves that villainous scheme. The bad guy takes a lot of factors for granted. Yes, the Silver Shamrock masks are popular but surely lots of children will be wearing other costumes. Sure, plenty of kids will be in front of the TV at the time of the commercial. But it's likely many will still be trick r' treating. And how many will have the TV on and also wear their mask? How many children must die for Cochran's plan to be successful? What exactly is his motivation? He wants to reclaim Halloween as a pagan festival. How will murdering thousands of children do that? Why would a corporate head rail against the commercialization of his holiday? What does his robot army have to do with anything? The 'whys' remains elusive.The film features many absurd elements, to the point that Vincent Canby thought it was a parody. How does the combination of masks and commercials kill the kids? By filling their heads with bugs and snakes. How that works boils down to ""magic."" The transformation is powered by a tag on the mask. In the most absurd moment, a woman has her face blown off by a laser beam shot from one of those tags. The magic ritual is powered by a chunk of Stone Henge, which I imagine was difficult to transport. The robot drones are something we have to take at face value, as little explanation is provided. The villain pulls a Dr. No by explaining his plot to the hero before leaving him in an easily escaped trap. The ending is overheated and melodramatic, with Tom Atkins screaming into a telephone before a sharp cut to black.The innately likable Atkins is well-cast as his protagonist is definitely an anti-hero. His ex-wife is cartoonish, unwilling to forgive him for working a lot and trying to save the world. The kids are non-entities, glimpsed once and never developed. Atkins seems more concerned with his new girlfriend. Stacey Nelkin plays that new girlfriend, the murdered man's daughter. After knowing each other less then twenty-four hours, the two fall into bed. The romantic subplot is contrived, not making much sense for a woman still grieving for her father and a guy still grieving for his marriage. All of the supporting cast is broad. The mask seller and his family are terrible people, the wife and son especially, while the woman who gets her face melted is vulgar and unlikable. The cast does fine, with Dan O'Herlihy's leathery-voiced take on Conal Cochran being the most memorable, but the characters are all seriously underwritten.If ""Season of the Witch"" was reaching for scares or gross-outs, it failed. The numerous jump scares are protracted and broad casted. Though Michael Myers is a no-show, part 3 continues the second film's tendency to pad out the body count with random people. Was it necessary to introduce a town drunk? Did he have to die? The gore is decent, with an early face-crunching being satisfying. However, the android soldiers bleeding banana pudding is odd. The digital effects are cheesy and the villain's demise is lazy. John Carpenter and Alan Howarth's score is a major step down. The electronic droning of the main title is directionless and non-melodic. Much of the score is like that. They probably should have kept the classic theme. That jingle was designed to be as annoying as possible and, boy-howdy, did it ever succeeded. You will get tired of listening to that thing.What do I like about the film? Tommy Lee Wallace's direction has a few nice moments, like a frantic tracking shot through a hospital hallway. If you overlook the absurdity, the climatic robot attack generates some tension. Atkins taking out leagues of people at the end is out-of-place but satisfying in its own way. Wallace manages to make Santa Mira, the same town from ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers,"" an eerie place. The constant surveillance and grinning town folks are correctly unnerving. The film's vehemently anti-child tone is doubtlessly mean-spirited but it definitely makes the film unique.Rejected upon release and widely reviled for many years, ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" has, over time, developed its own following. Fans like to point out the anti-corporate themes or the main character's symbolic alcoholism as defining points. Sure. But is it scary? Nope. Does it have that autumn atmosphere? Not really. Is its plot goofy? I certainly think so. I'm sorry, ""Season of the Witch,"" I want to like you. Really, I do. But I just can't.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
180,daggersineyes,"It wasn't awful, but it wasn't great either",5,21 September 2013,"I don't care about the whole ""michael Myers"" thing. I loved the first in this series but everything after that was forgettable. Also I'd heard that the first Halloween was originally planned as a sequel to Black Christmas (which I saw before seeing Halloween) so I'm not particularly attached to the Myers character. Consequently, I was quite happy to see a different story line and I totally understand that the Halloween franchise was always intended to be different stories. That's all OK by me.The problem is there's lots to find fault with in this movie. To take on the Myers-obsessed viewers and get them on board with a Micheal-less sequel, Halloween III really needed to be a stand-out effort. It needed an exciting plot, great acting with preferably at least one big star, fantastic screenplay, inspired/near faultless directing and a gripping score.Halloween 3 only scores on a couple of those requirements. The musical score was decent and the plot had potential. It was a refreshingly original idea, especially at that time and took some bold steps in horror (eg the demise of a child). It could have been developed into a masterpiece in the right hands as either a seriously scary horror flick or a black comedy. Unfortunately it was not in the right hands so it wasn't anywhere near as good as it needed to be to overcome it's glaring obstacle to success.I did not like the main actor, he was wooden & at times, overly dramatic and never convinced me of anything he was trying to convey. But I did like the idea of a Doctor playing the hero trying to save the world. Problem is, they needed someone much better and more appealing & believable than him to play that role. The leading lady was pretty but doesn't have much acting range either. To be fair tho, the script doesn't really help them out. The villain was laughable. He was so hammy I felt like he thought he was on a stage with his neighbourhood theatre group.I sound like I'm slamming the movie but truth is I sort of liked it. There's a goofy charm about it, even the bad of it - and it has an unpredictability and uniqueness that is really fascinating. I loved the imaginative and unusual kill methods, camera work and the special effects. I did laugh at points where I wasn't supposed to (at least I don't think I was!!) but that's OK. I laughed when the alien popped out of the dudes chest in Alien so I have an odd sense of humor. There's a scene towards the end of the movie involving the leading lady that I think was supposed to be scary & horrific but I just thought it was silly and laughed a lot. The movie never really developed any sense of dread or suspense. None of the characters ever seemed particularly scared or even mildly wary (apart from the guy in the very first scenes. He was actually the most convincing of anyone). The actors weren't helped by the directing which somehow seemed to leach away any chance the movie had to develop an atmosphere or creep the viewer out.I would love to see this remade by someone much more competent because I think it has the germ of a brilliant movie. As it is the movie is just mediocre. Worth a look & good for a laugh but definitely belongs in the average range.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
181,ryangilmer007,halloween...scary...huh....,3,11 March 1999,"Someone once told me that this movie (Halloween III) was the scariest movie that they ever saw.  For about 10 minutes, I may have agreed with them.  BUT what starts out as an interesting beginning (the setting and then the zombie-like drones going after a man who visited their town)  turns into something indescribable and utterly stupid.  As a movie in the Halloween series, this movie makes no sense (no Michael Myers or even a connection to him (which would have been simple to do).  As a movie about Halloween it is at least bearable (with a story about masks and the threat of putting your life in the hands of a mask).  As a horror movie, what?  The story is more stupid than scary. To a little kid a killer mask may be scary, but that is not the audience (with its rating).  Anyway,  Amityville II: The Possession was released in the same year and even it had scarier points and more prolonged scary aspects (despite the fact that it has a lot of downfalls).

Damn that's nice. Oh and that insanely catchy Silver Shamrock song. So much memorable from such a strange, casually plot irrelevant movie. It doesn't really do one thing exceptionally well - besides presentation. The plot is fine, silly verging on nonsensical.

I kept looking online to see if there wasn't an actual one with Michael Myers. But I finally concluded that this was indeed part of the series. The first question I asked was where the f**k was M.M? Although it says Halloween III, its just trying to fool you. It should really be called, ""Hey, did you like the first two Halloweens with Michael Myers? Then you'll like this third one that doesn't have anything to do with the first two and is just its own f*****g thing."" What a disappointing disgrace to the series. They should be ashamed of themselves for calling this Halloween III. More like Halloween f**kballs.The plot involves a police officer who goes on to an investigation of the murder of a women's dad. It leads up to him finding out about an evil scheme by a mask maker that is planning to insert chips in masks so when kids where them and watch the kids Halloween channel, the chips will set of a shock that will kill them.This is literally the dumbest horror film plot I've ever heard of. Not just because its nothing like the others, but because its stupid in general. How lame can you get?Whose bright idea was it to make a Halloween film without the villain. You can't have a Halloween film without Michael Myers, no matter what!!! Hey guys, I got an idea, lets make another Halloween film called Halloween III: Season of the Witch. But instead of making it an actual part of the series, lets f**k the original story and make up our own bulls**t. Other guy: wait, so were not making another Halloween film. Retard: no, its gonna be called that, but it won't have anything to do with the others.

187,refinedsugar,Bait & Switch,5,31 July 2000,"Halloween 3 has always been looked down upon for easy to see reasons. With no relation to past films in the series nor future installments, it disrupted the flow of what fans expected and/or wanted from the brand. Perhaps there wouldn't have been this historical backlash if they had dropped the Halloween moniker, but alas they didn't.I'm not going to dive into specifics of the plot, but I will say H3's concept is at the very least novel. It's not particularly deep or even logical. You'll notice holes abound if you start thinking. However this isn't the type of film meant to be able to stand up to scrutiny. Featuring the touches and talent of people involved in the earlier films, H3 delivers a legit moment or two of fright and a side order of gore. It just so happens these scary moments are trapped behind the silly machinations of everything a sub-par 80's horror movie were made of.For my dollar, H3's strongest assets are Tom Atkins and Dan O'Herlihy. Atkins does the flawed good guy / hero / main character justice. He feels real, he's always two steps behind. While O'Herlihy as the prerequisite villain gets some of the best dialog and/or speeches. Oh sure those gruesome effects, the creepy musical score and the wickedly dark ending are positive notches too, but Season of the Witch isn't by any means a great film.

189,shaun98,Just as bad as its reputation suggests,2,24 April 2002,"""Halloween III"" is the worst of the series. Not because of Michael's absence, but because it's a major bore, plain and simple. There's the germ of a good idea: a mysterious death is linked to an evil warlock, who plots an elaborate scheme to return the holiday to its darker roots. The concept is intriguing, but the execution is silly at best and irritating at worst. Did they really have to keep showing that damned Shamrock commercial? Once or twice is enough as it is.Generally speaking, the performances are stilted and wooden, especially from Tom Atkins. I suspect that merely reflects the actors' boredom; they don't seem to find the material any more exciting than the viewer. Dan O'Herlihy is the only one who seems to be enjoying himself. I wonder if he had second thoughts upon viewing the completed film.Upon retrospect, it was probably unwise of John Carpenter to attempt to make the popular franchise an anthology series. Most people who pay to get in a movie with the ""Halloween"" name expect to see the masked Michael Myers. Therefore it is no surprise that audiences openly rebelled, and the third installment bombed at the box office. With the benefit of a full two decades between then and now, we can examine the situation dispassionately, and ask, ""is ""Halloween III"" a good movie after all?"" Sadly, the answer is a resounding ""no!"" It was awful back then, and time has not been kind to the film.

192,Lucabrasisleeps,Interesting movie but with many flaws,6,24 January 2015,"I know that this movie does not involve Michael Myers so I was very much prepared to just view this movie as a stand alone horror movie. I see that the movie generally has divided viewers and there are people who are praising the movie to the skies and others who think it is junk. Frankly I thought that while it is an interesting movie, it has too many flaws that prevent the movie from being the best of the sequels. I love the soundtrack! John Carpenter's soundtracks have been amazing and here too, they make a mark. It reminded me of the Thing soundtrack but maybe a little faster especially towards the end. I have a soft spot for these electronic themes of 80s movies. Other positive aspects are the movie's premise and the performance of Dan O'Herlihy as Cochran. There are some standout scenes especially the scene where Cochran explains the motivation. This character has to be one of the most evil characters in horror movies. The idea itself is quite controversial and that, in my opinion, makes this movie very unique. The ending is quite stylish.In the last 30 minutes or so, the movie descends into corny territory with some ridiculous deaths and scenes which don't really make sense. What is the point of that whole ""throwing the chips down and killing everyone"" stuff? That whole robot hand scene was also lame. I guess these things are common in 80s horror movies. But still we expect better things from a movie produced by John Carpenter. The whole romance thing was really contrived and annoying to watch. The lines are so cheesy. How come we always see men and women jumping into bed immediately in 80s films despite being in big trouble? I also didn't like the male lead too much. There are a few scenes which are maybe added to increase the running time. Overall I actually liked it but there are maybe there are way too many flaws for me to recommend the movie. It could have been a classic with the premise but too much cheesiness ruins it and makes it a somewhat average movie.6/10",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
193,TheMovieDoctorful,"Forget Michael Myers, It's A Terrible Movie All On Its Own",1,3 November 2018,"In a way, Halloween III: Season of the Witch has much in common with the previously reviewed Spider-Man 3. Both are third installments of beloved franchises with unique ideas and botched deliveries that have gained massive cult followings over the years. However, the key difference is that Spider-Man 3's ideas were good and Halloween III's were not. No, I don't hate Halloween III because of its absence of Michael Myers. The presence or absence of The Shape does not a bad Halloween movie make; the best stuff in Rob Zombie's somewhat underrated Halloween II has nothing to do with Myers. I hate Halloween III because it's terrible in numerous ways all on its own. Rumor has it that Carpenter made the film after critic Rex Reed threatened to retire from filmmaking if the series continued after Halloween II, and that would definitely show in the final product.Halloween III is a film of firsts for the franchise. One of those firsts is that it contains the franchise's first romance. Surprise, it's awful. Even as a fan of this franchise, I'd be lying if I said the first 3 entries didn't have numerous misogynistic tropes. Halloween III is the worst offender, with a sleazy romantic subplot surrounding Tom Atkins and a ripe teenager played by Stacey Nelkin. This subplot only exists to emasculate its male audience, the gruff and strapping Atkins an audience stand-in for the same middle aged creeps who cheered on the deaths of the harlots in the first 2 Halloween films. This time, they can fantasize about having their very own naive, obedient, underage sex object all to themselves. It's not like John Carpenter and Tommy Lee Wallace gave her any actual character of her own beyond being an accessory of Atkins manhood. It's sadly no surprise that this was one of the first scenes filmed, everything about this production was sleazy and gross. Atkins' performance is pure machismo with nothing in the way of depth or emotional vulnerability, bar his comically over-the-top acting in the film's ending. Apparently, much like the awful Halloween (2018), this movie believes that feelings and emotional vulnerability are for women.The musical score is one of the worst I've ever heard, how it's gained such an appreciation among its fans is completely beyond me. It's obnoxious, lazy and, above all, repetitive. It will often loop tracks over and over again, sounding like a cat repeatedly pressing a key on a synthesizer. As someone currently going to film school, I can tell you right now that I have freshmen friends and peers who could create more inventive and atmospheric musical scores than the irritating and mind-numbing excuse for music displayed here. How anyone could hear the dark, grimy and industrial score of Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers and somehow call the jumbled up compilation of electronic noise from Halloween III is well beyond me.I find it baffling how the Horror community at large rightfully acknowledges cheap jump scares and lazy and crap, yet they somehow still defend a film like this that depends on them constantly. They're never earned through the film's atmosphere or through well handled build up or tension either, they just pop up when you least expect them like the world's most annoying jack-in-the-box. Each one accompanied by, you guessed it, an awkward and misplaced synth noise.The tone is absolutely all over the place. For as much as everyone wants to praise this film for ""being different"" and ""capturing the spirit of Halloween"", that's its only real identity. Sometimes, it wants to be incredibly dark and edgy with the brutal murder of children and the introduction of the theoretically disturbing murderous, supernatural Cult aspect of the Halloween series, other times it aims for straight cheese and goofiness with painfully bad comic relief that feels straight out of an awful 80s sitcom, laughable kill scenes (One victim is dispatched by getting his eyes poked, another is killed by a magic laser), corny overacting from Tom Atkins and O'Herlihy and a ridiculous and incoherent story that could only be interpreted as camp. That's without mentioning all of the horrendous and unsubtle foreshadowing this film does to its revelation on the lethal masks. Much like Trick r' Treat, the film apparently questions the intelligence of its viewers so much that it needs to force feed us a million lines of awful dialogue to hint at its major twist (""What bonding process?"" ""Don't ask me"", ""Hey Mr. Cochran, what is the final process?"" ""Lets just say a bit of this and a bit of that."", ""I still can't figure out why they won't take my orders for next year."", ""Maybe we're not gonna have Halloween next year!"")Conal Cochran is one of the worst villains in film history. Take any of the dozens of boring corporate millionaire bad guys from the MCU films, strip him of any and all relatable or interesting motivations and make him more evil and that's Chochran's entire character. He's neither scary nor funny nor fascinating in any way and Dan O'Herlihy clearly has no idea how to play him. Sometimes he goes for comical and over-the-top, sometimes he goes straight faced and serious. He clearly toys with Tom Atkins' character, yet immediately dispatches anyone else who's in on his scheme with the utmost speed and silence. And the reason why is because there is virtually no character here other than ""billionaire who's evil for the sake of being evil."" There's no nuance or dimension or depth here, just 2 extremes of personality caught in a terrible and poorly written character.I hate this movie. It's sexist, overacted, poorly characterized, tonally inconsistent, unfunny, unscary and just a bad idea from the original. It was terrible back in 1981 and it's terrible now and for reasons that have nothing to do with Michael Myers.

I mean 3,7 come on! You know what I think killed this film; the fans. Everyone was expecting Michael Meyers, well why? That story was finished in Halloween 2. The idea was to finish the Halloween franchise, but with new ideas. Each time a new horror. It started with Meyers in two movies, and should then go into completely different stories. Only problem was, people was expecting Meyers in the third film, so they got what they wanted in Halloween 4. But then they were suddenly tired of the character, and it became the typical boring sequel. but now, the only stand-out film is Halloween 3, and suddenly it looks kinda strange. I think had the franchise been allowed to walk the way it was supposed to be, this one would have been liked a lot more.For the story itself, it's original. I mean it's very unpredictable, and has a lot of tension. And what more do you need from a good horror film. As said before, it has a few quirky moments, and the budget keeps it a little down.

198,MetalGeek,Unjustly hated sequel is actually better than most of what followed...,6,28 October 2010,"""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" is probably one of the most unjustly hated horror films of all time. Most fans of the series refuse to acknowledge the fact that it even exists, simply because it doesn't feature the masked slasher Michael Myers. Their loss.The idea behind ""Halloween III"" probably seemed logical at the time. Michael Myers had been blown up and burnt to a crisp at the end of the previous film, so the producers decided that they would simply continue the series with a new, unrelated horror film under the ""Halloween"" banner every year. Toxic fanboy reaction and anemic box office returns for ""Season of the Witch"" quickly showed them the error of their ways and thus all of the ""Halloween"" films that have followed over the years brought back Mr. Myers in an increasingly silly parade of non-essential sequels. (I mean, seriously, have you seen ""Halloween: The Curse of Michael Myers"" or ""Halloween: Resurrection?"" Ugh.) As for ""Halloween III,"" it may not be a perfect film but Lord knows it's certainly better than many of the Myers retreads that followed in its wake. Director Tommy Lee Wallace takes the viewer out of the slasher realm entirely and plunges us into an exceedingly dark, sci-fi tinged tale of modern day witchcraft on a global scale, with a plot to kill millions of American children (!) on Halloween. Genre vet Tom Atkins (of ""Escape From New York"" and ""Maniac Cop"" fame) leads the cast as Dan Challis, a recently divorced doctor with a penchant for drinking, who is unlucky enough to be on hospital duty when a crazed man is brought into the E.R., clutching a rubber Halloween mask in his fist and repeatedly saying ""They're going to kill us all!"" Shortly thereafter, the man (who happens to be placed in the unlucky room number 13) gets his skull crushed by a mysterious, business suited intruder who then blows himself up in the hospital parking lot. When the dead man's daughter ""Ellie"" (the attractive Stacey Nelkin)arrives at the hospital and reveals to Challis that the last place he was seen alive was at the Silver Shamrock Halloween mask factory, he agrees to accompany her to the factory and find out if anything sinister is going on.The Silver Shamrock factory sits in the deceptively happy looking town of Santa Mira, where TV cameras watch your every move and all residents have a 6 PM curfew. Challis and Ellie shack up together at the local motel (shoe-horning in a quick romantic subplot that seems unnecessary at best, but at least we get to see Ellie in lingerie) with some other Silver Shamrock customers, all of whom are of course doomed to meet horrible fates before the movie's end. Turns out that the owner of the Silver Shamrock company, a charming looking old Irish guy named Cochran (a hilariously sinister turn by Dan O'Herlihy) is an old school Druid who's planning a Halloween ""trick"" to end all tricks on the Big Day. All of his company's masks contain a tiny transmitter that is set to activate (with fatal results) on Halloween night when a child wearing it watches the company-sponsored ""Big Giveaway"" on television. (By the way, it will be impossible not to get that damned ""Silver Shamrock"" TV commercial jingle stuck in your head for the next several days after viewing this film.) We get to watch the company ""test"" one of the masks on a suburban family and the gooey results will be a gorehound's delight. Needless to say, Atkins must escape from the madman's clutches and struggle to warn the population before zero hour.Sure it sounds looney, and it actually is quite a ridiculous plot, but the movie totally sells it. Plot holes abound (was Ellie a robot the entire time? How the hell did Cochran's company manage to steal a piece of Stonehenge? Are American kids THAT susceptible to TV ads that they'd all wear one of only three different Halloween masks nationwide? How are those snakes and bugs able to spontaneously generate from within the masks?), but the film moves along briskly enough from one shock to the next without giving the viewer much time to worry about it. The ending is likewise one of the bleakest in '80s horror history.Say what you want about ""Halloween III"" but one thing's for sure, it's definitely not another run of the mill slasher flick. It's a nice mix of elements from the creeping paranoid sci-fi/horror flicks of the '50s (well, hell, Santa Mira was also the setting of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" y'know) and the gory, synthesizer-driven horror flicks of the '80s (seriously, the score by John Carpenter himself and Alan Howarth is creepy as hell). I can't help but think that if this film had originally been released as ""Season of the Witch"" back in 1982, without the ""Halloween"" tag attached to it, that it would be more fondly remembered by horror geeks today.Unless you're one of those hardcore ""No Michael Myers, no Halloween"" fanboys, ""III: Season of the Witch"" is worth a look and deserves to be part of your annual Halloween Horror viewing slate.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

So, in that sense, Season of the Witch is an oddity.To its credit, the film makes a concerted effort to put a unique spin on the Stonehenge/Druid mythos that's mentioned only briefly in Halloween II (and is apparently the primary influence behind the sinister motivations of both Michael and the unlikely villains featured in the series' third installment). Instead of there being a single ""slasher"" who's driving the action/suspense, this time around it's a company called Silver Shamrock that produces a series of Halloween masks for children. These aren't ordinary masks, though; they're outfitted with a chip—that also contains bits from a stolen Stonehenge block—that, when worn in front of a television set playing a specific jingle and image combination, causes its wearer to convulse, begin vomiting bugs, and to shrivel into a quivering flesh pile.Uhwhat?I'm fine with the writers playing up the pagan mythology as one of the driving forces behind the evil taking place, but what happens in Season of the Witch is just a little too far-fetched. Suspension of disbelief is a requisite for a movie like this, but what the movie hopes for—at least in many key sequences—is unbridled stupidity. Though unquestionably a work of horror (literally, figuratively, and whichever other way you want to take it), the movie is also a detective story. The leads here are played by a mustached protagonist who's a divorcée and emergency room M.D., as well as the daughter of a small business owner who's father died in mysterious circumstances involving Silver Shamrock. To go into any more depth about the ridiculousness of the plot and the hammy love story that ensues would be pointless, so I'll conclude by simply saying that Season of the Witch is, far and away, the worst entry of the Halloween series.Did I mention that it also features killer robots wearing business suits? Yeah. And it's every bit as random as it sounds.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

I have to admit if Halloween 3 was a single movie out of the series it would be an okay movie but not as Halloween 3. I love the catchy song ""3 more days to Halloween, halloween, 3 more days to Haloween, Silver Shamrock"" The story is this mask making company make these makes that on Halloween if you are wearing them and watching this TV show the mask will kill you.

He just walks up to her and starts frenching her on the bed and they do it lol. It was so weird and random and gross.Maybe better leads who were closer in age could have elevated this film.

203,cwade22,Where are the sexy witches?,2,29 January 2019,"No Michael Myers, no sexy witches, what is this movie? There was one part that made me laugh. The part where the Black Homeless man(the only black person in the movie, I think) brought a dude in the hospital. Then, when the tv started playing weird music and the man started acting like to kill everybody, the black man was SMART and started to run away. I think everybody else died because they didn't run away. I was like ""yep! The black man is smart. Heard creepy music, starts to run."" His reaction was HILARIOUS! Sadly, that was the only entertaining part of the movie! They really should've just waited until the writers had a good 3rd movie WITH Michael, because this made no sense and was just boring. Like I can go to sleep to this movie. Then again, I fell asleep in my chair watching the First Halloween. Not sure why. I guess the pace, music made me sleepy. The concept of this could've worked. The concept of Michael is great, but these movies are sleepy. And I like The franchise more than Friday the 13th. Well, I mean, I think Michael is More Lethal than Jason. But I might sentimentally like Friday the 13th more. I'll say this, whenever I wear the Michael Mask, everybody gets scared! Even when I go get groceries. So, the only entertaining part of this movie was when the black homeless man goes to the hospital and then runs away. Haha! Sofa king funny just thinking about his reaction. If nothing else, everybody should watch only that part. How did this movie happen? And why did it go so badly? Wow!",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

And fall flat it did. The movie opens with a well done chase, murder, and ""suicide"" of the killer; it's downhill from there. The truly revolting deaths of the people who don the masks is only matched by the truly revolting sight of puffy, middle-aged Tom Atkins and barely 18, pretty Stacy Nelkin getting it on. Carpenter's music is metronomically irritating throughout. Dan O'Herlihy has fun as the campy villain, but what goes on around him is so un-fun that it cancels him out. An that ending. PUHLLLEEEZE.

205,GroovyDoom,Bustin' heads on Halloween,8,4 October 2000,"Critically panned and loathed by John Carpenter fans who were expecting another chapter in the saga of Laurie Strode vs. Michael Myers, ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" was actually an attempt by Carpenter and partner Debra Hill to break out of the ""Saga of the Shape"" story and make the ""Halloween"" series a franchise that dealt with horror on October 31. It failed as a project, but what it did give us is a one-of-a-kind movie that's pretty interesting in its own right. What other movie can you think of that tells a story about a Druid maskmaker plotting to murder millions of children on Halloween with a bizarre scheme involving computer chips, Stonehenge, killer robots, laser beams, black magic, and the hopes that all the children with the cursed masks will coincidentally gather around the TV set at an appointed time to watch a strobing commercial that triggers the device on the mask. The results of this are not quite clear, but the masks melt, the children's heads disintegrate and hundreds of roaches, snakes, and other weird bugs emerge from the corpse. Mission accomplished.It's nowhere near as bad as you've heard, although it is pretty bad at times. The movie is flawed both technically and script-wise. If it sounds a little contrived, it is. Not only is the devilish mask-maker hoping that children will buy his masks, he only gives them three designs to pick from (what a cheapskate!). It's the kind of movie where they are trying to show a man climbing through a window, so they film him on one side of it, cut away, then film him on the other side, never actually showing him climb through. It's also the kind of movie that relies on the hero's ability to break out of any strap, disable a video monitor with the impossible toss of a rubber mask, climb through a convenient and surprisingly well-lit air duct, and suddenly learn how to reprogram an elaborate computer.Yet, the movie is unexpectedly jolting in certain areas. Characters we like die mercilessly along with the annoying characters, and there are some truly shocking moments of graphic violence. The story's cruel edge is gleefully displayed throughout. The thought of a witch sacrificing millions of kids on Halloween is genuinely disturbing, and yet there are absolutely no children in this movie that you would want to survive...they are all depicted as obnoxious, irritating creatures just begging for a killer laser beam aimed at them. The direction is terse, but it makes for a nightmarish quality to the whole thing. I don't want to spoil the ending, but let me just say it's true to the tone of the rest of the film.The cast is worth noting, too, particularly since the script is devoid of an actual hero. There is a protagonist, played by a very beefy Tom Atkins, but he is an alcoholic womanizer (is there any other kind?). He suddenly finds himself drawn into an investigation by the very spacey Stacey Nelkin, who is also personable but seems to be playing a role meant for Nancy Loomis/Kyes, who instead turns up in the film in a brief scene as Dan's bitter ex-wife. What thankless jobs they all had! Dan O'Herlihy easily steals the show as the cheerfully evil Druid witch, Conal Cochran.The electronic score is very atmospheric, and just try to ignore the grating commercial jingle that repeats throughout the movie. The idea is pretty original too, even with the gratuitous nods to ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"" (most of the action takes place in Santa Mira, California...apparently they traded their pods in for gears).Looking back, I'm glad they tried to abandon the Michael Myers story and try something different, seeing as how awful the following sequels were. ""Halloween III"" is a bad fim, but it's an enjoyable one, and you definitely don't know where it's going while it's happening. I just wish the execution of the movie would have been better. It begins wonderfully, carefully adding clues to the story, but falls apart about halfway through. If the script had gotten a re-write before production, it might have been a better movie. But even so, it remains a guilty pleasure, and memorable if only for its unapologetically wicked atmosphere.""Watch the magic pumpkin, kids! Watch!""",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
206,CowherPowerForever,The Night No One Comes Home,8,23 October 2014,"Halloween 3 is a special film for me as it showed the original creators of this franchise(John Carpenter and Debra hill) wanted to take a huge risk and branch out from the Michael Myers character. It was a giant risk, and really never payed off until the fan base grew over the past thirty two years. While the Michael Myers character is not in the film as everyone already knows, I truly believe this is one of the better films that is attached to this Halloween series. The following is my review of Halloween 3: Season of the Witch.The story was crafted by four different people. The original idea came from Nigel Kneale who later wanted his name removed from the production. John Carpenter and Debra Hill also had a hand in some of the ideas. In the end, the film was finally finished up by Tommy Lee Wallace, who actually ended up using sixty percent of the story that Kneale wrote. Wallace was not new to the Halloween series at this point, as he was the production designer and editor of the original Halloween film. He left the sequel, Halloween 2, because he did not like the story idea. This story is basically a giant corporation in a small farming town that has a bad idea that will come about on Halloween night. I frankly love this story that everyone I mentioned above was able to pull together. Sure there was no Michael Myers, but the story and execution was amazing in my opinion. When I first watched this movie many moons ago, I was disappointing that Michael was not in the film, and to this day it saddens me part three doesn't include the iconic character, but once you get past that, the film is one of the better films of the series. The original idea was to keep the Halloween name and make a new movie every year, but with a different story like we got in this film. That idea fell apart once this film was originally panned. Thankfully over the decades people came to their senses and appreciate this great film like I have. Even though Wallace will never get the fame that John Carpenter got, in my opinion he delivers a fantastic story.Tommy Lee Wallace also directed the film, and he really delivers that amazing 1980s style of film making. Nothing too flashy or overdone, but it draws you in with its looks. Filming on location in small towns really makes the film look even more creepy with those fantastic night scenes they use to love filming. With a new story, also came some new actors. The star of the film is Tom Atkins, along with co-star Stacey Nelkin. Both play off of each other nicely in the film. Dan O'Herlihy delivers a wonderful performance as the evil business owner. His performance is a joy to watch. With the hate that this film has received for so many years, it is finally nice to see all these actors get their glory for a great film they all came together and made. Even though some like to nitpick this film, I'm personally glad I didn't decide to give up on this film like some Halloween purists have. Overall, Tommy Lee Wallace delivers a great film that most Halloween and horror fans in general should love. Take off your blinders and tell yourself before the film that this is no Michael Myers film, and you should very much enjoy this film.John Carpenter and Alan Howarth are back scoring this Halloween film. While the score is different, that John Carpenter style of 1980s music is still in full swing. While many feel now that the usage of the Synthesizer was cheesy, and it may have been for that time the film was made, I truly feel using the Synthesizer was brilliant. The scoring has so much depth, and I love it as much as I love the scores for the first two Halloween films that Carpenter did. While I cannot say the score on this film tops the score on the original Halloween film, it might be the second best right next to Halloween 2.In closing, Halloween 3: Season of the Witch is a film that has been unfairly criticized for more than three decades, and just recently the fan base for the film is growing into what it should be. With the recent Blu-Ray special edition release of this film, hopefully a new generation of Halloween fans can watch the film for what it is, and enjoy all its greatness like I have. Do not listen to those who trash the film, as at the end of the day their hatred for the film comes down to the film not having Michael Myers in the film. That is simply not a good reason to trash such a great horror film.8/10",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
207,mungflesh,Not as bad as people think,8,18 August 2004,"I think Tommy Lee Wallace's ""Season of the Witch"" is an underrated classic. There are no points here for outstanding acting performances, or original plot etc (although I would like to add there's no dreadful acting) but bonus points for the music and direction, which go together to make a really creepy horror. It contains superb imaginative gore sequences, to rival the likes of ""The Fly"" or ""Dead & Buried"".Whereas the Michael Myers type slasher movies have done the genre to death, this one remains dusty and untouched. There aren't any other horror movies worth mentioning, like this. It is very sci-fi horror though, so I think if you've a problem with far-fetched content, you'd best avoid the film as you will find it ridiculous.I called it Season of the Witch in the first sentence, because I prefer to think of it as it's own movie, rather than having anything to do with the original classic ""Halloween"". This is the only problem with the movie.""Oh ... and Happy Halloween"".",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
208,moviemattb,A Solid Stand Alone Movie,8,15 October 2018,"With Michael Myers out of the picture, John Carpenter and Debra Hill thought the series itself should be an anthology that deals with different Halloween related stories. Unfortunately, everyone hated the movie, and wanted the same movie again with Michael Myers. Not ready for something new and different, huh? With that said, the movie acts as a stand alone movie, where the movie makes no mention of either Sam Loomis, Laurie Strode, or Michael Myers. The story follows about a doctor name Daniel Challis as he becomes suspicious about the situtation, where he meets a beautiful woman name Ellie Grimbridge as they go to Santa Mira by investigating the Silver Shamrock factory where they make Halloween mask, and being led by Conal Cochran. As things go south, Cochran explains his motivation that he is returning Halloween to its sacrificial origins by doing witchcraft, and killing innocent children. To whoever wears those Halloween mask, and watching the commercials, they will died and a bunch of insects and snakes come out of people's face. Its up to Challis to put an end of this nightmare. I will admit, when I first saw this movie, I did not like and never find it scary at all. I was on the same boat as others as this is a ""Halloween"" movie, but without Michael Myers. As the more I keep thinking about it, the more I've begun to appreciate for what it is. I appreciate for trying something different, but people just want the same movie, and don't want something original. In the trailers and the posters, they address that Michael Myers is not in the movie. They even said ""The Night No On Comes Home,"" but just didn't seem to capture anyone's attention. This was a time before the internet came along. Sometime in the future, they just need to learn their mistakes and go ""Okay, back then we weren't ready for something different, now we are and won't repeat the same mistake over again."" Not sure it will, but there is only one way to find out. Tommy Lee Wallace does a solid job for directing the movie. As a writer, he explains in the bonus features that he did not wrote the script, but did some re-write to the script as the credits mislead that he was the sole writer. The real writer was Nigel Kneale, who was not credit for the movie, but he deserves so as he wrote a solid script. The cinematography by Dean Cundey is filmed well once again, and the visuals themselves are fantastic. The movie does have that Carpenter vibe, which speaking of Carpenter, he also did the music with Alan Howarth and was able to make a different music for this movie, and really outstanding. The atmosphere is moody, and done well, while the effects are good for the most part. The performances are really good, especially for Stacey Nelkin, Tom Atkins, and wonderfully played by Dan O'Herlihy. If the movie wasn't part of the ""Halloween"" universe, especially, when its the third ""Halloween"" movie due to its title, then maybe the movie would have gotten great reviews. ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch,"" may not work as a sequel, but it works as a solid stand alone movie. Not perfect, but not that bad all. I say give it another chance. I'm giving it an 8 out of 10.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

213,Caps Fan,Something Different,6,31 October 2012,"Though I am a fan of the Halloween franchise, I am not one of those who thinks that Michael Myers is all there is to the series. Which is why I didn't share in the general disapproval of this film when it came out and – horrors! - Michael was not in it.The story begins with a man running in terror from some unknown menace. That menace, an oddly emotionless man, catches up with him and kills him in hospital. Doctor Dan Challis (Tom Atkins), who was treating him, looks into the background and discovers the truth - a strangely elaborate scheme by an Irish American businessman to use the Halloween masks he manufactures to massacre large numbers of children.The why of what's happening is not gone into in as much depth as we might like, but the story is mildly diverting nonetheless. The first victim's daughter turns up and becomes the doctor's sidekick. They encounter a small businesswoman who has come to complain about the masks and a family who have come to be rewarded for selling lots of them. All of them suffer unfortunate demises.Some of the trimmings are quite interesting. A background story about the theft of part of Stonehenge turns out to be more significant than we initially suspect. And who would have thought that TV commercials could be wielded to such deadly effect?The music isn't bad and the cliffhanger ending is actually rather good. Our journey to that cliffhanger, however, is too long. The film meanders all over the place telling a story that just doesn't need that much time.Some critics complained about excessive gore, but what did they expect in a ""Halloween"" film?

(I heard a rumor that people in California got all uppity about this and nearly rioted in some cinemas.)
Did you people not read the novel of Halloween 3 by Jack Martin? Your boy, Myers, was in fact in Season of the Witch believe it, or not. He stalks Dr. Challis at the start.I applaud Carpenter, and Hill, for going in a different direction than the unstoppable white masked killer with their intended anthology of ""other"" Halloween story lines. Sadly we didn't get any more after Season of the Witch so back by popular demand was a string of countless other Myers-themed story lines, which were all horrendous, and far fetched, in their own right - the next one more sillier than the last. Remind me again, how many sequels came after Season of the Witch? I lost count.How can you not love the score by Alan Howarth in Season of the Witch? One piece of music is titled ""Chariots of Pumpkins,"" (My favorite,) and that other authentic catchy, ""8 more days till Halloween, Halloween. 8 more days till Halloween, Silver Shamrock."" You can't go wrong with that.OK, if you wanna talk about drawbacks, and why I've deducted one point from this movie, it's because of one, or two, minor things.1 - Why did this robot put gloves on in the hospital? Was he afraid of leaving fingerprints? He suicides right after, so what was the point of putting on leather gloves?2 - It's called Season of the Witch when in fact our villain is male, so technically it should be called Season of the Warlock. But in this day and age you're not allowed to refer to people as him, or her, anymore. So by rights it should probably be called Season of the Druid maybe?3 - My 2 main gripes is that the skeleton creature on the old video cover wasn't in the actual movie and this line at the 25:57-minute mark irks me a tad, ""Irish Halloween masks?"" ""California? You never know."" Um, Halloween originated from Ireland or England. It's not an American tradition.The creepy townsfolk of Santa Mira are eerily reminiscent of the curious locals in Nilbog when Challis and Ellie arrive.Did Little Buddy flip his own mother the middle finger just then?Look - there's Karate Kid music playing here as Marge Guttman tampers with the deadly laser chip thingy. Then she resembles a baddie from ""They Live"" for her efforts.What a coincidence, Halloween falls on a Sunday this year same as in the movie.Can't believe that Dan O'herily went from playing a villain to a lizard in The Last Starfighter.You know, Betty Kupfer didn't actually die in test room A, she only fainted. So she could return in Halloween 3.2 as the witch from the old school VHS cover in the reimagined sequel.Wait a minute.... why didn't Ellie die too when Challis tips the box of deadly poker chips over all the other robots?It's a quaint movie filmed in the neat little town of Loleta, Northern California. One of my regrets in life was travelling up the 101, or 104, asleep on a Greyhound at two in the morning not knowing we had just passed this little town in the dead of night. Had I known I would have got off.Halloween 3 was brave enough to tell a different story about October 31, like Trick 'R' Treat, and didn't rely on the unstoppable Michael Myers character which all those other flops did.One thing I like to do when Halloween 3: Season of the Witch finishes is to pop on Carpenter's ""The Fog"" where we see Dr. Challis pick up Laurie Strode and I pretend that ""The Fog"" is the aftermath of Season of the Witch.

219,RomanJamesHoffman,Boo Hoo! It doesn't have Michael Myers in itget over it! It's a good horror movie.,7,27 July 2013,"Halloween 3: Season of the Witch is a movie which suffers an unfortunate dual fate from its inclusion in the Halloween horror franchise. On the one hand, Michael Myers fanboys deride the movie for its absence of the aforementioned anti-hero and it is easy to see that the movie may have fared better review-wise had it not been part of such a glorified lineage. On the other hand, while reviews may have been more favourable, had it just been called Season of the Witch (Or something else, as George A Romero had released a movie of the same name ten years beforewhich I also recommend) it's highly doubtful that many people (including myself) would have seen it.Okay. So where's Michael Myers? Well, even though Myers grew into a supernatural figure with subsequent instalments of the franchise, it should be noted that the first two Halloween movies never explicitly suggested this. Sure he was shot and fell out of a window at the end of the first film, but the fact that Halloween 2 picks up immediately after the first means that it's conceivable that he was wounded but so high on adrenalin that his injuries hadn't registered yetmuch like soldiers who are shot in war but don't realise it immediately. However, at the end of the second movie the grim visage of Michael Myers was well and truly dispatched. So, in light of this John Carpenter envisioned subsequent sequels to each be stand alone pieces tied together by taking place at Halloween. A good idea, I thinkexcept that after the relatively disappointing sales of Halloween 3 Michael Myers was quickly resurrected and haunted several more (increasingly poor and ridiculous) sequels.The film itself is not a slasher, as there is no masked lunatic hunting down hot teens, but instead focuses on the machinations of a curious company called Silver Shamrock which in the run up to the Halloween holiday is marketing a range of ominous looking masks. After some curious incidents, Dan (Tom Atkins) becomes suspicious of the company and digs a bit deeper to find out what's really going on and soon finds himself privy to some grotesque events as he learns the full magnitude of the company's malevolence. Okay, the climax is probably a bit weak with the whole ludicrous Stonehenge bit, but on either side of this is one of the darkest story lines I've seen in a horror (courtesy of director Tommy Lee Wallace, who would go onto direct the TV adaptation of Stephen King's IT). Honestly, for sheer nightmare-come-alive horror, I have yet to see anything to match the scene when we see Dan impotently observing the tragedy of a family trialling the masks. Along with a truly eerie John Carpenter score (reminiscent of Ennio Morricone's score for Carpenter's own The Thing, released the same year) Halloween 3: Season of Witch evokes all your worst nightmares as it effectively creates a believable world in which we helplessly watch the horror unfold.Forget Michael Myers.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

I found some symbolism in this movie and it was how at this time in 1982-1983, Kids we're into TV 24/7 and the funky Silver Shamrock commercial was a staple in millions of children's lives, they would sit down in front of the TV and rock back and forth and sing along to the goofy song. It's really creepy if you actually think about what is going on. Tom Atkins (a Carpenter movie regular from the eighties, mostly notably 'The Fog') plays a great role as Dr. Challis and his quest to find out what the hell is going on. I must say this movie stands alone on its own pedestal amongst other movies of its type. I recommend it to anybody who is into horror flicks with a freaky side to them, some graphic gore but for the most part it's pretty clean, it's just the psychological aspect of this movie which makes it so darn creepy! Awesome job by Director Wallace, I just wish it was called something other than Halloween III, oh well. Enjoy!!!",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

222,A-Ron-2,I can't believe that people are STILL talking about this movie,2,8 February 2000,"With that said, I am about to say something as well ;)I had initially looked this film up mostly on a lark, assuming that there would not have been any comments written on it in quite some time.  I was surprised to see that 15 years after I first endured this film in the theater that people continue to debate its merits/failings.  This is a bad film, pretty much from beginning to end.  It suffers from terminal plot problems and ridiculously bad conception.  Originally Carpenter wanted the Halloween series to be a yearly film event that would showcase different directors and unique story lines, however, after he made the original sequel himself and included Micheal Myers, most of us fans were to assume that this would be an MM film.Well, we were wrong.  I knew ahead of time that MM was not to be in the film, and I was excited about this ""yearly event"" thing finally kicking off. I went in with high hopes, which were dashed immediately.  I wont give away any of the outlandish things that occurred in this film, but lets just say that I enjoy suspending my disbelief and am willing to go just about anywhere that a film wants to take me.  I rarely question a film while I am watching it, but I found myself audibly asking ""what the h***"" several times (as well as hearing other people say the same thing).  The whole theater just sort of walked out in a daze without looking back.Actually, I did look back.  A few years ago I finally screwed up my stomach to watch the film again, hoping that perhaps I had been wrong all those years ago, and it had only been my youth that undermined my appreciation of the film... well, it is worse the second time around.  I rarely write bad reviews of films anywhere, but with this film, I really dont have anything else to say.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

224,LinkGoku,not horrible but not good either,6,15 February 2010,"the thing i didn't like about this movie at first glance was that the the movie had no resemblance to the first two Halloween movies, but at second glance i noticed the good acting, the interesting storyline, the addicting song (hey all the Halloween movies have had repetitive songs), but on the down side, i didn't feel like there was much effort put into this movie, the graphics were weak, the storyline as interesting as was left me questioning a bit, and as interesting an idea as john carpenter had to change each Halloween movies storyline i must say i don't think it was a good idea at all, so in the long run i think this movie is worth seeing at least once, then you can make your decision on if you like Halloween III: The Season of the Witch",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
225,jrs-8,It's not that bad!!,5,29 October 2002,"This is a guilty pleasure. It's certainly not meant to be taken seriously in the least. ""H3SOTW"" is high camp plain and simple. How could you think it was anything else? A small town where the curfew is 6pm? A villain who runs a mask factory with an employee list filled with robots? A scheme to kill as many children as possible with the deadly masks? Stonehenge? Come on people!! This movie has its tongue planted firmly in cheek.Of course it's dumb. That's the point. What other reason to explain the villain's diabolical plot that, if successful, would knock him out of business? What would he have left to gain? Sure it's explained that he is the king of practical jokes. But then the joke is on him. So he fails and the joke is on the audience for taking this all seriously.Like almost every other person commenting here, I could spend days pointing out how dumb it is. But if you don't take it seriously in the least I think it's a watchable 90 minute film.The performances are all passable. Tom Atkins is credible in the lead. Stacey Nelkin is a very sexy leading lady (even if her last scene is played minus her head) and one wonders why her career hasn't amounted to more. But it's Dan O'Herlihy as the bad guy, Cochran, who stands out. He hams it up with the best of them without ever going over the top. He's menacing and totally believable in the midst of an unbelievable situation. He is convincing enough to almost make us swallow it all.The one major problem is the overt violence. It is way over the top. Had it been toned down you could almost see this as a black comedy.
I am not suggesting that this is a classic by any means. It provides a few chills and entertains in a drive-in B movie kind of way. I give the filmmakers credit for at least trying something different unlike all of the other ""Halloween"" films that would follow. If you have 90 minutes to kill you could do much worse. In my mind this is the best of the series after the classic original.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
226,Phantasm01,I'm aware & others are that there's no Michael Myers in it..,6,2 August 2006,"First of all, I do NOT hate this film because it leaves out ""Beloved Michael."" I knew full well going into it that it was a completely new story, and was well prepared for something different. I don't hate this movie because it's different, I hate it because it's bad. Michael Myers and the rest of the Halloween series is the only reason why this film even got a DVD release in the first place. There is a reason why Halloween 4 went back to the Michael Myers story line. I know there are people out there who don't believe that this is a monumentally stupid film. And since I have my collection of bad horror that I love and everyone else hates, I'm not going to slight them for that. I'm just going to do my best to explain why I personally don't feel that people should watch this movie under any circumstances.First of all, there is no Michael Myers. Our ""story"" centers around two people, a man and a woman, who are out to uncover a conspiracy that a company selling children's Halloween masks is really trying to make spiders, snakes, and other icky stuff crawl out of the kids' heads at exactly the same moment. For reasons far too ridiculous to recount here, the masks will cause this to happen on Halloween night when children all over the country will gather around their TV sets for something called ""The Big Giveaway."" Now, I know that this movie is trying to make some sort of crappy point about commercialism. But why would a corporation even want to do that? They got theirs when they convinced the kids' parents to shell out the money for those trendy masks. Is it some sort of human sacrifice for the God of Corporate Greed? I suppose it could be seen as a lousy metaphor for the negative influence of advertising on children, but they couldn't come up with anything better than this? Now what really burns me up about the anti-commercialism message is not the fact that it's a poorly constructed metaphor, but the blatant hypocrisy of it all. This is called ""Halloween 3"" because it takes place on Halloween. Clever, huh? Well, ""Halloween 3"" is not just a clever title. They used that title for this movie so that all the idiots who loved the first two Halloween movies would rush out and see this craptacular travesty of cinema, believing it to be the next in the series. (Idiots like myself, perhaps?) Exploiting the success of a popular horror franchise with a third-rate sequel? That is commercialism at its worst! At one point, the man and the woman have to check into a hotel. The man says something that I will roughly translate here as, ""Hey, we're both pretty unattractive, I'm a lot older than you, there is zero sexual tension between us, and more importantly, we have to get moving to stop all those kids from having spiders and snakes crawl out of their heads. But since you're a woman, and I'm a man, and we're in a hotel room right now, can we have sex?"" Now if this were a REAL Halloween movie, Michael Myers would come and kill them. As we know from watching the first Halloween film, the source of Micheal's angst is that he knows that sex must only be enjoyed within the confines of the sacred bond of holy matrimony. And these two tramps are breaking his rule! But alas, this is a faux Halloween movie, and you will find yourself hoping against hope that these two one-dimensional characters will be killed off.It occurs to me that Micheal's mask is so much cooler than any of the dorky masks the kids are wearing. If they tried to make this an anti-commercialism movie by mass marketing his image as a serial killer, and selling kids masks that looked like HIS, it might be a little more interesting. But of course, that is like saying that watching paint dry on an artist's canvas is more interesting than watching paint dry on a white wall.A lot of people think this movie sucks because Michael Myers isn't in it. But if this garbage never purported to be a Halloween movie in the first place, and was released under a completely different title, it would still suck! (What title would that be anyway? ""Season of the Witch""? I'm not exactly sure where that came from. I know it's a rather odd George Romero movie about a bored housewife, but this movie doesn't have anything to do with that movie, or witches, for that matter.) ""Halloween 3: Season of the Witch"" is bad for reasons that having nothing to do with how good the Halloween series was before this godawful entry.After you watch part 2 forget about part 3. Don't worry about watching part 4 later, and not knowing what's going on, because it won't matter. If you rent the Halloween movies, just pretend that the video store clerks left a crappy, unrelated movie in between part 2 and the next in the series, which they did. I am doing everything I can to repress the memory of this movie, but you can stop it before it starts.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
227,BenTramerLives78,A great stand alone film,9,1 October 2020,"Halloween iii: Season of the Witch is very entertaining. I don't understand why people bash it so much.

228,mf2812,Criminaly Underrated.,10,31 October 2018,"There are reviews on here from as late as 2015 slating this movie which is complete bulls**t. The movie was released 30 years ago. If you haven't caught the news that Michael Myers wasn't in this in the 30 years or so it's been out and that's your complaint about the movie then your argument is null and void. I can fully understand if you actually went to the cinema at the time under the illusion that Myers was as it really was kinda hidden by the producers. Sorry, I just had to get that out.Now, onto the movie.Pure 80's cheese with awesome kill scenes, a fantastic score which John Carpenter even admits as he said he had little else to do so he made it as good as he (and partner in crime Alan Howarth) could. AND Tom Atkins! C'mon, what else do you want?! Maybe one of the most heinous ""bad guys"" in cinematic history! Let's not downplay this, he was trying to kill every child in America!Plus, this movie has FAR more elements of the Halloween holiday and the ancient traditions. The first could have been set any night of the year, but just because it had a few pumpkins in scenes it's now synonymous with Halloween. The original was actually going to be called ""The Babysitter Murders"" until Irwin Yablans came up with setting it on Halloween.Anyway, at this time of posting this (Halloween night, 2018) it still has a rating of only 4.8. which is nonsense. This movie deserves at least a 6.5.But hey-ho, Michael Myers fan-boys are always gonna moan. I fully expect this review to be downrated to hell but I'm okay with that.

229,boondocksaint20,"This is without a doubt, THE WORST MOVIE OF ALL TIME!",1,13 June 2003,"And I've seen some really awful movies before...but this one takes the cake by far.  Now, I am not one of those reviewers who would say such a thing lightly, nor am I one that says that about every movie I didn't like (I see the same reviewers on here say that every single movie they didn't like is what they believe to be the worst movie of all time, and I don't think that is right.  Calling a movie the worst ever is, afterall, a bold statement). On my top ten list of worst movies of all time, Halloween 3:  Season of the Witch has the 'honor' of being number 1, and it's been up there for the past 6 or 7 years.  And this has absolutely nothing to do with the fact that Michael Myers isn't in it...especially b\c this was the first one of the series that I had ever seen, and honestly, it turned me off from the rest of the series until I saw the first one and ended up loving that one to watch the other installments of the series (which range from good to average).How embarrassing it must have been for John Carpenter and Debra Hill to both have had their names attached to this stinking pile of waste.  The plot is awful, acting is retched...and that damn 'Silver Shamrock' song...makes me want to drive rusty nails into my head to relieve myself from the pain. Literally, you hear the most annoying song of all time, the ""3 more days 'til Halloween, Halloween, Halloween...Silveerrrrrr Shamrock!"" song, played to the tune of 'London Bridge is Falling Down', and they play this horrible tune at least half a dozen times throughout.  If I had rented this stinker, I would have done exactly what one reviewer did, and burn, break and utterly destroy this movie to save others, who will undoubtedly be mistaken by the title, the pain and misery I endured.  Now, I love horror films, and I really loved the idea Carpenter had in the beginning, to make a different Halloween themed film every year...but after leaving the cliff hanger of the first one, the people demanded there be a sequel, which I thought was very good for a sequel...so with that said, it was almost impossible to make a good sequel after Myer's supposed demise in part 2...but that's no excuse for this mess!  It is horrible beyond comprehension...I mean some horror movies are made bad, but have redeeming qualities like effects, scares, etc...and even other bad horror flims are so bad they're good (tongue in cheek type of stuff)...but the worst movies of all time, in my book are the movies that are plain awful and tried so hard to be serious.  So unless you want to know what clawing your eyeballs out feels like...AVOID THIS ONE LIKE THE PLAGUE.  0/10 stars (if only there was such a rating).",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
230,Kirollos-Noah,Worst of the franchise!,3,25 October 2019,"Happy Halloween and welcome to my review of the third installment in the Halloween franchise, that doesn't deserve to be in that franchise at all: Halloween III: Season of the Witch.Halloween III: Season of the Witch was written and directed by Tommy Lee Wallace, and starring Tom Atkins, Stacey Nelkin, Dan O'Herlihy.Halloween III is not a follow-up to the previous 2, and that was shown in the movie, where Halloween 1978 was broadcasting on the TV, and this time the killer isn't Michael Myers, it's a punch of satanic Halloween masks which kill the children who wear them, Daniel Challis and Ellie Grimbridge are investigating the recent murders which are connected to those masks in a way or another.Halloween III: Season of the Witch is a bizarre movie, it holds the name of the franchise but it actually shows that the 1978 Halloween movie is just a movie, so nothing that happened in the previous 2 happened in that movie, so it's NOT a movie in the franchise, but it has the name of it, and that's massively disappointing, because when you hear the name ""Halloween franchise"" the first thing that comes into your mind is the white masked killer, Michael Myers, if you were gonna make a movie without him under the name of the franchise, at least don't show the movie on the TV and make a minor connection to the original!Halloween III isn't only bad because of the absence of Michael Myers, the movie is so poorly written, and all the characters are so bland, except for Conal Cochran, played by Dan O'Herlihy, and his character is also flawed! I found myself so not caring about any of the characters at all, not even the main leads, and that also be said because of the performances, Atkins and Nelkin were so not good, and the chemistry was so weird and bizarre, the only one was okay in the movie is Dan O'Herlihy, and that's about it!The idea of this movie is not bad, the execution though is terrible, the thrills are barely there, and the plot is just damaged and confusing, towards the end it even felt more like the whole movie was just a mistake, because our villain is so flawed, and that's because of his motivations, it could've been so much better if they didn't use any motivation at all, like the original Halloween movie, but Wallace decided to give him a very unconvincing motive that really drove me off the movie!The movie had a couple of good scenes in it, for instance the scene where the first kid was murdered by one of those Halloween masks, and the first act wasn't that terrible too, it's just everything after that was terribly terrible!Towards the end there's a scene where the leading character was trying to escape from somewhere, and the way he did it was one of the dumbest way that you could see in a movie! This is how this movie is so bad!The twists aren't there, because from the first act we got to know our villain, and the leading characters knew that too, so the thrills weren't there at all, nothing surprising happened in this movie, it even failed to be a horror movie, there were no good horror scene in this movie except for the first murder scene.There was like a final fight towards the end, and boy how was it funny, the problem is that they're insulting the people who are watching this movie with most of their action!The ending of this movie made the movie even more confusing, because you can't find out why this movie was even made at the first place if the ending is like that and we already knew the murderer from the first act, it will really get you questioning about what were they thinking about.Halloween III: Season of the Witch could have survived even without Michael Myers, but if the movie was a little bit self-aware, and the creator thought about it more seriously.I'm gonna give Halloween III: Season of the Witch a D, I think it's one of the worst, if not the worst of the franchise, though I find it a little bit hard to call it a part of the Halloween franchise.Happy Halloween, guys, it's getting close, I'll be reviewing a lot of horror and Halloween movies a lot til the end of October, so stick right here if you liked this review! And as always thank you for reading my review.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
231,Colbridge,It's a half baked idea that lacks any real tension or horror,4,13 November 2021,"If you're expecting another Halloween movie like the original and it's sequel Halloween II (1981) you'll be in for a major disappointment. Season of the Witch has no direct correlation with the preceding movies and although produced by John Carpenter and Debra Hill, this is more science fiction than horror and has a completely different feel to it.However when you realise Carpenter had originally intended to create a different Halloween movie each year, with Michael Myers being just one of many stories, you can begin to forgive the direction this takes and enjoy it for what it is. Written by director Tommy Lee Wallace with an uncredited Nigel Kneale, author of Quatermass, it tells the story of an unscrupulous owner of a novelty toy company who sells deadly Halloween masks in order to brainwash the minds of children all over America in a modern high tech take on witchcraft.It's a half baked idea that lacks any real tension or horror so although Carpenter can be applauded for taking a risk and going in a different direction rather than retreading old ground, the audience felt otherwise and wanted to see more of Michael Myers stalking victims on Halloween night, much like they still wanted to see Jason on Friday the 13th.If you've never seen a Halloween film you may be able to appreciate this rather tame horror sci fi but if it's Michael Myers you want fast forward to Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers (1988). This film does however get referenced in the latest incarnation Halloween Kills (2021).John Carpenter lost interest in the franchise after this lacklustre entry and sold off the rights to original producer Moustapha Akkad who went on to make many more sequels without him.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
232,CaressofSteel75,Looks Good in Retrospect,7,8 March 2017,"Halloween III: Season of the Witch baffled audiences and critics alike in 1982. John Carpenter had obviously decided he'd gone as far as he could go with the Michael Meyers thing and came up with a whole new concept. In this one, Tom Atkins and the too-cute Stacey Nelkin team up to take down the sinister Silver Shamrock Corporation who are selling Halloween masks that will somehow unleash mass carnage on Halloween night. There's no Boogeyman, no butcher knife and no Jamie Lee Curtis. Most people didn't like this movie at the time, and the critics hated it. Nevertheless, it still looks pretty successful in the dollar column according to the stats here in IMDb. I didn't like this movie at first, but it looks real good now in comparison to all the bad Halloween sequels that followed over the next dozen years. It's a good slice of '80s horror that should be in your collection if you're a fan of that era.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
233,VikiLauda,"Not a ""Halloween"" sequel...But a TERRIFIC vintage horror film!",9,17 March 2021,"The sadly late producer Debra Hill really wanted the Halloween franchise to be an anthology, of all aspects of horror & not just a continuing story of Michael Myers, so instead of continuing with the slasher story, they decided to do a creepy, sci-fi/horror, with elements of witchcraft set the week before & including Halloween. & here in lies the problem people have with this movie. It bombed at the box office since it departed from the slasher Myers story & veered off an a less slasher more creepy tangent. The result (for me at least) was a superbly, sinister supernatural creep-fest, which became one of my favorite films of all time!The plot starts with a man being chased while carrying a rubber latex Halloween mask. He is persued by non descript men in suits. Eventually he is driven to hospital where he is under the care of an alcoholic Dr, but the suits men find him & murders him, yet a few days later the mans daughter finds the Dr (Tom Atkins) is a bar & she want an explanation. The two then investigate the company that makes the Halloween masks. The masks are manufactured by Silver Shamrock Novelties & its owner Conal Cochran who is no kindly Willy Wonka character, but he has a deadly obsession with paganism & clockwork toys, that are anything but!I really liked Tom Atkins in the Fog, but he is terrific in this, however the star of TSoTW is Irish actor Dan O'Herlihy who is wonderful as the sinister Cochran. The script is well done & the pacing is good. Viewing this today though the soundtrack comes across as very dated, but this is distracted by the excellent screenplay, some shocks & even a bit of gore. Saying all this though I would not recommend this movie to anyone who suffers from epilepsy as there are flashing lights scenes. But there is no sex or nudity & bad language is minimal. I would also like to add a warning about creepy crawlies. If you are really concerned with creepy crawlie critters, snakes & bugs, this movie will surely give you nightmares! You have been warned!Simply put this is a terrific vintage sci-fi/horror which can still chill the bones, just don't view this as part of the Halloween franchise & appreicate it as a stand alone horror flick. & if I am honset I think this movie out ranks ANY of the other Halloween films, by a country mile, but perhaps this is just me as, although I love horror, I am not really a slasher fan.

That's all. Anyway a old Irish man Conal Cochran owns a big Halloween mask manufacturing company but in a final process where he puts a bit of stonehenge in the mask. The bit of stonehenge causes mutations on the face. Why did they make this as a Halloween sequel? It had nothing to do with the previous 2! If they had tried to link it, it could have seen the end of Michael Myers early on in the series! They could have linked it by Michael wearing a Silver Shamrock mask. Why did they cut the UK version so much?
Though I was satisfied after watching this but then I didn't expect much. I bet everyone would have loved this film if it was called Season of the Witch. Come on it didn't deserve the treatment it got. Neither did it's theme music. Come on you have to love that Silver Shamrock tune.

236,Muldwych,"Deeply Flawed, But Fun, Creative and Worthy of Reappraisal",6,27 April 2010,"'Season Of The Witch' is the swiftly-ignored footnote in the 'Halloween' franchise - quickly forgotten evidence that 'Halloween' was meant to be more 'Creepshow' than 'Friday The 13th' in style. In retrospect, bringing back Michael Myers for 'Halloween II' was a possible mistake if the intention was for 'Halloween' to become an anthology series with a different tale in each installment. The sequel's success only cemented expectations in the viewer's minds that homicide in Haddonfield by a mask-covered psychopath was what they would see unfold each time on screen. And so by 1983, audiences clearly weren't prepared for 'Season Of The Witch' and made this fact abundantly clear at the box office, which is a great shame, because deeply-flawed as it is, 'Halloween III' is a lot of fun and does not deserve to be overlooked the way it often is.The storyline, centred around a toy factory manufacturing murderous masks designed to bring nationwide doom at 9pm on October 31st, is built up very intriguingly. We have a 'Simon Van Gelder'-like madman trying to warn the world of the impending slaughter, chillingly-ruthless killers in business suits silencing anyone who tries to get the word out, and strikingly memorable death scenes - one of which might be described as 'facial origami', and that's only the first 15 minutes. Soon, our story's heroes are embroiled in the factory's strange machinations, where nothing and no-one is exactly what they seem. The script builds up a tense atmosphere, leading to a truly compelling end that will keep viewers guessing long after.Yet 'Season Of The Witch' (a title not to be taken too literally) comes across as an intriguing second draft - full of good ideas, but lacking the kind of logic and key exposition that would have really brought the audience on board. Writer Tommy Lee Wallace's America, for example, seems to occupy one single time zone, in which it's possible to have the nation's children watching their televisions at the appointed hour. Likewise, we are expected to believe that the illegal appropriation of one of the world's largest and heaviest artificial landmarks - a key plot point at the climax - seems to be no more difficult than stealing a mattress from a bedding store and spiriting it away on a car's roof. Dr Challis, the lead character, is an obvious graduate of 'Action Hero Medical College', stitching up wounds one day and tackling the undead like Indiana Jones the next. The film's other two leads are also something of a puzzle, with their identities and ultimate fate never being satisfactorily explored. All of which leaves 'Halloween III' as a series of entertaining sequences that anyone attempting the most basic of critical analysis will be punished instantly with crushing bafflement. The lack of audience enthusiasm cannot be solely attributed to the absence of Michael Myers (who ironically, does enjoy a few seconds of screen time).Nonetheless, it would have been interesting if 'Halloween' had become an anthology series of horror, and with 'Halloween III' not short on ideas, it's only a shame more care and attention wasn't put into the effort. All involved clearly failed to understand what they had set in motion with the first two outings, unable to see that any change in direction for the franchise would have to be very well-executed to win the fans over. However, it wasn't and Michael Myers would go on to make a respectable return five years later. For what it offers, I think 'Season Of The Witch' is definitely worth a look - arguably more creative than most of the 'Halloween' sequels, but seriously lacking polish.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
237,acdc_mp3,This is the best of the Halloween movies. Fight me.,10,18 January 2021,"I remember seeing the first Halloween and being very disappointed with it because I was probably the only person in the world who read the book before the movie came out. I loved the book, it had a great story to as why Michael Myers existed and was very violent. So, I skipped Halloween II because I didn't want to be disappointed again. I purely went to go see Halloween III with a bunch of a friends because we were drinking beer like prohibition was going to start again the next day, so why not see it?The movie begins with a close up of a computer screen with eerie music playing as something is being drawn, but you have no idea what it is. I found this a pretty cool way to do the opening credits of the movie and we see it is a pumpkin that begins flashing. I was already intrigued at this point because this turned out to be anything BUT about Michael Myers. What makes this movie great to me is the fact that it's not going to be horny teenagers that do stupid things getting killed, its millions of innocent children that are targeted to be murdered in a horrific way. That's a truly disturbing thought.The body count in this movie is relatively low, but the deaths that do occur are happily ghoulish. There is one death that really freaked me out when I first saw it in 1982, and it still does now in 2021. (I literally just watched the movie for probably the 10th again today). Its when the ""Test Family"" get exposed to the commercial that will be broadcast to millions of children on Halloween night. The boy puts on his mask, the creepy music starts, the flashing Jack O' Lantern comes on, and the poor kid falls to the floor, his head collapsing upon itself, his dead blank eye peeking through the mask as creepy creatures such as snakes and bugs, come out of the dead maw of his mouth. His parents watch him die then they die themselves as the evil Conal Cochran watches with delight. Usually movies show pity to the kids, but not this one! That kid was jacked up and died horribly!As with any movie of this ilk, there are some convenient set ups that help the movie along. This movie shows probably the least busy hospital on the entire planet, the drunken doctor happens to get to score with deliciously sexy daughter of the first victim. (She was obviously adopted, because the first victim was well.......not a handsome lad). I am not sure why all the robots looked like insurance salesmen that wore very noisy shoes.Anyway, I am sort of rambling, but I did find this movie very entertaining and I will always watch it if I am channel surfing . If you are expecting a Jamie Lee Curtis kind of Halloween you will be disappointed. Myself, I thought it was a welcome change to slasher style movies that were being churned out at the time.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
238,culmo80,Decent,5,4 March 2013,"I think this movie unfairly receives bad reviews due to it not having any connection to Michael Myers what-so-ever. If they had somehow worked in that Michael Myers was a part of this Celtic cult, then they may have been able to sell it better. But the original premise of doing a completely different ""Halloween"" movie ended with Halloween II. After that, it became a franchise and Halloween III just had the bad luck of trying to break that.Anyway, I enjoyed the premise of the movie. The acting is decent, and the special effects are actually not that bad for a movie of this time period. I think with a little more plot work, this could have been a good movie.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

As far as this movie - Michael Myers is a famous boogeyman from a Halloween movie.No, Halloween III was supposed to be a new entry in the franchise that was about to become an anthology of different halloween themed movies every year. But we all now know how that turned out.And goddammit, first 15 to 30 minutes of this movie go really strong. The mood, the atmosphere, the mystery. But, unfortunatly, after that great start... well it still goes strong but becomes also very, very silly.Suddenly we have robots, lasers, magic lasers, Stonehenge, magic masks that shoot magic lasers that can turn you head into mush filled with bugs and snakes. Did I mention mother effin Stonehenge? And a honest to god - a Bond villain to tie all that up somehow.So you see, even if it got bad really quick, this movie got bad in all the right ways. So yeah, no Myers for now, but damn it's a fun ride with a bitchin' music score by Carpenter and Howarth.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

People will watch the film Halloween and think Michael Myers was class, then they will watch this and be like what the hell was that. It is an embarrassment to be in the Halloween saga. Remember this in my opinion so don't get annoyed if you like this film but I just think it should be called SEASON OF THE WITCH because it doesn't deserve to have the Halloween title before it. It is in no way a sequel the only time you see Myers in it is when Cochran ties Challis to the chair and turns on the TV and when Challis is sitting in the bar and the trailer comes on.

245,TheMichaelMyersMovieFanatic,"""80s B-Movie Horror at its best!""",8,4 September 2020,"Halloween III: Season of the Witch fits better in the ""Love or Hate"" category than almost any other horror movie ever made. So to start this review off, I'm going to talk a little about the history of this movie. When Halloween II was released the plan was to make the Halloween Franchise into an anthology series, and the first movie to be a part of this project was Halloween III. Now as many of you know, this movie got a lot of hate when it was released mainly because of the fact that it was a Halloween movie without Michael Myers. Now the easiest solution to this problem would simply be to call the movie ""Season of the Witch"" instead of ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"", but as stated in the audio commentary with writer/director Tommy Lee Wallace, the movie would never have gotten made without Halloween III in the title. Over the years people have begun to really appreciate this movie for what it is, and thank god for that!Halloween III really is a 80s Horror B-Movie at its best. The story is insane, yet amazing. The score is one of John Carpenter's best ones in my opinion. The acting is great (especially Tom Atkins and Dan O'Herlihy). There's even a lot of suspense and tension throughout the movie. And boy oh boy, if these kills aren't brutal, then I don't know what is!Other than that, I really think Halloween III has some great atmosphere. A great example of this is the town that Stacey Nelkin and Tom Atkins characters visit. The movie just does a great job at setting up this town where something is always off. I won't go into spoilers, but you'll know what I'm talking about if you have seen the movie.If there's anything I could mark as a negative, it's the ending. And not because of the tone of the ending or anything like that, it's just because it starts making less and less sense the more you think about it. Trust me when I say that I enjoy dark endings, it just doesn't make much sense. Then again, this is a B-Movie so it isn't really as big of an issue.I love Halloween III, and I'm glad that it has gained a cult following. It's probably my favorite Halloween movie besides the original even though I really like some of the other movies.Horror: B+ (Some Scary/Intense Scenes. Quite Brutal Kills)Entertainment: A (It's One of the More Entertaining Halloween Movies)Acting: A- (Tom Atkins and Dan O'Herlihy are the Standouts)Suspense: A- (A lot of Tension Throughout. The Test Room A Scene is Intense)Characters: B+ (They are Likeable. Conal Cochran is a Great Villain)Script/Story: A- (Absolutely Insane)Overall Rating: 8.4/10.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
246,jonpd,Worthwhile,10,11 October 2002,"Many viewers have bashed on this film, claiming it stinks and that it has nothing in common with the other HALLOWEEN films. Well, let me tell you, if you're a true Carpenter idolizer you'll see him written all over this. Writer/director Tommy Lee Wallace didn't necessarily write the best script in the world, but his direction is decent. The performances are kind of stale, but they still come through. On the more positive side, Carpenter's electronic score is one of his greatest in my book. From the eerie opening to the chase sequence, the music fits the movie perfectly. Granted, the film has nothing to do with Michael Myers and Haddonfield, etc., but it is the same season, and Myers was supposedly BURNT TO A CRISP WITH HIS EYES SHOT OUT!!!!!! in the end of HALLOWEEN II. HALLOWEEN III is definitely worth viewing.

I even wondered myself if my opinion would change after seeing it, do I will love it more or dislike. Like I said, I liked it on first viewing, but after seeing it twice.. it's very ok. Why I liked it less? Because there are a couple with absolutely no chemistry, and yet, he was going to save her until the end. Not much interesting at all. The plot is pretty strange and I felt something unpleasant watching it. Some of the shots are awesome, but the cinematography is kind of bland looking. The masks are pretty cool though. It has a few good scenes, good special effects, good ending, but the film is not really good at all. I had no problem with this film is not featuring Michael Myers, but they shouldn't put the title 'Halloween III' which for obvious reason it got lots of hate, even when if it was called 'Season of the Witch', my opinion still wouldn't change. I can say that I'm actually surprised some people said it's the best movie of the franchise or even saying it's great. I've wanted to like it more, but it's not good at all. Not terrible either.

It's just as bad as you think. I didn't even watch the whole thing. I didn't have to. I knew the end was going to be stupid.

252,pleiades10,Give this one another shot.,5,23 October 2000,"Okay... so it's widely known that this is the ONE Halloween film without Michael Myers, and without Dr. Loomis. It abandons the slasher film genre for a strange story dealing with witchcraft, a toy manufacturer, nearly indestructible henchmen, and one bizarre Halloween TV special. But Halloween 3 has quite a bit going for it as well. The scene wherein the ""test family"" enters the room with the young boy wearing a halloween mask still chills me. The spastic ""happy happy halloween"" music, the echoing laughter of the boy's mother, and the moment that the boy grips his head even as it begins to melt and mutate into various vermin are the things nightmares are made of. Likewise is the quick scene where an older woman starts picking at a mask she buys for her grandson with a bobby pin. The image of what that mask did to her face is still emblazoned in my mind. Sure, the plot has some loopholes, and the acting isn't exactly stellar, but it still manages to spook me in some fashion whenever I watch it.

The chip installed into every mask causes a reaction with the screenings to infest the child's head in a gruesome way.Two people try to save Halloween by stopping the bad men and killing the head alien.

256,RyanEberhart,Not one of my favorites...,6,6 November 2013,"Well, what can I say about Halloween III: Season of the Witch?It's very hard to find something positive to say about Halloween III. I can say that Dan O'Herlihy and Tom Atkins both did a pretty good job of delivering their lines. Some of the other acting was OK. However, with the script not including Michael Myers this was a poor movie over all. I guess that the writers tried to explain why Michael Myers was hell bent on killing his family.When I bought this movie I only bought it because it ""belongs"" in the series. I'll try to come up with something or some scene I can say that is positive, but there isn't much I can say. I've only watched Halloween III about a half dozen times, including while writing this review. IMDb.com only has 4.2 Stars out of 10 as a rating, I have to say that I only gave this a 5. If I can't find anything positive to write about this movie I am sure I won't have to apologize too much or be asked to.It would be easier to list the things wrong with this movie. For instance, no Micheal Myers. The damn commercial that hypnotizes the children into killing their parents and then kills the children. The robots that do the dirty work such as killing. Really?! Robots?!The tour of the Silver Shamrock factory was pretty cool. I liked that they showed how the masks were made, from pouring the latex to the painting. Wow, if I am talking about a tour of a factory from a movie then there really isn't much hope for the whole movie. I think I might have to rethink what rating I am giving this movie, it's pretty hokey. However, unless the story is pretty bad, the acting is horrible and many other aspects of the movie are substandard then the rating will stay where it is. OK, I might raise it to a 6, but not any higher. I think not having Michael Myers in this movie detracted from it significantly.

Even my son said it should not have carried the Halloween title as part of the series.We enjoyed the off-beat story. The masks, the Silver Shamrock jingle, the factory, the ""robots,"" the characters. The music was chilling.There was only one part I disliked.

266,Sharkey360,An under-rated and misunderstood horror film!,8,16 October 2013,"When the term Halloween is mentioned regarding movies, the name and image of killer Michael Myers often come out. In the art of film, director John Carpenter defined the slasher horror sub-genre of horror films in 1978's Halloween. In that film, his use of the first-person camera views, establishing the final girl trend, showing that people who are promiscuous or drug users get killed and other elements went on to become imitated by other filmmakers on the many slasher horror films that followed. It also established Michael Myers (called The Shape) as the stealthy, almost invincible killer that later became an American pop culture icon.Of course, the $325,000 movie went on to make tons of money and Halloween II followed a few years later and made nice profit even though it never matched its predecessor's success.Then in 1982, Halloween III: Season of the Witch came out. Originally, the Halloween film franchise was geared towards making distinct, independent stories with completely new characters dealing with the Halloween season in general. Halloween III proved to be profitable but got slammed by critics and several viewers hated it simply because it was too different and had no Michael Myers (who was shown destroyed in Halloween II).If you ask me, Halloween III: Season of the Witch is actually an under- rated and misunderstood horror film. It is no slasher. It has no Michael Myers. It has no zombie or vampire elements of horror. But those differences don't make it a bad movie at all.In fact, Halloween III was more about the witchcraft aspect of Halloween's origins outside of America as well as social commentary about capitalism and consumerism. These three primary elements are, least to say, very challenging to build a foundation of horror with. Still, the filmmakers pulled off nicely with that challenge and what turned was that Halloween III has a more original concept of horror than most other horror films made ever since. It never feels generic and continues to be creepy.Without spoiling too much of the plot, Halloween III begins with a desperate man running away from mysterious men in suits and ties. He eventually gets killed at night at a hospital and his killer weirdly left the place, entered a parked car, poured gasoline around, lit the gasoline and blew the car up.Of course, the person who witnesses the explosion and events at the hospital is Dr. Challis (Tom Atkins) who is not only the protagonist but also a challenging one for viewers to follow. Why is that? Because Dr. Challis is an undesirable man for a horror film protagonist – when he is not working, he drinks a lot of liquor, spends time at bars, does not care much about his family and is a womanizer. Ironically, this aspect of the film makes Halloween III even more unique from other horror films.So Dr. Challis meets Ellie (Stacey Nelkin), the daughter of the murder victim. She strongly believes something is very wrong and something big was behind the murder of her father. Together they travel to a far away town where a big company making Halloween masks is being led by an Irish businessman named Conal Cochran (Dan O'Herlihy).Enough of the story. You will just have to watch the film on DVD or Blu- ray for the Halloween season or whenever you feel like watching a horror movie different from the rest. Even during its time, Halloween III had a low budget although the production value on screen don't necessarily reflect that. Considering the challenges the filmmakers had to endure, Halloween III works as a horror flick as it provides scary and creepy moments nicely and also expresses the message that there is something behind all the commercialism of Halloween. In any business dealing with seasonal trends, there is always something that keeps people spending their money on products they don't really need and there is always a company that tends to profit from it.Is Halloween III an anti-business movie? In some ways, yes. Just look at the isolated town where the business and its factory are located. If you listen to the dialog closely, you will realize that locals of the town are being put down by the company (Silver Shamrock) which employs people coming from elsewhere. Also there is that reflection of corporate-led control on the town with those many surveillance cameras and an imposed curfew (who would want to live in a community so restrictive and without public officials to stand up for the people?) and more. Naturally, Conal Cochran is the main villain radically different from not only Michael Myers but all other horror film villains. Dan O'Herlihy's performance is undeniably solid.Another notable aspect of Halloween III that deserves attention was its defiance of the unwritten rule of movies and television that prohibit the showing of children getting killed on-screen. The filmmakers really had the courage and insight to break that rule to show what kind of evil would happen when kids wear Cochran's masks (each equipped with material from a stolen Stonehenge) and watch the Silver Shamrock commercial (with that very repetitive, mind-numbing song). The bad things that turnout are enough to shock viewers and even send chills up the spines of parents who are afraid of their children engaging in Halloween. Overall, Halloween III: Season of the Witch is one of the most under- rated and most misunderstood horror films that truly deserves your attention in this day and age. It defied many of the clichés or traditions of most horror films and yet succeeded in delivering spooky moments in unpredictable fashion. It is also challenging to watch given its undesirable protagonist and having no final girl to outlast the evil. To call the film a failure because it did not have Michael Myers is a big mistake. Be sure to watch this film every Halloween.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
267,Celluloid_Fiend,"Witches And Warlocks And Costumes, Oh My!",5,19 March 2019,"This film is given lots of bad press, as the worst sequel of this franchise, mostly because it doesn't connect itself to the saga of Michael Myers. But while that might be an unfair bias against the film, it is hardly without many flaws of it's own, that hinder it from being a great scary film.The biggest problem within the film, is lack of giving proper amounts of information to make something convincing. When the doctor (played solidly by Tom Atkins) shows signs that he has feelings for Ellie (played by Stacey Nelkin) and sleeps with her, it seems to come out of nowhere. There is no build up to it, nothing to indicate that they would feel that way for each other, as they've only just met over the course of a day. Later, when the doctor frees Ellie from captivity and they race to stop the broadcasts, Ellie is revealed to be one of the robots of the evil Silver Shamrock company. But how long has that been the case? Was she one all along? Why didn't she deactivate, when they blew up the factory, like the other ones did? There are just so many things like this, that it takes you out of the moment and you lose a lot of the tension the film should be generating.That isn't to say the film has nothing good about it. The performances by Tom Atkins and Dan O'Herlihy (as the villain of the piece) are very engaging, especially when they are on-screen together. O'Herlihy brilliantly captures that sense of quiet evil with his performance, as he's all smiles and charm one minute, then the heart of darkness the next. Atkins is great as the reluctant hero, who is clearly in over his head. Also, the musical score is top notch (not surprising, as it comes from John Carpenter). It is very eerie and constantly give you the feeling of dread. Even the jingle to the Silver Shamrock television ad can give you the spooks.Still, despite all that, the film ultimately suffers from some very poor script writing and lack of proper explanations. It takes what could have been one of the all-time classic scare films and turns it into a mediocre effort, that should have been thought-out more.This isn't really a bad movie, but the flaws within it keep it from being truly good. I applaud the makers for trying something different. And while the film should not be snubbed for that, it has plenty of it's own issues that lessen the appeal of it. As loathe as I am of remakes, I actually think this film could benefit from such, provided the script writing was up to par. As it stands, the film is merely watchable. Perhaps something to watch late at night, when you can't sleep. Sadly, it could have been so much more.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
268,jpasols,"A Different Halloween movie, NO Michael Myers!",5,11 May 2019,"Let me begin by saying, this movie isnt bad because theres no Michael Myers, it's not that good either because the acting was seriously terrible! As well as the special effects! I've seen better special effects in horror movies from the 60s and 70s rather than this movie! The plot of this movie really isnt that great either, interesting yes, but the movie fails at delivering that interesting concept, this movie is boring! Let's just say that. Halloween 3 is a boring movie, not scary, not fun, not entertaining. Even the death scenes were pretty weak, the CGI was awful, and the movie felt very rushed at the end. However some positive things about this movie, even though there is no Michael Myers and there has nothing to do with Michael Myers and his story in this film, there ARE some cameos and some minor easter eggs to the original two films. There is a scene in this movie where Daniel Challis is watching TV at a bar and the trailer for the original Halloween came on. Then near the end of the movie, Challis is tied to a chair while the demented toy maker talks to Challis about his sinister plan to kill all the kids wearing his masks with a secret device implanted within the masks that goes off and melts your face with bugs and snakes when you watch the commercial on TV. Anyway, So the evil toy maker has Challis tied to a chair and on the TV in front of him he is actually watching the original Halloween movie with Jamie Lee Curtis on screen. So theres two easter eggs to the original film. A cameo is made by some of the actors of the original Halloween such as Annie, played by Nancy Kyes, who first appeared in Halloween 1978. She was in this movie for a small part playing the mother of Challis' kids. Even Jamie Lee Curtis had a very very VERY small part in this movie but shes uncredited so you wont find her on the credits list for this movie. But Curtis actually played an emergency phone operator in this movie!. So those small Halloween 1 and 2 connections were pretty awesome for this movie that has NOTHING to do with Michael Myers.Now for those of you who are confused about why Michael Myers isnt in this movie is because after making Halloween 2, John Carpenter (director of Halloween 1978 and composer of Halloween II) decided to stop the Michael Myers story and continue this franchise as a horror anthology series, the idea being that Halloween 1 and 2 be about Michael Myers, Halloween 3 being a different plot, Halloween 4 being a different plot, and so on. So that was the original intention for this franchise but people didn't like that idea and this movie got its ass kicked by horror and Michael Myers fans back in the day. So they gave the fans what they wanted and brought Michael Myers back for Halloween 4. And that's the story on why Halloween 3 has NO Michael Myers. Just for those who didn't know the reasoning.Anyway that all pretty much concludes my review for Halloween 3: Season of the Witch.My final rating for Halloween 3: 5 out of 10",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
269,jeffman52001,An underrated horror movie.,10,31 October 2005,"""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" is a great horror movie, though Michael Myers wasn't in the movie, I think it is a cool movie. Tommy Lee Wallace did a great job directing it. He did the voice in the ""Silver Shamrock"" commercials.The cast is really awesome, Tom Atkins as Dr. Dan Challis, Dan O'Herlihy as Conal Cochran, Stacy Nelkin as Ellie Grimbridge, Michael Currie as Raferty, and the late Ralph Strait as Buddy Kupfer make up the great cast.It is getting near Halloween, a man who is running some people are after him,he gets to the gas station. The gas station attendant takes the man to the hospital. Dr. Dan Challis cares for the man,the man is holding onto a Halloween mask and is scared.Later on, a guy in a suit enters the hospital and goes to the man's room and kills him by pulling his skull apart.Dr. Challis chases after the killers, then the killer goes to his car and pours gasoline on himself and sets himself on fire, then the car explodes.The next morning,the police are there to investigate and Dr. Challis meets Ellie, the daughter of the man who was murdered. They meet later on in a bar and try to figure out what happened. They do find out where Ellie's father was at before he died, a small town called Santa Mira. They discover that is where the ""Silver Shamrock"" factory is, the place where they make the Halloween masks. They go to a hotel and meet some people who are going to the ""Silver Shamrock"" factory.Dr. Challis and Ellie make some discoveries and meet Conal Cochran, the man who owns the ""Silver Shamrock"" factory. He is a warlock who is planning the death of the children though the masks which have a chip in the trademark.By watching the commercial of ""Silver Shamrock"" will active the chip when the ""Magic Pumpkin"" appears.The ending will keep you guessing if Dr. Challis succeeded in saving the kids.This movie really had me on my feet, I love this movie cause of the drama and horror.If you notice in the movie, the actress who played Dr. Challis's ex-wife, played in the first ""Halloween"" movie as Annie Brackett and the actor who played Dr. Dan Challis's son, Joshua Miller, who is the son of the late actor Jason Miller of ""The Exorcist"".I give this movie 2 thumbs up and 10 stars.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
270,horrormb,"Okay, I voted a little high for this...",2,7 February 1999,"I gave this a 2, but only because it was a good effort to make the Halloween franchise into a possible ""Tales from the Crypt"" type of thing.  I can't forgive them for tossing Mike Myers out the window but they brought him back.  The whole concept was too ludicrous for anything really but the ending was pretty cool.  The rest of the movie made me yearn to go back to something like Splatter University...

271,jordansepticeye,Didn't Need Michael To Be Good,9,15 October 2016,"This movie is great,and I'm kind of disappointed that the Halloween franchise didn't end up as an anthology series like it was supposed to be,but I'm fine with more Michael Myers.First,the good,the story,it is very creepy,disturbing,and very creative.The lead character,he is well acted and not completely likable,another new thing in this movie.The deaths,well not as good as in the last films,they are gory and unique.The villain,he is intimidating and calm at the same time,and very well acted.The tone also sticks close to the previous movies.I also liked the ending and the soundtrack is great.Now the bad,I feel as if some characters should have been more developed,and it doesn't really know what kind of movie it wants to be.Halloween III is a great,well made entry in the Halloween franchise.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

It is a little cheesy and doesn't really hold up well, but I think its a fun time. Some scenes are unintentionally funny, and the story is extremely dark, but its a fun Friday night movie. The soundtrack is awesome though. I think that's the best part of the movie. Chariot Of Pumpkins is a great track.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
274,zurnd,Zurn Cult Classics: Halloween 3: Season of the Witch,7,25 October 2013,"Well, the mystic, spooky and spectacular Halloween season is at large once more and I thought it would be fitting to do some Halloween themed movie reviews to fit the occasion. What haunted, horrifying thriller of doom have I decided to review? What film full of thrills, chills and spills shall I share my perspective on. Well, how about the vastly underrated third entry in the Halloween series. This film is Michael Myers free this time around and although the William Shatner masked murderer is absent, this film strays in it's own direction and comes off as something entirely new, original and above all, entertaining. Originally, John Carpenter (director of the first Halloween) and crew were going to make the Halloween series an anthology series, similar to Twilight Zone and the Outer Limits before it. Had the film succeeded, the next film would have been a supernatural thriller about ghosts. But people were angry that Michael Myers was absent, and the anthology idea was flushed down the crapper as the series returned to it's roots for Halloween 4. But as the series brought back Michael Myers for a string of slasher sequels, remakes reinterpretations, requels, seboots, whatever, Halloween 3 remains the most distinguishing of the horror series, the black sheep or Looney Tunes character at Disneyland. But does that mean it's bad? Not in my book. Don't get me wrong, the film's not perfect (nothing is). There are some elements that don't add up and there are a lot of loose ends not tied up by the film's conclusion. But the bottom line is that this is a pure, solid Halloween flick. I don't mean Halloween as in the Halloween series, but as an all around Halloween chiller, perfect for the haunted holiday season. I watch this film every year, embracing the dark, the twisted, the ghastly and the all around cheesiness this film has to offer. In recent years, I've come to realize how unlike any horror film Halloween 3 is. This is a creative movie filled with grand 80s effects, twisted imagery, grotesque and fowl scenes of murder and killer masks! It doesn't get any more original than that! And the Silver Shamrock commercial....need I say more. It just would't seem like Halloween to me without listening to that ridiculously catchy song and seeing Don Post's stellar pumpkin, witch and skull masks looming on the television screen. Don Post is also known for molding the famous Tor Johnson mask and the Captain Kirk mask that was used for Michael Myers in the first Halloween film. Is Halloween 3 my favorite of the series? Probably not, if I had to be perfectly honest. Halloween and Halloween 2 (which I will always consider to be one movie because they take place on the same night) will always be the standout pieces of the collection, with the Thorn Trilogy and the Laurie Strode saga coming in very close. But Halloween 3 will always be a special experience for me, a horror film unlike anything I've ever seen on All Hallows Eve. Sure it has it's share of problems, but it's still entertaining, terrifying and full of that Halloween goodness I long for every October. If the film were not called Halloween 3, I think people would enjoy it more. It's the standout piece in an all around horrifying film series.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
275,Arlis,Quit being stupid and watch this without Michael Myers on your mind.,6,24 November 2006,"This movie is a decent movie. Its Not great but it is different and as original of an idea as you can get. I watched it as a kid and yes I thought it was odd it didn't have Myers, but not everything to do with Halloween has to do with him. I thought perhaps it was a movie having nothing to do with the others and didn't pay any attention to directors and sequels etc when I was young and first started watching films.Season Of The Witch is a very unique movie about a strange old man who for some reason wants to kill little children by using their masks. My only argument was that there were three masks to choose from and I am sure that, unlike tickle me elmo, not all the kids would want one. Who wants to look like everyone else.This movie always entertained me as a kid and I will always continue to watch it when I watch the Halloween series. It is a nice break between the Michael Myers films which all look the same if you watch them back to back.Tommy Lee Wallace did an amazing job writing and directing it and I am a fan of his work. I mean he wrote Amityville: The possession which is one of the scariest movies ever made.This Halloween was suppose to be a new direction. Myers was dead and Carpenter wanted to release a new movie every year with a new Halloween theme, but all these stupid people started whining ""wheres Michael Myers where is Dr. Loomis Wheres Jamie Lee"" and they never gave this movie a chance - it shows that people who did that aren't very intelligent cause this was a pretty good movie - so I urge people to get their head out of their ass and watch this movie as Season Of The Witch and forget Myers for five minutes and with all the sequels and all the crappy remakes and Hollywood garbage being fed to us these days you should appreciate something original like this!!!",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

277,Don_Falone1985,Extremely underrated,8,2 November 2021,"I have to say, this film suffers from having a bad reputation, simply because it is completely different to the usual Halloween franchise. It doesn't have Michael Myers in it and apart from the characters watching Halloween on the TV, it doesn't really have any relevance to the Halloween films, so it's a bit strange that it's called ""Halloween 3"", as I personally feel as a stand alone film, it wouldn't have the negative reaction it received. I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and it was actually pretty disturbing In parts. It follows a corporation that makes Halloween kids masks, but have a sinister plan and reason behind it. They plan to sacrifice the children that Don these masks in an ancient ritual, so the motives behind this act are from an old age cult like ritual being implemented by the main antagonist. An excellent stand alone horror film in my views if you can ignore the fact it's called Halloween 3.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
278,Vassago,A good and underrated horror.,10,6 December 1999,"It still amazes me to find out how many viewers hate this stylish and atmospheric horror. I know that people who dislike this movie feel that way *only* because it is a sequel to Halloween 1 and 2. These people should spend five minutes reading an anniversary interview with Tommy Lee Wallace, from which they could learn that H3 was not planned as a sequel but only as the beginning of an extension of the series - a ""voyage"" into themes different from The Shape's line. It was never planned to be titled ""Halloween III"", actually - only at the last moment did the studio owners decide to do it, against Tommy Lee's will and to his annoyance. This film should simply be treated as a standalone project, only connected with the series by the fact that it takes place at the time of Halloween. Only then will you be able to see that it's in fact a good, very 80s, horror movie, with an excellent, ambient soundtrack - in fact, this film has the best synthesizer soundtrack ever created. As for the famed ""annoying"" song, it's not annoying in the least, and in fact it gets spooky in the end.

It was very successful and made its director very famous. Everybody liked this film. But already by its second sequel the film-makers had the glorious idea of making a movie with the same name but a completely different story instead of sticking to a good series. And so the perfect example of how NOT to make a sequel was born.Okay, I'm trying to stop being ironical now.There is really not much to like about this film. The acting was so poor that I was actually very happy to see some of the actors getting killed. The story is simply ridiculous (A micro chip in a Halloween mask that turns your head into spiders and snakes when a certain music is played? Robots decapitating people? Come on, you can do better than that!). And there's this annoying music (Eight more days to Halloween...; you know which one I mean) all over the film. It is obvious the film-makers used the name of a very famous film to get at least a few people to watch this poor excuse of a horror film.Definitely not a highlight in any of the crew or cast member's career.My rating: 3/10 (Don't let this film discourage you, #4 is excellent!)",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

The first half hour felt like half a day, and then it got worse. Just to be clear, after reading other comments: I don't care if Michael Myers is in the movie or not. Neither do I care whether this movie's name is ""Halloween"" or not. It sucks rocks whatever you want to call it.

This movie isn't even a side story it is just a stupid and very senseless movie that thought it would catch popularity because it was called Halloween III: season of the witch.

286,okami_ito,Better then you might think.,8,16 June 2006,"First of all i have to say, that i'm a big Nigel Kneale Fan. I think he's the king of creepiness. The Quatermass-Movies he wrote are really terrifying (especially the one with the pit!) and his television-work is remarkable, too. In Halloween III Kneales (uncredited) influence is obvious: witchcraft, nihilism, modern technology and a general nastiness that is seldom in U.S. American horror- movies. The most people, who don't like this movie are upset, because Michael Myers isn't in it. Regrettably a large number of the general audience wants to see the same movie again and again. That's why so much unoriginal movies are made. So Halloween III without Michael Myers? So what? The second part had him and it was boring from the beginning. Since then, nothing much has changed in Myer-land. One franchise worse than the other. In my eyes the 3rd part is the best of the sequels, because it has something the others haven't: a creepy premise and some truly shocking moments. ( Or do you think snakes and insects crawling out of the head of a little boy in front of his parents isn't shocking? Think again.) I won't even go into the political aspects of this movie considering mass media, because i'm a horror-fan and only interested if a movie works. This one does. Of course there are the obvious mistakes of a cheap movie: strange coincidences, illogical plot twists etc. But you know what? I give a s*** about logic, if the general tone of a story is build up consequently it's all right with me. Wallace does a great job in establishing an evil thread and he doesn't give away the goods to soon. The character of the evil wizard who wants to kill thousands of children (and their parents) just for the fun of it, comes from the mind of a genius (Nigel Kneale, i guess). The idea of involving artifacts from Stonehenge in a big mad scientists laboratory is great, too. And the main character? Come on! A guy who goes on a dangerous investigating trip with an unknown girl and grabs a six-pack of beer before leaving, can't be that unsympathetic! By the way Atkins does a great job here, considering that his role sometimes tends to the ridiculous.

He wanted make it an anthology series with each movie telling a different Halloween themed story.However, movie-goers at the time went to see the movie expecting to see a continuation of the Myers storyline and instead got a movie about an evil toy corporation, Silver Shamrock that wants to kill the children across the United States on Halloween night, using a combination of Halloween masks and a clever, but irritating TV campaign to lure them in.One night, local store owner, Harry Grimbridge is brought to the hospital while Dr. Challis is on duty, clutching a Silver Shamrock mask and is subsequently brutally murdered under his care. The culprit bizarrely commits suicide outside the hospital afterwards, adding to the mystery.After identifying his body, Harry's daughter Ellie Grimbridge decides to investigate and traces his steps back to Santa Mira, a creepy town where the masks are manufactured.There, she and Challis pretend to be a married couple (the age difference between Ellie and Challis is really distracting) and attempt to unravel the horrifying truth behind Silver Shamrock. Once they discover that the masks will literally disintegrate children's heads as they watch the specially designed TV commercials on Halloween night, it's a race against time to defeat the toymaker behind Silver Shamrock and stop the broadcast from going out.Like Freddy's Revenge of the Nightmare on Elm Street movies, Season of the Witch is the black sheep of it's respective series.Also, like the aforementioned movie, Season of the Witch is best viewed as a standalone horror movie separate from the series it represents. It's still not that great of a movie, but it has some interesting and creative ideas that were overlooked by the movie-going public at the time who were too distracted by the lack of Michael Myers.One thing the movie did get right, however, is the music. Season of the Witch retains the Halloween theme from the previous movies and mixes it with the music from The Fog (another Carpenter movie) creating a genuinely creepy and uneasy atmosphere.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
293,marcfantozzi,Give it a break!,8,21 July 2001,"I'm tired of this film being slammed by critics and fans alike simply because there is no Shape. There is a lot of mystery in Halloween 3. Why was Ellie's father killed? What goes on in Cochran's factory? And what's the deal with that freaky town Santa Mira? I found this film entertaining and thought that the acting was decent. This would be a cult classic if it was not part of the series. Sure, this film is not as good as the Michael Myers' films, but if this is the worst Halloween film, then the Halloween series is doing something right!",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

295,deheor,"no Michael Myers, get over it",7,26 March 2006,"After a sequel that ended the Michael Myers saga (or at least ended it until someone decided there was more money to be made) the producers were in a position of trying to decide where to go next. They made one of the most bold, and reviled decisions. They decided to give the audience something new.Halloween 3:Season of the witch tells the story of a doctor who tries to understand what led to a murder in the hospital he worked at. He meets up with the victims daughter and they realize that the last appointment he had before he showed up in emergency was at a out of the way mask factory. When they head to the small town they find security cameras everywhere and no police force at all. Along the way they meet up with ace mask salesman Buddy Kupfer and his equally annoying family, Marge Gutman (that name should never had made it past the first draft), and company president (and legendary prankster) Conal Cochran. Although the company has a record of the order being picked up they happily provide a replacement and try to send our heroes packing but they manage to piggyback a tour on the backs of Kupfer family and during it, they spot her Father's car hidden poorly in one of the loading bays. When they attempt to bring some police in from the outside the company captures them and in James Bond villain style, explain their plans in great detail.This movie drew a lot of criticism for several reason most of which were undeserved. Some seemed to find it confusing and they did not understand the motives of the villains but if they paid attention it is all explained quite clearly. The goal is two fold, return Halloween to its dark roots and to sacrifice millions.Another complaint was the commercial jingle that plays dozens of times over the course of the film that seemed to annoy many but in all fairness, name a jingle that doesn't get under your skin. They are designed to seer into the brain and the Silver Shamrock commercial does just that.Perhaps the most frustrating complaint are by people who are upset about the lack of Michael Myers. I think that book had been closed quite well in the second film and Carpenter's idea of continuing the series as unique stories that are related to the holiday Halloween instead of simply doing retreads of the first picture (an idea that was picked up by the most recent Hellraiser sequels as Pinhead and company have been pushed further into the background in favour of new stories of the damned) was great and more series's would benefit from such an approach.Despite the negative view many people have this is simply the best sequel to Halloween of them all. Tom Atkins and Stacy Nelkin make a very enjoyable (though unlikely) screen couple, and Dan O'Herlihy makes a terrific villain. His explanation for how the Stonehenge rock arrived is a real laugh out loud moment. Sure the film sometimes looks a little cheap. The control room set up is really low tech, even for an eighties film but the special effects are so well done that all is forgiven.I highly recommend this to anyone who is in the mood for something different.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
296,Scream-11,Don't condemn the movie on one flaw!,8,13 December 1998,"Okay, so it had the wrong title.  This definitely shouldn't have been in the same series as Halloween and Halloween 2, but it was a good movie if you don't try to compare it to the previous ones.  I happen to like the theme song (annoying, yes, but kinda catchy), and I thought the movie had a couple of genuine scares.  It wasn't a great film, but it doesn't deserve to be trashed for not having Michael Myers.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
297,Juniore,Not there at all,2,11 January 2002,"Warning, Spoilers! We already know that this movie is going to suck since Myers won't be in it, but you'd think they can at least make a decent film. So far, this one is probably the worst of the series, even worse than Halloween 5(which also sucked, but at least it had some excitement). This movie had absolutely nothing decent about it. The plot was horrible the cast and setting wa bad. And it wasn't scary. Avoid at all costs. This movie gets a 1/10.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
298,Jack Smith - The King Of Horror,Original And Entertaining,7,20 February 2001,"CONTAINS SPOILERS!!! First things first. Fans of John Carpenter's seminal original HALLOWEEN should stay well away from this movie. Hulking, masked psychopath Michael Myers plays no part in HALLOWEEN III  SEASON OF THE WITCH which is a grisly re-working of the INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS theme. This time round the plot concerns an evil Irish toy maker who with the agency of sinister masks intends to return Halloween to its witchcraft origins by killing every child in America. As Halloween draws near a doctor, himself a stay away dad (oh the irony) is drawn into the depraved plot when workers at the mask factory are being admitted to hospital and later dying. He teams up with the sexy daughter of one of the plants victims and heads to the town where the mask factory is based and gradually discovers the fiendish plot. This is no horror classic because it is simply not scary but it is well made and acted (Tom Atkins is great) and gets full marks for originality. However it is the highly creative gore scenes that marked this film out for me. People die horribly as eyeballs are gouged out, heads are torn off, power drills are rammed through skulls and Halloween masks and commercials reduce kids heads to a writhing mass of bugs, snakes and centipedes that then kill their parents all culminating in one of the most downbeat endings ever. It is all shot through with a truly wicked sense of black humour and maintains a relentless intensity from start to finish. This film does not deserve to be a part of the awful HALLOWEEN series. As I have said this is no horror classic but it is still very entertaining and is truly one of a kind. Seek it out if you're a horror fan needing a break from the norm (like me). My Rating  7 out of 10",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
299,aelthric,Sorry but I just cannot suspend my disbelief to this extent,1,15 August 2011,"First I don't care about Michael Myers not being in this film or the fact that it is called Halloween III, I understand the Anthology nature in which Carpenter wanted to take the Halloween franchise and I am not a Michael Myers Fanboy either so that said on with my two pennies worth....Now generally to enjoy a film we are required to suspend our disbelief to a certain extent, after all we suspend our disbelief when a guy is shot several times at point blank range with no visible body armour and apparently shot dead only to end the film with the disappearance of his body as though he got up and walked away to get ready for a sequel...That's fine and we enjoy such nonsense because there really is nothing to compare it with in real life except possibly a Junkie on PCP who is oblivious to his injuries because of the drug...But this films premise is that this crazy old git has just managed to steal a huge block of stone from Stonehenge, a World Heritage site, without anybody noticing? Let me draw a comparison to a real life equivalent, everybody has heard of the Mount Rushmore monument yes? You know the big rock carvings of several United States Presidents in the side of a cliff?Do you think that if somebody stole one of the Presidents heads from Mount Rushmore tonight that anybody would notice it was gone tomorrow morning? I have visited Stonehenge several times and believe me unless it is a special day such as Summer Solstice you need some serious permits to even approach the Stones in the circle let alone taking heavy lifting gear to steal one, and it is this level of disbelief I find it hard to suspend which is what makes this film ridiculous even as entertainment...",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
300,boo_4ever,Less fun then actually dying yourself,1,20 March 2005,"Id like to write as little as possible about this ""film"". But one half of me wants to continue thinking it might be fun to rip it apart.Firstly, this isn't a bona fide sequel in the Halloween series. This isn't a sequel to anything at all, which in a way is fortunate as I cant imagine another film in this god forsaken vein. An evil toymaker is making evil masks which when worn in front of the TV during an evil commercial playing an evil hypnotic song turns kids......evil. Or dead. Its just as bad as it sounds. Oh and there are robots too. Well there are people you see who do the evil bidding but when you kill them they aren't actually evil - they're robots. And have yellow blood and everything. Oh and the evil theme song? At least something in the film was genuinely evil. If I hear that one more time I'm gonna smash my TV in. I'm surprised the people in the film weren't all turned in raving psychos before anything could happen due to the fact the commercial seemed to be on ALL the radio and TV stations ALL the time? The film has some little moments. A guy gets his head ripped off but the impact is lessened later when you realise it was done by an EVIL ROBOT. The test run of the EVIL COMMERCIAL and the effects it has on a family was pretty good. Until that is it ran on and on and on and on....in the end the production crew must have thrown half the zoo in on the kids body such was the amount of spiders, snakes, worms, centipedes and anything else that looked green or yucky. Talk about overkill. I cant remember at what point I woke up after that scene. Oh yeah the bit when the guy finds out his girlfriend was an EVIL ROBOT. Something you think you would notice after having sex with her not half an hour ago. Maybe he was just so into it he didn't notice all the metal and gooey yellow bits. What an attentive lover.Its easy to see why that felt the need to tack on the Halloween name on this shambles of a picture. Calling it what it is - ""EVIL ROBOTS SELL EVIL MASKS TO KIDS WHILE GUY HAS SEX WITH AFFOREMENTIONED EVIL ROBOT AND Doesn't NOTICE"" might have given it some redeeming features. The phrase ""its so bad its good"" seems to be a favourite on IMDb.com. I wont use it on this film because its so bad that it is just satanically terrible. A part of me died while watching this film. My love for sex with people I would automatically assume are human.Save yourself. Rent Battlefield Earth instead.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
301,cny_cd,"Decent horror film, but without Mr. Myers, this really isn't a ""Halloween"" film.....",6,27 January 2010,"As a standalone film, this is a pretty decent horror film, but the biggest mistake this film makes is in its title. Had this just been called ""The Season Of The Witch"", it would have had much more credibility of its own, rather than trying to be a part of the ""Halloween"" series. I understand and appreciate what the producers were trying to do, but a ""Halloween"" movie without Michael Myers is doomed from the start. The story and plot is very interesting and unique, and the acting is pretty good. This does have its ""campy"" and ""its so bad its good"" moments, but overall this is well worth a look if you are a horror movie fan. Just don't expect Michael Myers to be in this, because he isn't.

304,rexmagicman,Absolutely love this movie!,10,6 September 2021,"I saw this when it originally came out in the theatre, with my mom and dad. They were excited to see it, as I had told them (from reading about it in my Fangoria or Famous Monsters of Filmland magazines) that they were taking the franchise in a new direction, and that each ""sequel"" after Part 2 was going to focus on a new story that had nothing to do with Michael Myers. We loved Halloween, but were excited to have even more Halloween-theme type movies coming out. This one did not disappoint. Just bought the Shout Factory Blu-ray, and wow, it looks like it was filmed last week. Tom Atkins and Stacey Nelkin are a great duo, and Dan O'Herlihy a great creepy villain. Quite a bit of gore for it's time, and the effects are wonderful....love practical effects compared to CGI and I remember my parents loving this movie as much as I did --- we went and saw it again the following week as a matter-of-fact we liked it that much. And I remember how disappointed they were that the franchise didn't go the direction of making more movies like this one. Excellent cinematography, spooky 80's style score, super-creepy atmosphere, excellent acting by everyone, even down to the bit players (love Garn Stephens' role as ""Marge"" and her death scene --- made my mom, dad and I jump like you wouldn't believe --- lost half our popcorn!).

Tommy Lee Wallace directs this. He also directed IT in the future which was horrifying. this movie is scarier than all of the halloween movies. there is sci-fi terror sequences throughout. well it is about an evil toymaker who plans to kill all kids on earth in the world on halloween, when they watch his show with the masks on it makes there face burn up and turn into creepy creatures such as rattlesnakes. the scene of the kid dying and his face disolving into the creepy crawlers was horrifying, other scenes like the men in toxedos popping up out of no where with sound effects that surprise and scare you, are horrifying too, this movie isn't bad but its not good either . the acting is somewhat OK but its not that great. the story is ridiculous and its not too great. it is scary but i wouldn't watch it if i were you, watch the michael myers ones ,there not scarrier but there funner, you'll get more enjoyment out of those Rated R for Sci-fi Violence,Terror,Some Language, and Sexuality",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
306,omp9,Don't judge a book by its cover,6,4 June 2015,"Back in the days when I was younger I used to hate this movie, I loved watching the Halloween movies with Sam Loomis and Michael Myers, since Season of the Witch had none of them, I didn't even try to like it. Most of this film criticism probably comes from this fact that this has nothing to do with to first two movies, it's not even a slasher movie. It's about this evil mastermind and his mask-making company who plans to kill millions of American children with something mystical hidden inside the popular Halloween masks. Dan O'Herlihy who plays the villain is great and so is Tom Atkins (one of the more underrated Horror/Action stars out there). I think the story is nice and original and fits the Halloween theme well. The Score is great and contributes to create a haunting atmosphere. Halloween 3: Season of the Witch deserve a identity of it's own, having witch in the title is confusing as well since there ain't no witches either. But this isn't a bad movie, nothing really horrible about it, give it a go.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

308,Tanuccoon,Sometimes it's better to stick with what you know...,1,26 July 2004,"First of all, I'd like to state that I'd never been a fan of the Halloween series. So I was pleasantly surprised when I didn't see Michael Meyer's familiar ""face"" in this movie. However, that pleasure ended roughly halfway to three quarters into the movie when all of that beautiful suspense boiled down into wild inconsistencies, plot contrivances, and scenes that just boggle the mind.Our story begins with a panicked man clutching a mask. His wild performance helps build our nagging curiosity and in fact, a good portion of the movie progresses before we even get a solid clue to what's going on (although cleverly enough, they've hid a few earlier on in the movie in just obscure references). Finally, we begin to put the pieces together and are left... more confused?Apparently, they decided to play Frankenstein with Halloween 3, incorporating a bizarre mix of pseudo-technology (as I'm not even touching the androids) and ""magic."" The largest stretch is possibly the fact that a company that only produces three cheap kinds of masks somehow is also a major corporation that somehow is also secretly leading the world not only in robots, but in the creation of artificial intelligence to go along with those robots. However, I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt, as these aren't even the worst aspects of the movie.Putting aside bizarre twists (such as one where a switch could have been made, although I'm not even certain what they were going for), some exceedingly confusing parts (I'm not sure where these crickets came from, if the parents had died, or anything), and of course, a plot hole here and there, we get to the part that really ticks me off. Now a guy who has a master plan to slaughter literally millions MUST have a great reason for doing it or be completely insane, right? Wrong. The long drawn out explanation by Cochran near the end is more of an excuse to the viewers. I'd prefer an apology after sitting through 60 minutes and then hear him call it something along the lines of the ultimate halloween prank. The complete lack of any kind of justification, no matter how twisted it may be, or even a real reason for doing it (at this point, I'd even settle for a pact with Satan-- after all, he's about the only thing not in the film!) made me seriously consider how I had just wasted two hours.Although Halloween III was positively riveting in the beginning and the memorable repetitive commercial (sung to the tune of ""London Bridge is Falling Down""), any truly novel aspects of the film were simply destroyed by trying to move into too many bizarre angles. This could have been a truly great movie without the almost comical androids(?) and dozens of problems that should have never made it to the shooting. The series tried to do something a little different and failed miserably due to shoddy work. Sometimes it really is best to stick with what you know, even if that's not altogether great to begin with",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

Instead the makers got this bright idea to come up with a completely different movie with a stupid, uninteresting plot about masks. The characters are all different and unlikable. The acting was horrible and was almost laughable. (That is if your eyes didn't burn from watching it) This movie shouldn't even be considered part of the Halloween series we've come to know and love.

Halloween II had a toasty (try and work out if that was a pun or not) ending. The writers decided that each Halloween film would be a different story but still related to the Halloween season. Unfortunately, it did not quite work out. Halloween III received many bad reviews. May I say that I loved this motion picture. Halloween III is a great horror movie and I enjoyed it very much. One of the reasons I like it is because it is a fresh story. Halloween III refreshes audience of the first two films. It also mixes horror with science-fiction and the combination works very well. I personally think that Halloween III: Season of the Witch is better than H5 and most probably H6. The acting is this film entertained me too. Tom Aktins delivered a great performance as his character, and Dan O'Herlihy was good in this movie too. A good dose of humour will also be caught in this movie too. Unfortunately this movie didn't work out so well with critics so they went back to the same storyline as in H2 and H1.

So it was with a bit of unavoidable nostalgia that I rewatched it again. The transfer on the Universal Studios DVD was quite lovely. I also enjoyed trying to pick out what synthesizers might have been used for the score (also fun to do with Halloween 1. Oberheim fans will also like the score.) There is no reason to avoid Halloween 3, just because a few dogmatics say you should, don't let those people intimidate you out of something you might enjoy. No, Michael Myers isn't a part of the plot; no, there's no Jamie Lee; no, it didn't exactly get a ringing endorsement from Carpenter; yes, there is an aggravating ""unmotivated romance"" (thank you, modelminority dot com for the term). But this flick actually does have the kitchen sink: Pre-Catholic Irish witches, Stonehenge Implants, the Company-Town-Turned-Surveillance-Society, complete with buzzing cameras and automatons in suit and tie; infernal proto-multinational capitalists complete with hypnotic, brain-disintegrating marketing campaigns; and the scariest premise of all, eeeevil Tee Vee, that vitreous humor of American pop culture!It'll fry your brain! Don't sit too close! The Government is watching you! You'll ruin your eyes!! You'll get cancer and die in amputation surgery! Your halloween mask will melt and snakes will come out of your nose! Americans been repeating bizarre fantasies about Tee Vee to ourselves since some time in the late 20s. Halloween 3 exploits this fear of Tee Vee.Recommendation: watch as an eeeevil Tee Vee double feature with child-heroic contemporaneous Poltergeist (1982), the contemporary child-hating Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (2005) or even Videodrome (1981), which takes the idea of eeeevil Tee Vee with a philosophy and method, to its nightmarish limit.If you want a poorly-acted double feature, go with Halloween 3 and an eeevil Tee Vee Lee Majors flick called Agency (1980).Too bad Halloween 3 is locked by history into the 3rd circle of Halloween Purgatory, as it might have made a decent remake.Halloween 17: Season of the Union-busting CEO.

I have read the reviews and there are some valid points but why attach it to Halloween? It could have easily been a standalone film and without the Halloween tag OK. I remember not much about the film or the ludicrous premise on the narrative. If I go to the movies to see, for example, the latest Bond I expect to see him in that movie as I expected to see Michael Myers, good or poor and there have been a few now. So my disappointment wasn't directly the film it was unexpected in a bad way.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
320,TheDoomSong,Abysmal,2,5 July 2010,"I've always been a fan of Carpenter's original classic but beyond the first part I've never been very interested in the franchise. Sure, I've seen some sequel or the other on the small screen, even rented the remake a while ago, but the whole ""Michael Myers-Universe"" never did much for me. So, when I saw this flick last night, the pre-known fact that Michael would not be in it, that ""Season of the Witch"" actually has nothing to do whatsoever with the rest of the canon, it did not matter to me.What did was an abysmally bad performance by every single actor (with the exception of maybe O'Herlihy), a ludicrous screenplay that goes absolutely nowhere and falls apart between black magic, gimmicks and robot zombie businessmen and the worst editing I've ever experienced in my entire life. Nothing in this movie works or makes sense. At best it is mildly amusing for the enormous plot holes and the almost comically bad acting. The male and the female lead have sex, although there is neither a romantic, nor a sexual build-up of tension. Stylewise Wallace ""borrows"" exclusively from mentor Carpenter, so he never develops his own style but regurgitates a washed-out version of everything his master is known for (anamorphic camera, still shots of people standing put, anti-hero lead). Especially the open end, something I often enjoyed in Carpenter's oeuvre, is beyond good and evil. It's so sad and such a painfully obvious evidence for the director's cluelessness that it renders the movie almost unwatchable. And don't get me started on the power drill-scene or the ""showdown""-fight with the zombie-robot-chick - lousy.The only cool thing about it is Carpenter's synth-music, which is subtle and nice to listen to. The movie itself is an abomination and can only be enjoyed for its accidentally comical scenes.

321,jacobconnelly-47681,Creepy and Atmospheric Stand Alone Entry in the Series,8,19 May 2019,"People always act like Halloween III is the worst entry in the Halloween franchise - a franchise that gave us The Curse of Michael Myers AND Halloween: Resurrection. Nope. This one is actually one of the better sequels because it tries to go in a different, more interesting direction. It still takes place on Halloween and is full of autumn atmosphere, but there are no mask-wearing slashers afoot. Instead, we're treated to a story about witchcraft, consumerism, and small town paranoia. Maybe that's not what audiences in 1982 wanted, but people rarely want what's good for them.I beg you all to watch it and enjoy it on its own merits, because this really is a well made, interesting film.

326,owen-47103,Dr Who and The Satanic Toymaker,1,15 February 2019,"Though frequently lauded as a classic by horror fans, director John Carpenter's tyro slasher flick Halloween (1978) is hardly a great film; cheaply produced, with a weak script, underpowered cast and cardboard characters, it is redeemed mainly by its storytelling economy and simple, direct formula, which would become the pattern and prototype for a legion of subsequent imitators (though few would be even as modestly well executed).This, the second sequel - following a retreaded second effort on a considerably expanded budget but with a considerably poorer return - although directed and co-scripted by Tommy Lee Wallace, who would go on to direct the TV version of IT (1990), bears all the hallmarks of producer/co-writer/composer Carpenter's late-80's creative slide; after the relative heights of Escape From New York (1981), the big-budget breakout of The Thing (1982) and the genre-bending lunacy of Big Trouble in Little China (1984), Carpenter's output entered a terminal decline from which he has never fully recovered, characterised by weak storylines, low production value, underdeveloped scripts and often careless filmmaking.Dispensing with The Shape/Michael Myers, the silent, unkillable, knife-wielding stalker that animated the first two pictures (indeed going so far as to present both as fictional narratives, effectively rubbishing them in the process), H3 plays like an R-rated Dr Who episode, with a contrived plot concerning an evil Irish toymaker who plots to kill millions of children on Halloween night, in order to return the festival of Halloween - or Samhain - to its roots as a pagan right. A Doctor (who?) and the daughter of a toyshop owner killed by a zombie-ish suited assassin, who then immediately self-immolates (why?), set out to solve the mystery.If that sounds a little like an extended Scooby-Doo plotline, well, you're not far off. Originally scripted by Nigel Kneale, whose Quatermass series established a kind of low rent, tatty-but-interesting, cerebral sci-fi formula in British film and television, the concept has all the markers of belonging to a 1960s TV serial, and is crudely fleshed out (pun intended) with some relatively soft 80s gore and titillation. Managing, at least in Carpenter and Wallace's rewritten form (Kneale sued to have his name removed from the credits) to be both illogical, dull and highly improbable all at the same time, the listless plot and undernourished script feel impossibly stretched, even at the film's modest 95min running time, and remains unredeemed even by the sterling presence of Dan O'Herlihy (best known as The Old Man from RoboCop (1987)). The usually dependable Tom Atkins and newcomer Stacy Nelkin are astonishingly blank as the leads, and a parade of clumsy stereotypes (""top o' the morning to ye, to be sure"") make up the undistinguished supporting cast.Much of this would be forgivable, or at least tolerable, if the film were competently assembled. Unfortunately it is almost blinding inept on virtually every level; the photography is murky and opaque, sound effects and music alternate between irritatingly insistent and amateurishly crude, scenes begin and end with no discernible impact on the plot, characters fall in love after a few unremarkable moments of screen time, the villian reveals his grand scheme in detail for no particular reason (and it still makes no sense), and his plans are ultimately foiled with ridiculous ease...Really it would be churlish to list all of the film's faults, as virtually every scene contains anomalous or incredible details that should never have passed script review. Better simply to describe this as a catagorical failure of screen craft, a crudely cynical undertaking from the concept stage forward, and a bewilderingly worthless extension of a film franchise that had clearly exhausted the interest of all those involved in it to that point. Although this still, somehow, made book at the box office in 82, it would be 6 more years before another Halloween picture would surface, and that would wisely return to the simple stalk-and-slash premise that had served the earlier installments. Hardly oscar-worthy stuff, but still vastly preferable to this childish, Saturday-morning-cartoon rubbish.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

329,lucky_dice_mgt,The best in the series...,8,24 February 2006,"Okay,lets look at this with some real perspective.Hats off to the producer/director for taking the big risk of trying to write a whole new script/storyline and veer from the success of the Micahel Myers ..teenagers in jeopardy horror film {which I find boring} .IMO Halloween 3 is the best/scariest/most original/well acted movie in the series and certainly much more enjoyable then the over rated original.I watch this movie every year around Halloween {but I make sure to stay clear of the 1st- 70s version} and it always entertains me even after repeated viewings.Of course because the film deviates from what everyone else expected it to be about, it bombed at the box office and got slammed by critics alike.Such ashame that the average person would have been more entertained if this 3rd installment in the series had once again been about Michael and his stupid mask yielding his knife and killing teenagers that couldn't act or speak interesting dialog.I will never cease to be amazed at how ""inept"" the masses of people can be.Many reviewers of this film use a simliar logic in claiming it so awful , by stating the story is to unbelievable { and it is } but almost all horror films have unbelievable story lines/ villains. For example, what could be more unbelievable then the original Halloween and all the ones that followed it that resurrected the Michael Myers character ? I mean is it believable that multiple gunshot wounds , impalements, 12 "" sewing needles shoved directly into the eyeball, 30 ft falls off of a balcony , etc, cannot kill Michael Myers ? If we compare the originality of the story , acting, dialog , etc of Season of the Witch to the original Halloween , it would seem obvious to me which movie comes out FAR ahead. The very fact that the masses in society hated Season of the Witch so much, helps prove why Hollywood horror films have become so repetitive and outright boring . Season of the Witch was such a refreshing change from the rubber stamped , killer in a mask scenario, that people in society did not know how to accept it , therefore , they hated it because they were pre-programmed to want to see yet another film about a evil entity they had already viewed in 2 prior films. Because of this, we have to balme both Hollywood and our society for the lack of creative horror films that the film industry has been cranking out on a high percentage for the last 20 + years. It only makes sense that if horror film fans and critics cannot accept and appreciate new and creative horror films that are willing to diverge from the same old themes , then Hollywood will not want to take the risk of bringing such films to the market. The only 2 things I can think about Season of Witch that are slightly annoying are :1. Its unbelievability { which is about the same level of the Michael Myers character }2. The lil "" jingle"" theme that is played about 8 times throughout the film . My sincere recomeendations to anyone who hates this movie : Totally forget that the Michael Myers character exists, watch Season of the Witch one more time, don't try and anaylize the storyline or try to make it seem believable , and enjoy the creativeness of the plot/ characters, and recognize that the acting and dialog is MUCH better then most of the other Michael Myers Halloween films !",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

332,stormofwar,"Not a bad movie, but misleading.",3,7 April 2008,"I suppose I shouldn't have been surprised. I caught this on cable last night (OnDemand) and was hoping for a slasher flick. Instead, what I got is more a ""psychological"" thriller then blood, though there was a fair amount of it.The story centers around on character of Dr. Challis, a doctor who gives up his weekend dad duties (divorced) and goes on a romp (sexcapade?) with a murdered patient's daughter to a town where the world's largest supplier of halloween masks has a diabolical scheme to bring about a dead god by sacrificing the children of America though means of a magical (via the dust of Stonehenge) and technological device to bring about snakes and all sorts of nasty crawlies. By the way, none of this is explained in any sort of appreciable detail.All in all, this could have been a great movie, story wise, could they have found a way to cut down the plot holes, but, per the usual 80's horror B film fair, they didn't. That being the case, I was expecting some sort of the showing by Michael Myers. I was sadly disappointed.That being the case, there is not direct link to the franchise in terms of story or character, save for the title (which I would argue doesn't belong in the franchise) and various movie trailer ads for the original movie strewn throughout the movie.All things being equal, this could have done well on its own, but I feel ripped off, but taken on its own, it's standard fair for the day and genre.

334,Mister_Gordon_Shumway,Season of the Witch,8,3 December 2007,"Where is Michael Myers? This question relates to the majority of reviews that slate 'Season of the Witch', the third instalment of the 'Halloween' franchise that appears as relentless as the psychopathic killer himself. How can there be a 'Halloween' movie without Michael Myers? I disagree.'Halloween III: Season of the Witch' was never meant to include the psychologically-disturbed menace of suburban America. Tommy Lee Wallace (Stephen King's 'IT') - in his first attempt at directing a feature film - wanted to avoid another 'slasher' sequel and instead concentrated on exploring the domestic roots of Halloween and its relationship to Celtic folklore.So what is the general plot here? Conal Cochran (Dan O'Herlihy), a demented toymaker, has produced millions of Halloween masks, inside which pieces of the monument Stonehenge are buried. Through corporate advertising, Cochran has the world spellbound and craving for the day when they can don the masks and watch 'the great giveaway' on 31 October. His plans are to commit mass genocide, his victims mainly being the world's population of children, thus re-enacting the sacrifices that supposedly occurred hundreds of years ago at ritualistic monuments like Stonehenge. The story closely follows the legend of Samhain, the Celtic lord of death - the very God that children and animals were supposedly offered to as a sacrifice on the one night when the dead and the living walk together and children go 'begging for candy'. Indeed, Cochran is attempting to re-awaken the Celtic festival by way of the traditional elements of witchcraft and modern technology.Dr Dan Challis (Tom Atkins, 'The Fog' & 'Creepshow') decides to investigate the goings on within the confines of Cochran's toy factory in the remote Irish state of Santa Mira, California. He is suspicious of the Silver Shamrock masks - skull, witch & Jack-o'-Lantern - that are being produced inside the factory. The building and surrounding town are guarded by androids resembling humans, mechanical slaves created by the toymaker. He must stop Cochran and warn the world before the advert goes out on Halloween night.'Not enough gore' is the general consensus, and critics have universally damned the film as a sub-average thriller. The film is nevertheless a breath of fresh air - Michael Myers returning from the grave (alongside his other 'slasher' brothers, Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees) becomes tiresome despite their ongoing popularity; the story lines being weak and predictable. 'Season of the Witch' boasts originality and examines the real legend of Halloween, the Festival of Samhain.John Carpenter produced and wrote the score for Halloween III: Season of the Witch, and it is good to see that the director of the first film (arguably the best horror movie ever directed) was involved in the project. 'Halloween III', I think, was the only original sequel in the series and the most accomplished of the subsequent 'Halloween' films ... until Rob Zombie came along and directed 'the' best re-make of a 1970s/1980s horror film.But that's another story.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

People seem to immediately dismiss it as a bad film simply because their favorite slasher character has been removed. Calling it ""Halloween 3"" was obviously a bad idea.The story starts out with a man being chased(by whom we don't yet know). He eventually makes it to a gas station where the attendant drives him to a nearby hospital. He's rolled in on a stretcher, clutching a halloween mask and saying ""They're going to kill us."". Again, we don't know who ""they"" are. Shortly after, while he's sleeping, the assassin enters his room and rips his skull apart. The assassin promptly leaves the hospital, gets into his car, soaks himself in gasoline, and lights a match. The next day the man's daughter is brought in to identify his body. Atkins is on hand to begin a little investigation into why somebody would want to kill her father. From that point on, the plot gets pretty unusual, involving everything from androids to stonehenge.Writer/director Tommy Lee Wallace(Stephen King's It) keeps everything moving pretty slowly throughout the film as weird goings on are observed by the two leads. Wallace gives his film a genuinely creepy atmosphere with the ""test"" sequence being a clear standout.While it's far from being the best in the series it is a good Twilight Zone style film.

The master plan to kill children is based on the assumption that they will be sitting in front of a television at exactly 9:00 p.m. on Halloween while wearing a rubber mask over their head?  And they will be doing this because commercials say that they will announce a ""big giveaway"" at that time?  Gee, my kids never watch TV while wearing their masks and are kind of busy with other things at 9:00 p.m. on Halloween.   6.  No one seems to notice these metallic discs on the back of their masks?   7.  The metallic disks are show to have fragile microcircuitry but upon malfunctioning are able to arc out forces sufficient to melt human faces (powered by a chip from a stone from Stonehenge.)   8. Some yellow organic gooey substance oozes out of androids.   9.  The androids are killed when the good guys drop the microchips on them even though the androids are accustomed to being around the microchips all the time.  Fortunately, the androids die while standing in a perfect circle, which causes a magical force circle to appear which somehow bounces over to the evil scientist which -  oh forget it, its too stupid to repeat.  I could go on and on, but this is taking time away from my new obsession: manufacturing a Stacey-Nelkin sex-toy android in my basement.   Rating: 3/10",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

In a way I do understand. The filmmakers went for something different and people just didn't bite so they went back to Michael Myers.Regardless, this film is an indelible part of my childhood. It delves into the occult and the concept of remotely inflicting harm through television signals. If that isn't a cool idea for a movie, I don't know what is. It's cold blooded (sacrifice of innocent children to the gods) and bares all the hallmarks of having been ghost directed by John Carpenter (compact narrative and perfectly geometric framing from beginning to end).I feel obligated also to stick up for this movie because I sense that some of the hate thrown its' way is somewhat irrational and there's a dog-pile aspect to it. If that is the case I would urge people to lighten up and give this film a second glance.

352,lodewijkpollemans,The stigma for every Halloween-fan,1,29 August 2008,"I am not even going to explain this movie's plot, since it is as thin as a piece of paper and its certainly not enough to keep someones attention throughout the film. Basically, if you are a fan of the original Halloween, you can forget about everything that made that movie a classic. The great theme-song by Carpenter is gone, and so is Michael Myers and Jamie Lee Curtis. I just can't figure out what the creators where thinking when they came up with this... Its like making a James Bond movie without James Bond. Or better yet; a Friday the 13th movie without Jason. It is doomed to fail and this movie rightfully did so because this is a stain on the horrorgenre and incorporates NO entertainment value at all.What you get instead, is this weird plot about haunted Halloween-masks. It isn't exactly scary what so ever, and the stunningly bad acting doesn't help either. And if you thought it was already bad that the movie doesn't include the original Halloween-score, then you will be even more amazed by the fact that this has been replaced with the most terrible annoying pieces of music ever that plays on commercials throughout the film. It has been composed to give you a headache and if you completely watched this piece of junk it will make you wish you've never layed eyes on this awful movie. Trust me when I say that it goes on, and on, and on, and on, and on.On top of that, the horror-element is also very shallow. So fans of gore and splatter can skip this movie right away. Season of the Witch (I'm not even going to call it Halloween 3) is also one of the most boring pieces of film-making I have ever witnessed. And just when you thought ""maybe the creators saved the best for last"" you will be confronted with one of the most shitty endings in movie-history, and all the hope you initially had for this garbage is crushed. Its like the creators just ran out of money and wrote the ending in 5 sentences or so. It pisses me off to no end and does not satisfy the viewers endurance for this film what so ever. It only makes you feel ripped off, and thats just what this is; a rip-off.Don't even think about renting it for fun either, because its not. Its not one of those hilarious bad B-movies, this is just plain mediocre and boring. It includes no humour what so ever, it has one of the most uninspired dialogs ever, and more importantly it signed the deathmark of Halloween as a series.

It's a shame that Carpenter/Hill didn't continue the Halloween-themed series that they initially planned to do. I would have enjoyed creative films like this one.Again, if you think this film is sub-par, go back and watch the late-70s and early-80s slasher crap that we were bombarded with.

357,larsgorzelak,Strange and slightly fascinating,8,27 December 2004,"I like ""Halloween III"". Some people consider it to be one of those ""so bad it's good"" kind of films, but they're wrong. It's competently made and much better than the ""Halloween"" films that appeared after it. As sequels go it's pretty strange, though. For starters, Michael Myers is nowhere in sight. This second sequel has nothing to do with the two previous films in the series (personally I couldn't care less about that) and the plot is downright weird. What's strange about it is that there's very little symbolism at stake - something which is rare in occult horror films. Normally, filmmakers seem to feel that they need some sort of psychological excuse to show us unrealistic horror. Not so in ""Halloween III"". We never get to know the main characters and get only the most superficial impression of their personalities. The sinister goings-on in the film have nothing to do with the personal traumas of the protagonist - he's just there because he has to be, in order for the plot to move on. In this sense, the film is refreshingly ""naive"". The atmosphere or tone of the film is why I like it. It has that ""midnight movie"" feel, mainly - I think - because of the soundtrack. Music is rarely used, but always effectively like in John Carpenters ""The Thing"" (1982). And there are some almost surreal images thrown in along the way, like the one where snakes surprisingly appear from within the pumpkinhead.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
358,Horrorfan1995,Not as bad as everyone says,7,12 August 2010,"I can't say that Halloween III: Season of the Witch is one of the worst films in the series, It definitely was one of my favorites.But to this day, many people are confused of why they called it Halloween III if it didn't have anything to the series. So, what was the answer to why Halloween III is the way it is? It was simple, Halloween started Michael Myers, and Halloween II definitely killed him off meaning John Carpenter was done with him, so when the 3rd movie came out, they decided to make the Halloween franchise an Anthology series.The music was creepy and it showed a kid getting killed, the villain though, Coral Cochran, he really tries celebrate this Halloween trying to return it to its original roots.I say that the series would have been better if it was an Anthology series then just rehashing the same Michael Myers plot over and over again.But in all honesty, Halloween III is not as bad as everyone says, it definitely had an original plot and some unique twists to it, so overall, I recommend seeing this movie.7/10",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
359,Verdugo85,An underrated gem,8,14 May 2018,"Yes, its got the title ""Halloween"" because John Carpenter's intention for the Halloween franchise was to make an anthology series set on Halloween. The first film was about the boogeyman (Michael Myers) but then they made a sequel, Halloween II, to conclude the story of Michael Myers. Halloween III: Season Of The Witch is the first of anthology series that tells the story about a Doctor Dan Challis (Tom Atkins) investigating the mysterious murder of his patient in his hospital. His search for the truth takes him to a small town in Santa Mira, California where an evil organization called ""Silver Shamrock Novelties"" owned by Conal Cochran (Dan O'Herlihy) operates there. Cochran makes ""harmless"" Halloween masks for children. He plans to sell them in the whole US on October 31st but these deadly masks have a microchip installed on the back below the masks that when the children (including Dr. Challis kids) wear these masks and watches the ""Silver shamrock"" commercial up close to the tv their heads will explode. The source that triggers the explosion is from a mystic power of a stonehenge rocks. Cochran has android un-named henchmen (Dick Warlock is one of them) out to dispose those who might be a threat to his wicked plan. This is a really good creepy horror film. The plot, the creepy music, the villain, graphic violence, characters, etc. Yes, I get that Michael Myers was not in it but so what? Watch the film from a different point of view. My only problem with this film is that it wasnt set in the same universe with Michael Myers, I wish it was. This film is set in a separate realistic universe where Michael Myers is a fictional character as proof where theres a scene where Dr. Challis is in a bar and a Halloween 1978 commercial premiere airs on tv and then later on when Challis is kidnapped, Cochran puts one of his masks on Challis.
 and turns on a tv airing Halloween 1978, *sigh*. Halloween III was box office disappointment because, again, Michael Myers absence angered fans this is why six years later Michael Myers was brought back in Halloween 4.""oh and..Happy Halloween..""",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

366,jjpurwitsky,The Halloween Saga: Halloween III - Season of the Witch,7,8 July 2012,"The release of Halloween II was significant for two reasons. One, it showed that audiences were still eager to see the continuing adventures of Michael and Laurie and two, signified the supposed end of the Michael Myers saga. Making back ten times its budget, Halloween II was a bona fide success. And production started immediately on a third movie.At the same time, production had begun on Friday the 13th Part 3 and, while producing the third Halloween, John Carpenter directed and released the gruesome (and highly underrated at the time) The Thing. The third Friday movie was released in 3D and two months before the third Halloween. And like it's predecessors, it was a box office hit. Audiences were eating up the cinematic tales of unstoppable killing machines such as Jason Vorhees. A slew of other films were released to cash in on the craze including Frightmare, The House on Sorority Row and a sequel to the 'original slasher film', Psycho. Whether in the mainstream or underground circuit, these movies thrived with audiences in both theaters and the new 'concept' of home video.So while these slasher films were eating up the box office receipts, the producers of Halloween wanted more. Carpenter and producing partner Debra Hill were done with Michael Myers and his story. After all, he had died at the end of the second film. So they came up with the idea to make Halloween into a series in the vain of Night Gallery and Twilight Zone, only it would be theatrically based and each story would revolve around Halloween night. And thus, on the 22nd of October, 1983, Halloween III: Season of the Witch was released.Written and directed by Tommy Lee Wallace, Halloween III's plot revolves around a toy company that has evil and world ending plans and a doctor that comes across the diabolical plot and is the only one who can stop it. There are no connections so to speak to the previous Halloween movies in the script. In fact III goes as far as saying (which goes against what makes them scary) that part I and II were not 'real', not part of our world, by having it play on television in the background.There are though, stylistic connections to the previous Halloween films that can be found throughout the film. The credit sequence is a modern take on the pumpkin opening credits, the music is eerie and similar to the previous films, and the bad guys (well the henchmen) behave and act very much like Michael Myers in the second film. As well, Dean Cundey returns for the third time as cinematographer and brings his glorious use of lighting and lenses to the film, making it look very much like a 'Halloween' film.The lead actor in Halloween III is Tom Atkins, who does a decent job of carrying the movie. His (much younger) love interest is played by Stacey Nelkin, who is pretty and cute but doesn't add much to the story. Dan O'Herilhy eats up the scenery as the bad guy and his performance excels above everybody else in the picture. While most of the performances are good and enjoyable, there are a few minor roles that could have been cast better. They are badly acted and very wooden and they tend to ruin the atmosphere of the film, but they are few and far between and thus don't detract to much from the enjoyment to be had watching this film.The story is fun, original and keeps you awake and interested until the last minute. Even though it is filled with enough plot holes to sink the Titanic, it breezes by and feels a lot shorter than the 98 minute run time it has. Some neat (but very few) gore effects, an effective bad guy, eerie music, the killing of children and a rather enjoyable last 5 minutes make Halloween III an effective, but somewhat forgettable film.The biggest critique of Halloween III, and by no fault of it's own, is that this film, as mentioned earlier, has nothing to do with the previous films. After the astounding first film and the rather enjoyable second film, the news that a third film was being made was rather exciting. Unfortunately it is a third film in name only. Take out the III from the title, or take out Halloween completely and Season of the Witch would not disappoint horror aficionados. While not the greatest of films, Season of the Witch still manages to be fun and exciting. It hits the right buttons at the right moments and if nothing else, it can help keep you company on a lonely, miserable, cold, and dark rainy night.Film Rating: 70%Breakdown (How Halloween III: Season of the Witch scored 70%):Production Design: 7 out of 10 Cinematography: 8 out of 10 Re-playability: 7 out of 10 Originality: 7 out of 10 Costumes: 7 out of 10 Directing: 6 out of 10 Editing: 7 out of 10 Acting: 6 out of 10 Music: 9 out of 10 Script: 6 out of 10Check out all my reviews at www.fullmetalreviews.blogspot.com",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
367,troodon,Ignoring it's a sequel...,1,4 March 2004,"OK, it's fairly common knowledge that John Carpenter hadn't intended to make a series of nothing but movies about Mike Myers.  So the fact this had abslutely nothing to do with the first two movies isn't a relevant criticism; it wasn't SUPPOSED to.  In fact, this was orginally supposed to be the second, but Carpentar was pressured into making a direct sequal to the first Halloween.OK, having said that... this movie is still utter crap.  The story goes absolutely nowhere.  The ""evil plan"" makes no sense.  And for all the work the alleged ""hero"" goes through to stop it he might as well not even bothered.  There is absolutely no suspense in any of this.The premise could have worked, maybe, but it honestly just looks like Carpenter hurriedly threw this together based on that idea without bothering to develop anything.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
368,YankeeDood,Underrated,9,23 April 2004,"I've heard all the complaints about this movie and noticed that all are simply based on the fact Michael Myers is not in it. Some critics have complained that it was a poor storyline too.Well, I disagree with both views. If Michael isn't in part 3, who cares. This movie contains plenty of atmosphere and scenery to enjoy. But the acting and music score were also top notch. In fact, I like this music score (by Carpenter and Howarth) more than the first. The directing by largely underrated Tommy Wallace is exceptional too (he also plays the TV announcer's voice).H3 is a little slow moving, but the suspense picks up toward the end. My favorite scene is when Dr. Challis (Atkins) is searching for Ellie (Nelkin) in the old factory and comes across an elderly lady knitting. He asks here about Ellie, then the head falls off revealing a mechanical prop. This was plain eerie. I loved it.The climactic ending will surprise you too.

369,steveneven,Halloween III: Season of a Good Sequel,7,9 July 2014,"Before seeing ""Season of the Witch"", rather than being met with rancid, preconceived notions, I was actually quite intrigued to see it. The production stills looked very cool, and even the poster was extraordinary. Why? Because it looked like the film was going to capture that ""Halloween"" essence. Classic urban legend/mystery, eerie Halloween costumes/masks- downright to the spooky soundtrack. In no way, however, did I allow myself to love this movie or be less harsh on it JUST because I was slightly more excited for this sequel than some of the others. In that regard, how did ""Season of the Witch"" turn out? While the film may never reach cult status, I will be the first to say that the story here is probably one of my favorites for a horror movie- if not my favorite. But we will get into that in a little bit.What makes or breaks a ""Halloween"" movie that derails from the first three sequels and their predecessor is the story. If you do not have an engaging premise, what is the point? I can say with absolute certainty that the story here is very fun. A town secret that none of the visitors or regulars know, just the corporation that controls the town? A doctor who ventures off to a remote mask-making facility in the middle of nowhere? Creepy people dressed in little suits, with perfunctory movements that do not speak? It is like a sci-fi/horror fan's dream come true. What ""Season of the Witch"" is in a nutshell is Tom Atkins' character traveling with a guy's daughter, to the town he stayed at before he passed away. There, they uncover the truth about the ""Silver Shamrock masks"" and how the daughter's father had died, and many more secrets. But along the way, people go missing, questions sure have their answers, and people are watched.I already gushed over the story, but let us talk about the direction the director Tommy Lee Wallace takes us in. For one, the film is ALWAYS creepy. There is not one moment in the film where I felt comfortable, but in the best way possible. The soundtrack is seriously so ear-piercingly loud and unnerving, it just gets under your skin. Moreover, the characters themselves can be quirky and not exactly the most normal of civilians. This really accelerates the film because it is not some typical slasher with dumb teens. It is a unique story featuring adults who are not... well... dumb. That is another thing I liked about this sequel. Tom Atkins gives a great performance here. He can actually be quite funny at some points, sexy to the ladies, and he can fight crime (and use his brains). Also, the lead girl is a good sidekick. She might not be fierce, but she is cautious and can smell danger from a mile away. The supporting characters (well, there are not too many people in this movie), but they are fine. They do not detract from the movie, but they do not really support it either. But the one thing this movie gets right (which it gets flagged for) is the pacing. Not one shot is ugly, not one shot overstays its welcome. It is like everything has this coherent flow to it, which was great. And who can forget the deaths? Out of all the Halloweens, ""Season of the Witch"" is one of the more gruesome ( maybe sans the Zombie movies), but I prefer these deaths over the ones in his movies anyway. And that is because of this thing I like to call atmosphere. The rural setting, mixed with the fact that this movie takes place mostly in the dark, really just shakes you up. It definitely feels like a movie you would discover on some midnight Fearnet or AMC channel. It is perfect.Now what makes ""Season of the Witch"" shy of that 10? Believe it or not, I actually liked the cliffhanger ending, and I think the absence of Michael Myers gave this movie a breath of fresh air, but something about this movie is not up to par with Carpenter's original. I cannot put my finger on it, but I seriously feel that Wallace and Carpenter did the best they could with this one; I just do not think it is 9 or 10 worthy. Maybe an 8, but my 7 is solid enough. A 7, for a Halloween movie, but really for ANY movie, is still really good. I mean this movie has great re-watchability. This was my second time viewing it and it was just as great as the first. Maybe even better! Also, that opening sequence was awesome. And the masks! I just love this movie.I said what needed to be said. ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" is a great movie. It gets everything right. The script, the characters, the body count, the pacing, the direction. Maybe there are some problems I did not find with the movie, and I voted for ""Halloween (1978)"" being the best ""Halloween"" film, but golly, if this movie was not great. This is probably my favorite ""Halloween"" sequel, or close to it. Great, great movie.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
370,leumas3765,Not without its charm,4,7 March 2007,"Halloween III has taken on a new life on the AMC cable channel. It is used to pad some time during their ""Monsterfest"" marathon in the 10 days leading up to Halloween.It's not a good movie. People who like it, when asked, ""Do you want to see a movie that's like the Twilight Zone, only slower, longer, and not as good?"" would probably answer, ""You had me at Twilight Zone.""There are a few things to enjoy about this movie:1) The 1-man synthesizer soundtrack is pure early 80s. 2) Also for nostalgia lovers, this movie came out when personal computers had been out for about a year and any kind of computer graphics were considered cool. 3) The producers showed some guts by breaking from the formula (and unfortunately got creamed at the box office for it.) 4) It doesn't have an eye-rolling formulaic ending. 5) It turned out to be somewhat prophetic. 15 years after this movie came out, hundreds of Japanese children were stricken with seizures after watching an episode of ""Pokemon."" 6) If you like the song ""London Bridge,"" this is the movie for you.Unfortunately, it's kind of plodding and layers implausibility upon implausibility until it just gets too much.

(since currently, the Halloween stuff is moved to clearance by about October 20th to make room for Xmas stuff) *Would a factory so paranoid that it enforces a curfew on its citizens be a little suspicious of two buyers who showed up to get masks on October 29th without phoning first? *Why is Buddy Kupfer's family staying in a motel if they have a big RV? In fact, why is ""one of the richest men in the country"" staying in a cheap motel at all?*When are football games televised on Friday afternoon? *What makes divorced alcoholic 47 year old deadbeat dads attractive to hot 23 year olds? *Why are there so many leaves on the trees on October 31? *Has there ever been a lazier attempt at a montage of cities than the one that appears in this movie? *Wouldn't time zones put a kink in Cochran's wicked scheme? *Did network TV used to air horror movies at 7:00 PM? (""The Big Giveaway"" at 9:00 follows the airing of the original Halloween movie, with a run time of about 2 hours, including the inevitable commercials.)*Whom can you call to immediately pull programming from multiple networks, especially if you don't have any special credentials? *What did this movie have to do with witches or the Donovan song?I could have overlooked all those glaring problems if Cochran had shown even a modicum of motivation for his evil plan to murder all his customers (and ensure bankruptcy even if he dodges criminal proceedings) but the plot is so preposterous by the time Challis confronts him that Cochran can't even offer up a response.

John Carpenter didn't get the idea just after he made the second Halloween.  These stories were supposed to always change like Tale's From The Darkside.  He just wanted to wrap up what he started on Halloween.  This is not a bad film, either.  The problem was that this was technically a different genre then the other 2.  The other 2 were slasher film's and this was a horror film.  The plot was good, and the acting was fair.  I think this movie might have been made a little to early.

I think that one of the problems was that everybody was expecting a Michael Myers slasher movie and instead got a horror movie.  Now John Carpenter, Debra Hill, Moustapha Akkad did not expect for the first and second Halloween movies to be so successful, and were going to make sequels with same title and different story similar to Night Gallery.

Let's try to visualize the movie OK you got it in your head now take Halloween off of the title and just call it season of the witch. Now does it make the movie any better? No OK i didn't think so. John carpenter tried to do something different and i will give him the credit for that. But lets break this piece of garbage down. First the intro i must admit it had me hooked at the start the chase scene then hospital, i thought OK this is going some where. And you know what i was right it did go somewhere, right to crapper. The only person in this film who i even felt was trying is tom atkins. He gave the movie its best chance to be good and instead his efforts are just shut down. Lets not forget the silly story this Irish guy has control over the whole town because he owns a factory that makes Halloween mask's. Did i mention that they stole stone hinge. So they put the mask on you play a commercial you have a seizure and bugs eat your face. Plus all of the factory workers are robots. This sounds like bad cartoon and basically this is what it is. Its a family guy episode in real life, its comical at some points especially when tom decides hes going to sleep with the female lead. The question is simple where do you want to sleep? that's a stupid question miss whatever the girls name is. Now the music it sounds like robot's got together and had an orgy and forgot to oil themselves properly. So stay away from this garbage that's all i can say",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

Well why in the world do you care? He died! I mean, don't get me wrong, I love Michael Myers, and I love Dr. Loomis and Laurie Strode, but this is a new chapter. It's basically about a crazy Irishman who has a scheme to kill all of the children all over the world on Halloween night, and the efforts of an everyman to foil the plot.

I haven't got much to say about this movie but i didn't really like the idea of 3 masks which were pumpkin, witch and a skull that kill you on Halloween night when you watch this commerical.

383,poisontheewell,About As Bad As It Gets,1,3 September 2003,"Halloween III: Season of the Witch is about as bad as a horror film can ever be. Few films in this genre can get any worse. There are so many problems with this film that it's hard for me to figure out where to begin.One of the biggest problems with this film is that the storyline is about as absurd as it can get. This reminded me of something R.L. Stine would have written in his ""Goosebumps"" series. This may be scary to a seven year old, but nobody else.Another problem is that this has nothing to do at all with any of the other ""Halloween"" movies. It is an insult to the ""Halloween"" series that this picture is part of it. However, it is only fair to judge this film by itself, and not compare it to the other films in the series. Doing that, it is still an absolutely terrible waste of anybody's 90 minutes.And now my complaint about the main character. If anyone has ever seen ""Tootsie"" with Dustin Hoffman, just imagine the old actor in the television show. Dr. Daniel Challis from Halloween III and the old bad actor from ""Tootsie"" act almost completely the same. The only difference is that in ""Tootsie"" it was on purpose.""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" is a horrendous piece of crap, whether you are judging it on its own or with the other Halloween movies. Don't waste your time with this one.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
384,david-2271,People you don't care about doing things that make no sense,1,22 November 2006,"Personally, I don't care about the absence of Michael Myers from this movie. I was very disappointed with Halloween II and was looking forward to a new direction. Little did I know that the direction was straight into the garbage.The thrust of the movie is this; a toymaker has stolen a piece of Stonehenge and smuggled it into California. He has sold millions of masks (in only three, highly clichéd designs) and has enticed his young purchasers to watch a commercial, that will somehow be seen by all the children of the US at the same time, regardless of the time zone they live in. When they watch the commercial, the children will be eaten from the inside by bugs and snakes. Oh, and some uninteresting people are trying to stop him.The movie falls apart when you consider that the villain has expended a huge amount of effort on his plan, but has neglected to give a reason why he should do so. He mentions wanting to bring back the fear of the old pagan gods, but for what? Wealth and power? He clearly has plenty of that already. Is he a religious fanatic? Okay, but how does mass murder further his cause? Is it all a big Halloween prank? You don't commit mass murder for a prank on the people of the US, you hire David Lynch and have him make a show called ""Twin Peaks."" Some will try to jump in and point out that Michael Myers had obscure motives for his murders. This reasoning neglects the fact that Myers was a solo operator using very simple methods. The audience isn't supposed to understand him, they are supposed to fear him, plain and simple.The villain of Halloween III, by contrast, has an amazingly detailed and convoluted plan. He must have had moxie to set this up, and he must have had a clear goal to put out the effort he did. In a case liken this, the audience cannot help but think what his motivations and goals might be. When a movie sets the audience up for big payoff, then blows it off, it deserves nothing more than to be labeled a one-star cheat.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

A horror masterpiece and the father of the slasher film. Halloween 2 wasn't bad, but really added nothing to the series and was more of the same.So while it may have been a risky decision to make a third film completely seperate from the other two, I think it was quite a good one. With the second film, the series was looking a tad worse for wear, so this seperate story was needed in a way. You just need to make sure, before you watch it, that you're not expecting Michael and Laurie to run across your screen (apart from the Halloween trailer cameo).The plot was great, and revealed itself well, and while it was quite silly in places, and completely off the wall in others, I personally think that this was a great addition to the series, and a highly enjoyable horror film.Guess I'd better go and buy Halloween 4...",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
386,KristofferAG,Disregard the title.,5,14 October 2014,"This movie shouldn't bear the Halloween name. It shouldn't be considered part of the franchise, but it is. If you go into this not expecting anything other than a horror B-movie, then you might leave somewhat satisfied. I did, at least.Apart from the movie taking place during Halloween, there's nothing in common with the series. A mad Brit is trying to eradicate humanity by using parts of a stone from Stonehenge (that he somehow managed to steal), latex Halloween masks, and a TV commercial. By attaching a tag that carries parts of the stone to the masks, he can somehow trigger a reaction by airing an epilepsy-inducing TV commercial at a time he knows all the kids will be watching, which will... make the masks rot, and the kids turn into bugs and snakes, that in turn will kill the parents.It's the perfect plan. Except, Conal Cochran (that's the mad Brit), didn't take the nosy doctor Challis into account, who hears about this from a seemingly deranged old man that arrives at his hospital while the other doctor is unavailable. This Doctor Challis is divorced, and clearly suffering from it, spending most of his time at the bar, or flirting with younger women. The deranged man is murdered at the hospital, death by having his cranium torn apart by a robot disguised as a human (controlled by Cochran, of course), and I'm gonna go ahead and guess that the reason the doctor is interested in the entire thing is because the deranged man had a really cute daughter. For some reason, without actually discussing it or getting to know each other, the two decide to pose as man and wife to infiltrate the small town where Cochran's company, Silver Shamrock, and its factories are located.Pretty much the first thing they do once they get a room at a motel, is have sex. True, they only have two days to solve this before god knows what happens, but first, sex. Considering how there's no actual nudity, I don't see how there's any point to the two having a sexual relationship whatsoever. But hey, I'm not the movie maker around here.The most infuriating part is that the movie tries to avoid having to explain anything at all by having the lead bad guy say ""trade secrets"". Still, with all that bashing done, the actor's aren't bad, and there were a couple moments that had me giggle. Some of the killings are seriously brutal, and all the insects definitely made me feel a bit uncomfortable. I wouldn't classify this as one of the ""so bad it's good"" movies. It's a decent flick if you want something that isn't too serious.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
387,CroatianSensation1975,Under rated horror classic.....,7,18 February 2007,"Halloween III: Season of the Witch, although carrying the same moniker as it's predecessors, has absolutely nothing to do with Michael Myers, the serial killer. For this reason, it seems there are many people that feel this is reason enough to bash this film. I am 100% certain, that if this film did not carry the Halloween title, it would definitely have scored higher that a 3.5 on this website. This is not the worst horror movie, I wouldn't even consider this film a horror. This film is a thriller, plain and simple. The only reason people categorize it as a horror, is due to the name. This is yet another classic movie in the vein of all other classic John Carpenter films.The story centers around a lunatic in a novelty factory, who is planning on using Halloween masks, to kill millions of American children on Halloween night. When a man is mysteriously killed in a hospital in California, clutching a Halloween mask, Dr. Challis helps the man's daughter investigate his mysterious death.This film is a first rate thriller, and along with the original Halloween, is one of my favorite ""horror"" thriller films. Sure, it doesn't have the typical psycho killer that was so popular in horror films of the 80's, or any of the mass blood and guts. However, the story is original, unlike most of the other horror films of the 80's, and this to me is it's appeal. I'm sure if it was Michael Myer's slashing young children on Halloween night, this film would have scored higher here in ratings. I for one, found this a refreshing change in the series.Sure, maybe I'm biased. I love anything that John Carpenter puts his hands on. I love his musical scores, and his stories. They are all very original. This film is not as bad as people would tend you to believe. Check it out if you are a fan of horror or thrillers, just don't expect the typical slasher film, or you will be disappointed.25 years ago, at the age of 7, this film scared the living hell out of me. Since seeing this film, I never wore a latex Halloween mask again. 25 years later, I still won't.A fun, massively under-rated thriller.7 out of 10.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

AAAAAAAAAAAAAAH! SO SCARY! So without any motivation or reason behind it, we have this evil company turning kid's heads into insects and one doctor trying to stop it.

I think it just gets its bad name cause it was entitled as a Halloween movie and that turns people off because if they are going to watch a Halloween film it better have Michael in it. But, really you can't say Michael is not it because he does make a very brief appearance (watch the movie to see what I mean.)

The movie's set up was okay but from there the story became...well, boring. It wasn't to further the story, because there was no story.

Yes, ALL of them. I've seen them all at one time or another, and I'm still working on tracking them all down again. I found this at a video rental store... who'd have thought?Anyway, I can understand the original concept to do several different movies around a HALLOWEEN theme. NOT a Michael Myers/Laurie Strode/Sam Loomis soap opera. So, going back about 12 or so years when I first saw this, I still recall ""Eight more days till Halloween, Halloween, Halloween...."". It's etched firmly in my mind.So, I found this and watched it again. Many people immediately ask ""What about Michael? What about Laurie?"" If no one can see beyond that, then they are not viewing this movie correctly. No, this isn't a great movie. The Sci-Fi/Android/Computer Chip elements weren't really scary.However, the Druidism/Stone Henge/Mind Control is really creepy. Sure the acting and plot were laughable, but the idea of those creepy weird citizens staring blankly around Santa Mira, the supernatural powers of Stone Henge, the constant Big Brother surveillance.... all of that is much creepier, and much more original than a knife-wielding half-human lunatic chopping people up.I love the Michael Myers story line, don't get me wrong. But, this movie features more creative deaths than stabbing or slashing. There are melted faces, crushing between cars, burning by lasers, drilling through heads, ripping skulls apart, and blowing oneself up. There is the potential of having a good movie, but its turned more into a plain old fun, gore fest.

394,moviesmoviesmovies,Genuinely creepy,7,30 October 2016,"I truly love this film - it's a Halloween classic in the household. Halloween III contains a supernatural element that adds to the creepiness of the usual blood and gore. And it's dolled out slowly and methodically to lure the viewer into the dark world of Silver Shamrock. I was never a fan of the Michael Myers storyline, so I prefer this film over the others - again because of the intellectual darkness of the plot, it's so creepy. It's not just some nut running around with a scalpel or axe, there is serious witchcraft going on here.I put this film in the category of Kubrick's The Shining - where forces beyond our realm are at play. Halloween III lacks the magnificent brilliance of Kubrick's direction, but Tommy Lee Wallace pulls it off well.Dan O'Herlihy portrays one sinister character - his delivery is akin to Bela Lugosi's Dracula - each word carefully chosen and delivered with different meanings. Tom Atkins is believable as a drinker/not the best dad - but he is a caring person and always does his best to do what is right, but somehow things never work as planned. Stacy Nelkins is lovely, but perhaps the weakest link here - I found her relationship to her father a bit uncertain and it is not explained in the film as to why she can switch emotions so quickly. Nonetheless, she is adorable and sympathetic - you want to help her.Again, I love this film. Watch it at night in a dark room ;)thank you",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

The great film critic Gene Siskel actually liked it, although I have to date searched in vain for a print review. Also, it appears that Siskel and Ebert reviewed this movie on their TV show, but an episode of this has yet to turn up anywhere. As proof that Siskel liked it, I went back to the Chicago Tribune archives and located the issue where he listed his 10 best films of 1982. There, in a section he called ""I liked it-you didn't"" he listed Halloween 3:Season of the Witch. I actually agree with him that the movie has merit. It's not really scary and frankly should never have been called Halloween 3:Season of the Witch, since the Halloween killer is absent and I don't recall seeing a single witch. The plot does flow smoothly from beginning to end and does hold ones interest. I also liked the t.v. commercial created by the main bad guy to help enact his plot ""Eight more days 'til Halloween,silver shamrock"".

So Dan and Ellie try to stop him before they're too late.Now why would Cochran want to kill all the kids of America? I don't know. That's the big plot hole in the move. It's never explained and is just weird. Besides that this is a decent horror flick. No it isn't perfect but it kept me interested and I am a fan of the Halloween series. I like the performances. Dan O'Heary is perfectly cast as Conal Cochran and is very creepy. Tom Atkins does a pretty good job as the hero and Stacy Nelkin is pretty good.John Carpenter produces again while Tommy Lee Wallace (the editor of the first Halloween) directs. Wallace does a good job. The way he described the movie is it's like Invasion of the Body Snatchers. And I do see what he means. It's not what you expect it has robots with yellow blood like substance and killer masks. The underground lab where Cochran works with is pretty cheesy. It consists of a few TV monitors on high-tech bookshelves. It also has a mockup of a stone from Stonehenge. I still have no idea what Stonehenge has to do with the movie in the first place.In all a decent B movie with problems but is OK for a movie on a late Friday night when you have nothing to do.2 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars)",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

411,jaargent,Nothing to do with MM,7,8 December 2018,"Yes, this has nothing to do with John Carpenter's original concept. I get people who watch it expecting Michael Myers to appear and slaughter some teens are disappointed. But it does not deserve a 4.something. If you watch it as a standalone story, it's a pretty decent horror story. The concept at the time was to take an original idea and make a film out of it under the ""Halloween"" banner, hoping for a series of films which only had the name in common. I resisted the urge to score it a 10 to bring it's average up, I think a 7 is fair. If you like horror, watch it without relating it to the Myers story, it might not be the best of the series, but it's certainly original and entertaining.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

The clue of the story is told at the end of the movie. Since the acting was quite bad, the reason for all this was not even interesting.Oh well, at least the editing was better than Legion of the Dead. I mean, bad story? OK, no problem.

413,102AFalcon,"Not A Great One, But Accomplishes Rule #1 For A Horror Film",5,13 June 2003,"I've read almost all of the reviews here and honestly, I cannot argue with many of the negative points that are raised here. The movie DOES use the ""Halloween"" name while having only one tiny thread of connection to the Michael Myers movies that came before it and would come later (and that thread, involving a lab technician, can be charitably described as really lame). It is boring in stretches, the idea of Tom Atkins hooking up with Stacey Nelkin is pretty ridiculous, and the plot makes no sense if you think about it for more than 5 seconds.But I don't hate this film. Why? That's very simple. The first rule of a horror film is to scare the viewer and HALLOWEEN III has scared the hell out of me every time I've seen it! It's hard to pinpoint why, exactly, but the atmosphere of the movie is a huge factor. This film is jammed with ominous synthesized music (very 80's touch), cold and sharp-looking camera work, and a feeling of overwhelming dread and fear. It's very hard to establish atmosphere in any movie or TV show; I was talking about this movie with my brother--who said that he didn't think it was scary at all--and I compared it to THE X-FILES. Both that show and this movie were able to quickly drag me into their bizarre and frightening worlds.I don't think I could flat-out recommend a movie with this many huge problems, but I'd say it might scare the viewer, and that's not so bad considering how many abysmal horror movies do nothing else right and cannot get that deceptively simple task completed, either.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

But it was on TV and I had to watch it. I was marvellous. Really interesting and enjoyable to quite a high extent. Lots of gore to get your teeth into and some quite good dialouge. I even found myself with my hands over my eyes. And wasn't because of the bad acting. Tom Atkins, found in films such as Lethal Weapon didn't a great job as our main character and doctor that I thought was a police officer. With his lover a female, looking for revenge on her father killer. The storyline is simple. A Halloween mask company plan to kill thousands of children in the US by placing a microchip in the masks which kill the child and releases bugs and snakes out of the mask. God known how it happens but thats the beauty of cinema. I have heard that this film didn't do great at the Box Office but hay ho. I definitely recommend this film as a watch and don't forget 'This is the night no one comes home!'",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
415,LasPlagas96,Not that bad as everyone says,5,6 November 2018,"Since firstly the Halloween saga was intended to have a different story in each new movie, they let Michael Myers out of the story and came up with a rather interesting plot.
It starts very mysterious and lets you think about whats going on. The lead character starts investigating and wants to find out who is behind the strange murders.
It later leads to a halloween mask manufracturer which is managed by the main villain who's evil plan is to kill all kids by his masks that kill their wearers when a kinda transmission is made via tv on halloween. The villain's role was kinda well played in my opinion.
The villain's henchmen are some kind of androids like from the Alien movies which let me confused if its a science fiction movie or a fantasy movie since the killing mecanism of the masks is some kind of black magic.
During the movie there is a good suspense build up, the acting was ok, but not great. The ending scene where the lead character screamed ""Stop it!"" was the best part. It has surprisingly compared to the other movies a bad ending, meaning the villain wins (posthuman).
After all, I think the concept and idea was great but it wasn't executed well enough. Some times it was a bit exaggerated, and could not been taken serious.
If it were better executed I would have given it a 6 or 7/10",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

There were some nice gore and graphic special effects added to have the film feel more complete though it was shortly edited in the United States the feel still remains.

417,CrimsonKingLives,"Bizarre, twisted, and gruesome sequel",9,5 January 2009,"...and is the last good one in the whole 'Halloween' franchise. Ignore the haters and stay away from the critics as their bias' lean toward the Halloween films before it. This movie is great! The plot completely strays away from the first two films, and gives the series a breath of fresh air, as well as the 80s horror fad. There's no mindless, masked stalker randomly killing people, there aren't any naked teenagers running around having sex, walking backwards into the dark, and checking the basement to turn the lights back on.The movie isn't a masterpiece whatsoever, but it's much more intelligent that most 80s slasher films. The main characters are adults (mostly), Tom Atkins portraying alcoholic Dr. Challis, Stacey Nelkin as Nellie Grimbridge, and Dan O'Herlihy as the villain, Conal Cochran.Very briefly, the plot revolves around a man who is murdered by a strange man in a suit after being checked into the hospital gripping a Silver Shamrock novelties Halloween mask. Dr. Challis seems to find interest in the man's daughter, Ellie, and the two trace the steps of her father back to Santa Mira, New Mexico. It leads them to the Silver Shamrock factory, where he had picked up an order of masks for his store. I won't give anything away passed that...Unlike the previous Halloween installment, this movie's violence is a bit more bizarre and gruesome. The deaths aren't bloody, but sickening and strange. I did see this at the age of 11 and the deaths have stayed with me, so that may be why I'm so disturbed by them, but the violence steers away from the random killings, and hack n'slash of the other Halloween movies.A final note: The movie involves much more of the actual Halloween theme, not just the title. If you haven't seen it at all, give the movie a chance and give it your own opinion, don't just go by everyone else's. The below 4.0 rating is ridiculous.Halloween III: Season of the Witch gets a 7/10 Rated R: Bizarre violence/gore and language",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
418,nexusfpl,"""Weird"" would be an understatement",2,8 September 2017,"Horror franchises are naturally inclined to become stale, obvious and boring after a while, say, after the third or fourth installment, when the formulaic script simply has nowhere else to go. There's no reason whatever to supposed the same wouldn't happen with Halloween. Everybody knows John Carpenter DID NOT want Halloween to become a franchise. But the first two movies made a lot of money, and then they decided they HAD to release a new Michael Myers story every couple of years, if only to satisfy fans of easy and predictable slasher flicks. The third installment in the franchise- Season of the Witch- was a huge departure from the story told in the first two parts- and was also a sign that the real intention was to create a collection of stories based on Halloween, but independent of each other. Of course, it did not succeed, and in the fourth chapter there we went to meet our ""dear"" Michael Myers and his endless thirst for blood again.It was really a pity things went this direction. Because, truth be told, every Halloween sequel was worse than the previous one, with an indestructible killer who simply was a ""seasonal"" variation of Jason Vorhees, and all the writers had to do at a certain point was creating a new excuse for bringing Michael back, because the killer invariably ended ""dead"" or severely injured in each chapter. The rest of the ""plot"" was basically the same in every movie: Halloween night, Michael comes back to Haddonfield, people are sure he's either dead or only a legend, he starts to kill everyone in sight, someone realizes he's alive, there's a relative of his that he's willing to kill, etc, etc.If this third installment in the franchise had been successful, things could have been different. And instead of having THE SAME MOVIE over and over again, we could have now a very interesting collection of good horror stories. Why didn't this work out? My theory is very simple: this didn't work out not only because people wanted Michael Myers back after his hospital bloodbath in Halloween II, but also because Halloween III: Season of the Witch is a very, VERY bad movie. People might have thought: If the other installments in this series be like this one, then we'd rather have Michael Myers coming back every damn year for more of the same.What can I say not to ""spoil"" (sic) the party of anyone else? Well, I will not describe the ""plot"", yet I must say this film does not have any sense whatsoever, bad actors, bad story line, horrible villain, pathetic death scenes, and you end up asking yourself if what you're seeing on screen is really for real. The movie does have a promising beginning, but it all goes downhill from there. I must confess, being a John Carpenter work, the soundtrack is eerie and fantastically atmospheric. Yet the story being told does not deserve a good soundtrack. I think the best way to describe this thing is: bizarre. It's really weird, but not in a positive, Kafka kind of way. It's weird because it doesn't go anywhere and has an awkward story line.I will not give any spoilers, so go and watch for yourself if you haven't yet. I can assure you that you'll understand why the chose to bring Mike back after this ""thing"".",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

I mean the whole scenario of a escaped maniac stalking people with a knife just gets old after a while. Halloween III however, tried to start the series in a more fresh approach. Maybe it does have some silly concepts such as Cochran stealing a five ton monolith from Stonehenge, but it's the movies from heavens sake. I personally believe that this movie is one of the best. The entire story is fresh. It's actually in a way almost good. The whole idea of killing children with Halloween masks is not bad for a movie based on the idea of Halloween. It also features some of the coolest props in all of Hollywood: the masks themselves, which are in very good detail.

Part 3 was on so I decided to sit down and watch it through to the end, and you know what, this is not a bad film. First, it totally screams the 80's which some would see as a negative, but the 80's were'nt so bad, and second, the killings in this movie were so much more brutal then what michael myers handed out (Skulls being pulled apart, heads being ripped off, faces being burnt off and halloween mask eating away at people's faces)<----not bad for a Non-micheal myers movie. Before you rent, buy or view this film, keep an open-mind and realize John carpenter tried something different, if your looking to find Myers in this film, you will be sorely disappointed, but if you want a spooky little tale about halloween mask killing kids and robot men killing people in the most brutal ways, you may just like this film, My rating from 1-10, i give it a 7 for effort and an 9 for being orginal, and a 10 for the cool death scenes;-) all in all, an 8 is is my rate!!!",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

Not a lot of people seem to know that after Halloween II it was supposed to become an anthology but everyone whined about this film not being about Michael Myers so in the end they ended up getting the same movie at least a dozen times. I think the idea was unique, an evil Irish warlock using ancient celtic-irish powers and a stolen Stonehenge to kill anyone who wears the mask, this seems pretty genius to me. Not only the idea is fricken scary, John Carpenter's compositions make the entire movie eerie, a movie doesn't have to be ""good"" to me. Sometimes the atmosphere of the movie is enough to spook me.

Fast forward ten more years and I gave it another shot. Then in my thirties I really enjoyed it! It's a low budget flick, but features pretty decent performances and a terrific synth soundtrack.

The acting at some points is kind of bland. But the story is very well thought out. It ranks last in the series cause it shouldn't have the name Halloween.

427,Nightflyre9,More than a name ...,7,9 October 2001,"In an inexplicable lapse of judgment that has been a Hollywood curiosity for almost twenty years, the producers of ""Halloween"" and ""Halloween II"" decided to attach to their 1982 film ""Season of the Witch"" the prefatory tag ""Halloween III:"".  This was a strange decision, considering the fact that ""Season of the Witch"" shares none of the narrative or exposition from any of the other six films in the ""Halloween"" franchise.  A self-contained movie whose only connection to the series is a fleeting film-within-a-film scene of the original ""Halloween,"" ""Season of the Witch"" is not the only film in the series to lack continuity.  Indeed, if one is to accept the narrative of ""Halloween: H2O,"" then parts four, five, and six must be disregarded, for ""H2O"" picks up after ""Halloween II"" and treats the information in the other films as though it doesn't exist.  If it sounds confusing and somewhat absurd, that's because it is.  The unfortunate by-product of these sloppy creative decisions is that a wonderful movie like ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" has been unfairly vilified because of its ludicrous name.  Fans of the franchise have historically had a difficult time reconciling this film to the others in the series, and it has, over the years, gained a reputation as a ""bad"" movie.  This label, in my opinion, is utterly without merit.  ""Season of the Witch"" is a consistently entertaining movie with believable performances, taut direction, and a nerve-jangling score courtesy of John Carpenter and Alan Howarth.  In this creepy tale, a cyber-age warlock-cum-megalomaniac named Conal Cochran hatches an insane plot to re-create the carnage of the ""Festival of Samhain,"" which consists of turning Halloween night into a coast-to-coast bloodbath.  With an array of lethal technologies at his disposal, the psychotic Cochran (effectively portrayed by the scene-stealing Dan O'Herlihy) seems undeterred by the interference of Dr. Dan Challis and Ellie Grimbridge, the daughter of one of his victims.  Cochran's plan to murder countless innocent children invests the film with a sinister tone that breathes malignant life into the increasingly bizarre plot elements.  Cochran is an engaging villain, pretentious, sadistic, and merciless, and he is a key ingredient of the movie's success--he's one of those cinematic ""baddies"" the audience will instinctively find repulsive. Had the creators fleshed out the unlikely story with a bit more logic and sealed up some plot holes, ""Halloween III"" would have been a much more effective film, but, as it is, it's still one of the better thrillers of the early Eighties, and obviously had loftier creative aspirations than many of its contemporaries.  Also notable are a few graphic murder sequences that were heavily edited for many versions of the film ... and one bizarre scene, in particular, that will send reptile- and insect-haters into convulsions.  ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" is, despite its ill-conceived name, a solid and highly-recommended entry in the canon of horror cinema.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

good concept with the masksvery Halloweeny, constant imagery of the holiday and would be very good to watch around Halloween timesuspenseful, like other Carpenter workslove the setting of the factorythe death scene of that woman was by the chip was very effectiveWhat I Disliked
quite long, the movie was a bit of a chore at times, especially given it feels like a long winded adult version of a Goosebumps episode at timesplot was a bit convoluted, especially the ending with the Stonehenge (whose power is never really elaborated on) seemingly destroying that guy, yet having no effect on anything else reallythe Happy Happy Halloween part was good for like the first 5 times I heard it play, after that it was a bit irritating.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

I think that's it's unfair that Michael Meyers has a monopoly on Halloween. Halloween III was an attempt to take the franchise and make it into a series involving different stories taking place on Halloween night.Now the story of Halloween III isn't that great, but the movie works because it's very creepy. Produced by John Carpenter and Debra Hill, scored by Carpenter, and directing by his protégé Tommy Lee Wallace, Halloween III has the same look and feel of the previous Halloween films.It's sad that this movie didn't work. It was a great idea to take the Halloween films in another direction. I would have loved to see what other stories might have come out it.

431,brainfood-1,The only Halloween film yet that I like besides the original - NO SPOILERS,10,16 July 2009,"I'm not going to read other people's reviews or give a detailed summary. Honestly, horror films with an interesting and original story are rare, very rare. I put this script right up there with ""The Wicker Man."" I'm a lifelong fan of horror, but if there is one thing I have to acknowledge it is that the typical horror film seems to be severely lacking in the imagination department, which to me is unbelievably sad. I can't tell you how many times I've seen ""OMG worst movie ever where is michael meyers!"" type comments on clips from youtube etc. I cannot think of anything more boring that seeing that same stalk and slash crap over and over, and I am absolutely amazed by critics who slammed this movie when it was released, virtually all of whom have since written endless reviews for horror movies decrying a lack of originality or a story. To me, this is the only one in the whole franchise including Zombie's wholly unnecessary remakes that is worth anything at all, besides Carpernter's original.

Although it's directed by Tommy Lee Wallace, he's clearly channeling his inner John Carpenter. The premise is fantastic, the execution is perfect and the ending will stay with you for the rest of your life. In places it's a little cheesy - but this was 1982 people?!?!?

434,Zom-Lassic,Zom Lassic's HALLOWEEN 3: SEASON OF THE WITCH review,8,1 November 2017,"The original idea was let Michael Myers die, and do a different Halloween movie every year, with a different story, this idea obviously failed, because Michael Myers never dies, and people apparently want to keep seeing him killing people and not dying at the same time. But I like Halloween 3: Season Of The Witch, I understand the argument, that it doesn't go with the other Halloween movies, so in my opinion, call it Season Of The Witch, if the the complete title bothers you. This film is pretty scary, the idea itself is probably more scarier than Michael Myers himself. It's not a perfect movie by any means, but it's strong very effective, extremely violent horror movie. The over the top, playing of the silver shamrock commercial can be annoying, but I think that's the point, so when we learn the secret of it later, we can understand the crazy nonstop promotion for it. The one that did really bother me, was making making the 2 leads have sex every moment, I mean isn't that girl supposed to very depressed, over seeing her father's brutally killed corpse, and the point is to find out what happened to him, wow, she really got over that fast, she now just wants to have sex, very unrealistic. But that's really my only problem with this movie. The score is brilliant, the death scenes are extreme, and pretty memorable, and it's definitely not boring at all. Tom Atkins give a strong performance as the doctor who slowly finds out, the true horrifying meaning of the Silver Shamrock commercial, and Dan O'Herlihy is downright evil as the owner of the Silver Shamrock company. Filled with some really creepy moments, and a disturbing, haunting question mark ending, I really have to say, I enjoyed Halloween 3: Season Of The Witch a lot and I highly recommend it.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
435,berkovich-76592,Easily the best of the franchise,7,11 November 2018,"Fans of the movies involving Michael Myers hate it but this is easily as others have stated the best of the Halloween franchise, at least based on the 6 or 7 of the franchise I've seen. There's a real story here, a SF element, beyond the repetition of the other movies which amount to an indestructible being in a white mask going around and killing people. Fine for one movie, maybe two. Carpenter wanted to branch out but the audience didn't move with him, hence Halloween III failed in terms of box office but it's easily the best in the series. So why just a 7? well, the acting/actors are not exactly top notch, and the ending rips off, at least, the 1978 remake of Invasion of The Body Snatchers, but overall a much better viewing experience than watching some mindless, mute guy in a white facemask, who we never really get to know too much about besides Loomis saying repeatedly that he is not human, stiffly walking around killing people.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

437,hucklecat03,"Forget The Title, Enjoy The Movie",10,24 July 2008,"I first want to start off by responding to the previous poster, who decided to ask logical questions about a horror film. Are you seriously trying to analyze horror? It's not meant to be anaylzed. I could ask ""How is it possible that Jason Voorhees, and Michael Myers keep coming back from the dead?"" Nobody watching cares that much to ask such ridiculous questions. They just sit back and watch the film.Anyway, ""Halloween III"" is a tremendous film. Very atmospheric and eerie. It has a haunting, early 80's, synthesized soundtrack, that really adds to the mood of the film.People bash the film simply because of it's title, and the fact that Michael Myers doesn't star in the film. Had this film just been called ""John Carpenter's Season of the Witch"" it probably would've been received a lot better by fans of the franchise.John Carpenter's plan was to have Michael Myers, ""killed off"" in the film ""Halloween II"". After Myers had been killed off, Carpenter was going to take the franchise in a different direction. Sort of a ""Twilight Zone"" type of series of films, rather than a roving, psychopathic stalker. But because of the poor reviews and backlash by fans, due to the absence of Michael Myers, Carpenter gave up on the idea, and thus, Michael Myers returned for another 5 films.I'm not saying this film has the most brilliant plot, or Oscar worthy acting, but it is a VERY entertaining and enjoyable horror film. It captures the true essence of Halloween.Forget the title and give the film a chance.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

Through the efforts of a persistent hero his plan is thwarted--or so it seems.,6,24 October 2006,"""Halloween III"" improves with each watching. Conal Cochran is a broadly-drawn comic villain of the Bond variety. He is grandiose in his perverse ambitions and also a bit of a show-off heading for a comeuppance (no seemingly indestructible Michael Myers he!) A mad toymaker obsessed with gadgetry, he also fancies himself a modern Druid, intent on reviving a pre-modern festival of child sacrifice. Even Stonehenge makes an appearance. Dan O'Herlihy, known for his portrayal of ""lace curtain"" Irishmen, is superb--the viewer can tell he relishes this role, on which he undoubtedly drew on past (non-horror) performances. Bravo! The film has its dark moments but there is something nonetheless tongue-in cheek about the performances. Its victims are largely sales people and their kin. ""Halloween III"" is, after all, a send of of American business' relentless marketing to kids.

But, here is the truth. John Carpenter never wanted Michael Myers to become a series - he hated writing the second 'Halloween' - thought it was a totally useless concept that Michael turns out to be Laurie's uncle. That's why he blew him up at the end - so he didn't have to do the storyline anymore. Instead, he wanted to use the 'Halloween' title to come out with Halloween-themed movies - a new movie with a new them every year.

450,The-aspinall-gamer,Stop with the hate,10,16 August 2016,"People often consider this film the red headed step child of the Halloween Series, when it's not the worst but by far the most creative one of the serious, of course no disrespect to Halloweens 4 through H20.This film is a great film and the main reason people see it is as bad as because they go and see the film and get annoyed because Michael Myers doesn't make a proper appearance (if you're wondering he makes a cameo on a TV in a bar, and his Halloween II actor Dick Warlock has a prominent role in the film), and it's because of this that the film is poorly graded.The series at this point was trying to become an anthology series, and this was a good start I mean trying to distance from a man in a white William Shatner mask trying to kill people, I think an Irish warlock trying to kill kids with Halloween Masks is quite a difference.Tom Atkins delivers a great performance in this film, his character isn't the typical pretty boy, he plays an alcoholic, divorced farther and he has a great arc in which his character goes from a failure as the aforementioned, to having the duty of saving a vast amount of people from Dying.Stacy Nelkin is one of the weaker parts of the story but non the less plays a pivotal role in the story and is in fact the driving force for the most part, at first she appears to not be the Laurie strode stereo-type of gets hunted and is a goody two shoes, she is anything but, in the later part of the film one of the main problems is the fact her character is replaced with a robot duplicate, but we are left puzzled if she was one the entire film or not.Dan O'Herlihy is a true menacing villain and delivers a powerful performance and even though i've seen him in Robocop i prefer him in this as he plays a man who appears to be of a friendly nature but turns out to be a truly evil man, and I believe that this is subliminal messaging that be careful during the Halloween Period.The music by John carpenter is Class A Carpenter the soundtrack is top form and I find myself listening to it over and over again, however the Silver shamrock theme will get stuck in your head and the fact it's played several times throughout the film doesn't help, but the main soundtrack is something that could rival the iconic Halloween Theme.I truly believe this film to be a master piece of 80's horror and is a nice change from what you'd expect to see from this time, I'd recommend giving this film a watch.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

But instead, everyone who wandered into those theatres opening day expecting to see Michael myers and donald pleasence, were so disappointed that they forgot all about the movie that they were seeing and just hated it because they wanted to see michael follow laurie some more, instead of seeing a film about halloween itself. The best performance in this movie though has to come from Dan O'Herlihy as Cochran. If you thought Myers was evil, then you certainly can not even begin to understand the true sinisterness of this bitter man which is Conal Cochran. So if you are looking for a good horror movie, filled with evil and elements of halloween, track this one down, and forget about myers. Because when you compare this to halloween 9 or ressurection, you can easily tell which one is better. Highly recommended.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

I genuinely think it's a decent plot idea for a horror film, again, apart from the silly ending, and there's a good amount of gore. It's not going to win any awards but it's definitely better than it's rating. I also definitely think the main thing bringing it down is that it is part of the Halloween franchise.

467,Lockjaw80,Underrated,8,12 August 2004,"First of all, don´t compare this third installment of the Halloween series with its two predecessors. As a horror movie it stands out entirely on its own. In spite it has nothing in common with part 1 and 2, its very cool. It has a very dark and gloomy mood all the way through, which is filled with tension and a sense of ""what the hell is going on here"". The psychological effect is a bit more present in this one, whereas the graphics in a way are more toned down. Not to say they are totally gone.The scoring is also very unsettling and nervewrecking. It fails a bit towards the end, but it is still well accomplished, having in mind they´ve done such a radical change in the series. Definitly my favourite of all 8 Halloween movies.

Unfortunately, many fans of the HALLOWEEN film series will disregard this film as ""nothing to do with the rest of the Halloween films"", which is true, but that doesn't make this a bad film. When you consider Halloween 5 and 8 - which are very disappointing, this small movie wins hands down. Okay, so this film doesn't have Michael Myers (again not quite so true, as we are reminded of him in the bar room scene where Challis orders a drink), but it has a straight story. You don't need to know the history of the prequel to enjoy this film. If people were to just stop trying to find fault with this film by comparing it to Halloween & Halloween II, then they would see this film is superior (at least to Halloween 2) in almost every way.

471,bluandjewelkiss-46101,The Best in the series,10,27 July 2019,"I was never the biggest fan of the Halloween series. I mainly checked it out because I love watching Cult films and films that are regarded as classics, especially horror films. The first one was fantastic. The second one was okay. But the third? HOLY CRAP WAS I SURPRISED! I've seen SO MANY bad reviews for this movie and they have one thing in common: The ones who hate the film hate it that Michael Myers wasn't in this film as the main antagonist. Well for true fans of the series, did you ignore the laws of physics and think it's totally reasonable and possible that Michael (aka ""The Shape"") was burnt to a crisp in Halloween II? I mean sure horror films do this sort of thing all the time but Halloween did it for a reason.The production crew wanted to take a new approach to the series and make it an Anthology series. Basically every next film, after Halloween II, would take place on Halloween and have a new story to each one. Each story dealing with something different but scary, like the supernatural, or insanity, or witchcraft like this film did. I actually would LOVE to see a franchise go that way. It's a creative concept and this film is the most creative horror film I've seen in a long time. It's not the best but it's definitely in my top 3 most creative films (it's in my top five all time favourite horror films though). This film gave me anxiety and made me want to see what was going to happen next and kept me on the edge of my seat, while the first Halloween, I expected everything because I know every trick in the book about slasher films. I've been watching them for a long time. So a horror film that took a different approach and did it well, with great acting, and a story that you could follow, it's definitely worth the watch.I'd say the scariest part is the ending. Because it almost leaves you on a cliffhanger and you wouldn't know if the protagonist actually wins or not as it cuts out before we find out if this is the case.If you want a horror film that isn't full of cliches and has a creative story that you may/may not have seen before, then this is your film! I love this film with a dying passion, and it's the best one I've seen in the series. Now if only the Michael Myers fans could've kept their mouth shut, we would've probably seen more great, creative Halloween stories.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

I hated them even as a teen when the were all the rage.Just stupid movies filled with blood, screams, and utterly pointless violence.Lots of negative reviews here by fans with little or no imagination..This film was shot on the cheap, and I never thought of that as much of a crime.It has plenty of imagination, a plot, and if you watch closely, there's even some acting.As a bit of an expert of low budget movies, this is a gem.The title may have been a mistake because of the plenitude of mouth-breathing knuckledraggers still trying to figure out decades later where the stabbings are.Then again, my opinion may mean little in a world where Miss Curtis is STILL trying to keep her career alive with tired rewarmed versions of this story in the 20teens.GIVE IT A REST!",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

I am infuriated, insulted, and over-all confused by this movie. Here's the deal: Michael Myers died at the end of Halloween II, but was alive at the beginning of Halloween 4. Also, during the span of time in between the movies, Jamie Curtis had a kid and died, which also went unexplained. You would think Halloween III would explain HOW any of this happened, but this movie failed to do that.Masks that kill people had no correlation for any of the other Halloween movies. Honestly, I didn't watch it. I sat through the first 15 minutes, and having been thoroughly unsatisfied by the story, fast-forwarded straight through to the end. I have no problem with the fact that John Carpenter wanted a different story for the series, but find it insulting that nothing about this movie had ANYTHING to do with the series.I saw Halloween 4 and 5 on AMC when I was 13 and then 1 and 2 during next years horror movie marathon. So, Halloween III was in fact the last one I saw. I thought everything would finally fall into place, that it would all be explained. I felt angry, baffled, hurt, but over-all disappointed.

484,irishninja1980,"I liked it, okay?",8,20 February 2004,"The first time I saw H3, I thought it was okay but I didn't know what the hell to make of it.  Then I borrowed the novel from a friend of mine, that helped me understand the story better, and when I watched it the second time, I actually liked it.  It's got all the classic Carpenter elements: creepy synthesizer score, surprise ending(Ellie turning out to be a robot), just an overall dark atmosphere.  And as for not having anything to do with the first 2 Halloweens, THAT WAS THE POINT!!!  John Carpenter and Debra Hill wanted to make a different movie every year, with a different cast and plot each time, but that each took place on Halloween, which actually wasn't a bad idea.  But unfortunately nobody realized that at the time(and by the way, Carpenter's mistake wasn't putting the ""Halloween"" in the title, it was the ""III"" that misled everybody), so 3 tanked miserably and has been all but put to death by horror fans everywhere, which sucks because it's really not that bad: the witchcraft-meets-technology plot is a nice change from the tired ""psycho killer who can't be stopped"" routine.  Don't get me wrong, I liked H4, and I think it's the last truly great entry in the series.  5 and 6 f***ed it up badly, just like Moustapha Akkad has pretty much done to this entire series.  The whole Michael Myers story has gone just about every way it can(what's next, Halloween 9: Michael Myers runs for Governor of California?).  But back to H3:  if you can actually get over the fact that there's no Michael(except in the commercial for the original ""Halloween"" which plays while Dan Challis is drinking in the bar, and he watches Laurie walk up to the Wallace house while he's tied to a chair.  Advertising one of your own movies within another one of your own movies-very clever!), no Loomis, no Laurie, no ""Halloween"" main theme, and see it for what it is-a unique and pretty f***ing cool piece of work-instead of judging it for what you thought it was ""supposed"" to be, give it a second chance.

Kneale later had his name removed from the credits because he wasn't happy with the way it was turning out. Nevertheless, Kneale's writing shines through in this horror gem. Tom Atkins if fantastic in his best role other than Night of the Creeps. Dan o'Herlihy steals the show as the evil toymaker. It's a film that doesn't take itself too seriously and has excellent art design. Shame they returned back to Michael Myers in no.4. The idea of a different Halloween movie every year sounded great!

Overall it works fairly well and that's why I'm giving it 6/10. The atmosphere and sound is probably the films biggest strength.

But this is by far the worst of them. It doesn't even have anything to do with the movies of Halloween series. The plot was horrible. It has huge holes, no surprises or twists (that aren't painfully obvious), and it is so simple. It's like someone shot a 6 sentence movie in 1 and a half hours: family goes to town, meets weird doctor, strange things start happening around town, turns out doctor is evil, he has evil plan, dad of family tries to stop him...the end? The movie ended in the middle of the climax, so the whole story was unresolved. They should have at least let us know a hint of what would happen after. If they had just filmed one minute more, it would be past the climax, so they could get away with a 20 second resolution to the movie. On top of that, most of what happened in this movie had no possibility of ever occurring. At least most films with magical things like Harry Potter actually seem plausible! I give the plot a 1/10. The acting was horrible all except for the main character. He was in between okay and bad. I give the acting a 1.5/10.The special effects were not so good for an 80's film, I've seen better effects from earlier films from the 60's and 70's. It reminded me of the classic 50's sci-fi films that have spaces with plainly visible strings attached. I give the special effects 2/10.Music, well, there wasn't really much memorable music in the film. I've already forgotten if they used the original Halloween theme (which was only good because it was a classic horror film tune). The repeating string of notes is better than anything that this movie has to offer and this movie doesn't deserve it. I give the music 1/10.Overall the movie was terrible. There really was nothing good about this film. No good acting, plot, music, or special effects. If you're one of those die-hard fans of Halloween, and you want to watch all the movies in the series in order, simply skip this one and move on to the next one, then the next one, then the next one...(sigh).

491,SoenGaudou,I have noting 10 and what is problem ?,10,15 October 2019,"Halloween III: The Sorcerer's Blood is a 1982 horror and SF film directed by Tommy Lee Wallace. So Halloween 3 is not horror, but science fiction.
Tommy Lee Wallace delivers for me an excellent work, so to tell you the truth, Halloween III was a turnip when it came out, by critics because there was no Michael Myers and he doesn't belong to the Halloween saga. And it is considered one of the worst horror sequels of all time (bah I don't know).
HALLOWEEN III IS PART OF THE SAGA FOR ME:
Halloween 3 is part of the saga for me, Halloween doesn't necessarily feature a serial killer, it's connected to a party with masks, candy and Halloween 3 takes the right Halloween codes, because Halloween can be anything, you put a monster it's H alloween, you put killer candy it's Halloween too, it's not just a serial killer. It doesn't matter that Michael Myers isn't here, but it's actually just pretty weird, but why literally the movie just for that, already that people on Allociné are tasteless people.
positive:
Halloween 3 has a lot of good things, especially for its very correct scenario that makes us want to see it and the scenario is neat, with good research and it literally changes context unlike the first two, because Halloween it maybe ""Anything"" is about making several stories linking the Halloween theme. I really like actors, with an endearing, interesting Tom Atkins. The atmosphere is rather successful especially for its music that atmosphere to perfection and not to mention the beautiful original theme composed by John Carpenter and Alan Howarth.
negative:
So this time I attack on the negative. Halloween 3 has quite extensive flaws, because it's a sci-fi movie, and in the SF you have special effects but the special effects are unfortunately not successful, especially for the guy badly camouflaged in his car (and then he burns, it did not related to special effects). There are some flaws in the staging because one moment you had a plan that connected several characters and it was a bit bad. And the title of the film is quite bizarre because in the film we don't see any wizard shrunk, instead we had to call it ""The Season of The Masks"" or ""The Witch season"".
Conclusion:
The Sorcerer's Blood remains for me an excellent entertainment, despite its some rather obvious flaws but do not spoil so many things as a whole.

You were p****d off when you figured out Michael Myers wasn't the antagonist, and you instantly labeled it as crap. It was a shame that they used the ""Halloween"" name in front of what should have been the title ""Season of the Witch"". At this point I will not go over the plot because a lot of you have gone over it already, but a few scenes really intrigued me (especially the scene where the family is put in the testing room).

Drop the ""Halloween III"", and refer to this film only as ""Season of the Witch"" and people would have a different outlook on this film. This is a good sci-fi/horror entry that deserved a better hand than it was dealt.  Hollywood loves a franchise however, and if they didn't release it with ""Halloween"" in the title it would not have got big opening weekend box office.  The last horror sequel that tried such a thing was ""The Final Conflict"" in 1981.  20th Century-Fox is probably kicking themselves for not calling it ""Omen III"". Then again, if they had we'd probably be subjected to ""The Omen: Resurrection"" this summer! ""Season of the Witch"" works as a stand alone film, which all the other sequels to ""Halloween"" cannot claim. John Carpenter took a chance back in 1982.

The story is typically ludicrous and fanciful to the extreme, (the theft of parts of Stonehenge and transportation to Western US for example, and the formation of snakes and insects out of thin air, but then we are talking witchcraft here so fair enough...)

500,profoundlight,One of my favorite Halloween movies of all time!,10,13 December 2020,"I don't get why the movie gets all the hate that it does. The Michael Myers storyline was concluded in Halloween 2 almost perfectly, and the chances this film takes are very brave. It has a creepy atmosphere and interesting world-building, this movie is definitely an underrated classic. The writing is very similar to the second Halloween, and although the writing isn't Oscar-worthy or anything, it is respectable as a Halloween movie script. The whole premise of this movie was executed quite well, and is honestly quite chilling. Goes off in an interesting direction from the first two Halloween films, but I personally enjoyed this direction and am interested in how the films would have been, had they gone the anthology route, instead of choosing to resurrect Michael Myers. This is definitely in my top 4 of my favorite Halloween films, which is my favorite franchise in the horror genre. In conclusion, I hope more people discover this diamond in the rough and appreciate it for the unique direction that it tried to steer the Halloween franchise into.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

How pathetic.So yeah, for those who haven't heard by now, this movie has nothing to do with the ""Halloween"" series aside from unfortunately being given it's name.It should've been called ""Season of the Witch"" and I'm confident it would've been received better, I mean 9 out of 10 of the neg reviews are a complaint about ""no Michael""It's a gem from the time Carpenter and crew were at their best and I urge people not to miss out on this great film simply because of the title.To the people still complaining about the deviation, my goodness, get a hobby.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

Yes the original is V.Good and I have seen the whole series now and Halloween III is abysmal!b Why make a film that has nothing to do with the series?

There seems to be two and only two opinions of it: ""I love it,"" or ""an embarrassment to the Halloween franchise."" It was the latter after the first time i viewed it. Was really taken back to see Michael absent because I was not aware of this at the time. I think to enjoy it, you really need to watch it as its own movie. I did this today and did enjoy it more this time. But I think I just formed a third opinion. It was just OK lol.

Shame on the director for kicking out the main character of the movies. Not only did Michael Myers not play a part in this production but had nothing to do with the story line. The idea of robots in a Halloween movie and a horror movie is just sad. Especially in the bit where he is tied to a chair and then with is hands tied up he manages to find a way to hurl a mask about 3 metres through the air and get it precisely on the camera is just rigged. Hopefully they do not make a remake of it like they did with the original because that will be even worse.

That doesn't have to be because it's a hard hitting, thought provoking piece of cinematic magic. It could be because the viewer is able to switch off their mind for an hour and a half and just enjoy the spectacle put in front of them.Halloween 3 is the latter. Of course its inferior to the classic original and the very impressive sequel. However this is the 3rd film in a franchise and they take the ballse move to base it on a completely different story!The acting is quite good, the story is ridiculous however entertaining.

514,yolkie,not GREAT but not bad,6,21 August 2005,"I'm a long time reader of this site and I decided to use this film as my first review. I intend to review all the Halloween films, excluding the first two.I thought it better to use this as a starting point rather than the first couple as I don't really think I could add a review to this site that isn't the same as another.Anyway, enough with the history lesson.I was a fan of the Halloween films and about 7 years ago I began to really get into them, at the age of 17. I think I first saw Halloween 3 : season of the witch when I was around 13 years old. I hated it, I didn't get it, and like most of the reviewers here I was confused as to why Michael Myers wasn't present.After doing a little research I discovered that John Carpenter had apparently written several Halloween scripts that were all stand alone. Halloween 2 was made after Carpenter bowed under the intense pressure to make a sequel. He wanted to kill Michael Myers once and for all. Unfortunately I think Halloween 2 was a major reason as to why Halloween 3 has been panned and regarded as a ""failure"".A couple of years ago, when I decided to watch this film again, I was pleasantly surprised. I took it at face value, appreciated it for what it is.I won't give a synopsis - virtually every other review does. What I will do is evaluate the story. Although I found the plot interesting and it's certainly well made and directed, there are a couple of glaring continuity errors that you will pick up almost immediately. They don't particularly detract from the story but it takes away a little credibility - as does the commercial for Halloween playing in a bar - what's that about?! O'Herlihy plays a brilliant villain in this film, very creepy. The ending is quite unexpected and there are effects that are quite squeamish. The music used is also very good - yes, the music is annoying, but I think it adds something to the film - when you think the commercial was used to attract children and we all know how annoying those commercials can be, I think this fundamental part of the storyline transports it from era to era.It won't be the best horror film you ever see, but it's enough to keep you interested and just a little scared.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

Maybe it's the theme. There's nothing really supernatural here. No aliens, giant bugs, monsters, or slashers which can't be killed. No, it's just good old fashioned man's inhumanity to man, complete with ever present surveillance cameras and robotic secret police. And it isn't the gods/G-d/Allah, no just their agent. Just Al Quaida, the Taliban, Hezbollah, or the Nazis. As a realistically chilling Cochran, pinch hitting for Osama or Adolph, observes, 'It isn't we who decide. No. It's the planets who do.' And, although Cochran is destroyed, just as in real life, the third commercial stays on. Everyone doesn't die, at least not yet. The planes only hit two tall buildings and kill thousands. All Jews don't go to the gas chambers, just six million. And all the kids don't turn into masses of crickets, only the ones with Silver Shamrock masks who turn to the third channel for the big giveaway, eager as are the people with their fake bars of soap for their showers. Cochran is just doing his gods' work, just like Osama, and just like Adolph for his racially pure state. He doesn't care about future profits ('they won't let me order for next year, they know I like to work ahead'), just as Iran doesn't worry about annihilating its customers, and Germany regarded murdering Jews as a higher priority than winning a war. Like Goering laughing at Nuremberg, 'It's a joke on the children,' beams Cochran.

This film tries something different and it pays off for those of us who like horror films and not just popular images repeated ad nauseum. Who cares if this isn't about Myers? Didn't the latter films prove that we never needed any more than the first film and maaaaybe the second to close the entire arc of the franchise neatly? Add to that the somewhat clever premise that none too subtly casts the Myers archetype as a business exec, mirroring Carpenter and Co's frustration with having to continue to pump out these films in a silly and fun way and I think Halloween III is an incredibly impressive third outing for a series that had no right to be this good for this long.

You can then watch it and be able to enjoy it for what it is, not hate it for what it isn't. Yes, it's true that Michael Myers, AKA The Shape, has nothing to do with this film. There's no connection to the other films at all, in fact. But erase these expectations and what you'll get is a very strange, rather surreal little film that actually does offer something unique and slightly spooky in its own way. John Carpenter is a genius when it comes to making simple music for his films, and what he dishes up in this one will stick in your mind for a long, long time. You'll find yourself singing the Silver Shamrock jingle at least once every Halloween for years to come, trust me.

So they wanted to give this a try. and maybe if the movie was better they could have made a TV SERIES called Halloween and left the movies alone.

But their plan is discovered by Dan Challis and Ellie Grimbridge and they try to stop him in which they succeed and that is about it and just a lot of gore scenes thrown in.

Dr. Dan Challis stumbles upon a shocking plan involving witchcraft and the country's most sought after item by Silver Shamrock Novelties. When Harry Grimbridge is brutally murdered by a mysterious man who then takes his own life, his daughter and Challis go investigate. They find themselves in Santa Mira, CA where they are trying to find out why the killed occurred. There they meet Conal Cochran, owner of Silver Shamrock Novelties, with a warm smile and courteous manners. Cochran's factory has manufactured millions of masks across the country, but they have deadly chips that will cause destruction on Halloween night, and millions and millions will die to an evil plot. Led by suspense, an excellent soundtrack, a fiendish premise, and much more, Halloween III might actually surprise you in terms of what it has to offer. The idea was to make a new Halloween movie every year with a different storyline each time, but HIII failed at the box office because people wanted Michael Myers. The failed to realize that other things besides Michael Myers can cause terror on Halloween night. The series is called ""Halloween"", not ""Michael Myers"", and this untraditional sequel is proof.

He also did destructive stunts as the shape from halloween and the undead in ""The Fog""From the music, premise, Tom Atkins and the ending.Stellar horror movie that I'm happy to have in my Blu Ray collection.If you've never seen this movie and you love horror 80's B Movie classics, what are you waiting for.Probably my favourite John Carpenter & Alan Howarth score.

Another reviewer nailed it when they described how atmospheric and creepy this film is. The plot is ridiculous, and the acting is quite cheesy at times but the overall story is quite unique, still, to this day and with that accompanying the awesome score created by Carpenter helps make this one worth watching yearly. It really is great to see Tom Atkins in a starring role, and Stacy Nelkin is quite hot and well worth looking at. I guess the main reason I love this unique film is the outrageous plotting, reminding me of the villains that often show up in Bond films, Cochran is one demented goon hell bent on destroying the world. The saddest thing is the title of the film though, they really, really should have just titled it Season of the Witch and called it a day. Instead, everyone who saw it was angered at having no Meyers and that killed the great idea Carpenter had for making something unique every year, centered around the holiday of good Ole Samhain. So, to this day, people still hate on the film for not having little Mikey in it, and I cant blame them, as for years I was there with them. But after having learned about Carpenter's plans for a yearly Halloween themed film, and seeing it again with new eyes open, it made quite the difference and changed my overall opinion of a true cult classic.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
540,thaboogyman,what were they thinking not putting michael in this? still okay though.,4,11 June 2006,"The only reason i give this movie 5 stars is because if it weren't for the other 7 halloweens it would be a pretty good horror movie. However, due to the other 7 halloweens this movie is nothing but a lost cause and a hole in the Halloween series. Halloween III has absolutely nothing to do with the other 7 films and most people don't even consider it as a part of the series, including myself. When I watch the series I skip this film. All in all probably worth seeing, again not a terrible movie but just kind of ruins the Halloween series so if your looking for something to watch and you are not interested in watching the entire Halloween series you might as well check it out because it's got a pretty good story and an eery atmosphere.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
541,chaosmongers,Atmospheric and Evil,9,7 January 2005,"This is one of my all-time favourite movies.It has a great (if slightly unbelievable) storyline involving halloween masks that react to certain television signals, causing the wearer to .. let's say ... have a bit of a hard time.It's wonderfully done parts include the real feeling of atmosphere, paranoia and isolation of being in a strange place (in this case, the Irish company town, where the masks are made). Where everyone is connected with the company, and knows it's secrets, and where curfews are in place to keep everyone in order at night.Fantastically directed and acted.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
542,plaingrove,Its got all the John Carpenter elements,7,6 October 2015,"I'm not going to give a summary of this film you can wiki it or watch a trailer or read a summary from half the reviews. I don't even feel like writing what I liked about the film. If you like horror from the 70's and 80's and John Carpenter films you should enjoy this. If your complaint is ""but there's no Michael Myers in a Halloween movie"" true they should have titled it differently. The main problem everyone has with this is they don't know the history of the Halloween franchise. Originally it was supposed to be a different story with different characters every time still under the Halloween title because each film was to focus on the macabre holiday. You know how each season of American Horror Story is a different story with a different sub title, well that's what this was to be. Unfortunately they wanted to close out the open end of H1 so they made part 2 about Mike just to kill him. Everybody loved the Myers character so much they wanted him in every Halloween no matter how many low grade dumb sequels were produced. I for one wish they would have gone with plan A. We could have had a half dozen more Carpenter horror films from the best era in the genre.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

549,stevepwood,I can't believe I watched the whole thing....,1,24 October 2006,"In what easily has to rank as one of the worst sequels of all time (see The Exorcist II or Caddyshack II), the departure from the storyline of its predecessors could have been refreshing. Instead, it was an exercise in the absurd and unbearable. A mad scientist toy maker is going to kill all children on Halloween with a sophisticated plot involving Halloween masks and a diabolical television commercial. Why? I'm not sure. You get sexual tension (and eventually release) between an attractive young girl (who is ""older than she looks"" when asked (in bed) how old she is)and a crusty middle-aged man....absurd. This is an awful movie which I would avoid at all costs. For horror fans, there is no gore - only mildly disturbing death scenes. It certainly didn't deserve the name Halloween and I can understand why John Carpenter and Debra Hill bailed on the franchise after this one - they should have pulled the plug on this one first.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

The worst part was the whole "" THREE MORE DAYS TILL HALLOWEEN HALLOWEEN ThREE MORE DAYS TILL HALLOWEEN HALLOWEEN SILVER SHAMROCK"" god turn that crap off. so check it out on how bad it is. Another spoiler was that the whole robotic thing was so freaking lame. i mean near the end the Atkins (main character) punches right through this one guys stomach what the hell is that! At the end there was no point in making him kill his girlfriend 4 times.

I think if this film was released just as Season of the Witch maybe it would have fared better. With it being Halloween three I think fans felt slighted. I just watched the film and loved it. I get what they were going for. It's a really moody, well shot film. Love the creepy score and cinematography. It would have been interesting to see where the franchise went if the continued the anthology approach. The film is also tonally really dark. I hope maybe people will give it a chance and as a stand alone film. I really enjoyed it.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
552,joeaffmd,"A brilliant, sinister dark film; flawless",10,5 February 2020,"I see so many negative reviews of this movie I had to chime in.The third movie in the Halloween series was always the one that fooled us kids back when we rented movies at our local video store even before Blockbuster existed. Was Michael Myers in the movie? ""No he wasn't, so the movie sucked!"" Damn we should have rented another Jason or Michael Myers movie when they stab the young lovers having pre-marital sex!Fast forward years later to our adulthood and the movie takes on a completely different light. As a parent one is drawn in by the complete evil this company is willing to unleash on millions of innocent Children. But are they really that innocent? As in Cochran speech he seems to allude to the fact that dressing up and asking for candy invites all the evils of the true origin of Halloween on to them. As citizens in society, we are left questioning how far one man could go to use a consumer product to kill millions of unsuspecting people? This is not a ""slasher"" movie. Characters are not hunted down by a madman to die on screen - unless they are witnesses to the Silver Shamrock plot and must be silenced to protect it. This movie takes us behind the dark origins of Halloween with a brilliant performance by Dan O'Herlihy as Conal Cochran. Time and Time again as I watch this movie I left intrigued, from the moment he meets Dr. Chalis and Miss Grimbridge in front of the hotel when the ""misfire"" occurs to the unsettling scene with the old lady knitting when Mr. Cochran reveals he knows Dr. Chalis is there to expose his mask plot. This movie works and is an absolute TIMELESS masterpiece because of the excellent performances, the timing of the plot and again Dan O'Herlihy's performance. When Dr. Chalis finally sees the room with the piece of Stonehenge in ""Final Processing"" area of the factory the scope, completeness and reach of the Silver Shamrock organization is revealed. This mask operation makes us question the power companies wield over the lives of children and adults from mass opinion, to marketing to the safety of our products. A viewer looking for more than a ""slasher film"" can be captured by the technical underpinnings of this mask? and how the commercial can ""activate"" the masks? The Kupfer family's performance in Test Room A when little Billy tries on the Mask that Cochran wanted him to have is so dark and so abrupt it could not have been done any better. The look of disdain on Cohran's face for his own best salesman is complete. The end of their lives are just a trial run of how so many millions will end up if the plot is successful.This is an absolute masterpiece from start to finish in an era when life was simple for most people yet technology existed behind the scenes. We are left never knowing how Halloween night ended for millions of Children.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

Yes this movie has nothing to due with Michael Myers... or Halloween 1 & 2 ... so sure that gives you every right to be disappointed. However as a movie ... It is great! There is nothing to dislike about this movie. It's an original and yes I think it was stupid of them to put the title Halloween 3 on it considering it has nothing to due with the previous to... but like I said as its own movie it is definitely worth watching and owning!!! I even had to special order it because no one carry's it. The song they repeatably play in this movie will have you singing it for days after you watch it. All I can say is if you a fan of Horror movie this is a must buy. It reminds me a lot of the movie ""They Live"" something about the way it was shot I think. Personally I do think they need to change the name of this movie though... Maybe to Silver Shamrock, they seems fitting.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
555,voorhees_72,Watch Faithfully Every Halloween,8,9 October 2006,"I think its interesting that the creators of this movie probably thought this would be guaranteed an instant hit with the fan base created by the first two Halloweens. Instead, it created a lot of resentment that it was labeled as the third installment in the Halloween franchise, due to the fact that there is nothing in common with the first two aside from the calendar date. Call me crazy, but I enjoyed this movie.I saw it at a time in my life where I was angered by the strict policies of my parents, and seeing any type of horror movie whatsoever was almost impossible. I had seen very few horror movies aside from what I could sneakily stay up late and watch on local networks. This was circa 1987, and I lived amongst a network of school friends who also loved horror movies, but only within the scope of Freddy and Jason. For some reason, there wasn't much buzz about the Halloween series at my school, until part IV came out in '88. In fact, I had never even heard of Michael Myers prior to watching III. Then one day I was able to get my hands on a VHS copy of Halloween III through a friend and I was thrilled that I would be able to see it. I would have preferred and intended to see all the Halloweens in order, but it just so happened by chance that I would watch this one first. So not having seen the first two Halloweens...you can imagine how I could watch this with a totally unbiased opinion. I was glad that I was able to see this prior to the first two, because it gave me a perspective on it that most people did not get. I wasn't upset that Michael wasn't in it because I didn't know who he was. Its a fun film that gives me a nice spooky autumn vibe. I had always had a fascination with the holiday, and every year, I made it a tradition to watch this along with the rest of the series. I had eventually seen the rest of the Halloween series, and grew to appreciate the Myers films too. I like 'em all...but not past the first Four. Part V through Part whatever are pure garbage. so Im on board with Part Three!! Get ready kids!!!",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
556,elardo138,A film that proves to be more memorable than many of the Halloween sequels.,10,10 November 2006,"I think this is a very unique movie, which is something rare in horror these days. Basically it's about a man named Conal Cochran who wants to make the largest sacrifice to the Pagan gods in history. He first makes a name for himself selling children's novelties and masks. Eventually his products are in the homes of most children, and he becomes a household name. He then uses fragments of Stonehenge and devises a series of masks to house these pieces. He also develops a commercial which creates a specific effect to act with the pieces of Stonehenge. These masks are trendy and popular with kids, and they are promised a surprise on Halloween night if they tune their televisions in at a specific time. Of course this final commercial is what enacts the pieces, causing a very nasty death to whoever is wearing a mask.So basically, if the children watch this commercial on Halloween Night they will be sacrificed to these gods on Samhain. There are two main protagonists who wander into Cochran's town, which is completely controlled by him, as they investigate strange deaths and disappearances. The few people who remain in his town are monitored 24/7 and must adhere to his set curfew. The other inhabitants are creations of Cochran. They patrol the streets at night and kill anyone who causes disruptions to their creator's plan.So with all that, you have a strange plot for what I feel to be a memorable horror film.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

I like Myers but he has been overdone and he is an example for the reason why no one comes up with anything new anymore. The majority of horror movies now are remakes and for people to just continue to promote this garbage by going to the theater to watch this unoriginal crap is repulsive. New horror sucks just like the majority of the entertainment field because everyone is so unoriginal. Anyhow, this is an example of one of the lost gems in horror.

Our hero is a slightly flawed character, womaniser and boozer, but an honest sort of guy. The idea of filming at a mask factory is inspired - all those creepy faces!

If they called themselves a real fan of the Halloween films you should realise that Carpenter,Wallace and Hill made the first three films.They wanted to end the Myers storyline after part 2.Halloween 3 was the start of what would have been a yearly saga of films based on the halloween season,along the lines of the Twighlight Zone.Tragically that idea was quashed,the main reason for this was Universial advertisement of the film,which didnt state that H3 was'nt a direct sequal.Combine that with the over reaction of the audiences and it floped.What a shame,we will never know what other stories Carpenter and co had up their sleeves.If it was as good as this one then we were in for some great films. If you not seen this film i highly recommend it brace yourselves for two shocking scenes that you wont be ready for.Stylishly made with a  creepy but excellent performance by Dan o'Herlihy.A good performance by Tom Atkins also.

Vampires, Mummies, Ghosts. It remains one of my favorite Halloween and Horror movies of all time.

In this case we hear ethereal synths ala Witness and commodore 64 sounding syncopated rhythms that modern producers completely overlook.

Michael myers isn't even in it.,2,21 September 2011,"When I saw 'Halloween 3' on the shelves in a video store (yes, back before DVD came out) I hurriedly grabbed it and rented it. That night I watched it and have never been so disappointed in my life with a film. Okay, the film is mediocre. At best. I wouldn't go so far as to say 'Omigawsh, it was absolutely amazing, stop bashing on it' like some of the morons have written in here, because the acting was absolute rubbish. What I am most angry about is the fact that the title says 'Halloween 3'. Normally, in sequels, it's a continuation on from 1 or 2, right? I feel the producers/directors of Halloween made a rubbish movie, thought 'Uh- oh...what are we gonna do now? I know, let's slap on the title of Halloween 3 to lure in unsuspecting people into watching this garbage. I believe the movie is titled wrong, and should simple be called 'Season of the Witch' and leave it at that, and totally just take the title of 'Halloween 3' away from it, because it has NOTHING to do with Michael Myers AT ALL.

584,nineinone2001,Forgotten Classic,9,8 December 2006,"It's so interesting that so many years later and people STILL just don't get this movie; what people seemingly don't like about this movie are actually what make it a lost classic.It's supremely sinister; goes out of its way to knock big brother, commercialism, and, of course, hurt poor little children. Oh, and no Mike Myers? No wonder y'all hated it; its dark, dangerous AND intelligent, as opposed to a typical slasher which doesn't ever hurt the innocent, or attack ""big"" ideas like consumerism or the true meaning of Halloween.First off, not including Mike Myers was a gutsy move, and, dare I say, a great one. How many other franchises have had the GUTS to do that? The series was already played out by Halloween 2. With every other franchise nowadays doing hackneyed sequels to death, why are people so nuts at having ""every"" sequel be the exact same thing? I, for one, am all about ""reinventing"" series, much like Battlestar Gallactica has recently done. Even better, this is a sequel bold enough to admit its OWN clichés, where the original Halloween movie is playing as the movie of the week IN the sequel itself. Ingenious.I guess it goes to show that most people prefer Friday the 13th over something like the Twilight Zone, with intelligent commentary on modern day society.The ""joke"" in this movie is quite literally ON the children (and only them), ie in killing millions of them... and then anticipating the reaction of their parents as they see them die. Now that's downright sinister, if not sadistic.So too is the creepy corporate town where big brother watches all, or in the killer robots who happily immolate themselves when the mission is accomplished. This film is in some ways more disturbing and intelligent than the crazed single slasher film, and probably more about Halloween's true origins dare I say, where the little children did probably get sacrificed. The irony here of course, that Cochran uses the corporate system against itself, to resurrect the ""true spirit"" of Christmas... -LOL, I mean Halloween. And, of course, the greater irony that the TV is his ultimate weapon... Baudrillard could have a field day with that one.The real ""robots"" are those that just follow orders, or, em,... expect every sequel to be another predictable slasher movie.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

588,rowtondanny,Underrated - Watch for yourself,8,6 November 2012,"***WARNING contains spoilers*** Unlike most, I absolutely get this film. Sure, its dated, but I think in a cool way - with its dark brooding 80s synth soundtrack, deliberately cheesy kids TV ad running through the film and plot that has a touch of the 50s, 60s / Twilight Zone / paranoia about it. Of course the special effects are the first thing to date on a film too and this one is no exception, but there's something about the cold calculated mission of the robots working for Conal Cochran (played very well by Dan O'Herlihy) that negate the downside of this part of the film. The fact that the bad guys are not human (though appear to be) allows greater artistic license, I feel. Having said that, the dated look of men in white coats standing at banks of huge computers with flashing lights is of course clichéd. As is the prospect of a man rescuing the girl who has been detained for experiments and questioning. This was hardly fresh ground, even in 1982. I do like the totally different context to the series of films that this sequel undertakes. Kind of like a bigger, more formidable evil than the solitary psycho Michael Myers with much deeper, far reaching consequences to society. I watched the film last week for the first time in many years, almost bracing myself in expectation of its ability to entertain and unnerve to have dwindled significantly. However, I actually found it had a bigger impact on me than before (when I was probably a teenager). I'm not going to bore you with the synopsis which you can read anywhere but I would encourage fans of old school horror to give this much maligned film a chance. To me, it is highly underrated and its a shame as I think when it came out I would have thought people just lazily expected another slasher flick and, at that, an improvement on the disappointing continuation of 'Halloween' with the first sequel.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

Halloween II ended with Michael Myers burnt to a crisp, after all, so why continue that storyline? Carpenter and Hill liked the idea of a horror film series centered on the idea of Halloween but having story lines independent of each other. Thus, Halloween III: Season of the Witch was born. Audiences must have felt perplexed and deceived by this in-name-only sequel and the result was an interesting, albeit brief, experiment in taking the series in a new direction. Michael Myers would return to the series 6 years later with the aptly titled, Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers but the wounds from Season of the Witch still haven't healed even though my opinion is that it's a fun and unfairly maligned film.read more at: http://idler-mag.com/2010/10/08/the-witching-hour-and-38-minutes/",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

I realise there is a tiny screening of Halloween on a television screen at the beginning, but God please, the only thing remotely in common with this film was that it contained a pumpkin mask.

The premise is simpy fun, original, intriguing enough. It's entertaining from beginning to end, and it's well made (in 80's way of making, of course). Maybe it was not a good idea for John Carpenter and Debra Hill to include this one with a totally different story in their cliché-ridden slasher franchise. Anyway, horror and science fiction fans with an adquired taste can be surprised (and relieved) when they realize that this is not the another lame tale of mechanical inmortal killers, idiotic teenagers doing stupid and boring things for the 70% of the running time, that for a change this one is really a movie closer to that endearing, clever pulp fictions of the 50s and the TV series of the 60s.

This is normally evidenced by the fact that they give Halloween II five stars. Anyway, Halloween III: Season of the witch is a fantastic movie, the best of the series.

I have listened to that soundtrack for years. Has some great music, and is a great compliment to the music from Halloween 1 and 2. Probably some of the best scary movie music, or scary music ever made. My favorite parts of the movie are the music and Stacey Nelkin. She couldn't act to save her life, but damn she is sexy. Cut! Cut! Cut! Lose the shower door in the bathroom scene, and this movie would be a 10 all day in my book!! The love scene is good, but get rid of him, don't need someone else there, just her in the bed would have been fine. I'm sure Carpenter has some cutting room ""scenes"" not included in the movie, sitting in his personal collection.

The stern villain reveals his secrets expecting the hero to die; aside from Tom Atkins, the roles are merely plot vehicles. The movie quickly develops into a protracted good versus bad struggle followed by a race to convince a disbelieving public seen in countless movies before it.Silver Shamrock- the ostensible if not the real ""Other"" in this horror - is the occultist toy factory with Irish roots, now lodged in the tight-lipped Californian community of Santa Mira. 80s California is a stereotypical place of self-aggrandizing wackos with a rather loose hold on reality - ""this place is a zoo!"", exclaims Dr. Challis. But more than that it is a statement against nascent corporate media-controlled America. The ultimate struggle for Challis is not the factory itself but its reach into the homes of America and the hearts and minds of the children it seeks to destroy....The soundtrack is just great - dark organ synth sounds and that mesmerizing jingo.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
600,peterkarlsson79,THIS is the second Halloween,10,16 December 2019,"I remember: I had seen the original ""Halloween"", number two and four, but NOT the third one. It was not in the rental video store, I remember. Some years later our town got a second rental video store and THERE I find this film. It had the Swedish under title ""Natten, då INGEN kom tillbaka"" which means: ""The night no one got back"", and this was a hint about that Michael Myers was out of it, but I did not get it back then.
I will confess I was a little bit confused in the beginning. A chased man and the chaser were some men in black suits...Okay. Later I see Michael Myers in the commercial for the television. Alright, he got killed in the second film... got burned to death and before that shot several times... he really is dead. And in this film, he only is a cinema-product. Alright I'm willing to buy that. What is this story then...?And my GOD! I guess this was the first flick which really, really scared me. I was shocked, I remember, Almost eighteen and afraid like a little baby. I still, this day, think this is the scariest film I ever seen. The scene in the test room, that enchanting beat from the television set, the stone-cold look on Conrad Cochran's face and the mothers laugh which stops when she realizing what's going on....The film after that is survival with suspense and a race against the clock with a brilliance which I only have seen in Hitchcock's movies before. And the ending... Yes, make your own choice: Did he or did he not. Yes, many people HATE this movie, but I think this is the best of the series. The first ""Halloween"" was copied by others, still is, but this film is so special that no one dared to try.
I was reading the facts about ""The Season of the witch"" and realized John Carpenter wanted to do a new story in each sequel with the Halloween-season as a theme, and this should had been part two. Maybe if this film had been the FIRST one in the series the response from the fans had been better. Just a thought.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
601,wearblackreadcamus,*Classic Halloween Movie*,10,3 October 2020,"Halloween III is often discounted due to the film's title, which seemingly tricks the viewer into expecting supernatural slayer Michael Myers to show up and add to his ever growing body count. This movie is an autonomous flick, and if you watch it as such, you're in for a treat. There exists a whole subgenre of pretty bad yet oh so good horror films, of which this one, in my opinion, stands at top tier. The Silver Shamrock jingle has become part of my quintessential ""it isn't really Halloween until I see or hear this"" ouvre.
The soundtrack is pretty much the only thing that bears any resemblance to John Carpenter's style; very electronic. The story is laughable but laudable.

It is hated for many reasons but the main reason that a lot of people is that it'a missing everyone's favorite William Shatner mask wearing maniac Michael Myers. I used to be one of those people. I use to hate this movie not just because Michael Myers wasn't in it... but I thought it was boring. I was pretty young back then and the horror fan was quickly starting to develop in me. It's been years since I watched it, but when I was hanging out with my aunt and uncle I wanted to watch it just to see if I can get a new opinion out of it I was at least hoping that it would either by okay or good. But I was worried that it would suck hard like Halloween 5, 6, and Resurrection. I watched it and while I do have some problems, the film isn't as bad as everyone says it is. It's not the best in the franchise but I thought it was okay. Not great but okay. I think it probably deserves another watch if anyone watched it and hated it the first time. It's at least better than Halloween 5, 6, Resurrection and the Rob Zombie remakes. Good: The acting is really good in the movie. All the actors did a good job with the material they were given. There are some really creepy moments in the movie. The watch the magic pumpkin scene left me disturbed and scared, and there are other moments that are creepy. The villain Conal Cochran is also a good villain and is plan is awesome. I won't say what it is but It's one of the strong points of the movie. Bad: Here are some of the problems I had with it. The romance between our male and female lead feels very forced and they didn't give anytime in the movie to build it up. Also, while the silver shamrock theme is catchy, we do here it a million times and it does get annoying after a while. It's still stuck in my head as I'm typing this review. Another thing that bothers me well sorta. The film score, it's just too techno and repetitive especially the music in the opening scene. Especially because it was done by John Carpenter. It's not as awesome as the music from the original film.Final Verdict: In the end the film isn't terrible as everyone says it is. It may not be anything special but It's at least okay. It's better than the other crappy sequels to come out in the future (expect Halloween 4 that movie was awesome. It has good acting, good scares and a good villain.

603,gbrode,My favorite horror film,10,28 July 2020,"I love this movie.It's a bizarre yet creative horror film that's severely overlooked. Sure it has flaws but I love it.First off the story, again it's wildly creative. Compared to the first two Halloween films & how simple they are, this film is insane. Witchcraft sacrifices meets technology on Halloween? Who thought that would work? I think this film pulls it off. It deserves more credit especially with this crazy story.Conan Cochran, played by Dan O'Herlihy, is one of my all time favorite villains. He's a charismatic businessman, a genius inventor, & a psychotic old witch. He's charming & terrifying. O'Herlihy is the best actor in the film & the best character in my opinion. He's plays the role perfectly & he kills every scene he's in.The score is one of my all time favorite scores. It's no surprise that John Carpenter & Alan Howarth made a beautiful score. They always kill it. The score really elevates this film to a whole other level. I listen to it every fall season & it puts me in the Halloween spirit like no other piece of music. 10/10 for the score.This film, like the score, is the perfect film that puts me in the Halloween spirit. The eerie dred & atmosphere in the film perfectly captures the feeling of Halloween. It's perfect honestly.I love how the film is unconventional and it doesn't have a happy ending. In fact the ending puts a chill down my spine every time I watch it. The film is so dark & it leaves such a disturbing feeling.This film was supposed to be the starting point for the anthology series. Carpenter & Hill came up with the idea since Michael Myers died at the end of part II & they didn't wanna continue that storyline. To this day it's the biggest missed opportunity in cinematic history that the studio didn't stick with the anthology series. Imagine all the possibilities & creative films based on the holiday of Halloween. It's a damn shame. I wish we got to see what else Carpenter & company would've came up with. Unfortunately we got mediocre to god awful sequels involving Michael Myers.Sure this film isn't perfect. There are some flaws. The timeline is inconsistent, some of the acting isn't good, & there's some cheesy dialogue & moments. It doesn't bother me because I have a blast watching this film.All in all, this is my favorite horror film of all time.10/10",Halloween III - Season of the Witch

611,jamesnh,Appreciation Takes Time,8,8 August 2017,"I am pleasantly surprised how good this film is. Based on the reviews, it clearly is a controversial film in the Halloween series, but if you can get passed the expectations of a Serial Killer theme and would like to enjoy a good horror movie give this one a chance. I personal enjoy allot of elements from this film. For example, Jon Carpenter Music is fantastic. From the first to last scene he creates a wonderful focused and hollow mood. Carpenters music is a critical component of the original Halloween movie and luckily he gave Witch a great soundtrack. Clearly it's much more new wavy electronic, but it offers a certain quality and style that only Carpenter has. That slowly luring you into the screen and then grab you by throat for a ride style gives the film a big boost. Another element that I enjoyed was that the story brings in a little bit of the historical aspects of the Halloween Holiday. The fact that Halloween itself originates from Ireland and what some Irish did is a main theme of the film. If you understand the history you will have a better understanding and appreciation from the writers perspective in my opinion. Otherwise you won't know whats going on in some cases. Wikipedia it or watch the History Channel History of Halloween first 10 minutes and you will have enough info to get by.A couple of areas where the film may lack is a strong Hollywood hero image. The hero is played extremely well by Tom Atkins, but due to the older age/image he has and the woman he is helping the story line for his role it's not a perfect fit. The image is off to me a little and perhaps a more youthfully portrayed actor would have worked a little better. Personally I don't care, I enjoy Tom Atkins in films, but it is a back of my mind during a few moments. The other area is the transition from one scene setting to another, sometimes it feels a little forced or rushed. The next thing you know you at a new destination and it works OK. And OK sometimes is not good enough.As you can imagine the expectations on this film upon release must have been high. The third movie in the internationally successful Halloween series should be. Well maybe if the movie studios were not worrying about making guaranteed money hand of fist from people who wanted to see Michael Myers and instead they let the movie be what it a separate film all together this would have been known to be a great horror movie. Instead they branded it as a Halloween series movie and used images that were extremely misleading to the actual plot itself. Sometimes when you are marketed or told one thing and another thing happens this puts your mind off and you become confused, frustrated or disappointed. When all these things are happening, how can you give this movie a fair shack. Not to mention you are comparing it one of if not the greatest horror movie of all time. This movie had no chance and I am sure the studios knew, did not care and just wanted to make money. Thankfully the director and crew really cared and the effort can be seen.As another reviewer states accurately the title of the film creates issues. Personally if you go into this wanting a Mike Myers slasher film you will be immensely disappointing and I imagine may people are. This is why this film get so many mixed reviews, because at the core of the actual movie taking the expectations away this is a solid horror move.Final thoughts...If you are looking for a Halloween serial killer slasher genre movie, don't bother with this film. If you looking for a solid Horror film, with good story, Jon Carpenter music and Halloween day setting theme this film is a hidden Gem in my opinion.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
612,dumontmaiden,Don't listen to these dumb reviews. It's good!,8,18 October 2019,"After reading some reviews here, it seems that nobody truly understands this movie or the background of this movie. JOHN CARPENTER DID NOT DIRECT OR WRITE THIS FILM...idiots lol. John and Debra produced this film and John did the film score. ""Halloween"" was originally supposed to be an anthology series of films taking place on Halloween night. This film tried that, but unfortunately people loved Michael Myers/The Shape too much. If the film were not called ""Halloween 3"" it would've been better received. The film has a brilliant score by Carpenter, a great performance by Tom Atkins, and some great practical effects. What's to hate? I give it a 7.5/10 but felt like I needed to rate this at an 8 because of all the damn hate here. At least read up on the move you're reviewing...",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
613,jennifervanvegten,This movie is pretty great,7,30 September 2018,"I think that this movie should NOT have been associated with the Halloween series. I think that it is such a shame that so many people gave it a 1 star review because of Micheal meyers not being in it. I am not a fan of Micheal meyers, I mean c'mon he's been chasing jamie lee curtis since 1978 and he still hasnt caught her. If you wanna watch a fun, pretty original movie then I really suggest giving this one a try. Just remember going into it that it really doesn't have any association with the other films",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
614,tubamouthpiece,Great fun does not deserve the hate,9,3 October 2018,Halloween 3 is one of the most imaginative and bat shit crazy movie I have ever seen. It is nothing like the other movies in the franchise but it's not trying to be it is it's own movie. Everyone hates this movie because it has no Michael Myers but John carpenter didn't want another sequel because the Halloween series was never meant to be back to back sequels of Michael Myers doing the same old shit. This movie has a great sound track by John carpenter a load of fantastic special effects and a crazy concept that it pulls off well. If you a fan of horror or scifi check this one out.,Halloween III - Season of the Witch
615,edtheclaw55,How can you watch this movie?,2,24 October 2006,"Out of all of the Halloween movies. THIS IS THE WORST! The plot was horrible. They steal Stonehenge to take pieces of it and put it on Halloween masks to sacrifice kids? Who comes up with this stuff? The song for the mask is one of the worst songs I have ever heard. William Hung is better! There's some goofs here and there. Oh yeah basically everyone is a robot, who are filled with orange juice. The bottom line is AVOID THIS MOVIE. If you really want to see a horror movie just see the other Halloween movies or better yet, just see Snakes On A Plane. Its way better. This movie doesn't have snakes! Or planes! OR SAMUEL L. JACKSON!",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
616,bobbyreynolds-62320,Ahhh such birazze craziest 80s underrated stand alone bmovie classic you had to watch,8,1 September 2018,Everything in this cult underrated classic fun fun film all silliest inventory moments like how two android tried rip off a man head off insane! Even androids probably cover in orange juice or easter eggs then doctor had sex with robot the hole damn time until hilariously when tried call studio shut down every fricken channel or the commercial song ruled the earth i just every time i once watch of it and i can't believe jamie character from first two h20 as cameo.,Halloween III - Season of the Witch
617,johnwadequick,Holy sh** balls this sucked,1,20 June 2019,"Ok, I cant even begin to explain how horrible of a movie this is, if they gave me a choice between watching this again or blasting Yoko Ono records in my house all day and night, I'd say sign me up for Yoko",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
618,cparlo,Massively under-rated entry in the series,8,20 October 2018,"There's a reason ""Season of the Witch"" has steadily climbed most fan rankings of the Halloween series over the years. Its haters have always been so vocal whether because Myers is absent from the film or they simply don't like the story. Whatever--it's a glimpse of what the series could have been as an anthology. After ""Halloween II"" wrapped up the Myers storyline there really wasn't a reason to revisit the character. ""Season of the Witch"" detoured and in the process gave us a wonderfully fun schlocky Halloween movie to watch each fall. The story is about a shadowy global toy company with a horrific agenda to carry out on Halloween night. It's well acted, wonderfully scored, original, silly, and contains quite a few shocking kills.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
619,jtdaglis,Stop it! stop it!!,9,22 October 2018,All of these people reviewing this movie truly don't have a sense of good horror taste or humor. Tom Atkins graces this film on a murder mystery that turns into some great one liners by the man himself. Ya Michael isn't in it but you have to get over that part people and really love the movie for what it is. It stands out of the franchise but for a good reason. I thought the mystery behind the masks was awesome and the ending freaking ruled. I also got to see this movie On the big screen at a horror screening. It ruled and everyone had a good laugh.,Halloween III - Season of the Witch
620,kjscott-51804,A Halloween Classic,10,17 November 2018,"Look...if you don't get this film that's ok. Like most films it's far from perfect but it holds a very special place in my heart. I love Halloween (the holiday itself) and this film captures what it's meant to be within my imagination. It also should have been followed by 4, 5 and 6, etc. Granted Michael/Halloween I was a hard act to follow but as many film makers found out...it was hard to keep that one dimensional slasher story going. Season of the Witch was twisted and original. I would have liked to have seen other directors/writers take a shot at other Halloween based stories. Halloween themed films, all with different storylines, would have been really amazing. A new one every year or two!? Imagine that.",Halloween III - Season of the Witch
