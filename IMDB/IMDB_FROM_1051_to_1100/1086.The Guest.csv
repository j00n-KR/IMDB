0,Leofwine_draca,Nice little horror/thriller combo,7,4 February 2016,"THE GUEST is a fun, if derivative, little movie from Adam Wingard, the guy who also brought us the familiar-yet-entertaining YOU'RE NEXT. It's a belated addition to that whole psycho-thriller sub-genre of the 1990s in which ordinary families were menaced by mysterious forces, and it achieves plenty on what is clearly a tight budget.There are shades of THE TERMINATOR and the BOURNE trilogy here and it has to be said that the story is simplistic and straightforward. The denouement will surprise nobody, for example. However, like DRIVE before it, THE GUEST is all about the execution. It looks cool, it looks stylish, and it sounds cool too thanks to that thumping soundtrack. Dan Stevens is excellent as the suave and sophisticated guy who turns up to make a few waves, and Maika Monroe shows some of the promise that she displayed in IT FOLLOWS. Plus we get Lance Reddick, being exceptionally good again after his turn in JOHN WICK.In fact, THE GUEST has quite a lot in common with IT FOLLOWS, especially the horror-style unfolding of the plot. These films share likable young cast members and a fresh feel despite the familiarities of the situations in which the characters find themselves. Certainly nothing about THE GUEST is original, yet it's thoroughly entertaining at the same time. And that's all I need from a movie.",The Guest
1,SnoopyStyle,good not great,6,19 July 2020,"Laura Peterson is home alone when a stranger shows up at her door. He claims to be David Collins (Dan Stevens), an Army friend of her late son Caleb who died in Afghanistan. She invites him into her home. Soon, his outrageous ways start influencing the various family members.I really like Dan Stevens as the crazy guest in a psychological thriller. The incident with the football team at the bar is perfect. I'm rolling with a slow descend into a dysfunctional family chaos. Instead, the movie adds an outside military story. I am less impressed with turning this into a shoot them up. By doing that, David's interesting psychological disturbance becomes an experiment gone wrong. In some ways, it's less scary. This is good but it could have been great.",The Guest
2,Prismark10,Bourne again,5,23 September 2019,"The Guest is a routine action horror thriller of a stranger that starts out to be helpful. He is just hiding his psychotic feelings underneath.David Collins (Dan Stevens) turns up on the doorstep of the Peterson household. He tells mum Laura that he served in the army with her son Caleb who was killed in Afghanistan.David swiftly fits in with the family who have been badly affected with the death of Caleb. David helps out son Luke who is being bullied at high school. Only daughter Anna is suspicious when her boyfriend is arrested for murder.When the military police show up, all hell breaks loose. David is a one man killing machine who took part in some secret army program like the one Jason Bourne took part in.With it electronic score, The Guest harks back to those straight to video horror thrillers of the 1980s like Hider in the House.It is a serviceable film, Dan Stevens puts up a spirited performance but it quickly falls apart by the end.",The Guest
3,nogodnomasters,SUBJECT STILL ACTIVE,7,9 September 2018,"David (Dan Stevens) visits the family of a fallen comrade. They welcome him with open arms, but as a family they have their issues with bulling, boyfriends, and work. However, now that David is there, their problems are being solved, and not in the best way possible.This is another special ops helps family movie, not as cute as ""The Pacifier"" but certainly darker. We know David is not quite right from the subscript and crazed look in his eye, and it is just a matter of time before super polite David, the answer to their prayers becomes their deadly nightmare. The film kept me engaged although the MIB scenes seemed a bit hokey.Guide: F-bomb. No nudity. Quickly implied sex scene.",The Guest
4,kosmasp,More than a horror movie,9,14 October 2014,"It kinda starts like a normal home invasion by a psycho movie. That vibe is out there and everyone can feel that. Even the title does suggest it. But there is so much more. It actually juggles more than one genre to be exact, not to mention that it might leave you befuddled a bit by the end or even during the movie. On many things, like the main actor, who apparently was in ""Downton Abby"". So if you know that show, his appearance here might ""shock"" you even more.The director cited a few inspirations (also from the Science Fiction genre) and having watched it through, it makes more than sense. There is a change of pace and it almost gets ridiculous towards the end, but I do love it. Just the central performance is so captivating, that it's hard not to feel entertained by the movie",The Guest
5,classicsoncall,"""Never let anyone pick on you.""",6,7 March 2021,"There have been some pretty egregious cases of stolen valor reported over the past few years, but this fictional one goes way beyond bizarre. The explanation offered by Major Carver (Lance Reddick) for David Anderson Collins as a military experiment gone wrong was too simplistic to get away with, but it seems like the screenwriters went with it anyway. But I did like the way Dan Stevens portrayed his character, especially the smooth way he ingratiated himself with the Peterson family and some of the townies. But boy, plot holes and a lack of common sense occur way too often to make this a credible story. Like when Carver's assault team opened fire on the Peterson house without knowing if anyone else was in there. Really? And then, when David makes his break after killing everyone but the Major, how is it Carver arrived so far behind the crash scene that killed Spenser Peterson (Leland Orser), when he took off with David still in sight? Another Carver goof occurred when he yelled to Anna (Maika Monroe) and Luke (Brendan Meyer) to run away in the Halloween spook house; nothing like letting your enemy know exactly where you are when it's a matter of life or death. Predictably, the ending is telegraphed way back when David offered Luke his military knife, giving the younger brother a chance to make the save right before the cops arrived. But wait a minute, or did he? We're supposed to believe that after getting shot and stabbed big time in the middle of his chest, David makes his exit disguised as a fireman? As Joe Biden would be so apt to say, ""Come on, Man!""",The Guest
6,jboothmillard,The Guest,7,11 March 2021,"I remember hearing about this film when the leading actor was interviewed by Susanna Reid on Good Morning Britain and asked if he had to ""beat off"" loads of American actors to get the part lol, it was rated well and sounded good, directed by Adam Wingard (You're Next, Blair Witch). Basically, Spencer (Leland Orser) and Laura Peterson (Sheila Kelley), with their children Luke (Brendan Meyer) and Anna (Maika Monroe), are coping with the death of their eldest son, Caleb (Chris Harding), killed in the war in Afghanistan. They are visited by former army sergeant David Collins (Dan Stevens) who claims he was Caleb's best friend and appears in a photo alongside him and his troop. He tells the family he wanted to visit them to help Caleb take care of them. David is polite and friendly, and Laura invites him to stay for as long as he wants. David hears of Spencer's troubles at work, and he sees Luke return home with a bruise on his face, caused by bullies at school. The next day, David and Luke follow the bullies to a bar. David assaults all of them and uses his knowledge of the law, and a bribe, to stop the bartender from telling anyone. David goes to a party with a reluctant Anna, where he makes a good impression with her friends. He saves her friend Kristen (Tabatha Shaun) from her violent ex-boyfriend, and they have sex. David asks Anna's friend Craig (Joel David Moore) where he can buy a gun. On their way home, Anna offers to make David a mix CD. David gives Luke advice on dealing with bullies and gives him his butterfly knife. He meets Craig and his friend to buy the gun but kills them and steals their weapons. Anna becomes suspicious of David and calls the military to ask about him. She is told that David Collins died a week earlier. The call alerts a private corporation called the KPG, headed by Major Carver (John Wick's Lance Reddick), who assembles a special forces team and heads for Peterson's home. Anna then learns about Craig's death, which her boyfriend Zeke (Chase Williamson) has been blamed for, and that Spencer's boss died in mysterious circumstances, leading to Spencer's promotion. Anna takes David's phone to take a picture of previous numbers he called, asking Luke to research them. Luke is confronted by the bullies at school again, but he fights back. Luke is taken to the principal's office, Laura and David arrive and the principal may have no choice but to expel Luke. But David coerces the principal into believing it was a ""hate crime"" against Luke, for being homosexual, and threatens litigation against the school, unless Luke is instead given after-school detention for a month. Following this, Luke talks to David and mentions Anna's suspicions of him but promises not to investigate any further or tell anyone else. While David helps Laura with the laundry, Major Carver's team arrive and attack the house. David kills all the squad except for Carver. Realising his cover has been blown, David kills Laura. He drives away and kills Spencer who was on the way home. Carver picks up Anna and informs her that her parents are dead. He reveals that David was a test subject in a military medical experiment and was ""programmed"" to kill anyone who might compromise his identity and will not stop. Meanwhile, David kills Kristen and pulls a grenade to blow up the restaurant where she works. He goes to the school to kill Luke. Carver and Anna arrive there before David, and enter a haunted house set up for the Halloween dance. David turns off the lights and plays Anna's mix CD, then kills Luke's teacher and Carver. Anna shoots David with Carver's gun, but David stabs her in the leg and attempts to choke her, while the gunfire damages a light and ignites a fire. Luke stabs David with the butterfly knife, and Anna is freed. David tells Luke that he did the right thing and gives him a thumbs-up before collapsing. Anna and Luke rest in the ambulance as the firefighters arrive. They overhear that only two bodies were found, and Anna is shocked to see one of the firefighters limping, it is David in disguise who escaped. Also starring Ethan Embry as Higgins, Jesse Luken as Drew, and Candice Patton as Sergeant Halway. Stevens, best known previously for starring in Downton Abbey, proves a terrific choice as the antihero who appears to be a charming ""guest"" but is a sinister stranger. The first half is a questionable but interesting series of moments where the lead character shows his violent and manipulative side, and the second half goes all out with guns blazing and explosions, it is written relatively well and is a good throwback to 80s style B-movies, a watchable thriller. Very good!",The Guest
7,Coventry,Beware the unknown soldier,6,27 June 2018,"Although now given the opportunity to helm a much more mainstream and better financed thriller, it's abundantly clear that director Adam Wingard remains a true horror fanatic at heart. I wasn't necessarily the biggest fan of projects like ""V/H/S"" or ""You're Next"", but at least they were authentically raw and relentlessly violent horror accomplishments. ""The Guest"" is also brutish and bloody, but with a more commercial and socially relevant plot (the loyalty between, and the difficult reintegration of, war veterans) and a much slower tension building. But you don't fool us, Mr. Wingard, because particularly the revelation of the truth behind David's malicious behavior, and the entire climax set in a school hall decorated for Halloween, unmistakably reveal that you still prefer horror. The basic story is very identifiable for many people/families, but also original and dramatic enough to attract the attention of wide audiences. A mysterious but seemingly friendly and sincere soldier shows up at the doorstep of the Peterson family and claims he fought alongside their beloved son and brother Caleb who unfortunately got killed in action in Iraq. The grieving parents unconditionally welcome David into their home, the much younger brother immediately idolizes him and only the teenage daughter Anna is somewhat skeptical and doubtful about his real intentions. David turns out to be a dangerous but very manipulative and intelligent psychopath, while Anna is quickly considered as insensitive for suspecting him. ""The Guest"" unfolds like a typical early 90s thriller, because back then there were numerous of these false identity/charming intruder flicks (""The Good Son"", ""The Stepfather"", ""Raising Cain"", ""Bad Influence"", ...) and it felt rather refreshing to watch! The build-up perhaps takes slightly too long and contains too many clichéd situations, but the extreme change in tone and pace comes very abrupt and forceful. The last 15-20 minutes are also incredibly vile, with a few shocking deaths and ice-cold executions. The acting performances are more than adequate, with solidly convincing roles for Dan Stevens and Maika Monroe. The latter suddenly became a popular horror siren thanks to her part in the unexpected cult hit ""It Follows"".",The Guest
8,michaelRokeefe,A stranger is welcomed by a despondent family.,8,9 March 2017,"Adam Wingard superbly directs this dramatic blood-fest. A young, charming stranger named David (Dan Stevens) arrives at the home of the Peterson family claiming to be a friend of their late son, Caleb, killed in combat. They welcomed him with open arms, but soon things just don't seem right about him. And when a string of unexplained deaths comes to light, members of the family wonder if David even served with Caleb at all.Some of the scenes are jaw dropping and the sound helps keep your mind focused. Not a wasted moment and not a movie that has all of its ducks in a row. You can almost read David's mind before he goes into action; and yet most situations are not as predictable as you think. Blood, mayhem and suspense.Stevens is charismatic and Maika Monroe, as Anna Peterson, is very watchable. Also in the cast: Brendan Meyer, Lance Reddick, Tabatha Shaun, Chase Williams and Leland Orser.",The Guest
9,Theo Robertson,Intriguing Thriller,7,6 June 2015,"A young soldier called Dave turns up at the home of the Peterson family whose son has recently been killed in action overseas . Happy to see their late son's friend they invite Dave to stay longer and Dave quickly ingratiates himself in to the family's affection . But is Dave who he says he is and if not what is his agenda ? !!!! SUGGESTIVE SPOILERS !!!!! A familiar story , so much so that before seeing it I had it instantly nailed as a rip off from an episode of Brian Clemens THRILLER from the mid 1970s which had the exact same premise . Premise isn't the same as plot however and despite hitting the occasional plot turn with its bedfellows THE GUEST does have an idiosyncratic feel of its ownIt's something of a film of two halves . The first half sets up Dave to both the Peterson family and the audience and right away Dave comes across a very likable guy especially when he sorts out some school bullies on behalf of young Luke and much of his likability is down to the way he's played by Dan Stevens and it wasn't until after seeing the film I found out that Stevens is a Brit .Keep an eye on the name Dan Stevens because you might just be hearing a lot more from him in the future . In fact Dave is so likable I did find myself in agreement with Luke that it doesn't really matter who Dave is or what he's done in the past because anyone who can maim a few school bullies can't be all badBut THE GUEST has to follow a formula which means Dave has to be a bad man and a bad man is indeed what he is so when Anna Peterson contacts the military and Lance Reddick informs every spook in a fifty mile radius to shoot Dave on sight this gives a clue as to how bad he might be . Actually at this point the film might just be making a detour in to the science fiction genre but to be fair it's not as jarring or as leftfield as it could have been .From the outset Dave surprises people around him . He can run from the bus station to the Peterson house surprising Mrs Peterson , he can consume massive amounts of alcohol without getting drunk etc etc which suggests superhuman abilities along with the suggestion he's not human at all which means despite all the familiarity of the story and its flaws ( The ending is a bit over the top ) THE GUEST is a more intriguing film than you might have expected it to be",The Guest
10,Hey_Sweden,Stylish nonsense.,5,8 April 2016,"A patently ridiculous thriller, ""The Guest"" stars Dan Stevens of 'Downton Abbey' fame as a recently discharged soldier who visits the family of a comrade killed in action. He ingratiates himself to the parents awfully quickly, although the daughter, Anna (sexy Maika Monroe) is slower to warm up to him. He also endears himself to the son, Luke (Brendan Meyer), whom he encourages to stand up to those who bully him. Some suspicious events and circumstances later, and Anna is working at trying to learn more about this stranger.This silly but mildly entertaining movie tosses credibility out the window early on. The cast is good, but too many of the characters are thick headed morons whom you can't really sympathize with, so a possible end result is rooting for the antagonist to kill off everybody else in the story. It's somewhat absorbing for a while, when you have to wonder what ""David""s' motivations and plans are. But eventually all of that is negated by an overly mundane big reveal, and ""The Guest"" turns into a ""same old, same old"" sort of yarn, albeit one with an amusingly high body count and decent enough action sequences.Stevens provides some justification for watching by delivering a carefully controlled yet charismatic performance. You can't take your eyes off this guy. The same goes for Monroe, who's an appealing heroine. The presence of veterans Sheila Kelley and Leland Orser, as the parents, is welcome, but these characters are simply infuriating. Other familiar faces include Joel David Moore, Ethan Embry, and a solid Lance Reddick.Ultimately, ""The Guest"" is hurt the most by its aggravating, extremely clichéd ending.Five out of 10.",The Guest
11,LeonLouisRicci,Effective Mindless EntertainmentStylish and Fun,8,2 August 2015,"A Mindless Military Experiment Gone Wrong is the Recycled Plot of this Violent Thriller with a Tongue In Cheek Template that is a cue to Not Take it Too Seriously. The Back Story is the Least Effective not managing a Full Explanation, but no matter.It is a Ride of Pure Adrenalin and is not meant to mean much. The Creepy Dan Stevens is Excellent as a Conflicted Trained Killer whose Brain turned into Mush and He acts out of a Terminator like Mindset that has No Regard for Morality and is a Machine in the way He Murders Indiscriminately. It Makes No Sense to anyone and He has No Sense of Guilt or Scruples.

12,george.schmidt,Interesting-to-a-point thriller with Stevens handling all the heavy lifting like a boss,7,21 September 2014,"THE GUEST (2014) **1/2 Dan Stevens, Maika Monroe, Brendan Meyer, Sheila Kelley, Leland Orser, Lance Reddick, Tabatha Shaun, Chase Williamson, Joel David Moore, Ethan Embrey. Interesting-to-a-point thriller with stranger-in-town Stevens (uncannily resembling a very young Mel Gibson) who claims to be the friend of a dead soldier and infiltrates his family with charm and deceit unbeknownst to them of just how seriously dangerous he is as a threat to their lives. Menacingly charming Stevens does all the heavy-lifting of the touch and go script by Simon Barrett and Adam Wingrand's collaboration with steady assured direction with able support by Monroe as the shrewd teenage daughter, Meyer her younger bullied yet smart brother, veteran character actor as the out-of-sorts father and a nice return by Kelley as the blinded thru grief mother too trusting to a deadly fault. While the strengths play in large favor of its lethal lead the final act borderlines a slasher film with an incredibly eye-rolling plot point of just what really is making the homicidal hero tick.",The Guest
13,morrison-dylan-fan,Let the Right One In.,7,16 January 2015,"Originally planning to start my viewing of a trio of Bollywood titles from 2014,I started to hear about a gritty Thriller from a family friend and a fellow IMDber.With a friend having recently picked up the DVD,I felt that it was the perfect time to invite the guest inThe plot:Opening up the front door, Laura Peterson is greeted by a man called David,who says that he served in the war with her son,and that he has come to let Laura and her family know that they meant a lot to Laura's son.Getting set to leave the household,David is told by Laura,that due to him being a friend of her son,that the least she can do is to let David spend the night in the house with her family.Honoured by the invitation,David soon begins to help each of the family members out,as he goes from beating up the gang who have attacked Laura's son Luke,to defending Laura's daughter Anna from an ex-boyfriend at a party.As the rest of the Peterson's start to make David a part of the family,Anna becomes increasingly suspicious that David is not revealing the complete truth behind his war background.Contacting a military department,Anna soon discovers to her horror what her family have invited in.View on the film:Backed by a slippery score from Steve Moore,director Adam Wingard & cinematographer Robby Baumgartner coil the first half of the title with a ticking time bomb,as Wingard and Baumgartner expertly use silence to show the breaking facade of David,which is shattered by swift busts of blunt violence.Matching the tension built in Moore's directing,the screenplay by Simon Barrett grips the first half of the movie in a blood-soaked Neo-Noir fist,with Barrett using David's war background to build an uneasy atmosphere of something bursting out of the shadows at any time.After spending the first half releasing a nerve- wrecking,unpredictable mood,Wingard and Barrett set the title on a track going in completely the opposite direction.Knocking down all its Neo-Noir cards,Wingard & Barrett smash the title into a Sci-Fi wall,which along with being a ""shocking twist"" that I correctly guessed (whilst crossing my fingers that I would be proved wrong!) 30 minutes before it was revealed,completely destroys all the brilliant work that had been done.Despite being played by a tremendously chilling Dan Stevens,Wingard and Barrett chop all of the raw Film Noir edges from David,and replace them by turning David into a mindless shoot-em-up cardboard cut out,which leads to this being a guest who overstays his welcome.",The Guest
14,FlashCallahan,Like Sommersby on acid....,8,22 November 2014,"David seems the perfect guest. Friendly and helpful, this young soldier arrives on the doorstep of the Peterson family, claiming to be a good friend of their beloved son who died in action. The Petersons welcome David into their home and into their lives, but when people start mysteriously dying in town, their teenage daughter Anna starts wondering if David is responsible.......Coming from the makers of You're Next (I think I'm the only person on the planet who hated it), I had no hopes for this film, and the trailer wasn't the most exhilarating thing I've ever seen either, but nevertheless, I give any film a chance.But hands down, this is one of the years best releases, because it's daring, doesn't pull any punches, and the last thirty minutes are some of the most bonkers thing put on screen this year, and harks back to those straight to video exploitation movies from the eighties.But the most noticeable thing about the movie is the crazy narrative. It's as if many of the characters have some sort of mental health problem. Take Leland Orsers character for example, one of the most unhinged characters in the film, but his dialogue is straight up, as if his tics and uneasiness are normal for him.The cast are great, and Stevens, well he's a lot different than he is elsewhere, and I'm sure this is the beginning of a unique career, his titular character is a cross between Patrick Bateman, The Terminator, and Martin Riggs.Its funny, scary, and even though the final thirty minutes makes hardly any sense whatsoever, it's just so enjoyable.Add the fact that it has the best soundtrack to a film since Drive, you get one unique movie, that is destined for cult status.",The Guest

16,christopher-underwood,An absolute blast!,10,27 August 2014,"This begins at a fast pace with Dan Stevens, running along an empty road on his way to the house of the parents of a co-fighter in Afganistan, and barely lets up for the whole of its ideal and economical 99minutes. He befriends the family members and just when we think this may get a little tedious, the manipulation begins and our ride takes off. This is confident and very knowing film making. Just a look, when just a look is all that is required and a gut wrenching blow to a young punk when that is required. Indeed for the first section of this thrilling and visceral movie, it is fists that are the order of the day, the middle section sees guns come to the fore (and how!) and by the time w reach the finale we are fully into 80s retro slasher movie territory complete with halloween and haunted house motifs. The soundtrack is quite astonishing and contributes greatly, Dan Stevens is remarkable in the lead role demanding he be convincing in both empathy and ruthless brutality, and there is always a place for humour. This film was going to get top score but to finish allowing the audience a smile on their face is a bonus.",The Guest
17,siderite,Good acting from Stevens in a standard thriller plot,7,25 November 2018,"Someone comes into your life, you lend them your trust, then they turn out to be complete psychopaths. Classic plot, slightly reminiscent of your ex, so you add something more sinister, like a military experiment and a big showdown at the end. That's the entire movie. If it weren't for Dan Stevens in the central role, I would have called this a failure; as such, it's merely mediocre.To me, the entire external explanation, the military connection, was superfluous. Psychos don't need explanation, they are naturally born as a percent of the normal population. Instead of focusing on the real cause of fear: someone lacking any trace of empathy betraying your trust, they had an entire third of the movie be about guns and explosions. Oh, and that WTF ending. Literally. It was painful.Watch The Talented Mr. Ripley instead of this.",The Guest
18,KineticSeoul,Low budget fun,6,8 January 2015,"After watching ""You're Next"" which I thought was a decent horror flick with a bit of black comedy. I was actually forward to seeing ""The Guest"". And it actually did not disappoint. It's actually a mix of different styles of movies in one, it's slick, silly and cool. The premise of this movie has been done before, where a mystery guy enters a group of people lives and help back them up while having that certain mystery that revolves around that mystery guy. Watching this movie seemed like a mix of ""No One Lives"" and ""Stoker"" while also bringing in that 70's vibe. Overall this a cool movie with a intriguing build up despite it being done before. I give it a 6.4/10 because the third act was a bit disappointing. Maybe it's to set up for a sequel. Also Dan Stevens performance was spot on as this methodical stone cold military guy. I could see Bradley Cooper playing this role well, but not as good as Dan Sevens but that could be because of the age difference.6.4/10",The Guest
19,Hellmant,The type of stylized cult classic flick that I grew up on!,10,15 December 2014,"'THE GUEST': Five Stars (Out of Five)Violent action-thriller flick directed by Adam Wingard and written by Simon Barrett (the same team that did the the popular 2013 slasher flick 'YOU'RE NEXT'; as well as segments in the anthology horror movies 'V/H/S', 'V/H/S/2' and 'THE ABCS OF DEATH'). It stars Dan Stevens as a former soldier who shows up at a family's door, claiming to be a friend of their deceased son's (that died in war in Afghanistan). He offers to help the family (and is welcomed by them) but when people start showing up dead, it appears as though he could be somehow responsible. The film has received rave reviews from critics and also stars Maika Monroe, Brendan Meyer, Sheila Kelley, Leland Orser and Lance Reddick. Chase Williamson, Joel David Moore and Ethan Embry also appear in the film, in small supporting roles. I think it's awesome and one of the coolest movies I've seen this year!An ex-marine, named David Collins (Stevens), shows up at the Peterson family's door one day. He meets Laura Peterson (Kelley) and tells her he served in the Afghanistan war; with her son Caleb, who died recently. Mrs. Peterson invites him to stay at their house, against her husband Spencer's (Orser) wishes. David also meets their son, Luke (Meyer), and daughter, Anna (Monroe). The entire family is impressed by his charm and helpfulness but when people start showing up dead, Anna becomes convinced David is to blame and starts investigating him.The film has a classic 80s style genre feel to it. It's not completely a horror film, so it's a little different coming from Wingard and Barrett, but it is violent and suspenseful. It's also the type of movie where you're never sure what's really going on or what's going to happen next; it definitely keeps you guessing. Most of all I just found it to be very entertaining. The music is great, the acting is decent (Stevens gives a star making performance) and the style and feel of the film is spot-on. It feels like the type of stylized cult classic flick that I grew up on (and loved). I especially really like how likable the David character is, which makes it a really fun and interesting film to watch. It's just a great movie for people that love movies!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/N3ywdecCULw",The Guest
20,FeastMode,my notes,7,25 June 2019,"This is an example of a great ""regular"" movie. interesting, suspenseful, and good albeit brief action. a touch of horror and 80s movies. great soundtrack, reminded me a lot of Drive's (1 viewing)",The Guest
21,bowmanblue,The good outways the bad,7,25 January 2015,"It can't just be me, but when I watch a film, if there's enough good in there to keep me entertained, I'm much more lenient on it when it comes to its weaknesses. 'The Guest' is by no means a perfect film, but I did find it good enough to forgive when its plot went a little skittish.I read someone else's review online when they said it was a film of two halves – they likened the first half to the TV series 'Homeland' and the second act to 'Dexter.' Now, I haven't actually seen Homeland, so I can't say how true that is, but I get where they're coming from. The second half does have a distinctly different flavour to what comes before it. It opens with an ex US serviceman paying a visit to a family whose son was killed in a war. According to him, he knew their son and is there to pay his respects. Naturally, things aren't always what they seem.The first half is pretty tense and creepy with a definite air of foreboding about it. Then, about halfway through, things change and we're left with something that flits between 'action' and 'eighties slasher.' I can see why some people found this change a little jarring. The film does try and lead you one way, only to go off on a tangent.However, despite this, I still enjoyed it. Mainly due to Dan Stevens. Now, I must confess to never having watched Downton Abbey, so I had no idea who he was (in fact... I actually had to look him up online to realise he was British and not American, as his excellent accent would have you believe). He's a damn good hero. Or should I say antihero? You can't help but root for him, despite his obvious menacing tendencies. I defy anyone not to cheer as he takes care of some highschool bullies! Also, within the second act is an 'explanation' which brings in some extra characters/threat levels. I won't go into details as I don't want to spoil it for you if you don't know what I'm talking about, but this plot angle isn't explored as well as it could. There are still a fair few questions left up in the air because some aspects aren't explained as well as they could have been.All in all, The Guest is a solid enough little thriller which might have benefited from being a bit more focused. However, if you're in a forgiving mood, you should be able to see through its minor flaws and enjoy it for what it is.And, special mention to the electro soundtrack. The Guess has received a lot of praise online from being 'old school' and a throwback to the eighties. I guess that element went over my head while I was watching it, but, upon thinking about it, I sort of get it.",The Guest
22,ThomasDrufke,Timeless,7,14 August 2018,"The Guest is a film without a time period. And I mean that because they managed to make a present day film that feels like it could have taken place at any point in the last 50 years. It gives off an 80's vibe but also a post vietnam/Taxi Driver-esque feeling that is unsettling to say the least. Perhaps even more unsettling is Dan Stevens' performance as ""David"", a war veteran who returns to the family home of his supposed friend who died along with him overseas. What continues as the film dives deeper into David's psyche, is thrilling and surprising. The mysterious events that unfold as a result of his appearance bring a fascinating wrinkle into his story. However, I don't think the pay-off in the third act nearly lived up to all that was presented in the first hour. Sometimes mysteries are better left unsaid and I don't believe the choice they made about his motivations were nearly as interesting as it was initially presented. It tries to balance the line of revealing too much or not revealing enough, and I'm honestly not sure which I would have preferred more. But I guess that's just how some of these things go. Even still, the performances are terrific, the score/soundtrack is brilliant, and the direction is undoubtedly inspired.7.7/10",The Guest
23,A_Different_Drummer,more fun than a barrel of hammers,8,19 November 2014,"An old idea nicely redone with top notch writing and direction.This is a breakout role for Dan Stevens who manages to commit horrible acts while at the same time being pleasant courteous and generally the kind of guy you'd be happy to have as your friend.In fact, this is one of those rare movies where the viewer has more fun if you root for the bad guy (so to speak) right from the opening scene.Hard to find fault with. Even the action scenes are done with the sort of precision you would expect from a martial arts movie.For perfectionists only -- at 1:17 in the movie, there is an outrageous plot hole. While everyone, including the killer, is going to extremes to keep secret the government project that started this mess, a secret government agent agent suddenly spills the beans to a young girl for no reason at all other than to provide backstory.Overlook that, and this is a fun flick.",The Guest
24,851222,Entertaining,9,1 January 2015,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Guest"" 2014 was a really entertaining bloody action / thriller / mystery flick. It all worked here pretty well - director, writer, actors, composer - they all made a great work and it all clicks here for an entertaining flick. The central performance by Dan Stevens was superb. Watching this picture i was glued to my screen till almost the very last end. ""The Guest"" is definitely not the most original movie, but it's an entertaining for sure. It's bloody, sometimes brutal, but never over the top. I guess, if it wouldn't end of how it ended, i would really have given this movie a 10/10, but for the last part of this film it loses 1 point. Nevertheless, ""The Guest"" is not to be missed one if you are looking for some not a typical thriller (for the most part). A very well done flick.",The Guest

26,sol-,Let the Strange One In,7,9 March 2017,"Having charmed his way into the home of a recently deceased man he fought beside, a mysterious young soldier begins to help out his newfound surrogate family in increasingly violent ways in this strange yet undeniably intriguing independent film. Dan Stevens hits the nail on the head in the title role with an unpredictable wildness only just visible beneath his excessively polite and friendly exterior, and while it is easy to predict that something darker lurks beneath his facade, the first half of the film constantly keeps one guessing as to what exactly is going on. The second half of the film does not quite work as well with a vague suggestion that Stevens is some sort of super- soldier gone rogue in angle that leaves open far more questions than it ever answers, and while the film deserves some credit for having the most literal WTF ending ever, the lack of any solid explanation leaves one wanting more (some exposition scenes were apparently deleted). The second half of the film does, however, feature one of the most deliciously delirious thriller climaxes of all time, set in a 'Cabinet of Dr. Caligari' style Halloween maze constructed in the local high school's auditorium. Steve Moore's original score, clearly inspired by a lot of 80s music, is a very nice touch too and the action scenes towards the end are extremely well filmed. Whether the film clicks as a satire of military experimentation or a parable of war changing men may be debatable, however, there is little denying that it is one of the most audiovisually arresting thrillers of recent time.",The Guest
27,Floated2,Unique Thriller Provides Thrills,9,17 September 2015,"The Guest (2014) starring Dan Stevens. Suddenly when David (Dan Stevens) turns up at the Peterson household, he makes a show of expecting nothing more than to pay his respects over their son Caleb, who died while they were fighting together in Iraq. Caleb's grieving mother (Sheila Kelley) is happy to learn more about what happened to her boy, and insists David he stay for a night or two, rejecting his worry that he'd be an imposition. The father (Leland Orser) accepts David, too, grateful to have a drinking buddy to justify his hard turn to the bottle, and his teenage son Luke (Brendan Meyer) benefits from having a big-brother type to protect him from bullies. Only Luke's older sister, Anna (Maika Monroe), seems hostile but eventually she comes around.The questions hovering over The Guest, who is David, and what does he want? are answered in good time, but director Adam Wingard (You're Next) and his screenwriter, Simon Barrett, hold off as long as possible. There's something empowering and true about David's mission to protect and strengthen the Peterson clan, even if his methods are a little scary. In that respect, he's the unhinged soldier in the squadron: a possible head case, but at least he's fighting on your side. Elements of horror, black comedy, psycho thrillers, and social commentary merrily co-exist throughout much of the film, which keeps the audience as off-balance as the Peterson family as it withstands a rollout of chilling revelations. In the end, the audience witnesses a solid finale to a highly unique and underrated thriller.==================================================================== ====================================================================As a rewatch (08/16/17') The Guest remains a very sustainable and enjoyable thriller. There are obvious clues as to how the character is really a mysterious killer and we see the film unfold in a good way. More films as this one are welcomed.",The Guest
28,leonblackwood,Starts of well but goes downhill! 4/10,4,10 January 2015,"Review: I'm kind of in two minds about this movie, because the beginning is intriguing and mysterious but then it goes downhill. The random killings were a bit weird and the main characters past wasn't really explained that well, which made the movie a bit pointless. Basically, the movie is about a man who gets taken in by a family after he tells them that he served time at war with there son, but his sketchy past is questioned by one of the family members. When his true identity comes into play, the movie turns into an action movie and the family have to fight for there lives against the former soldier. The main character seemed to move around more like a robot than a human and his Paul Walker looks and striking blue eyes didn't really convince me that he could be a feared killer. Some of the fighting scenes were quite good but the sketchy storyline spoilt the movie for me. Average!Round-Up: Dan Stevens came to fame with his role in Downtown Abbey as Matthew Crawley and he has had some brief parts in the Fifth Estate and Night At The Museum: Secret Of The Tomb as Sir Lancelot. He hasn't really become an household name yet but he now has the chance to concentrate on his career after his departure from Downtown Abbey. This is his first major role after the hit series and I thought that he played the part quite well. The main problem is the storyline and I found the music pretty annoying. The director left the story open so I'm sure that we will be seeing a sequel soon. Budget: N/A Worldwide Gross: $2millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their mystery /thriller/action movies about a soldier who gets taken in by a family after serving time at war with there son, but his sketchy past and bad intentions are revealed after some investigating. 4/10",The Guest
29,jtindahouse,Wingard and Barrett are in fine form,9,24 December 2014,"There's nothing better than when a writer and director team up that have chemistry in abundance. That is clearly the case between director Adam Wingard and writer Simon Barrett at the moment. 2011's 'You're Next', 2012's 'V/H/S' and its 2013 sequel 'V/H/S 2' (only segments in the latter two) have all been nothing short of brilliant and now 'The Guest' is of the same quality (although a rather different sort of film). I'm delighted to see they have been busy boys and actually have some other work released in the last few years that I can now check out as well.'The Guest' is certainly more of a thriller compared to their other previously mentioned works which would all have to be classified as horror. It's not short on violence whatsoever though, something these two seem to have no quarries about depicting and which I applaud them for. Dan Stevens, who I would never have guessed was British, is absolutely brilliant in the lead role. His perfect balance of charm and malice make for captivating viewing. He's another I'm very keen to see some previous/future work from.The final third of the film is very different to the first two but still works its own way. Wingard seems to have a very unique style to his work which is incredibly refreshing. For some reason the opening title's colour, font and music just really worked well to set the tone for the film. It seems the two filmmakers are prolifically hard workers which is fantastic news because if they can keep churning them out this fast and at this high quality audiences are in for a real treat in the future.",The Guest
30,Turfseer,"Taut, gripping thriller in first hour devolves into meaningless psycho killer tale for the rest of the way",5,10 February 2015,"Adam Wingard's thriller, ""The Guest,"" is guaranteed to do quite well at the box office. The first hour is actually taut and gripping: David Collins, an Afghanistan war veteran, insinuates himself into the Peterson household, consisting of the parents, Spencer and Laura, and the two teenagers, Luke and Anna. It's David's claim that he was friends with army buddy Caleb, the deceased Peterson son, that causes ditsy wife Laura to so easily trust him. Spencer, a functional alcoholic, is a little more believable than wife Laura as he realistically is suspicious of David (he's worried that he might have PTSD and get violent). Eventually he too is charmed by David and welcomes him into his home. Luke is more of a nerd and is a victim of bullies at school and Anna has a pot-dealing boyfriend that her father can't stand. Although David is seemingly a malevolent figure, he sticks up for Luke at a bar, and pulverizes a few baddies that had picked on him earlier at school. But when David saved Anna's friend Kristen from an abusive ex-boyfriend and then asks her where he can buy some guns, we know David is no longer a friendly protagonist.David continues to skirt the line between demented psycho and impressive vigilante when he kills a guy selling him guns (along with Kristen's friend, Craig, who really is an innocent bystander). David also does away with Spencer's supervisor at work (off screen), enabling the father to obtain a coveted promotion. David also frames Anna's boyfriend, Zeke, by placing the weapon he used to shoot the gun dealer, in the kid's car (also off screen). While he's not tied to the murder, Zeke is still arrested for drug possession. We still don't know what David's motives are, especially after he intimidates the dean of Luke's school, not to punish him too harshly for fighting back against one of the bullies who attacked him again, in class.""The Guest"" devolves completely into a cheap gore fest when we find out that David was programmed to kill anyone who finds out that he was the product of a secret military program. David is no ""Terminator"" original but merely a psychopath who is immune to bullets (as well as a knife to the chest). One wonders why he didn't eliminate the Peterson family at the beginning but it appears that the film's scenarist wants to emphasize that he's a sadist at heart (that he enjoys playing with his victims). In the end, he ends up murdering the Peterson parents along with Anna's girlfriend, a military hit squad sent to eliminate him and other citizens in the town.David is no longer the charming anti-hero by film's end but a very unpleasant killer. Though Anna and Luke seemingly dispatch him at the climax, it appears he lives again, walking out from the crime scene, dressed as a fireman. The science-fiction behind David's ability to survive bullets and knife wounds, is hardly explained at all and his overall motives are a cipher. Somewhere the film's scenarists simply ran out of clever ideas and the tension in the first hour is lost for the rest of the film. ""The Guest"" has some mild entertainment value until the second half, when it completely falls apart.",The Guest
31,billcr12,Good Start but Bad finish,3,22 November 2014,"I am mystified by the high score for this movie. It starts off well enough when David shows up at the door of a suburban home and tells mommie dearest that he has just walked from the bus station and is delivering a promise to the family that their son loved them all very much, and Dave is delivering that message from the last moments of his life during combat in the Middle East. Of course, David happened to be his best friend in the military. Mom invites the stranger to stay at the house with her and hubby and teen son and hot blonde daughter. Strange and bad things happen to many people; some with severe violence. The first hour is silly but entertaining, nonetheless. The problem is the last twenty minutes or so where The Guest turns into an episode of the A Team. The acting is TV movie level and the ending pretty much ruins the whole thing.",The Guest
32,BeneCumb,Surprisingly good,7,16 January 2015,"This thriller was captivating almost from the beginning, and in spite of ""ordinary"", yet versatile events related to the Peterson family, there was constant mystery in the background, what would happen next and for what reason. The plot has multiple twists, actors are pleasant and convincing (particularly Dan Stevens as David Andersen Collins and Brendan Meyer as Luke Peterson), and tension is maintained up to the end, with distinguishing localities included... The length - slightly more than 1,5 hours - is just fair, and all open questions arising in the course of events will be answered in the ending scenes at least.True, the were some clichés, but the only ""weakness"" for me was the motive behind these cruel events, I prefer knowledgeable and character- based activities rather than induced ones. But, nevertheless, the movie is recommended to those fond of decent action, nice actors and research- based conspiracies.",The Guest

35,alindsay-al,A great thriller that is a refreshing movie,8,28 July 2015,"This film came up on my Netflix Que, so I watched the trailer and liked the premise and thought I would give it a watch and I must say I am really happy that I did because this is a great film that is actually pretty different and refreshing. The film sees a soldier arrive at a family's door saying he served with a recently deceased member of the family. So this family let him in to stay with them and then some shifty things start happening that causes questions. Now I don't know allot about the actor Dan Stevens who plays the guest in this film but I really hope i see more of him in the future because he is fantastic in this film. He plays this nice guy who has multiple layers to him and you can also tell there is a sadistic side to him which just shows how good a range this guy has as an actor. There aren't really allot of top quality performances from the people around him though, sometimes either the daughter, mother, father or brother will have an emotional moment and it varies whether you care or not meaning they haven't been a great foil for Stevens but sometimes they do a decent job. Now the story is really interesting there are a few clichés thrown in there but you see this man infiltrate this family and really try and help them out. Also when you learn more about his character I thought it made it an even more interesting film to watch. The script was okay with Stevens carrying the performance with his dialogue but everybody else felt a bit boring to be honest. The style Is fantastic, The action scenes are great and the soundtrack really helps this film deliver on its aims. The vibe of horror and thriller really works and makes this film a refreshing great film to watch.",The Guest
36,estebangonzalez10,Director Adam Wingard is always a welcomed guest at my place,7,26 November 2014,"""You did the right thing. I don't blame you.""The Guest had me sold at ""From the director of You're Next"" because I absolutely loved that slasher film and vowed to watch any upcoming project from director Adam Wingard. Fortunately I didn't have to wait more than a year, and The Guest came along. It may have not lived up to the hype, but it still was a fun stylized action thriller. Wingard knows how to blend genres effortlessly and despite having a familiar tone at times he delivers on the twists and switches gears on the audience. So despite borrowing elements from different movies, the way in which he blends them together allows for the film to feel fresh and unique. The Guest is heavily stylized and it plays out as sort of an 80's retro film with stylized visuals and a fantastic electro score which helps build the tension. Even the font during the opening credits is reminiscent of those early 80's films. The soundtrack along with Dan Stevens's performance reminded me of Drive, another sort of retro 80's movie. The Guest is an eerie and stylish film that builds tension so well during the first half of the movie that it makes it hard to shake off during the second half and leaves us expecting a little more. It is still a lot of fun and works as both an action thriller and a horror film accompanied with a small dose of ridiculous humor. The writer and director duo of Simon Barret and Adam Wingard are quietly turning into one of my favorite partnerships and I hope they continue to work together blending genres and stretching those familiar conventions into something unique and fresh.Just as I couldn't see You're Next working without the superb performance from Sharni Vinson, there is no way that The Guest could've worked without Dan Stevens's magnetic and cool performance. He is sensational and is a big reason why the buildup and the tension in the first half of the film worked so well. Stevens manages to be charming and menacing at the same time making it hard to guess what his real intentions are. The guy knows how to glare and smile really well. He has the chops to become a movie star. He plays Dave, a soldier who introduces himself to a family by claiming he was good friends with their deceased son. There is something suspicious about him, but he is so charming at the same time. The parents of the family who receives him are played by Sheila Kelley and Leland Orser, and their two children are played by Brendan Meyer and Maika Monroe. I didn't really care for the parents in this film, but Meyer and Monroe deliver solid supporting roles. Monroe reminded me of a young Gwen Stefani and she is also someone I look forward to seeing in future films. Barrett knows how to write interesting main characters because he has made both Vinson and Stevens look great in their films. The Guest didn't blow me away like You're Next, but I still had a fun time with this blender of a film. The score alone is worth your time, and there was a moment halfway through the film where it is the actual score that announces the change of tone and structure that we are about to get.",The Guest

THE GUEST grants that you can take programmed killers out of ""in country,"" but illustrates how they bring the killing fields home as their permanent FIELD OF DREAMS.

He says he knew their son who died in war, that he was with him when he died, that the son told him to tell his family that he loves them and to watch out for them. So that's why he's there. The sweet-voiced mom asks him to stay the night since he has nowhere to stay and nothing to do. He meets the bullied teen son, the 20 year-old daughter who's rather indifferent to him but a little suspicious, th dad who can't advance in his job because he doesn't have a degree. The dad initially doesn't care much about him but finds in him someone who will listen to his complains about the wife and who's there to have a beer with him, so he asks him to stay a couple days more.Seeing that the nice kid is being bullied, the stranger decides to take action. He picks the kid up from school, follows the bullies to a bar, provokes a fight, and royally kicks their behinds. The mother asks the daughter to take him to a party. There he meets a girl. Also some guy whom he asks to get him a gun. And he also meets the girl's boyfriend who sells drugs. At this point the girl, who sees him as someone respectable and someone who cares, starts developing the hots for him. Next morning she overhears him on the phone talking about fingerprints, dental records, and that someone is looking for him. Her suspicions are confirmed. She gets some numbers off his cellphone and calls the army base to ask about him. She's told that the person with that name is dead. The call also raises an alarm at a military contractor. When she confronts him in front of her family, it turns out that the father's boss has died from an apparent suicide making him the boss now. And the girl's boyfriend is in jail accused of killing a gun dealer and the friend who met the stranger at the party.By now the military contractor launches a mission to get the stranger. A high executive and a team of mercenaries leave enroute to the house. As soon as they arrive the run into him and a shootout ensues. And from there the story unravels.The Guest starts very strong. The character of the stranger is really great. But the movie far too early announces that he's trouble with ominous sounds and certain looks that the character gives. Casting is strong with the exception of the awful Leland Orser and the laughable squad of mercenaries. The movie initially is also very funny. But unfortunately the movie takes us somewhere we don't want to go. In the process, the quality of it also diminishes somewhat. But the movie has lots of personality, is original and unexpected, it handles relationships well, and Wingard and Barrett just know how to make movies. The soundtrack is indeed awesome full with late 70s early 80s synth sounds and music and it's not cheesy. While strictly speaking not a horror movie, it's filmed as if it were a horror movie which makes it the more intriguing how things will turn out. The guest is a fantastic effort with franchise potential.",The Guest

45,Seraphion,A Bourne movie for Halloween,6,14 June 2015,"The story gives a rather neat twist to the common psycho killer Halloween movie story and makes it into something fresh. Furthermore, the movie nicely places itself as not the usual Halloween horror movie by having the actual horror show only at the very last part of the finale. Yet it also stays true to the Halloween cult movie ingredient by depicting all the classic premises, even the scoring does too. What I like about this movie is that the story builds rather slowly compared to other Halloween flicks, thus making it more normal to enjoy. Even so, the acting overall is still a mid to low level of acting. None of the cast really presented something. Particularly, Lance Reddick is quite charismatic with military roles.

Which is okay - experiment gone wrong, thousands of bullets etc, but it deflates expectation after the promising start.Finally it turns into a ridiculous hunt through a Halloween house of mirrors, where all the pipe laid in earlier scenes is mechanically dug up.

48,quincytheodore,The Guest brings smooth style and satire in his stay,7,19 March 2015,"Creepy stranger premise has been used in horror or mystery to varied effect, the latest Jennifer Lopez's flick is an example of how not to welcome this premise. Luckily, The Guest has the luxury of having suave lead actor and good atmosphere for a thriller. Some of the kinks are predictable, but the dark humor as well as bizarre revelations offer much needed novelty to the movie.David (Dan Stevens) arrives at the Petersons resident, claiming that he was a friend of their fallen son. He's well-mannered and seems trustworthy, thus the family welcomes him openly. Upon his stay, strange accidents begin to happen, and suspicion arises with the casualties. The most important hook is Dan Stevens' portrayal of David. He looks like a rugged debonair, this is not average smooth, this is Ryan Gosling's level of smoothness.Stevens delivers a wide variety of emotions, he can be either friendly or deadly. Backed by good cast, such as Maika Monroe as the Anna Peterson and Lance Reddick as Mayor Carver, the movie has a solid degree on acting performance. The exchange of banter is enjoyable, often resulting in manipulation or downright violence for David's benefit. It elevates the human drama between him, the Peterson family and whoever unlucky enough to be in their immediately vicinity.Mystery of David's real identity is crafted slowly and it's compelling enough to pique interest without revealing too much. The film also has a touch of humor, albeit slightly crude. Strangely, in the third act it changes tone drastically for the climax. This shift is a bit odd considering it plays the thriller aspect with steady pace for the majority of early parts, although this explosive tone does have the merit of being entertaining.There are short bursts of Hollywood style carnage, but they are modest, not all out gunblazing from the start like Bourne or the recent John Wick. Action sequences are well choreographed, it has both devastating and ridiculous impact.. Good practical effect for the blood and explosion as well as its highly unorthodox soundtracks make the faster pace scenes more satisfying.Having good mesh of action, mystery and comedy, The Guest is enigmatically fascinating.",The Guest
49,Sergeant_Tibbs,Style over substance done right.,7,3 February 2015,"Films that tread the line between satire and parody are very hit-and-miss for me, especially when they're in the guise of a serious action movie. The Guest gleefully embraces its style over substance and provides satisfying but guilty revenge geared action. It smirks, knowing how silly it is with its over-the-top sound editing, but it rarely crosses the line where its edge is shaved off. No doubt that the most time spent on this film is the aesthetics with the detail in the lighting and the selection of the soundtrack, and it does pay off in looking and sounding pleasant and engaging. These types of B-movie-esuqe films can be quite interesting in their representation of basic dynamics, but The Guest provides enough thrills that it's not bogged down by either being too thin or too subversive to the point of contrivance. It could have used way more subversion really. It doesn't provide much beyond superficial entertainment and feeds off its homages to films like The Terminator without developing or updating any ideas. It's well-executed in the technical department but nothing much special.7/10",The Guest
50,Screen_Blitz,"Dumb, Fun Thriller",7,30 June 2015,"From filmmaker Adam Wingard, director of the slasher horror film 'You're Next', comes a tense white-knuckle thriller complete with slick action thriller elements and dark, grim atmosphere. The Guest centers on David Collins (played by Dan Stevens), an Afghanistan war veteran who returns from active duty and pays a visit to the family of his friend Caleb Anderson, who was killed in combat. With David set with nowhere to go, his parents (played by Sheila Kelly and Leland Orser) grant him permission stay with them for a while. He seems like a charming guy and makes good friends with their daughter Anna (played by Maika Monroe), a troubled teen girl who is dealing with boyfriend issues like many other high school typical high school females, and their son Luke (played by Brendan Meyer), a young freshman who's often a designated punching bag for bullies at school. However, when a string of people begin getting murdered under mysterious circumstances, the family comes to realize that there is something not right about David, possibly connected to a crime organization. The Guest isn't exactly a horror film, it is more a thriller with mixes of action scenes, including fist fights and gun shootouts. While the plot is dumb and somewhat predictable, it still manages to be fun in its own way, generating plenty of white-knuckle thrills to make up for it's flawed screenplay. Dan Stevens gives a strong performance as David Collins as he gradually progresses into a more and more mysterious character, though the unraveling of his character's evil demeanor is a bit easy to predict. Throughout the most of the film, his character would constantly do everything to prove he is a nice and caring person by doing good deeds for the family including aiding Luke on standing up against kids who are constantly targeting him. This of course, involves him doing so in the most unconventional ways, like teaching the son Luke how to fight or showing hostile action towards the kids that harass him. It almost hard to tell sometimes whether he is a kind-hearted person or a cold-blooded criminal or a good guy with major inner demons. That is what makes the film fun and suspenseful to watch, if a little formulaic.The performances from the rest of the cast are okay I guess. Maika Monroe's acting could use some improvement though, same thing with Brendan Meyer. The rest of cast definitely doesn't stand out from Dan Stevens, but there isn't too much to bark at. Overall, the film wasn't too bad. If you are fan of suspense thrillers, this is strongly recommended.",The Guest
51,areatw,"As ridiculous as they come, but great fun",7,28 April 2019,"I wasn't at all prepared for what 'The Guest' had in store but I'm certainly glad I decided to watch it. Although I was expecting something a bit more serious, and with a more credible plot, I can't really complain as this was ultimately a very enjoyable film that seemed to fly by.While primarily an action thriller, 'The Guest' is also many other things and has elements of horror and drama, as well as satire and black comedy. Perhaps surprisingly, it all comes together well and the result is a slick, stylish and very entertaining film. Though, if you try to take the storyline and characters seriously, it's probably going to be more frustrating that entertaining as both are completely ridiculous.Don't think too much and don't go in with any expectations, and you are sure to be entertained!",The Guest
52,gedikreverdi,The perfect soldier creates a hero out of a loser,8,7 April 2021,"Her playlist was indeed good David. After they lost their soldier son, a friend of him from the army showed up at their house saying their son wanted him to tell them some stuff. It kept me guessing a long time what's off about him and it didn't turn out to be a cheesy thing. It was good to watch him beating the bully kids at the bar after school for the late soldier's nerd younger brother. He also stood up for the girl at the party and beat her ex and helped the father get a promotion by killing his superior. It was such a functional guy as he was designed to be the perfect soldier in a military lab and he managed to escape. He killed everyone that knew about him because he was designed to leave no trace of him behind. He killed the woman at the house when they busted the house. On his way away from the house he deliberately crashed the father's car and killed him too. He also killed the girl she helped and made love at the party and blew up the diner. Then the siblings with a military police ended up in a Halloween maze as the boy was grounded after standing up for himself and beating the bully who called him a slur. He came over and put on the cd at the DJ booth that the girl made for him and the kids survived because the boy managed to stab him with the knife he gave him as a gift. They were sitting at the back of a van outside with firemen and the girl saw him coming out disguised as a fireman. And they said one of the bodies inside didn't have his teeth. I'd love to watch a sequel to this as the anti-hero was flawless and really fun to watch.",The Guest

54,brchthethird,A thrilling genre exercise from the makers of YOU'RE NEXT,7,21 January 2015,"From the director of YOU'RE NEXT comes an action-horror hybrid that has more than a few tricks up its sleeve. One day, a mysterious stranger (Dan Stevens) shows up at the doorstep of the Peterson family. He claims to have known their deceased son, Caleb, and says that he's just there to check up on them. However, things aren't quite what they seem and when bodies start turning up the daughter Anna starts to question who this guy really is. First off, I'll say that I really enjoyed the film. Tonally, it reminded me a lot of 80's horror movies, as well as with the structure. However, the soundtrack and score gave off the vibe of an action thriller. It was an interesting combination that made for a unique viewing experience. As far as the actual story goes, though, it wasn't too original but still effective in what it set out to do and a very enjoyable watch, in my opinion. Without going into spoilers, I'll say that a good comparison can be made with the original Terminator film. Also, in the sole featurette, the star Dan Stevens said he heard it described as ""Captain America gone wrong."" I'll let that stand on its own so as not to ruin it for the potentially interested. From a more technical standpoint, all of the action was well-staged and filmed, and quite brutal. Not quite horror-level violence, but still pretty intense for an action/thriller. Also, all of the performances were excellent. I'm not familiar with Dan Stevens work on DOWNTON ABBEY, but I'm pretty sure this role was a far cry from that. Overall, if you're a fan of indie action films that keep you guessing, you should have a great time with this.",The Guest
55,adamscastlevania2,"A decent little watch, but annoyingly over-rated",6,6 February 2015,"(60%) If double features had lived on, then this would have been the fantastic ""Cold in July"" B-picture follow-on. As while this is an entertaining sit, it's still unquestionably a B-movie that's well within touch of the better examples of strait-to-video action fluff. The film's concept in all honesty isn't worthy of merit, as it inevitably becomes a cuckoo in the nest type of affair akin to the one found in Hitchcock's classic ""Shadow of doubt"", only here it's much cruder, more fatuously told. And considering the quite rave reviews endowed upon it, which in turn has only over-inflated expectations, meaning this had a difficult task from the very start in hitting its questionably high target. Also on the DVD cover this quotes ""The Bourne identity crossed with The Terminator"", which is a terrible summery as it's not like either of those films. It may feature a character who is a waitress (Sarah Connor), and have a cool 80's electro score, but as for the Bourne movies? It's pushing it. What this does have is a touch of quality, it may only be a touch, but it's enough to mean that the performances/direction are both fine, and it's always watchable. But is that really enough? As a rental possibly, but I'd stick to a free watch only for this over-hyped time-passer.",The Guest

And a good one too, I suppose it has been done, but this was a nice fresh background and all the pieces fell with some style and to top it all off, a really fun atmosphere of background retro new-wave rock score really gave this pulp juicy brand of fun film making a really cool extra couple of juicy twists to add to the already fun cool experience.

57,jrarichards,"Pretty meaningless ""programmed soldier"" fare",6,5 November 2017,"Director Adam Wingard's lack of interest in convention chimed neatly with Dan Stevens's desire to distance himself from ""Downton Abbey"" in the weird and not-so-wonderful piece of film-making that is ""The Guest"". As I noted in my less-than-fulsome review of the (2015) film ""The Boy Next Door"", ""The Guest"" - or rather Stevens's portrayal of that guest, bears quite a striking resemblance to the work of Ryan Guzman as Noah in that other (apparently later) film. Sporting a serviceable American accent (somewhat recalling that of Andrew Lincoln as Rick Grimes), the Brit Stevens appears as David, who starts off by bringing such joy and enrichment to - and a kind of justice on behalf of - a mourning family, that it is all the sicker (and ultimately all the more implausible-looking) when he later turns on said family, which he kills and/or terrorises, in the course of killing and terrorising pretty much everyone else too. Of course, he can't actually help it because - in the second film that emerges out of the cocoon of the first - he is actually a ""modified"" soldier programmed to kill everyone around him once the safeties are taken off. That is a message that could be offered deeper treatment (as it is somewhat more so in films like ""Morgan""), but not too much so in this film.Do I need to say more? The film is violent, at times a bit erotically-charged and all-in-all rather pointless, though one cannot exactly say it is badly-acted. For my money, Maika Moore does especially well here, while poor old Lance Reddick (again playing a somewhat Broyles-like part) hardly gets into his stride before being bumped off. Stevens himself is OK.",The Guest
58,bryank-04844,"'The Guest' was a lot of fun and again, it might be your favorite horror film of 2014.",9,12 August 2015,"Filmmakers Adam Wingard and Simon Barrett have struck gold again. They pleased critics and genre fans alike with last year's slaughter fest 'You're Next' and made great entries into the 'V/H/S' franchise. Their new film 'The Guest', which Wingard directed and Barrett wrote, is one of the most entertaining films of the year. Not only that, but Wingard and Barrett single handedly revitalized the horror genre with this movie. It's a hit to the nostalgic testicles that will make you fall to your knees and yell for joy.Wingard said that he came up with this film when he had the 'Halloween' and 'Terminator' Blu-ray in front of him and thought, ""Hmmm..I have an idea."" I have no doubt that this film will surprise and thrill audiences around the country, let alone woo the genre fans, leaving them wanting more out of this psychological horror film. Wingard and Barret left the bigger gore effects on the back burner this time around and let this film play out like a very suspenseful thriller, although you might get your dose of gore in the third act. But one thing is for sure. Wingard and Barrett know their horror genre to a tee.Laura (Sheila Kelley) and Spencer (Leland Orser) are still in dark fog over the loss of their eldest son when he was killed in Afghanistan as a soldier. One day, a man named David Collins (Dan Stevens) shows up at their door and tells them he knew their son and that they were in the same squad. He also informed them that he came straight to their house after he was medically discharged from the army hospital to fulfill their son's last request, which was to give his parent his love and make sure they're okay.Their two other teenage kids Luke (Brendan Meyer) and Anna (Maika Monroe) are a little hesitant about David, but after seeing how polite he is and how he helps around the house, they feel a little more comfortable. Even after Laura and Spencer invite him to stay in their dead son's old bedroom for a while, the family seems to be at peace and moving on. Luke and Anna warm up even more to David's unique and mysterious charm as he helps Luke with some bullies at school and is a shoulder to cry on for Anna when her boy troubles come back to bite her. However, Anna is still not 100% sold on David, and after a few people in town turn up dead, she phones the military to see where David came from. The results are not good and David may not be who he says he is.What works so well with 'The Guest' is Wingard and Barrett's slow burn approach to the horror and suspense. Even though David seems nice, he always seems fairly scary, like he has a different agenda. And that comes with Dan Stevens' performance, which is incredible. One minute you can be putty in David's hands, the next, you'll want to run the other way. He's fantastic in this. Monroe turns in a great performance as well, and Orser is as always, brilliant and funny. Wingard and Barrett inject some dark humor throughout the screenplay, which receives some good laughs and the backdrop being Halloween adds to the nostalgic feel from the 80's horror films we loved as kids.The score of the film is phenomenal and was done by Steve Moore. It was like he got John Carpenter to come back to the keyboard and help him create the tone and atmosphere of the film. And with songs from Love and Rockets, Sisters of Mercy, and Stevie B, you'll be reminiscing in your head of when you used to blast these songs on your tape deck years ago. 'The Guest' was a lot of fun and again, it might be your favorite horror film of 2014.",The Guest
59,ersinkdotcom,Another sleeper hit for Director Adam Wingard and Writer Simon Barrett,8,21 September 2014,"It didn't take much nudging to get me interested in seeing ""The Guest."" After watching Director Adam Wingard and Writer Simon Barrett's horror masterpiece ""You're Next,"" all it really took was an engaging trailer with their names attached to it. Let's just say that the duo have another sleeper hit on their hands.A military veteran returns from his tour of duty overseas. David seems to be the genuine article. A soft-spoken and well-mannered young man, he arrives on the doorstep of a fallen comrade's home to tell his family his dying words and wishes.With nowhere else to go, the family invites David to be their guest for a few days as he makes plans for the future. It gradually becomes all too apparent that their new visitor might not be who he claims to be as his behavior becomes more and more erratic. What sort of skeletons does David have in his closet and where did he really come from?While the story isn't all that complex, ""The Guest"" works on so many genre levels that it can't help but rope in and keep the attention of a diverse audience by offering something somewhat unique. As you walk into the theater, you think you're getting a straight-ahead thriller. Halfway through the film, you discover Director Wingard and Writer Simon Barrett aren't satisfied with just offering you the status quo. They're driven to throw caution to the wind and deliver something unexpected to viewers.Actor Dan Stevens has a bright future ahead of him. He takes audiences through a roller-coaster ride of emotions as you get to know his character and re-discover him all in the span of 99 minutes. There's points where you love the guy and then want to see him get his own come-uppance in some violent and horrible manner. Stevens does all this with steely charm and commanding eyes that have a sort of mesmerizing effect on whoever he's interacting with.""The Guest"" is rated R for strong violence, language, some drug use and a scene of sexuality. The violence in the film is really no more than what you see in a typical action movie. There's some female upper nudity in one particular spot, which in my opinion could've easily been avoided and opened the movie up to a broader audience. Women get an eyeful as well when David comes out shirtless and wet after taking a steamy shower. He also likes to mellow out at parties with a few drags off a joint.Director Adam Wingard and Writer Simon Barrett definitely have a formula that works for them and it shows once more with ""The Guest."" They take everything you know about the action, horror, and thriller genres and blend them together into a tasty and compelling concoction. However, they find a way to turn all of it upside down just as soon as you ease into what you're experiencing.",The Guest
60,MattyGibbs,Decent thriller,7,12 November 2016,"A man claiming to be a friend of their dead son ingratiates himself into the family, but is he all he seems? This is an entertaining film despite it's fairly ludicrous plot. Whilst it's execution is clumsy it does provide a number of decent scenes and it does hold your attention throughout. This is largely down to a good cast. Dan Stevens is excellent as the charming stranger with an element of menace about him and the Maika Monroe and Brendan Meyer provide good support. The plot moves pretty quickly and there is some good tension built up as to what the guests true intentions unfold. Whilst not overly violent by today's standards there is still a fair smattering of it on display here, some of it surprising. Whilst I enjoyed this film and thought it well worth a watch, I was still left with the feeling that with a stronger script this could have been better still.",The Guest

This is until an unexpected visit by one of their son's comrades, David, who returns with a message from Caleb. David ingratiates himself with each family member. He is flush with cash, muscle and wit. He wins friends wherever he goes, even as he takes on bullies young and old. In their excitement to embrace such a fabulous character, the family glosses over many red flags. They may be sorry for this. The film is an energizing and intoxicating cocktail of different genres including horror, action, comedy and thriller. There is some depth here, not just teen angst. One sympathizes with each character. Many scenes are thrilling just in themselves, such as when David confronts a group of thugs on the high school football team. Just before he deals with them, David buys them drinks; blowjob shots for their girlfriends and cosmopolitans for themselves. This does not go over very well. Music is used to good effect, including ""haunted"" by Love & Rockets. Seen as part of the ""midnight madness"" series at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival.

65,dfa120374,Homage Or Not....The Guest Is Still Lame,4,6 April 2015,"If you like predictable plots, cheese, and plenty of clichés, then you'll enjoy The Guest because all of that is here and more. I've read reviews saying the movie is like that on purpose as it's ""paying homage"" to those older styles of action/thrillers, but in all honesty I think those people are just trying to defend an extremely below average film, because that's all this is...homage or not.It may be a throw back to those 80s/90s films, but that doesn't make it any better.The main story itself is a given, but it's the predictable elements throughout that got me. I know movies like this tend to get that way, but it would have been nice if a wee bit more thought was put into it rather than just making it so obvious all the time. A film can ""pay homage"" to an older style but still bring it's own elements into it.The film does start off decently enough...it's goes at a decent pace, and the story starts to unfold quite nicely as it goes on. There's still the odd dodgy moment, but there's nothing too bad. Unfortunately, as the film proceeds, instead of getting better, it gets worse, and the odd dodgy moment turns into laughable/unbelievable moments, especially with what happens during the elite forces team and ridiculous ending scenes.As for the characters and acting....well, let's just say that some of that definitely left a bit to be desired as well. Dan Stevens as ""David"" delivers a mixed bag because one minute he does fine, but the next moment he seems to struggle especially when performing the more dangerous elements of his character. Not for the action, but more for the psychological parts....he just doesn't pull off a convincing psycho for me. As for the rest of the cast? Wooden spoons all round! As a side note - a good deal of the soundtrack - especially for the end scenes - was hideous as well.All in all, The Guest definitely has more going against it than for it, and if it was done right it could have been a very decent action/thriller.",The Guest
66,DareDevilKid,"Brutal, Vicious, Suspenseful, and Highly Entertaining",9,4 January 2015,"Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)Rating: 4.5/5 starsAdam Wingard is fast blooming into one of Hollywood's horror/thriller wizards, and ""The Guest"" more than lives up to the promise borne from his last stellar effort, ""You're Next"". Admittedly, he's helmed a few turkeys prior to ""You're Next"", but now it seems safe to say that he's settled into his groove and churning out generic treats seamless assurance. Up until recently, it seemed that horror fans had only James Wan to turn to for quality material in today's times. Well, thankfully, Wan has now got the promise of another Director, passionate for the genre, to keep him company. And we sure hope that he fulfills his promise.But, ""The Guest"" would not have been half the film it is without the standout, badass performance from its lead star, Dan Stevens, of ""Downton Abbey"" (TV Series) fame. Just a simple wicked smolder of Stevens makes something as innocuous and supposedly pleasant as a smile seem like a weapon of mass destruction. In a just world, this small but handsome film would turn Dan Stevens into a full-blown, true-blue movie star. But if he continues at this rate, it's safe to say that his TV days are behind him, and big-budget leading roles that will guarantee superstar recognition - and maybe even a cluster of awards - are just round the corner.The beauty of ""The Guest"" is that even though it borrows from other genre pictures, it does so with such intelligence and clarity of purpose that it manages to feel fresh and exciting. The plot is something we've heard a dozen other ways before: A soldier introduces himself to the Peterson family, claiming to be a friend of their son who died in action. After the young man is welcomed into their home, a series of accidental deaths seem to be connected to his presence. The plot provides a template in which a figure who should be worthy of trust insinuates his way into an all-American family with deadly consequences. However, the real pleasures of this movie lies mainly in anticipating how the next expected corner will be turned. ""The Guest"" unravels smartly; and, after too many herky- jerky entries in the faux-found-footage subgenre, it's nice to see a scare film (horror or thriller - you name it) with a pearly visual style, which gives the enterprise the patina of both elegance and plausibility. This smartly assembled, visceral thriller is tense, action-packed and unpredictable like everything and nothing you've ever seen before. Empire Magazine called it ""a demented action- horror hybrid of sci-fi conspiracy thriller and gore-fest"", and Vanity Fair said, ""'The Guest' is big, it's bold, it's badass, full of flavor Hollywood wishes it could pour over its vanilla blockbusters.""The film also feels like a throwback of sorts, a new movie reminiscent of John Carpenter's twisted works from the 1980s, including the diabolical electro-synth score. Hell, just like Carpenter's or even Wes Craven's memorable endeavors, ""The Guest"" too has instances when the pieces of this puzzle don't quite mesh, yet the result is consistently surprising. And just like with the films of the aforementioned auteurs, we're more than willing to overlook such lapses in Wingard's recent effort. To sum it all up, ""The Guest"" is what might happen if John Carpenter made a Halloween movie in which Michael Myers takes off his mask and turns out to be a pretty cool guy.With ""The Guest"", Wingard and his writer, Simon Barrett, whom he frequently collaborates with, have once more upped the ante for the indie horror/thriller flick pack. Both the Director and writer - the same team that brought us ""You're Next"" - have created a suspenseful, edge-of-your-seat thriller that's brutally vicious yet has a flair for fun. Boasting enough intelligence to bolster its darkly violent thrills, ""The Guest"" offers another treat for genre fans from Director Adam Wingard.",The Guest
67,davidgee,From Downton to Haddonfield,7,12 September 2014,"You kind of know from the beginning that this guest is not all that he seems to be, like Richard Gere in SOMMERSBY. The casting against type of DOWNTON ABBEY's Dan Stevens was a good move. Seriously buffed up, he produces a convincing if stateless American accent and is very persuasive as the handsome stranger who is clearly too good to be true.There's a sci-fi element in the storyline which needed a bit more detail. The fact that the high school is making elaborate preparations for Halloween brings in some strident echoes of John Carpenter's 'masterwork'. THE GUEST is a hokum movie with too much of the kind of violence younger audiences now expect and crave, but a sturdy performance from Stevens makes lifts his transition from Downton to Haddonfield out of the B-movie slot where the derivative script would otherwise have left it.",The Guest
68,bbickley13-921-58664,Another great experience from Adam Winguard,8,24 September 2014,"I went to go see this movie based on how amazing his last movie, You're Next was, and I found out that he also contributed to V/H/S which was another unique experience in horror. This is the guy I need to watch.Though the bar is set very high with You're Next, the filmmaker does make an enjoyable follow up. This feels influenced by movies if the 1980s, similar to the movie Drive by Nicolas Winding Refn. To be more specific, the film reminds me a lot of the giallo films coming out of Italy at the time. This is thanks to its awesome musical score that help set an interesting tone for the film.Speaking of Drive, it's funny that they used Dan Stevens who kinda reminds me of Ryan Gosling. He plays the title character, A man coming home from the war calming to be a friend of a grieving family's son, and charms his way into their lives. Dan had the same kind of intense coolness that makes Gosling a superstar. The movie was done well, adding a lot of elements you would not expect to go together, but makes for a great experience at the movie theater. Worth watching.",The Guest
69,MattBrady099,The Guest is freaking amazing.,7,18 November 2014,"Adam Wingard the director of this movie Previously did: You're Next and the short films from V/H/S 1&2, but now he direct's his new film The Guest and this is one of his best.The story is about a soldier comes the Peterson family, claiming to be a friend of their son who died in action. But as a series of accidental deaths occurs, the welcomed man soon turns into a suspect. Before seeing this movie I known nothing about it. I haven't heard anyone talking about it so I pretty much went in with a open mind knowing nothing, and after viewing I can say that The Guest is freaking amazing and brilliantly flawless with one of the best soundtracks I heard since the 2011 movie Drive. Dan Stevens did a outstanding performance as the nice guy that has a dark and uneasy side to him, which Stevens nailed that and I would love to see him in more movies. The rest of the cast did really good as well.The soundtrack in this movie is just so beautiful to listen to, and it may be the best soundtrack I've heard since Drive and all John Carpenter movie soundtrack. The soundtrack had that 80's and 90's nostalgic feeling to it which made the movie and the soundtrack even more awesome. No words can describe it, it should be viewed by people who love nostalgic music and movie lovers.The cinematography and the writing in the movie was just top notch and this has to be the biggest surprises of the year for me, because I wasn't expecting how fantastic and well done it was. I'm not going to give it the perfect rating as I thought I was going to give, because I don't this movie was ""The best movie ever made"", no it's really not, but still this movie is awesome.",The Guest
70,ArchonCinemaReviews,Cool concept - not quite there tho,6,28 January 2015,"The Guest is an unevenly toned thriller with a strong start and a stereotypical 'action' conclusion, but stick around for the entertaining soundtrack.The Guest is an action thriller that takes a unique concept with a horrifying spin.Director Adam Wingard and writer Simon Barrett continue to carve out their own space in the horror genre with their latest film, The Guest. The Peterson family recently lost their eldest son who was serving his country in Iraq. A fellow soldier and friend to their son who died in action introduces himself to the family. The man known only as David is welcomed warmly into their home, but not all is what it seems when a series of deaths seems to be connected to his presence.Wingard and Barrett have not mastered their genre of film-making to a flawless end but with each film added to their resume they improve substantially, as is true with their most recent movie The Guest. The casting of Dan Stevens as the mysterious and potentially malevolent but honorably discharged soldier is their first successful decision. With Stevens the film's tone sets off ominously and full of well paced tension.As a whole, The Guest is a bit formulaic but it is in a self-aware manner that pays homage to the retro films it emulates. Case and point? The killer soundtrack and song choices for the film. And yes, they are that original and entertaining that it is cause for explicit distinction in a film review.Of course, with most films that try to be original, the ending is completely nonsensical and disjointed from the earlier groundwork scenes of the film. The twist and explanation for David's nature is painfully unoriginal and the action sequences, though thoroughly entertaining and mildly comical, follow suit.The Guest is the type of film good for a one time watch.

71,nikola17,My Top Thriller Film 80s,10,10 May 2015,"i have already full in love with this movie a lot, this is my top thriller since i am Action Martial Arts Fan i do like Sometimes different movies Horror,Comedy,Thriller,Gangster movies. this was my another top thriller films New Age 80's Style Movies"" like Drive (2011) and Cold In July (2014)i loved the 80s style to me i thought it was horror movie like serial killer like Halloween but i don't know why people say it's mixed with Terminator, John Carpenter Halloween but i didn't care what people say about this movie i loved it i am huge fan of 80s 90's style.(Dan Stevens)David Collins was friend Caleb who died in War Afghanistan come to Caleb house to his family mother Laura Peterson (Sheila Kelley) was mother and father Spencer Peterson (Leland Orser) i liked Cast i don't mind all fine i didn't care or have any problems with anyone, they did a very good job (Maika Monroe)one of my favorite actress Anna was daughter was my 2nd favorite character in film and Brother (Brendan Meyer) Luke Peterson. that's the all family that David Meet, i thought David was a very smooth very smart very charming, he treats everyone very well in family.Action Scenes were fantastic when he beats the crap of bully's in bar David Character i would say he's got evil Jason Bourne taking evil Jason Bourne but i am going with 80's slasher style Action scenes were good no shaky cameras, 80s style Dan Stevens got GREAT Performances in film. he was really good i liked him in Walk Among Of Tombstones (2014)Liam Nesson i love all action scenes was good blood and gore were so awesome. really good actor sold performance in film Dan Stevens got Shape like Michael Myers in Halloween school but the ending kinda got me upset just keeps you waiting until what happens next ? but i don't wanna spoil movie for everyone else. everyone say's where Guest 2 ? i guess there won't be Sequel i just got very curious. director had great idea was a great stand alone just like (Drive) 2011 Ryan Gosling.meaning you don't what's going to happen next. The soundtrack made the movie more than it could have been otherwise.Maika Monroe playing a waitress and even has a similar outfit to Sarah Connor. Apparently Dan Stevens was made to watch the first 2 Terminator films back to back before filming for the Guest. So yeah absolutely, the creator is clearly a big Terminator fan. i am 80s Action fan until today i find my favorite thriller movie The Guest just sold greatest performance i wish this movie would come out Cinemas I hope they make a second one Dan Stevens had style like Ryan Gosling, Luke Evans the way he acts and he is very smooth character,actor soundtrack I the music is great reminding of the movie Drive (2011),Cold in July (2014) you have that same feeling watching those 3 i had watching. Such an exciting film, I never wanted it to end. But, as much as i enjoyed the film. No sequel, it's already as good as it gets, instant classic. 10.10 i Want Dan Stevens to do more movies like this, get more roles like this 80's style The whole the guy you trust is not who you thinks he is type of movie. Sounds like the lead delivers a great performance but that alone feels like it is main reason why the film stands out from the rest and is let alone worth a watch. I will check it out sometime for the performance by Dan Stevens, and for the score. But this does sound like a 10.10 worthy flick at all to me. T-1000 should be Dan Stevens because they said they can't find guy like Robert Patrick for 1-1000 but they find Asian guy for T-1000 but they can't find Asian guy for Teenage Mutant Turtles for master splinter ? but this is right guy for T-1000 Dan Stevens should be cast, everyone said it's crossover Terminator to Bourne Identity then he should be Villain for Terminator apart from getting lee byung Hun and Jason clarke..",The Guest
72,midnitepantera,DRECK!!! Complete DRECK!!!,2,21 August 2021,"I liked the main actor Dan Steven's from Downton Abby, but this was a garbage role for a paycheck I'm guessing. :o
It started out a bit interesting, but just kept going downhill, like a Giant boulder out of control. There was just NO WAY to Suspend Disbelief and they just wanted you to do it more and more with the ridiculous action scenes toward the last part of movie. I was laughing because it was just SO BAD and STUPID! My eyes were literally rolling up in my head uncontrollably.This is a good choice for the guy and robots at Mystery Science Theatre to Mock while they view it. Literally the only way to give this movie any value is for the robots to crack jokes about how BAD it is. REALLY, It's THAT BAD!!",The Guest
73,avik-basu1889,A tale of two parts !!!,5,15 October 2015,"'The Guest' is a thriller directed by Adam Wingard and written by Simon Barrett. It stars Dan Stevens, Maika Monroe, Sheila Kelley, etc. A strange, good looking man named David arrives at the doorstep of the Peterson family under the most suspicious circumstances. He says to Mrs. Peterson that he was there with her soldier son when he died and promised her son that he would visit their family just to tell them that their son loved them. Mrs. Peterson gets caught up in the emotion of her son's memory and ends up asking David to stay in her late son's room for the time being. What ensues next is absolute madness.'The Guest' is clearly a film which is self aware and the director and writer is clearly giving a tribute to all the exploitation slasher/horror films of the 1980s. It is a bit funny in parts too. The first hour of the film is fascinating. Dan Stevens' charm is inescapable. He pretty much drives the whole film forward single- handedly. He plays this intriguingly mysterious character. You know he shouldn't be trusted, still you can't help but in a way want him to get away with it. Stevens craftily juggles the prospects of looking charming as well as threatening side by side.But unfortunately after the setup in the first hour, the film completely falls flat during the last act. All hell breaks loose at the end with people getting killed everywhere and blood spurting all round. This is supposed to have a comic edge to it, but the comedy escaped me and I found myself getting bored. However the soundtrack of the film is worth listening to and it clearly is inspired by the music of the 80s. The direction and cinematography is good for the most part, but I just couldn't find myself caring during the madness in the last section of the film.So the film certainly has merits. The first hour is enjoyable. Dan Stevens is brilliant. The soundtrack is great too. But I found the last act of the film to be pretty flat which left a bad taste in my mouth overall.",The Guest
74,rooee,"Come in, make yourself uncomfortable",7,13 November 2014,"I was convinced this film was set in the 1980s until someone whipped out a laptop. The retro aesthetic recalls Nicolas Winding Refn's interminable Drive, but this is a far smarter and snappier film. Dan Stevens even resembles Ryan Gosling, except Stevens remembered to pack his charisma. In a star-making performance, he's mesmerising as an angel-eyed demon. Fans of Downton Abbey may be surprised to find him affecting a soft Southern American drawl and stabbing women in the heart.Stevens plays David, who turns up on the doorstep of the grieving mother of his Marine unit buddy. He claims to have been friends with her son; to have watched him die. David gradually seduces the entire family: preying on the parents' emotional vulnerabilities; protecting the son from bullies; flashing his pecs to the daughter. There's great enjoyment and inherent humour in the fact that we know he's up to no good while the family fall for his pragmatic charms. (Hitchcock would have been grunting with delight.) Only when the bodies start piling up do the family start asking questions of their guest.Apart from Stevens, all the actors bring their ""A"" game, to be fair. I particularly enjoyed Leland Orser's perennially nervous father, with his sad eyes and his burgeoning alcoholism, still in the denial stage. Maika Monroe also gets a juicy role as the hormonal daughter, negotiating her way around a community of jock douchebags and petty drug dealers.CGI-free and reference-heavy, from the towering title font to the moody synth score, this is a direct throwback to those late-'80s/early-'90s domestic stalker thrillers that we 30-somethings remember watching in secret on fuzzy VHS. The Hitcher, Cape Fear, The Hand that Rocks the Cradle, Sleeping with the Enemy et al all loom heavy, along with countless movies with words like ""Fatal"" and ""Deception"" in the title. At its best it's like John Carpenter in his ruthlessly efficient heyday.The first two thirds of the film are an engrossing and surprisingly plausible slow burn, before events surge inexorably toward the pyrotechnic. The final act is bold but nonsensical, failing to live up to what preceded it. But overall this is superior, nasty B-movie fun, and far more inventive and darkly witty than Adam Wingard's previous film, the strangely overrated You're Next. Highly recommended.",The Guest
75,dansview,"Long, Predictable, and Stylish",6,2 August 2015,"OK,I will give it style points for sure. Great 80's-ish soundtrack in the vein of Tangerine Dream's work on Risky Business. Awesome use of a Halloween setting, and starring the hottest girl I've ever seen in my life. Nice work with all of that.But you could probably have achieved the same effect without showing the killings in such graphic detail. Regarding the plot and the explanation for the main character's actions, I have to agree with some others that the writers just didn't care enough. Essentially they said to each other, ""Ah, who cares about the explanation, let's just let the director load up on style and we can go to bed early."" I would have preferred to see the character struggling emotionally and intuitively with his condition. I will however give them great credit for not stooping to a love sequence with the girl and the weirdo. They resisted and that may have been the best decision they made to save the film from further cliché status.Like so many others, this one was simply too long. Cut out a few gratuitous conversations and end it all quicker.The British guy was good. The dad and the black soldier boss were reunited from another indie project on Netflix about a cult de-programmer.I would not watch it again. It's too one-dimensional. But I don't regret the time spent. It held me.",The Guest
76,James_De_Bello,8/10,8,19 February 2015,"Well that was a blast. Most fun I ever had this year with a movie. Two minutes into this film I had a smile that covered my face ear to ear. That never stopped, not even after the credits rolled and I still have a trace of it as I am writing this review.The molding of tones, themes, genres and different scenes is so seamless half of your brain will be only captivated by it the other half will be saying I do not know what the f**k I am watching. But, trust me, you will love it! Adam Wingard and Simon Barrett have really achieved something special here that can be even seen as a very, very particular lesson in filmaking. Bravo to them, because even if some of the elements in the film did not work for me personally, I could see how they had a vision, they knew what they wanted and they nailed it perfectly. Also a very cool element is how over the top some parts are, but they are treated as so and therefore never taken seriously enough for the film to loose you. Cast all around is really surprisingly good yet Dan Stevens in my humble opinion and I know this is far fetched for many people, but he is Oscar worthy. I talk about charisma often and how by having just a charismatic good actor/actress in your lead your movie can elevate immensely, well I am going on the record and saying that in this particular movie, Dan Stevens is the definition of charismatic and he actually meets the greatness of predecessors like John Stewart of Tom Cruise. His performance is what great acting is about and I literally could not take my eyes off him. Just amazing, stunning work really: he was riveting to behold and gives, in my opinion, one of the top 5 performances of the year.I do have to say that the first act and a half was so good that I was kind of let down by the remaining part of the film. I was still having a blast, but it definitely went a little off the rails for me and even lost me at one point, yet quickly captivated me again with the climax. That is probably the only fault I can find with the film, but I find it to tone it down quite a bit because I was having such a good time in the first half or more that the second or less half had me somewhat underwhelmed, even if it still was doing lots right.Please check this original film out, give it your support it really deserves it. I had no idea what I was in for when I watched it and man was I pleased to have done so when it ended!",The Guest
77,AJ_McAninch,Irresponsible Script,5,21 June 2020,"Reasonably good acting, but too many plot holes, poor development, and unanswered questions. And the ending tries to be smirky clever but is lame in light of everything that has happened. As an aside: this is an innocent family still grieving a son and brother who died in the Army, and thus it was an extremely insensitive script.",The Guest
78,TheMarwood,Very amusing B material,7,8 December 2014,"The only thing surprising in The Guest is just how straight forward it is in its simple plotting. Everything unfolds in predictable fashion, but this B material is a fantastic showcase of wicked humor and misanthropic violence. Dan Stevens is in excellent form here, as a mysterious soldier who shows up unannounced at a family's home of a fallen soldier he served with. He's all smiles and very polite, but people with a usually negative connection with this family start meeting grisly ends. Like in his previous film You're Next, Adam Wingard approaches plotting you've seen a million times and wittily turns it on its ear without ever being too self aware. It's a shame Picturehouse who acquired the US rights dumped the film in a handful of theaters without trying to capitalize on the strong reviews and never bothered to expand it theatrically. The Guest is a quick fun time that knows exactly what it is and delivers without overstaying its welcome.",The Guest
79,troyputland,Oddly gripping.,7,24 July 2015,"The Guest is an oddly enjoyable film. It packs plenty of hooks from the moment the 'guest' enters the house of his old army friends' family home. 'David', as he calls himself (Downton Abbey's Dan Stevens), is an enigma. He says little but carries a high level of intrigue by attaching himself to his dead buddies' family. He becomes over-protective with the Petersons, particularly with the young daughter, Anna (Monroe) and her brother, Luke (Meyer). He uses extreme, enthralling methods to help both out of tricky circumstances. Too many inexplicable deaths happen in town and only one person's to blame. The Guest's absorbing up until to the final chapter when David's mysterious background's revealed. His state of mind changes, and the narrative takes an illogical turn. Dan Stevens manages to uphold his character's mentality as the film dips in to the fanatical. Strong acting takes a leap forward, making the change in the narrative's frequency only a minor irritation .",The Guest
80,deepfrieddodo,A Decent Thriller,7,11 November 2020,"A really decent thriller, sometimes you expect these B-movies to be poor, but The Guest has many good qualities. Most importantly, it is a thriller, and the climax certainly has you on edge. Stevens plays his part well, and although it may be a cliché character, at least it's executed properly. Mostly though, the music interweaved into the story really creates the best atmosphere throughout, and improves the overall watch substantially.However, the plot is somewhat unoriginal, with clichés frequent. There are big gaps which would connect all elements of the film to help it make perfect sense. Plus, a times you just wonder how daft people can be, and whether in real life people would actually go along with half of this stuff?",The Guest

82,ritera1,Intriguing but clunky,7,28 April 2016,"This is the kind of piece that interests the writer with the elements that it's trying to convey, but the finished product ends up very uneven.It wants to create a character, the quiet man of action, who helps a family with his brand of justice. Actually the actor, Dan Stevens, was very good in the role. A bit more it would have been hammy. So we go through elongated scenes to demonstrate his prowess in fight and in charm. Kind of irrelevant when the first 45 minutes of the film are detailed in a paragraph on the box. But then the girl smells something bad and, of course, spills part of the beans to everyone else. This alerts the government who wants him and knows he's a danger. I did find interesting the quick scene where the boy doesn't care if the lead did actually murder anybody. Then we launch into the finale that was well executed but highly illogical. The group of well-armed military (with no body armor) blindly enters the property where the highly dangerous target is thought to be. No reconnaissance. Zero.Of course they are then murdered, one by one. And then conveniently clicks into killing the mother and father. He ends up killing the military leader and then leaves the gun next to the body, for no reason except the girl needs it to shoot him 2 minutes later.In the end we have a teaser of a possible sequel, which is good business. But we still really don't know why this guy visited the family in the first place. And used his real name (which I guess was needed in order to have a 3rd act). I was actually thinking that he'd turn out to be the long lost brother/son they were all mourning in the beginning (due to the plastic surgery element, which turned out to be completely irrelevant). It was just a variation on the Michael Myers/Jason Vorhees theme. And I'll finally mention the odd choice of music. Was that rejected Tangerine Dream and Psycodelic Furs tracks?",The Guest
83,dommercaldi,"A Stylish, But Rather Vapid Thriller",6,8 October 2020,"Pros:
1. The combat is greatly choreographed, hard-hitting and exhilirating to watch.
2. The pounding bass soundtrack does a good job at heightening the tension and suspense.
3. Dan Stevens (""David"") gives a fantastic performance.
4. The comedy is subtle and, when it lands, produces some hilarious moments.
5. The violence and gore is brutal and unforgiving, especially when Laura Peterson (Sheila Kelley) dies.
6. The pacing, considering the minimum substance, is incredibly succinct and well-done.
7. The entire last fight scene in the haunted house high school setting is beautifully shot, entrancingly intense, and just enjoyable to watch.Cons:
1. ""David"", who comes from a military background, is conveniently reckless in answering a secret call right outside the Peterson household, which ends up being the beginning of the end for him.
2. Somehow ""David"" survives, and it just feels like a cheap way to pave the path for a sequel.
3. The tone is a little confusing at times as the movie doesn't seem to know when to introduce the comedy, and when to play it serious.
4. The characters of Laura Peterson, Spencer Peterson, and Luke Peterson (Brendan Meyer) are heavily underdeveloped.",The Guest

It is shot so well. The colors are fantastic and used very stylishly with the music and other effects (like light and smoke.) This film is visually very pleasing.
The story is very intriguing, and kept me wondering throughout exactly who ""had it right"" in the story. Every turn was so satisfying, and your like for each character grows throughout the whole film. The acting is very well done.
The film pulls at your heart strings a couple of times in a very compelling way, not cheesy at all.
Finally, the action is great. Good fight scenes throughout.
In terms of the ending, simply perfect. Makes you crave an immediate sequel!!

88,dallasryan,Slick and Fun,8,24 October 2016,"The director understands the fact that a good soundtrack goes a long way with the right ambiance of a film, and the the soundtrack in this film is terrific. It's excellent in fact.On that note, Dan Stevens cuts glass in this character, he is a bad ass and a half. Stevens' 'David' is a cross between Maverick, Iceman, Patrick Bateman and Ryan Gosling's character in 'Drive.' Monroe and Meyer are also terrific in this film, well acted all around.Furthermore, the genius of this film lies in the fact that they don't give too much away, they leave it for you, the viewer's imagination, to guess what exactly was up with everything and that mixture works perfect for a movie like this. You don't want to give everything up in a movie like this, very smart writing.Lastly, you will love the ending. The ending will have you cracking up and saying this was a great freaking movie.

However, all the time i was wondering why the 7.5 was given to it. The movie is not more then a 4 in any respect. Like if this is the only movie you have to see and nothing nothing else, then go for it. But its not something you wanna watch over a weekend as a nice movie. It does keep you in a suspense but when it ends you are like is this the damn climax i was watching it for. Not much worth the money and the time. Could have done better, way better.

The movie is enjoyable decent paced but the outstanding part of the movie is Dan Stevens, his character is charming, helpful and yet unsettling and very sinister, he plays it perfectly, you end up on his side especially in the headmaster's room.

92,robsta23,"Not a Hidden Gem, But it Looks Good",5,2 June 2015,"A friend of mine had recommended this movie and gave it to me after he and I watched a fight scene which happens fairly early in the movie. Sadly, this scene and the other ""action"" sequences in the film are the only great thing about The Guest while it maintains a good style throughout its duration with good cinematography.The story itself is a letdown, at least in my eyes. A young man just out of the military stops in on the Petersons, whose son Caleb had fought alongside the man, David. He says that he promised Caleb to protect his family, yet Caleb's sister has her suspicions as he is seen to be very hostile at a party she invited him to. The rest of the family sees nothing wrong with David, but Anna calls the base David was discharged from, and we get scenes revealing something went wrong with David and the squad he was in when he was overseas, leaving the audience with a thrilling mystery. Sadly, this mystery is revealed through the man leading the military police to take down David, and it is less complex than it could have been: SPOILER - the military did a medical experiment on David and his squad, and David rebelled and made it out alive after the experiment was conducted. The experiment was used for a specific mission, and now David is ""programmed"" to kill anybody who might give up his identity since it may compromise his ""mission,"" whatever that is. The best part of the film is Luke's struggle to recognize David as a hero/villain since David is the first person to stand up for him, although David presents himself as dangerous on a number of occasions. This was the only really defined internal struggle in the film, and they could have made Anna - who I consider the main character - have more complex insecurities like Luke. To me it was only fun to watch Luke and David, Luke because he is the underdog who we feel sorry for, and David because he kicks so much ass.I really could not stand some of the acting in this film though. The Peterson (parents) seemed to be reciting lines like they were eager to have their lunch breaks instead of truly getting into their characters. Especially the dad. From the first scene he appears in it is hard to read him; he seems mad to have David as a Guest but then does a 180 without really changing his tone of voice or anything. And the next night drinks a good amount of beer with David while going on a rant about his life. Are you happy or sad that David is here? It's hard to tell when you only act with one tone in your voice the whole movie and without mannerisms to make you a unique individual.Sorry Jon, I don't feel this film was underrated as you did, but it is fun to watch David at certain points.",The Guest

I am not trying to impose a superior view on anyone, but honestly, this movie is the type that you would expect to watch on a Sunday afternoon right after lunch when you're objective is to fall into a peaceful sleep and have the best nap ever.

94,blakiepeterson,A Sleek Horror/Comedy Hybrid,9,2 May 2015,"Ow! Agh. My lord. It hurts. It hurts! What are you doing? Don't touch it! If I said it hurts, why would you touch it? Get — Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't see you standing there. You see, I have just finished watching The Guest, and it seems that I have been left with a painful slice right at the center of my psyche. These piercing blue eyes — piercing blue eyes belonging to Dan Stevens that is — have filleted everything I've come to remember about piercing blue eyes (and no, this isn't some supremely weird way of introducing some brand new ""trait of the week"" event). Over the years, Paul Newman and Robert Redford and Steve McQueen and Frank Sinatra and their blue-eyed buddies have made a pair of cerulean irises nature's equivalent of an ""I Will Be Playing the Hero of This Movie"" button and sash. Blue eyes aren't always just a decorative attribute used to add extra flash to nifty cinematography; they also make for a symbol that represents a certain all-American hero type (a la Captain America, Frank Bullitt). But for the first time in the saga of blue-eyed heroes, we are given one that we don't quite trust. He's not even a hero really. When David Collins makes his initial appearance at the Peterson household, something immediately seems off. Despite a Southern charm that he wears on his sleeve, it all seems too good to be true. Currently, the Peterson family is mourning the recent loss of their eldest son, who was killed in battle. And when David shows up at their doorstep, claiming that they were close army buddies, David is taken in, as a guest and maybe as a replacement. Normally, I would utilize this moment of the review and make fun of the Petersons, who are making perhaps the biggest mistake you can make in a horror movie (or whatever The Guest wants to call itself); never let a stranger into your home, no matter the circumstances. And yet, I can't. David says he knows their son. He even has a picture to prove it. He has blue eyes too. He's basically Steve McQueen. Now tell me: would you, or would you not, let Steve McQueen into your home if he showed up on your doorstep? Admit it. You would.But I digress. Strange things begin to happen shortly after David arrives. Father Peterson's boss is mysteriously killed. Daughter Peterson's (Maika Monroe, in a breakout performance) drug dealer boyfriend finds himself framed for a double homicide. Son Peterson is suddenly unbothered by bullies. Is this all too coincidental, or does David have something to do with it?I'm being intentionally vague. Films this exciting and this in love with themselves (and their audiences) rarely come along with so much assurance. The Guest is an amalgam of cinema's most nutso flavors. The font of the opening credits hearkens back to the cray cray days of '80s horror. The action (and bloodshed) is a little bit Kill Bill and a little bit The Terminator. The humor is oft one-linery in the same competence of a better-than-usual 007 adventure. Even the carnage could make Quentin Tarantino smile. The Guest shouldn't work — it's basically set up to be a subpar homage-a-trois — but Wingard and Barrett (You're Next) are not delusional amateurs hoping to make 1+1 equal an '80s slasher movie fonted 2. It could equal 3 for all they care. They could convince us in just a few secondsThe Guest is no-holds-barred, but it is smartly no-holds-barred. The plot is psychotic, but Barrett's great handling of dialogue (which is mostly minimal and to the point) and action (which threatens to explode like a Diet Pepsi post shake-up but stops before too much damage can be done) is tight and subtly astute. Wingard escalates the tension with such ferocity that we can only be thankful that the characters leave their suspicions at a low-level until it's much, much, much too late.Even better is Stevens, who I am told is currently starring in Downton Abbey. I've never seen the much adored series, but I'm sure that Stevens rarely gets the opportunity to play a shady, increasingly lethal foe. He is a tour de force as David. If The Guest was better known as an action film rather than a hidden gem, he'd already be getting a much coveted supporting role in the upcoming Star Wars film, which seems to be kidnapping all the up-and-comers with a life-sized magnet. But it doesn't matter. The Guest will eventually be considered a cult classic, and if David Collins becomes as infamous as someone like The Stepfather and The Terminator put together, Stevens will be happy. And so will I. This movie deserves notoriety. And when I use italics, you can count on the fact that I'm being dead serious. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to go get a Band-Aid.",The Guest

Or I am just too old anymore for this teenager craps 😅 The best word is awkward for this movie I think. First of all; there's nothing wrong with the acting. I'm delighted to see Dan's toned body, get it back, you are too skinny at the moment!😄
If you wanna make an 80s movie, make an 80s movie, but in the 80s. It's a common problem these days. Everyone wants an 80s Movie that takes place in the 2000s. Not going to work.
I loved the music, but made it just more awkward. I don't really know how express myself. Probably bc this movie is very messy. Shame,shame,shame.",The Guest

97,bayardhiler,Worthy Thriller With a little 80's Tribute,9,13 February 2015,"Going in, I expected 2014's ""The Guest"" to be the typical story of a mysterious stranger who turns out to be a psycho. Instead, I got a film that went for something a little different and in the process, paid tribute to the 80's slasher flicks themselves. The story begins when the mysterious but kindly David (Dan Stevens) knocks on the door of Laura Peterson, who just lost her son in the war, and claims to have known and served with him as a former soldier. Soon Laura and her family come to regard David as a member of the family. David seems like the perfect friend, he starts teaching one of the kids, Luke, how to not take crap from anyone and also starts hanging out with the Peterson's daughter, Anna (Maika Monroe), who works at the local diner and hangs out with her friends at parties like many teens do. But of course we the audience know that underneath the charm and ah shucks veneer, there's something to be afraid of and it's not long before several people in town start turning up dead. Who is David? Did he really he know the Petersons' son? And what does a covert military unit want with him?Part of the fun of ""The Guest"" is where the story ultimately takes us. Without going into too much detail, let me just say David is far more dangerous than your average killer and despite this being a low budget flick, we the audience don't doubt it. Much of this should be attributed to Dan Steven's portrayal of the character. With his charm and good manners, Stevens is able to put you at ease one minute and then make the hair on the back of your neck stand up when we see him stare off at nothing but intensely enough to melt butter whenever he's alone in his room. Plus, he does a pretty good job convincing us he can handle himself in a fight. Maika Monroe plays her part of the hot daughter who has a thing for 80's sounding synth pop and a good sense of suspicion of David admirably as well, as does everyone else in the cast, such as Lance Reddick as the covert military operative sent to take David down. But above all, ""The Guest"" is memorable because we the audience get the sense there's something different here than your average low-budget thriller. One gets a feeling there's some sort of, I guess you could say nostalgic feel to the 80's in the film especially (strangely enough) ""Halloween III: Season of the Witch"" due to the plot and also the awesome 80's/early 90's sounding synth-pop, dance soundtrack the film has. Plus, the film takes place during Halloween which kind of adds to the film a little bit as well. I can't say it's a perfect film, but for what it is, if you're looking for something that's a little different to kill time with, ""The Guest"" is an awesome thing to do it with. Also starring Brenden Meyer, Sheila Kelley, Leland Orser and Tabatha Shaun.",The Guest
98,daggersineyes,Loved it,7,18 December 2014,"Great thriller - plenty of action, nice characterisation and a great villain played brilliantly by some actor others seem to know but I've never seen before (I don't watch that Downtown Abbey or whatever it's called). I love when the bad guy is also likable and this dude was portrayed perfectly so the viewer is left feeling very conflicted about who to root for! Great production, music, directing and mostly good acting all round. Not sure what the negative reviewers are upset about but it's interesting how they are very extreme in their hate for this flick. Something got under their skin ;) If you like a good thriller this is worth watching. Sure it could probably have been improved but for my money I am happy to see something as straight forward, entertaining and unpretentious as this for a change. So refreshing.",The Guest
99,watcher2019,enjoyable nonsense,7,14 January 2020,It was off to a good start and kept me interested even if it was an old story. Got a bit silly at the end but the laughs were there all the way through. Dan stevens was great and over played the role to the hilt.,The Guest
100,stephendaxter,One of the greatest and most underrated films of 2014,9,19 February 2015,"I had put off seeing this film for quite a while, mainly because i just didn't know what to expect. And after watching it, let me just say that i cannot believe that i didn't see this earlier. I had been hearing mixed reviews about this film so i didn't expect too much, but this film blew me away and was one of the biggest surprises of 2014. I cannot believe this film got so overlooked last year as it deserved a lot more attention than it got, it is one of the most underrated movies of last year. This movie was just so mesmerising and compelling from start to finish that i was on the edge of my seat the whole time. That was a result of the combination of great directing, and amazing soundtrack and a killer performance by Dan Stevens who i can see getting more larger roles in the future after this performance. His performance reminded me of Jake Gyllenhaal's in Nightcrawler. Although not as good as Gyllenhaal's, he still managed to be such a presence while on the screen, he really transforms into the character and makes you convinced that he is a real guy. This film was also so well directed that i did not lose interest at any point during the film, the director did a great job at creating an overall tone and mysterious feel to the movie that just made it so compelling to watch. And the film was accompanied by what may be one of my favourite soundtracks of 2014, the music fit so well with the tone and the events that were happening on screen that you completely lose all sense of your surroundings and cannot look away from the screen, it just draws you in to the film. Where i felt the film could have excelled a little was having a little more action, there was a diner scene that was just awesome and you couldn't have gone wrong with a little more of that. I also thought the ending wasn't all that great, it definitely had a slightly emotional fell to it but if done differently i may have rated this a little higher. - 9",The Guest
101,asage19,stylish retro horror/thriller,8,19 July 2020,"I gave it only 8 for two things. The first is the electronic soundtrack. I get that it's because the movie is retro, but damn, the last time electronic music in a movie sounded good was in Terminator. Ever after, it's pretty much a bad idea.The second is that it is maybe a little too much of an homage to fun horror/thriller movies - too retro. It has echoes of old slasher movies like Hallowe'en, Carrie, Nightmare on Elm Street, and that's fun, but it's kind of soulless. It had a pretty good momentum building, on its own merits, without having to resort to winking at the past. In my view, it kind of diminishes what had been accomplished otherwise in the film. It became quite a bit less interesting, where potential was promised but not fully developed.That said, it is fun, it's fast, Dan Stevens is a great as usual. I'm getting the feeling that he is fairly particular in the projects that he chooses. It's a good thing :) It shows! If he's in a movie, it's going to be worth watching.I'd also like to add that I really don't think there's any subtext about how the military treats its soldiers, etc. It's a plot device, almost a kind of shorthand back story, that everyone knows and therefore needn't be explained.",The Guest
102,lnvicta,One of the most stylish and fun thrillers of the decade.,9,13 May 2015,"It's a bold statement but I stand by it. This movie had everything I wanted and a hell of a lot more. The plot in a nutshell is that a guy named David (Dan Stevens) goes to the house of a soldier who was KIA and claims to have known him personally, so the family invites him to stay. Then things start happening, secrets come out, and sh*t goes down. Simple premise, and if it sounds familiar it's probably because it's been done many times, but never quite with as much finesse as The Guest. The writer and director are the same team that brought us You're Next and a few segments from V/H/S and V/H/S/2. Personally I loved You're Next - it was a straight up horror comedy with little to no surprises. Here, the duo hone their strengths into their magnum opus so to speak. The Guest is an action thriller, but there are a lot more elements at work. It's dramatic, it's funny, it's intense, and it gets pretty frightening at times. The scope seems very wide but it all flows together without a hitch, and each emotional reaction keeps your eyes glued to the screen waiting for what happens next. The Guest is held together by its lead, Dan Stevens. I haven't seen him in anything before this but he was flawless in this role as an enigmatic, seemingly charming family friend. David is immensely likable, even when questionable things start happening you still want to root for the guy. He just has a badass aura around him. Dan Stevens plays him with such conviction that you can't see through him and you have no idea what is going on in his head, but you know that there's more to him than meets the eye.When I say sh*t goes down in this movie, I mean it. Sh*t. Goes. Down. I won't spoil anything but The Guest has one of the most stylish, suspenseful, colorful, and downright invigorating third acts in a movie I've seen in a while. It's f*cking magnificent. Some people are split on this opinion but honestly, I thought it was an absolute blast. It takes place in a Halloween fun house; as soon as it began I turned into a giddy schoolgirl. Yeah, it's just that much fun. The first two acts are impeccable as well, building up the tension and suspense to a level of tangibility that you can cut with a knife. The characters surrounding David are all great as well. They're your typical family, and although it may seem like they're just caricatures, they are completely convincing in their roles largely due to the realistic dialogue. Everything progresses believably and exactly how you'd want it to, and the predictability is a strength in this case because it gives the filmmakers a chance to make the simple premise as shiny and creative as possible. I was not bored for a minute of this movie. The soundtrack is phenomenal too - it has an '80s thriller vibe and a lot of dark electronic grooves similar to those in You're Next but even better.The Guest is an action-thriller buff's wet dream, and it even throws in some horror for good measure. It really is one of the most underrated movies of 2014 and an experience that no thriller fan should miss out on.",The Guest
103,tapio_hietamaki,An unpredictable thriller with colorful lightning,7,22 March 2017,"'The Guest' is a stereotype-defying thriller with great acting, nice action scenes and real shocker plot twists. A really unpredictable movie - at the start you can't really fathom where the story is going to go and when some secrets are revealed you still can't even guess which characters end up dead.The movie actually combines horror into its action thriller premise. The ending sequence is straight out of a 90's slasher movie.Visually the movie was endlessly pleasing. There are a lot of quiet-type characters and a lot of mystery in the air, so you have a lot of time just processing the production values. The movie takes place in a small town, not much to say about that, but the lighting and the music takes the cake. It's one of those 'neon-noir' movies like 'Drive' or 'John Wick' with colorful lightning and retro synth soundtracks and I hope they make more of this style of movie because it just works.",The Guest
104,rprince-832-6294,Creepiest movie of 2014. By far.,8,7 December 2014,"-When a soldier introduces himself to a family whose son died in action and served with him, they welcome him into their home. What follows is a string of odd activities that connect with the appearance of this suspicious guest.-This year has not been good at all for horror/suspense, but this film even makes The Babadook (one of the few good ones) look lame.-The story itself is cliché and, without spoiling anything, has a cliché twist and ending. But the way it is presented makes it still really good! -The tone is sooooooo uncomfortable. This nicest guy ever freaked me out.-The acting is good, but shout-out to the lead 'guest' in this. Yup.-The characters are realistic and kinda cliché, but they are very well developed, leaving you to really care about them.-There are not a lot of 'scares,' but the creep factor is high. The small events in it are also impossible to predict, leaving you wondering what will happen until the end. And the finally was really good too! -The film is rated-R, but only has some mild language and violence for an R film.-The Guest is an example of sticking to a formula and adding to it to make an incredible suspenseful, unpredictable, and exciting film. It's pretty gripping and is worth checking out! I'm still not sure how to rate films no longer in theaters, so I would buy The Guest at full price and give it a good 7.5/10.",The Guest
105,aliases-53334,Started great but oh boy,4,17 June 2018,"The fantastic acting and atmosphere certainly got me hooked from the start. The 80s music and vibe is brilliant and reminded me alot of It Follows, which is interesting as this is the same actress who was acting there as well.

Dan Stevens is also very different from Downton Abbey, which I guess is what he wanted to distance himself a bit from. He really has ""it"" and I would not be surprised if he pops up as the next Bond.The movie? It is kind of a B-movie but the plot is excellent and they take some stuff further then normally. I can't say what exactly, without spoiling the plot. But what I can say is that you have seen all of this before. Just not this way.It is violent and funny and not very politically correct. And yes, Dan Stevens is the bad guy and you root for him all the way. And isn't he the most charming bad guy you have ever seen he nails it! The other actors? Emmm they are OK. I dunno, they are so out shined by Dan Stevens that I cannot seem to recall them anymore. So apparently they can't have done too poor of a job.",The Guest
107,azanti0029,An odd film that has a promising start and then seems to become a 1980's horror film,5,29 December 2014,"A family living a small town recently bereaved by the loss of their son in Iraq welcomes a stranger, 'David' into their home on the basis that he trained with their son. While the latter appears to be true it appears not everything is as it seems as he begins to eliminate all the families enemies and soon is clearly one hat stand short of a rabbit hutch. British actor Dan Stevens gives a great performance as the mysterious lead in the guest and a good cast all round give their best so why does this film fall flat in the final reel? It almost appears as if its made by two directors with the second half being from an entirely different film. Realism goes out the window and we're in 1980s stalk and slash territory as the final climax takes place in a school dance fun house - really? The story was certainly an enjoyable romp for a while and there's some great supporting performances from Leland Orser, Shelia Kelley and Lance Riddick, but there not enough to save the last third of the movie. The origins and motivations of 'David' are never really made clear and we do actually need to understand in this film to have a better idea of what is going on. Some vague implication to such a critical part of the plot doesn't really cut the mustard here. The film certainly shows that Dan Stevens has a long career ahead of him, but The Guest could have been so much more inviting a prospect with a better fleshed out plot. Interesting but ultimately disappointing.",The Guest
108,magnuslhad,enjoyable pulp,7,18 January 2015,"This gleeful production entertains mightily, providing laughs, chills, schlock violence and parody in a display of confidence from assured filmmakers. In one sense this is a home invasion story akin to Pacific Heights. In another sense, it is a riff on the Bourne soldier-as-superman franchise. On one level it is also an incisive political statement on America's view of itself as 'the perfect soldier,' vowing to protect 'the home' while simultaneously destroying it. Pick the level you want to enjoy, or enjoy the mix 'n' match of the multiple references that ripple through the film. Personally, I felt it closest to Harry, He's Here to Help, another equally joyous film about unbridled malevolence. David's moment in the kitchen with the mother, under fire, is fraught with dread. His, ehm, sage advice to the son on dealing with bullies is both scary and hilarious. Dan Stevens is perfectly cast, and Maika Monroe as Anna astutely guides us through the minefield that is David's short sojourn into their home. Bold music and editing suffused with horror tropes adds to the spectacle. Great fun.",The Guest

110,zenmateisshite,A wonderful TV movie,8,12 November 2020,"I remember liking this movie when I watched it 5 years ago. It looked like a TV movie but the story was very appealing, acting well done, and directing superb. I liked it a lot, and I downloaded the soundtrack which was ""stylish"" (a word used multiple times to describe this movie by other reviewers).This movie (or this adapted short story) is really a study about psychopaths. Forget about the negative affiliations our culture has put out about psychopaths, they have been a very important step in human evolution. The Yakuza in Japan, psychopaths. The Italian mob, psychopaths. Most fortune 500 CEOs, psychopaths. The Pawnee warriors, psychopaths. Some US soldier deployed to wars in 2014, psychopaths. Most politicians, you guessed it, psychopaths.There has been an evolutionary need for someone who can switch their feelings off in order to protect their loved ones. Do you ever wonder why your lovely friendly German Shepherd can be so nice to you, but will rip the face of your enemy? This is what psychopaths do. They have a mission, to protect their loved ones.

111,Lucabrasisleeps,Entertaining but clichéd,6,19 May 2015,"I have to admit I expected somewhat of a different movie while watching this. I expected a slow burning mystery film with a serious tone. With a mind bending twist. The poster looked cool and people were raving about it so I expected something.Instead I get a predictable movie where there are no actual surprises. I mean, they really imply everything from the start. No twist is going to shock you. Considering his earlier movies like You're next, I guess I expected some more intelligent and fresh twists. This type of movie has been done countless times now. And of course the tone may be another thing that was not satisfying. The second half moves into over the top territory. It seems that the villain has definitely killed more in this movie than many other movies of the same type. I guess they didn't want the villain to be even a little sympathetic. They just go overboard and it becomes a standard Hollywood action movie which glorifies violence.The characters are clichéd and they fall into the usual problems that we have seen quite a few times in these type of movies. But thankfully there are some funny scenes which redeem the movie. Like the conversation regarding the detention. Or even the murder of one of the characters when he goes to buy a gun. Because in this movie, really nothing is serious.Dan Stevens gives a good performance in the lead role. It is one of the bright points of the movie and somehow he is able to rescue the movie from mediocrity. Another thing I liked was the soundtrack. As I am a fan of 80s music, the music at various points was a highlight. Especially in the ending.Overall I liked it. It was definitely entertaining with the shootouts and the humor. But they could have more fresh concepts and maybe a darker tone.6/10 (for the performance of Dan stevens, some humor and the soundtrack)",The Guest
112,evans-j34,7.5/10 Loved it but.....,8,16 August 2020,"I did like mainly as the lead guy is gorgeous and you want chemistry to go further between him and the girl.. but major plot holes if he really was trying to stay off the radar than rather than going around killing people mainly the guys he was suppose to just pay cash for a few guns for then he wouldnt have aroused a load of suspicion about himself prompting the daughter to check up on him. Another point that didnt make sense was to kill the mum & dad after theyd been nice to him. The secret agents already knew he was their he wasnt disposing if evidence he was creating it. Same with going after the young son & daughter in real life pointless when he would need to be escaping the town not hanging around it.. wish we couldve got a bit more out of the end too with him and the daughters fight him torn whether to kill her or feelings stopping him wouldve been better. The son stepping up was right on .. his dying scene a little cheesy.. I still all in all loved the film. Liked the soundtrack characters
He was suave, mesmerising and good as a skilled soldier killer
I will probably watch this again. I like these sort of desert countryside killer movies
Also great soundtrack. The music choice and cinematography as the daughter comes up behind him and says you killed my parents is beautiful!!! Very retro style so 80s. I've watched this film about 3 times in 24hours so definitely entertained. Sad it only made half of its budget back I put this down to not the film being bad but it not being publicized enough for release ive only just heard of it in the comment section on imdb which maybe decide to watch of it wasnt for that comment never woildve known about it.

113,sakram,A movie with no core shouldn't even make it to theatres.,4,6 August 2021,"Movie producers should think twice before spending a budget on a movie that has no core whatsoever. What I mean by core is what movie is basically based upon, relying on, the bedstone idea that is the pillar for the movie.The Guest however fails to mark itself as a rememberable movie by missing the biggest thing of all: What's the point of the movie.The start was very rushed, acting was off. The director didn't even give us a chance to get into the movie but he slammed the idea of the guest right in our faces but I was gonna be kind of alright with it if the movie had any importance at all. But it failed to deliver, failed hard.The acting was way off for most of the characters, felt like they're being paid in half to do it, except for the boy and the mother. The main character (David) seems to be forcing his cool guy persona since minute one and it was very cringy and annoying to look at. (Totally not the actor's fault, it is all bad direction).So bad direction at almost everything literally: Plot, Casting, Audio Producing, Choice of Music, and the overall storyboard. Everything feels so amateurly done and this is definitely one of the worst movies I have seen.I will be forgetting this movie within the next few hours. I don't recommend this to anyone.",The Guest

115,Richard_Alex_Jenkins,Comedy is not the same as comical,4,12 September 2016,"It's pretty obvious reading through the latest comments for this film that there's a group of people voting against negative reviews, and upvoting everything positive. So be it. But that's why it's necessary to write this review; not to slate the film as rubbish, but to give a balanced opinion.My rating went from 8 down to 5 as the film progressed. Why? Because the first 45 minutes were almost excellent - a tense, edgy, sexy and very enjoyable film. And most of all, entirely plausible, but the remainder of the film descended into pastiche... and the final 20 minutes were almost unwatchable.Some people will say it was the Director's intention to turn a very serious movie into a parody without any warning, making it retro and throwback to the 80s, but that's not what the director had in mind, I assure you. The script or storytelling simply ran out, and the film turned into a trashy A-team or 70s kung-fu movie. Quite bizarre, and not in an intentionally bizarre, twisted, strange way, like Mulholland Drive for example, but in a rubbishy lack of content sort of way.Shall I go into some of things that really bothered me, like the squad of inept, but fully armed and armoured military police, who actually machine gunned through the bed the protagonist was hiding under, only for him to roll out and shoot the assailant with his pistol. And a heavy calibre machine gun totted from the back of the truck, riddling the entire house with bullets across several rooms while the 'hero' chats to the 'mom' on the kitchen floor...I don't want to go into the film's flaws in too much detail, just to reiterate my disappointment at turning a very good film into a progressively bad film through inept directing and storytelling. What happened to the director half-way through this film? Did he feel as though he'd already done enough? I don't understand how this film transformed into two such distinct halves - really good / really bad.There you have it. Worth a watch and quite entertaining, and still worth a 5/10, but don't listen to the 8/9/10/10 people out there, or even the 1/10 people. The film isn't THAT bad, just badly ruined in the second half.",The Guest

Now he is here and that is going to be dangerous, a friend of the family comes home to his mates place with a very dark secret and that is going to be a killer. Want more, well there is a beautiful girl in the picture but that is all I'm telling as to spoil it for you isn't half the fun as not knowing anything is worse so if I get wrapped up in the show so you can too!. Now make a move so you can come home in plenty of time to collect your munchies sit in front of the television put your feet up and relax, this might be the only time you can so I rated this an A grade for the brilliant twist and turns that will have you thinking throughout the movie and watch full on entertainment right in your own home. Enjoy! Any aging film fan will tell you that they used to make them better. Films used to have characters and storyline, rather than just bombastic action. It may be true that in terms of blockbusters we are going through a period of stagnation, but look deeper into the world of indies and there are still loads of great flicks to be found. A recent year has not passed with several great new horror films in particular escaping and 'The Guest' is certainly one of these; an intelligent take on an 80s horror, but with a modern feel.",The Guest
117,MattBirk,The Guest - The Best Hidden Gem of 2014,8,7 January 2015,"The Guest just might be the 'coolest' movie of the year, it certainly features one of the coolest characters of the year, David. The movie has style to spare, from the vibrant lighting, to the retro soundtrack, the movie is easy on the eyes and ears, it's flat out amazing. The soundtrack being the high-point of the film, an a ray of synthesized songs that makes the movie something special. All the technical aspects of the film are more than covered, they are the highlight of the film, and the acting coming from Dan Stevens and Maika Monroe is great. The story revolves around the cryptic character, David, who stays with the family of a fallen soldier and subtly begins imposing his will on their lives. It's great to see the director know how to handle the material and shift the viewer's opinion of David back and forth, he's shown as the coolest guy at the party, he can do anything and everything, but at the same time you are shown darker glimpses of him that create some type of doubt. It's this doubt that carries the movie along, at first David is the saving grace of the family, he's solving their problems one at a time, but then things slowly start to change for the worse.Is he who he says he is, is he really there to help, did he really serve with their son/brother, is all of this too good to be true? All these questions remain hidden until the end and rather than take the conventional route with this type of story, the movie takes a somewhat bizarre turn as it reveals what David's motives are and who he is. Though I can imagine some people might have a problem with how light the movie is with the details of who he is, I certainly had no problem with it whatsoever. I loved just about every single minute in the movie, other than the mother who takes open arms to new heights, this is how low budget thrillers should be. As I said above, the retro soundtrack and directing style coming from Adam Wingard is nothing short of spectacular. This is one of the best hidden gems of the year and sure to gain a very solid cult following as the years go by!",The Guest

This guy is like Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt conjoined in one evil performance. How did they fail so bad in the ending? What happened? It begins as an A movie with a B budget and ends with a C ending. If only they would have included just a bit more Bourne no problem. A flashback here, a super soldier/spy injection there. But no. No, they had to ruin it.

119,AleksandrBelenko,"Came for soundtrack, stayed for the plot",9,14 December 2019,I am a great fan of industrial music so when I found out that there is the soundtrack by DAF and also some gothic rock bands I knew I have to watch it. Moreover the main character is portrayed by Dan Stevens that I loved in Legion. So I found the movie the next day and oh boy it is good. The secret of his personality is not revealed till the end. And the finale is a thrilling action. I am just careful not to spoil anything that much I think it is great to advise to all the people.,The Guest
120,jimlacy2003,"Entertaining, could have been better",7,29 December 2014,"This movie is a pretty fun psychological thriller type genre movie.The plot is someone typical and predictable, you've probably seen the same elements many times before, yet not detracting from the overall fun of it.It would have been better if it where not for the bad climatic scenes. Either the writer(s) ran out of ideas, and, or, they didn't have the budget, it looked really cheap and didn't make a lot of sense. For one thing here you are supposed to have some sort of elite top secret division and they send out what had to be the dumbest (maybe rookie) soldiers out on the climatic mission. The worst of it they were over the top emotional types that you would obviously not see as a trained solider let alone a special forces operative.And through out the end was this cheesy 80's music. Maybe it's supposed to tie in things to the 80's, but since it was already stereotyped enough it just made things worse.Above average, not a bad movie to watch, it just could have been a lot better had they put more thought and work into the later part of the movie..",The Guest

122,mycannonball,Funny throwback to 80s thrillers,8,9 June 2015,"After a slow opening 20 minutes, this movie does pick up the pace and it turned out to be highly entertaining. However, you can't take it too seriously, and I think this was the filmmakers' intention as well. Occasionally, a character's action doesn't make total sense but this movie is about suspending disbelief and it's a fun ride that made me laugh.The way that Dan Steven's played the main character was great. The interactions between the son and David's provided a great dynamic. David's utter seriousness, intensity, and ultimately craziness played up against the kid's reactions were hilarious. There were a lot of fun scenes that were throwbacks to 80s thrillers and at times, the movie had great suspense and tension.",The Guest

124,georgecoffeynewyorker,Captivating Audience. Amazeballs,9,14 September 2014,"Well what a film this was. We were treated to gore, and excitement. My heart pumping like mad. It was unreal. My friend who joined me wasn't that impressed. Oh and another extra that I was impressed was the HOTNESS of Dan Stevens the guy who played David. The plot was the only thing that I could fault. The only thing I got from the plot was, that a guy(Stevens) came to a house from the war. He claimed that he was at war with Caleb a guy who had died in the war or something. He stayed with a family. Mom(Sheila), Luke(Meyer), Anna(Monroe), Dad(Orser),Major Carver(Reddick), Kristen(Shaun). From what I could gather, David moved in with the family. He stood up for the family, helped them out etc., etc., I was most intrigued with the Hate Crime. How this came about, was that Luke was looking something up on Lappy. Then a jackass of a bigot, called him a ""faggot"". He didn't take heed of it. However when the bully saw that he was looking up Plastic surgery, he accused Luke of wanting a sex change. So he beat up the jock/bigot/bully. And of course there was punishment to be sentenced. So then the principal wanted to expel him for ""zero tolerance violent"". However David was quick to point out, ""Luke, what did the kid call you"". The princeipal trying to dismiss the whole thing ""I believe faggot was used"". He literally preached Hate Crime. I'm most impressed. Great action, no question. There was a bit gore alrite, but nothing major to report. However that said, we still don't know what exactly he was. We were left all puzzled, at the end when there was a confrontation between Luke, Anna and David, Luke stabbed David several times. I would and the rest of us would agree, that he would have died. However, we saw him coming out as a fireman, when an Official fireman said that there were only 2 Bodies found. The School guy and the Black guy as I call him but as it happens it was the Major Carver. Firstly he does a great job of standing up for Luke initially. By ordering them Cosmopolitans(apparently a gay drink, something like that), and Blowjob.....for the girls. So he beats them up. Then next Anna invites(with hesitation) to a party. Anna's friend Kristen's ex, makes trouble, however David helps out. Then later on, the baddiness of him occurs. As I said above, a confrontation occurs between Major Carver and himself. So yeah great action, no doubt.",The Guest
125,DogFilmCritic,What If universal soldier was a horror movie,6,22 February 2016,"I have to admit this is a step forward from ""Your next"" making a far more interesting story, as its pretty common for army vets to keep in touch after service. It had very good characters ""David"" was a creepy likable guy, the other characters were good, the younger brother felt like a hidden sociopath at times, the sister was a unlikely hero but did OK. The one thing to me that stands out its the soundtrack...it was just amazing you can see the John Charpenter influence in it. As the story goes it has some twist and turns that were enjoyable and i wish they could have spill a bit more on the project but one can assume some pretty good ideas of what was going on...hit the title, still i cant say its all great, it suffers from needing more, the story could do better, specially with the stereotypical bullies and the use from the F word and i mean the other F word the one that can felt you in deep trouble...i hope the director follows this path up and come up with more creative movies, i recommend it not that great but not as bad.",The Guest
126,kevinmorice,My brain hurts,5,7 September 2014,"OK, I gave it a few hours before I posted this because I thought I might have missed something. Maybe it is like Pulp Fiction where it seems like a disjointed mess, but when someone tells you the key suddenly it slots together and makes sense. But it isn't. It is just a confused mess. It does homage some 80's movie styling, right from the opening credits there is a hint of something between Halloween and the Wraith. The music is good. But then the holes are huge. The story doesn't make sense! He turns up and they just take him in. Once the daughter figures out he is a fake everyone just ignores it. It turns out he is 'just' some random psychopath but part of his problem is that he kills anyone that knows who he is? Half a dozen trained soldiers turn up but are completely incompetent to the point that my girlfriend was complaining about their lack of basic soldiering skills. And what was with the weird tilting guns when turning corners thing that they were all doing?And of course he survives at the end and none of them can count to three when removing the bodies? Really?!",The Guest

It has a very retro '80's Halloween slasher vibe but isn't dated in the least.",The Guest
128,DVR_Brale,Super entertaining with slick soundtrack and superb acting by Stevens,7,6 February 2019,"I stumbled upon this movie accidentally while watching TV and decided to give it a shot since there was nothing better on. I would have probably never decided to watch it deliberately because of the unsavory topic. And that would be a mistake.Two things really stand out in this movie: Dan Stevens' acting and soundtrack. Stevenson plays this super calm and, as you can guess from the beginning, highly trained soldier who one day just shows up at the doorstep of some family who had lost their son in combat. He tells the mother how he knew her son, gets acquainted with the family and stays with them. Here you can see how good has Stevens pulled out this role (David): he was successful at being mysterious and somehow at the same time pretty familiar in a sense of having something familiarly odd about him. Throughout the first half you are never completely sure about who David is, what his plans are, is he a good or a bad guy and yet you know something will go wrong. You can smell that he's probably dangerous and that he takes advantage od family's sorrow. This creates tension which keeps the movie going and leads to paroxysm in which you finally meet real David and see what he's capable of and, very importantly, why he is capable of those things.Soundtrack is slick and helps to give a finishing touch. Annies' 'Anthonio' Berlin breakdown version playing in some scenes is hard for me to get out of head. This movie proves that great soundtrack can make up for superficial plot and make movie much more enjoyable and smooth. Plus, songs playing match David's character and make him look more as deus ex machina and a helping nice guy he purportedly is.Given the perspective a viewer has, which is, unlike main protagonists, that of having all information about what's happening, The Guest is very entertaining to watch coupled with great soundtrack. Don't expect something special or deep and you're surely have fun watching it. Even the critics gave this movie high rating which rarely happens with this genre. Hope I got you at least a little interested in seeing it!",The Guest
129,MovieSonic,Loved it!,8,21 December 2014,"So this was awesome!As someone has already pointed out, this had a great retro feel with lots of well-timed humour and great acting all-round. I loved the fact that they didn't hold back like so many films do today. The kill scenes were crisp and clear, the lead (and supporting) actors were a pleasure to watch and the music was genius.Some of the story aspect falters a bit but that doesn't really matter because cutting some development out keeps the story from meandering.The setting for the final fight scene was staged superbly and was really quite beautiful and although the absolute final scene will annoy some people (e.g. me), I'm definitely hoping for a sequel. Maybe a prequel would be better though?A must-watch for fans of this genre.8/10",The Guest
130,Cinema_Love,6.7/10 only ????,9,18 November 2015,"The Guest is one hell of a ride.How to describe all of this ? Drama, Action, Comedy, Horror, Thriller...You cannot say it's either one of them, it's all of them at once.Dan Stevens (Downtown Abbey), Maïka Monroe (It Follow), Sheila Kelley (L.A. Law), the excellent and underrated Leland Orser (Taken trilogy) as the daddy all star in this amazing film directed by the talented Adam Wingard (You're Next).The idea is as you read on this site: ''A soldier introduces himself to the Peterson family, claiming to be a friend of their son who died in action. After the young man is welcomed into their home, a series of accidental deaths seem to be connected to his presence.'' But how all of this happen is just... wow too much amazing.

132,Krackoon,Adam Wingard/Simon Barrett Do it Again!,9,25 July 2015,"The combination of Wingard/Barrett is quickly turning into a horror favorite.In 2013 they finally released 'You're Next,' which turned out to be one of my favorite horror films in recent years. So, when I heard about 'The Guest,' it was probably my most anticipated film of 2014. However, after reading more about the plot, I had my doubts. It's the type of material that could go horribly wrong very quickly - not to mention, it puts a huge load on your villain's shoulders. If Dan Stevens didn't live up to expectations, the material wouldn't mean a thing. Finding the 'right guy' to play your villain, in my opinion, is just as important as writing good material. This has killed several films, not just horror.Well, Dan Stevens didn't only live up to expectations, he went above and beyond. ''David'' ends up being the type of bad ass that simply doesn't come along enough in any genre, much less horror. His mannerisms, facial expressions, line delivery were all top notch. This guy came from television? It doesn't show. He and John Wick get my vote for bad asses of the year. Random Ramblings of a Madman: ''David'' ranks right up there with my all-time favorite movie villains - He's a guy who tries to do something good, but when it doesn't work out, he really doesn't give a damn. Watching Dan Stevens play this character, is about as fun as watching Rutger Hauer's ''Hitcher'' character. Both characters are completely misunderstood, which is a shame, because both characters expressions and mannerisms play a huge part in the films plot. I've seen people claim 'The Guest' is ''the worst film ever,'' and ''ridiculous.'' These people missed the point, obviously - but hopefully Wingard/Barrett pay more attention to the critics praises, because they're on a roll, and I'm already waiting for their next film. If you guys read this - Thanks for making the genre fun again.",The Guest
133,NileFortnerBoogieBuddha954,"Returning from combat operations in Afghanistan, soldier David, visits the family of a dead comrade, and is invited to stay. But is David everything he claims to be?",9,20 July 2016,"So what's next for the makers of the film You're Next? Some might expect another horror film from Adam Wingard and screenwriter Simon Barrett. I believe we get more than just another horror film. Imagine if John Carpenter's Halloween, The Terminator, You're Next, and Drive all found a way to mix up into one badass, bold, and a blast of a movie. We would get The GUEST!This film was great, I believe it should have had a wide release.The plot of the film is, Spencer, played by Leland Orser (The Taken Trilogy) and Laura Peterson, played by Sheila Kelley (Pure Luck) with their children Luke, played by Brendan Meyer (Tooth Fairy) and Anna, played by Maika Monroe (It Follows, Independence Day: Resurgence) are coping up with the loss of their eldest son, Caleb, to the war in Afghanistan. They are visited by David Collins, played by Dan Stevens (A Walk Among the Tombstones, upcoming live action Beauty and the Beast) who claims to be a former soldier and Caleb's best friend. He announces to the family his reason of visit; to help Caleb take care of the family. David is polite, warm and friendly toward the family, and Laura offers to let him stay as long as he needs to. But as time goes on, Anna becomes suspicious of David. Is David really a friend of the family? Is he really who he says he is? Only time, tears, and bloodshed will tell.The acting throughout the film is really good. You can sense the unhappiness, and tension in the Peterson household from the first scene. Dan Stevens has been great in every project he has been in so far. In the beginning, he really does come off like a polite, well spoken, mannered, all American, handsome good boy war veteran. As the film goes on, he becomes literally like The Terminator. He becomes cold, lifeless, angry, and strange.Maika Monroe does an amazing job as well. Not only is she sizzling with all kinds of sexy, and badassery. She delivers a character we can really get behind. At first, I thought her character was a typical teenager. Meaning, she acts like she knows so much more than everyone else (not all teens act like this). However, we really do start to see things from her way. In my opinion, this should have been the breakout role for Maika Monroe, not It Follows.Accordingly, this film has various stylistic choices, and Adam Wingard respects all the stylistic choices. Mainly with the editing, and score. I personally like the score. It is a great throwback, to the '70s and '80s. I believe mainstream audiences may find the score to be odd. But hardcore film fans, especially fans who know the '70s and '80s, will really appreciate and respect the score.So these are my final Bitchin' Buddha thoughts on The Guest. I give this film a high grade, even though it was on a low budget. A terrific throwback to the '70s/'80s grindhouse and 80s direct to video movies. It was a surprise hit, and I believe it is one of the biggest hits of 2014. We don't get to many films like this, and I'm glad we got one that is this well done. This is more than just a great film to watch on Halloween, but a great film to see any time of the year. It's timeless with terror, timeless with a great score, and timeless in fun. I believe The Guest earns a...9/10!This review is brought to you by Boogie Buddha, and remember don't just get down, but get Boogie. Thank you for reading, and/or viewing, and i hope you have an amazing day as always. :)",The Guest

138,BillSims28,Five Word Review: Non-stop Retro Enjoyability; Fantastically Unique,10,7 November 2015,"Adam Wingard, director of cult 2013 horror You're Next, helms this stunningly original, thoroughly entertaining surprise in which the Peterson family (including Maika Monroe, It Follows), grieving the loss of their recently deceased army son/brother Caleb, are visited by a mysterious young man called David (Dan Stevens, Downton Abbey) who was a friend of Caleb. However, whilst things seem to look up after the introduction of David to their lives, all is not as it seems. That is actually more than you need to know about The Guest. If you've not watched it yet, you just should right now. There won't be spoilers in this review, but the less you know about it the better you'll find it. All I knew prior to watching it was that Dan Stevens acted well. And he really does, amongst a host of other overwhelming positives. It's hard to pin down this film to a particular genre. It's structured as something of a horror film, and definitely feels like it, but there's a prevailing feel of thriller in there, all balanced out by a rich vein of retro 80s action. If I were to describe its particular style, I'd say it's like a blend of Drive, The Terminator and Hotline Miami, all spun into a very unique, and deliberately silly, tongue-in-cheek film. One of my favourite things about it is the spectacular soundtrack, with hypnotic retro synth that perfectly fit the bloody violence of Hotline Miami and Drive and now this too. I downloaded all the music straight to my phone and haven't looked back since. The performances all really fit their characters well, with the Petersons all relatable and full of humanity while on the completely other hand Stevens' David is a charismatic but off-putting creation who commands a compelling screen presence.I can't talk about too much without giving anything away, but I can't enough stress how much I liked The Guest. The final third is very different in tone to the beginning and middle, which many found jarring, but I really appreciated the change in tone from horror to tongue-in-cheek retro action. Sections involving a US General seem a little unnecessary and do not fit with the rest of the film, appearing as if added in to try and explain things to the audience, but apart from this The Guest is 100% enjoyable entertainment which will command your full attention and focus. Even in scenes where nothing is happening, the assured direction and Simon Barrett's fantastic, witty script ensure that these scenes are easily as exciting as any of the others in the film. The most shiny of 2014's hidden gems; a wonderful surprise and brilliantly entertaining. One of my favourite 2014 films. 93/100",The Guest
139,sickofenjoyingmyself,"Dark humoured, mysterious, ridiculous thriller",7,2 January 2016,"The guest is an easy watching and enjoyable thriller. The concept behind the story line is not exactly original but it does deliver thanks to some fantastic performances, suitably placed dark humour and a frankly ridiculous yet highly enjoyable 80's style electronic soundtrack. Dan Stevens is equally menacing and charming. His reactions to the people around him are dark humoured yet unsettling. He keeps us guessing as to whether something important will be revealed or not about his character and I am pleased to say that something important is indeed revealed which leads to a highly satisfying all out action finale in a surprisingly well made high school haunted house. There is something utterly fantastic about the entire movie that makes it the kind you would want to watch again. Great stuff.",The Guest

The film is slowly building up its tension to a disturbing and suspenseful final with violently badass actions, solid performance, well chosen music, up to a smartly twisted climax. The film gets bloody as it goes with nothing gross or GORY but rather more disturbing and will probably SCARE you the next time you let some stranger into your house.

I watched this movie once when it first came out. It's June 24th 2020 now and I found it on Netflix. And I didn't remember a single thing. It's pure genius. It's like watching an 80's film. Not for everyone. Which is ok. But don't down people and say they have no taste. I'm sure there's movies you have seen that I don't like. Or others don't like. But if you havnt watched this movie. Give it a try. Has an awesome soundtrack as well. Also I see alot of people saying it's predictable.....which obviously the synopsis pretty much tells you what's gonna happen....for the most part.....but bravo for being able to read and booooo for feeling like your predicted the movie on your own. Just enjoy something instead of taking it so dang serious. Your negative reviews bore the people that love this movie. Anything below a 7 digging the movie got a thumbs down from me. P.s.

143,keyope,Great first act but then falls flat,6,17 November 2014,"I watched this because from the trailer it looked a bit like the movie Drive. And for the first half an hour it is basically Drive 2. From the mysterious yet likable leading man to the endless orange and blue colour schemes and the 80's synth pop soundtrack it feels just like Drive, but with a little more pace. But then right on the half hour mark the questions posed by the opening act start getting answered and act 2 moves from feeling like Drive to Universal Soldier. A decent scene with the headmaster in the kid's high school saves the second act from being a total disaster but then comes the 3rd act.... The final showdown was a huge disappointment. It felt like watching the final half hour of a Halloween or Friday the 13th sequel (i.e. the bad ones). From being an excellently acted and atmospheric small movie The Guest transforms into an all out ridiculous shoot out where FBI type agents are firing machine guns ""A Team style"" at everything. Although I admire the way the genre shifts from one act to the next, unfortunately only the first act was any good. And that's what's so sad about this film because the first act was brilliant. I thought I was watching a classic but then it just lurched from one cliché to another until the ludicrous ending. I would watch something by this director again because there's real potential shown in this movie, it's just a crushing shame about the last hour.",The Guest

It's not a ""good"" film in the conventional sense. The movie is so campy, but it's beautifully campy, I can't remember the last time I saw a movie that did campy so right. The movie starts outs just with an obvious touch of suspense and mystery. The movie feels realistic and normal in the beginning. But ever so gradually the movie morphs into a ridiculous and hilarious slasher flick.The movie has great pacing, actors who are just right for this kind of movie, the plot has just the right amount of not-quite-plot-holes.

146,ConsistentlyFalconer,"Fun, semi-nostalgic horror/thriller with an identity crisis.",7,11 July 2015,"The Guest (2014)Troubled family is visited by guy claiming to be an army friend of their deceased son... but is he what he appears to be?It's not exactly fresh ground, plotwise, but that's not necessarily a problem when a film's well made... and this is pretty good. The horror/thriller elements certainly work really well, with director Adam Wingard creating an atmosphere that's both modern and reminiscent of classic 70s and 80s slashers. Unfortunately, the action scenes just stick out like a sore thumb - with so many different camera tricks being used it feels like I'm watching an editor's showreel rather than a part of the rest of the film. Certainly this film never quite matches the consistency of Wingard's previous gem You're Next (2011).Steve Moore's score doesn't always fit, either, which is a shame as it sounds great - just doesn't always work with the film!Despite these misgivings, however, it's good fun. Leland Orser has fun playing a pathetically disposable husband; Brendan Meyer handles a difficult role very well; Dan Stevens is likable and threatening, even though he slightly overcooks his Ryan Gosling in Drive impression; but the standout performance is by Maika Monroe - check out her superb turn in 2015's It Follows, too.Verdict: a respectable addition to the low-budget semi-nostalgic horror/thriller genre.yetanotherfilmreviewblog.tumblr.com",The Guest
147,ron-fernandez-pittsburgh,Could have been......,3,16 January 2015,"The premise of THE GUEST is pretty good, but the execution not so good. What could have been a good thriller sadly goes downhill towards the end. A pity. Pretty good performances, especially from Dan Stevens. He does well with a difficult role. Good guy/bad guy. That's the problem. The screenplay doesn't seem to know what to do the his character. A good first half doesn't make for a totally satisfying movie. Just wish the writers would have been a little more original. That school Halloween seen was very unbelievable. What school has that kind of set-up for a Halloween party? It just cheapened the film and turned it from a good thriller to a slasher/horror movie. Too bad as it had a lot going for it for a while. SPOILER ALERT: The killing of the parents was the big mistake. Better to have helped the family as promised and then moved on, regardless of the daughter's interference. Brought the film down, down, DOWN. But even worse was the very end with ""David"" walking out disguised as a firefighter!!! Give us a break. Unless, of course, he was a robot!! And if so, the audience should have been clued in. Otherwise it was just too unrealistic. Shot three times, stabbed twice and off he goes!!! Big mistake folks. For these reasons I do not recommend THE GUEST. This movie only played one week in one Theatre in Pittsburgh. I can see why.",The Guest

149,pandabat,Uneven and inconsistent,5,23 December 2014,"This movie actually starts off pretty well and, despite the obvious simplicity of the plot, does draw you in. The cast are pretty good (when not being directed to be deliberately terrible in homage to cheap 70s/80s straight-to-video movies) but the story and film-making slowly get worse and worse. The action scenes lack proper continuity (""Ooooh but they're supposed to be that way"", I hear some cry) which removes any suspended disbelief and the whole tone of the movie (soundtrack included) seems to step back in time for the final act. I wanted to like it and it has some good moments but in the end we were just asking ourselves ""How in the name of all that is good did this movie score so highly?"". It's middling at best!",The Guest
150,f-rabit,Very Bad,2,20 December 2014,"The idea is not original. In fact I saw a movie with a very similar story (although a little better and more convincing) last year. The plot is a boring. The actors are boring. Too predictable story. You can't get involved or minimally interested by what is happening with the characters.You Cannot understand the bad boy behavior reasons. There's no catch in here. There's nothing to get. Again no need to fill 10 rows to say this is the worst movie of the year. A bad class B. This time I'm really puzzled by the average of the votes. I can not understand. Maybe they liked the soundtrack. Yes, it's the only interesting thing in the film and the reason why I attribute it a 2 not a 1.

152,haphazard72,Great thriller!,8,23 January 2015,"Just watched it last night- great movie! Let's be clear up front, this is not an Academy Award winning movie, however it is a great thriller with an interesting story.Dan Stevens plays a seriously cool baddie! The role suited him fantastically. The other actors were good- Maika Monroe played her part equally well (and let's be honest, she's not hard to look at!), as did Brendan Meyer.The odd one out is Leland Orser- he seems better suited to a baddie or a slick used car salesman...However, for me, the standout to this movie which really ""made it"" was the soundtrack. I loved this soundtrack and have already downloaded. Well worth the listen.The movie reminds me of some of the great 80's horror/thrillers, especially with the soundtrack.Got a bit of time to spare? Watch this....",The Guest

It had potential, but went completely off the rails when the head of the military police shows up with the best assassin and sharpshooters in the state. DAVID literally kills every one of these supposed elite soldiers in less than two minutes. He is a ""medical experiment"" gone wrong and programmed to kill anyone who finds out. Roll eyes here.

154,CharlieGreenCG,Amazing!,10,6 January 2015,"Since his departure from TV's Downton Abbey, Dan Stevens has made quite a name for himself and shown his vast abilities. Firstly, in revenge thriller A Walk Among The Tombstones alongside Liam Neeson. Now, The Guest, one of the most-underrated films of the year, but one that is easily in our top five films of 2014.The film sees a solider called David (Dan Stevens) introduce himself to the Peterson family, claiming to be a friend of their son who recently died in action. Since his arrival - and welcome into their home - a series of deaths seem to be related to his presence.It's a masterful combination of mystery, thriller and horror. But, perfectly balanced with humour. Think the Terminator meets The Bourne Identity and you are on the right pitch of the film. Except it is not so much the terminator is attempting to kill you, but move in with you!Directed by Adam Wingard, (You're Next) and teamed with writer Simon Barrett, the film is a thrill-ride of suspense; dark humour and action. Presented with a Drive-esqe superb soundtrack, The Guest is retro-fitted to the stereotypical B-movie horrors of the 1980's – yet, so much cooler.Certainly, Dan Stevens's performance is the main selling point. It's hard for characters to resist his magnetism – until you see his Ice- Cube type intimidation stare. It is absolutely mesmerizing, and our most recommended film of the year.",The Guest
155,masonmorgan-92917,A fun popcorn flick,7,1 November 2016,"Showcased in You're Next, Adam Wingard has already found his style and has further adopted this look for his second film, The Guest.This movie oozes 80's action/horror. If that's your thing then you don't even need to read the rest of this review. Trust me, you'll love it. Now when I decided to watch the film for the first time, I had some idea of what I was getting into. A fan of Wingard's previous film, You're next, I really wanted to check this one out, expecting another brutally fun and addictive popcorn flick. After watching The Guest, I know for a fact that Wingard will become the king of the cult popcorn flick. To start, the acting was all over the place. Our main character played by Dan Stevens (discount Bradley Cooper) was awesome. Stevens did a fantastic job of creating an unpredictable, shifty yet lovable stranger. The range that this actor covers in the role is very impressive. The same goes for Maika Monroe playing the film's punk teen. She managed to be the only believable character in the film, in fact. The rest of the characters were either poorly acted, underdeveloped or just cliché and dull. Despite this, Stevens performance alone is honestly reason enough to watch the movie. So I should mention that the entire first and second act of this movie is cookie cutter and predictable. I could predict possible scenes before they even happened in the movie and this trend continues for well over half the film. It's kind of sad to say that The Guest only really becomes decent after the first half. Many would disagree as I have seen the majority say the second half is dull, but I found the movie enjoyable when it actually decided to grow a pair. After the hour long cliché that is the first half, we are finally gifted something fun and generally more enjoyable to watch. Steven's character is flipped on his head and the movie turns into an actually good modern Terminator film.Dropping randoms left and right, the last third of the film shows Steven's character engage in a brutal, and quite shocking, killing spree. This is what I meant by ""growing a pair"". The movie finally decided to give us what we all really wanted, some awesome action and thrills. I was having an absolute blast with The Guest from this point up until the end. The final set piece is creative and very, very cool. I also appreciated the ending as well, but I seem to be in the minority for that.Now you simply cannot talk about The Guest without mentioning the music. The music is incentive enough to go see the film or at least check out the soundtrack. Ranging from slow dance pop to John Carpenter synths, the music is a character of its own and while it was always in your face, it never felt unwelcome.The Guest is a fun popcorn flick but nothing more. Ultimately, the awesome action and thrills of the third act outweigh the awful and predictable first two acts, making this movie recommendable, but not without a warning.",The Guest

158,wricketts,I Guest Not,3,16 August 2015,"Starts out looking like a serviceable and promising—if perhaps not hugely imaginative—psychological thriller, and Dan Stevens' ever- shifting facial expressions are a neat bit of foreshadowing. In the last half, however, the film deteriorates into a silly, heavy- handed, overwrought teen-slasher pic with outlandish splatter effects and a ""monster"" who, although stabbed and shot, cannot be killed. The fact that the writers never bother to explain the nature of the top- secret program—of which David (Dan Stevens' character) is supposedly both an alumnus and an escapee—is a major (and foolish) bit of clumping amateurism. As the film progresses, David looks seedier and seedier until there's not the slightest credibility left that he could fool anyone about his true nature or intentions. Lance Reddick turns in the most wooden (or simply arthritic), 70s-style performance of his career, and you will need nerves of steel to avoid bursting into giggles as you watch him pretend to lead a SWAT team or fire a gun. Given the promising setup and first 30 minutes, the film is a major disappointment.",The Guest

160,BrentHankins,"Dan Stevens is great, and the third act is insane.",8,17 September 2014,"Director Adam Wingard and writer Simon Barrett have made quite a name for themselves over the past few years, responsible for such genre offerings as V/H/S and last year's stellar You're Next. Their latest film, The Guest, serves as a nice change of pace, scrapping the straight-up horror elements of their past few flicks in favor of a slow-burn thriller that hearkens back to '80s action fare.David (Dan Stevens) is a recently discharged Army veteran who appears on the doorstep of the Peterson family, fulfilling the promise of a fallen comrade to check up on his parents and siblings. Still mourning the loss of their son, the Petersons welcome David into their home, where he quickly assimilates himself into their daily routine. Shy, awkward Luke (Brendan Meyer) takes an immediate liking to David, but eldest daughter Anna (Maika Monroe) sense that something is amiss.As Anna begins digging into his background, she finds plenty of problems with David's story about his past. Indeed, the polite, mild-mannered soldier who addresses everyone as ""sir"" and ""ma'am"" definitely seems to be hiding something, and a phone call to the military base from which David was discharged results in a startling discovery that may put the entire Peterson clan in danger.The entire experience works so well thanks to Stevens, who portrays David as a better-looking, more sincere version of Ryan Gosling's character in Drive. Stevens has a genuine warmth to him, which finds us willing to forgive the frequent, savage outbursts of violence. He's so incredibly likable that no matter how bad he may seem, we still don't really want to hate him.With its electro-synth score and ever-increasing tension, The Guest has a distinct John Carpenter vibe. Indeed, in a recent interview Wingard admitted that he wanted to follow a structure similar to Carpenter's Halloween - which he mostly adheres to, before the third act finds the film wandering out of action thriller territory and striding confidently, purposefully into the ""WTF"" zone. Once again, the creative duo deftly handles the dramatic shift in tone, making sure their narrative always stays a step or two ahead of the audience.",The Guest

For sure we need to talk about David, but if you are coming to this movie with preconceived ideas about what David is or is not about...well, you are in for a little surprise.But worry you not because, to some extent, you are indeed right. David had a fuse blown a while ago. However, I cannot help but blaming the supposedly good characters for it. Believe me when I tell, because if you watch this movie with your head out of the box, that things could be a whole lot different if, for all that David does for others, he could get a bit of help himself.If you liked the dark streets of Drive and its 80s music, you are going to love the second part of this movie. If you enjoyed The Bourne Identity, there is a bit of it too. A bit is what you are going to get, because for all the potential this movie could deliver, and it could definitely be a game changer in the genre, at the peak of it all it trips all over itself and it ends up with far too many loose ends, tied all up in the easiest, fastest way possible, which is a shame.But if you can forgive the lack of story development, and more importantly if you can give David a bit of empathy, you may end up watching a completely different movie than others did, because in my movie David is a real nice guy who gets the middle finger and it is asked to bend over far too many times......and do you know what happens when you bend something too much? It breaks.",The Guest
166,dgl1199,Old school style but has issues,6,26 July 2018,"I really enjoyed this film. As so many others have previously remarked it has a retro feel to it harkening back to 1980s thrillers complete with campy, synthesized music. It is also unmistakably inspired by Halloween as the holiday is the backdrop of the movie with tacky decorations in nearly every scene. But the film isn't about the style or the inspiration, it's about the mystery and the tension. David Collins is a recently discharged soldier who suddenly appears at the home of his army buddy, Caleb Peterson, who died in Iraq. Collins explains to his Caleb's mother, Mrs. Peterson, that he promised Caleb he would check on his family should he die. With his affable charm and simple, direct yet respectful way of communication David is taken in by the Peterson family and soon treated as one of their own. Even though there an enigmatic vibe about Collins he also demonstrates a protective nature for the family. However, a series of strange events and unsolved deaths in the small town slowly (and I do mean slowly) ensue which catch the attention of Caleb's sister, once a potential love interest, who grows increasingly alarmed about Collins's activities. There are also several clues dropped that Collins is not who he says he is. Her suspicions inspire her to makes some inquiries with the government about David Collins. Once his location is made known to a certain shadowy organization within the military they mobilize to apprehend him. From there all hell breaks loose. Dan Stevens was fantastic in this. From the start you don't know whether to like him, fear him, trust him, but he does capture your attention and keep it throughout the film. Because you know he has a secret. I think of him as Michael Meyers with dialogue and without the Shatner mask. I have two problems with The Guest. First is the pacing, it is at places very dull and unmoving. But the real problem I have is the development of Collins. By the time it is established that he isn't David Collins but rather an escaped participant from a military project gone awry we want to know more but are denied. We are given only scraps of supporting information about his past and his motivations. For example, it is never really made plain why he appeared at Caleb Peterson's home to begin with other than a passing line about his mission, whatever that means. Other plot and character developments are left hanging such as his plastic surgery, who was the real David Collins, and who is he really? What is HIS real name? Who is the guy he now looks like it in the photo with Caleb and his unit? It's all very confusing and frustrating. I understand it was deliberate choice by the director to leave his character to a certain extent ambiguous but it seems to go too far. Whatever happened to Collins, or whoever he is, during this military project is tied directly to the actions in this film. It doesn't make a lot of sense to deprive the viewer with at least a decent amount of cogent knowledge to support what's happening in the plot. Anyway, it is a decent thriller. Not perfect, not entirely satisfying, but good enough that I watched it twice to see if I missed anything about who Collins really is. Nope, still in the dark about that.",The Guest
167,stephenpaultaylor,"Stylish, Sexy, Scintillating and Sometimes Scary",8,24 December 2015,"The Guest is a gripping, stylish thriller with enough scares and surprises to keep you on the edge of your seat. It was a little paint-by-numbers in terms of the overall story, which might explain its rating, but I found that it kept me entranced, curious and entertained.I don't want to give away too much, but the basic premise is that an old army buddy of a soldier who died in action returns to his dead comrade's home. At first, he seems to be a sexy, soft-spoken, helpful, charming and likable new addition to their family, but when people start to die in unusual circumstances, questions about this stranger emerge. Along with the questions comes a heavy dose of suspicion and the drama unfolds. The cinematography is gorgeous. The soundtrack is very Eighties (ala. Drive). The acting is top notch (especially Dan Stevens and newcomer Maika Monroe - who was also fantastic in ""It Follows""). Some of the fight scenes are slightly cartoonish, but you get the feeling that the director is infusing these scenes with intentional campiness. The shots are slightly sped up in these scenes and the choreography is reminiscent of Guy Ritchie. The movie is intense. My one complaint is that the plot isn't terribly original, but it still manages to be both gripping and wildly entertaining. There is also something a bit tongue-in-cheek about a lot of the movie. There is a comedic underpinning to many of the scenes and dialogue. The baddie oozes so much charm (as with many psychopaths) that it's fascinating to watch him transform. Not a ""great"" movie, but a very good movie with a lot of style and a wonderful, synthy, Eighties-style soundtrack. In my books, It's definitely worth a look. I gave it 8/10",The Guest
168,MikeWright75,"Good beginning , weak ending. SPOILERS",10,15 November 2014,"Well paced at the beginning, with Dan Stevens being suitably charming and sinister, and plausible. Steven's work in Downton Abbey was pretty forgettable for me, and he passed well under the 'Phwoar' radar. As David, toned, honed, windswept and very very interesting, he transforms himself from choochy faced upper class boy next door to a lean, devastatingly gimlet eyed sex on legs. Steven's character, David, arrives at the family home of his deceased friend/comrade, Caleb. The family take him in and he soon becomes a protective yet diabolical guardian angel.David does revenge type things that you want him too and you almost think he's a good guy - then the daughter of the household discovers he's a fake and the whole thing falls apart.Why on earth the military police would shoot Willy nilly into a house that might contain innocent bystanders or children makes no sense, and it devolves into a gunfight at the OK Corral type thing. Then we discover the enigmatic David is actually the victim of some kind of experiment, as was Caleb, but it's never properly explained and you're left wondering whether one of the script writers walked out or someone lost a page or two and made it up as they went along.The final denouement was like something out of Halloween 1, 2, 3 4, and 5, and is only just saved by the soundtrack and Dan Steven's cad- like gorgeousness. It would have been so much more interesting and poignant if David's background had been more explained, what exactly had been done to him to twist his psyche in such a way. It's hinted that he was actually psychopathic in the first place...or was he?Overall I enjoyed it, but wish the ending had been a bit more thought out and sophisticated.",The Guest

The dialogue is amateurish. The action is okay. But the story itself is totally unbelievable. David leaves an obvious trail to follow, right from start. He is not subtle in any of the actions he takes so as not to blow his cover. Anna figures the whole thing out and tries to play detective, but does not call the police? You have a guy supposedly using a dead military man's identity, someone you are 100% positive has killed your friend and you are just going to enlist your friend and brother to help with your sleuthing...then also tell him you know? Then there is the incompetent secret military dept that comes after him with big guns and just storm trooper it up. He easily takes out all these men, kills a bunch more people without blinking then gets taken out by two teenagers. But wait...he pulls a Michael Myers at the very end!

Throw in some action set pieces and I think you would not be far away from what this is.It starts out well. A mysterious man turns up at the house of his slain comrade and offers touching words to his family, winning them into his confidence one by one, though, in truth, their grief makes them easy prey. It continues to build well when he sorts out the son's high school tormentors in a way that will have you cheering. At this stage, his cover story that he cares about the family is still plausible, but he is clearly someone with the capacity for extreme violence. The acting is uniformly excellent.However, in a bid to procure a large amount of firearms, he murders the arms dealer he is buying them from. The body count then starts to build implausibly quickly when the man who is standing in the way of the father of the family's promotion is also found conveniently dead.The actors are excellent, as I say, but even they seem progressively unconvinced by the story when some covert government unit turns up to claim The Guest. Apparently he was part of some kind of experiment which went wrong, but details on this are very sparse.The finale is camped up in the extreme and in the style more of an 80s B Movie. Which would make sense if the first half was anything close to that type of film, but instead you are just left scratching your head.There are good moments, the acting is great, but don't be suckered in by the high ratings.

It isn't possible to do everything this bad without it being deliberate! The acting, directing, musical score, it was atrocious. I just had to keep watching. I have never seen anything so, so bad. If it was actually done deliberately, Psychiatric intervention should be done STAT to all involved and if it was deliberate, it should win the Oscar! Idi Amin would have been proud to call this, his Magnum opus. If done deliberately, every one involved should be Oscar bound. It takes extraordinary, consummate skill to have created this. Which is why I gave it a 10. I truly understand good, because I can now say I have seen what Dante's inferno is all about and what was the inspiration for The Scream's artist, Edvard Munch.This is proof of time travel because Munch had to have seen this movie!",The Guest
184,cmahoney9-120-805838,Follow The Symbols,2,27 September 2014,"The Guest is a hard movie to describe, let alone understand. Is it a mystery, a horror movie maybe? Given the premise (soldier comes back to the family of a fallen comrade) it starts off quite intriguing. But then the same soundtrack to Halloween kicks in and the viewer is left to wonder about the type of movie they are watching. Very confusing.You won't be given any real plot details until the end and even at that point you won't understand why the psycho David is where he is and why he is doing what he does. There are so many holes in this movie that it is just ridiculous. And when the 'highly skilled' counter team goes after David, they don't even bother to survey the place first. They just rush in, shoot a million bullets that go everywhere and ... well, you know - only they end up dead.Now, the symbols. The main girl does not remove her triangle Illuminati necklace the entire movie - it is a focal point in her closeups many times over. There are triangles everywhere in the background and at the end she appears with one eye covered over by her hair to take out David. For whatever reason, this movie comes off as a very low budget 80's cinema camp, but at the same time it is filled with the symbols used by H-wood and other elitist/occultists. Why would something so low budget and campy be filled with these symbols of wealth and power? Is it an ode to the Illuminati perhaps and not really a movie for viewers? Myself and the three other people in the audience would like to know the answer.Halloween music, zero actors you know, enough holes to sink an Illuminati's mega yacht, overly graphic cheap kills with no intimacy for the payoff and much much more. Oh yeah, and Obama is the leader in charge of the counter team, but he himself can't hit the side of a barn with his machine gun. 3 Stars. Wish I could draw a triangle here and the eye symbol.",The Guest

187,joeventuraa,OK...Now I Respect Lorenzo Lamas!,1,2 January 2015,"This movie sucks. There, not that I am done with that, if you're a screenwriter or aspiring anything in Starbucks or Denny's right now trying to ""make it"" you have a great chance if you know someone. If this movie got budgeted, then you have to know someone and there is hope for all. So, this movie gives hope. Really.To compare this with Drive...ummm, a very poor man's drive. The script was as good as any average high school kid could muster with minimal effort. The acting was decent and makes you appreciate real actors. No offense, but I'd imagine ""real actors"" without great talent around them resembles life with and without make-up. So life's fare.Mr Wonderful comes into town, is invited to a party with the family daughter, beats up the son's high school bullies in a bar, goes to high school with mom to pick up the son who gets into a fight, plays the role of dad, becomes the masculine energy in the family, and soothes everyone with his swarthy voice.The mother's acting was horrible. Dude from The Wire and LOST...needed a paycheck, and that's cool...but this movie is horrible. Worse than an episode of Renegade. Lorenzo could make this work in 1992, and even then, it was a B TV show at best. If this was a comedy parody, it might work, so aspiring industry folks, keep drinking coffee, you can make it, but do better because every project is your resume and being attached to this movie is career suicide. If it was 1985 we could turn the other cheek, but in 2014, with movies playing 24/7 on cable, cable TV at it's best, and a back log of 90 years of stories on film, this movie proves the best cinematic life lesson: Those who cannot learn from history are doomed to repeat it...and badly!",The Guest
188,peter-j-downey,A film to be watched with friends,5,2 March 2015,"The Guest: David Collins (Dan Stevens), a glib soldier, turns up at the Peterson's home and ingratiates himself as a friend of their dead son. The Peterson's take in Collins as he is down on his luck; despite them being on the brink of collapse after their son's death. However not everything is as it seems, Collins starts producing wads of cash, violence seems to follow him no matter where he goes, and a spate of unusual deaths happen within the community.The is a film from Adam Wingard where the cracks are evident through out; it's fun, it's humour is black and it has visual a style that follows in the steps of Drive, for the most part, but Wingard sacrificed cohesion to achieve this.Let's take the shootout scene in the film as an example; beforehand Collins' background is just shoehorned in to allow for the shootout. As the action in the scene flows several cheesy moves from Collins' turns the tides for him, and while we are lead to believe that the people attacking are an elite squad, the script dumps more exposition into the scene to reveal Collins is the elite-elite. And then to allow for the entire film to come to a neat ending Collins does something that completely undermines his actions in the first half of the film, and Collins repeats this when he bumps into Mr Peterson in the scene after.The script undermines the film time and time again in this regard too; the climactic scene at the school, the epilogue to establish a sequel, Luke Peterson's reaction to some of Collins' more violent tendencies, and creating relationships just to move the film forward, here's looking at you Kristen. Wingard also embraces cliché after cliché; Collins sinisterly stares out windows or into the mirror, the local women are loose and the youth are all drug addicts, the mother is oppressed like Marge Simpson, and the father drinks like someone out of Mad Men.Acting is careless as well; Dan Stevens is just smug throughout, Maika Monroe will be added to pile of strong female protagonists that exclusively turn up in horror films, and the rest of the cast seemed like they had no idea what they had to do in each scene.Nonetheless there is a b-movie/ironic charm to the film; a ""so bad its good"" intention to it all; my housemates and I laughed through most of it, and Wingard plays up to this tone. Hiring Lance Reddick, or as we kept on referring to him ""Cedric Daniels, feels tongue in cheek, so does the continuous pastiche to 80s pop videos and the over the top violence. I would call this a social film, where the enjoyment comes from watching it with friends and laughing at some of the more irreverent scenes.",The Guest

191,GrowMagicBeans,"Too much a homage to be taken too seriously, too engrossing to be but parody",8,7 September 2014,"A stranger, David (Dan Stevens), introduces himself to a bereaved family as a friend of their lost son in combat. David claims that their son's dying wish was that he come and pay them a visit and to do what he can to take care of them... Perhaps David over interprets that dying wish and takes it a little too far or perhaps he's just plain psychopathic, but whatever his motives, we soon find David worming his way into the family fabric, winning over sceptic members and making ambitions come true ...one way or another. A man that seems to never sleep, he has a sinister and peering stare that lets the audience know not all is right by him and that there are secrets lurking behind those cold, killer eyes.Dan Stevens is cast perfectly in this role of David. Dry enough to pass as the perfect, courteous soldier boy to woo a mother in mourning, yet at the same time edgy enough that you don't quite know if he's going to talk his way out, or fist his way out; he has that sadistic glint in his eye that really does make it seem like David enjoys messing with the minds of those weaker advisories. Very much a homage to 80's suspense/horror/slasher style movies, it's slick, yet self-aware enough not to take its narrative too seriously all the time, without becoming too much a farce at any one time. Surprisingly suspenseful, its mood is enforced with a supered electronic score that reflects the brooding tension and mounting suspense. The imperfect beauty of Anna (Maika Monroe) as the very homely, slightly slutty, somewhat angst teen again epitomises the 80's vibe going on. Maika plays the part of Anna beautifully as she tries to reconcile her mixed feelings for the enigma that is David. The shower scene when David opens the door half naked to her wouldn't have worked if they had dressed Maika up as a pristine beauty. Instead she is very much the 'girl next door', conflicted by desire. David is the boy she loves to hate, hates to love and knows not why – is it gut intuition or primitive urge?It reminds me a little of Cold in July (also 2014) in so far as, it builds upon our expectation of the narrative, and, if it doesn't quite break entirely from the mould in this case, it at least pulls on the strings and plays with those expectations. We sort of know the story and will anticipate certain things, but that's good! For example, when the son Luke (Brendan Meyer) is given the choice to either stay in the car, or join David in the bar (where Luke's bully classmates reside within), we already know in our minds that it's going to be a classic showdown. The following scene has to be the highlight of the movie for me! I don't want to ruin the scene for you, but suffice as to say, we all know Luke's curiosity is going to get the better of him, as it has ours.Again, in that playful way, it mixes genres, moving from pure suspense, through action and on into slasher. Even the whole haunted house scene, is such a contrived set-up we have to chuckle a little at its self-referential play on the 80's movie theme – it's the perfect slasher showdown, but who in their right mind would build such an elaborate maze??? But most off, it's such a joy to watch because its assuredly dumb enough to reinvigorate that sometimes cheesy atmosphere we enjoyed as teens in the 80's, yet remains suspenseful and clever enough to reinvent itself within a new era.Too much a homage to be taken too seriously yet too engrossing to be simply a parody, its one of those quirky movies that is brilliant, because of its indifference to the discourse of time, while simultaneously pocking a rod at movie rhetoric .",The Guest

193,bseaman-20248,"Taut, well-acted thriller",8,19 August 2017,"When I finished watching ""The Guest"" on Canadian Netflix last night, I thought, finally, I've seen a movie on Netflix that wasn't mediocre.The Guest is a taut, finely acted thriller that, even if derivative, delivers tension, drama and mystery in spades. Dan Stevens as the mysterious David chews up the scenery and delivers as a muscular stranger who oozes the potential for trigger-happy violence throughout the movie. He's like a lean, younger version of Stanley Kowalski. Respect goes also to Maika Monroe for her commanding performance as a young woman in her late teens who exudes sexuality and insouciance typical of so many teenage girls. Yet her character rises to the occasion when presented with no other option. Brendan Myer as her younger,awkward, bullied brother shines in his role as well.The dramatic pacing of the movie was quite well done too, from the eerie opening scene to the final 30 seconds, which left this viewer wondering whether we might see a sequel.",The Guest
194,rvnc,A highly entertaining action/black comedy.,8,16 September 2014,"The Guest is a movie destined to perform beyond it's relatively meagre budget and release. Word of mouth and positive reviews, particularly among 18-30's (me essentially) will ensure a strong cult following for years to come. Quite right too, as The Guest provides tremendous entertainment throughout, combining superb deadpan humour with high intensity action sequences. Like the excellent British comedy Dead Man's Shoes, the film gradually ramps up both the carnage and the moral ambiguity of the lead character until the audience may be conflicted as to who is the villain and who is the hero. Admitedly the plot is a little light and the film tails off a little towards the end, but it matters little. The 90 minutes fly by and in the end you'll be more than pleased with your discovery of this gem.",The Guest
195,CassC0821,Strange ...,5,6 January 2021,"Yea... im not sure what to say.. the movie started out good - mysterious quality, Dan Stevens is gorgeous and plays the part well, calm and collected, but you know he's probably actually a bit of a psycho and is hiding something major.. but it seems like he cared about Caleb and really is trying to look out for his family even tho he's obviously on the run for something .. about halfway through you start to question the sense of it all, and then it literally turns into a nonsensical 80's slasher film where there's not even any point in any of it and the acting and entire plot turns into a campy mess... very odd. The ending is totally unrealistic too. Soundtrack is weird.. yea i don't know lol. Very disappointed after about halfway on. I'd say starting halfway through or maybe almost 3/4 of the way through, this could've been such a much better film, if they at least could have kept him continuing to protect the family and not try to kill them all, like maybe truly formed a bond with them even despite the fact that Anna was trying to turn him in. I mean I understand that he was part of an experiment that altered his brain but, he protected them the whole time and then just kills them lol. Would've been better if he was able to breakthrough and truly at least just care about them, and then had the family protect him once the military came for him and like hid him and helped him escape. Could've had more substance but it just went in a different direction. Disappointing to say the least. Not what I was expecting. Expected more of a psychological thriller but got a campy slasher film.",The Guest

197,andynaik,A very interesting movie,7,15 September 2014,"I have to admit, I wasn't prepared for this movie. I thought it would be a suspense thriller given the synopsis but boy, this movie was a different ride altogether! Dan Stevens plays David, a soldier looking for a place to stay overnight. He comes to the Petersons to deliver a message from their son, who has fallen. Sheila, the fallen soldier's mother is reluctant at first but allows him inside their home. After seeing a photo of him and her son on the field, she is convinced and invites David to stay at their place. A day turns into a few days. The family members slowly get to know and trust David through the various interactions with him.David's stay soon becomes interesting with a lot of mysterious deaths. Somehow the family members are skeptical about David's involvement in those.The suspense building up to the reveal was intense. I was thoroughly engaged in the movie and confused at the same time about David's character. Who is he? Why is he doing some things? What's his motive? were all questions running through my mind.The movie gets slow paced for a while but there are some really interesting developments and events that make the wait worthwhile. The soundtrack is amazing and plays well with the flow of the movie. Dan Stevens acting was terrific, his portrayal of David was truly terrifying.I see this as kind of a modern take on the thriller genre. I can't give it a 7.5 so it's a 7 for me. Don't go by the trailer and mistake this for what it is. Give it a try. Surely, a movie that ends with the line ""WTF?"" wouldn't be boring.",The Guest
198,mattwilde123,The Guest,7,6 March 2017,"'The Guest' is a surprisingly fun throwback to 1980s horror. It boasts a thumping soundtrack and quick cuts that really fit into the theme of the film. The exaggerated scenes of violence and gore may be a bit too strange for those who do not appreciate the sentimentality and nostalgia of the movie.The narrative is very straightforward and follows Dan Stevens, an ex-soldier, as he returns to his friend's family's house as a dying wish. He protects and helps them through their individual problems but all is not what it seems. The film does lose it's way slightly towards the end as it tries to drastically remind audiences that the film is meant to be over-the-top when it was already doing a subtly good job.Dan Stevens is very good in the main role. From the trailer, it looked like it would be a rip-off of Nicolas Winding Refn's 'Drive' but Stevens adds a very unique coldness to his powerful persona.",The Guest

The good thing is that it keeps you on the edge for most of the time and this works in its favor. The performance of most of the characters is pretty convincing and the music is one of the high points of this movie. The Director of this movie needs to be commended for taking a pretty unique plot and he does justice to the story. The lead character of David is a pretty interesting character and his performance is also one of the highlights in this movie. The outdoor scenes in this movie are also shot in a really nice manner and enhance the overall appeal of the movie. This is a thriller you will not regret watching and will leave you asking for more.,The Guest

With no ""A"" list stars there's really not much that draws you to spend the bucks to see it. Trust me, it will be the best entertainment investment you make this year. ""Dan Stevens"" gives an Oscar worthy performance and entrances you with his command of the character. No doubt there's bigger things in his future. ""Sheila Kelley"" also does a fantastic job of drawing us into her sadness and pain.I wouldn't advise taking any children under 18 as the violence and situations are extremely graphic.",The Guest
204,michel_broeders,Great 80s action-horror thriller (that didn't came out in the 80s),8,29 May 2015,"The Guest is a film brought to you by Adem Wingard and Simon Barrett, the director and writer of You're Next and some of the segments of the anthology series V/H/S. Because I haven't seen one of these movies i had no clue what to expect. In this movie a ""guest"" shows up on the doorstep of a family who lost their son during a war. Because our guest fought with him on the battlefield he is invited to stay with the family for a while. And you might guess it, a lot of weird stuff starts to happen. It's a simple premise and one of my worst plot synopsis' i've written so far but i feel that it wouldn't be right to spoil too much of the story. I can honestly say that The Guest was one of the biggest surprises of 2014. I saw this movie without even having a clue and it was widely entertaining for a bunch of reasons. The aspect that differentiates The Guest from similar attempts is its soundtrack and how the filmmakers gave the soundtrack an importance equal to the main characters. It has that gritty 80s feel all over it that sets the tone for this movie from beginning to end. Dan Stevens as ""the guest"" is fantastic and this role really shows off his range as an actor. He infiltrates this family in every single way and the filmmakers did a really good job of keeping tension and having you wonder for a long time who this guy really is. Much of this is thanks to the performance of Stevens. In a way he's a very likable lead, even when things start to get weird you keep rooting for him. He plays ""the guest"" with so much conviction it's hard to tell what is going on in his mind but one thing is certain, you don't want him in your house for too long. In conclusion The Guest is a great action-horror hybrid from the 80s that's influenced by it in the best possible way. You can tell that these guys have respect for 80s action-horror but also know how to transcend it in to a good movie with a lot of style and tension build in to it.",The Guest

At least the original Frankenstein monster was somehow sympathetic. This is just was he is a poor construct of a script writer.

207,mokhatib,it's nice to have something original and different from time to time,6,25 February 2016,"A good cast, good performances throughout especially by not much known actors and actresses, I liked the reversal of the usual story formula from having a hero or heroes facing a conflict and the bad guy or guys and the hero or heroes win at the end, here we have a story that manipulates the viewer into rooting for the seemingly good guy David Collins (Stevens) who turns out to be the bad guy with only Anna (Maika Munroe) and her brother Luke (Brendan Meyer) as brief protagonists towards the end of the movie when they try to escape Collins and eventually attempt at killing him. This whole turn on the convention is quite nice, this new psychological way of giving the audience a choice who to root for even if it is for the bad guy, maybe some might think David Collins was perhaps the victim of a government experiment and the family he took care of and the people responsible for his situation paid the price, maybe other people saw Collins as a psycho who should be punished. A subplot is noticed of the negative atmosphere an absent father or father figure might leave behind in a family and that's where Dave's involvement and help touches on the violent, illegal, and straight out creepy. All in all it was a rather dull movie until David kills the arms dealer and his friend where the story picks up a bit with the ambiance of a cool 80's kind of soundtrack, awesome direction, and a handsome strong actor, ending up saving the movie just a bit.",The Guest

But the acting is probably the best bit of this movie and this is not saying much.The plot is unsurprising from the first moment, there is nothing left for the audience to guess, imagine or speculate. There is no turn or twist at any given point, so by the time you see the end you are left with an empty feeling, waiting for at least one final turn. The only surprise is to see they provide a hint for a second part ...The start, the end and everything in between is a stereotype of a classical and unoriginal action/thriller movie. Helps kill time if you find nothing better to do, but I'd recommend you keep searching.",The Guest

It is definitely entertaining because of the great performance from Dan Stevens and Maika Monroe. The movie sets up mysterious atmosphere really well which contributes to a great beginning but it does lose its thriller touch after the halfway mark. I gave it 7/10 because it wasn't very ambitious in trying to maintain the tension throughout the movie but on the bright side it still manages to be good enough to keep you entertained till the end.

Really, really don't waste your time.. There's nothing ""cool"" "" kooky"" ""retro"" or ""80's"" about this . It's just plain bad! Dan Stevens was ill advised as were the whole of the cast! Ewwww.

213,tcbently,Retro suspense horror thriller,6,5 September 2014,"The opening five seconds of The Guest tells you all you need to know: it's retro, in the style of Halloween or Carrie. And yet the setting is, presumably, modern: characters use cell phones and burn music CDs on their computers. The problem for the film is Dan Stevens. With his chiselled face, sun tan and blue-eyed charm, it's like the Diet Coke man has been parachuted into a thriller. That's also the problem with two of the other stars, Brendan Myer and Maika Monroe (playing teenage brother and sister). They look too good when the film reverts, eventually, to the cheap schlock horror that it promised at the beginning. Despite some sweet moments of revenge wish fulfilment at a bar frequented by the HS football team and the bizarre denouement, the dominant feeling I had was puzzlement. Things would have been improved, and there would be more unity of tone, had 'the guest's' back story been introduced earlier and in greater detail, perhaps in flashback. As it is, I was left wondering what was the point. It clearly wants to be a homage to John Carpenter B-movies and Stephen King adaptations, yet the intelligent casting and performances betray, at times, something with loftier ambitions and real grit.",The Guest

Unfortunately by the time I watched it, it scored 6,8 IMDb and 78/100 in meta-score which made me think that this movie was worth watching. I was wrong. Dreadful scenario & low-class bad acting are the main features of this movie. Meaningless acts try to build up a scenario based on a psycho narcissistic main character with bad haircut with failed hair dye (Yes the main actor has ORANGE HAIR !!!! ***SPOILER***) surrounded by also low class actors who fail to do what they where hired to (ACT!!). A typical story about a man who is not what he seems to be. Of course I should not forgot to mention the ugly look-a-like of Gwen Stefanie which is the second leading character of this meaningless movie bad acting movie. For example after some horrible happening to her, she cries like she was cleaning onions. This movie sucks so bad that I wanted to WRITE A REVIEW FOR OTHER USERS TO AVOID WATCHING OR WASTING THEIR TIME!",The Guest
220,bradaviel,Like an 80s psycho brawler. A great one.,8,26 January 2015,"I kept hearing that The Guest was a good movie despite its cheesy setting, and i have to admit it is, to the point it made the list of my favorite movies in recent years. I'm a sucker for efficient brawlers with great characters and nostalgic feel, especially is the nostalgic feel traits for the 80s. Somewhere in the lines between Rutger Hauer's Hitcher and Christian Slater Heaters, Dan Stevens is a force to be reckoned with, especially when he reveals what lies behind his cheerfully communicative smile. Along with purple dark light and blunt characters, the OST keeps that 80s feel and pace with classic tunes from Clan of Xymox and haunting tracks that do not pale in comparison with Brad Fiedel's Terminator soundtrack. Highly recommended if you're into that sort of thing as I am.",The Guest

As he is charming and self-effacing guy who manipulates all the people he gets what he wants and he quietly starts to make the rules. He knows how to get a good publicity and what people want so he helps the family members to get their trust which he gets of all of them but Anna finds everything weird. She had realized he just came at the family, he has no any money inflow or a job but he manages to get things he wants. Since the beginning it was very suspicious to Anna but until she heard him suspiciously talking with an unknown person on the phone, she calls the army center to check his data. Army center immediately calls the top hierarchy people who went for David. From that scene everything changes and the movie begins.",The Guest

Honestly this movie is worth a ten just for his character but the rest of the cast put in great performances and it's an entertaining movie throughout.Love the main man David though.I'm not going to spoil any of the movie as its worth watching and enjoying it yourself. Although it does get a bit predictable for the last 20 minutes or so, that doesn't make it any less enjoyable. David is such a bad ass too. All in all, it's an incredibly entertaining movie full of action and a memorable character.",The Guest

But at the last 30 mins it proved me wrong. Another example where it almost failed - even after going in quiet promisingly.Being said that, this is worth watching; but don't keep much expectations. Also there are mutiple notable flaws can be found in the movie. Like why the military special force will come with only 6 shooters OR why Caleb's sister doesn't call 911/discuss the matter seriously when she found something mysterious on David! Ignore them...The story develops when an unwanted guest joins Peterson family and things keeps on happening. Acting wise everyone does it quiet well. & JUST Loved Dan stevens as David, his acting probably suppresses most of all the other messes created by the script. Soundtracks are nice too.Recommend: Yes.",The Guest

The music and some of the hairstyle and things were SO set in the 80s. If this movie wasn't a spoof, then the music for the movie was INCREDIBLY dated and the ending made you think you were watching something like ""Carrie"" or ""Fright Night"" from the 80s.

There can not be any spoiler in such a cliché, expected, effortless production!I can not believe-like so many others-that this movie has this score! I believe it is getting harder and harder to make a decent thriller/horror movie, and people are forgetting about how good it was to watch a good thriller. So they vote sixes or sevens for this piece of crap. I think I could have acted better. No, anybody could have acted the same way as the leading actor. Apparently, to play a psychopath, it is enough to just stare blankly. Nothing more! And what bullshit story about military experiments? This is so absurd I had the impression they wrote it in a drive in burger place while waiting for their order. So bad, so predictable. Forget about this.

228,estatelawcanada,Good action movie,8,28 March 2015,"Dan Stevens is terrific in this movie. He is very convincing in the role of a soldier who turns up claiming to be a friend of the Peterson family's son who was killed in action. He's sexy, charming, polite, and he stands up for the family's teenage son who is being bullied. No wonder everyone loves him, at least at first.There is nothing really surprising about the plot. There are no real twists that we can't predict a mile away, but mostly that didn't interfere with the enjoyment of the movie. I felt that the story of why ""David"" is such a threat and why the military is so determined to kill him needed more explanation. There were a few sentences about how he was involved in a military experiment (no, really?) but not enough to do justice to the movie's considerable body count.The final scenes in the high school reminded me somewhat of the school gym scene in ""Carrie"". They had the same feel and a similar look.Though the plot is not new or surprising, the story is well told and the acting was good throughout. The action was non-stop. This movie won't keep you up at night pondering any deep, philosophical questions; it's light entertainment, straightforward and unpretentious. I enjoyed it.",The Guest
229,Callam_10,I need to write this review,10,14 August 2017,"let me start by saying this a ""throw-away"" movie, by that i mean i expected it to be garbage, but it only cost £1 so i'm not bothered if its a massive flop.I found myself bored yesterday, so decided to chuck this movie in the ps3, like i mentioned before i wasn't expecting much, however within the first 10 minutes i was hooked. I have no idea who Dan Stevens is but his performance was incredible, he makes a psychotic killer seem like a cool friendly guy. As we see his progression from a random nice guy, to a FBI slaying madman you can't help but root for the guy. The other characters in the film are mostly well played Brendan Meyer ""Luke"" being another favourite of mine. This is one of those unassuming movies and my god I'm glad it watched it, definitely up there on my list now. Just reading through IMDb before posting this and apparently it did terrible in sales, which is a massive shame as its an incredibly well done film with some great talent, i cannot recommend it enough",The Guest
230,domdel39,Not exactly a Guest-ing Game,4,26 March 2015,"I don't think this film is about anything. By that, I don't mean that ""The Guest"" lacks a plot or story or characters, but, that, I don't think its' trying to send a message or make a statement or even re-create a genuine human experience. I think we've all seen films that try too hard to do the opposite - that is, use a sledgehammer to send a VERY IMPORTANT MESSAGE to the audience. Those films can be irritating, and, I, generally, try to avoid them. But what do you make of a film that isn't about anything? Despite this obvious flaw, ""The Guest"" is still well made, has good production values. Well shot and edited, ""The Guest"" also features a solid cast. Also, on the plus side, it has a self-awareness that makes it all go down a little easier. But, apart from tipping its' hat to Hitchcock's ""Shadow of a Doubt"", copping a bit from Polanski's ""Rosemary's Baby"" and revelling in a very bloody climax, ""The Guest"" is an exercise in waiting for very predictable story beats to play themselves out.So, should you welcome ""The Guest"" into your home? Sure, but, it may just wear out that welcome before it wants to.",The Guest
231,AvalonToo,Dan Stevens is best part of the movie which was no good,4,18 November 2014,"When I was younger, I would see anything in the theater because I like movies and tickets was a lot cheaper back then. I would not waste a penny for this one.When Dan Stevens left Downton Abbey, I'd heard comments about him making a David Caruso mistake. That may be but he seems to pick up some interesting roles. I barely recognize him in this film or in A Walk Among the Tombstone, which was a much better movie. He is undoubtedly the best part of the film. He was intense and creepy even if the character is rather 2 dimensional. All the rest of the characters pale in comparison. However, even a B-movie needs decent supporting characters especially when the plot is crap. The other characters including Major Carver (played by Lance Reddick) are flat and uninteresting. Frankly, I don't know what the heck Lance Reddick is doing in this movie. One would think he has better things to do.The film could have been a decent thriller but it degenerated into a mess of Halloween slasher film with an attractive villain instead of a rotting face behind a hockey mask. The motivation of the characters are either unexplained or abbreviated so much that it was unconvincing. It became obvious really quickly that the film makers had just a vague concept but no idea how to realize it.I like the soundtrack but what 20 year old would listen to the kind of music that the character Anna Peterson listen to. It's before her time. Come on. It's hard to imagine that a girl like Anna would be into an obscure, aged Dutch goth band. Someone must be a big fan of the Clan of Xymox. Anyway, I digress. I really want to like this movie after I saw the preview but it turned out to be such a disappointment. It's not even a B-movie. It's at best a C minus minus minus if not a D.",The Guest
232,mehmetski,"bad plot, with good acting and 1-2 decent scenes",4,25 May 2015,"my sister and i watched this movie, in expectation of a serious home invasion movie. strange military guy visits family of his deceased companion. alright, might be interesting. he gets overprotective of the family which is kinda cute somehow. there's the scene with the emo boy who slapped another kid in the face and they're talking to the head of school and the military guy threatens with law enforcement because of hate crime against a gay student. this scene was by far the best one. but thats my point: it was supposed to be a thriller or even horror movie, but actually the funny scenes were the highlights. thats not really what we were hoping for. okay, maybe our fault. the actors are great and the setting is nicely done and even some minor details are great (hand grenades causing a dusty explosion, not lots of flames) but the plot....oh got the first half was just boring, then was that part when the girl found out but everyone else was so dense and naive....and then suddenly the military rolls on and obviously they only have like 20 shots each and the bad guy is a mad sniper with a regular hand gun while the others have machine guns and barely manage to hit his leg. ugh that scene really killed the thrill because it was so bad.not the worst movie ever, but only because the set, actors and music were really good.",The Guest
233,gus495,"""What the ****"" indeed",8,28 January 2015,"Going into this movie, you might be under the seriously mistaken impressions that you are watching a thriller. Indeed, throughout most of its running time it bears all the resemblances of a psychological suspense movie. Like its protagonist however, crazy is always brewing under the surface, and once it gets released you don't know quite what you are watching.The Guest centers around David, an ex-soldier who seeks shelter with the family of one of his fallen comrades. Though the family is initially happy to have a friend of their lost son in their house, soon something begins to feel distinctively off about him. David is played by Dan Stevens with perfect conviction, always cool and charming on the outside, but with his inner lunatic always being subversively present. There are several moments in the movie where you know things are about to get out of whack, and seeing David trying to contain his inner demon is gleefully fun.Most surprising about the Guest is how it manages to make a complete 180 degrees shift into slasher territory and actually get away with it. About two thirds throughout all pretenses of being a thriller are dropped and the movie goes in full on frenzy mode. Here we get insane theories about genetic engineering and sequences that don't quite make a lot of sense, and best of all it is a blast to watch. Special mention goes to the editing and the music, which might not be too far off in a Quintin Tarentino movie. Overall, the Guest is one and a half hour of unembellished fun, and will likely appease to anyone looking for a no-frill ride to enjoy.",The Guest

David is intent in making this family's life better...in the most violent ways. Where it all goes wrong is when it's introduced that David is some escaped super soldier. Then the movie throws logic out the window and it turns into an 80's B-horror flick. There's lots of things that don't work from story details to character inconsistencies to unnecessary body count. It's worth watching for Dan Stevens' performance and the music score, but it's a hot mess from top to bottom.",The Guest

237,krazy-mm,Good thriller!,7,2 December 2018,"For some time, it is hard for me to find a good thriller. Then, I've stumbled across this one here. The story is simple but believable - at least for me, since there was war in my country a few decades ago.
First of all - Dan Stevens is incredible in his role! He carries the entire movie - you can't help yourself but to like him, but you know you shouldn't. Really, but REALLY cool good/bad guy. From the beginning, you can see something isn't right, but waiting for the climax as he story progresses is really fun to watch. I like Maika Monroe from ""It Follows"", and in ""The Guest"" she is far more attractive to me, probably 'cause her appearance of a smart ""bad girl"". Another guy I really liked here is Lance Reddick from ""Fringe"" and ""John Wick"" and boy, these secret service guy roles suits him well! The rest of the cast was really good, but again - Dan Stevens is unbeatable in his ""David"" role!If you like good thrillers, go make yourself a popcorn and enjoy this one, hope this one won't disappoint.",The Guest

240,Nebbuless,Convincing,9,3 September 2016,"I blindly watched this movie not knowing what it was. I quickly realized it was some kind of beautiful Cape Fear, What About Bob?, Terminator 1984 mashup.This movie was recommended to me by Comicbookgirl19 in part of her series about underrated/unknown movies. I'm so glad I took her advice in watching this film.Maybe I'm naive, but the suspense builds so beautifully in this film. In the beginning, the main antagonist establishes he's not the antagonist by reaffirming the viewer (and the main characters) he's clearly in a framed picture on the mantle of the unsuspecting family's fireplace.Dan Stevens reassures us time and time again he's not the bad guy, even though jaded movie goers know he is. Maybe I'm like a child in a ball pit but I could not track when and how he would ever become evil.Dan shows us how he's a friend to the victim family, and helps them through their hardest of times, literally. I won't spoil much more but at first he's like the friend everybody and nobody needs.To sum it up, watch this film, as it is pure indulgence for some, such as myself.Dan Stevens is a total sleeper/underdog actor. Only after watching this movie I realized he was in Downton Abbey. I also heard he might possibly be in contention for the next James Bond, and in my opinion he would absolutely kill in that role.",The Guest

244,bluesfan2713,"Had potential, but then completely failed in the end.",5,11 August 2015,"I'll be honest the movie started out really good. Most thrillers don't have any tension until 30-45 minutes in but here you felt it almost immediately. The audience could tell right away that there was something wrong with ""David."" The acting on all parts seemed descent for a low budget thriller. However, here are a few issues I had with this film. 1) I think it's a little ridiculous that the mother of the family invited a complete stranger to stay with them within the first five minutes of the movie. It wouldn't matter if he was a friend of mine or not my parents would never do that if they didn't know him. Besides David kept a butt load of cash on him at all times he would be fine in a hotel. 2) I guess all tough guys can break the law as much as they want and get away with it. Several times throughout the film David uses physical violence to intimidate the people around him and yet nobody does anything like call the police. 3) I'm not a cop but this movie completely makes military police look like helpless wimps as do a lot of other films. How can one guy manage to kill a half a dozen special trained federal officers and walk away barely touched? Plus aren't they wearing bullet proof vests? They seem to get shot in the chest and are killed instantly. 4) The music. The soundtrack for this movie was God awful aside from a few moments of tension building. But the actual song selections were horrible. SPOILER ALERT*** 5) Finally the ending. It seems as if the first hour of the script was done by a professional and then the writer handed the pen to a rookie for the last half hour or so. I was honestly hoping that David was dead after being stabbed and shot several times but let's face it killers in movies never die and seem to always be alive at the end. Also, the detective said they found two bodies (military policeman, the kid's teacher in detention.) When David walked out in a fireman's suit that must mean that he had to kill a fireman for it so where did that body go? If I wrote the script, I would have made the twist be that David was actually the dead son Caleb who fell victim to a foreign based neurological experiment gone wrong and was forced to get plastic surgery and had his brain messed with to think he was a different person. And then instead of having him walk away in a fireman suit I would have had the ending be him knocking on the door of the family of another soldier in that group picture from the beginning saying ""Hi, I'm David. I was a close friend of ____""Not a bad watch overall just like I said it started off good and then had a lot of problems. It's a descent movie for a late night with popcorn and Netflix.",The Guest
245,leominosa,A fun and self-aware thriller; retro without being old fashioned,7,29 August 2014,"I've never watched Downton Abbey, but I'm guessing that Dan Stevens deliberately sought out very different roles after leaving the show. The Guest is the perfect advert for his abilities. He's convincing as the mysterious but charming visitor and equally capable in moments of action, suspense or humour. I hope the right roles come along for him as he's entertaining to watch and has got everything required to become a major star.The plot unfolds in a fashion that renders a summary both unnecessary and unwanted if you're planning to see this, but after the initial set-up it progresses at a decent pace and with escalating tension.A special mention is required for the soundtrack. The electronic score is one of the film's major strengths and is perfectly judged.An entertaining and self-aware mix of action, suspense and dark humour, the Guest has a retro feel without being old fashioned (a quality that is encapsulated by the score), and features decent performances.",The Guest
246,Narniatonto,What does war do to a man?,6,19 June 2020,"Adam Wingard's The Guest is an entertaining thriller, but if there ever was a film about the debilitating effects of war, here it is. The action sequences here are no different from any other action movie of recent years, but the underlying themes add an extra layer of meaning.The movie follows a soldier who appears at a family's doorsteps claiming to have fought alongside their deceased son in the army. The soldier, played suave, if not charming (and appropriately unhinged later in the film), by Dan Stevens, is welcomed into the family and allowed to sleep in his comrade's childhood bedroom. Soon, the family's daughter begins to suspect his involvement in a series of deaths that hit close to home.The soldier, a man by the name of David Collins, insinuates himself in the family's lives. David makes it his mission to ascertain whether they feel loved by the lost son, and improve their lives to the best of his abilities. The father - after multiple beers - confides in David and confesses to him his insecurities at work. The son, Luke, is inhibited and bullied, and the daughter, Anna, is stuck in a plodding relationship. The dad's superior is found inexplicably dead, the bullies are hospitalized, and the boyfriend is being penned for a murder he did not commit, with evidence heavily suggesting otherwise. Anna has her suspicions.There's a fine line being drawn between a hero and villain. Like a hero, David's actions are intended for the betterment of the family, but like a villain, the means are increasingly macabre. The fight scenes in the first act look on the surface to be badass, but the violence is not to be gawked at. For example, in an early scene set in a bar, David attacks a group of high school students. Many will invariably deem the fight ""cool,"" but what we have here is a grown man bullying kids. The morality of the students is questionable, but the course of action is gratuitous, nonetheless.There's the usual stuff like the convoluted and over-the-top reveal that David underwent a special intelligence experiment (technically a spoiler but I won't divulge the specifics). There's the obligatory scene where the daughter overhears the guest calling a hit. And there are some equally clichéd scenes sprinkled throughout.But protruding past the frankly familiar facade, the film offers a scathing look at not just what war does to soldiers and their families, but the damage the military itself does to people.David is a man made into a weapon by the military. This disregard for the sanctity of life is prominent throughout the film. A teacher is brutally stabbed by David and the camera pans to the corpse - lingering - to suggest that the bloody death is not a product of mental illness or substance abuse, but military intervention.",The Guest
247,tomdugan2-1,High Film Rating Is Suspect,4,17 January 2015,"For those making viewing decisions based on ""The Guest's"" very high score - the film is going to be a big letdown.I won't repeat the many existing negative IMDb reviews but will confirm the film has a weak, confused script, dozens of major plot holes, wooden acting and weak directing. The film is jam packed with violence - so maybe a younger audience is skewing the rating. It is listed as a drama / thriller so I tried to look at this from as many angles as I could to try to understand the high rating (black comedy? ground-breaker?). Although I admit I could be missing something others saw - I am sticking with my original impression of a bad film voted way up by enthusiastic fans.Hoping the ""9"" and ""10"" people are not shills, I would like to point out that voting should be done in the context of other films. In other words, if you really think this film is as good as the best ever made, a ten is an honest vote. If not, maybe a six would be a more appropriate marker for others who are considering paying for the film.",The Guest
248,moviefest-90757,Candy Coloured Psycho Thriller,9,4 March 2021,"Adam Wingard's 'The Guest' is a sleek, intelligent and thrilling candy-coloured art-house psychological thriller that boasts a psychotically charming performance from blue-eyed brit Dan Stevens and an intelligent script packed with original twists and ample thrills.A grieving family inivite a seemingly innocent, well-mannered, charming guest that claims to be a close friend of their recently departed loved one, into their home. As soon as you lock eyes with David you succumb to his undeniable charm, you believe he has good intentions without caring for any explanation, just like the Peterson's.There's a quiet but deadly swagger about him; suave, mysterious, calm, charming, yet an extremely dark aura permeates from his presence. You know something is amiss, but you're so entranced by David's persona you fail to acknowledge or accept there is something incredibly dark and mysterious about him, that is until it's too late.Dan Steven's is extraordinarily talented and criminally under-appreciated. He can switch from quiet, polite and charming to darn right psychotic and intimidating in a split-second without ever feeling anything but authentic. He demands your presence, drawing you into every scene with his telling eyes and mysterious demeanour.Director Adam Wingard's 'The Guest' is a homage to genre cinema. He calls back to classic thrillers of past in order to reinvent the genre with something fresh, thrilling and wickedly fun. Every collective aspect, from the intense synth score Cliff Martinez would be proud of, to the taut tonal shifts, the cutting dark humour, the Tarantino-esque violence and the intelligent screenplay combines in harmonious fashion, creating a film with a perfect fluency.Check out my IG @MovieFestUK",The Guest
249,ziyaaliyev,Do not watch it!!!,1,18 August 2016,"First I thought it is the acting that is lacking then I skip to the soundtrack from acting, but still awful. Then I came to the conclusion that it is the director and the script that is awful. Maybe there are people out there who would argue:""Hey man, this is his (directors) way, it is great in its way"", but I am sorry. I've watched lots of movies and I know when the Movie is directed badly. When I watched this movie I felt like it was a first time try of a newly graduated director wanna be, or a porn director. I am still counting on the porn director. I mean in which country restaurant waitresses dress like Japanese schoolgirls. Guys if you do not wanna waste your two hours skip this movie. Art is lacking in this movie. But I have to say visual effects was not so bad. All in all it was one of the most awful movies I've ever watched and the most awful movie which had every available physical condition except the directing and the art. Do not watch it!!!",The Guest
250,RedQuinn,How are people giving this a good review?,3,16 January 2015,"This has to be one of the most predictable movies I've ever seen. So this dude comes into town, and almost immediately, people start dying. No one suspects a thing until the stupid blonde decided to start snooping around, which ruins the movie. A team of professional killers wouldn't just roll up to the house where they think the guy is in the middle of the day. They didn't even do any surveillance...they just drive right up and get slaughtered. How did the guy with the SAW not mow him down when he broke out of the garage? So David takes off with the Suburban not far behind him, and it takes the MP guy forever to catch up to where David wrecked the car. I know it had 2 flat tires, but c'mon! Then David walks into a corn field, and a few minutes later, he's driving a minivan. Where did he get the minivan and how did he know what diner she worked at? And why did he kill the people at the diner? To ""tie up loose ends?"" That was completely unnecessary. Why did no one freak out when he shot the girl? Why did he throw the 2 frag grenades? I've thrown a few frags in my day and they only have a kill radius of about 5 meters, so what about the people in the kitchen? Oh and he rolled those frags pretty far, so there's no way the doors would blow out like that. How the heck did the military police guy know about the explosion? How did he know the mother was dead? He never even went in the house. Is he psychic? Then, the best line in the movie ""how do I get through this maze?"" Ummmmm keep walking you idiot. Why does David leave the gun next to the guys body? Don't you think he'd wanna keep that? You know, to kill people with. Why does the high school only have 2 exits? Like most people, I went to high school, and my high school had a lot of exits. The girl shoots him, and he somehow disappears in ankle high fog. Why doesn't he stab her somewhere that would kill her? She has a gun! How did David not die??? He was shot 3 times and stabbed in the chest! Bottom line: this movie was terrible.",The Guest

I loved the stylish cinematography and design, the dialogues are one of the most intense and accurate writing that i ever seen. The 80s atmosphere with the music and the clothes and design with the tension of an horror movie and the action structure of an thriller make a mix if perfection in writing and meticulous directing the best way to carry all the themes and the plot.

253,GelatinousJoe,"Not impressive, not smart, and most of all not self-aware",3,28 September 2016,"Adam Wingard is a nice guy, and I can appreciate what he's trying to do. His movies have charm. But I do not like his movies, and I do not like The Guest.The first thing people say when criticizing the stupidity and cheese of The Guest is that it's supposed to be like that. That it's an homage. I agree it is an HOMAGE, not a parody or satire. The movie is a subversion of Terminator type movies from the 80s. The subversion part of the movie is that the movie is smarter, more emotional, and more serious than the typical fare of the genre. The issue with that is it is as dumb, as cheesy, and as impressive as any subpar movie in the genre. The Guest's largest issue is it takes itself so god damn seriously. You're supposed to take this seriously, and the movie suffers for it.The acting is mediocre at BEST, and had me wincing at worst. The camera-work and aesthetic are bland, very bland. The action scenes have some production value, but not the know how to make them anything less than boring. The story certainly isn't engaging enough to hold my attention.The Guest is a dumb and cheesy movie that wants to be smart and serious. I would not recommend it, unless you LOVE Adam Wingard'a other work. The flaws are the same as his other projects, and the charm is the same. This movie is bad enough to be a parody of itself if it wasn't trying to be serious.",The Guest

Dan Stevens gives a great performance and from the minute he is on the screen you get more and more curious about his character. Straightforward plot and easy to digest.

257,Bwohahaha,Satisfactory Flick For A Leisure Time,8,1 February 2015,"To begin with, this is one of those movies people have a biased opinion on.The Guest is a slow-burner suspense flick that exposes its premise very little as you anticipate but fairly enough to keep you interested in it and the title character David played oddly by Dan Stevens. The whole first half of the movie is a slow, wary build-up of foreboding and suspense. It gradually begins to disclose the mystery surrounding 'The Guest' as the movie progress only into the second half. As our Guest appears out of nowhere to a family claiming to be good friends of their deceased son, little of him is said. He earns the family trust and affection as he starts helping them in their adversities. Then the movie takes a quick expected turn.What I liked the most about the movie is its slow paced story building with minimalist aesthetics and synth-pop soundtrack to enhance its rather ominous tone. The air of mystery and suspense lingers on from the very beginning David knocks at the Peterson's doorstep and lasts until the twisted ending. The character of David is the suspense factor of the movie. Dan Steven's performance is solid. He draws our curiosity as he shows up being a nice guy who seems to have a sinister alter- ego however hesitates to show any intentions or motives. Even though the movie has no complex plot, it still requires and asks for your attention frequently due to the awkwardness in attitude of the title character. This isn't a highly recommended movie but its direction is a far cry from the rest of the thrillers out there. And the development of story and characters is intriguing. Altogether, The Guest is an arguably satisfactory movie for a late night leisure time.",The Guest
258,sallymartin13,Utter drivel,1,30 November 2014,"Where to start? This movie is one of the worst I've seen in a long time. Predictable story line, poor dialogue and dreadful acting. . All the usual cliché stereotypes are here. Rebellious daughter, bullied loner son, bickering parents, stoner boyfriend,mysterious stranger, do I need to continue? I had been looking forward to this movie for quite some time, I'd seen a trailer and thought it looked good. The story line certainly had great potential, it could have gone anywhere but instead went the route of something you'd expect of a seventies slasher movie with the body count building up as you go.

I am a little surprised to see Dan Stevens taking on a role like this, especially after watching him on ""Downton"". I have to give it to the director, Adam Wingard, for his references to classic thrillers. But the dialog was ridiculous, and the plot was like a video game. Characters were so one-dimensional that they seemed like something out of a comic book. Most of all, I'm bothered by how this film made light of so much violence. The screenplay didn't really explain anything, beyond the intended ambiguity of the director. I cannot recommend a lot of movies these days, this one included. Maybe I'm nostalgic for the classics.

The laughs are subtle and played for, and when the bad guy meets his 'end' as he closes his eyes beside a Halloween tombstone, it's hard not to be impressed by the sheer insanity of it all. The production belies its relatively small budget; always a good sign. Tight direction, a cast on form - all n' all, not too shoddy. Postscript: Dan Stevens, good work with the accent.

It's all fun, and it really doesn't hurt that Dan Stevens (whoa, cousin Matthew from Downton Abbey) shines in this role and carries this mediocre story to something memorable. The OST is also noteworthy, it really provides the icing to the cake. The directing style much reminiscent of Drive with an 80's vibe.

268,maxcobain,A Fantastic Cliché,8,7 September 2014,"Adam Wingard's 'The Guest', is for almost the entirety of the film, absolutely submerged in clichés, from the high-school bullies to the withdrawn but intelligent son and attractive, rebellious older daughter combo. But this is in no means a criticism, as this use of classic film staples only creates even more of a shock when they come crashing down in the final act of the film. The slow-burn, and on the surface-level, seemingly generic first half of the film is used to build a complete picture of American ordinariness, the mid-level, mid-life, over-drinking father, and stay-at-home mother, as well as the afore-mentioned children, are so commonplace in film that they become instantly relatable, and when the thrilling finale gets under way, it becomes all the more astonishing as it unfolds. Wingard's taut, tense shots of the Ryan Gosling-esque Dan Stevens building turmoil are masterful, and the ability to excel at this and both the later action scenes add to an extremely captivating 100 minutes, that could provide his breakthrough into the mainstream.",The Guest
269,cameraslie,Works our imaginations,9,3 September 2014,"A film that lets us use our imaginations, draw our own conclusions, in a crowded market of exposition, narration and over explaining. The viewer is respected by things not being spelt out to them. A bold choice, but leaving a film asking questions about it at least tells us it's given us something to think about. Character driven, The Guest is about a former soldier who arrives to empathise with a grieving family, and solve their problems, preferring violence, all the while approaching situations with a slightly arrogant dark humour. Equal to his military combat ability, is David's charm, used to worm his way into family life and the teenage daughter's social circle. Entertaining throughout, The Guest moves at the ideal pace. The formation and development of relationships is key, with the mother liking David straight away, and him having to win the rest over when he can. Complementing this is his ability and the story's necessity for him to switch from the charming family friend into a cold-hearted soldier with a mission, and we realise, that in all situations, he is a man of solutions. With The Guest seemingly being made on a low budget, we'd hope that a second instalment is offered without budgetary restrictions, as one can only imagine the film that could have been made.The Guest is tense, and dares to be different, enhanced by its 80s feel. Never a dull moment.If You enjoyed this, I'd recommend Stoker, fairly similar and also about a man moving in with a family due to some connection to a deceased relative.CamerasLie",The Guest
270,jakem376,Gripping without even trying,8,14 May 2020,"(WARNING SPOILERS AHEAD)
I really enjoyed this film, Dan Stevens plays a very convincing bad guy, his empty gaze when the camera is Close is very good and he portrays the character perfectly. The film is fairly slow with not much happening in the middle apart from an awesome fight scene. But being a slow film suited it perfectly whereas other films it ruins the movie. The character development is really good as you slowly start to see the ""real"" David Collins come out. David is one of those characters you really shouldn't like but can't help liking him. The movies twist is awesome, finding out that David is actually a medical experiment gone rogue is fantastic and after he kills the mum and dad who took him is such a good moment as it shows the emptiness of his character. The only thing I wasn't a fan of was the ending. I'm all for a good cliff hanger but this one didn't suit the movie. So what happens is the brother who was supposedly his friend ends up stabbing him in the chest when David is trying to kill his sister. David falls to the floor as if he is dead. Then when the brother and sister are sitting in the ambulance you see David walk out dressed as a fireman and that's it. This is how I would have ended it. David managed to kill both the brother and sister showing that there is nothing he won't do to protect him self. He gets away with the murders and walks away from the school and the credits role. Then mid way through you see another family eating dinner and the door knocks the mother opens the door and David is there, he introduces himself in the exact way he did to the previous family and she lets him in and that's the end. That's just my opinion, however this film is great if you like action thrillers. Great movie.",The Guest

Is it the most original story ever? No. Is it the best acting ever? No. But it has got some surprises and a great soundtrack. And the guy in this movie really kicks ass.

Now that he stepped up to make an indie movie, I was kind of interested. And thus, The Guest was born.The Guest is horror-thriller movie, which stars Dan Stevens, Maika Monroe and other not so very known actors. What confuses me about the categorization of this movie, is the ""horror"" label. This movie isn't horror, HOWEVER it is made to LOOK like a horror movie. To be exact, The Guest is a homage to 80's slasher flicks, and it does it without ripping off any movie really.==== SPOILER ALERT / SPOILER ALERT / SPOILER ALERT ==== Plot: A man claiming to be the friend of a son, that the Petersen family lost visits the family in an effort to take care of them. However, soon it is discovered that this new visitor is much more on the surface.The plot sure is something new. Never have I seen really an idea so well incorporated into a feature length movie, that The Guest succeeds at. The movie is essentially built up as a horror movie, particularly a 80's slasher. That's what makes this movie kind of enjoyable, as it tries to pay homage to then known horror movies with scream queens, unstoppable antagonists and synthwave/retro music popularized by John Carpenter.Acting: Dan Stevens comes off as an interesting, but ominous character, that has charisma and intelligence. Every time he was on screen, his influence could be seen on the other characters as well. The interaction between characters is also very very well done. Its fluid and smooth, because in here you actually CARE about the family members and even the guest himself becomes extremely likable. Character development is strong with this movie at least, so if you want to see that sort of interaction, this movie is fit for that. Here's a bit of a spoiler: there's a scene with two characters discussing on keeping a secret from flowing outside by putting it just between them. It tells about professionalism, that these officials have for the sake of the plot and the pacing.Soundtrack: As the movie is basically a 80's slasher flick, the entire OST consists of remixes of electronic songs or completely made up songs that feature synthwave/electro punk/wave genres. This is one aspect, that makes this movie feel like a blast from the past.Cinematography: Not much can be said about it, however there are several shots of Dan Steven's character looking straight into the camera for a handful of seconds. Even though his expressions are neutral, he still looks menacing, especially due to the fact that he is a tad bit too friendly.Overall: The movie is one of those gems, that people will eventually come to. It has great acting, music and action to keep it refreshing and original. It's pacing is one of the best things, as said before, since its developed as a horror movie from start to finish. I recommend The Guest for those wanting something different and organic. It's fun, thrilling and enjoyable. 9/10.",The Guest

283,follin-greg,Most under-appreciated of 2014,10,11 July 2016,"I knew absolutely nothing about The Guest before seeing it in 2014. Noticing it towards the top of a Grantland (RIP) writer's year-end film list, I randomly decided to VOD it without any further research. Being a trailer averse weirdo, I think this is the best way to go into any movie (to a certain extent, obviously most would want to know whether they are seeing The Rock punch bad guys or Carey Mulligan play a British housekeeper with a secret). This especially rings true in The Guest's case. Some of the developments throughout the movie come so far out of left field that I legitimately cackled in delight.So I won't divulge much about the plot of this movie, but I will say the ambiance carries a perfect blend of Drive, Halloween, and The Terminator. It features a great synthpop soundtrack, which is a device I've noticed many filmmakers using to ""retro-up"" their films and it almost always resonates with me. Dan Stevens serves as the star, who I had never heard of before but apparently he's an alum of ""Downton Abbey,"" or as I like to call it ""The Show that Ruined Christmas"" (long story). Usually when I come across a movie that I've never even heard of it's a bad sign, but The Guest was a clear exception, becoming my second favorite movie of 2014.",The Guest

So when i am watching this Flick it's very easy to predict the story and the next coming scenes But Hero Action is awesome one and There's a sci-fi element in the storyline which needed a bit more detail The fact that the high school is making elaborate preparations for Halloween brings in some strident echoes of John Carpenter's 'masterwork'.HE GUEST is a hokum movie with too much of the kind of violence younger audiences now expect and crave, but a sturdy performance from Stevens makes lifts his transition from Downton to Haddonfield out of the B-movie slot where the derivative script would otherwise have left it.",The Guest
292,mads-madsen,A sad day for humanity - I've lost all faith,1,31 January 2015,"The only reason why I can be bothered writing this review, is because the film actually get's pretty good reviews by sources I normally trust and also got a pretty good write up. And yet - it's hopeless - really hopeless - honestly! I've lost all faith - I can hardly breath. This film was absolutely, impossibly, ludicrously bad. It started out (almost) OK, but it rapidly sank into the most predictable, stupid, imbecile, childish ... well ... pooh. OK - in all seriousness: Most of the acting is pathetic and entirely unbelievable - It's so bad, that I wondered if I was watching a comedy - but that's clearly not the intention. The music is like an 80's German porn movie.The storyline is so hopelessly predictable, that it frankly made me cringe. Our antagonist gives the son of the house a folding knife for ""protection"" and he - of course - ends up killing the protagonist with said knife. Yikes! The head (or something like that) of the Military Police goes out on a hunt for David (with a bit of backup which rapidly get's killed off) - what in heavens name is he doing that for if the guy is so dangerous.The Dad get's killed in a head-on collision with David from which David walks away with a bit of a limp. What?!?? And the ending in the Halloween setting - Utterly dilettante. ... I could go on and on ... I need a drink!",The Guest
293,ben-com,Terrible film in terms of plot but very funny otherwise,5,2 January 2015,"Whether intentional or not, Wingard has done very well to create a film that makes no sense whatsoever yet has the audience laughing at the ridiculousness of the plot, characters and, to some extent, even the editing. From the description, it sounded as though it had the ingredients to be a decent thriller, but instead what I got from 'The Guest' was a bizarre mess of a film that had me laughing on several occasions. Favourite scenes (without spoiling the plot) are when he walks into the underage party carrying two barrels of beer for absolutely no reason, and when he storms into the Head Teacher (or Principal's) office with the mother after a few days of knowing the family. VERY unrealistic, but overall an enjoyable movie.Would NOT recommend this to anyone though.",The Guest
294,VolkerShmuley,Another military experiment gone wrong,4,25 December 2014,"Where do I begin? Bad acting? Predictable and cheap plot - written in an LA diner over a weekend? Was it an intention of a director to make a main character look like a D-Bag from the very second he appears on the screen? If it was then he definitely succeeded at least in that aspect of this excruciatingly awful movie. At some point I wished, that David, a main character who's going on a total rampage that makes no logical sense would save me from the pain of watching this movie and end my life. None of the characters managed to drive any empathy or relation to a viewer. Seemed like watching faceless people. I guess bad acting is to be blamed. What a time-waster this was. Wouldn't recommend to anyone. Please save yourself from boredom I've just experienced throughout this movie.",The Guest
295,Azmataz777,Starts well but spirals out of control,3,6 November 2015,"This movie actually started off well. An ex soldier turns up at his dead mates parents house as a tribute to his mate. He is welcomed and it appears that his mission is to look out for the family. He demonstrates this by beating up the sons bullies and framing the daughters abusive boyfriend of murder. He also helps stop the son for getting expelled and kills the Dad's boss so that the Dad immediately takes his spot. It all makes sense so far and this movie seems to have a clear direction. Then it all goes wrong. We discover that he is a wanted soldier and several cops go to the house to try and get him. He escapes, and in the process kills the Mum. Why? What is the point in that? Why didn't he just do it at the start of that was his aim? Then he drives off in the car and has a head on crash with the Dad. He then shoots him. Again, why? Why did he go through the trouble of getting the Dad promoted if he's just going to kill him anyway? It just doesn't make sense! Then he goes on a pursuit to kill the kids. Wasn't he helping them out before? Honestly, if he hadn't of killed any of the family this movie WOULD have worked. It would have got at least 7 stars. But the plot was just plain bad. It's like the writers gave up. This movie just ended up not having a purpose. Totally weird. I enjoyed the first 65% of the film but then it just became stupid. Have a watch and judge for yourself.",The Guest
296,blacklemore36,Immensely Enjoyable,7,2 December 2015,"People seem to be mixed on this movie, some find it too ridiculous and stupid, (which it kinda is) and some enjoy it like they would a John Carpenter flick. I fall in the latter. The movie boasts a fantastic soundtrack, the lead actor oozes charisma and screen presence, more than enough to root for him when you really shouldn't be. All the performances are superb. This movie may have a poor reveal to some, so be warned, the movie relishes in it's stupidity it's not afraid to be a little dumb. While it definitely has some evident flaws, This is a very fun and cheesy thriller. Don't create expectations while watching it, just sit back and enjoy the show.",The Guest
297,KennethMcGrath,Two Promising Young Actors Perform Naturalistically,7,4 December 2014,"The film itself has decent structure, direction, cinematography and an unsettling performance by Dan Stevens. Adam Wingard clearly got the script filmed with exactly the right level of tension but the back story on the main character needed more to provide the audience with a better ""reveal"". If the script had inverted structure or more accessible exposition, I think this movie could have been more.I think what caught my attention was the promise of the two younger actors: Brendan Meyer and Maika Monroe. These two made their characters seem completely believable even though the material wasn't challenging and I can envision them doing much more in the future. Brendan Meyer's performance was subtle enough for the camera that it played perfectly. I thought of his as his character and I believe that his character felt real. How much more can an actor deliver?Maika Monroe's performance answers that last question. Hers was a completely believable young woman, navigating her small town life, except her depth and presence on screen was more than was was written. I think she will be an actress with a wealthy career composed by better projects.Overall, the film was good, not great but it was entertaining.",The Guest
298,no_imagination4815162342,Oh Cousin Matthew...,7,13 September 2014,"So a guy who claims to know your dead son turns up at your house one day. He seems nice and looks like that bloke off of Downton so you let him stay for a while... That is pretty much all I knew about this film before I went to see it. What follows is an enjoyable thriller with laughs aplenty and an excellent central performance from Dan Stevens (more on that later).The plot, at the end of the day, is fairly nonsensical and there are some troubling loose ends that I found a little unsatisfactory. I can't say that any of the story is particularly surprising or original but what does that matter when everyone making it and everyone in the audience seems to be having so much fun? The cinema I was in was probably around half full and while there was nobody in full-on hysterical laughter, there was a satisfactory amount of appreciative chuckling (me included).I feel that the majority of my enjoyment of this film should really be credited to Dan Stevens in the main role. His character is charming, pleasant and helpful and yet strangely sinister and unsettling from the outset and he plays it absolutely perfectly. You can't help but like him even though you're not sure that you should. Apart from a smallish role in ""The Fifth Estate"", I am only familiar with Stevens from Downton Abbey and his role in this couldn't have been more different from both of these. I look forward to seeing how his career progresses but this was an excellent example of his versatility as an actor.Overall a good Saturday night out at the cinema but I can't imagine it is the kind of classic film I would watch again and again.",The Guest

300,Once-Upon-A-Time-I-Digress,Checks Out Too Soon,6,29 July 2015,"The Guest (2014) A family whose son died in combat are visited by one of his former comrades.The Guest is a ludicrous and funny thriller, with stand-out performances from Dan Stevens, Maika Monroe and Leland Orcer, who almost steals the show as the affable, alcoholic father. It has a dreamy synth-heavy soundtrack, reminiscent of both the 80's thrillers the film takes it's cues from and also Nicolas Winding Refn's Drive (2011).Adam Wingard paces the whole film tightly as possible, and even as the film goes into truly bonkers territory in it's third act, it never loses sharpness.My problem with The Guest is it sticks too rigorously to pastiche, when there's the makings of a film that could merely begin that way and transcend formula. The cast all are all perfectly in tune with the joke, the action sequences are exciting and brutal, the script has some hilariously dark and twisted turns, and yet it fails to subvert several genre tropes; the bullied kid at school, the stoners and a fair amount of dialogue all seem lifted from the films it sends up instead of parodied. The first half of The Guest promises a film that will surprise you, the second half slips back into a deadpan reheat. It's a shame, because everyone involved would be more than capable of pulling off something much more adventurous.*** A creepy treat which falls just short of delivering something more than a send-up.",The Guest
301,lordfinese,Over Rated B Movie,5,21 August 2016,"With a 6.7 rating on IMDb you would think this would be a decent movie, anything over 6.5 usually is, but, I am afraid it was over rated by many people on this board, people were voting to bump the movie, not with intentions of giving a balanced rating, so I have decided to give this a balanced rating instead of trying to bump it down by voting 1, which I have done to terrible overrated movies, like the Watchmen and others. This movie is decent, however, it is pretty good for a B movie, but one of problems is its setting, boring little town, which usually takes away from the movie, it also is a little unrealistic at certain points which I cannot specify in detail in order to stop spoilers. I have an excellent taste in the arts, so, I would say this movie should be rated at around 6, the 5 is a little bit of a bump down.",The Guest
302,trulstei,Why did you end it like that? Come on!,7,23 August 2016,"This movie is great, no doubt about it. I loved the actors, I loved the characters and I loved the story, that is until the last 10 seconds. I am sitting there hoping they will explain David's motives before the credits come up, maybe they include it somehow at the end? But nope, they don't, they just don't. So okay, that is fine, it was still a great movie all in all, but then the director does what must be the most awful decision in his career, I can imagine it going a something like this when Adam Wingard pitched the idea.Adam:""Hey, what if despite getting shot and stabbed twice, what if we..like, make David survive?""Literally anyone with a brain: ""What why? We just wrapped it up, the viewers still don't get the happy ending since so many died, and David would have to physically be dead by now.""Adam: ""But...wouldn't it be cool?""Literally anyone with a brain: ""Um..""Adam: ""That's it, we'll let him live #yolo""The ending makes no sense at all, and I was ready to give this the 9/10 it really deserved, even though they didn't really explain David's motives (which would make it a 10/10 for me), but nope, they had to ruin it in the last couple of seconds.I'm not sure if they did this to potentially have a sequel (something this movie doesn't need), or if it was just supposed to be a suspenseful cliffhanger that failed horribly, but it sure as hell didn't work.If there is something I've learned the last year as I've been rating movies it is that other critics can be harsh, but I'd rather be a little too nice than a bit too brutal on the score. That is not the case here though, I don't think it's fair to lower a score any further than I've done just because of 10 seconds out of a beautiful movie that had me hooked for 1 hour 39 minutes and 50 seconds, even if it's the ending.This movie is great, and I'll definitely watch it again. I'll recommend it, but I'll try to ignore the bad parts, such as the sort of weak story moments with the secret CIA guys we didn't really get explained either, David's reasons to do what he does, and the cliché ending that may could have worked in the 80's but was just too over the top for my taste now in the 2010's.And instead focus on the good parts such as the great introduction scenes, how well I liked all the characters (especially Spencer), and how much fun I had when David kicked those bullies' asses, and also when Luke hit that dude with a stick, that was also neat.These are my final words; watch this movie",The Guest

304,ernestosuarez,Oh boy...this isn't good!,1,22 June 2020,"I watched this movie because I watched a youtube video of hidden gems on Netflix then saw the high ratings! How it got those ratings I have no clue! There are so many plot holes in this movie! The movie starts with a lot of potential then just completely falls apart. My review will contsin spoilers, so if you are planning to watch it, this would be a good time to stop reading.The acting in this movie is B material with a couple recognizable faces probably added to give some credibility to the movie. The plot is the whole stranger shows up and is not the good guy people think he is. One of the biggest problems I had with this movie is the characters action made no sense and wouldn't be how someone would reasonably act! For instance, David (the titles guest) shows up at the door of the Peterson's home where Laura (mama Peterson) answers and lets him in. We find out he served in the military with Laura's son and was with him when he was killed in action. So what does mama do? She invites him to stay the night in her dead sons room which, by the looks of it, never changed after her son left for the military! Really? The Leland (dad) comes home and initially has a problem with him there but has a beer and he is ok with it. Keep in mind that this is a good looking man he doesn't know and Dad is comepletely fine with it despite having a 20 yr old daughter (Anna) living there and of course his wife. Ya...not happening, yet it did! As the movie progresses we get to see David isn't who everyone thinks he is. After initially helping out the family, he helps Luke (the son) with his bullies David decides he needs to buy a gun. We get to watch a scene where he meets a gun dealer, decides he wants all the dealers weapons. Instead of buying them (the movie hints that this guy has alot of cash) he kills the dealer and his friend for no apparent reason. Why? Niether of these guys knew anything about his ""secret"" and he had the cash to buy them all. Why murder them and draw unwanted police attention. In another part of the movie we find out he murdered Dad's boss and his bosses wife to help Dad het a promotion. Of course he made it look like a suicide so nobody is the wiser. Anna decides somethings up with David so she does some snooping and finds out David died in a fire some time back! She then asks her brother (Luke) to do some internet detective work. Then we get a scene where Luke confronts David in a scene that makes no sense at all! He tells David that he knows he killed his the gun dealers and his dads boss and wife. He also knows he isn't who he says he is. Then tells him he is completely fine with it and his secret is safe with him. Keep in mind he just told him his sister asked him to snoop around and she thinks David is a murderer! Nice brother you got there Anna!A secret government group then visits Mom. She is outside the house hanging laundry and David helps but heads back to the house just as a two big black SUVs arrive. Major Carver questions Mom then David reapears and proceeds to start shooting at the HEAVILY armed men picking them off as he goes. He runs back into the house as Mom stands around in shock. The government guys begin to completely unload there (i think they are AK's, im not good at recognizing firearms) AK-47s on the house, hundreds of rounds are raining down on the house. What does Mom do? Run? Take cover behind one of the SUV's? Nope...she runs into the house the that is being turned into swiss cheese...really! She is eventually killed by Davis who is apparently wearing a bullet deterent because no rounds hit him, except for one that buzzed his leg. David is also a great shot, he hits everything he shoots. Also, the heavily armed government guys aren't wearing any protective gear, no body armour...ya, that makes sense! Eventually David makes it to a vehicle and thats when we get an absolutly ridiculous editing job. As he drives away from the house, David shoots the tires out on both SUVs, you see the tires hit and that side of the vehicle quickly lowes to the ground making them undrivable! Not 5 seconds later we see the Major hop into one of the SUVs, which now appears to have 4 completely intact tires. A shot from above as he is pulling away shows that both of the SUVs tires was untouched! What? The Major gives chase and isn't very far behind, David has about a 5 second lead. The we get a cut where we see Dad on the long dirt road driving home. David is coming the opposite direction. Instead of tring to drive past Dad, David decides to hit him head on. What? The Major is on his tale, why do this. He gets out of the vehicle completely unscathed then walks over to Dad as shoots him! All i could think of during this scene was ""where is the Major? He was right behind him and now he is nowhere to be seen"". David then goes to the resturaunt where Anna and her friend (who he boned earlier) work. He asks her friend where Anna is and she says she doesn't know. He then shoots and kills her in the middle of the resturaunt in front of the other customers and walks out. As he is leaving he takes out two gernades and tosses them on the floor blowing up the entire building. Why shoot the girl if you were gonna just blow the building up anyway? Ya...that makes sense.The final scene is at Lukes high schools haunted house where he is working off a punishment. All our characters arrive. David kills the teacher watching Luke, then he kills the Major. David chases Anna and Luke around the maze. Anna and Luke decide to split up. Eventually Anna gets the drop on David when she finds the Majors gun. With a fog machine going Anna shoots David in the shoulder, he falls down and is covered by the fog. When Anna walks to where he dropped, the fog (which is about knee high) parts and David is gone. He then attacks her and pushes her to the ground, how she didn't see him get up and move is beyond me because he was directly in front of her. As he is trying to strangle Anna on the ground Luke stabs him in the back with a knife David gave him earlier. After getting stabbed in the back, he stands up and Luke stabs him in the chest leaving the knife inside him. He falls and ""dies""! Problem solved! Cut to EMTs taking care of the two of them. Firemen, Detectives, Police and EMTs are all over the scene. We hear a fireman tell the detective there were two bodies inside and one had his teeth broken out. Hmmm....there should be 3 bodies! We then see firemen exit the building and one has a limp! Guess who it is...its David in a firemen suit! So where did that guys body go? David must be super human! He gets shot in the leg, gets in a high speed head on collision, shot in the shoulder, and stabbed in the back and chest. Yet only has a limp! During the course of things we find out David is part of some secret experiment but no details are given. I was gonna give it the benefit of the doubt and assume this experiment gave his some type of super healing powers but I had to toss that asside. Cuz if thst were the case, why is he still limping from the very first wound he got?The movie ends there. There is so much more I could have included but this review is already long enough as it is! Do not believe the high ratings...there is no way they could be real. The movie has no redeeming qualities. The acting is awful as well. Watch at your own risk!",The Guest

Yes, he claims he knew their son, but he never explains why he came to their home!!! I've never sat thru' a whole episode of Downton Abbey, so missed the 'Dan Stevens' era! He is very convincing in this movie role. In fact, although I accepted Tom Cruise as 'Jack Reacher', I believe Dan could have been just as good! Loved the 'humour'....although the violence seemed to contradict the successful attempts at it, because it's definitely NOT a comedy!!! A very good 'debut' by Dan!

The brooding new wave synth soundtrack and even the score seemed to come directly from that generation's sound bank.The dialogue was pretty cheesy and acting was quite sub-par.It wasn't the worst thing I have ever seen, but I am a little disappointed.

308,taylorthormod,"First 2/3 were good but not great, last 1/3 or so was fantastic.",8,3 October 2021,"So in the first 2/3 there were quite a few cringe, cliche, and corny moments. For example they tried to hint that the ""guest"" had some sort of unknown evil intentions by having him stare at nothing very menacingly which I found funny, especially since it happened like more than 5 times. There were also just a few moments that I think could have been done a bit differently in order to achieve a better result. But aside from those few moments here and there, I think the first 2/3 were great. I have practically no complaints about the last 30 mins or so of this movie. Nothing but praise. This section of my review might get a little into the spoiler territory but I'll try to keep things vague to avoid spoilers. So the last 30 mins starts with a chase sequence with lots of action and I have no complaints about it. The second half of the end of the movie is, in my opinion, the best thing about the whole movie. The scene at the Halloween dance is amazing. The cinematography is fantastic. The music really works well with this sequence and makes it even better. The almost horror aspect of this segment is great, I love it. And the very last few seconds of the film are fantastic. I'm not gonna spoil anything but it's really great. Love the classic horror movie vibe that this film has. The font of the title, the credits, the visual aspects, even the costume design and stuff. Most parts it feels modern but with some it really feels like you're watching an 80s horror movie. But overall it's a pretty good movie. My review may have made it sound like only the end was good but that's not the case. The whole thing was really good, very enjoyable, just a few cringey moments but other than that there was nothing wrong with it. The later parts of the movie just made it even better. I'm giving The Guest an 8/10, more precisely I'd say 88%.",The Guest
309,thetransmutator,Total B Movie Genius,8,10 March 2015,"This movie clearly has a small budget and is casted with no name actors we barely recognize except for the ""David"" character which apparently used to be on Downtown Abbey, a very popular show I refused to watch.The movie starts out as unrealistically as you can imagine. A naive middle Americana family just allows this total stranger to stay at their house for as long as he likes because he served with their deceased son in the military and the photo in their living room proved it.Without safety precautions or logical common sense both parents basically allows this complete stranger free reign over their home, kids, and even allows him to drive their car and mentor their troubled son. The only person with enough common sense to check on David's back story is the 20 year old daughter whose single phone call to the military checking up on him unravels a series of events that makes for one of the better action b-movies I've seen in a long time.Yes, it's low budget, predictable, and corny, but it's very exciting, bloody, heart pumping and satisfies your guiltiest B movie pleasures.",The Guest
310,nicoleahern,Major Disappointment,2,23 November 2014,"The trailer to this seemed good, and I anticipated something similar to Killer Joe perhaps, but it turned out to be tacky, obvious and a generally badly executed film.The music is that of a 80's B-movie, even with a dated and tacky title font, and the acting isn't much better. The whole thing feels stiff, with Dan Stevens obviously trying to make a change from his known Downton Abbey Role, but the sinister glares seemed over-the-top and theatrical.The plot is very thin, with unnecessary explanations, and a poor excuse behind the leads motif. You don't connect or sympathise with any of the characters particularly, so it is hard to stay engrossed. It is tiresome to watch a film where someone discovers there is a bad guy on the loose but everyone just ignores their warnings, it just feels a little lazy in the writing.Then the Halloween set up at the end tries to push it toward a horror, rather than simply a thriller, which is what it was (supposedly).Not often I say this, but I don't even recommend the watch.I'm surprised it received a 7.2 star rating also. It's a shame because I feel the actors all had a lot more potential .Praying for no sequel. Praying people watch some decent films and learn to score better.",The Guest

If you are expecting a masterpiece that makes you question morality, ethics or some deeper meaning of life. However, if you are looking for pure entertainment with great acting, then you should check this movie out.Dan Stevens was amazing. He played his part to absolute perfection. One of those mysterious bad guys that you shouldn't root for, but you cannot help yourself.While the premise of the movie is somewhat predictable, the directors still create drama and anticipation. Their use of music to enhance several scenes was spot on. My personal favorites were the ""Haunted"" song playing with the close up of Dan and the ending with ""Anthonio"" was very powerful.Overall, the movie keeps a steady pace and keeps you entertained with exceptional acting and dark humor.

315,curtis_davies55,My Favourite 2014 Movie So Far!,10,5 November 2014,"First off before i went to watch this movie i got very familiar with Director Adam Wingard through both with 'V/H/S' shorts and a short in 'The Abc's Of Death and then 'You're Next' which i loved so I went into the guest with high expectations and believe me it didn't let me down. The style and direction along with Dan Stevens powerhouse performance made this film one of my favourites. As a massive fan of 80's horror movies i was happy with what Adam Wingard did with it. The way he bends different genres together is incredible, you have action, horror, thriller and even some comedy. Dan Stevens Character David is so iconic that he's up there with Patrick Bateman for me, His character is brilliant and very quotable. Another brilliant aspect of the movie is the build up, its not one bit boring and really tense, just watching David is entertaining. For me i give this movie 10 stars easily!",The Guest
316,mikehoward-123-837839,What a con.,3,13 December 2014,"Oh dear. After a promising start, this film suddenly turns into a pretty awful B movie.It's as if the writer and the director started making a movie, got a bit bored, and resorted to any stupid whim they had just to get it finished.The last half hour or so is shockingly bad. If the movie had started out like this, then you wouldn't have got suckered in to watching til the end, unless you're a fan of cheap 80s rubbish.And to make it worse, it's accompanied by some godawful music.It's a mess.",The Guest

318,markosremac-247-329502,Pleasant surprise,7,23 February 2015,I started watching this movie without many expectations. The story starts slowly but is puzzling all the time. When You watch You constantly know that something should start to go wrong but the story simply doesn't reveal itself too soon and it keeps You trilled for a long time.Acting is good and music really fits in great.I read the reviews here after watching the movie because the movie did left a bit of a question mark in the air. People are divided in opinions. Some like the movie and some don't. If You don't expect something special and You like genre like this than watching this will be good time investment.,The Guest
319,ivanpremec,Shallow movie as is this review,3,19 August 2015,"Sorry to say this, the actors are nice by their looks but there's nothing much to the movie which will make you feel that time was not wasted.The story is OK in sense of slowly getting you into the setting but for too long you don't know much and then suddenly it's blood & gore everywhere. The movie is over before you know anything and it's not deep enough to let you wonder what-who-where-when-why or whatnot..If you wanted bad guy you'd watch Halloween. If you wanted retribution or something like that you'd watch Agent 47. Here we have mixed feelings with nothing left to think about in the end because you don't get revealed materials to think about. So you're left stranded in thought ""how do I feel now after watching it"" and you're just feeling nothing.Overall, it could have been like 5-6 but meh.. it's mellow with too much ""american"" in it in the end.. sorry people nothing to see here, move along...",The Guest

322,PodreySanchez,Entertaining until the very end.,8,21 February 2016,"The Guest is a very underrated film that will end up being a cult classic of new wave modern horror. Stylistically it feels very simular to Nicolas Winding Refn's noireish artistic film making with the use of synthpop to set the tone, established by films such as Bronson and Drive. This film is very subtle, as things only connect if you really listen and take notice of characters dialogue and intentions. You never know whether 'the Guest' is truly looking out for his hosts, or whether his plan was set in motion from the first time they met. But what is certain is that he never second guesses his decisions once hes made them. Speaking of which, the film is unexpectedly gruesome and none forgiving for it. Which might catch many people of guard. But I found that it needed that sudden switch to up the stakes just at the point where it started being a bit sameish to other teen thriller film I've seen in the past. Overall, The Guest is a great film that has went under too many radars, and deserves way more recognition.",The Guest

327,mwaz-33830,Departure from Downton for Dan Stevens,6,7 September 2021,"This movie was for me best summarized by a quote from Hamlet ""One may smile, and smile, and be a villain"". I think that about sums up Dan Stevens performance here. Pretty face and excellent manners, familial connection and he is through the door in the first five minutes. I have seen other reviewers comment and I agree, it's as if he was trying to prove he had something other then Downton in him and this is about as polar opposite a character as you can get. For me this was neither a great film nor a terrible one. I don't regret watching it, but I probably won't watch it again. I mostly watched it to see Dan Stevens. For most of the film the majority of the main casts portrayal of the characters is tepid at best. Oddly enough the character who is supposedly least emotive ""David"" ie Dan Stevens character, is the one you get the most from. I think that the plot was a little slow and it drops you in the middle and then hastily tries to explain itself near the end. It would have been interesting to learn more about ""David's"" origins. Plus the ending was such a horror movie troupe, I really literally about rolled my eyes. Still an interesting excursion for Dan Stevens from his Downton Abbey character universe. After seeing his acting there and here one can't help feeling that served with a better script and director he might make something really memorable in the antihero department.",The Guest

I recommend going into this movie without any spoilers on it, There are twists that you don't want to be spoiled. In all this movie had everything you don't see often in movies, and that is what makes it my favorite movie of 2014/2015.

It was the most incredible BAD AND WORST MOVIE. I started to laugh at some point. It was ....Jeeeezzzz...... I have no words about this movie.

This is true review from someone who likes to watch movies for nothing other that the entertainment factor.... and I can tell you this movie absolutely sucked! There is no way this movie was made in 2014 as it has a complete 80's vibe and not it a good way. The music was boring and uneventful and the acting was horrible and cheesy.

333,iwasmefirst,Mixed up mess,3,7 August 2015,"I know that I tend to like some pretty weird and wonderful and somewhat 'niche' films, so I have and odd system for telling if a film is actually good, and that is whether or not I would recommend it to my parents. For the first 30-40 minutes this film was winning, it was a thriller, the leading man (who I've never actually seen in downtown abbey) was doing well, with his creepy yet polite local neighbour psychopath act. It's clear from fairly early on (and the trailer), that he is not as clean cut as he seems, however he genuinely does seem to be helping out the family. Then comes the military conspiracy plot line. I was originally expecting a straight up 'he's not who he says he is', which would have been difficult because he is in picture with the dead man he claims to have been friends with. But I really didn't like the whole 'military conspiracy', which is never totally explained. And then despite having gone to murderous lengths to help this family he decides he'd rather go out of his way to kill them. Fine, I'll deal with that. But they have to wind up at the Halloween maze dance. Which doesn't even have an emergency exit? Health and safety would have a field day with that one. And finally I was just starting to get on board with the brother/sister combo who got sh&t done (which let's face it, is rare in horror films, especially when they've decided to end with the full blow cliché like here), and they wreck the whole thing in the last 5 seconds. So in summary, started off as a slow burning thriller with actual potential, and wound up as a mindless slasher film running round the clichéd maze (literally).",The Guest

The director has clearly studied 70s and 80s cult movies very closely and incorporated all the right elements, but that's exactly the result; a pastiche thats trying really hard to be cult, but ends up failing because of it. 
There are some great moments, but the plot is incoherent, stumbling from camp thriller to psychedelic slasher with no sense of direction. The same goes for the acting, which ranges from tense and serious to deliberately hammy. 
Overall, this movie is a mess. It's not unwatchable, but it's extremely irritating, as it could have been so much better.",The Guest

I thought ow my God, finally great thriller... Even one of the reviews has subject ""the best movie that he/she's watch ever""... no, no, no. This movie is really, really bad! And I can't stop asking my self what is wrong with the audience?? It is predictable, it is almost amateur movie. The fight is so unreal. The acting is bad. There is nothing interesting happening in this movie. The story line is like an 90- teen teenage scary movie. The general story: He (the guest) is former soldier and he is visiting the family of his dead soldier mate, and the family off course offers him to stay for a while. And guess what - he (the ex-soldier) is psycho. And when they (the family) figures out that he is ""bad person"", he starts to kill everyone... Well, this is interesting: when he (the guest) gave his knife to the kid(the younger brother of his soldier mate), I've immediately knew that in the end, the kid will kill the bad ex-soldier with his own knife...

An unimaginative plot line and virtually no character build up. You just can't really care about these people as you know so little about most of them. And what's this thing with Americans and guns? As with so many US movies this ends in a massive shoot out. The twist at the end is risible, to say the least.An ideal movie to watch with pizza, a few beers and friends. When you want something in the background that you don't really have to concentrate on to follow - it's that predictable..",The Guest
338,xboxgamer98,The guest is here and he is welcome to stay,8,21 July 2015,When I heard about this movie about a year ago I was not sure if it was going to be a good film or a bad film. I can now happily say that this film is not just good but it is great.This film keeps you questioning what is going on from the start. This film always makes sure you are on the edge of your seat. Giving you minor breathers at some parts making sure that the tension does not become to much.I want to make sure that Dan Stevens gets a lot of praise for his performance in this film. If the lead actor was not very talented or was bland then this film could of fell apart from the very beginning. But with a terrific performance from Dan Stevenes you always questioning what is happening just like the director intended.Another thing in this film that is superb is the music it is very different and very creepy at times keeping the tension flowing and actually giving a good insight to the lead characters psyche.One thing that I felt was a little out of place was the twist. To me it felt a little forced and like the director needed something to create conflict. But unfortunately the introduction of the twist made me feel like I started watching a different film for about ten minutes and then it fit in fine but the introduction was a little off putting. Another problem I have with the film without spoiling it is the ending. This is because to me it felt a little hit too cliché and actually a bit of a cheat ending considering what the audience has just been through.Finally the action that is in this filmed is very well directed and there is not actually to many cuts in between the action. The director definitely showed he knows how to film action without having to use shaky cam.Overall this film is very good and I believe it is a must watch for anyone into thrillers.8/10,The Guest

Guy shows up at the house of the fallen soldier identifying himself a fellow soldier/friend, there to honour the soldiers dying wishes to take care of his family.But it's clear something is off. Creepy. Just not right. The tension builds nicely.Then all of a sudden, in the blink of an eye the movie becomes ""Rambo acts like Michael Myers""It becomes comically dark and over the top dismal with left and right slayings, cartoonish military battles at a rural home. It just got ...weird?It's really too bad. The first half was really great and I was thinking that it was going to be more of a slow building premise where the guest was lying, turns the family against each other, all for some secondary gain.Have they stuck with a more realistic slow building second half plot this would have been a fantastic film.

Then you get to the last 20 minutes of the film and suddenly you feel like you're some B-grade 80's film that has poached a dubbed soundtrack from a Jap version of TopGun.A dodgy soundtrack and a very cheesy kill scene at the end absolutely murdered this movie as well as gravity to the acting of it's cast, producers or directors. There is no coming back from the bad make-up, prosthetics and blood work as well as the poorly constructed scenery and acting in the final scene!DO NOT WATCH THIS RUBBISH.

345,cells-215-900895,Well worth the watch even despite some flaws!,7,17 January 2015,"The acting is great, the soundtrack fantastic and the atmosphere the movie creates sucks you in from the very beginning. The movie keeps you guessing throughout at least for the first hour or so. You KNOW something is off but you have no idea what exactly. When I watched it my theory of what was going on changed every 10 minutes :D As the last reviewer stated the first hour is definitely the best part. Unfortunately towards the end the writers kind of dropped the ball. The ending is somewhat unsatisfactorily predictable and the story can only go the way it goes because of absolutely ridiculous mistakes made by some of the characters. I don't know why most movies foam in the endings but I guess in this case it is something that I'm very willing to endure for the fun I had during the first 2/3 of the film.The acting is awesome for the most part. Dan Stevens does a great job keeping you on the edge the whole time which is utterly entertaining. The writing and dialogue are great except as mentioned above for the somewhat disappointing ending. But all in all this movie stuck with me and though it has been a couple of days since I watched it I still ""feel"" the atmosphere it created (to a great extend due to its unconventional soundtrack, which I eventually bought although it is generally not my kind of music at all). This is a very good movie and I am a little surprised that I basically had to stumble over it by accident and it hasn't gotten more publicity.

348,rykelly,Should it be this funny?,8,24 July 2015,"I must confess i knew little about The Guest before watching it last night, i was recommended it by a close friend who compared it to Winding Refn's film Drive. A comparison i began to understand as soon as the electronic soundtrack and stylistic cinematography merged together.However, that is about as far as the comparison goes between the two films, because (and this is not easy) The Guest was hilarious. Adam Wingard has managed to direct a film that work's better as a comedy (dark) than it does as a thriller/horror. I'm not completely sure this was intentionally, but if it was then it's a work of genius! The film for me pay's homage to some of the great B Movies that one would see in the 80's and that would transpire to be cult classics.Dan Stevens character David (lead protagonist) is brilliant, pure evil and is perfectly juxtapositioned within the Peterson family. It was also great to see Lance Reddick (of The Wire fame) back as a high ranking police officer.

351,duanegoode,"A Caller Who Just ""Wanted To Help""",7,18 June 2019,"This tightly paced action thriller uses an extraordinary mash-up of influences from various genres of old movies to entertain in a stylised fashion that's guaranteed to please nostalgia freaks and the many fans who will find its combination of horror, dark humour and suspense completely irresistible. Its straightforward set-up creates an expectation of what's to follow and that's exactly what's delivered in a plot that's completely devoid of any real twists or surprises but is nevertheless redeemed to a great extent by the charismatic Dan Stevens, some exceptionally well-executed action sequences and the subtle and well managed way in which the tension early on the movie is allowed to develop and grow so naturally before the point at which things really start to heat up.Recently discharged Army Sergeant David Collins (Dan Stevens) calls at the home of Laura Peterson (Sheila Kelley) whose son Caleb had been killed in the Afghanistan war and as well as describing how Caleb was feeling at the time of his death, tells the distressed Laura that he and Caleb were good friends and points to a photograph that she has on display in her home in which he's standing close to her son. David is soft-spoken, well mannered and polite and Laura invites him to stay overnight so that he can tell the rest of the family about Caleb's time in the Army.Caleb's younger brother Luke (Brendan Meyer) quickly bonds with David who becomes his protector against a group of boys who regularly bully him at his High School and Caleb's father, who self-medicates heavily with alcohol and has work problems, also starts to enjoy David being around. On the other hand, Caleb's teenage sister Anna (Maika Monroe) doesn't take to the family's new houseguest so readily and treats him with considerable caution. Despite this, she allows herself to be persuaded to take him to a party at her friend Kristen's (Tabatha Shaun) house where he deals very effectively with a problem that his hostess has with her difficult ex-boyfriend and then sleeps with her.Now enjoying an apparently open-ended stay at the Petersons' place and having favourably impressed almost everyone, David even briefly softens Anna's resistance when he makes positive comments about her tastes in music and shows off his impressive physique when he emerges from the shower at her home. Despite all this, Anna's suspicions persist and when she makes a call to an Army base to find out more about David, sets off the dramatic, spectacular and terrifying sequence of events that propel the story to its crazy conclusion which neatly paves the way for a sequel.With echoes of ""The Terminator"" (1984) and a number of John Carpenter influences (the action's even set in the ""Halloween"" period), ""The Guest"" features a character that's similar to those played by Mark Wahlberg in ""Fear"" (1996) and Rebecca De Mornay in ""The Hand That Rocks The Cradle""(1992). The plot resembles that of Alfred Hitchcock's ""Shadow of a Doubt"" (1943) and the hall of mirrors sequence is reminiscent of a memorable part of Orson Welles' ""The Lady from Shanghai"" (1947). Depending on the viewer's point of view, this type of ""cut and paste"" movie-making could be seen as either rampant plagiarism or a glorious example of unbridled postmodernism. Either way, the result is highly entertaining, disarmingly simple and at times, surprisingly humorous.",The Guest

There were so many holes in this movie all the way through the ending. The acting was subpar and there was no character development and backstory at all. Just some random guy who was friends with the protagonists' dead son/brother in the military.Not sure where they were trying to go with this one but if you are looking for time to waste because you have nothing better to do, then you may get a kick out of the action.

362,josephmcandrew,"Darkly comical, ultra-violent and stylish as hell!",8,30 June 2015,"Wow! What a gem of a movie. The Guest tells a tale of a mysterious and initially benign-appearing ex-military man who claims to have served with the recently deceased son of the Peterson family. Still grieving their loss, they welcome him with open arms. All is not as it seems however and slowly, despite his psychopathic charm, young Anna Peterson suspects that something is amiss.What follows is a slick and stylish thriller with fluid action scenes that simmers at first before leading us to an explosive finale. The acting is solid throughout, especially from the two leads Dan Stevens and Maika Monroe who share a nice chemistry. The story, whilst simplistic and sometimes cheesy, is tight and the terse dialogue fits well. Character motivations are deliberately left vague and the film remains focused on the fact it is a thriller and doesn't overburden us with ridiculous a back-story; what back-story there is merely serves as a plot device to set-up the finale. And what a finale! Without giving spoilers, it is one of the most stylish final movie set-pieces I've seen in a long time, interjected with just the right amount of tongue-in-cheek quips. Just shows what can be done with the right set, some nerves and a smoke machine; who needs CGI!A special mention must be given to the excellent soundtrack which really enhances the tension in some of the key scenes. At times I swore the bass beats were synced with my heart-rate!Highly enjoyable and highly recommended!",The Guest

This film is truly awful, i have no experience of seeing the main actor in downton abbey but on the evidence of this film he needs to stick with that show. Acting terrible from all involved, story very poor with no real look into any of the back story of the main character or why he even turns up to the families house in the first place.

Stick with the English accent as well buddy. His performance was absolutely embarrassing. Portraying a role where he is supposed to be Borne-like force is not a role to pursue in the future. The plot was elementary, the music was ear wrenching and the ""thrill"" scenes were so predictable. The acting overall was Busch league. The action scenes were equivalent to back yard wrestling videos posted on you tube. Im talking about the videos that were posted before backyard wrestling was even remotely worthy of being watched. This should have been an entry level marketed film. I am unbelievably dumbfounded by the amount of great reviews this movie has.

365,yukihime23,"Unrealistic and predictable storyline with major flaws, poor acting",1,5 October 2015,"I have never written a review here before but seeing all the great reviews on this film I though I contribute: This is honestly one of the worst films I have ever seen. The story is not only predictable but quite unrealistic at points. A family invites a complete stranger to stay with them without actually checking who he is (ok, he points at a picture saying 'That's me' so it may only be me who does not find this sufficient as proof of identity)? No one seems to think about David's own family, they may want to see him after his discharge too? In a blink of an eye he becomes the confidant of pretty much everyone? I get the idea that the Petersons in a way see their dead son in him - it just does not work in a believable manner. The rebellious daughter's investigation about David's identity is a joke. The military's response to her investigation is an even bigger one. The unit that is after David is ridiculously incompetent. So is the Major. The ending where two teenagers finish him, doing what a military unit couldn't? And these are just a handful of points...this film is full of such flaws or much rather made up only of flaws.The acting is not good at all and the music usually does not fit any of the scenes.The basic idea of the film could work - after all that's why we picked this film to watch - however it would need a lot more effort, thought, details, elaboration put into it then this piece.",The Guest

It is very slow moving to build up to the action as the action does take place about at end of the movie. Only thing really confused the hell out of me is the trailer, all music choices, and logo design, coming from a filmmaker I'd would have chosen much more modernized feeling music during the movie and especially the logo design feel like it was intentionally designed to have this movie feel and look like a 80s, early 90s movie except the acting/visual effects, etc. were all modernized. So the movie felt very confusing from feeling like it was edited by or intentionally to feel like an 80s/early 90s movie but then directed, acted, etc. modern. From a filmmaker's standpoint it is too confusing and know it would confuse most people watching this, but the plot is very well done I think most people like myself even was interested in the story and its characters even with the very bad and annoying choices of music playing during most of the movie.",The Guest

Even if you watch this movie with an artist's eye there's no finesse. Just mediocrity all over the place. The script itself isn't that bad but everything else smells of Halloween after school special with the main character inspired by Ryanj Gosling movies dressed with a soundtrack inspired from Drive without Kavisnky.If you're having a few drinks with friends potentially this could be entertaining but I'm sure there are many other movies that can do the job much better than this.Don't waste your time.,The Guest

376,Nametaken137,An excellent step for Adam Wingard,8,21 August 2015,"The Guest ReviewThose of you truly invested into the horror genre might well remember director Adam Wingard and writer Simon Barrett from their appearance in the horror anthology, The ABC's of Death, in which they directed, wrote and stared in the segment Q is for quack. Those that include themselves in this sphere might well note the duo's unique oblique combination of comedy and horror, which again arises, albeit rather sheepishly, in their newest film The Guest. Those of you who are unfamiliar with their short segment, might surely remember their 2013 horror film You're Next; a slightly clumsy cross between Cabin in the Woods and The Strangers, that seemed to adhere far too much to conventional horror plot lines. However, with their newest film The Guest, Wingard and Barrett pleasantly surprise us with a film that approaches the fringes of horror without actually crossing the line, teasing our interest with a killer soundtrack and stunning visual pallet. Although the plot at times alludes to actual fact and explanation, it does so on purpose for the sake of comedy, almost poking fun at a convention of films that has at its centre an anti-hero born out of an underground government experiment. Played by Dan Stevens, (Downtown Abbey) the film follows the anti-hero simply known as 'David' and his relationship to the Peterson family. Stevens, who portrays a discharged solider in search of his recently deceased friends family, introduces a certain kind of caution towards the film, persuading the viewer that all might not be so innocent. The plot persists in building this caution like a symphonic crescendo, until the systematic sequences of mild violence accumulate towards an all-out murder rampage towards the end. However, this is where The Guest's largest downside presents itself. The inertia that sped up considerably towards the end of the film, created a certain kind of rushed effect that although possibly deliberate, could have been handled with more care with an extension of 20 minutes screen time. The script slowly unravels the mystery we're initially introduce to, but with Lance Reddick's character appearing 30 minutes from the end of the film to reveal all, we are rushed through an explanation of David's downfall. It is important to note however that the performance that Stevens ultimately offers, carries the film beautifully as the film progresses, visually transforming the way we perceive the main character as we find out more and more that the initially polite and friendly man we were first introduced to, might not be as such. The alternative performances offered by Maika Monroe and Sheila Kelley, also hold firm as positive right till the end credits role, and remain a testament to how well the casting was handled in connection to the characters first presented in the script. The brilliance of this movie, more so than both the plot and characters, is the chosen soundtrack and pallet that work precisely in tandem with one another. The 80's synth introduced by the Peterson daughter creates an ambiance that presents itself within the presentation of film itself. The use of pink and purple as the main colour pallet, specifically in the Halloween party end scene, allow us to imagine the big screen we're watching the film on is lit from above with neon signs glowing ominously. It also provides the 80's feel that the soundtrack succeeds in executing, displacing us between the modern period we know the characters live in, and the atmosphere the audio presents. Lastly, the comedy that was ever so prevalent in Q is for Quack, and morbidly misplaced in You're Next, excels in its attempts to play with what we might expect or think might happen. It dances with the audience's expectations, elevating moments of tension for a laugh, making the next time an action sequence is presented all the more tense because the audience is at a crossroads between knowing whether the anti-hero might smile or kill a character. All these points make it hard to judge The Guest as harshly as the directing and writing duo's previous attempts in film, and remain a positive step in the right direction for both film makers. Although their next announced film presents a step backwards from this movement, as they attempt to re-make the almost perfect Korean film, I Saw The Devil, we eagerly await to what else Wingard and Barrett bring to the horror world.

377,TimVC,Visually beautiful but unoriginal mash of violence,5,22 July 2019,"The myriad references to other films like The Terminator and Jason Bourne show how unoriginal this flick truely is. Although well acted and masterfully filmed, the plot is simply a little too predictable.The positives about this film are well known to those who read other reviews here: David (Dan Stevens) is portrayed by a strong, charismatic actor who keeps you watching till the end. The good-looking characters, locations and outfits are all neatly displayed by a professional team of film makers. (Though I would be utterly surprised to find a waitress wearing a stunning outfit like that in real life.)The catch, however, is the predictable truth behind the mysterious smile of main character David. I guessed he could either be a cyborg, a mutant, or some other superhuman creature. He turns out to be a military experiment by the government, my oh my. Accompanied by the obligate wave of violence and nearly indestructible qualities of the anti-hero (himself, David) in the story.Ideologically, this movie is not far away from a glorification of violence and war. It seems logical that the viewer will root for the irresistible David, who lures every character towards weapons or drugs/alcohol. This character type could have been interesting, if it hadn't been used a million times before. The mould of an attractive, rebellious but lethal protagonist has been explored many times in the past.As the film's income didn't surpass its budget, it's safe to say that it is more suitable as an example for upcoming directors of photography (hence the professional visuals) than for an average audience capable of predicting David's unrealistic martial art skills from miles away.",The Guest

The plot was the worst part. It was extremely bogus and predictable and confusing. Explain yourself damnit. I finished the movie feeling like it was a comedy and not a thriller. At no point was I on edge or shocked or scared. The only part I did like was the old school thriller music and the vibes in the school dance scene. The actor who played is pretty good looking but that's about the extent to interest in this movie. I guess if you're bored it is okay but definitely don't expect anything insanely amazing.

I wasted over an hour of my life watching this film which contains poor acting and a plot that is an amalgamation of every cliché in the action thriller genre. The acting was not good and although the storyline seems like it was meant to be a wide and entertaining piece was instead methodically boring. Cant believe people would recommend this but the real tragedy is that the so called critics rate this highly. If you like good movies like the Bourne series or Shooter then skip this movie. If you wear a helmet to school and like licking windows then this film is for you. When someone criticizes another persons' work people return fire with: ""You think you could do better?""

Every single character in this movie is a one dimensional automaton, not least of all the antagonist who is basically just a (SPOILER) Terminator sent back in time to kill Sarah Connor's arms dealer and set up her poor dumb drug dealer. The poor actress playing the mom had to deal with the same lazy writing that every weak judge in every awful court drama has to deal with, except ""I'll allow it"" has been replaced with a kaleidoscope of 'oh sure. whatever you say -person-'. In fact the Guest even has a trench-coat wearing (despite the blinding sun) government shadow-ops (or whatever) soldier/team- leader/catalyst who predictably lives just long enough to fill in the gaping holes in the Guests' plot. Everyone is just another domino waiting to be toppled. I also wasn't big into the action, gun toting, Bourne-again delivery. To be fair, I am not a fan of gun porn anyway, and action movies are notoriously bad at character development. Still, I didn't feel like my disbelief was suspended for more than the first ten minutes. The only thing that elevates it for me is that on occasion the Terminator guy would deliver his lines in such a way that it seemed like at least he knew what this movie was, even if it otherwise wasn't intended to be so self-aware.",The Guest
384,brugoes,Surprisingly good horror film with campy components,8,13 March 2014,Don't go in to this movie expecting a movie like SAW. I suggest going in to this movie just to enjoy it and not just to get scared. This movie was a horror film but it's more campy than scary. The cheesiness is on purpose and styles against 1980s horror films. The music in this movie is really great. The way they blend music and film was pretty awesomely done. The overall movie has a cheesy vibe but it's really well done and enjoyable. It's even funny in the most gripping moments. There is also a pretty awesome horror scene at the end involving magic mirrors and clowns like any kid's original nightmares.

But what really made this movie stand out for me, was the excellent use of the songs. Mainly Electro/SynthWave tunes that really heightened the retro feel of the movie. It is clear that through this the flick is not for everyone, but if you're a child of the 80s you'll appreciate the overall feel of the premises. It's not a big budget production and that clearly shows on some occasions, but that does in no way spoil the fun. And it is a lot of fun. There are a lot of classic tropes playing out without big surprises, but they always feel a bit off, underlined by the fantastic score, putting things into somewhat uncharted territory. The only thing that didn't sit right in the plot *SPOILERS AHEAD* was the big gunfight. Those soldiers were supposed to be elite troops, but didn't feel that way at all, more like goofs with guns. *SPOILERS END*An overall fun, gleeful fun for most parts, with some surprises and an overall very nice style.",The Guest

The only ''bright'' thing in this mess is the outstanding performance of Dan Stevens, who truthfully represents a state of mind of a psychopath David. However,the idea behind the story remains unclear and probably no one besides the director himself knows what he wanted to say.David is a psychopath, he was a part of the experiment, he is programmed to protect?! the Peterson family, but suddenly he is reprogrammed so he now wants to kill them. What the f***? I mean, is this some joke? 99 minutes of pure desperation. I'm honestly so angry when I see a 6.7 star rating on this page. This is not a horror movie(should I be scared because of a dreadful Halloween labyrinth(*sarcasm*)in the school gym?) nor a mystery movie( the only mystery is how someone considers it a good movie), nor a thriller.

I watched the trailer and assumed it will be some average movie but I was totally mistaken. The film is very fast paced with surprisingly some humor throughout. There was a lot of gruesome fight scenes (I personally jump watching violent scenes) but I get the reasons why they were there. Dan Stevens was a complete shocker with his performance. If you remember him from Downtown Abbey, his performance here is amazing! He portrays a brilliant character and he does an amazing American accent. All the actors were perfectly cast for this movie. I loved Maika Monroe, she reminded me a lot of Brittany Murphy and Gwen Stefani. The ending was totally not expected and I loved every bit.

Direction: not exceptional but solid. Music: it was OK, although the 80's music at the end was a bit too loud and made it difficult to understand the characters. Overall it was a solid thriller.I also liked seeing the cop boss from The Wire. I actually started watching it from the 2/3 of the length of the movie (where the action starts), then went back to the beginning.

I've never seen this actor before but he has suddenly become a favorite of mine... I will definitely watch more of his future roles.... Cant wait to watch Night at The Museum now....Hopefully he's one of the main characters throughout the movie..From what I can tell, it looks like he is going to be...

391,ab-163-786207,Very disappointing,3,18 November 2014,"great main character and that's about it. It all looks like a self made movie with not much content. All in all, wast of time. Not sure why this is above a 5 rating.There was nothing special about this movie. Low budgeted, very normal acting and some seriously bad editing. Anyways, saw 7.5 rating and i was like wow, this is a movie i never saw in the trailers, must see it. So started, 15 minutes i could guess the story line. However, all the time i was wondering why the 7.5 was given to it. The movie is not more then a 4 in any respect. Like if this is the only movie you have to see and nothing nothing else, then go for it.",The Guest
392,goosse-164-884773,A REALLY BAD movie.,1,19 November 2014,"Like many, I viewed this horrible piece of SHYAT to the end. I think people here lure other critics to thinking it's a great movie to pass along the wasted time they endured. The plot is so predictable, my nephew who suffers from a mental disability would have figured out how this movie would end. It seemed like I was trapped in a cheap, corny rehash of B-movie clichés from the 1980s and you can't wait for it to slink away into a corner and disappear. I also suspect the entire cast of this D- movie is voting behind a proxy server and hitting 10 stars like its their job.

393,samsonrichard8,PLEDGE this movie is,5,8 December 2014,"it's beautifully shot, with beautiful people in it, playing with beautiful things.very much so like a commercial, without the laughs, the dubbed voices, and the well assumed stupidity. this movie really tries, but it is so empty, there is no substance what so ever. OK the background, the actors, the dialogs, are really nice but there is: A) no purpose, B) no set up, C) no resolution or story end. it doesn't even end. yeah i mean the screen goes black, it is written ""the end"" but there is none. a horror movie is about showing people in desperate dramatic situations trying to survive whatever tries to kill them but the purpose is to scare the audience, you don't care if the story is rubbish, or the killer unbelievable. Did you had your scare? yes so the rest doesn't really matters right? in this case it is the same thing except it is not an horror movie even not remotely. So the movie is really good at two things, one; drag you in to it. two; making you believe there is gonna be some sort of resolution or answer...it is like they had a super good idea, with a nice set up and so on, but they left to celebrate and left the finishing to there secretary or asked an unwilling waitress to find an end for them while trying to get her number.",The Guest
394,leonwillmakeit,So America DOES still know how to make GOOD films!!!,9,18 December 2014,"First of all I had to register and write this review out of ANGER!! Anger for all the IDIOTS who wrote a bad review for this movie...To TRUE film lovers this movie is an excellent piece of work. At first I thought it would be a low budget Bulls**t film but how I was wrong! I'm not going to go into any details about what it's about as you can read the synopsis on IMDb. All I can say is I was supposed to go to sleep in 10 minutes but instead I'm now going to sleep 2 hours later with such excitement.This movie had all the elements of an 80s cult classic... where actors knew how to act... yes can you believe it? ... ACT!! The soundtrack was amazing (which I had to YouTube after) the shots were great, the acting wasn't over-acted, the character development was on point... the script as well as the actors themselves all put to shame the current big budget garbage that is being forced down our throats in today's cinema. This film brought me back to movies like 'assault on precinct 13' (the original) remember the ice cream van scene with the little girl? Anyways, to sum things up we NEED more films like this to restore our faith in modern cinema, and I'm just so happy this film has proved we don't need names like Shia Lebouf, Brad Pitt and Tom Cruise (yawn x3) to make a good film. Let the underdogs have a turn! Cannes eat your heart out and anyone that wrote a bad review for this eat a cactus... slowly.Conclusion: I can't believe this film exists in 2014... WOW.",The Guest

397,Transcendentals,'80s nostalgia with modern visuals,8,24 December 2014,"It feels almost inaccurate to refer to this movie as The Guest when in reality it was entirely carried by a wonderful performance by Dan Stevens. I enjoyed it thoroughly, which isn't at all to say it's what I would normally call a good movie. The movie is highly campy, reminiscent of '80s-'90s action movies / thrillers, and Dan Stevens brings in an excellent all around tongue in cheek tough 80's anti-hero performance. Stevens' acting is well matched by strong action that is to the point and not drawn out, as well as superbly chosen music, particularly in the climactic scenes. For any gamers out there, if you enjoyed Far Cry 3: Blood Dragon for the nostalgia and humor, you'll likely love this movie as much as I did.",The Guest

A promising storyline, pretty well acted, that ends in a typical American, can't think of a decent end, so let's kill everyone film.A pretty believable plot for the most part where a solder back from war arrives at the house of his dead friend from the war's family. He appears to want to help them in their lives, but you're never quite sure if he's hiding something. Like I say a good plot, with an extremely poor gung ho ending.Don't build your hopes up.",The Guest

400,tonyblairblowsgoats,The worst film I have seen in years,2,5 January 2015,"I totally agree with the reviews on here stating how staggered they are by the critics high scores for this film. Along with some others I have never watched Downton Abbey and I can only imagine that the reviewers and critics have spent far too long luvvying over Dan Stevens and less time considering how poor this film is from an qualified perspective. From the very beginning the acting is sterile and wooden, the characters are unimaginative small-town clichés and the plot is as thick as the atmosphere in space. Rarely have I paid for a movie and regretted it so much. Ordinarily I would expect to have a few clues as to what is going to happen, such that I might be intrigued by the cookie crumbs that could possibly lead me to the relative safety of a desirable conclusion but there are none, none at all, the cinematic vultures swooped down and ate them all when the script was being thrown together, no doubt following a misinterpreted epiphany that this flick should be fabricated.",The Guest
401,evilgummidge,A poorly executed 80's throwback,1,6 January 2015,"Just gonna sum this up in a nutshell. This David guy shows up at the door of a bereaved family and claims to be an old war buddy of their dead son. So naturally he instantly becomes a part of the family, granted complete access to all aspects of the homestead. Like, instantly. No questions. Really? And of course he is not what he seems. But who is he? Well, i couldn't possibly say because no real explanation is offered save for the fact he is proper handy in a bar fight and wanted by what is possibly the most inept military unit in the history of movie-land. Seriously, six highly trained elite marksman can't take down one guy with a laundry basket. From 3 metres. In broad daylight. Oh, and of course he is invincible. Why? Because shut up, that's why! Throw all this madness together with some terrible acting, shaky dialogue, cavernous plot holes and a soundtrack straight from a 1983 teen slasher flick and you have what is possibly the most pointless hour and a half ever committed to celluloid.",The Guest
402,natashaangela,"Good, but not best",5,8 January 2015,"The movie is pretty good as it has a nice guideline. Stevens play his role so good, I can say that his grin suits the intention of ""David"". But despite of the good characters, I can only give 5 out of 10 since it was pretty clear from the start who is the bad. It would be much better if it was closed with amazing ending while what I saw 3 minutes ago was so so and predictable. And the explanation about ""David"" is not really interesting. I was hoping that he had more unpredictable background. There are many mystery thriller movies like this out there, so they should have made another one. Too many complains but it can be forgiven for I quite enjoyed the movie.",The Guest

There is a somewhat confusing connection between 'mysterious stranger/guest' and CIA-type operational center, that by all weak editing suggestions, may as well be connected to the town through a series of underground tunnels.Before the movie's end ( which feels like it should have been 25 minutes earlier), many highly trained and well-armed special agents are dispatched with, in all manners effortless and implausible .

But, I also do not agree with what he said...that ""In the beginning it was tolerable to watch"" I really find so silly that how can a family allows a total stranger to even let him stay for more then 30 minutes...not questions how he know their son as when their son has not mentioned his name to their parents. The rest became so predictable it was annoying.

Although, I am a sucker for military movies action involved with a good looking man/men. Lol What girl isn't? There were some parts that could have been better, but that also comes with any movie.

It's a breath of fresh air for those who love this genre of film so sit back, relax, and escape from the real world for a bit.If 'The Guest' had drawn up a better conclusion this would've been a great flick, even if it was a 'Drive' spin off. Not that the ending of The Guest movie was cheesy, it just didn't do justice to the intoxicating 1st hour. At least there's not a 30 minute bionic man super-hero street fight and nobody is trying to save the earth from zombies or the alien apocalypse.p.s. Would rate it an 8.5/10.",The Guest

The idea that a movie like this got made, paid for, and released theatrically in 2014 is a miracle.I urge any fan of genre schlock to watch this film and accept it for what it is. Soak in the synth soundtrack, the saturated visuals, and the hammy performances. Watch star Dan Stevens devour any scene with his robotically smug grin and foreboding grimace. Revel in the snap zooms and appreciate the idea that fun, creative, indulgent movies can still be made, seen, and appreciated under the radar in the modern age.",The Guest

(CIA Boss),5,11 July 2015,"I seriously only set-up my reviewer profile to post this review because I felt so strongly how about bad the CIA boss was, which no one else appears to have discussed (Lance Reddick).He's a CIA leader and of both the guns he held (MP5 & a handgun) he held and used them both like a first-time user! Seriously, could they have not taught him how to hold a gun!?AT ONE POINT HE HELD ON THE SIDE LIKE HE WAS IN BOYZ IN THE HOOD!!!! CUZ THAT'S CIA STANDARD PROCEDURE! It honestly angered me that much. He also walked around hip-aiming a pistol. Seriously.But yeah the actual film was alright at the start, had me desperate to find out what the main character had really done, he was so cool too. Second half of the film it went a bit silly, especially the school carnival style cat and mouse thing, really got boring.I'd give it a 6 but honestly Major Carver's performance was ridiculously awful in every single way. I'm still in dis-belief that no one in production, editing or anyone with a slight bit of common sense stopped it and sorted that out. Seriously awful.",The Guest

And what school would shell out that much for a haunted maze for Halloween? Its a fire hazard! Where are the G D fire sprinklers?

415,davejug,Quite a good movie but too many plot holes,7,23 August 2015,"The concept of this movie is engaging and the direction and acting is really good, but there are a few plot holes that should really have been ironed out first.David, the main character, is a likable character, clever at using psychology to connect in a different way with each of the family members. The two children are well acted too, even if their parts seem a little too scripted in parts.Spoiler alert - There are two major flaws with this movie. Firstly, David was made aware that Anna had called the authorities about him. If this were real, he'd know they would be right after him and he would leave immediately, which, of course, he did not. Secondly, the authorities were getting all the special forces guys within 100km of them to get this guy, two cars turned up with 5-6 guys in them, hardly a show of force. /Spoiler alertAll in all the movie was fairly entertaining and well acted, the music is great and the plot is engaging, but it will leave you unfulfilled.",The Guest
416,kevinirwin-24630,The ending is just... so bad.,3,23 November 2015,"I was legitimately entertained for the first 3/4 of this movie. After the shootout with the MPs and killing the parents everything goes to hell. David loses all tactical sense he was operating with and becomes a typical bad horror movie/Bond villain. He leaves the loaded gun on the ground next to the Major, whom he just assumes is dead (doesn't even check). Why would he leave a perfectly good, loaded pistol behind? It's blatantly obvious that he's going to be killed with the knife he gives the son. Then, after being shot in the shoulder by the young Gwen Stefani and disappearing into the fog, he stabs her in the leg with a knife. Then, presumably forgetting the knife he just stabbed her in the leg with, he proceeds to choke her to death AS IF HE DOESN'T HAVE A KNIFE TO SLIT HER THROAT WITH! And then he's stabbed in the shoulder by the son with the knife he had given him earlier (predictable), and stabbed again in his diaphragm (which is a killing blow, would suffocate). But, he's fine and just has a limp at the end. I thought the movie was promising up until the end. The ending filled me with a white hot rage that made me want the last two hours of my life back. 3/10 only because of the young Gwen Stefani. I wouldn't mind seeing her in a film with a better story. She's twice the actor of anyone else in the movie and, hey, is pretty sexy with those high socks and whatnot. This movies gets 3 stars from me purely stemming from the power of boners.",The Guest

I realize this movie does has flaws, the script for the story was rushed and I wish it wasn't because the David's backstory is s**t. Even with that MY GOD Dan motherf**king Stevens, you brought a tears of joy to my eyes, you beautiful man. In all seriousness Dan's acting is amazing in this movie. Dan plays an ex-military visiting his deceased friends family to talk and help them in their sons absence. Dan is mysterious, edgy, cold and has a strong presence in the movie. This is what makes Dan so good. rest of the cast are meh, good just not up there with Dan and Lance Reddick was poor. The action in this movie is very good for its budget, well thought out and not Michael Bayish.

Then how about the killing? kill the mother with a knife just like that with no drama ? whats is this? a slaughterhouse? how about the shooting scene, really? showing the police so inept and stupid. The African American policeman acting was if he was picked from the street and was told, here is the uniform, go act. I just fast forwarded after 20 minutes. Such a waste of time.
