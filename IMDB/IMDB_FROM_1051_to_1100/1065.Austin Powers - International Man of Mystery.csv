0,TheLittleSongbird,"Shagadelic, baby!",9,4 May 2010,"Words cannot describe how wonderful this film was. The story is admittedly daft, but the film itself is witty, sophisticated and hysterically stupid, while being fast, furious and fun as well. The humour is hilarious to the point of sides splitting, from the mocking of the fashion and musical style of the Swinging Sixties period, to countless references to 007, Matt Helm and Our Man Flint. And Austin's catchphrases?... groovy! The film looks amazing, with bright colourful sets and great costumes, and the soundtrack is funky. Then we have Mike Myers brilliant as Austin Powers(better than he was in Cat in the Hat anyway, the less said about that travesty the better), and hysterically over-the-top as the arch-nemesis Dr Evil, and Elizabeth Hurley fabulously sexy as Vanessa Kensington. Overall, wonderful film, better than I thought it would be. Shagadelic, baby! 9/10 Bethany Cox",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
1,bkoganbing,"Yeah Baby,.Groovy",7,15 December 2009,"When he made Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery Mike Myers aspired to comic greatness, the kind we had not seen on the screen since Peter Sellers. Only Sellers and Alec Guinness could create so many believable characters in the same film and make them work the way Myers does with Austin Powers and his perennial nemesis Doctor Evil.Hard to believe, but back in the swinging London of the Sixties, the British kids really did dress like Austin Powers. The key to Powers character is that whether he's in the Sixties or the Nineties, he's still an overgrown kid.The film is like the old Batman TV series where the Gotham City Police Department is good enough at dealing with ordinary criminals. But when exotic types like the Joker or the Penguin threaten the law and order of Gotham City, Commissioner Gordon reaches for the Batphone and Adam West and Burt Ward start doing their thing in tights. Powers is on the verge of nabbing Doctor Evil back in the day when the doctor takes off in a rocketship and cryogenically freezes himself. It's also some rocketship if I do say so. Not to be outdone, British Intelligence cryogenically freezes Austin Powers because he's the only man capable of dealing with Evil in their service.Both men have to adapt to a culture shock. Doctor Evil has mixed feelings about the test tube baby son he fathered in Seth Green. As for Powers, he's not quite fathoming the fact that his Emma Peel like partner Mimi Rogers from back in the day has a daughter in Elizabeth Hurley doing her bit in the family spy business.Michael York as the M character and Powers boss and Robert Wagner as Number 2 in the Evil Empire both look like they're having a really good time hamming up their parts. There's also a nice unbilled part by Tom Arnold as a cowboy in the men's room with Powers when one of the Evil assassins tries to get him.A lot of good laughs in this first Austin Powers film, I do so hope Mike Myers does make still another one.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
2,Leofwine_draca,The spoofery's not bad...,5,16 September 2021,"My first exposure to Mike Myers at the cinema, no less. I thought this was okay, apart from Myers whose incessant mugging became wearisome after about two minutes. The rest, including Susannah Hoffs, Michael York and Liz Hurley, isn't too bad and I did appreciate the campness of the 1960s stylings and some of the music. But as for Myers himself - no thanks!",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
3,SnoopyStyle,Mike Myers's love of 007 comes through,8,28 September 2013,"Austin Powers (Mike Myers) is a hip 60's super agent who battled his nemesis Dr Evil (Mike Myers). When Dr Evil cryogenically froze himself and launched into orbit in a Bob's Big Boy, Austin followed suit and also froze himself. When Dr Evil returns in present day, they unfreeze Austin to battle his nemesis once again.This is a hilarious spoof of the 007 films. Mike Myers has created one the most memorable character of all times. He obviously loves those films because he spoofs all the right elements. Unlike other bad spoof movie, this is a good one because of Mike Myers' love. The jokes are still funny after multiple viewings.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
4,lee_eisenberg,Yes!!!!!!,10,24 March 2006,"When ""Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery"" came out, no one saw it coming (although in retrospect, we should have, given Mike Myers's characterizations of English people on ""Saturday Night Live""). The plot of course has hip Austin trying to stop dastardly Dr. Evil from taking over the world. But of course, the whole movie's an excuse to be crazy, making fun of the James Bond movies every step of the way. I don't know how they came up with some of that stuff (such as a certain Swedish-made product), but they did. All in all, it shows why the '60s were groovy, baby. And of course, the sequels got progressively sillier. Truly a modern classic.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
5,jboothmillard,Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery,8,10 March 2005,"This is one of the best spy spoofs ever made. Mike Myers stars as Austin Powers, a secret agent from the 1960s brought into 1997. He has been brought back to fight Dr. Evil (Myers again) who plans to take over the world. He uses Vanessa (Elizabeth Hurley) to help him. A very funny film with some good gags. Seth Green hardly does much, but he will later in the next two films. Austin Powers is stupid, but then again, so Dr. Evil. I can't decide who's funnier of the two. Austin's funniest moment is discovering the future, e.g. crossing off deceased people he admired, and testing at CDs and trainers. Dr. Evil's funniest moment is telling Scott (Green) to shh. Also starring Mimi Rogers as Mrs. Kensington, Robert Wagner as Number Two, Fabiana Udenio as Alotta Fagina (kinda like Pussy Galore) and Mindy Sterling as Frau Farbissina. Look out for Burt Bacharach, True Lies' Tom Arnold, Christian Slater, Star Wars' Carrie Fisher and Rob Lowe! Mike Myers was number 46 on The Comedians' Comedian, and the film was number 4 on The 50 Greatest Comedy Films. Very good!",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
6,ccthemovieman-1,Here's A Fast-Moving 90 Minutes,9,6 October 2006,"Austin Powers: Man of Mystery I'm embarrassed to admit this one-and-a-half hours of hedonistic humor was so enjoyable, but it was, and the two sequels weren't bad, either, but not as good as this one.This is stupid; this is corny; it has way too many sexual innuendos, particularly for the millions of teens who saw this film.....but it is undeniably funny. It's also extremely colorful and the '60s clothing is a hoot to see once again (yeah, I remember it well.) This is the like the TV-program ""Laugh-In,"" but with a dumb story.I have no complaints looking at Elizabeth Hurley (""Vanessa Kensington"") and Michael Myers (""Austin Powers""), with his crooked teeth, stupid grin and ridiculous sayings made me laugh. This is a very fast-moving film, a spoof of James Bond and a spoof of the crazy '60s. The 90 minutes go by quickly.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
7,Tweekums,A fun spy spoof,8,24 February 2017,"Back in the swinging sixties Austin Powers is the spy no woman can resist; he is also the arch-nemesis of the fiendish Doctor Evil. After Dr Evil's plot to kill Powers fails he has himself cryogenically frozen and launched into orbit. Knowing Evil will one day return Powers is also frozen until he is needed again. In the 90s Dr Evil returns so Powers is thawed out. They both discover that the world has changed significantly while they were away. Dr Evil's organisation is now a major legitimate corporation but he is still determined to hold the world to ransom. Powers has to discover that the era of free love has long gone and he is no longer God's gift to women. As Dr Evil sets his dastardly plans into motion Austen and his assistant Vanessa Kensington work to stop him.Sometimes spoof films are just embarrassing but thankfully this is lots of fun. It plays with the tropes of the genre in a delightful way. We have Dr Evil planning elaborate easy to escape methods for killing Powers while his son recommends just shooting him in the head and making a demand for what he thinks is a significant amount of money but which is trivial by the '90s. There are plenty of laughs to be had as the spy genre, and James Bond in particular, are delightfully spoofed. Some of the gags are a little but crude, but not overly so, and others are more clever; most notably when after two henchmen are killed we are shown how they are real people with family and friends rather than nobodies to be dispatched with a witty aside. Mike Myers impresses in the dual roles of Austin Powers and Dr Evil, Elizabeth Hurley is suitably sexy as Vanessa and Robert Wagner is fun as he plays Number Two in a relatively straight way. Seth Green is also good as Dr Evil's son. There are plenty of well-known faces, including Carrie Fisher, Christian Slater and Rob Lowe, in cameo roles. Overall I'd recommend this to anybody wanting a bit of a laugh; especially if you are a fan of the spy genre.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
8,BA_Harrison,Shagadelic!,8,16 December 2016,"Way back when Mike Myers didn't rely on a certain green ogre for a salary, he starred in three hugely successful Austin Powers movies, affectionate spoofs of the '60s spy genre, the first of which saw the titular 'International Man of Mystery' (Myers) and his nemesis Dr. Evil (also played by Myers) being thawed out in 1997 after thirty years in cryonic suspension. Continuing where they left off in 1967, Dr. Evil plots to hold the world to ransom, while Powers teams up with a sexy new sidekick, Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley), to try and defeat him.Written by Myers, and directed by Jay Roach, Austin Powers delivers a barrage of visual buffoonery, bawdy innuendo, toilet humour, and general lunacy, most of which hits the mark, with lots of cool cameos from the likes of Christian Slater, Carrie Fisher, Will Ferrell, Tom Arnold, and Rob Lowe, to name just a few. Even if madcap humour isn't your thing, it would take a joyless soul not to laugh at at least some of the craziness on display (I defy anyone to keep a straight face during the scene that takes place in a toilet stall!). Myers' groovy schtick would become even funnier in subsequent sequels; it's no wonder that he is currently planning to revive his flagging career with a fourth film in the series.7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for Hurley in that silver quasi-futuristic mini-dress.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
9,moonspinner55,"If it winked any harder it would have eye strain, but the laughs are certainly there...",7,2 May 2008,"The first film in what became a surprisingly successful trilogy for actor-writer-comedian Mike Myers, here concocting a knowing and often hilarious send-up of spy-and-sex spoofs from the Swinging '60s. Austin Powers, a super-cool ladies' man in 1960s London, has been frozen in a cryogenics lab, but is eventually thawed out in 1997 just in time to battle the nefarious Dr. Evil. Mike Myers' creation of fish-out-water Powers (as well as Dr. Evil, a Bondian villain, whom he also plays) is a deft, original human cartoon, invested with shameless, lascivious glee. Powers is not without a heart (and feelings), rare qualities in a mad-slapstick satire, though Myers is hardly a sentimentalist and, for the most part, the gags are aimed at the rafters. The world-takeover plot is just a sketch, and Dr. Evil does become gratuitous, but Myers is having so much fun that it's nearly impossible not to join him. The childish bad taste (on a locker room level) becomes a running joke, and the sniggering naughtiness is infectious (one laughs helplessly, as with some of Mel Brooks' better films). Followed next by 1999's ""Austin Powers The Spy Who Shagged Me"". *** from ****",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
10,Quinoa1984,One of the funniest films ever made,9,28 February 2000,"Austin Powers is a masterpiece of parody comedy.  And it proves that when given the chance, Mike Myers can be a true comic genius.  He has created a silly story (funny for both kids and adults) which contains to equally hilarious characters (both played by Myers) about a shagadelic secret agent named Austin Powers who has to stop the world from nuclear war (one of the things Austin is scarred of other than carnies) from the diabolical Dr. Evil, who happens to be the best villain in decades.  Along the way, we see the merry mix-ups that occur for Austin as he finds himself in a new time (he was frozen for 30 years from 1967-1997) and for Dr. Evil and as he tries to control his quasi-evil son.  Along with great characters, a great script and all elements in place, this film is one of the best of 97 and of humor. Very Shagadelic.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

13,Theo Robertson,I Preferred The Sequel,5,19 January 2005,"I really enjoyed THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME . It was the first film in the series I saw which may possibly explain why I enjoyed the original a lot less . THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME cuts to the chase very quickly while AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY is held by the very obvious and necessary need to explain who the eponymous hero is . Of course it's silly to criticise the other aspects like "" Oh there's no Fat Bastard in this movie etc "" because it's my own fault for watching the franchise in the wrong order I can't help thinking however that the jokes are somewhat weaker here . I watched the movie on Sunday night and I'm having some difficulty in trying to remember the gags . There's two that stick out in my mind , one is the scene with Dr Evil's cat which will upset cat lovers everywhere ( I laughed out loud at this scene ) and the other is a visual gag that stands out in its unoriginality of a man walking about naked thatI first saw done in THE BENNY HILL SHOW thirty years ago and has been done to death since then Not a bad effort from Mike Myers but my gut instinct is that THE SPY WHO SHAGGED ME is the funniest movie in the series",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

15,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Finally, a good Bond spoof",8,8 March 2004,"This is really a funny parody of the Bond movies. This is the best thing to watch if you've seen a typical by-the-numbers Bond movie, one of the old ones, for example, and thought it was ridiculous, or at the very least something other than great. The plot is directly spoofing the old Bond movies, with an evil villain trying to take over the world. The acting is pretty good, for a spoof movie; the characters are mostly caricatures and stereotypes, to further parody the Bond movies, but they add to the humor of the film. Mike Myers is great in this movie, pretty much anyone who likes him will probably enjoy him in this. I loved how it was spoofing the Bond movies, sometimes even mentioning the ludicrousness of the characters actions in details. If you're into 60's stereotypes, crude sexual humor and some great Bond-spoof action, you'll most likely enjoy this. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys spoof movies, and who's seen at least one Bond movie and thought it was a bit ridiculous. It's filled to the brink with crude sexual innuendo and Bond-spoofing. 8/10",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
16,view_and_review,I'll Take More Dr. Evil,6,14 December 2020,"""Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery"" begins in 1967, a groovy, hip, swinging era. Dr. Evil escaped from Austin Powers (both played by Mike Myers) to be cryogenically frozen until 1997. Austin Powers, ever in pursuit of Dr. Evil, was also frozen. They both woke up in 1997 doing the same ol' same ol': Dr. Evil looking to destroy the world and Austin Powers trying to stop him.Dr. Evil was the funniest character to me. His mannerisms and mode of speech was a gas. Austin Powers should've been a supporting character. He was a throwback as were the female characters around him. He was a swinging womanizer and all the women wanted him. Even his 90's partner, Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley), with all of her protestations, fell right into the sex object role. She wore any number of revealing outfits and no matter how crude Austin Powers was she couldn't help but be charmed by him.For my money I would prefer more Dr. Evil, his son Scott Evil (Seth Green), and the rest of his crew.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
17,evanston_dad,Oh Behave!,7,30 June 2010,"Mike Myers plays both Austin Powers, as groovy as secret agents get, and Dr. Evil, Powers' arch enemy, in this comedy franchise that spoofs everyone's favorite secret agent, James Bond.Though all three entries in the series are hit and miss funny, the hits mostly outnumber the misses, and if you think Mike Myers is funny, you'll probably think the films are funny, because they're basically just venues for Myers' trademarked brand of schtick. Though the plots differ nominally, the three separate parts of the trilogy are essentially the same movie with the same jokes just put in different order. But they're good jokes, and it's just as funny watching Myers and company deliver the same punch line for the third time as it was the first.Grade: B for the whole series",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
18,Uriah43,Life 30 Years After the Turbulent 60's,5,14 September 2016,"After an evil genius by the name of ""Dr. Evil"" (Mike Myers) has himself cryogenically frozen in order to return when the world least expects it, the secret agent known as ""Austin Powers"" (also played by Mike Myers) allows himself to undergo the same process to thwart any future attempts of world domination. What neither of them count on is the manner in which the world has changed and their ability to adapt poses a serious problem for both of them. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this movie provided an amusing contrast between life in the 60's and life in Western society 30 years later. No doubt those familiar with the 60's will appreciate much of the humor in this parody of several James Bond films. Likewise, the presence of both Elizabeth Hurley (as ""Vanessa Kensington"") and Fabiana Udenio (""Alotta Fagina"") certainly didn't hurt the scenery in any way either. Unfortunately, I thought some of the comedy was unnecessarily crude which, in my opinion, negated the film's overall entertainment value to a certain degree and for that reason I have rated it accordingly. Average.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
19,anaconda-40658,International Myers of Mystery.,7,9 June 2015,"Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997): Dir: Jay Roach / Cast: Mike Myers, Elizabeth Hurley, Robert Wagner, Seth Green, Mimi Rogers: They call him the international man of mystery perhaps for his ability to spellbind his female admirers. Satire of James Bond films beginning in 1967 where Austin Powers foils a world domination scheme by Dr. Evil who freezes himself and launches into space. Thirty years later Powers is thawed and given the task of stopping Dr. Evil again. Slapstick violence highlights the climax with use of a penis enlarger to tag on the double ending. Director Jay Roach exploits the Bond clichés with Dr. Evil making for a hilarious villain. Mike Myers embodies both Powers and Evil with great comic timing. Elizabeth Hurley plays an agent trying to maintain focus. Unfortunately the role is cardboard standard issue and never rises above being a simple sex tease. Her only real function is to be hit on by Powers. Robert Wagner steals scenes as agent Number Two in a role that also seems standard until he has a breakdown moment. Seth Green is terrific as Dr. Evil's son Scott who resents his dad and desires to be an animal vet. Mimi Rogers plays Austin's partner in the 1960's and Hurley turns out to be the product of their partnership. Highlighted with frozen images of celebrities past their prime resulting in a colourful laugh riot. Score: 7 ½ / 10",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
20,FlashCallahan,Here's your orange sherrrrrberrrrt.....,6,29 June 2013,"1960's British hipster secret agent Austin Powers is brought out of cryofreeze to oppose his arch-enemy Dr. Evil into the 1990s. Austin is then released, and thawed back into action to once again battle Dr. Evil where he wakes up somewhere in Nevada and steals a nuclear weapon to hold the world to ransom. After Austin is woken up to stop Dr. Evil he gets a new sidekick Vanessa Kensington, his ex-partner's daughter.They go to Vegas to stop Dr. Evil's plot to control the world for 100 billion dollars.....It's clear that Myers has a love for England and the sixties, as this has so much intense referencing and in jokes, it commands you to watch it several times just to get all the jokes, and this is why it works so well.The plot is second fiddle to characters, its a perfunctory maguffin that showed up in most spy films of the sixties, Myers concentrates on the characters most of all, and they are fantastic.The titular character is a little tired thought to watch now, but its nothing to do with the film, its just pop culture has wrung the comedy out of Powers so much, you do cringe whenever he says one of his catchphrases.Dr Evil though is still timeless, because he is just so straight faced and the clumsiest character you'd ever likely to meet.It's pretty left field stuff, from surprising cameos, to in my opinion the funniest thing of the film, showing the personal life of a henchmen, brilliant and totally unexpected.Watch this and then watch Danger! Diabolik, the film it homages the most.Good stuff, but referenced within an inch of its life, which tarnishes it a little.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
21,movieman_kev,A good flick undone by too many retreads,7,27 October 2005,"Mike Myers stars as Austin Powers & Dr. Evil for the first time in what would become a series of three films (thus far) that would get progressively more and more mentally vapid as time went on. If you've seen either of the other two films, first my condolences, but you won't miss anything by not seeing this one as the jokes are reused in all 3 films. If you only saw this first, that's a good thing for you as it saves you wasted time being as you won't have to sit through the other two travesties.

22,Aaron1375,Funny first entry that spoofs Bond movies.,8,17 July 2007,"Granted there was a movie with Leslie Nielson called ""Spy Hard"" that sort of made fun of Bond movies, but not really. In the end it spoofed to much stuff and the only part clearly making fun of a Bond movie was the title song. This movie, the first in the set of three was a very good spoof of James Bond, though it was probably a bit better in making fun of his villains because for me the funniest thing about the movie was Dr. Evil. Austin Powers himself was somewhat funny for most of the flick with flashes of being really funny. However, I was dying laughing when Dr. Evil torched one of his men, but said man didn't die. I also like the overly complicated trap when he could have shot Austin and been done with it. The story, Dr. Evil makes a narrow escape at the beginning, freezing himself so he can wreck havoc again in the future. Austin Powers does the same so he can once again stop his foe. Of course, there are jokes involving Austin's long layoff and returning to a new decade and his adjustment to the times. There are also father son issues involving Dr. Evil and his clone son. Though there are times this movie just kind of drifts off for me and the jokes don't hit on all cylinders, but for the most part it is a very funny movie.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
23,Wuchakk,The beginning of the zany trilogy,5,27 April 2015,"Mike Meyer's three Austin Powers flicks parody James Bond and the swinging 60s-70s. They are as follows: ""Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery"" (1997), ""Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me"" (1999) and ""Austin Powers in Goldmember"" (2002). What's interesting about these films is that Austin Powers (the character) is not a full spoof of 007 as he's his own character, just with Bond-like qualities.Anyway, I wasn't sure I wanted to review any these flicks because, by doing so, I'm admitting that I actually watched them (lol)! I say this because they're so goofy, juvenile, silly, sometimes raunchy (more verbally than pictorially) and filled with toilet humor. So I was never a fan and didn't even watch any of them until 2009. What turned me off? Besides the toilet humor and raunch, Powers (the character) seemed to have a gayish quality despite being a renowned ladies man in the stories. A good example is when he says, ""Oh, beHAAAve,"" which never struck me as funny, just gay.I've since seen all three twice and, despite my reservations about Powers and distaste for toilet humor, I do enjoy the zaniness and stoo-pid humor. If you can catch a grip with these films they're laugh-out-loud funny about a third of the time, sometimes more depending on the movie.The first one is my least favorite simply because it's the least funny IMHO. It seems like Meyers and his team were experimenting and feeling out the possibilities. With its box office success, the two sequels brim with more confidence and creativity and are just plain funnier IMHO.Best quote: ""Riiiiiiigggghhhttt.""The film runs 94 minutes and was shot in Southern California and Nevada.

He plays multiple roles as the sex-crazed hairy gap-toothed Austin Powers who was frozen in time in the 1960s while Dr. Evil, his complete opposite and enemy also was frozen in time. Now they're both back and at each other's throats again. Austin is trying to save the world while Dr. Evil is bald and truly evil. My favorite scenes include Dr. Evil and his minions including the wonderful Mindy Sterling and Robert Wagner. I love Dr. Evil's relationship with his newfound son, Scott Evil, played by Seth Green. Those are my favorite scenes in the film as Dr. Evil tries to get a hug from his son.

25,Mr-Fusion,One of the greatest spoofs of the last twenty years,8,20 December 2014,"Let me just say right here that Dr. Evil in the first AUSTIN POWERS is Mike Myers' greatest comedic contribution. His tics, his line delivery, his scenes with Seth Green; genuinely hilarious stuff. And on the whole, the first movie still stands head and shoulders above the others - if for no other reason than it doesn't topple over into overkill. Everything here is just right: the spoof of all the iconic OO7 elements (Dr. No, Blofeld's cat, Oddjob, Pussy Galore), Powers' goofy charm, even the odd DEMOLITION MAN gag thrown in. The idea of bringing the misogynistic '60s face-to-face with the PC '90s is brilliant, and makes for several great jokes. It tickles me that they got Robert Wagner and Michael York to do this movie. They even manage to wring some laugh out of Tom Arnold (no mean feat).Easily Myers' best movie.8/10",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

From ""Yeah, baby!"" to ""Riiiiiight"", Mike Myers is a genius when it comes to comedy! I think everyone could say that they laughed at least once to this film.Paroding of the James Bond flicks, Austin Powers is an international spy who is a lady's man. Dr. Evil, is Arch Nemesis, goes into the future of 1997 and now Austin must travel through time to find him. When he gets to 1997, he has a beautiful assistant, Vanessa, who happens to be the daughter of his former flame in the 60's. Vanessa resists Austin's charm and wants to stick to business while Austin is wasting no time to get to his ""business"" with her. Dr. Evil learns that he has a son, Scott played by Seth Green. When Scott isn't as excited to have Dr. Evil as a father, Dr. Evil tries anything he can to get Scott to love him, including a hilarious scene in a counseling group for father's and son's. But back into action, Austin must find Dr. Evil before he rules the world with his kitty, Mr. Bigglesworth. But can he do that and have Vanessa at the same time? You'll just have to see! My favorite characters that worked so well together was without a doubt Seth and Mike as Dr. Evil and Scott. They are just beyond hilarious and work so well together. I think a lot of the other Austin Powers fans would agree. There first scene together meeting is just really funny, ""Give Daddy a hug! I'm down with the kids, ducka ducka ducka!"" ""No! Get away from me you psycho!"". Classic! Like I said ""Austin Powers"" is just a great and funny movie that I think you can get into if you're looking for a decent comedy. Come on!

Spy spoofs usually amount to zip. That's why the raunchy `Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery' was so popular upon its release. It accomplished its mission of successfully spoofing the James Bond phenomenon in almost every way. The two sequels didn't do quite as well, but I was quite pleased with the second film, especially.`Saturday Night Live' veteran Mike Myers plays Austin Powers, a groovy British spy in the swingin' sixties. 1967, to be exact. His looks resemble the orangutan-meets-human look that British are stereotyped with, and his clothes are fresh outta' 60's London.Mike Myers also plays Dr. Evil, Powers' arch-nemesis. After tracing Dr. Evil to the Psychedelic Pussycat club in London, Evil gets away in a Big Boy rocket and blasts into outer space, where he circles the world for thirty years, frozen with his cat.Myers 1 - err, Austin Powers - is cryogenically frozen immediately, to be thawed out upon return of Dr. Evil.Well, the thirty years pass, and eventually Dr. Evil returns to earth, with Mr. Bigglesworth, his cat. Number 2 (Robert Wagner), his evil assistant, fills him in on what has happened over the years, and soon Evil is planning another `Highjack some nuclear warheads and hold the world ransom' bit.Austin is thawed out and sent to find and defeat Evil, along with the monkey-eared Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley).`Austin Powers' has its hit and misses, but comes off with mostly hits.

One of the most interesting aspects is that it does not spoof James Bond film as openly as one might expect- there are tiny, minute details that you only pick up on after multiple viewing. I really expected every other gag to be a satire on Bond films, but alas! They were not! Yes, the film is a spoof on Bond, but not to a sick extreme. Just minute things that audiences may - or may not - pick up on, depending on how knowledgeable they are on the Bond movies.Powers is, of course, a spoof on James Bond. He's sex-obsessed like Bond, but does not come across with the same coolness and ease of James Bond. At least not in the nineties, anyway.Dr. Evil is a spoof on Blofield, Bond's arch-nemesis from the Bond films. He is shrouded in mystery and when revealed boasts a bald head, a big, crooked nose, and a cat like Blofield's which is unfortunately naked - without fur - because it didn't thaw out so well in the Big Boy rocket.
Number 2 is a spoof on.well.Number 2 from `Thunderball' - from the name to the eye patch, which I only picked up on after viewing `Thunderball' recently.There are some very clever scenes in `Austin Powers.' Some of the gags spoof the spy genre very easily. Others fall flat, mainly because they try to get the audience to be sickened. Yes, the film needs to be raunchy to a certain degree - it is a Bond spoof - but they went a bit OTT on some of the jokes (the whole Jacuzzi scene got a bit prolonged.).Perhaps the greatest thing about this film is that it is not directly geared towards Bond geeks. We've seen satires that were targeted at a small audience range - like `Galaxy Quest.' I really disliked the film the first time I saw it because I do not watch `Star Trek' - but on second viewing I found it to be a clever satire on the Trekkies and equally so on the television show. I guess if I saw the film I would have enjoyed it more the first - and probably second - time. It was a good comedy, but if they had not geared it towards such a small range of audience, I feel they would have received more of a response to the film.But the exact opposite is the case with `Powers.' Bond geeks and regular moviegoers alike can enjoy this film. It brings two very different audiences together - they may laugh at different things, but they are still laughing together.Perhaps that is the film's biggest achievement. Sadly, it is its most overlooked, as well. I think that many people don't really understand WHY they like the film so much. I've heard people say, `Why do you like the film so much?' and the other person will say, `Well.umm.gee, I just do.' They themselves know the jokes are not always the greatest. Many of the gags DO fall short.But deep down they know that the cleverness of the film is what makes them like it so much - and they are either subconsciously afraid to admit that, or literally don't know how to.Be warned, `Powers' is not a film for everyone. If you don't like raunchy laughs, I wouldn't recommend it. But if you want to see a clever parody of the spy genre - well, I might as well say it: a clever parody of the James Bond genre (let's face it - there's no such thing as a spy genre anymore - James Bond has its own genre) - then I would recommend `Powers.' `Austin Powers.'4/5 stars -John Ulmer",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
28,OllieSuave-007,Not a very funny spoof.,3,12 February 2016,"Comedian Mike Myers stars as a 1960s hipster secret agent, who was cryonically frozen and released in the 1990's in order to battle his evil nemesis, Dr. Evil (Mike Myers). His goofy and flashy personality was out of place for the 1990s, but he seemed to hit it off with his partner-in-crime, Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley).The plot of Dr. Evil and his mad plan of holding the world hostage was, unfortunately, not emphasized enough in the film, which made the story less intriguing. Much of the movie was centered toward Austin Powers trying to woo Vanessa, which resulted in goofy but boring chemistry and an awkward attempt at romance.The movie was an obvious spoof to James Bond, but it wasn't tastefully done - there was no suspense. The ""hero"" of the film, Austin Powers, didn't really do anything in the movie except showing off his awfully hairy chest and cheap moves on Vanessa; at least the Naked Gun movies delivered laugh-out-loud humor and actually had solid good guy vs. bad guy plot devices and action. What you got here were just obvious sexual innuendos, crude jokes, and adolescent stuff.You will get some chuckles here and there on some of the slapstick puns, but the movie is mostly boring, juvenile and low-humored which as a result, in my opinion, makes it overrated.Grade D--",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
29,thesar-2,The Only Way to Watch the Old Bond Movies,9,1 December 2012,"""Groovy, Baby!"" At least that's what people said when Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery came out on video. I know I did.Unfortunately, I didn't catch the original Austin Powers when it hit theatres and caught wind of it on video, much like the audience did for The Terminator. Thank God for video (or DVD, or HD, or Bluray) or treasures like those two movies may never had expanded to sequels. And even, to date, there's only two sequels for Austin Powers, I simply can't wait for a part four.We're introduced to the swingin' Austin Powers in the 1960's as he battles his nemesis Dr. Evil. The bad doctor escapes, well, somewhat, in a freezing chamber (the legendary Bob's Big Boy mascot) and Austin follows suit. Both are defrosted in 1997 where Austin has to adjust, hilariously, to ""today's times"" while, again, battling the sinister Dr. Evil. Mostly in Las Vegas.I didn't grow up on the James Bond movies, and I admit it wasn't until a few years ago someone I was dating encouraged me to rent one of the original Sean Connery Bond films. Honestly, I don't recall which one (It might have been You Only Live Twice) but I seriously began laughing out loud at Blofeld, having seen Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery so many times before. Needless to say, this upset my partner as Blofeld and his pet were supposed to be taken seriously. I just never saw the movie Austin Powers spoofed before.And that's how good this comedy is. You don't even need to see the source material, though it helps. Airplane! is another that cracks me up every time I watch it, even though I never saw any of the Airport movies.This movie grabs you from the opening street dance segment, to the cultural references, to Austin's adjustment to the last part of the century and it doesn't stop there. He's pulling double-duty also playing the infamous Dr. Evil (or Blofeld) who's actually probably funnier. Enter in a wonderful Hurley, Sterling and Green (which looked very green he was so young here) and you have the perfect casting.Years after this release (1997) and I am still rolling every time I see Austin's over-the-top slapstick and sight-gags. See the steamroller accident. It's still great to quote this movie and it should be viewed by all that love intelligent spoof movies. Granted, there aren't a lot of them (Airplane!, Scary Movie, Naked Gun, Top Secret and this one are the only ones that come to mind,) but still I highly recommend this and I refuse to give away a lot of the joys in this review they show you throughout. Just watch it, and seriously, don't take it too seriously.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
30,bensonmum2,"""Yeah, baby, yeah""",9,29 March 2009,"I remember being terribly excited when Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery was first released. I couldn't wait to see it. And for one of the few times in my life, a movie not only lived-up to the hype, but actually exceeded my expectations. At the time, I considered it a real winner and would have most likely rated it a 9/10 (if I had been rating movies at the time).I re-watched Austin Powers: IMoM this weekend for the first time in something like 5 or 6 years. How would it hold up? This is the portion of most user comments where I write something about being disappointed by an old favorite I haven't seen in years. Well, I'm happy to report that that's not the case here. The comedy in Austin Powers: IMoM works as well today as it did 12 years ago. The movie really is Mike Myers' baby from start to finish and he was never better or funnier. The writing is sensational. Myers' understanding and parody of James Bond, the 60s, and general pop culture is spot on. The notion of Dr. Evil's outdated plans for taking over the world through force in contrast with No. 2's ability to do even better and be more successful in the world of business is s small point, but very cleverly written. Myers is laugh out loud funny whether in the guise of Austin Powers or Dr. Evil. It's brilliant! And there are some truly inspired set-pieces that work flawlessly. The sea bass with lasers scenes, the Fembots, and Dr. Evil's therapy sessions are all plain old funny. For my money, comedy doesn't get much better than this.With so much of the film focusing on Myers, it's almost surprising that the often underutilized supporting cast are nonetheless excellent. Elizabeth Hurley, Mimi Rogers, and even Seth Green (who normally gets on my nerves) give fine performances. But it's Robert Wagner as No. 2 who actually upstages even Myers on occasion that I find the best. Wagner's No. 2 is a scream! Wagner is so dead-pan serious that its amazing. It's a very nice piece of acting.In the end, Austin Powers: IMoM is as fresh today as ever. I'm still more than comfortable with my initial assessment and have now ""officially"" rated it a 9/10. Good job by all involved!",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

That's a problem because the picture is little else other than a series of loosely connected, via weak plot and character, 'SNL-like' skits which don't do anything, really, in the way of narrative or, despite their best efforts, in the way of comedy, either. It's also not entirely clear what the picture is a pastiche of, as - despite several obviously 'bond-inspired', mostly surface elements - its characters and aesthetics are so heightened that they're essentially beyond any semblance of recognition, even if its general concept is a sort of satire of 007's general 'outdated' nature. These elements don't really comment on, or reflect, the genre in any satisfying way (other than in the absolute broadest of strokes, of course).

33,bowmanblue,The lighter side of Dr No,8,17 August 2014,"Looking back on it, it was amazing that no one thought of completely lampooning those old Sean Connery Bond films until 1997. They were pretty over-the-top, but I guess that's what we loved about them. And, I dare say that the writer/star of 'Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery,' - Mike Myers - loves them as much as the rest of us. For he gives us a most loving take on the unspoken absurdities that we deliberately chose to overlook in the Bond films. He plays both hero and villain here as a swinging spy, frozen in the sixties and defrosted in the - rather more politically correct - nineties to do battle with the (Blofeld-like) Dr Evil.Despite being an American production, it has a very British feel to it. Everything is made fun of, but you never feel like they're being particularly cruel - it's all quite 'loving mockery' (if you know what I mean). It's not just a string of naughty jokes, but it also does go a little deeper in highlighting the change in attitudes from the 'free love' of the sixties to the more reserved nineties.There's nothing here that's particularly clever, just a stream of innuendos which seem like they've been taken straight out of the original Carry On films. But, if you're in the mood for some general silliness (and have a healthy knowledge of the old Bond films), you should enjoy the crazy ride and find you're spouting the several Powers/Evil catchphrases for some time to come.http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

Austin Powers was very shagadelic. I found it funny that Powers also played Dr. Evil. I saw this movie because of all the jokes and my friends recommended it to me. The jokes were extremely funny even though they were crude and sexual. This has to be one of the funniest films of the 90's excluding American Pie and the sequel of this film.

35,lesleyharris30,"Jam Packed with Many Laughs and Outstanding Comedic Performances,",9,17 June 2015,"Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery is a brilliant movie with a very well written storyline and a fantastic comedic cast. It is certainly one of my favourite feel good comedies, it instantly makes me smile and puts me in a good mood every time I watch, it has many memorable quotes and strange, unrelatable, but very lovable characters. The only scenes that bother me in this movie is when they go way too far with a joke, such as the scene where Austin is urinating or the death of one of Dr. Evil's henchman, it dosen't suit the tone of humour that we see in the majority of the film and is more so annoying than funny. The performances are outstanding, they seemed very hard to do as they are very high energy and it seems as if the whole cast didn't deliver, the entire movie would stumble, but luckily they all did very well, Mike Myers is the highlight of the film of course, playing both the protagonist and the antagonist, he shines in both roles and it is very hard to believe that Austin Powers and Dr. Evil are the same person, they are simply iconic performances. Hilarious from start to finish with memorable quotes and lovable characters, I would recommend Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery to anyone looking for a good comedy.

36,CuriosityKilledShawn,Gut-wrenchingly Terrible,1,19 June 2001,"At 89 minutes long (including end credits) you cannot expect anything more than for us to be robbed in broad daylight. Mike Myers is no great writer that's for damn sure. Apart from Austin Powers, Wayne Campbell, Axe Murderer and 54 has he ever been in a good movie? No. Wayne's World is hardly a plot driven film. Neither are the Austin Powers movies. Or Axe Murderer. 54 is junk.
He should not be a star. Or a Megastar (which some people think he is). For example...in this film he and Liz Hurley are underground in the Nevada desert. She is wearing this silver two-piece costume. 2 minutes later she is back at the Riviera hotel in a leather costume and another 2 minutes later she's back underground in the Nevada desert (?!). And another, there is no definitive version of this movie (not that I actually care) and almost every version has numerous added/deleted scenes. Why? All this film is is an excuse to throw up some stupid humor and this is proof of it.But the worst part is how people STILL TO THIS DAY go ""yeah baby"" and all that nonsense. Ugh! It makes me so mad.

38,ironhorse_iv,"Yeah, Baby! Yeah! 'Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery' was indeed a smashing, groovy one million dollar experience. It was fun to watch.",7,4 March 2020,"Influenced by 1966 British television series 'Adam Adamant Lives!' & original created by Mike Myers for the faux 1960s rock band 'Ming Tea' that Myers started with musicians Matthew Sweet and Susanna Hoffs following his Saturday Night Live stint in the early 1990s. The character found its way into movie production in early 1995. Parodying the James Bond & Harry Palmer's films of the late 1960s & early 1970s; this 1997 comedy tells the story of a swinging era British spy named Austin Powers (Mike Myers) having to cryogenically freeze himself in order to fight his nemesis Dr. Evil (Also played by Myers) sometime in the future. Hilarity arises when both men return in the late 1990s to find out that times has change and with that, their old ways of life. Teaming with fellow secret agent, Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley), Austin must now find out what Dr. Evil's next nefarious plan, while getting use to modern society norms. Without spoiling the movie too much, this spy genre flick from director Jay Roach got some mojo! Surprisingly most of the jokes in this flick still hold up to me. However, some of the deep followers of political correctness culture might think overwise. They will find the motion picture highly offensive and dated. It doesn't help that a then unknown convicted felon who torture women star in this movie as henchman Random Task. Even a joke about blackmailing the Royal family about an affair could be seen today as bad taste due to Princess Diana death later that year. Regardless, of all the controversial, this flick concept was much better than the film's two sequels 1999 'Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me' and 2002 'Austin Powers in Goldmember' where the movie's highly clichés annoying overused sexual crude and gross out toilet dialogue and visuals humor are much worst. At least, this movie's jokes aren't much of a turn off like the homing device scene or the Jerry Springer sequence in the sequel. I can't stand those. As for this movie, there are plenty of memorable moments, I truly love. My favorite happens to be Dr. Evil's therapist speech. Myers's acting as Dr. Evil is top notch with Myers as Austin being secondary alright and decent. I don't care if he stole the impression from fellow SNL castmate Dana Carvey. Any moment with the antagonist was truly an entertaining watch even if most of them felt like an out of place sketch comedy skit rather than part of the overall movie. After all, the film does feel like one with the intercut with the random dancing sequences between scenes often showing female dancers in bikini's and psychedelic artwork over their bodies like the television show 'Rowan and Martin's Laugh-In' (1967-1973). It can seem a bit jarring; much like the opening musical movie which is a random direct reference to The Beatles 1964's flick 'A Hard Day's Night' that has nothing to do with the rest of the moment. Nevertheless, overall those scenes feature here fits better than some of the other random sequences that modern home release videos edited back in. While somewhat funny, the theatrical version moment with the steamroller and the unnamed guard played by Michael McDonald was just enough time with its overly long gag. The added sequence with his wife and son reacting to his death kinda overdone it. Don't get me wrong that deeply disturbing and dark moment was still funny, but it would work better if shown in the after credits. Thank goodness, most DVDs have that moment back as a deleted scene along with the other security guard sequence and the two lightboat endings. Since most of the film's best dialogue like Dr. Evil's trying to quiet Scott (Seth Green) was improvise, hopefully one day we can see all the alternated takes or bloopers. Nevertheless, just don't worth this movie on television. Many of the jokes are censored or cut on broadcast TV. Despite where you watch it, the movie did make some of then-unknown comedians into bigger stars. One such example is Will Ferrell. His bit as the very injury Mustafa was downright unforgettable. He would later reprise his role in the sequels. As for the rest of the supporting cast. Robert Wagner, Clint Howard, Michael York and Mindy Sterling has their moments to shine. Even Elizabeth Hurley and Fabiana Udenio found themselves with a lot more depth than most love interests get in these types of spy movies. However, I hate what they did to Hurley's character in the sequel. That was awful and doesn't make sense with what happen in this movie. Plus, it was weird to see Austin not care about what happen to her. As for the cameos. I found Carrie Fischer and Tom Arnold great in the small roles they were given. Then there is costume design. For a very low budget movie, it had some very impressive wardrobes. I'm deeply surprise that this comedy wasn't nomination in that department at the 70th Academy Awards. It had a chance of winning. As for the music. ""Soul Bossa Nova"" by Quincy Jones was given new life. Before this movie, I never knew that this song was from an old Canadian game show called 'Definition' from the 1970s. The rest of the soundtrack by composter George Clinton was just as groovy baby! Overall: A fourth film entitled 'For Your Thighs Only' was announced in 2005 but so far, nothing has come of it yet. It doesn't help that Myers had two cinematic failures since then. The death of Verne Troyer's in 2018 from an alcohol poisoning makes this even less likely. But maybe one day it will come. Until then, we always have this movie to laugh at. It's one flick worth watching for sure.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
39,The-Sarkologist,The original Austin Powers movie,6,7 October 2011,"When I saw the shorts to this movie my first thoughts were, ""this looks stupid."" and the more previews that I saw the more that I thought that it was stupid. Then my friends saw it and were telling me how good it was and quoting is constantly. I was slowly convinced that I might appreciate it. Then I said to my friends Gill and Nick Abbott that I wanted to see it and they said that it was horrid. Still, I hired it out and watched it deciding to form my own opinion. Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery would be a good movie if Mike Myers could act. I feel that his ability in this movie seriously undermines it. Now Mike Myers was in Wayne's World (playing I believe Wayne) and he played his role quite well, but Austin Powers just annoyed me. I thought that he tried too hard to create Austin Powers and it didn't come out well. Dr Evil (who went to Evil University for 6 years to get a PhD) was a little better (he was also played by Mike Myers) but I still think that it dragged the movie down. My friends quoted it much better than Myers delivered the lines. Another thing is that some of the jokes were overdone and were no longer funny. Whenever they had a henchman die they showed us that the death actually hurt people, but after a second time I was not really wanting to see another one. The toilet scene after Powers was defrosted went on too long and so was the penis enlarger joke. The joke about Danger being Austin Powers' middle name was clever but it was delivered so bad that it wasn't funny. Austin Powers is essentially a comedy which tries to poke fun at how 60's ideals are so out of date. Powers still wants to sleep around but in the 90's it has become somewhat frowned upon (according to the movie). Both Austin Powers and  Dr Evil are in another time in which all of their ideals are unknown. In the 60's Powers is a sex symbol and Dr Evil is a master villain but in the 90's all of Powers' charisma has gone and Dr Evil's schemes are no longer viable. For some reason Dr Evil wants to destroy the world but where does that get him other than watching millions of people suffer. The movie also pokes fun at how spy movies has the good guys caught and slowly tortured to death in a way that they can escape from where the 90's kid is simply telling his father to kill them with a gun. But then a gun is boring while a swarm of mutated sea bats are interesting. Austin Power, international man of mystery has a lot of potential to be a good movie but it fails to live up to what it claims to be. The opening was cool yet it failed because it didn't come out that well on the screen.

41,tomgillespie2002,A silly and effortlessly humorous 90 minutes,6,4 August 2014,"It's surprising to think that the second of two inspired characters thought up by Mike Myers, the flamboyant, sex-crazed super-spy Austin Powers, took so long to catch on. A modest showing at the box-office soon led to rampant word-of-mouth with it's VHS release, and soon enough, around the early 2000's, everybody seemed to responding to questions with ""yeah, baby!"". While it's hook is a mixture of (very accurately) spoofing 60's kitsch spy movies and outright silliness, Myers' Powers is winning thanks to the puppy-dog appeal of it's creator.After seeing his nemesis Dr. Evil (also Myers) escape his clutches by cryogenically freezing himself and escaping in a Big Boy-shaped space rocket, Austin Danger Powers joins the likes of Evil Knievel and Vanilla Ice and freezes himself for 30 years. When Evil returns, planning on stealing the world's nuclear weapons, Powers is thawed out and is unleashed into a changed world. No longer are people experimenting with mind-altering drugs and having care-free, unprotected sex, and Powers gets lumped with his ex-partner's buzz-killing daughter Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley).Myers seems fully aware that the 1960's were camp enough already to raise laughs, so the film spends a lot of time paying homage to the likes of the hyperactive energy of A Hard Day's Night (1964), the big- boobed laden, pervy fun of Beyond the Valley of the Dolls (1970), and even the ultra-chic photo-shoots of Antonioni's classic Blowup (1966). These scenes are surprisingly spot on, and Myers is in his element running away from an army of screaming girls to that now-iconic theme song. Of course, the film spends the majority of the film in the 1990's, and Powers seems incredibly out-dated, and people now notice his terrible teeth.Most of the laughs come from the clever observations made of the early James Bond movies. Anyone who remembers Honor Blackman's ridiculously named Pussy Galore from Goldfinger (1964), will get a laugh from the character named Alotta Fagina, or Dr. Evil's shoe-throwing henchman Random Task. Or for anyone who has seen any of the Sean Connery Bond's, will no doubt be amused at Dr. Evil's insistence on placing Powers in an easily-escapable and elaborate death device and refusing to even watch the deed, much to the annoyance of Evil's son (Seth Green). The rest of the laughs are hardly clever - they tend to derive from Myers gurning or daft innuendo - but this is a silly and effortlessly humorous 90 minutes, full of quotable lines that are no doubt as dated as Powers' outfits.www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

You'll either be in stitches or completely turned off by the sheer stupidity of the entire spectacle. Obviously, I fall into the former category (!)For a basic plot summary, ""Austin Powers"" is (at heart) a spoof of the old James Bond films from the 1960s. British spy Powers (Myers), with the help of Agent Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley) must track down and defeat the ""nefarious"", cat-stroking villain Dr. Evil (also Myers).Though the intentions of this film are clearly to lampoon Bond, it quickly becomes apparent that Myers' characters take on too much of a life of their own to be reigned in. As the movie progresses, the characters start to freelance a bit more and the humor really kicks up a notch. The groovy, swinging, shagadelic Powers and the utterly clueless Dr. Evil become, in just 90 minutes, iconic film characters producing handfuls of quotable, hilarious humor.Basically, ""Austin Powers"" is one of those rare comedies that bursts onto the scene out of nowhere and creates enough crazy characters to make people laugh.

Perhaps it has not aged well.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
44,johnnyboyz,"Neat, blasé comedy which gets the little things right on top of being a fun, energetic experience.",6,25 August 2013,"The humour at the centre of Austin Powers revolves around the stupidity of its two predominant characters, that is to say its eponymous hero and scheming chief villain. Neither character possess the requisite cans one needs to make up a six pack and yet in this film's mixed up universe, both of them have attained somewhat of a powerful position and the top of their respective fields. The pair, both of whom are depicted with ample relish by Mike Myers, embody a string of physical western traits often synonymous with fictitious heroes and villains, but with boundaries blurred in regards to their emotional states. In Austin Powers, the idea of the heroic cultural icon (who makes friends easily and exudes patriotism via his sports car decked out in the Union Jack) is cruelly undercut by distorted facial features and rampaging nymphomania. Likewise, his arch nemesis Dr. Evil is hideously hunched, scarred and intent on world domination - yet melts when he realises he possesses offspring. The pair of them are complete idiots, and they go about their business incompetently and badly - Powers just happens to always win because he is slightly less of an idiot.Jay Roach's 1997 film is an amusing spoof, one which predominantly targets that of the spy thriller; more specifically the James Bond franchise, although Powers himself resembles Michal Caine's Harry Palmer, another lead from a British spy series of the 1960s. It remembers that getting the narrative right in these sorts of things is just as important as sending up as much visual material as possible. The tone and excessive use of the voice-over in something like ""The Naked Gun: From the Files of Police Squad!"" are as important to the comedy as anything visually amusing in that film. Likewise with 2009's ""Black Dynamite"", wherein a narrative regarding the death of the lead's brother and the ridiculously complicated plot to do a governmental drug cover-up was just as crucial in its homage to poorly constructed grindhouse of the 1970s as anything else.It isn't a well-kept secret that, at the worst of times, stories in James Bond movies have often been derivative and simplistic. Bond movies are, in spite of their prestigious reputation and huge budgets, often mere B-movies dressed up as A-movies. ""Powers"" depicts a madman looking to erupt each and every volcano in the world for profitable means, something not too far removed from a Bond villain's idea but here played with the sort of happy, absurd energy often missing from a Bond film out of that fact if they don't play that for grimaces, they're going to look quite silly. The film begins in the 1960s and our resident lead's superiority over all whom attempt to vanquish him is reiterated by Dr. Evil in his conversing with several of the world's lead assassins: a ragtag bunch of Arabs, Latin Americans and paraplegics - none of whom have been so far able to kill Powers. Powers himself is a man introduced to us with his own exuberant song and dance number on a London street; a street so free of anything wrongful or nasty, you'd think they were paved with gold had there not been so many instances of a mid-shot being applied.After a skirmish at a local nightspot, Evil decides to freeze himself so that he may wreak havoc and chaos in the future; Powers additionally so in order to be able to thwart the man – the plot is essentially ""Demolition Man"". Social issues arise when both men are thawed in 1997, as life in each of the respective decades for the film's lead is pointed out as being very different. While far from a deeply engaging social critique of attitudes towards sexuality and communication, there is a timely sense of realisation during a montage whereby Powers learns of this newfound decade whereby everything he stood for in the past (speech, attitudes and even finger gestures) have effectively been rendered irrelevant. These scenes might very well be the film's best. On one hand, the film has things the wrong way around: people are far more prone to easy, anonymous sex in the present day when compared to forty years ago, where chaste attitudes were encouraged and people often subscribed to it. Furthermore, the sort of dialogue synonymous with Powers in the 60's would be far better suited to this incumbent climate, where the on-going rape of the English language in the form of abbreviations and acronyms making-do for words is the norm.Unfortunately, the film pulls its punches on any social scientific study in regards to the streets of London; where marching bands, warm smiles, cars decked out in the national colours and dance numbers have seemingly been replaced by swathes of immigrants that has rendered parts of the city as un-British as possible. The film itself is riddled with childish humour and inert remarks, but so what? Powers acts like a maniac in regards to sexual interaction, but resists taking advantage of women when they're drunk and is visibly nervous, even frightened, when the silhouette of a seductive young woman nude dominates his field of vision. My favourite scenes take place at the card table, wherein Powers loses a hand of blackjack with a five following a mean exchange with a baddie and double takes when he hears Alotta Fagina's name for the first time. The film isn't smart but it's smart enough; it knows its limits and never oversteps the mark, it's colourful and loud but never aggressive. There is a competent madness to ""International Man of Mystery"" and it's quite hard not to enjoy.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

47,Movie_Muse_Reviews,A James Bond spoof with its own groovy personality,7,12 December 2008,"There are parody movies and then there are movies that stand out individually while parodying other movies, and that's where ""Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery"" comes in. Driven by the incredibly talented character actor Mike Myers, Austin Powers is meant to be a vulgarization of everything that is James Bond, but at the same time, Powers and the surrounding cast are so unique that ""Austin Powers"" is really a franchise all in its own, with or without the Bond references.Austin Powers (Myers) is a 1960s British spy in the model of James Bond only he's less talented with his fists, hornier and uglier than Bond. His nemesis is Dr. Evil, also played by Myers, a bastardization of Blofeld of the early Bond films. Evil's plan is to cryogenically freeze himself and then come back in the future to try and hold the world ransom. Powers does the same and both are reawakened in the year 1997. This time travel element is probably to not alienate younger viewers who have no sense of the 1960s.Myers really showcases his talent for the first time in this film. Both Powers and Dr. Evil are unique, funny and likable. The strength of Dr. Evil in particularly is his sensitive side that we don't see in many villains in comedic films. Powers is such a strong protagonist because he brings some catchy 60s British jargon that is largely unexposed at this point to American audiences and other countries. The raunchy humor is also quite genius at times, which is about as high of a compliment as you can give raunchy humor.The movies is best described as silly, but clever silly, and there's certainly a lovable aspect to it. It's certainly not supposed to be plot driven and you really can't fault it for flaws in that area. It's just very rich with jokes (it would take multiple viewings to catch them all, especially the Bond references) and primarily structured on little sketches. I wouldn't call them gags because they are more cleverly integrated into the plot. Overall, ""Austin Powers"" is a shagadelic good time.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
48,Anonymous_Maxine,This should have been done years ago!!,8,19 August 2002,"In a time when we are almost constantly barraged with goofy spoof films, it's amazing that no one had come out with a spoof of the James Bond films until 1997. Those movies have been coming out and just BEGGING to be spoofed since the early 60s, and Mike Meyers is the one who finally steps forward to do what simply has to be done, and he does a wonderful job at it.Fans of the James Bond films will have a blast looking for all of the allusions to the old Bond films and trying to determine which Bond film is being spoofed at any given time, but it's important to keep in mind that the film pokes fun at the Bond series in good taste. Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery is never disrespectful to the films that it makes fun of, which is probably the single most important thing about a spoof film that makes it good. This is why the Scary Movies, as just a couple of examples, were such dismal, hideous failures. They try to be funny by viciously making fun of all kinds of movies, and end up looking stupid because they have such a nonexistent right to do that. You can't make a stupid, stupid movie and make fun of a lot of great movies (and some not so great, admittedly) and try to pretend to be respectable at the end of it all. That's the recipe for a crapfest.While it's true that a lot of the comedy in the first Austin Powers film is slapstick and obviously contrived, I think it should be a testament to the quality of the film that it is still so funny! We see all of the traditional Bond clichés in this movie, such as the usual one-liners (which are made fun of extensively and with spectacular effect here), the fancy cars, the goofy cockiness, the teeth-grinding theme song, and the occasionally inexplicable popularity with the women (this allusion makes most sense when compared to those Bond films that starred Roger Moore).The plot involves a rivalry between Dr. Evil, an evil mastermind bent on world domination, and Austin Powers, a mockish caricature of James Bond, bent on stopping Dr. Evil's world domination schemes. Meyers portrays both characters with hilarious skill, making Austin an awkward womanizer with some serious dental problems, and Dr. Evil an evil schemer with a hilarious cutesy side. Neither character really seems like they belong in the role that they serve (as a spy and a doctor of evil), which is where a lot of the comedy comes in. There is also, of course the fact that they both spend most of the movie 30 years in their future, completely out of touch with the new world that they live in.This is not a movie to be taken seriously, and quite frankly, I can't understand all of these reviews that I've read on the IMDb that are constantly complaining that Austin Powers is so cheesy or so childish. I've heard this same complaint about lots of other movies that are also not meant to be taken seriously, but this one is especially confusing. I trust that all you people complaining about how childish Austin Powers is realize that it is a spoof based on a whole series of movies that are also not meant to be taken seriously, right? I mean, that would be a hell of an oversight to miss that little detail. Austin Powers is one of the most refreshing comedies to come along in years, and it's sad that there are so many people who completely missed the boat on this one just because they pretend that the movie is something that it's not and was never meant to be. It's true that the movie is immensely immature and that it has unfortunately little re-watch value (one of the biggest problems with the film), but the quality of the comedy is unmistakable.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

Elizabeth Hurley was excellent in the film as well while she just lacked the unseriousness to be funny. Michael York was OK, nothing special. Mindy Sterling was definitely the best after Mike Myers of course. Seth Green would have come in next playing his role extremely well and Robert Wagner played it very well when he was getting frustrated by Dr Evil.

It's impressive enough for a film of this age to still retain so much of its initial charm, but to do so with the added weight of two derivative sequels, aping the original's best jokes at every turn, is borderline miraculous. Myers is at his rapid-fire best throughout this picture, setting up punchlines like dramatic authors might dangle plot threads, while somehow keeping the simple, delightful, central storyline in sight at all times. A biting satire of 60's culture and, naturally, the James Bond flicks that primarily celebrated it, there's no shortage of ammunition for the SNL alum's comic WMDs, but amidst so many presses of that red button there's also a sweet, tangible thought at its core.

54,Lechuguilla,Forced Humor,3,30 July 2014,"What a great premise: 1960s hero and arch villain both frozen, then unfrozen after thirty years to resume their global fight for power. A satire of the James Bond series, ""Austin Powers ..."" (played by Mike Myers) is a real disappointment. I laughed a couple of times. Otherwise, I endured the crude gags, stilted gimmicks, and the repellent character of Powers, with that grimaced smile and those ugly teeth.The problem here is the writing. The script just isn't funny. The humor is all forced. And there's a lot of missed opportunities. For example, Austin opens up a laptop, a device that wasn't available in the 1960s. Yet, he has no problem using it to chatter with Number Two (Robert Wagner). What an ideal setup for some laughs about changes in technology. But no; the script passes over this opportunity for some real comparisons to the 60s. Instead, we get way too much time spent on Porky's style bathroom ""humor"" that has nothing to do with cultural changes.The film is certainly colorful, as was the style for much of the latter half of the 1960s. Cinematography dazzles with flashy, glitzy, glittering visuals. But for what purpose? Probably the best element is the music. At least they brought back a couple of pop songs from the 60s. And the score is quite reminiscent of the earlier era.Casting is what it is. If you like Mike Myers, you'll no doubt like the film, since ""Austin Powers ..."" is basically a Mike Myers vehicle. Otherwise, the casting is largely irrelevant. Performances, beyond Myers' silliness, are neither good nor bad, since they're all exaggerated.I had hoped for humor that was more natural, more organic, and some clever comparisons to the 1960s. I got neither. This film is a blunt, in-your-face cinematic example of shallow, puerile, trashy insignificance that I suppose Mike Myers has become known for.

It had everyone laughing at the theater I saw this in. But it's not hard to imagine this film taking time to reach an audience, or latching on so well once it did.""Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery"" or AP1, as I will refer to it, is a repellant, stupid, sky-high-on-itself little comedy that grows on you like a tumor, albeit a very benign one. Mike Myers wrote his own starring vehicle to demonstrate he still had a film career after milking the ""Wayne's World"" franchise dry. His Austin Powers is a lecherous British toad who lives a life of superspy danger, impossibly beautiful women, and appalling velvet fashion statements.He might have been funny for about 10 minutes, 15 tops, but what keeps the movie going are two other things. One is Michael Myers' other character, Dr. Evil, a bizarrely low-key megavillain who really can sustain comedy for long stretches at a time, belittling his henchmen and waving his cat around like a pointing stick. The other is the look and feel of this movie, a very detailed and vibrant homage to a certain type of 1960s look, call it Swinging London, that is very spot-on and disciplined even in its surreal goofiness. Notice there are wide-waled corduroys, ridiculous hats, miniskirts, but no paisley in evidence. Paisley would make it late-1960s flower-power rather than what it is, mid-1960s Mary Quant. It's not like you have to know any of this. It's just there, eye candy that serves the message of the film.And what is the message? Austin throws up a statement at the end which is supposed to sum it all up, that freedom and responsibility together are a groovy thing and so on, but for me the purpose of this film is twofold. One is to make you laugh, which it does. Not all the time. The bathroom bits are overdone to be sure, and Myers' idea of comic genius at times is to beat a joke into the ground and then stomp on it a bit more for good measure. But the film is funny, in part because Myers is no snob about making you laugh. He sees something funny, he goes for it. He's one present-day comic not afraid of shtick.The other purpose is a homage to the spy movie, specifically the Sean Connery James Bond movies; Bond imitators Matt Helm (Dean Martin), Harry Palmer (Michael Caine), and Derek Flint (James Coburn); and the over-the-top 1960s Bond farce ""Casino Royale,"" which was the cinematic equivalent of the Hindenburg but remains a film everyone should see once. Peter Sellers in that last film is clearly a model for Austin: There's even a scene where Austin strikes poses on a revolving bed much like Sellers did in a 'Casino' scene with Ursula Andress. Myers said one of the 'Flint' movies was his favorite growing up, and clearly he is having nostalgic fun sending it all up. Bad cinema is impervious to satire, but these films weren't bad, and the kind of satire doled out in AP1 is never less than affectionate.Great opening credit sequence especially. I love the scene where Michael York plays the circa-1960s Basil Exposition; he looks like Brian Jones. This was followed by one sequel that was a little funnier though less focused and soulful, and then another several cuts below in quality, but this remains the definite Austin Powers film.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

However there would be no Goldmember without this one first having been released and a success.
I remember the first time I saw it and how I was hooked after just a few minutes by the fantastic opening sequence to The Soul Bossa Nova! I laughed hysterically all the way through back then and still laugh out loud today.
I love the silly jokes, the cameos (Christian Slater is genius in his role) and the fantastically funny and obscure mind of the writer, producer and lead, Mr Myers. When he plays a part, he really goes all out and he manages to do a great job playing two parts in this film.
The supporting cast is fantastic and although I would normally discuss how gorgeous Rob Lowe was (Which he obviously was and still is), I have to say there is a special place in my heart for both Miss and Mrs Kensington in those cat suits. I also love Basil, it's quite a small part for Mr York, but I love his typically British essence which works so well for a James Bond spoof, far superior to David Niven's effort, although I love him too!Brilliant writing, story, characters, actors, cutaways and good fun innuendo for all.

Here is why I didn't like it much:Obvously-this movie isn't supposed to be taken seriously AT ALL. It's a comedy. But the trouble is, I just didn't find it that funny. Maybe this just isn't my brand of humor. I like comedies as a genre-for instance Something about Mary is a great one. It is vulgar at times yet manages to be funny ALL the time! With Austin Powers, it just doesn't work. Or maybe it does-for about the first 30 minutes-after that, it just becomes overdone and overplayed. And somewhat obnoxious. But then again, there are some people who hate Something about Mary so who knows-everyone has their favorites...I think the acting was wonderful-but Austin Powers is the type of movie, I think, one will either adore or just not like at all. It's not a 1 or 2 for me, which I thought it would be but it Also didn't get above the average mark for me and I wouldn't see it again.I'd say this is watchable but a bit tedious after awhile and sometimes obnoxious without lacking the true hilarity necessary in an obnoxious comedy to make it great(though I did appreciate the ending.)But overall, this never really made me laugh that much nor did it leave a lasting impression on me. Another thing- I have not seen the sequels except for the first few minutes of number 2 which throughly ruined any enjoyment I got from this one anyway so I doubt I'll be watching any more Austin Powers sequels.

For those who are too young to know; people did actually dress like him for a while. The sexual and sexist jokes are all par for the course and though politically-incorrect are still a great deal of fun.Myers plays both the hero and the villain - Dr Evil, and does each with a spoofy panache. All of the other characters do their adequate bit, including the seemingly ageless Robert Wagner.It's just a fun movie, but I have to say that I think it could have been a whole lot wittier with two such subjects to lampoon. Time and again I was expecting a far more comical result than the one I actually got.It maybe the 1960's just can't be spoofed. Like the saying goes; 'if you weren't there, you're square' and Mr Myers clearly wasn't. I think the decade was so iconic that it was its own self-parody. Check out 'Bedazzled' with Cooke and Moore and 'The Italian Job' with Micheal Caine. Both knock this into a cocked-hat.Still; it's worth a watch - I especially enjoyed the 'spontaneous' Dancing-In-The-Street sequence at the beginning, a hint at Martha Reese and The Mammas & The Pappas, both of whom made the song a 60's hit.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

The first film is a goofy 90 minutes of quasi-vulgarity and slapstick, but it's got some decent heart in there as Austin is hit with the realization that his swinging, free-loving, chauvinist style doesn't fly as well in the 90's. Thirty years have passed and Dr. Evil's lameness is practically the norm. Austin confronts the concept of personal responsibility and finds love in Vanessa Kensington, the beautiful daughter of his partner from the 60s.I used to love Mike Myers. He was great on SNL and I loved both the WAYNE'S WORLD and AUSTIN POWERS series. He hasn't quite seen the same success in the new millennium (with the exception of the SHREK franchise) but this movie came at his strong point and his mojo-oozing secret agent is just getting started here. Myers pulls a double role, also performing as Dr. Evil and doing a spot on impression of Ernst Stavro Blofeld from the 007 movies. Elizabeth Hurley is gorgeous as Vanessa and a perfect foil for Austin's libidinous obsessions. Rounding out the cast are Robert Wagner, Seth Green, Michael York, and Will Ferrell in a bit part. There's a lot to enjoy here and I've seen the movie countless times over the years; it never gets old. The spastic humor and campy style pay homage to the most obvious well-known elements of the classic spy movies and leave the viewer (in my case, anyway) waiting for Austin ""Danger"" Powers' next adventure.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
67,Gislef,Humorous Satire 5 - Repulsive Myers 2,6,2 February 1999,"The Satire wins out, but it's a close call.  Myers-as-Powers is incredibly repulsive in this movie (he's great as Dr. Evil).  There's a lot of spoofing going on here, and it's a lot more focused than, say, your average Hot Shots or Police Squad movie.  But a little bit of Myers goes a long, long, long way.  The movie also runs out of steam a bit, so near the end we're reduced to watching Powers endlessly try to move his go-cart.  The Dr. Evil scenes are hilarious though, and clearly the best part of the movie.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

Get it at Amazon.)This is a James Bond spoof aimed at retro nerds so that we might find an identification in our deprived lives. Hey, in this movie we get to cozy up--in your dreams, retard!-- to Elizabeth (drooling all over myself) Hurley. The flick sparkles (if that's the right word) with lame-o jokes and semi-sophisticated satire.Mike Myers wrote the script and stars as both Austin, the man of mystery (right, like the toe jam smell at the bottom of your closet is a mystery), and the cartoon villain Dr. Evil, who might be Dr. No cleaning his teeth with his pinkie. Speaking of teeth, he has the better teeth of our disjointed duo, speaking of which, notice that Hurley (would that Emma Peel had anything like her figure, but she too was English) doesn't actually soul kiss Austin. I mean, there are not only LIMITS, but contract clauses. I think Hurley was afraid that if she actually swapped tongues with him she would catch some horrid fungus amongus and THAT wouldn't be good for her career. However, check this out: for her next Austin Powers opus, ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" she got $3-million up front.Look at it this way: if she could make flirty-flirty eyes with Rancid Teeth Man, she could conceivably, in your wildest dreams find YOU attractive, at least as the last man on earth. You and Elizabeth Hurley as the last two humans on earth! Eat your heart out, Sean Connery. Heck, all he had in Dr. No (1962) was Ursula Andress. (Come to recall: yummie, yum, yum.) And you too, Roger Moore. ""Bond, James Bond,"" yourself.Myers makes himself as disgustingly nerdish as possible, but still the chicks swoon. There's some right-on satire here about the mystery of feminine desire. What DOES a woman want? The nerds never know but James Bond, Harrison Ford and (gulp) Mike Myers don't have to ask.All right, there is a plot to this Batman-like take off on the sixties become the nineties 007 spy diversion. But it's so familiar that I won't bother with it here. Some of the characters are interesting. There's Alotta Fagina played by Fabiana Udenio recalling Octopu**y and Pu**y Galore. (Well, she's not interesting, but her name is.) And think about this: Robert Wagner with the eye patch who was once a sophisticated ladies man--for example, The Pink Panther (1964)--is now a bloated old man having to wear extra large suit coats to hide his pot belly and sagging flesh. Now THAT evens the score for the old nerds who never got the girl, who, by the way, will like this as much as pimple-popping sixteen year olds.Myers knows what he's doing. There's a deep psychological seduction underneath the sixties garb and the nineties toilet humor that makes this strangely satisfying. For my part however I could only bear to watch it all the way to the very, very end in the hope that (PG-13 rating aside) that Hurley would disrobe a little and I could get a glimpse of that exquisite bod. But they teased me, especially in the matrimonial bed scene with the pineapples and the melons and the spice rack--whatta rack! Ha, ha, ha, ha.Remember as you watch this: it is not as bad as it looks. In fact, once you understand what Mike Myers is doing to your psyche, you might want to see it again.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

Like a man, man.",7,20 July 2010,"He's the sexiest, swingingest secret agent ever to combat evil - DOCTOR Evil, that is.... mwohahaha ha ha ha....He's Austin Powers, arguably Mike Myers's greatest, most memorable, most embraced, most quoted icon - in the film that made it all shagadelic, baby. AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY is a hip skewering of the spy movie genre, taking especial aim at James Bond. The more you know James, the more you'll love Austin.Myers is Austin Powers: superspy, posh Brit accent, smashing fashion sense, a Byrds wig, unruly teeth, and a gigantic male... symbol draped around his neck. We meet him dancing in the streets of 1960s swinging London, and I think he's doing The Froog.Austin Powers's nemesis is Doctor Evil (also played by Myers), a marriage of Donald Pleasance's Blofeld (from YOU ONLY LIVE TWICE) and apparently, as Myers confesses, Lorne Michaels (his producer on Saturday NIGHT LIVE). Myers whipcracks it out of the park with Dr. Evil, for as everyone knows, a hero is nothing without the villain who loves to hate him. And Myers immortalizes his hero and villain by imbuing them both with equal amounts of thunderball mojo.In the opening 1960s sequence, Dr. Evil escapes Powers by cryogenically freezing himself in an orbital rocket. So Powers volunteers to freeze himself as well, to combat Dr. Evil should he ever return to Earth. In the 1990s, Dr. Evil returns, sets up his underground lair in Nevada and tries to blackmail the world governments for ""one MILLion DOLLars!"" at which point his Number Two (Robert Wagner, brilliantly playing it straight) advises him that one million dollars isn't much these days. When he changes his ransom to ""one HUNdred BILLion DOLLars,"" we start to twig to this movie's hook. It is part spy spoof, part fish-out-of-water, all Swedish-made penis enlarger.Meanwhile, Powers (unfrozen after 30 years, as the only man able to combat Dr. Evil) is having his own revelations - that the 90s are not as promiscuous as the 60s he left behind, and the slinky flirtations he engaged in with his previous spy partner, Mrs. Kensington (tightly leathered Mimi Rogers) are wasted on his current salubrious spy hard, Mrs. Kensington's daughter, Vanessa (achingly beautiful Elizabeth Hurley), a 90s woman, i.e. repressed and uptight about her sexuality. Which might explain Hugh's wayward thrust with that skank. (As Bill Maher has noted, ""The most beautiful woman in the world – somebody's sick of f-king her!"") The innocence of both hero and villain in a world that has left them behind is this movie's greatest hook. Snappily written by Myers and directed by Jay Roach like a man, man.Mindy Sterling is Dr. Evil's loudmouth secretary, Will Ferrell is a skin-darkened evil henchman, Michael York gamely plays Austin's boss, Basil Exposition, Fabiana Udenio is evil siren, Alotta Fagina (Pussy Galore, anyone?), and Seth Green perfectly captures X-Gen angst as Scott Evil, Dr. Evil's estranged son, whose pragmatic solutions to Dr. Evil's ""Bond Villain"" snares are a constant source of vexation for Dr. Evil.Does that make you HORNY, baby, yeah?",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

Judging by the enthusiasm and walloping energy he infused into writing,producing and(of course)acting in the films,I'd say that there is definitely a lot of love and personal investment in it.Myers plays both the title character and his arch-nemesis,Dr.Evil,as they are both products of the deep Cold WAr 1960s and the swanky,kitchy era that framed it. Both have been deep-frozen,and when Dr.Evil is unthawed in 1997,British Intelligence goes and unthaws POwers,who is sent to(big surprise)thwart Dr. Evil's plans. Along for the mission is Powers' one-time affiliate's daughter,the fetching Vanessa Kenzington(Elizabeth Hurley,never better fit for a film than here). Meanwhile,Dr.Evil(Ernst Blofeld look and all)has personal revelations of his own:namely,a genetically produced offspring that is an angry,back-talking son named Scott(Seth Green,full-froth). An ensuance of sight gags,pratfalls,an attempt at seduction(simultaneously done by Powers and an Italian vixen/spy(FAbiana Udenio),a romantic interlude(fostered along by Mr.Burt Bacharach!)in LAs Vegas,and a showdown in Evil's mountain lair all come into play before the film's fitful conclusion.Directed with transparency by JAy Roach,Myers ups the ante from his Wayne's World movies by giving these films as retro and kitchy as possible,replete with musical numbers,full-on Birtish slang and a cheekiness factor of ten! I--like many people--saw this film first on video,and it was a film that,FYI,was actually much more successfully in second release for home vid than it was in theatrical first release. Somewhat ironic,since the ensuing Austin POwers equals were probably,in my opinion,descending(though not bad any a one,really)in quality,yet did considerably better each in box office.

To me, I think that was probably his best film. His next big hits were Waynes World and Waynes World 2. Which, I loved both of those. A few years after Wayne's World, Myers came up with one of the most memorable characters ever. Austin Powers was a success with critics but not quite at the box office. But after the first one, the series got more and more successful. Austin Powers: International man of mystery is the first film in the series. And by far the best. Austin Powers: International Man of mystery is so stupid that it's funny. In case you don't know, Austin Powers, the entire trilogy, is making fun of James Bond. If you've seen some of the Bond films, then you will know. For instance, instead of Pussy Galore, there's a character named Alotta Vagina. I won't spoil anymore of Austin Powers's fun. If you haven't seen Austin Powers, you should wake up and smell the roses. Austin Powers: International Man of mystery is hilarious. It's obvious that you should see it.

74,blott2319-1,A baffling mixed bag that only works sometimes.,5,19 June 2020,"When I originally saw Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery back in the 90s, I remember thinking it was mildly funny but it wasn't hilarious enough that I rushed out to buy a copy. Watching it now I found it more odd and puzzling than anything else. It really baffles me how they made this choice to blend a clear James Bond parody with a parody of a Beatles movie. Why the meshing of those two styles made sense to anyone is beyond me. Because I'm an avid fan of the James Bond franchise, what works for me in this film is everything to do with Dr. Evil. His personality is silly, and his henchmen are all humorous. I even love how Seth Green comes in as the voice of reason saying the things that so many of us have thought about Bond villains for decades. There are moments where they push the character of Dr. Evil a bit too far, and it loses some of the humor. But because I have a lot of knowledge about what he is spoofing, it doesn't bother me all that much.What doesn't work for me in Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery is everything else. Austin Powers himself is a horribly annoying character in every way. I don't want to root for this idiot, I want to judo-chop him in the face. It feels like the film is trying to turn his outdated views on sex into a joke, but then rewards him with unprotected sex with multiple partners, so any humor is lost. Of course, the mere idea of women finding him sexy is a bit ridiculous as well, but we won't go there. The strange interstitial music breaks are pointless, and really drive home that 60s Beatles vibe. Finally, the two LONG scenes of naked characters covering their private parts with conveniently placed items lose any humor after about 5 seconds, even though they seem to drag on for more than 5 minutes. That is actually the biggest weakness of the humor in this film...not knowing when to stop a joke. If I could just have a Dr. Evil movie, then I'd be a happy camper, but since this is titled Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery, I don't feel much need to revisit it again.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

Dr. Evil proceeds to do the only logical thing, escape in a rocket ship disguised as a Big Boy statue and cryogenically freeze himself (and his cat). Austin Powers volunteers to be frozen in case Dr. Evil returns to wreak havoc in the future. Thirty years pass. It's 1997 and Dr. Evil is back. Time to unfreeze Austin Powers who is about to find out the '90s aren't quite as groovy as the '60s.Dr. Evil plots to steal a nuclear weapon and hold the world hostage for one million dollars! Er, one hundred billion dollars! A million bucks just doesn't buy what it used to. Dr. Evil has got a lot to catch up on, as does Austin Powers, the product of the swinging '60s who is very much out of place in the more sedate '90s. This leads to some good laughs, many of which center around Austin's attempt to get his new partner, the stunningly beautiful Vanessa Kensington, to sleep with him. Sadly, Austin's tried-and-true '60s seduction techniques aren't going to work on Vanessa. Meanwhile, there's the small matter of foiling Dr. Evil's dastardly plan.The movie maybe never hits the heights of comedic genius. It's never uproariously funny but it is reasonably amusing. And charming too. Mike Myers does very well with the dual roles of Austin Powers and Dr. Evil though there is the nagging sense that the bad guy is funnier than the titular hero. There is little question the funniest moments come from Dr. Evil, the prototypical James Bond villain who knows he's the prototypical James Bond villain. Among other things this means he must have over-elaborate ways of doing everything when he knows darned well a simpler way would surely suffice. And it also of course means he is fated to be frustrated. What's a guy got to do to get some sharks with frickin' laser beams attached to their heads? Dr. Evil is a hoot, Austin Powers sometimes less so but you root for him. He's charming in his own very unique way. Maybe Vanessa will even come to love him. Happily Elizabeth Hurley, playing Vanessa, proves to be a model who can actually act. She more than holds her own with Myers, the two work well together. There are other familiar faces in the cast, including Michael York, Robert Wagner and Seth Green, who all do well with their respective roles. But the movie obviously belongs to Myers, this is his baby. And he pulls it off well enough. Yes, the humor is hit and miss but there are enough hits to keep you smiling.

78,Beta_Gallinger,"Actually funny, unlike certain other James Bond spoofs",8,5 April 2009,"I was eleven years old around the time this hit comedy came into stores, so I was perhaps a little too young to see it. When I was sixteen, all three of the Austin Powers movies were out in stores, and I finally watched them all in reverse order. I have now seen each of them several times, and recently watched this one, the original ""Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery"", for the first time in a couple years (back when I last watched the entire trilogy). It was my first time seeing it after watching all the James Bond movies in order, so I now understand some of the parodies, and I think my latest viewing of this 1997 comedy was a lot like the one before it. I may not like it as much as I did as a teenager, but I still laughed, you can be sure about that. It's definitely more watchable than the 1967 version of ""Casino Royale"", and probably certain other lacklustre Bond spoofs as well.In 1967, Austin Powers is a British secret agent and a stereotypical 60's womanizer. His archenemy is Dr. Evil, a man with plans for world domination! One night, while the agent chases after his foe, the evil doctor manages to get away in a rocket, where he cryogenically freezes himself, and plans to return sometime in the future! Powers is then cryogenically frozen so he will be available to continue his battles against the madman whenever he happens to come back. Dr. Evil finally returns from suspended animation thirty years later, in 1997, and immediately reunites with his colleagues to figure out new ways to try and take over the world! So, Powers is unfrozen and sent with Vanessa Kensington, the daughter of a woman he worked with in the 60's, to once again try and foil his archenemy's plans. Unfortunately for Powers, a lot has changed in thirty years, and his womanizing ways will no longer be tolerated.Comedian Mike Myers, who wrote the story, plays two characters in the film, Austin Powers and Dr. Evil. He does a good job with both, playing a likable, charming fool and goofy parody of James Bond villain Ernst Stavro Blofeld. Both of these characters can still make me laugh with their antics. The washroom stall gag, Powers mistaking the mother of his boss, Basil Exposition, for a man in disguise, and the conflict between Dr. Evil and his son, Scott, are three things I can point out as comic highlights, but those aren't the only ones. Certain other characters can be quite funny as well, such as Frau Farbissina, a villain played by Mindy Sterling, with her screech, and Mustafa, Dr. Evil's henchman played by Will Ferrell, even though this chararacter isn't in the film for long. Yes, this is a raunchy comedy, with sex, nudity, and some language, which I don't have a problem with, as long as it's funny, but if this type of dirty humour bothers you, and/or you don't care for Mike Myers as a comedian, then ""Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery"" is not for you.

79,vip_ebriega,Swingin' 60's Baby... yeah!,8,12 May 2008,"My Take: Definitely one of the funniest spy movie spoof ever.One is a the hottest spy of the 60's. Even with bad teeth, he has a way with the women (in the 60's that is). The other one is a megalomaniac, reminiscence of James Bond's mortal enemy Ernst Blofeld. All he wants is to rule the world, and is the worst enemy of that super-spy. That spy your sure to love is Austin Powers, and that megalomaniac is the ""sinister"" Dr. Evil, and both are played by Mike Myers, and when they were frozen in the 60's and reawakened during the 90's, their fish-out-of-water.All this and so much more are in AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY, an immensely enjoyable and funny spoof of the classic James Bond movies, an idea that proved to be some failure in 1967's CASINO ROYALE parody. Although not every joke in this movie will make you laugh like a fool, all the jokes are right on timing, as they are quite relevant. And the film's biggest long-running joke, wherein two 60's inhabitants try to blend in to the much-changed 90's atmosphere, is slick and cleverly idealistic.The plot in a nutshell concerns Austin Powers and Dr. Evil (both played by Myers) confronting each other once again in the 90's. Evil's plan is to gain profit from world leaders and, after a number of bad and dated ideas (Framing Prince Charles to divorce and putting a hole in the atmosphere which all supposedly happened), he finally comes up with a plan to use a warhead to terrorize the world for 100 billion dollars. Elizabeth Hurley co-stars as Vanessa, Austin's fellow agent not attracted by Austin's approach to sex (""Do I make you horny, baby?"", Michael York also co-stars as Basil Exposition, Austin's boss and Robert Wagner as Number 2, Dr. Evil's ""cycloptic"" colleague (he wears an eye-patch).There are a few uneven jokes that fall short of the point, but majority are really great jokes, like ones that exceed upon the PG-13 rating it was limited to. Myers is a natural, carrying two roles in one film, making them both very hilarious and interesting. Director Jay Roach is very energetic and fun-loving in his work. The script, co-written by Myers, is filled with jokes we thought will never work. Turns out they will, if given to the right hands.A very funny comedy, surprisingly holds up very memorably.Rating: **** out of 5.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
80,gftbiloxi,An Antidote For A Rainy Day,8,18 April 2005,"I'm not a Mike Myers fan, and I avoided this film--and its sequels--like the plague when they were on the big screen. But I now know the error of my ways: AUSTIN POWERS is one of the freshest bits of purely entertaining, mindless fluff to come along in quite a while, the perfect antidote to an overcast and bad-mood sort of day.The story is an amalgamation of the more excessive plot ideas of such films as DIAMONDS ARE FOREVER and OUR MAN FLINT. Fashion photographer by day and swinging spy by night, Austin Powers is the toast of psychedelic London--and more than a match for Dr. Evil. But when Dr. Evil has himself frozen, Powers does the same, and the two defrost some thirty years later and resume their battle in the much more up-tight 1990s. The most obvious target of the spoof is the James Bond films, but fans of 1960s film will have a field day spotting the film's take offs on such characters as Matt Helm, Derek Flint, Emma Peel, celebrities like The Beatles and Andy Warhol, and such diverse films as THE TENTH VICTIM and the camp classic DR. GOLDFOOT AND THE GIRL BOMB. And dare we mention the sixties' own classic swinging spy spoof, the infamous CASINO ROYALE? Myers is greatly amusing in the double role of Austin Powers and Dr. Evil, both of whom have considerable difficulty adjusting to everything from safe sex to inflation, and Elizabeth Hurley is quite good in the Diana Rigg-ish role of sidekick Vanessa Kensington. But the real fun here is in the details--and the details include every one from Michael York to Robert Wagner to Burt Bacharach to Carrie Fisher, ""Fembots"" with killer pasties, and Italian sexpot Fabiana Udenio as a character with the most devastating name since Honor Blackman hit the screen in GOLDFINGER. The soundtrack is just as swinging as it gets, with blasts of everything from ""These Boots Are Made For Walking"" and ""I Touch Myself."" And look for a hilarious spoof of Bob Fosse-inspired choreography during the main credits! You won't find any deep thoughts in AUSTIN POWERS, and thank heaven for it: giggles and grins are the order of the day, and the film delivers them in abundance.

81,KnightsofNi11,"Silly, but a great parody",7,13 June 2012,"Mike Myers is quite the character, and I mean that literally. He's undoubtedly great at coming up with over the top and eccentric characters and Austin 'Danger' Powers is probably his most famous. Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery is the first film in the Austin Powers series where Meyers stars as the suave British secret agent, as well as his nemesis, the pasty white Dr. Evil. The film opens in the 60's where promiscuous sex and drugs are the essence of popular culture and Powers is living it up, womanizing left and right as the sex symbol of all of Britain. But while Powers is foiling a plot of Dr. Evil's, Evil cryofreezes himself to escape. Powers has no other option but to cryofreeze himself so that he may be unfrozen if Dr. Evil ever decides to return. Thus we are thrown into present day, which in this case is the 90's, where Powers must foil Dr. Evil's plot to take over the world. Utter goofiness ensues, some of it completely idiotic, some of it completely hilarious.Austin Powers is a perfect poster child for parody films, and it does a hilariously great job at parodying the rampant sexual innuendos, overly cheesy plot lines, and stereotypically flat characters of 1960's spy films. Thus, the entire film is spent making fun of other films, thus any inconsistency, continuity error, or plot hole exists only to perpetuate the parody theme of the film. Thus, you can't judge Austin Powers on its plot, characters, or most things that you normally would judge a film for. You can really only judge it on its humor. The film has one goal and one goal only, to make the audience laugh. So basically if it makes you laugh it passes, if it doesn't it fails. In my case, I laughed so there... the film passes in my book.There's not much else to say. I'm not really the biggest fan of goofy humor, but I laughed out loud more than once during this film. And while it is mostly silly antics riddled with fart and poop jokes, there's a baseline of cleverness that runs through the film that makes it a lot of fun to watch. You can only enjoy this film for exactly what it is on the surface, and I most certainly did.

Other differences with most spoofs are, that this film has a quite subtle form of humor (unlike for instance Scary Movie) and that this film does not get toot crazy and 'over the top' with it's jokes (like Hot Shots and any Leslie Nielsen film). This spoof, actually gets you involved in the characters and the story and never produces an awkward moment when a joke falls flat (which does not even happen if I remember it right for myself). All of this is the achievement of the great cast and the director who also did a splendid job (not to mention the casting people who provided the necessary' eye candy). International man of mystery is a good film in it's genre (spy-a-delic spoof), but no overall classic.

It's a genuine comedy classic and Mike Myers is so darn funny as Austin Powers, British secret agent, and just as good as Dr. Evil, Belgium evil genius. Mike Myers wrote a sensational script. Honestly! Elizabeth Hurley looks very shagadelic as Vanessa Kensington. I find Elizabeth Hurley to be extremely attractive. Mimi Rogers as Mrs. Kensington, shall we shag now or shag later? Robert Wagner is suited perfectly as Dr. Evil's number two, Number Two. I'm a real fan of Mindy Sterling, she is hilarious as Frau Farbissina! Michael York's classic in the scene with Basil's mother. ""That's not your mother. It's a man, baby."" Hahahaha! Seth Green as Scotty Evil is my favorite. All of the moments with Scotty and Dr. Evil are great. Tom Arnold makes himself a classy appearance. I wasn't planning on doing this, and I really don't want to do it, but I have to mention Will Ferrell because Will Ferrell's part is hilarious! HaHaHaHaHaHaHaHa! And of course Mr. Bigglesworth makes the movie complete. Meooooww. I really love all the music in Austin Powers. Austin Powers 1 is full of strong shtick from start to finish which very well may cause extremely combustible severe spontaneous bursts of explosive and uproarious laughter, and the 2nd one's even funnier!

85,The_Movie_Cat,"""Austin, it's a swinging shindig!""",6,2 December 2000,"I'm not quite sure why, but whenever I watch an Austin Powers film I'm always filled with a growing sense of disappointment. It's certainly not because of the two lead characters, who are destined to fuel many late night ""who's the funniest?"" drinking debates. I still can't make up my mind on that score. While the humour is occasionally near the knuckle (see the ""Mama Cass"" joke), it's usually affectionate, and Myer's cod English accent has me in stitches every time. I particularly love his use of antiquated Brit phrases (""Shut yer cakeole""; ""on yer bike""), though if I wanted to be picky I'd point out no Englishman would ever say ""carnies"" or ""popsicle"". Dr.Evil is just as good, his description of his father - ""made outrageous claims that he invented the question mark and had a penchant for buggery"" - being particularly amusing.One of the ways in which this humour is successful is an almost ""Carry On"" style of audacity over cheese. So that Austin's answer to ""how dare you break wind before me"" being the ancient ""I'm sorry baby, I didn't realise it was your turn"" produces a laugh at the spirited lameness of it, rather than wincing. Lots of the jokes are like this, and though the ""private parts covered by strategically placed inanimate objects"" (one of the few things they did better in the sequel, using sillouettes) doesn't really work, most of them get by. The Bond gags are spot-on, too, and anyone citing them as unsophisticated is missing the point. Names like Basil Exposition, Patty O'Brien and Random Task are perfect mickey-takes, as well as Frau Farbissina's vocation as ""founder of the militant wing of the Salvation Army"". Evil's plan of ""let's just do what we always do, hijack some nuclear weapons and hold the world hostage"" ably illustrates the agenda.However, while all these gags are pretty funny in a lovably juvenile way, I always find that the laughter stops after the first half an hour. I initially thought that this was because the films couldn't maintain their momentum, and while this is partly true, it's not wholly the case. I happened to catch a bit of this at the usually lacking half-way point and laughed just as loudly as I normally do at the start. It turns out that while the two leads have a very funny joke each, it IS just a single joke, and no film can survive on such a paltry supply. The budget-heavy sequel saw Michael McCullers join Myers as a co-writer, and it wasn't nearly as good. While some of the setpieces were inspired - Dr.Evil on Jerry Springer and a Thomas Crown Affair spoof - generally it was a flat retread. Quite amusing when watched alone, seen in conjunction with International Man of Mystery it's a reheated rehash. A quick example is the innuendo names for the villainous girls. The first gave us Alotta Fagina, the sequel Ivana Humpalot. The first is clearly the funnier version of the same joke, something that's symptomatic of the whole movie. The first was a likeable, knockabout parody of culture clashes and the Bond franchise. The Spy Who Shagged Me is a parody of Austin Power's own cult. Many of the jokes are reused wholesale, including multiple puns about a dead guard, the prolonged laughing gag and Mustafa still being alive, though out of sight. The only new additions to the formula fail to work. The only reason to watch So I Married An Axe Murderer was Myer's joint role as a drunken Scotsman, so it's rather odd that here the Scots ""Fat B*****d"" falls singularly flat. Mini-Me, Dr.Evil's clone, is also too vicious-looking to really appeal. A smugness pervades the whole piece, and the product placement of a certain lager (which reportedly increased sales by 15%) is as inappropriate as the unnecessary plugs for AOL in both films.This film, and its sequel, do make me laugh. Just never as much as I'd like them to.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

Although the script is slightly anemic and some of the jokes not very funny, because Mike Myers is portraying not one but two characters (the title character Austin Powers and his nemesis Dr. Evil), it makes up for any weaknesses. In fact Mike Myers is so spot-on and properly cast, there's no way you couldn't like his performances in this film.

Even then the concept could have worked. But there are too many ""fish out of water"" jokes and the others aren't really funny either. A long-haired cat becoming bald is hardly amusing.

Among all parodies that have been made after ""James Bond"". I think Austin Powers is the best, the most funny and creative. Not only did Mike Myers wrote the script for this film but he also portrays both the protagonist and the antagonist, Dr. Evil. Both Powers and Dr. Evil are iconic characters in cinema history and so once this movie came out, till this day they are icons of cinema. The music is funny and gives the film a more jumpy tone. All the colors in the scenes of the 60's match the reality of the 60's in England. The hidden jokes and charismatic look of Austin add a lot to the humor. Overall a must watch movie for all those in favor of parodies, once you've seen this film, you will know what is like to be Shagged.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
100,FilmFanInTheHouse,Shagtastic!,7,9 June 2007,"Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (1997, Dir. Jay Roach)Story Mike Myers plays Austin Powers. A sex-mad spy who worked in the 60's along with Mrs. Kensington. He freezes himself and later released in the late 90's. Times are very different for Austin, who still believes that the sex lifestyles of the 1960's are still alive and well. He is assigned along with Mrs. Kensington's daughter, Vanessa, and must work together to stop Dr. Evil, who is also played by Mike Myers. Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery is a spy spoof which delivers many jokes and laughs and includes cameos from many including Carrie Fisher and Will Ferrell.Actors Let's start with the lead actor, Mike Myers. He being a Canadian born actor plays an English spy, and it's as convincing as it can be. His classic English accent is spot on and makes it seems as he has always been an English citizen. His costumes are amazing, and really stand out, especially in the scene where he is playing in a casino. Myers also plays the villain, Dr. Evil. You really have to study him, to see Myers behind the makeup. Although they are both played by the same actor, Austin Powers and Dr. Evil are two very different characters. All the other character are amazingly real, and although they mirror certain spy characters from other films, there are no direct copy of the character, such as Random Task. He is an obvious spoof of Odd Job from Goldfinger, but has a different personality than him. Elizabeth Hurley plays a wonderful 'Powers Girl' and the cameos are welcoming as they are not just cameos, but also fit in as part of the story. Will Ferrell is wonderful as Mustafa.Music The music in this film is very different to what you will find in modern films today. Like the films which are a parody of the old classic films, the soundtrack is identical to the type of music you find in a 60's film. George S. Clinton teams up with Burt Bacharach to bring a soundtrack very similar to the original Casino Royale spoof. Its theme is catchy and has become recognisable all over.Special Effects This is a film which is not particularly known for its special effects. There are some CGI (computer generate imagery) used, but this is very little. If you've seen many of the earlier James Bond films, you will understand how the special effects are used in this. There are many explosions during the confrontation, with stunt men bouncing over the rails. This is not bad though, and adds the feel of the film. The background used when Austin Powers is in the car are even similar to the early film. Watch an old film and you will notice how obvious the background image looks during shots inside are car. This is used here and can be hilarious to those who are aware of it.Conclusion Overall, 'Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery' is a hilarious film and different to a lot of movie spoofs we are encountering these days. It might not be for everyone, and you would find it a lot funnier if you have great knowledge of the spy genre, so you should brush up on your films if you're planning to watch this. As Austin would say, this film is simply shagtastic.""Ooo, Behave!""  Austin Powers (Mike Myers)",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

Austin was a swinging international spy for British intelligence (?) in the 1960s. He was cryogenically frozen along with his archenemy, Dr. Evil (also Myers). After 30 years, Powers is thawed, and he's in for a few '90s surprises. Stewardesses are now flight attendants. Carnaby Street is no longer the center of the world. Dancing has gone way beyond the Frug, the Jerk and the Monkey. Crushed velvet is a fashion ""don't,"" and free love costs a lot.
A somewhat shell-shocked Austin quickly teams up with Vanessa (Elizabeth Hurley), the daughter of his former Mrs. Peel-like sidekick, Mrs. Kensington. Meanwhile, Dr. Evil is having problems at home. He has a test-tube slacker son, Scott Evil, who can't relate to Daddy's desire for world domination. Myers is a total delight no matter which part he's tour-de-forcing. Hurley appears game, but doesn't seem to possess a natural flair for comedy. Robert Wagner, Carrie Fisher, Mimi Rogers and Burt Bacharach make cameos.

105,willcundallreview,A 90's iconic comedy,7,24 February 2014,"Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery the first in the Austin Powers series, is a just about good film and make's for a comedy with all the trademarks you can expect from such a film. Quite funny and give's off some good laughs for you, but also provides a fairly good spy film as well just like a James Bond but with much funnier humour than even Roger Moore. I'll tell below why I think it is a good film.The story is solid and as I said a good spy film and with Dr Evil being one of the most famous and most funny villains in film, you can't help just feel good whilst watching it. The film has a slow start but get's into it quick enough and Powers is humorous throughout but it really is Dr Evil who steals the humour off him in this first instalment. Finally on the story it is actually a good Sci-Fi too which blends in well with the comedy and crime and also makes for some crazy sequences.I do like Mike Myers in this film but I felt he failed slightly at playing Austin Powers as his other portrayal of Dr Evil is much funnier and basically rules he comedy in this piece. Liz Hurley is a good performance as Power's agent helper and she guides the more serious side of agents which is then lampooned by Austin. Finally One great comedy part of this is with Dr Evil's table of evil people, and his son Scott who is just brilliant(Seth Green portraying) and the only person who isn't frightened of Dr Evil and constantly complains about little things.I think the set's and gadgets etc used are great because they optimise what James Bond uses but completely humour's them and makes for some funny joke set up's. It is well written comedy wise by Mike Myers who serve's as the main actor, producer and writer and he put's together a film that he truly owns, it also makes you want to see what he could write for the next instalments and that would test his skill that is seen in this film.The film can be unfunny and not that I think everyone will hate the jokes but some jokes just miss the mark and become just to crude, slightly less crude and this film could have been massively better but it is still a good comedy all around. I think also that the story is obviously not the strongest ever but what do you expect with a comedy, and don't think this film isn't funny because people say it isn't, just watch it first.I recommend it for anyone who enjoys a good and crude comedy that can be tasteless at times but manages enough class to be funny but also sophisticated in it's jokes. If you don't enjoy a lot of sexual humour then this isn't for you as Powers is a sex addicted man from the 60's who tries it on with any female he see's it seems but though it isn't serious perverseness he is obviously making himself look stupid to make you laugh.Overall a just about good film, it only just scrapes out being good rather than just fairly good but I think many will agree with me, although some will be disappointed with this film as well so I expect mixed reviews from most who see it.

112,troyputland,A love or hate comedy,8,30 April 2015,"Mike Myers is the chalk to your cheese, the salt to your sweet. He can improve a mix, or outright destroy it. He's exploited James Bond's core attributes, ruining the stereotypes and the clichés we've grown use to, and come up with not one, but two egotistical maniacs that allow him to rein free and pretty much do as he pleases. The humour falls in to the slapstick category, and sometimes it scrapes the bottom of the comedy gene pool. It's clearly not for everyone. For every comedy gold there's a rusty, wooden pun. Austin Powers (Myers) is an English secret agent from the 60's whose charm, wit and stupidity gets him along in life. His evil nemesis, the aptly named Dr. Evil (also Myers), freezes himself in space and reappears 30 years later in the 90's. Powers follows in pursuit to once and for all bring Dr. Evil down. This crazy plot works because both hero and villain are out of their depth after missing so much from the last 3 decades. Dr. Evil threatens to destroy the world unless he receives $1m from the United Nations, and Austin realises he cannot sow his seed like he use to, thanks to a strong willed, sexy Elizabeth Hurley.

115,ReelCheese,Enough Hits To Be Fun,7,24 June 2006,"A generally hit-and-miss effort with enough hits to be fun. Mike Myers stars as the title character, a groovy 1960s spy who, after decades of being cryogenically frozen, is unthawed in modern times to thwart his old nemesis, Dr. Evil (also played by Myers). Along the way, the film takes plenty of pokes at pop culture, both past and present, and features no shortage of sex jokes.But the best moments come when the film takes aim at spy movies, particularly the earlier entries in the James Bond series. One henchman, for instance, throws his shoe at people when a pistol would obviously be more practical. There's also a memorable moment when our hero is finally captured. Rather than simply shooting him, Dr. Evil places him in an elaborate device that slowly lowers him into a pool of hungry alligators. Of course Dr. Evil (the best character in the movie) has better things to do than ensure the plot goes according to plan, and Austin escapes certain death. Scenes like that help make the movie fun even when it isn't particularly funny.""Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery"" was not a huge box office success, but it built up a solid reputation on video. That spurred two (to date) highly-successful sequels, which squeezed whatever was left of the concept - and then some. If you still haven't seen the original, it's worth a look. Despite its silliness, there is a decent comedy here.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

The life collides of course with a bang, and a number of laughs. It's not much of a story, but does it have to have a great story? I mean, come on, this is just a anti-serious, plumped up and quite silly little movie with no need to be well made.

118,AndreiPavlov,What this movie (as well as its sequel) needs is a good cutting,4,11 February 2008,"Being not a very bad movie it lacks decency badly. ""Gaudy trash"" are the best words to describe this fest of ""hits and misses"". The movie gets from vulgar and embarrassing to quite funny and cute. What this movie (as well as its sequel) needs is a good cutting. If you cut all the bad and vulgar things out of the film and leave everything genuinely funny, you can get a very bright example of modern comedy. Unfortunately it has more misses than hits. Therefore only 4 out of 10 and I am very sad that such a brilliant concept and such a bright film went many wrong ways and made too many wrong turns.I don't think that I should name all the misses, do I. Maybe just one or two, or three for you just to understand what I mean. Dr Evil's speech during a kind of ""psychological father-son rehabilitation seminar"" is not funny but vulgar. All the fuss with the ""Swedish gadget"" is very annoying. The ways the evil characters are killed off leaves much to be desired: they don't have a chance to show off (it looks as if the filmmakers were short of ideas). The evil female character disappears without any noticeable performance, and so on and so forth.If it were only 50 minutes long but with the best excerpts included, it would be a very well made comedy.Mr Michael Myers, if you read this, take note that you do have talent but there is great responsibility for every talented comedian to put it right. If you make a comedy, you should make it in such a way that every child and adult could enjoy it without getting embarrassed and annoyed. Adult sexual humour often kills even smartest comedies while the permanent classics of Mr Charles Chaplin, Mr Buster Keaton, and Mr Norman Wisdom will remain immortal Art of comedy genre. Did these masters ever get vulgar in their classics? You know the answer.4 out of 10 with a sigh. Thanks for attention.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

The movie is about Austin Powers who is frozen in the year 1967 and unfrozen in 1997 to save the world from the evil Doctor Evil. The movie is very funny and is the perfect spoof to all action movies(particularly James Bond movies) as it has lots of the aspects that James Bond movies do(for example the cards,babes and all that). I have never met a person who does not like this movie and I have met quite a few people that have seen it.

All the best known James Bond are spoofed here pretty well and it's not some kind of a cheap parody. It's also in my opinion the best Austin Powers film, though it's sequels where made on a bigger budget, but still this film was the funniest. What else did I like was the atmosphere of the 60's in this film. The idea of hippie being a spy is quite an original idea. I think this movie is more Sean Connery's Bond films parody, because even most of the bad guys were from Sean Connery's Bond movies like from Goldfinger or Thunderball, though I noticed that one scene was a spoof of Live and Let Die with Roger Moore.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

I knew the character and seen pictures and references through the years but for one or another reason I never got to watch Austin Powers's movies.
Started silly and bizarre, but thinking it was just that scene I kept watching to...
See when it was going to stop with that corny, cheap choreography
See when it would stop the overacted, rude and disgusting attitude of the character.
See when ONE clever joke would come up
Never did!! it was all the same, no attitude adjustment, no nothing, che character is disgusting and praised for being like that from the beginning to the end.
It's misogynist, unfunny, gross and stupid.
Don't get me wrong, I get this kind of characters in other movies, but there's always a balance, it has to be. I'm not taking this too seriously, on the contrary, I couldn't take it as a joke because it was not fun!
How has this movie become a classic? Never seen it before, and I honestly regret I spent almost one hour watching, I couldn't even stand it, so I fast forwarded and only seen more of the same rubbish.
Poor cinematography, lame writing, terrible directing and pathetic acting.
And worst of all, and shame on a comedy, very, very unfunny.
One of the worst movies I've (tried to) watch in my life.

123,ryan_kuhn,Fresh Look At British Intelligence,7,13 February 2005,"For those of us who are too young to have experienced most of the James Bond movies, we've had to look to other British spies to grow up with. The British spy of our generation is the brain child of Saturday Night Live alum Mike Myers in the form of Austin Powers, who makes his debut in this film, Internation Man of Mystery. While recycling jokes and characters from the James Bond movie, there is a certain freshness to the spy, as he is a 60s swinger trying to make it in the politically correct days of the late 90s. Powers is brought out of cryogenic freezing in 1997 to take on his arch-enemy, Dr. Evil (also played by Myers), who himself is returning to Earth after 30 years and has trouble adapting to the new world. The best jokes come from Powers and Dr. Evil trying to catch up on the time they've missed, trying to use today's technology, and adjust for inflation of the dollar. One million dollars does not go as far as it used to, much to Dr. Evil's surprise. The Bond references are funny too, but the part I like best about this movie is how characters had to adapt to 30 years of civilization change.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

I didn't give it a 5 or a 4 only because it was unique and had a big heart. As to laughs, it was a 5 or a 4 - no better..I realize the big majority of voters gave it a higher rating, but at one time the human race believed the earth to be flat.

Doctor Evil sums this movie up perfectly when he tell his son Scott ""You just don't get it, do you?"" That's right Doc, I've no idea why I didn't go and bang my head against a wall rather than carry on watching ""Austin Powers"".I sat through this film stony-faced, cringing inwardly at the obvious sexual innuendos, crude jokes about bodily functions and the looks of discomfort on some well-respected actors' faces.Taking what is essentially a James Bond plot and tacking on a lot of gags has been done before, in the original ""Casino Royale"" and ""Carry On Spying"". Neither of those films made me laugh much either.I enjoyed the daft 60s musical number where Austin parades through a Hollywood version of Swinging London, but there's about an hour and a half of celluloid gackass tacked onto it that I'd rather forget about.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

He repulsive to look at, doesn't have a hunky body, he way to horny and has terrible teeth. But he still contains that one special element that all special agents have and that's charm. Mike Myers is perfect as Austin Powers and let not forget Dr Evil.

A delightful spoof of the James Bond films and similar spy movies, Austin Powers is a top agent of the British Secret Service in the late 1960s, and also a world renowned fashion photographer, swinger and sex icon. When his nemesis Dr. Evil freezes himself and is shot into space, Austin also freezes himself to fight him again should he return. Both of them are thawed out in 1997, picking up where they left off, but both considerably out of place coping with the strange new world of the late nineties, with many hilarious consequences. Free love and carefree experimenting with mind expanding drugs are out of the question for Austin despite working with gorgeous female agent Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley), while Dr. Evil has a hard time wrapping his mind around the fact that one million dollars just isn't enough money to ask for ransom any more, plus he also has to deal with his son Scott Evil (Seth Green) who was artificially created in his absence. Overall, Austin is funny, but it's Dr. Evil who gets all the really good jokes: since Mike Myers performs both characters, he gets out on top of both. The movie failed at the box office though, but turned out a surprise hit in video stores to such an extent, it nevertheless spawned two sequels, both of them good for a decent laugh but not nearly as much as this one.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

The only problem with them is that in order to get real laughs, you have to be in a silly mood. If you're not in a silly mood, then you probably won't think it is anything funny. Most of the people who said this had no humor probably watched it when they weren't in that mood.There are several good things about this movie. Such as the way it spoofs 007, and other spy movies of the '60's. The beginning of this movie takes place during the '60's, but then it jumps ahead to the late '90's. This movie mixes the culture of the '60's into the '90's, and does it very well.There is a lot of sexual humor in this movie, but anyone who is in elementary school probably won't pick up on any of it.In many ways, this is just as good as the sequels, but in many ways I prefer the sequels. It probably has something to do with how the sequels have more characters, and in many ways better humor.

Just then there was a woman so Austin Powers Punch's the woman and then sees a man in disguise from Dr. Evil just then he use a gun to shoot with a dart and it killed him so Dr. Evil escape from the Pussy Cat swingers club he was in a flying Big Boy. So just then Austin Powers was frozen in 1960s and defrosted in the 1990 to defeat Dr. Evil. There are more parts in this movie so you can watch the rest of the movie to see what happens.

140,Don-102,"Groovy stuff, but this is Dr. Evil's shag machine, baby....",8,13 March 1999,"Mike Myers undoubtedly has great comedic talent, but sometimes it wears thin, especially in the WAYNE'S WORLD movies.  This time, he takes on the swinging 60's mod scene, as well as early James Bond.  Everyone knows the basic gimmick, freezing the shag-hero until 1997 so he can take on the evil Dr. Evil (also Myers).  The world has changed: no free love, no more-mind freeing drugs.  Some people have talked about the picture as ""slapstick"" with a message.  The Austin Powers character must adapt to the drastic change and un-idealistic 90's.  The thing is, Austin Powers is not all that funny (except the rotting teeth and hilarious shagadelic dance). Dr. Evil is the one to watch.If you are not familiar with Mod, or any Bond movies, you may find yourself turning this flick off.  Most of the jokes are inside ones with these topics in mind.  However, the Dr. Evil character has you laughing all the way to the end.  It is truly funny seeing an arch-criminal going to family therapy with his son.  He tells the group his son is ""quite astute"", and not easliy killed.  Evil steals the movie by partaking in every cliche the spy genre is comprised of and his cat, Mr. Bigglesworth, is the most important thing to him besides world domination.There are some great sight gags, especially when Austin and the beautiful Elizabeth Hurley strut around naked.  With careful choreography, their privates are never exposed.  Again, while Powers shags on, baby, you have to say this is Dr. Evil's film.  No doubt he and Mr. Bigglesworth will be back for the sequel, and perhaps his son has started that evil petting zoo.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
141,moviemattb,A pretty funny spoof of the spy genre,9,26 May 2014,"""Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery"" is a pretty funny spoof of the spy genre, especially making fun of the James Bond movies. I did thought this movie was hilariously funny, when I was young back then. Now by looking back at it, it was not as hilariously funny as I remember. Don't get me wrong I still think that this is a funny movie, but it wasn't as hilariously funny as I remember. When you have some dirty jokes in the movie like having our two lead actors getting naked, it just depends on whether is funny or not; at times it can be funny, and at times it can't. I just only wish if the jokes where funny if they would make me laugh the most. Nevertheless, the movie is still funny. Aside from the humor, some of the CG effects of the Big Boy weren't that good either, but it does not take me out of the movie as I am enjoying it. So those are the only parts where I have issues with, but they are not really a big deal. I thought Mike Myers has done a great job for not only writing the script, but playing two parts in the movie. Elizabeth Hurley is absolutely stunning in the movie, and she does manage to take on the role pretty well. The action scenes were done fine, but nothing spectacular about it. You do get some nice cameos like Will Ferrell, Tom Arnold, and such. The movie does hold up really well, but the jokes and the CG effects of the Big Boy could have been better.

142,thespeos,"Funny, But too Self-Engrossed",7,6 June 2021,"The premise of this film is solid - spoof 007 for all it's male narcissism, male sexual promiscuity, and stupid cliches. I thought the idea potentially fun, and Mike Myers was a guy to lead it.Overall, the fact that this movie isn't a dud and failure is itself a success. Normally, when a film's lead actor is also the primary (or sole) writer then you often have a (somewhat) myopic story. Sadly, that seems to be the case here.In the pursuit of avoiding many of the diseases that 007 and spy films (in general) have, this film cranks out the same drone. It's not that there aren't clever and funny moments , but the film constantly pauses and becomes wrapped up in itself (or Myers). This reminds a bit of Eddie Murphy's ""The Nutty Professor"" with so much emphasis on his comedic skill that the film can't breathe.STORY: Again, the story has potential, but gets mired in Myers' (or director's) handling of spoofs - he gets wrapped up in his own skits. If he'd removed himself from more, he'd have a better story, but as is, it's like he's doing a cultural diatribe. Frankly, Peter Sellers does a magnificently better job in the ""Pink Panther"" series from the 1960's and 1970's,ACTING: As expected, the acting is very good. Robert Wagner was a poor choice for ""#2"" as he appears almost disinterested in his role (or he had trouble not laughing).Though Myers is gifted, no one stands out.TEMPO: Start, stop, start, stop ... the whole way through.CINEMATOGRAPHY: This is the best part of the film (aside from some of Myers' antics), with lots of color, music, and ideas that flash and spark.DIRECTING: This was only the director's 2nd film (1st bombed) but went on to direct the ""Meet the Parents"" series, and later focused on made-for-TV drivel. Overall he did a good job here, but obviously he's more comfortable in a more controlled environment like TV.Summary: The film is very well acted, has some funny spoofing, and is pretty to watch. Unfortunately, it weighs on itself, and becomes constipated with self-obsession.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

Just watch the trailer from the film and you'll pretty much get the idea for what to expect, if you like the look of the trailer then this film will definitely keep you entertained but if you come in expecting to get more from it you'll likely be disappointed.

Reality and sensibility are totally suspended, and it becomes pure entertainment and real fun. I will not generally go in for bad language or obscenity....but what there is of these in the Austin Powers films is done in such a deliberately comedic way that I find it easy to force myself to overlook it in most instances. One thing that is not forced is these films is the humor. The situations and the characters are truly funny, and I have found myself viewing this film repeatedly. Culturally literate baby-boomers who were around in these days will get a big kick out of it. I do not recommend this for children---but they probably will watch it anyway--just hope there's some adult supervision there to explain to them what was happening, and to help them along with the terminology and the groups of the era.

It was extremely well marketed to make everyone think they have to see it and have to like it.
The main premise is to make anything that is cool seem uncool.  Otherwise to keep telling us that James Bond or Flint were unrealistic just does not make me laugh.  In fact in a sense every film is unrealistic the moment we walk in a theater we see a screen we know it is not real.  Imagination is needed to enjoy most any film.

In contrast, the British colleagues of Austin and Vanessa are displayed more straight like Basil Exposition (played by Michael York) and Mrs. Kensington (played by Mimi Rogers), along with U$ Commander Gilmour (played by Charles Napier), Russian General Borschevsky (played by Elya Baskin). In some ways you could say this film is a pro-British film in that it displays England positively and without any social commentary at all!In other ways, the film is crude with jokes like one character named ""Johnson"" and another as ""Alotta Fagina."" There are also more sex jokes than you can count, but that is common throughout all the movies. In another way, while Austin is basically a transplant from the 1960s who has arrived in the 1990s and is a bit out of place, the 1960s is showed relatively positively, almost in some ways glorifying it. This stands in contrast with films like The Omega Man (a bit), Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas and Inherent Vice. The contrast between Austin's ""shagging""/swinging ideals, where is seemingly a bit sexist, and the present is a common theme, so much so that the villains create fembots (all played by Cindy Margolis) to try and ""best"" Austin, although this doesn't work. This also comes up in a scene between Dr. Evil and Austin, with Dr. Evil saying that ""freedom failed"" and Austin claiming there is now ""freedom with responsibility"" which Dr. Evil calls the attitude of an ""aging hipster."" Additionally, Vanessa challenges Austin after he admits he ""shagged"" Alotta Fagina and without protection (he says that condoms are only for sailors), pressuring him to become a ""one-woman man"" in Austin's words.There is one scene at the beginning which has always caught my interest. Austin has gone through the unfreezing process and when he is introduced to the U.S. and Russian general, he says the Russian general working with them is ""mad"" (an anti-communist belief), then Basil explains that the Cold War is over. He says that he hopes the capitalists paid for their crimes and lost, an interesting sentiment, while Basil tells him that ""we"" (meaning the West) won. Then nothing more is said about this, with the movie discarding this thinking as he re-integrates into capitalist society as a ""star."" I'm not sure if this is a stereotype of the countercultural movement or what, but it is actually one of my favorite scenes of the movie.With that, I feel this movie deserves a rating of 8 out of 10, although it is firmly a 1990s film.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

150,Cephyran,"Cool, campy, funny...",8,4 October 2004,"By far, this is easily the best of the three Austin Powers movies. It has no precedent, so it's standard of humor was what to expect, rather than what to live up to, and it was a unique, dynamic humorous take on the genre. the sequels fed off the success of this one, so they lack in certain places where this one excels, especially with originality. Mike Myers is ever the funnyman, playing on rarely but occasionally witty humor, and mostly pandering to the 13 year old boy audience with the crude humor. The vulgarities will be perceived by some people as inappropriate, but you still have to remember - it's intended for kids around 13. And, if it's a rainy Friday night, you'll watch it and you'll find it's funny, even if it offends you. There is one big element of the humor, and that is that it's not really timeless humor. Thus, I find I often have to put at least a few months between each time I watch a Mike Myers or Jim Carrey movie.But, Austin Powers is cool, campy, and funny.

Wayne's World was good, but pales in comparison to this shagadelic flick. It pays homage to the 60's and James Bond Movies with a wink rather than a stab. Yes, it's overblown, and yes parts are ridiculous, but that is part of the fun. The opening sequence and titles made me cry I was laughing so hard. I think some of the ones who don't like the flick may not pick up on a lot of the references to other films or fads. Can't wait for the sequel - it's in the top three of my summer must see's, behind Episode One and Eyes Wide Shut.

Mike Myer's effort in this film was outstanding, he played 2 characters, wrote the script and basically directed the movie.

One of my favorite things about this movie and all of the Austin powers movies is the Burt Bacharach songs. So cool.
i like the colorful sets that remind me of the 1960's.I think Mike Myers is good as Dr. Evil and Austin powers. And Elizabeth Hurley is does a good acting job as his partner. I think the whole cast does a good job.The funniest scene in the movie for me is the scene in the Los Vegas Casino. Austin Powers is in one stall and Toma Arnold's character is in another stall. One of doctor evils henchmen tries to kill Austin powers. Austin powers is making a lot of noise and Tom Arnold's character does not know what is going and thinks the Noises that Austin is making has to do with something else.Even though Austin powers is supposed to be a comedy it does not make me laugh very much.

157,sethmlanders,James Bond with Bad Teeth and an Out-Of-Control Mojo!,9,6 September 2014,"This was an enjoyable experience. Mike Myers found a way to take a well-known spy icon and make him feeble-minded yet at the same time, gain our affection for him from start to finish. A very smart and original idea that would have backfired if the material was handed to someone else. The movie follows Austin Powers frozen from the 60s and thawed to resume his life in the contemporary 90s.Elizabeth Hurley joins him as the sexy sidekick and together, they must stop Dr. Evil from taking over the world through power & extortion. Austin has to save the day while trying to blend into the modern world. There are plenty of great laughs and pop culture references that are similar to what Myers did in Wayne's World. Here, the jokes are fresh and the character is so memorable, even though he has his flaws.I can safely say that this is the best in the series yet. The other two sequels aren't as good, but they're all still a bunch of fun to watch. This was the era when Mike Myers was truly in the strongest position of his career. Before you see the other two, give this one a watch and have a few laughs with some friends!",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
158,punctate,groovy,9,11 October 1999,"The best spoof movie since The Naked Gun. Austin Powers played by Mike Myers is unfrozen to face his archenemy Dr. Evil also played by Mike Myers. The concept of someone from the 60's being brought into the 90's isn't original. The Brady Bunch used this idea first but that movie gave us a new definition of corny. The 60's was very much an age of change and social revolution making the time period easy to pick on. The James Bond movie Austin Powers spoofs the most is Gold Finger the second movie in the Bond series. Mike Myers knows well what can make people and what will become popular. The movie's 60's dialogue will catch on with the teen generation. The movie is clever and hilarious even more then once. The bottom line is the movie is fun, funny and totally groovy baby.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
159,james362001,"""Does It Make You Horny?""",9,1 February 2002,"Allow me to be honest.  When I first saw the previews of Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery (1997), the preview gave me the impression that this film was low-budget and made in England.  I had no interest in seeing this film.  It wasn't until the sequel Austin Powers: The Man Who Shagged Me(1999) was released and Verne Troyer was on a talk show talking about the film and they had more teasing film clips of Austin Powers: The Man Who Shagged Me, that I decided I must see the first film first.  So at the library I rented for free Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery and here are my thoughts.                                                  First of all, Mike Myers as Austin Powers with bad yellow stained, crooked, buck teeth was not appealing to me at all.  However since I am writing this review on February 2002, I can say I have fallen in love (sort of speak) with the character Mike Myers has created.                           Austin Powers is clearly a movie for ADULTS ONLY. The sexual situation and sexual innuendoes are really funny.  One of the funniest bits was when Austin Powers was walking around full frontal nude (implied) and strategically placed objects obstructed the voyeuristic view for the audience.  The FemBots walking to the Nancy Sinatra tune ""These Boots Were Made For Walkin'"" was a hoot and the FemBot with the guns extending out of the bra cups was funny too.  In case you haven't figured it out by now, this film is a spoof of those ""In Like Flint"" films, 007 James Bond films, and a Vincent Price film that comes to mind.  Nothing wrong with that.  All movies come from an idea and ideas come from anywhere.  The ensembled cast is the funniest I have seen in years.  Elizabeth Hurley as Miss Kensington, the no-sex-on-the-job sidekick is wonderful in her role. Very professional and good acting.  Robert Wagner is likeable in every role we see him in, even if he plays a bad guy. In this role he brings his charm, debonair and wit. Mindy Sterling as ""Frau Farbissina"" is very fun to watch. Her delivery and comedic talent is brilliant.  I wish their were more scenes of her.                  I throughly enjoy the 1960's flavor of the film.  The music, the flowers (flower power), the fashion, the psychedelic colors, those little ""Laugh-In""-like spots, Burt Bacharach ""The Look Of Love"", the models and mostly the spy spoof of it all.  And I especially like the jokes that are personal to men only.  Those kind of jokes and gags that only men would understand. The song ""BBC"" that Mike Myers wrote and performed in the end credits is a real catchy tune.  I like it.  Mike Myers has written a genius story and I am glad it was made into a motion picture.                                                 If you are feeling depressed, this film might be therapeutic to you.  I enjoyed it and had many laughs.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
160,Xophianic,Destined to become a classic!,8,12 February 2000,"When I first saw this movie advertised, I had no interest whatsoever in seeing it. I was a Mike Myers fan, but AUSTIN POWERS: INTERNATIONAL MAN OF MYSTERY looked like the stupidest and least creative movie of the year. But after hearing of a few of the hilarious scenes of the movie, I decided to test my faith in Myers and give it a try. It turned out to be one of the funniest movies I'd seen in a long time.The swinging hipster from the 60's, Austin Powers (Mike Myers), puts himself in deep freeze for thirty years to pursue his archenemy, Dr. Evil (Mike Myers). He is thawed out in the 90's when Dr. Evil finally reappears and plans to drill a missile to the center of the earth and destroy the planet core, and then the world. Austin Powers, with the help of his true love Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley), must find a way to stop Dr. Evil and shag Vanessa. But Dr. Evil has some very dangerous customers working for him, such as Number Two (Robert Wagner), Frau Farbissina (Mindy Sterling), Mustafa (Will Ferrell) and his son Scott Evil (Seth Green) who thinks his father should just kill Austin rather than make a complicated plan to get rid of him.The plot of this movie is a big spoof of movies such as the JAMES BOND films, so it's not expected to be anything but funny, which it certainly is. Don't listen to people who say this is for middle-school kids, people of all ages can enjoy this movie. It should also be said that Dr. Evil is a terrific character because, in addition to being very funny, is the stereotype spy-movie bad guy.The acting in this movie is pretty good. Mike Myers plays both Austin Power and Dr. Evil, two very different characters, very well. Elizabeth Hurley does a very good job as Austin's girlfriend. Both Seth Green, who I think has a long, successful career ahead of him, and Mindy Sterling are very funny. Robert Wagner and Michael York, two Hollywood veterans, do good jobs with the small parts they have. Will Farrell is underplayed in this movie, but it very funny in the scene he is in. The Fembots, by the way, are terrific.This movie is destined to become a movie classic, and ""Yeah baby!"" will be a catch phrase that will be remembered years from now. Austin Power and Dr. Evil are both stereotype symbols of past movies. Basically, these two guys are symbols of American film, at least for that particular genre. Don't expect much out of this movie except for a good laugh and a good time and you won't be disappointed.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
161,ToldYaSo,Austin Powers shined far brighter before his Mojo was stolen,8,16 August 1999,"Mike Myers created a memorable, hilarious character for the first ""Austin Powers"" film for a number of reasons. One was a tribute to his late father, a memorabilia of things that his father loved. Secondly, and to be sure I'm presuming here, for the rich, ample supply of great comic material. The idea of a sexually liberated 60s swinger adjusting to the more reserved 90s is quite amusing and what chiefly drew me in.When I saw ""Austin Powers: International Man Of Mystery"" in theaters, I thought it was fantastic fun. I also found myself having to defend the film as many nay-sayers proclaimed the film moronic and lame. Many of said individuals would also recite memorable dialogue as though it was their favourite film at a later date. I also feel that the opening dance sequence was worth the price of admission alone. Soon enough, most people came round.The ""Austin Powers"" DVD is also quite an impressive example of the benefits of the new medium. Whenever I wish to show off the features of a DVD player to the uninitiated, I usually pop in Austin. It has everything from an audio commentary to deleted scenes and much more. And with repeated viewings, I can safely proclaim that yes, the humour is quite base at times, but it is fun, and after frequent showings, most of the scenes still have me laughing.Suffice it to say, I'm a fan. That is why it was so disappointing to take in the sequel to this fine satire. Going in to a sequel, your expectations are (usually) lowered. I had heard talk of a sequel not long after the first offering had completed it's run, and I'll admit that even then, I was dubious of their chances to recapture the same magic of the first film. In this case, I had been assured by a couple of people that it was good, and the trailer preview looked promising. I couldn't believe how much regurgitation was going on. But more importantly than that, the comic timing was way off. Every so-called punch line felt like a simple warm-up to a bigger punch that never came. An inappropriately long pause after each ""joke"" only drew more attention to it's ineffectiveness and lack of uniqueness. I hate to say it, but it seems as though the filmmakers weren't sure what made the first one popular, and kind of missed it on this second go.To be sure, there were enjoyable moments, but it seemed as though everything was off kilter. The story line which interested me enough to see it, involves time traveling back to the 60s to retrieve Austin's stolen ""Mojo"". But this comic potential opportunity was passed up. It seems they could've come up with a lot more comic material on that angle, but didn't bother to explore it. And as silly as the story was, the pace of the whole film seemed transparently formulaic. Like a shopping list of what was popular in the first film, thrown in to the bag without much consideration for originality or appropriate placement.I'll admit that part of my experience for the sequel was hampered by a pack of sixteen year old girls who laughed maybe a little too much at the ultra-mildly amusing bits to the point of annoyance. But I can't say  they bothered me too much, I was literally tempted to walk out on it, but I suspect Heather Graham's ""Felicity Shagwell"" stopped me. Quite ironically, Austin's quest to recover his ""Mojo"" mirrors the effort to recapture the magic of the first installment, and sadly fails. I sincerely hope it won't taint my affinity for the first film next time I watch it.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

166,MinorityReporter,Pretty funny - Mike Myers is great!,7,24 September 2005,"The first time I saw Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery I was actually disappointed. I hadn't seen many of the Bond films at that time so I really didn't get that many of the jokes. Some time ago I bought the DVD don't ask me why but I did and being older and having seen quite a few of the Bond films I really grew to appreciate the humor and the general mood of the film. Mike Myers is undoubtedly the best man who could ever spoof James Bond because he is pretty much the complete opposite of Bond. He is unattractive (especially with the fake teeth he uses in this film) and he doesn't come off as being sophisticated or any good in a fight so for him to play an irresistible swinger is immensely funny in itself.Mike Myers does a good job with the character(s) and brings a certain charm to both Austin Powers and Doctor Evil. It is obvious that Myers is inspired by Peter Sellers in the fact that he plays more than one character (something he will bring even further in the following films) and he does a very good job. He also pulls off a semi-believable British accent giving the character of Austin Powers an extra level of credibility. Austin Powers is the most interesting character in the film and his chemistry with Vanessa Kensington (Elizabeth Hurley) Makes their scenes together the most interesting and funny in the film. Doctor Evil is funny the first time but quite frankly isn't as interesting as Powers making his scenes less reviewable. Elizabeth Hurley is hot and thus works great as a love interest for Austin. She is the best of Austin's girls in any of the films. The supporting cast is decent as well. Michael York, Robert Wagner and Mindy Sterling all do great jobs.There are a lot of references and spoofs of the original Bond films that work great. A few examples are a Chinese henchman called Random Task an obvious reference to the greatest of the Bond films where there was a similar Chinese henchman called Oddjob, a woman called Alotta Fagina referencing the fact that many Bond girls had names you could read differently. Dr. Evil looks a lot like Ernst Stavro Blofeld the only recurring super villain of the Bond films as we saw him in You Only Live Twice (I wouldn't call Jaws a super villain as he is a henchman).The film is, however, lacking an interesting story. There is a story but it isn't that interesting. I found the story in the second film to be much more original and fresh and this drags down a bit. It doesn't change the fact that Austin Powers is a funny film that deserves at least one viewing.All in all 6/10",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

What kind of spy, an International Man Of Mystery. Hey, doesn't that sound a little like the title of a James Bond movie? Well, yes in fact it's a spoof of the spy genre and yes the sensational 60s. Myers plays Austin Powers and his arch-evil nemesis Dr. Evil, two different men, Austin wants to save the world, while Dr. Evil would rather destroy it. Seth Green plays Dr. Evil's son Scott Evil, who was artificially inseminated, and he doesn't want anything to do with taking over the world, will his dad convince him otherwise? This movie is great, one of the things that makes it that way, is because it's got a great story, funny memorable characters, a hero who has yellow teeth (and he's stuck in the 60s), a woman side-kick, an evil villain, and some action. The only thing that might turn people off of this movie is the raunchy humor.Me, I thought it was very funny, enjoyable, and it's definitely my favourite Mike Myers movie.

Most of my colleagues here still say, 'Oh, behave,' 'My name is Richie Cunningham, and this is my wife, Oprah,' and 'Yeah, baby!' close to 18 months after the film showed.Myers is fabulous and Robert Wagner gives one of his most enjoyable performances. Elizabeth Hurley is only so-so when you compare her performances in dramatic films and TV, but what a tiny (and nearly inconsequential) complaint!My only complaint was the release date here in New Zealand.

Each joke is cleverly displayed, so as to not completely turn the audience off.However, I must note that although this film received a PG-13 rating, it does mess around with that fine line that separates PG-13 from R.  So parents, this is probably not the wisest choice for family night.Disregarding that, this movie is fun and colorful and thus rates a 7/10.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
175,MyDarkStar,Truly original,10,17 March 2002,"This movie totally caught me off guard when I first saw it. I didn't expect it to have the wit or originality that it truly possesses. For some reason, the previews to this movie completely turned me off, and I dismissed it as mindless humor....but then I actually saw the movie. If you walk away from seeing ""Austin Powers : International Man Of Mystery"" thinking it had ""childish humor"", then you didn't catch the truly funny aspects of the film. Sometimes the best parts are the small discreet things that a character does/says.That's because ""Austin Powers"" essentially is a joke in itself. It is a joke inside of a joke. When I look at the grand perspective of it these days, I think it came just one step away from actually inventing a new ""genre"" of film. There are some other movies that, when you really think about it, kinda make a nod towards ""Austin Powers"" with their tongue-in-cheek humor.To start to name funny moments in this film would be an insult to the movie, since it is just filled with them throughout. Mike Myers did a fantastic job inventing this whole world that Austin Powers and Dr. Evil exist. The plot itself is beautifully outrageous.A truly breakthrough comedy in its own right - don't judge it on the very disappointing sequels.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
176,chrisjgray2000,Fun,9,8 July 2002,After Wayne's World Myke Myers has made a comeback with a swinging spy called Austin Powers. Austin Powers has had himself frozen since 1967 so that if his nemises Dr. Evil returns to Earth he can be called upon to do battle with the mastermind.It's a fun James Bond spoof with Myke Myers playing both the title role and the bad guy. Although the film is to make Austin the star of the show it's actually Dr. Evil that is funnier with his brilliant phrases such as when he explains who his parents are. The fun doesn't even stop there. Of course there are some faults and the film does wear some of the jokes thin but it doesn't stop Austin and the other weird and wonderful characters from making the whole thing a funny romp. ****,Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

Rather than hearing it from a person who prefers to slash his wrists for playing the Bond, I would prefer watching this trilogy.The plot of the first film is inspired from the Bond movies of the past is a enjoyable flick and is good way to spend one's ninety minutes.
Mike Myers as a womanizing secret agent and a evil villian is the highlight of the film and would be difficult to imagine someone else enacting these roles. The supporting cast comprising of Elizabeth Hurley, Robert Wagner & Mindy Sterling were fun to watch and compliment in Myer's respective roles.

That is why it pains me to say that Austin Powers was such repugnant, puerile, adolescent horse crap that I have ever seen. Ther was so much to work with in this amazing concept. This could have been the best comedy of the 90's, but the writing and performances by everyone made this one of the worst comedys since Porkys. Tom Arnold has a cameo performance in Austin Powers, and I have to say that his scene with Myers in the bathroom repeating ""who does #2 work for?"" has got to be the least amusing and utterly repugnant things I have ever seen. Tom Arnold is a very funny man too, but that performance would drive a person to insanity. I have never even bothered with the lame sequels to this crap.

First of all, I enjoyed Dr. Evil. I thought he was an excellent character. He was extremely weird and well conceived. However, I didn't care for Austin Powers himself and the never-ending sex-related humor. It ruined the movie for me. This movie could have been so much better without the sex-related humor. There were many other things about spy movies that they could have parodied. It was OK at first, the second time made me smile, but it went on and on and on and finally I was getting pretty upset!

What a peculiar creature.
This film tries to be flamboyant, but ends up being too heteronormative. Tries to be quirky, but lacks sincerity and sensitivity. Tries to be funny, but offers nothing more than set of standart stereotypical jokes. This is not the parody, this is just another spy movie that exploits same ugly tropes in a slightly different way.

Powers is paired with lovely British Agent Vanessa (Elizabeth Hurley), and endures some hilarious culture shock (as does his enemy) as he's introduced to a world where man has walked on the moon and Berlin is no longer divided. Myers offers side-splitting performances as both Powers and the equally bumbling Dr. Evil. A strong, hilarious script, although at some points, the jokes are just plain raunchy (and the toilet humor got worse in the two box office hit sequels).

Every so often, a funny line or situation pops up, such as when Dr. Evil demands a million dollars in international blackmail and his intended victims laugh their heads off, but there are far too few of these, and they're quickly pushed away to make room for some weak sex joke or pun.

202,say_andy,Doesn't age well...,4,18 July 2005,"I'm not sure how, but somehow I managed to miss the Austin Powers craze of the late 90's. I never went to see the flick, and then when it became a pop culture phenomenon, I didn't really feel like seeing it. Heck, since it was around everywhere and everyone thought they had an Austin Powers impersonation, I felt like I'd already seen it by extension. A few years ago, I managed to catch it on a bus trip, but I must've fallen asleep or was too busy talking because a lot of the movie felt unfamiliar. So this is a review from someone watching it in full for the first time a few days ago.Which is a bit unfair to the film, since it was such a huge part of pop culture when it came out, there's no way to view it unbiasedly now. To use the horribly tired phrase, this movie is so 1997. Like the title hero (and his nemesis), it's practically frozen in time itself, and watching it brings you back to the horrible time when everyone was saying ""shagadelic, baby"", or ""one million dollars"". *shudder* So, jokes that may have made me laugh were I to have seen it when it first came out make me roll my eyes now. I've seen so many clips of this flick that the jokes are already old. But, the thing is, I'm not sure if they would've been that great anyway. Mike Myers' style is to push a joke two or three (or four or five) beats past it being funny, in the hope that the pushing of the joke itself will be funny. It's a knowing wink to the audience that has made him a very successful man, but got old with me around the time of Wayne's World.In fact, pretty much all of Austin Powers' shtick got old for me very quickly. Like many films from Saturday Night Live, clever comedic premises (like the James Bond of the swinging-sixties parody) that would or have worked great in five minute segments fail to connect for a feature length film. The jokes are pretty obvious and juvenile, bodily humour jokes that I've never really enjoyed (well, not since making noises with my underarms stopped being the height of comedic genius). The parody of the film is clever, but the jokes fall flat.Well, I should say that most of the jokes fall flat. While Austin Powers himself does little for me, I do find Myers other character in the film, Dr. Evil, to be quite funny most of the time. Dr. Evil saved the movie for me, I loved his out-dated plans for world conquest, I loved his interactions with his son Scott (Seth Green), and loved the scene where he and Scott go to group therapy. That all made me laugh, even though I knew of most of the scenes.But, he wasn't funny enough for me to give the flick a passing grade.

People have picked up ""Shagadelic, baby!"", ""It's freedom, baby - yeah!"" and ""Oh behaaave..."" and one time a friend spontaneously did the Dr Evil 'dance' (when he's showing Scott that he's 'hip' and 'with it').

I never watch it anymore. I've seen it about 10 times now and I only laughed once, and it was very forgettable.

223,choppy,One Joke Movie,5,5 September 1998,"The movie started off great with an hilariously OTT psychedelic dance number, but steadily went down hill from there.  The character of Austin Powers was certainly a very funny creation, but that was all this spy spoof offered.  The jokes were predominantly predictable  toilet humour.  By the end I just wasn't laughing.  A huge disappointment after the hilarious beginning.Myers is at his best as Austin and provides us with some wonderful sound bites.  He's less successful however with the somewhat tiresome villain Dr Evil.  Hurley is a good foil as the sexy sidekick Miss Kensington.Spoofs are most effective when played deadpan where the characters seem to be acting normal and unaware of the lunacy around them.  See the Airplane! and Hot Shots series for examples of this.  Myers however is plainly having a lot of fun, which strangely leads to less fun for the viewer (e.g his never ending ""do you think I'm sexy"" scenes).",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
224,Lurch-12,Still one of my favorites,9,31 January 2000,"I've been insulted by the sequel to this movie and those that insist it's better.  In respect I will only say we are all entitled to an opinion, and humor is subjective and leave it at that. I've read many of the comments about this movie, and to those who enjoy it as much as I do ""you're switched on, you're smashing"".  It isn't as one review put it deserving of ""the best"", ""the funniest"", ""the greatest"" or most of these other cliché titles people spout.

225,Tomrad,"Shagadelic baby, yeah!",8,20 July 1999,"Absoloutely wonderful movie. Mike Myers plays a superb double part - each character with his own way of talking and mannerisms. Many times during the movie you forget that they are played by the same person, they are so brilliantly played. Amazing. Characterization down to a tee. As for the gags, I can't fault them - Mike Myers' writing skills are great and very funny - even more so as he is prepared to play the 2 main characters himself. Just take a look at the memorable quotes section if you're in any doubt. The inclusion of Scott, Dr. Evil's teenage son, is absolutely side-splitting, especially the ""sh"" routine. Yeah, baby! As for Liz Hurley, well, she's a babe. Also a very good actress, though. Anyway, I love the film. I have been going round with my little finger to my lips for the past week since I saw it, it's so funny and compelling that you can't help but be picked up in this wonderful pschycadelic James Bond spoof that is Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery (cue that extremely annoying theme song) 10 out of 10!

Which in that case you only need to tap slightly in any place and it will collapse instantly.Synopsis for the social influentially impaired: Austin Powers is a '60s secret agent who was frozen in cryostate to be thawed when his great nemesis, Dr. Evil returns in another attempt to take over the world. He gets thawed out in 1997 and discovers the ""Free love no longer rain and greed and corruption rule again.""Austin Powers is what Mike Myers always wanted to do, and to say it simply, I hope he does better than dreams. I think this is a hasty movie, ending at 87 minutes and it still looks like it was done in the form ""That's a good scene, I want it in, that's good too, put that in, that's...eh...not so good, but put it in also.""Mike Myers did some other, greater films like ""So I married an axe murderer"" that was better and ""Wayne's World"" (Only the first) but that's about it from what I've seen.I didn't see the sequel and I don't intend paying 'A some of money equivalent to 6$ for it' and I don't even know if I'll add it to my video collection when, if ever, it will appear on video.To conclude, ""If you see only one movie this year, go see The Matrix; If you see two movies, then go see Star Wars; if you see three, then still don't see Austin Powers, Go-Go see Inspector Gadget or Tarzan, I'm sure there are much better.""",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

Most parodies of James Bond make fun only of ""The name is Bond, James Bond,"" and the fact that you don't see Blofeld's face in the movies. That gets extremely old after a while, and that is why Austin Powers is so good. It makes fun of other, funnier things, such as the bad jokes the hero makes when killing a villain, the villains' never killing the hero when he has the chance, and the hero's only wanting to have fun. If you're tired of all the James Bond movies' stupid points, or if you just want to laugh a whole lot, see Austin Powers. It's cool!",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

Those who deem it stupidly elementary must have no funny bone to be tickled, or they must have laid their inner, silly child to death. What a pity really. Mike Myers is responsible for 2 of the most funny characters ever on screen: Austin and Dr. Evil, the latter having a slight edge. It is tight, clever comedy and not at all stupid, unlike a lot of the other grossed out comedies that it may be grouped with.

The third time it was kind of funny.  Ever since, if I see it more than once a year, it makes me sick. Michael Myers is a very funny talented individual, however many of the jokes in Austin Powers just are not funny.  The jokes that are funny are not sophisticated enough to endure.  ""All right, you tell that turd who's boss!"" is only funny so many times.  I am a college student, and I own about 110 VHS movies.  This movie is not one of them.

But I really disapprove the nudity "" suggested"" in middle and at the end of the movie-especially those nudity scenes didn't appear to be necessary! Or at least those scenes could be reduced to minimum.I really think those scenes somehow destroy a bit of the genius ideas behind the scripts.

If you are a fan of James Bond campiness then you will probably appreciate this film.As with most watchable films, it's the casting that makes it - Mike Myers is a GENIUS-even at his worst he's still at least good (and he's at his best in this film), the rest of the cast do their job perfectly. Tom Arnold is just great and though I might be biased as a Buffy fan, they could not have cast a better Scott Evil :-)So to the people who have flamed this film - yeah it's not going to be regarded as the new Citizen Kane, but it's still a damn funny film and if you don't ""get it"" then I suggest you obtain a sense of humour before you watch any more films.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

It's not that the film sports witty or straight-out jokes or situations - it's all in the timing, the expressions - it's just plain cheekey baby! Ironic that it's an American (OK Meyers is Canadian) poking harmless fun at the English, yet the average American just can't appreciate it because they don't understand the English 60's-style humor that's used throughout the film. The English who can't laugh at themselves (myself not included) don't like it because they take the brunt of most of the jokes.If you watch this film and thought it was 'OK' - watch it again a few days later - then again and again. It get's funnier every time. I've lost count how many times (at least 70!) I've seen it and it still makes me laugh out loud, but the first time I watched it I didn't know really what to make of it all.There's something magical about this movie that was missing from the sequel - I hope that magic returns in Austin Powers III.10/10 - go buy it!",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

It isn't. It's so much more than those. sure, it's got predictable gags and one-liners, but they aren't what's funny about the movie. neither are the direct James Bond inspired thingies (dr Evil? number 2? slow killing contraptions?) They are indeed predictable and mostly quite stupid. But simply saying that, and judging the movie by it is not doing it any justice. The point wasn't the joke, it was killing the joke over and over. The point wasn't the obvious spoof. it was the whole movie not the single parts. it was the subtle direction parody, not dr. evil. It was ... the fact that it's not a '60s or Bond parody, but a parody of the nineties. of our way of life. It was also a parody of every comical movie available by simply taking a joke and then making it ten times dumber, more obvious and generally unexpected because of this, and then repeating the joke ad nauseam and ultimately killing it.

238,ITAFilm,Who is this guy? And why is he so evil?,9,12 June 1999,"What I want to know is, how did Austin get to be such a jerk?  He realizes that his true love, Vanessa, is a FemBot, and spends exactly three seconds mourning this fact.  Why couldn't the movie have been about AP trying to find his mojo -- only because his true love's ""train has sailed""? (and why would British Intelligence screw over their best man?  ""Yes, Austin ... we knew it all along,"" says Basil Exposition).Finally, in AP: IMOM, -that- Austin would not have called himself a ""sexy bitch"" over and over and over.  Yeah, it was amusing the first time, but the other four or five lost their luster FAST.  This guy is waaayyy too much into himself and shows us nothing of the vulnerable yet shagadelic AP from the first film.The film's laugh were huge (Frau spraying Mini Me with the water was a huge hit with me), but not as witty or constant as in the first film of this franchise.I work at movie theatre, so I can see this film for free until my eyes bleed... but I'll only go to it again because I don't have to pay.Let's send good wishes (and a few prayers!) to Myers and Roach before they get started on AP3.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
239,Nik-64,"Silly in parts, but quite entertaining overall",7,13 July 2000,"The preview to this movie is misleading. They describe Austin as 'the coolest secret agent' of his time in the 1960s, but not fitting in in the 1990s. This last bit is perfectly true, but as to the rest...Austin is out of place because he's a complete sleaze. According  to the 1960 situation, it was commonplace then but he can't expect to do the same now, especially with the woman he teams up with, Vanessa Kensington, who has high principiles.Indeed, the 'secret agent' component of Austin's character plays second fiddle to his womanising, which gets him into trouble at least once. Basil Expostion quite rightly warned him to 'be careful'. Austin is actually quite careless when he's not being a secret agent and at times he comes across as plain silly.But Powers is also funny. There's a lot of slapstick humour through the plot, many of it coming straight from the cat's (ie Powers') mouth. Dr Evil is a very suitable bad-guy (a take off of a past villain so I hear) and different in every way from powers, so I never guessed that he was played also by Mike Myers. A very good job done.The introduction is very colourful and a solid start. A less believeable part is that all the characters, apart from Austin and Dr Evil, are supposed to have aged 30 years into the 90s, but they don't look much older. Austin may as well not bothered to have frozen himself if he too aged so slightly.Austin is also a professional photographer. His antics sort of put the main plot of the story (stopping Dr Evil blowing up the world) into the background. But it doesn't matter particularly. There's a lost of funny original segments (which are unfortunately repeated in the sequel). For these reasons, this movie can be watched times over and still a lot gotten out of it. Mike Myers has done a decent job overall. 7/10",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

The OTT (I know it's meant to be) ""acting"" of Myers and the wooden performance of Hurley (I'm sure she was wondering what she had got herself into) were excruciating.

He delivers one of the funniest villains ever captured in cinematic form. Austin Powers is also best on a lot of 60's spoofs such as James Bond, and a lot of 60's trends.

There are jokes every 5 minutes and moments that will leave you laughing for hours.  Almost every joke and comment is original so the movie is entirely unpredictable and incredibly funny.

After reading others' glowing comments I keep thinking to myself ""Did they see the same movie I saw?"", ""Am I becoming a stuffed shirt humorless old fart?"".

Slipping on a banana peel (say) is funny the first three times, but after that the laughs dry up. The film is only enjoyable as an exercise in spotting the homages to James Bond movies - and there are a lot.  Unfortunately, like the jokes, the spoofs are cranked right up past the redline so that us dumb old viewers catch them.  For example, Myers' charicature of Blofeld works better as an impersonation of the Tin Man from the Wizard of Oz.The film lasts 90 minutes - usually this seems too short, but for this film it's an eternity.  The alternative endings and cut footage on the DVD release show that they filmed more material - which they decided not to include even though there was plenty of time - what does this say about quality?",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
257,s@tori,Low comedy; decent spoof; good nostalgia; poor production,6,19 July 1999,"Austin Powers, International Man of Mystery is funny.  It's not witty. It's none too smart.  It could have been much, much funnier.  However it is undeniably funny, if you like disjointed sketch comedy stretch out to its maximum degree and if you have seen the plethora of films being spoofed. It isn't just James Bond films (Connery only, Myers has some taste) being parodied, nor even the genre (Avengers, The Prisoner, Secret Agent, Our Man Flint), it is also the 'long-60's era' (The Graduate, The better Carry On films, Casino Royale, The Mouse That Roared, I Love You Alice B. Toklas, Smashing Time, Sleeper).The main problem here is that in Casino Royale, for instance, Peter Sellers - Myers' obvious template - already did a fantastic sendup of Bond.  In that same film Ursula Andress was far more interesting and sexy than Alotta Fagina.  Robert Wagner couldn't even begin to have the screen presence of Orson Welles as Le Chifre.  In fact virtually nothing in Austin Powers is original.  It's just a different person's vision of the same thing: parody revisited.  In the best such parodies, however, the comedy is most effective when played straight.  Austin Powers is intentionally camp and thus loses the edge it could have had, especially if it had been better written.Two things *are* original, or very nearly.  The contextual juxtaposition of the 60's and the 90's is amusing and should have been taken much further. The character of Dr Evil - who in a reverse of the Bond norm is the only character *with* a character - is very interesting and could have been further explored.  And this is exactly where the film shows its true character:  half developed ideas lost in the attempt to spoof an era.  This is just a long series of sketches welded together...vaguely.  The production quality is also low.  This may have been part of the parody, but I don't think it is.If you want to see hilarious, intelligent low-budget sketch comedy beautifully welded into a single story, see Monty Python and the Holy Grail. If you want a good giggle and someone else pays, Austin Powers is a good choice...if you've seen the right movies to get the jokes.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

He is incredibly talented when creating characters (DIETER and SIMON the kid in the bath on SATURDAY NIGHT LIFE were some of the best in the tv show) and Austin Powers/Doctor Evil is maybe his best routine ever.  Hurley has the kind of rare sex-appeal that we don't see in any current leading ladies today.

I stumbled upon it on a video rental store, and got because I had always liked Mike Myers from his work at Saturday Night Live and the first Wayne´s World. I was delighted with the freshness of the spoofs and ideas, all the thousands of little jokes they placed all along. You can´t take your eyes away from the TV for a minute without missing a joke. I cried out of laughter at that meeting room sequence, when Dr. Evil punishes a reckless collaborator using all sorts of villain clichés in the book... it´s all fun. The sequel to it gave way to much more of Myers ego than his talent, and to me it was too nasty sometimes.

This movie can be called a spoof of other spy movies, i.e. James Bond, however it is more of its own movie than just a spoof. Most run-offs don't have much of a plot, instead mainly focus on the comedic aspects of the movie it steals from. Austin Powers has both, and more. It has an entertaining, enjoyable plot, interesting characters, beautiful women, and of course Clint Howard as 'Johnson Ritter'. After plenty of movie flops and no really big picture since Wayne's World, many people considered Mike Myers washed up beyond salvation. But he has proved us all wrong in an absolutely breathtaking rendition of comedic genius.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

Especially after seeing the slightly inferior (but still VERY funny) sequel I can really appreciate the original humor of the first Austin Powers which gets even better on repeated viewings. This may very well Mike Myers best movie to date. Recommended especially to fans of the James Bond franchise but also to everyone else (just in case anybody out there hasn't seen it yet).I know this isn't a talkback forum, but there's one thing I'd like to say to ""KittyKat-8"" about the inflationary use of the word ""disgusting"" : even if you prefer watching Disney movies (as your comment history suggests) you should reserve terms like that for films that really deserve it like Pink Flamingos, Cannibal Holocaust or Sleepless in Seattle.

Every scene is perfectly crafted but in a way that seems effortless. And the cast are clearly having a whale of a time.The cuts away from the main narrative to the otherwise unfeatured family and friends of the henchmen that die along the way are inspired - and has become an often-imitated device in comedy (e.g. South Park).The dialogue is unforgettable and hilarious throughout, but the biggest coup the film pulls off is that it can be watched over and over again and the jokes don't get tired.

276,Code_Green,Good First Movie in Austin Powers Trilogy,7,27 July 2002,"For a starting movie in the Austin Powers Trilogy, I would have to say that this was pretty funny. It had a good cast. The actors and actresses seemed a little bit up-tight about their roles, but eventually they get more comfortable in the sequels ""The Spy Who Shagged Me"" & ""Goldmember.""The plot is basically that back in 1967, Dr. Evil, who threatened the world, froze himself and the only person that was able to defeat him, Austin Powers, froze himself as well. Dr. Evil defrosted himself in 1997 and Austin was then defrosted too. Dr. Evil's latest plan is to steal a nuclear warhead and hold the world hostage for one million dollars...which was later changed to one hundred billion dollars. Austin, with the help of his new partner Vanessa, adapts to the '90s and together they eventually defeat Dr. Evil.There were many great laughs. The characters were creative like Alotta Fagina. I was cracking up the whole time that she was on screen or if Austin and Vanessa referred to her in some way. ""She's the village bicycle. Everyone's had a ride.""Great perfomances by Robert Wagner as Number Two, Mindy Sterling as Frau, and Elizabeth Hurley as Vanessa Kensington really made the movie. Mike Myers plays Austin Powers and Dr. Evil really well. This movie was very well done. I would recommend anyone that is a spy movie fan or just someone looking for a good laugh to rent this movie. I highly recommend seeing the sequels if you like this and even if you don't like this, I would still recommend renting the sequels because the sequels seem to get better as the series goes on.I gave this movie a rating of 7 out of 10.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

Enjoying 'Austin Powers' is about letting loose, getting off that intellectual high horse, and opening up to a brand of humour. The thing is, everyone creating Austin Powers KNOWS the jokes are farcical, overdone and lame; they know their material is widely associated with bad comedy. Yet, they take that fact and turn it 180 degrees to create a comedy style that offers more: a parody of itself almost. Most definitely, a love it or leave it movie.

I think Austin Powers is hilarious and it's a super fun spoof of the James Bond films, but International Man of Mystery surprisingly hasn't aged well at all. I was quite saddened at just how sophomoric and juvenile this movie is. Did the movie make me laugh? Yeah. Often? Ehh, sadly no. I don't know if I can pin point why, but this movie is awkward and if feels it length instead of going by fast. One of the problems I can point out is that all the sex/sexual scenes aren't funny at all, so there's this weird blurred line between trying to be funny and trying to make you aroused so you just look at it in confusion. The 2 latter Austin Powers films are really funny because they are just so outragous but this one struggles to get off the ground. The pee gag that lasts almost a whole minute still cracks me up but there are some pretty lame jokes that go on for too long like the evil laugh scene. There is some pretty good 007 parody stuff in the movie but some of it was WAY too on the nose, i.e when Dr. Evil deliberately admits that his trap is easy to escape. I enjoy the nuance and the subtly of the spoof aspects but at some points they just tossed it in the garbage.The Spy Who Shagged Me and Goldmember are hilarious and I would like to see a 4th one but I think I'll be skipping this one from now on.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
306,Mark-32,Great idea badly mishandled,3,27 March 1999,"Most of the comments seem to cast this as a lowbrow vs highbrow humor issue. I like lowbrow humor as much as anyone--give me Benny Hill and toilet humor any day--but this movie is just badly done. The script needs a script doctor to tighten it up and the direction, editing, and pacing is way off key. The biggest problem is that they don't know when to stop and they let gags that are potentially funny just die by dragging them out. Austin says, ""I like women of that calibre"" after the go-go girls uses her bra gun ... but then he has to go on to explain the pun ... and then there's a long pause and a long giggle--by the time all this is over the joke has been completely killed. Austin announces his ransom demand to the UN, and then gives a parody of the evil villian's laugh--funny--and he laughs again--funny. By the time the punchline comes (everyone's laugh petering out) it's the 20th repitition, and the viewer doesn't care anymore. There was lots of potential here, but it was squandered. All the good parts are in the trailer--watch that and buy an Austin Powers promotional penis enlarger, but skip the movie.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

309,wabb,Benny Hill lives,4,20 February 1999,"Austin Powers is a great concept. Pity that there may not have been enough money for something richer than an extended skit.  This is much like a Benny Hill skit: amusing concept, some laughs-mostly based on sexual inuendo.  Bottom line: not enough to hold interest for the span of a movie. Would love to see someone else do it better.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
310,noel-11,This movie is absolutely hilarious.,10,6 January 1999,"After seeing Austin Powers for the first time, I couldn't stop quoting the movie.

It's full of site gags, obscene jokes, and the like. But it doesn't matter. Because all these elements make this one of the funniest comedies ever. I can't stand people I know bashing the film because they think it's too dumb for them. C'mon, if you don't find it funny, then I'd say that's pretty dumb. But what do I know? :-PJUST SEE IT!

318,brookjones,The Intelligent Intelligence Spoof,10,12 November 2000,"This film has gained wide popular appeal, leading some to dismiss it as a lowbrow, sophomoric attempt; to be lumped in with Sandler and his ilk. But this is not the case.While Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery does contain it's fair share of (genuinely funny) sight gags and rude humour, it also succeeds comedically on a much higher level. The precision with which Myers simultaneously both satirizes and pays homage to the spy films of the sixties (including, but not limited to, the classic Bonds) and '60s swinger culture is uncanny. In both Dr. Evil and Austin, Myers creates rich, highly memorable characters whose personalities give rise to the film's humour; as opposed to the flat, one-dimensional characters that comedies are so often saddled with. As a screenwriter, Myers is both highly literate and well-read. His dialogue (both in its writing and its delivery) is classic: well-scripted, well-phrased and well-timed. While Myers undeniably carries the film, the supporting cast is also terrific. Elizabeth Hurley, Michael York and Robert Wagner all successfully bring their respective characters to life, and sparkle in their relationships with Austin and Dr. Evil, respectively.The pacing and direction are top-notch. Never does a scene drag on to the point of annoying the viewer, and the plot barely gives you time to catch your breath. The cinematography is above-average for a comedy; the special effects are a terrific mix of competent modern technology and perfectly understated vintage sixties film techniques (rear-projection, pasted-on gun flashes, etc.). The sets and costumes, similarly, are self-consciously true to the genre (""Do you like your quasi-futuristic clothes, Mr. Powers? I designed them myself.""), which only adds to the movie's humour.All in all, this is a brilliant film, mixing in exactly the right proportions belly-laugh gags with a genuinely sly, subtle level of satire. Highly recommended.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

The penis inflator gag is amazing, and I love how it makes fun of how dumb spy movie villans are. Scott is a great and hilarious character. The whole WHO DOES NUMBER TWO WORK FOR scene is amazing.But the movie is also quite objectifying. And also gross. And this is just my opinion and I know it is part of the joke, but Austin Powers is a truly repulsive human in this movie, so I don't get why all these women were so horny for him. He is also quite annoying in my mind.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
322,jeff-267,Brilliant.,10,13 December 2001,"AP1 is an excellent spoof of all the cheesy 60's British spy movies. Myers humor and timing is excellent, and portrays two hilarious characters Dr. Evil and of course Austin Powers. I'm not sure what grade level the other person needs for a comedy to be enjoyable though. College humor? Mid-life crisis humor? Senile dementia humor? Oh well, all in good fun. The first is definitely much better than the second, where the jokes are rehashed, much like Myer's former SNL, and Myers seems to have forgotten why he wrote the first script in the first place. It wasn't out of inspiration for a film with midgets and fat bastards.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery

Mike Myers takes on many unusual characters, with unusual names. I have to say that this movie is not for everyone. Not everyone like these kind of humor, but it is a great movie just to sit back relax, and have a good time.

325,walleynejr,Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery,8,24 April 2011,"Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery is a comedy/science fiction film by definition. This is the first installment of the Austin Powers series. Austin Powers was premiered in 1997. Directed by Jay Roach and written by Mike Myers, who stars a dual role in the film. The Austin Powers films were intended be a parody off of the James Bond movies. The film starts out in 1967, with Austin Powers a British spy who attempts to assassinate his nemesis Dr. Evil. Dr. Evil successfully escapes, launching himself in a space rocket disguised as a Big Boy's statue. From there the movie jumps forward, 30 years in time to 1997. The film stars Mike Myers as Austin Powers and Dr. Evil, Elizabeth Hurley as Vanessa Kensington, and Will Ferrell as Mustafa among other talented actors and actresses. The theme of the film parodies numerous James Bond, Derek Flint, Jason King, and Matt Helm films, characters, and video games. These films are incorporated with other elements of pop culture and they follow the British spy's heroic quest to bring the villain Doctor Evil to justice. The films poke fun at the outrageous plots, rampant sexual innuendo, and one-dimensional stock characters associated with 1960s spy films, as well as the cliché of the ultra-suave male super spy. Contrary to the handsome, super-smooth leading men of the James Bond genre, Austin Powers is not characterized as being conventionally attractive (he is especially known for his bad teeth), although female characters in the films seem to find him irresistible. The general theme of the films is that the arch-villain Dr. Evil plots to extort large sums of money from governments or international bodies but is constantly thrown off by British super-spy Austin Powers, and (to a degree) his own inexperience with life and culture in the 1990s.There's a lot of lighting effects that are used in the film. All the explosions and fire are effects that are used to enhance the film. For example, when Dr. Evil is escaping from Austin in his ""space ship"" disguised as the Big Boy statue, it appears as if he is traveling through space, all lighting effects. The angels that are used in the film are pretty much a standard, straight on, clear cut shot. The director uses some close ups to enhance the features of The Man of Mystery, for example his teeth. These techniques are two of the most important in my opinion, when it comes to a film we all want to be entertained. It's funny how a simple flashing light or a camera angle can affect how we watch a film and how much we enjoy the actual film.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
326,max-huettner,Verry funny if you have this kind of humor,9,29 May 2019,I love this movie because it perfectly matches my kind of humor. But I can understand that this is not true for all the people watched this movie.,Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
327,clb1095,Best quote ever,10,5 January 2017,"""The details of my life are quite inconsequential. Very well, where do I begin? My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with a low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a 15 year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink, he would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Sometimes he would accuse chestnuts for being lazy, the sort of general malaise that only the genus possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical, summers in Rangoon, Luge lessons. In the spring we would make meat helmets, when I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds, pretty standard really. At the age of 12 I received my first scribe, and at the age of 14 a Zoroastrian named Vilma, ritualistically shaved my testicles. There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum, its breathtaking, I suggest you try it."" - Dr. Evil^ Just one of the reasons why this film is the greatest comedy of all time.",Austin Powers - International Man of Mystery
328,coolhandluke04,Fun and funny flick,8,27 February 2005,"Mike Myers does a fantastic job of taking a movie genre - that I'm sure he enjoyed watching as a young man - and exploiting it for the purposes of his comic genius. I especially enjoy that he used so many elements from many different movies to bring together the plot and develop it for the character of Austin Powers: International Man of Mystery. Watch the second movie ""Austin Powers, the Spy who Shagged Me"" once you have seen this one - and not before. This is what great comedians do. They take what they know & love and point out the laughs that can be had from it. Ironically, I just saw an interview with Mike Myers in which he admitted that his family, particularly his mother, were of the opinion - and may still be - that Mike was/is not funny. His mother, a Liverpool, England native, has always told him, ""your brothers are funny - but not you Michael"" ??? BRAVO, Mr Myers, you proved mum wrong. We just have to sit back and enjoy.

I would love to see more of Seth Green in many more movies, because he rocks as an actor. I love him. I love Seth Green. He is extremely handsome and I totally dig short guys. He adds more flavor to any movie in which appears in. I would just like him to know that I am his no. 1 fan. Boy, not being able to express myself in this comment kind of sucks. Oh well. I guess anyways, he should be making more movies that show him as the star. I would like to see him more as a leading man, not just a sidekick. He has enormous talent and his talent should not go to waste. I know I wouldn't waste it. Boy, I would give anything just to kiss and hug him.

It was hilarious when my friends and I first went to see it back in high school (it was so funny we ended up going to see it a second time which we only ever did for two movies so that is a big deal for us since we had like no money!) and it is still hilarious today.This is the role that really made Mike Myers a huge star. I don't like the sequels as much but hopefully they make more and they will be hilarious again. The second movie was still pretty good but the third was not.He's a hilarious James Bond spoof where all he wants to do is shag and be groovy and his teeth are like horse's teeth.

He says a funny line in almost every quote, and it makes the movie so funny I can watch it over and over again without ever getting bored. Now when thats said, every sentence is so perfectly made, and I realize every time I see the film that something new is in every sentence, that I didn't discover earlier. Some might say though, that some scenes in this movie are a bit stupid perhaps, and with no meaning whatsoever, but I know they where put there for a reason, and they work perfectly well to bind all the scenes together.
