0,MartinHafer,The worms turn...and how!,9,28 August 2021,"I knew the basic story and ending of ""Thelma & Louise"" and because of that, I hadn't bothered seeing it until tonight. I am glad I finally got around to seeing it, as the writing (mostly) and acting and direction were all top-notch...and the filming locations in Utah (although the film supposedly is set in Arizona, New Mexico, Oklahoma and Arkansas).When the story begins Thelma (Gena Davis) is about to go on a little vacation with her friend Louise (Susan Sarandon). However, Thelma's husband is a real jerk and she's afraid to tell him and so she just disappears. At first, the pair are just two ladies out on a little girls trip. But when a piece of garbage tries to rape Thelma, the pair make some BAD choices. Louise justifiably shoots him...but instead of going to the police, they run. At first, they STILL could possibly turn themselves in an beat the rap. But when Thelma commits an armed robbery, suddenly the pair have crossed over the edge...and subsequent crimes are a bit easier to commit. Of course, they can't get away with it forever.The acting is just amazing. I also appreciate how things are NOT black & white. While a lot of men are pigs in the film, not all are and a few are decent. I was REALLY surprised by Harvey Keitel's character, as with his history, you'd expect him to be the worst sort of pig...but he plays an amazingly decent and likable cop. My only complaint about the characters is that they made Thelma a bit too stupid...though she does fortunately learn! Overall, an exciting film...one that has a lot to say and is among the best movies of the year...and I actually preferred it to the big winner at the Oscars that year.",Thelma & Louise
1,TheLittleSongbird,"Outstanding road movie, and much more than a chick flick",10,11 January 2011,"I like Ridley Scott and I like his films. While not his very best, I do think it is up there with his best. It is never less than hugely entertaining, with a sparkling script, an arresting story, great direction from Scott and lovely cinematography and scenery. Also Hans Zimmer's score, while not his best, is quite nice and somewhat different to what I have come to expect from him. The cast are wonderful, Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon are brilliant leads, and Harvey Keitel is solid. It was also nice to see a young Brad Pitt. I know Thelma and Louise caused controversy at the time with the issue of the sight of women with guns, but that makes no difference to me. All that matters is that the movie entertained me and it did that superbly. 10/10 Bethany Cox",Thelma & Louise
2,bkoganbing,A Feminist Classic,8,5 March 2009,"A pair of bored thirty something friends decide on a girl's weekend and in that time become the most wanted women in America. Not that bedding either Susan Sarandon or Geena Davis hasn't got its delightful aspects, but that's not the kind of wanted I'm talking about.The film is shot in some of the reddest part of red state America where gender roles and rules are laid down real specific and you don't cross them. Just these two women going out without husband or significant other partner of the opposite sex means they're loose and available.So when alpha male Timothy Carhart decides after some line dancing at a county honky-tonk that Geena's hot to trot, he decides to do something about it in the parking lot. And if she resists he certainly knows how to bring her in line. But when Sarandon pulls a gun on him he backs down very reluctantly. In fact Carhart's defiant attitude and assumed male superiority snaps something in Sarandon and she blows him away on general principles. After that they're on the run. Sarandon and Davis work beautifully together in Thelma&Louise. Close friends before the homicide takes place, they learn a lot about each other on the journey. They air out finally the way they feel women have been treated in their part of the country. Though I wouldn't recommend women act out quite the way they do, the film remains a great feminist manifesto.Harvey Keitel does a fine job as a caring police officer who wants to bring them in with no problems and before they run up a real criminal record. Christopher McDonald and Michael Madsen are the men in their lives, both in their different ways clueless as to what is going on inside Thelma&Louise. Just the fact they wanted a girl's vacation should have lit up some bulb.McDonald, Madsen are just two of the men these two get to degrade and humiliate on their merry race with destiny. One however that gets the better of them is Brad Pitt in his breakthrough role as a young cowboy they find hitchhiking and give a lift to. Despite their new found feminism, Sarandon and Davis are still quite vulnerable in some areas, as are we all.Callie Khouri won an Oscar for Best Screenplay written directly for the screen. Thelma&Louise got five other nominations including for both Sarandon and Davis for Best Actress. They split the balloting as is what usually happens and Jodie Foster took her second Oscar home for Silence Of The Lambs.Thelma&Louise is destined to be a classic and a feminist manifesto for generations.",Thelma & Louise
3,Leofwine_draca,Holds up very well,6,14 October 2018,"THELMA & LOUISE is the ultimate feminist movie in Hollywood history and seen today it holds up very well, helped no end by Ridley Scott's slick and stylish direction. The film features Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis, very well cast as a pair of friends who go on a road trip which ends in unforeseen circumstances. The film has a really fresh feel to it, even today, mixing in various elements to fine effect; there are laughs, buddy buddy bonding, chase elements, romance, family drama, action scenes, and Harvey Keitel as the dogged cop. Of course, it's best remembered today for THAT ending, and for good reason, but the rest holds up too.",Thelma & Louise
4,SnoopyStyle,unique Road movie,8,23 November 2013,"Louise (Susan Sarandon) is a diner waitress. She takes her friend housewife Thelma (Geena Davis) to a nice quiet cabin that belongs to her manager. When a slick cowboy tries to violently rape Thelma at a truck stop, Louise takes matters into her own hands. This sets off a chain of events that ends with the iconic leap over the cliff.This is a road trip through the beer-swilling football-watching truck-loving underclass of the American south. Director Ridley Scott expertly films the action and the landscape. Davis and Sarandon provide the chemistry. It's a dark take on the traditional buddy road movie. Harvey Keitel plays the police detective Hal investigating the murder. It has since become notable for Brad Pitt's big breakout role as the hustler JD.There is some action but it's not a big action movie. This is really a buddy movie between the girls. Their friendship is where the big action is. There are slow sections in this movie. But the superior actors make it worthwhile. And Geena Davis has some hilarious moments.",Thelma & Louise
5,Hitchcoc,"When You're Dead, You're Dead",4,3 January 2017,"You know, Hollywood can be pretty casual about suicide. This is an irreversible decision to a short term problem. When the two women go over the cliff in a blaze of glory, they are about to be dead. They are giving up the most precious gift they have, their own lives, because they are about to be apprehended. I have trouble with the sheer stupidity of these two characters who apparently many viewers see has heroic. Obviously, the inciting incident, the attempted rape by the guy they shoot, was totally wrong. It's also a reality that in some hole in the wall bar, getting friendly with a stranger and drinking too much could get you into a horrible situation. It's not right; it just is! So now they're off and what's next? They meet the smooth talking Brad Pitt character. He already admits he's a small time crook, so they leave a bunch of money around for him to take. Then, after robbing a gas station, they get into it with some stupid truck driver. Of course, the portrayal is that every male they come into contact sees them and pulls down his pants. I know! It's just a movie. This leads them to their final act. Without contemplating the possibility that they could probably survive this...off the cliff they go with smiles on their faces. If they had been real people, it would have meant there were two less idiots left in the world.",Thelma & Louise
6,classicsoncall,"""Look out, because my hair is coming down!""",9,17 December 2018,"I'm reminded of a quote from ""No Country For Old Men"" - ""Well this is just a deal gone wrong, isn't it?""For best buds Thelma (Geena Davis) and Louise (Susan Sarandon), their weekend adventure turned into a road trip from hell, paved not with good intentions but with one miserably bad decision after another. What the screenplay does quite clearly though, is allow the protagonists to understand the consequences of their actions and make conscious, if not always rational decisions about what their next move might be. The first domino to fall right after Louise shot Harlan (Timothy Carhart) was her belief that a self defense argument wouldn't fly because of the number of witnesses who saw Harlan dancing and putting the moves on Thelma. It's a probable coin toss that says the girls wouldn't have been believed, but with that decision, the rest of the story cascades headlong into oblivion for the inseparable gal pals.The one character who could have made a difference in the outcome of the story was Detective Hal Slocumb (Harvey Keitel). His insight into the case brought him to the conclusion that the girls weren't intrinsically bad, but were acting on impulse and could potentially be brought to justice in a fair manner. He's overruled each time by his supervisor (Stephen Tobolowsky), who takes more of a gung-ho approach in apprehending the bad guys than in offering a sympathetic ear. The only thing I didn't get about the investigation was why all the agents hung out at Darryl's (Christopher McDonald) house instead of doing their leg work in the field. That just seemed too laid back and lazy to me.You got a sense of where the resolution to the story was going when Thelma initially brought up the idea that she didn't want to go back if captured, her comments seconding Louise's desire to remain free to make their own decision about their fate. When it came time to face their very own Butch and Sundance moment, they did it with the utmost conviction of going out on their own terms. In this case though, what might have been an admirable decision under different circumstances, closed the door on any kind of life affirming conclusion.",Thelma & Louise
7,lee_eisenberg,this is what modern classics are all about,10,22 May 2005,"I may not know anyone named Thelma, but whenever I meet someone named Louise, I will probably be tempted to remember ""Thelma & Louise"". This story of two women (Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis) who have to go on the lam after one of them kills a rapist in chauvinistic Texas truly shows the potentials of life.I guess that the main question is not whether or not ""Thelma & Louise"" is a women's empowerment story (although it certainly is). Really, it looks at our deep-down capabilities. Solid performances by Sarandon and Davis, not to mention Harvey Keitel and an up-and-coming Brad Pitt, and solid direction from Ridley Scott make this one of the best movies of 1991.",Thelma & Louise
8,jboothmillard,Thelma & Louise,10,22 September 2005,"Oscar and BAFTA nominated director Sir Ridley Scott (Alien, Blade Runner, Gladiator) directs an excellent road movie starring two of the most unlikely heroes I know in any film. Basically Thelma Dickerson (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Geena Davis) a house wife, and Louise Sawyer (Oscar, BAFTA and Golden Globe nominated Susan Sarandon) a café waitress are best friends, and decide to secretly go on a fishing trip together. Unfortunately, on the way Thelma is nearly raped and Louise killed the man who attempted it. They are now driving as far as they can to avoid the police, they obviously think their guilty of murder. Thelma's husband Darryl (Christopher McDonald) eventually finds out what his wife has done, and detective Hal Slocombe (Harvey Keitel) is probably the only one who knows their situation and wants to help. Along the way to Mexico, Thelma and Louise meet J.D. (Brad Pitt) and give him a ride, who steals their money given by Louise's love Jimmy (Michael Madsen) forcing them to rob a store, they hold a cop at gunpoint putting him in his trunk, shoot and explode a truck, and in the end, drive off the Grand Canyon to avoid capture, with an iconic freeze frame to white ending. Also starring Stephen Tobolowsky as Max and Timothy Carhart as Harlan. David and Sarandon are brilliant leads, the supporting cast, especially then little know Pitt, do very well too, and it is great fun to watch. It won the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and was nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Cinematography, Best Editing, Best Original Film Score for Hans Zimmer, Best Screenplay - Original and Best Film, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Screenplay - Motion Picture, and was nominated for Best Motion Picture - Drama. Susan Sarandon was number 25, and Brad Pitt number 15 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Pitt was also number 5 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, he was number 52 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, and he was number 30 on The World's Greatest Actor, Thelma & Louise (Heroes) were number 24 on 100 Years, 100 Heroes & Villains, the film was number 41 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments for Davis with Pitt, it was number 76 on 100 Years, 100 Thrills, and it was number 78 on 100 Years, 100 Cheers. Outstanding!",Thelma & Louise
9,rmax304823,All Men Are Brutes,3,1 March 2002,"Susan Sarandon is a delight as always, with her exopthalmia and perky nose. Geena Davis, in her first big role since her appearance in ""The Accidental Tourist"" is also good, and yummy in a toothy sort of way. The movie is fun to watch but it's silly in a desperate kind of way, slapping each other's palms and going ""Wheee!"" as they sail off together into the Grand Canyon. (The photography is sunny and splendid.) More important than the performances, more important than the photography, more important than anything else about the film is that it is a perfect illustration of a sociological point -- It is impossible to have bonding without an enemy. People not only bond WITH one another but AGAINST others. (Anyone into social psychology should check out Muzafer Sheriff's classic ""Robber's Cave"" experiment before seeing this flick.) That's why the president's hooper rating always soars after a national crisis such as a terrorist attack. Suddenly our bonds with each other as ""Americans"" become more important than internal differences in regional or political viewpoints. This principle goes unspoken in the film. How could it possibly be articulated? We would find ourselves sleeping with the enemy. But the message is there, covert as it is. There isn't a truly sympathetic male in the movie. Harvey Keitel is a relatively benign authority figure, but he is distant and powerless to do do anything other than his duty, which is evidently to put them in a position where they feel they need to turn into part of the scenery. Michael Madsen tries to be understanding and helpful but -- MICHAEL MADSEN? (How about Timothy Carey?) His looks, his demeanor, lightly rasping voice, his smoking, belie his dialogue. We recognize the face of the beast when we see it. That's why Costa-Gavras was nailed by critics for casting the sympathetic looking Yves Montand as a CIA-sponsored torture instructor in ""State of Siege"". The husband is a stereotypical idiotic patriarchal male. A hitch-hiker, smooth and apologetic and cute, turns out to be a thieving moral idiot when his glands are satisfied. A would-be rapist is a greasy gargoyle. A truck driver is something out of the barroom scene in ""Star Wars."" The flaw lies not so much in the movie, which is filled with breezy chatter and is exhilarating, and not in the script either. The deeply disturbing aspect of this motion-picture event is the audience's and the critic's response to it. What -- ultimately -- is there to applaud about a movie that tells us that the two genders are by nature or by fate enemies of one another. That one is oppressed and exploited by the other? And that the resolution of the conflict lies not in negotiation but suicide? If that were true, there would be no audience around to clap when Thelma and Louise do their joint nosedive. Yes, it has brio and leaves you feeling amused and happy most of the time, but it leaves a sour taste afterward. In the end this is a tragedy, not the comedy it was meant to be.",Thelma & Louise
10,moonspinner55,"Despite some fundamental weaknesses, it has really held up over time...",7,29 January 2006,"Two accidental female fugitives elude the police while attempting to drive across the Southwest to Mexico. Filmmaker Ridley Scott shows a terrific talent for directing women here, and the performances by Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis are almost uncanny. One can hardly believe that these two haven't been friends for years, their give and take seems so lived in. Salty waitress Sarandon, initially the savvier of the two, is loose and girlie with Arkansas housewife Davis in the beginning; however, their character shadings soon change, with both ladies eventually taking turns playing 'the brains' (I didn't really believe it when, having been pulled over by a cop in the desert, Sarandon's Louise becomes kind of a dingbat, but you accept it for the moment and the movie quickly rolls on). The men in the cast obviously don't get much of a chance to shine, but Harvey Keitel does the understanding detective bit very well (it's almost the same man he portrayed in ""Mortal Thoughts""); Brad Pitt has a scene-stealing, star-making role as a cowboy hustler, yet this film took a long time to gain a fully appreciative audience. It did modest business and garnered Oscar nominations for the ladies, but only afterward did it take on some resonance (it's now viewed as a feminist statement and has a loyal following among lesbian audiences). It creaks a little, and the twangy main theme gives way to a ridiculously melodramatic score, but the narrative is so tight and the women are so good that it keeps you watching--and returning. *** from ****",Thelma & Louise
11,Quinoa1984,"part entertaining road movie, part decent Lifetime-channel movie, good acting all around",7,14 July 2008,"Thelma and Louise was director Ridley Scott's attempt to step out of his perceived 'box' of sorts- that he was mostly known for sci-fi/action pictures- for something more character-driven. This goes without saying that Thelma and Louise has its moments of big action and chases and even a HUGE explosion at one point late in the story. But for what Scott was going for, he accomplished his goals of making a good, character-driven story. If the movie may ultimately appeal to some more than others (i.e. women), then perhaps that's more-so by design of the screenwriter, Calie Kohouri, than the director who tries often to deliver in whatever form a blockbuster again and again.Some of the decisions and little twists may seem absurd or silly. Hence the likely connection to be made to a Lifetime TV movie. Granted, there are stretches that don't go for the kind of wretched sentimentality of those tearjerkers and soppy things. And the ending, however iconic so many years later, veers near being over-the-top. But luckily the script has a lot of inspired bits and characters, and every part is cast well, or surprisingly so. Granted, the male parts (Keitel, Madsen, McDonald, newcomer Pitt) are fit like gloves, which are the detective, the low-rent boyfriend, the sleazy husband and the hot hunk of feminine fantasy flesh respectively. Davis and Sarandon, on the other hand, are a really great pairing, with Davis delivering one of her best (however sometimes limited) and Sarandon totally in a commanding turn.Maybe not the modern-day classic some may call it, and as a ""statement"" on the feminist condition it's in equal terms bleak and sweet and ludicrous. As a cool Hollywood road movie, there's been a helluva lot worse, or more contrived.",Thelma & Louise
12,sunwarrior13,Feminist Road And Buddy Film,10,26 October 2011,"Thelma & Louise is a film co-produced and directed by Ridley Scott and written by first-time scriptwriter Callie Khouri in her Oscar winning screenplay.It stars Geena Davis as Thelma and Susan Sarandon as Louise, together with Harvey Keitel,Michael Madsen, and Brad Pitt in one of his first significant film roles.The film's plot revolves around Thelma and Louise's escape from their troubled and caged lives.Thelma,played by Geena Davis, is married to Darryl who likes his wife to stay quiet in the kitchen so that he can watch football on TV.Louise,played by Sarandon, is working in a fast food restaurant as a waitress and has some problems with her friend Jimmy, who, as a musician, is always on the road. One day they decide to break out of their normal life and jump in the car and hit the road.However, their journey turns into an escape when Louise accidentally kills a man who threatens to rape Thelma. They decide to go to Mexico, but soon they are hunted by the police.The road and buddy movie that is different as it is original and refreshing in the sense that women are the lead characters.It shows how two women on the road achieve growth and independence as they learn more about each other and themselves.Aside from that,we also get enjoy their adventures as they meet different characters and personalities on the road.And finally,this is a definitely a picture that has feminism as one of its primary themes.The performances of Davis and Sarandon were spectacular in this film as they have provided energy and vibrancy in the portrayals of their roles. Scott's direction is also great as he was able to show that he can make great character study films with a balance of action,drama and comedy.And worthy of the mention is the cinematography as we see the dazzling visuals in the background. Overall,this is one of the best buddy and road film ever made.",Thelma & Louise

14,Theo Robertson,Has Its Moments ....,5,17 November 2003,".... But at the end of the day THELMA AND LOUISE is a chick flick road movie that strikes a chord with women so it`s difficult for a man , especially a cynical hetrosexist one like myself to empathise with . I couldn`t help noticing how routinely Ridley Scott directs this movie , it`s not badly directed and unlike a lot of other Scott movies he concentrates on directing his actors , but compare the visuals in this to movies like ALIEN , BLADE RUNNER , GLADIATOR and BLACK HAWK DOWN and you`ll notice apart from the very end there`s little imagery involved",Thelma & Louise
15,lastliberal,Dow the road and over the hill we go.,9,24 March 2007,"Out of 21 nomination, this film pulled 12 wins. An impressive total for what was a superbly written tale of two women who just want to go off on an adventure. Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis were remarkable in their roles as girls who just wanted to have fun and get away from the strict confines of daily life. Who among us doesn't desire the same thing? Things go wrong, the meet a jerk (brad Pitt), and they can't go back to normal. That's when it really gets interesting and fun. I never tire of this film and watch it over and over. It is an outstanding feminist caper that shows the importance of bonding and friendship. It was also a welcome variation on the standard road picture or the usual male-dominated buddy flick.",Thelma & Louise
16,zardoz-13,The First and Best Female Buddy Picture Ever!!!,10,5 January 2009,"The firestorm of controversy that erupted over the release of ""Thelma & Louise"" took British director Ridley Scott, first-time scenarist Callie Khouri, and principal co-stars Susan Sarandon & Geena Davis entirely by surprise. Men and women on both sides of the issue whether feminist activists or otherwise weighed in on the combustible argument. Some said it degraded men, and other heralded it as a testosterone-laced female manifesto, while still others ""Time"" magazine critic Richard Schickel devoted three pages to the ""white-hot debate"" seething ""over whether Thelma & Louise"" celebrated ""liberated females, male bashersor outlaws."" Schickel concluded that Scott's film possessed ""a curiously unselfconscious manner about it, an air of not being completely aware of its own subtexts or largest intentions, of being innocently open to interpretation, appropriate and otherwise."" Moreover, Schickel went on to say that its ""makers, without quite knowing what they were doing, sank a drill into what appeared to be familiar American soil and found that they had somehow tapped into a wild-rushing subterranean stream of inchoate outrage and deranged violence. Indeed, when Scott decided to helm ""Thelma & Louise,"" he wanted to ""raise this film from being about two girls in a car to something with a little bit more of a statement."" As for Khouri, she reacted to the male bashing assertions as ""shocking."" Nevertheless, this gender bending controversy didn't harm the box office. Budgeted at $6.5 million, ""Thelma & Louise"" generated $20 million in revenues in less than a month and eventually grossed $45 million. Ironically, despite its notoriety, Khouri noted later that ""Thelma & Louise"" didn't open up more roles for women.Fed-up coffee shop waitress Louise Sawyer (Susan Sarandon of ""The Rocky Horror Picture Show"") and her claustrophobic housewife friend Thelma Dickerson (Geena Davis of ""Beetle Juice"") plan a weekend fishing trip. Louise has an on-again, off-again romance with a sweet-hearted musician boyfriend, Jimmy (Michael Madsen of ""Reservoir Dogs""), who suffers from a commitment phobia. Meanwhile, Thelma contends with a domineering husband, carpet salesman Darryl (Christopher McDonald of ""Grease 2""), who keeps her on a short leash. These gal pals load up Louise's 1966 T-Bird convertible and paranoid-minded Thelma packs a gun. Our heroines don't get very far before they slake their thirst at a country & western roadhouse with a band and dance floor. Thelma flirts with a charismatic redneck, Harlan (Timothy Carhart of ""Witness""), who winds up assaulting her in the parking lot. Louise saves her girlfriend before Harlan can sodomize Thelma. Momentarily, everybody backs off in an uneasy truce. What we don't learn about until later is Louise has concealed an incident in her past that she has never resolved. When the would-be rapist insults Louise with a derogatory dog reference, she shoots him dead cold dead on the spot without a qualm. Our heroines hightail it without a second thought.Thelma insists that a jury would blame her for enticing Harlan with her flirtatious manner and provocative apparel. As fugitives on the lam, our protagonists embark on a cross-country journey through Oklahoma and New Mexico, carefully avoiding Texas, for the sanctuary of Mexico. Everything goes awry when they pick up a sexy, Stetson-wearing, denim-clad hitchhiker, J.D. (Brad Pitt of ""True Romance""), who steals their money when Thelma has her mind on his hunky physique. At this point, Louise relinquishes her role as the stern mother figure and Thelmawho had been in the daughter figure roletakes it over. Since they have no money, Thelma decides to put into practice J.D.'s formula for robbing convenience stores to use and holds up a grocery store. Darryl is shocked when the FBI shows him the videotape of the robbery.Thelma and Louise's odyssey of liberation turns into a tragic manhunt in the tradition of the modern-day Kirk Douglas western ""Lonely Are the Brave"" (1962) where a lone cowboy is chased by cars and helicopters across the wilderness. Eventually, a posse of heavily armed lawmen, among them a sympathetic Arkansas State Police investigator, Hal Slocumbe (Harvey Keitel of ""Mean Streets""), who has tried to reason with them, corners them at the equivalent of the Grand Canyon. Rather that capitulating to justice and inevitable jail time, our heroines refuse to surrender. Literally, they take flight, launch themselves off a cliff, and plunge their car into the oblivion of a canyon and certain death. We never actually see them die. Scott concludes this larger-than-life epic on a freeze frame of the protagonists soaring through air in their automobile, reminiscent of George Roy Hill's memorable freeze frame at the end of ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" when the heroes charge an army of soldiers. Appropriating the male bonding movie formula, ""Thelma & Louise"" reversed its sexuality so that women rather than men bonded, shared life-altering experiences, and savored a taste of freedom that neither sought to forsake despite the consequences. Previously, the buddy picture had been exclusive domain of men with examples such as ""Thunderbolt & Lightfoot,"" ""Smokey and the Bandit,"" ""The Sting,"" and ""Easy Rider."" Scott's film, however, irrevocably changed the landscape, and nothing comparable to ""Thelma & Louise"" has been produced. Previously, Scott had made a pioneering foray into feminism with ""Alien"" (1986) when he cast Sigourney Weaver as the survivor. ""Thelma & Louise"" emerged as a cautionary tale about what can happen when men refuse to treat women with respect. Callie Khouri not only won the Oscar but also a Golden Globe for Best Screenplay. Sarandon and Davis received Best Actress Oscar nominations as well as Golden Globe nods for their performances. Ridley Scott received a Best Director nomination for the Oscar as well as the César--French equivalent of the Oscar. Amid all of the kudos for Khouri, Sarandon, Davis, and Scott, the most overlooked person in ""Thelma & Louise"" is actor Christopher McDonald who steals the show with his hilarious performance as Darryl, much of which wasaccording to Scottimprovised by McDonald on the set.",Thelma & Louise
17,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Drive,8,1 December 2009,"Scott proves again what a diverse and skillful director he is, by taking on yet another genre different from those he has dealt with before, and masters it, as he has those he worked in before. While this is one of the only road-movies I've seen, it is definitely the best. It follows two women that finally fight back against the crude, nasty and foul-mouthed men that have always held them back. The film does not take a stance on their actions, it merely displays them, leaving it up to the audience to judge(though without leaving any doubt as to the fact that they are in reaction to the continued abuse that they have suffered). You might perceive the plot as simple, but it comments a lot on the environment and the types you meet in this. It's well-told, and the pacing is excellent. The acting is marvelous, there's not a single performance that is off. Even Pitt, in the role that got him noticed, is spot-on. Davis contributes enthusiasm and warmth, and Sarandon convinces as being a more reserved person. The characters are well-written, fleshed out and credible. I must compliment Zimmer on his effective score, which helps this be immensely engaging. There is mild violence and sexuality(with a little nudity), infrequent strong language and some disturbing content in this. The DVD comes with a couple of trailers and an informational commentary track by Ridley, and you can also choose to hear his thoughts on the interesting enough alternate ending included. I recommend this to any fan of anyone who helped make this, as well as all feminists. 8/10",Thelma & Louise
18,view_and_review,"In for a penny, in for a pound",6,25 February 2020,"Sometimes in life you get to a point where there is no turning back. The point of no return is hardly, if ever, a good thing. Thelma and Louise got to a point of no return. They'd gotten so deep into the ugly situation they were in that they almost had not choice but to just keep going forward.To understand Thelma and Louise is to understand ""Thelma & Louise"" the movie.
Thelma (Geena Davis) was a much maligned housewife married to Darryl (Christopher McDonald). She has been mentally and emotionally stunted by her relationship with Darryl. The relationship is more akin to father and daughter than husband and wife. Louise (Susan Sarandon) is the opposite of Thelma. She is single, tough, and largely independent.After Louise kills a man that attempts to rape Thelma they go on the lam. Louise seems all too informed about the fact that the shooting will not be considered self-defense. Thelma's luck with men wouldn't get any better. She hooks up with a hitchhiker named J.D. (Brad Pitt) who ends up stealing all of their money.It becomes readily apparent that Thelma is almost childlike in her ignorance and/or innocence. Not a full 24 hours after being attacked by a man she met at a bar she had a one-night-stand with a man who robs her; not to mention she also confided in him her plans to escape to Mexico. It's clear that Thelma's greatest sin wasn't her infidelity but her simple nature. As long as she was married she could afford to be simple, but once she was out in the world her simpleness--or more derogatorily--her simple-mindedness was a trait she could ill-afford.Whereas ostensibly this was an empowering movie about fighting back and taking control, it was also a disturbing movie signaling that should a woman fight back things will spiral out of control.",Thelma & Louise
19,evanston_dad,"Girl Power, Ridley Scott Style",5,18 November 2008,"The critical scene in ""Thelma & Louise,"" and the one I think the screenplay got most wrong, is the one in which Thelma (Susan Sarandon) interrupts an attempted rape of her friend, Louise (Geena Davis), in a bar parking lot. The attack is over, the women are walking away, and the attacker calls Thelma something (I forget what), after which she turns around and shoots him. The way the scene plays out, ""Thelma & Louise"" could have been an interesting movie, putting the audience in a quandary. The sympathy we're obviously supposed to feel for them would struggle with our desire to see Thelma and Louise face the consequences of their decisions. But the film doesn't go that route. Instead, it drags out a cliché back story for Thelma involving a past rape, so that we have an easy and tidy way to justify away her sociopathic behavior. This removes responsibility from the women, takes choices away from them and presents them to us as victims of an uncaring society. A most UN-feminist viewpoint, if you ask me. Still, Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis give two superb performances as the women on the run, and director Ridley Scott always knows how to keep a story moving. The male characters aren't worth mentioning, since the screenplay treats them as disposable. I guess since they were making a ""feminist"" movie, the filmmakers thought that they couldn't possibly have a positive image of a male character without somehow weakening their point. I sincerely hope those interested in truly feminist works of art expect more from them than this film has to offer.Grade: C+",Thelma & Louise

Brad Pitt plays a cowboy drifter while Michael Madsen and Christopher McDonald are on hand as the beau and hubby of the women.""Thelma & Louise"" (1991) is an iconic crime drama/road movie spiced with a few thrills. It's entertaining, but not really empowering for females, unless making rash, stupid decisions and ruining your life is empowering. It's amusing, dramatic and scenic, yet ultimately tragic.Sarandon was 41 during shooting while Davis was ten years younger. Both look great, but their characters are a bit of a turn-off during the opening reel, especially the ditzy Thelma (Davis), yet they win sympathy as the movie progresses.The film runs 2 hours, 10 minutes, and was shot in Southern Cal and Utah, as well as Bedrock, Colorado.GRADE: B",Thelma & Louise
21,Mr-Fusion,"You probably already know the ending, but it's still a ride worth taking",7,30 June 2015,"""Thelma & Louise"" makes for one of your better road movies (to say the least), but the real jewel in this crown is the heavy-duty bond between these two women. Both are well cast and they play off of each other well, but they're layered characters, and the story grows ever more interesting the deeper in trouble they find themselves. Their thirst for freedom is what really lends this movie its impact. There's en undeniable feminist streak running through this film - an outlaw awakening - but what's nice is that the message doesn't usurp the entertainment. It's not such a cut-and-dried ""men are sleaze"" platform (Keitel and Madsen are sympathetic males). This is really a buddy movie at heart.And a good one.7/10",Thelma & Louise

To me, I never really enjoyed ""Thelma and Louise"". It's a little bit too much of the whole ""girl power"" gig. Not that Thelma and Louise aren't cool. I actually compare their friendship to my friendship with my best friend. We love each other to death, and would probably end up being fugitives together. That's how close we are. But for the movie, it's alright. Even though there are some memorable moments, it just didn't do it for me. But I do think the girls will enjoy the young Brad Pitt.

In protecting Thelma, Louise shoots crook Harlan (Timothy Carhart) for attempting to rape Thelma. Due to the incriminating circumstances, Thelma and Louise attempt to escape from the pursuing authorities.Callie Khouri's Oscar-winning story provided a lot of excitement and thrills for this countryside-setting movie, making the audience captivated by the endurance and perseverance of Thelma and Louise as they banded together to deal with the overwhelming odds against them and rediscovering the strength of their friendship.

24,thesar-2,The Wonderful MisAdventures of Thelma & Louise,10,1 July 2010,"This movie was, indeed, fantastic. It's no wonder that BOTH Geena Davis (Thelma) and Susan Sarandon (Louise) got nominated for the Best Actress Oscar. Though it's unfortunate that both lose, in this special case, that's completely acceptable for two solid reasons: Jodie Foster, who won her second Oscar for The Silence of the Lambs rightfully won for the role of her life and that it would enormously hard to decide between the two ladies of Thelma & Louise – they were both EXCELLENT.I want to make something clear from before: this is NOT a chick-flick. And this is NOT Bonnie & Clyde. This is a movie of two going nowhere ladies who finally put their hair down for a weekend away – but run into an enormous series of unfortunate events. It's a story of justice, injustice, survival, redemption, saviors, trust, love, bonding and non-sexual life partners. In reference to the ""Bonnie & Clyde"" remarks I've heard attached to this movie, I have two words: Phooey! B&C planned things out..our T&L heroes reacted to their environment to survive, rarely (until the final quarter) were their ""bad deeds"" intentional or maliciously.Oh, and I've heard that this movie is a man-hating film filled with vengeful, dare I?, bitches. For that, I have four words: Go to hell. These girls were mistreated, viciously at times, by males, yes, but they did not seek out revenge on them – they wanted to be free of them. Free of pain, solitude, abandonment, rudeness and abuse – mentally, physically and sexually. They had NOTHING against all men, but if you put such redneck, back wooded, narrow/simple minded fellas in front of thembe somewhere else.Louise is neat and straight-laced. She's a waitress, which might seem dead-end, but she's thoroughly content. Thelma is high-strung, a child in a woman's body and trapped (settled) herself in a loveless and abusive marriage. Louise's plan is to get away for the weekend and take her BFF to a cabin to have some wild nights. Thelma, of course wants to go, but is worried about controlling husband Darryl (McDonald) saying no. Taking a chance – one that will change everyone's life, soon – she agrees and slips away while he's at work.Justifiably antsy – she practically forces prudish (with reason; sit back to watch the layers unravel and discover why) Louise to stop at a honky tonk. Unable to contain herself, even for seconds, Thelma overindulges in alcohol and becomes victim to a regular's, Harlan (Carhart), unwanted advances. In comes Louise to the rescue while stripping one layer on her current way of life.And that's all I'm revealing and that all takes place in the first, say 20 minutes with another 110 to go. Discover the magic all on your own. See the incredible depth of both Sarandon and Davis. I couldn't even begin to describe how well they preformed. Though I loved (for once – meaning, I have liked her a lot in the past, but here it was genuine love) Davis's performance, it was Sarandon that shot to the top of my favorite actresses at the time. If you could not feel her angst, if you could not see Louise was alive and aware and weary of the future and her mental breakdown of the walls she put up – youareblind.Each time I watch this movie, I pick up on something new. Perhaps, I did see it before – but it's always fun to experience such greatness for the first time, more than once – but in this viewing, there's a beautiful and dramatic scene of Louise standing alone in the dark desert surrounded by complete silence. The sun is rising. I have a feeling she wanted to see the sun rise for the final time as she felt she was tired, so tired. Not just of running, but maintaining the wall she built. Maybe she wanted to experience God's gift, but I'm going with my first theory.Did I mention beyond the wonderful depth of the characters – ones that will be etched in my mind with warm memories until I die – there was an excellent soundtrack (one I have listened to literally hundreds of times, and I really don't favor country at all) and a beautifully mournful score, suburb cinematography – even though I hate the desert, they made it magical, and it had a PERFECT blend of comedic tones mixed with serious moments. These types of moments, I've experienced myself. I've been through some extreme times in my life, and instead of blankly crying about it, which was hard to hold back, I had to make some loud joke and laugh until I did finally cry. There's a beautiful scene, where you think its set up for Thelma to joke/crack up and she laughs her ass off and mimics the gun sound (BANG!) that came from the weapon Louise used to kill a man, not so long prior. Louise doesn't find this funny one bit, in which Thelma agrees. It isn't. But what are you going to do? How are you going to handle it? These are scenes, some small and subtle, some larger, that are real life. Director Scott and the leads captured this with nothing less than perfection.Despite its minor and I mean very, very few, flaws, such as how quick the Keitel character both tracked them but kept up with them (believable in 2010, but I don't think so in 1991) and some over-the-top clichéd characters floating around – making it easy for our heroes to hate and disseminate, the greatness in this movie pushes it straight to the top of my rating board and directly into my top ten of all time films.Watch it. Experience it. Love it. Learn something about how films should be shot, how acting should be taught and perhaps, about yourself.",Thelma & Louise
25,ElMaruecan82,Damsels Not in Distress Anymore...,9,18 April 2017,"Somebody said get a life so they did. ""They"" refer to 90's icons Thelma Dickinson (Geena Davis) and Louise Sawyer (Suran Sarandon), an aging waitress and a 'desperate housewife' before a series would turn the term into some cocktail-drinking gossipy upper-class girls.They get a life indeed but what the tag-line doesn't say is that they get death too. But what an extra after the two-day ride they had, many people live without actually living, these two women pushed the notion of being free to its most extreme form, and when they decide to take the big jump, we're taken by many contradicting sentiments but one of them isn't disbelief because Sarandon and Davis gave life to two extraordinary persons who found themselves. I never really got why the American Film Institute nominated them in the Top 50 heroes' list, but a last viewing convinced me, the final sacrifice sealed their status as cinematic icons.But aside from the existential aspect of the film which, like the best road movies, focuses on the journey rather than the destination, there's the performances. Lesser acting, more clichés or directing à la pseudo-rebellious 2010's way would have ruined the film. Indeed, if there's anything ""Thelma and Louise"" exemplifies is how low feminism has sunk today by making everything a matter of ""being like men"" well this is exactly what Ridley Scott's film is not (but he's a man, so what does he know?) The fashion of gender-oriented movies today is to prove that women are as much capable of men but thankfully we don't need a female cop or a female truck driver for the film, we have pretty well-established archetypes, only this time, they're explored from a female standpoint.The waitress isn't just here to cheer up the depressed visitors, she gives her personal insights about the rapist and her lack of surprise that he ended up being shot reveals how much of human nature she knows. Now, a word about the rapist, at first he's your usual womanizer and Thelma is obviously responsive to his charm, but we're not fooled, it's not his talk but the fact that he seemed to care for her, to be sensitive. Thelma left her door wide open so when she was caught in the trap, it was too late, he couldn't believe a woman who gave herself so easily was suddenly playing 'hard to get', that's why he was totally deaf to her cries and pleas until Louise's gun made him come to his senses. Still; why would he sign his own death warrant by letting these last words slip off his mouth.That's the key, he didn't anticipate a reaction. This is a man who had such a low perception of women that in no way he felt endangered, and that was Louise's epiphany. Obviously, raping is the most cowardly and bestial way to assert male power, in the physical way, Louise knew that and saw her friend in state of helplessness, if even the gun didn't insert some sense in his mind, then he would do the same thing again. So she killed him and she didn't feel happy about it. This is the hit-or-miss moment of the film but it works because Sarandon puts so much truth in her acting that you can almost feel some intern brainstorm at that very moment. Was she right or not? Never mind, she did what he expected the least, and involuntarily setting the pattern for the next moves.This is what the ending is about too, this is what everything is about: unpredictability, it starts with two women going fishing, then they must flee to Mexico, then circumstances force them to derail their road, a young Brad Pitt also manages to lure naive Thelma in his net and steal the money, forcing them to rely on a robbery, and then the encounter with a young cop makes them commit an irreparable offense and force them to leave a state and blow their cover. But these scenes aren't just time fillers, they allow one character to finally blossom: Thelma stops being that naive Southern housewife who falls for the first schmuck to a natural gun-wielder and a crazy confident girl who neutralizes the ultimate macho symbol, a cop, and makes him weep like a ballerina.I don't feel like polluting this review by mentioning the recent ""Ghostbusters"" movie but the equivalent of a ""Thelma and Louise"" today would show female truck drivers acting the same toward men instead of women giving a lesson of decency, we wouldn't have comprehensive men like Louise's boyfriend played by Michael Madsen or the cop played by Harvey Keitel, all the guys would've been as rude as Thelma's husband (Christopher McDonald) wimpy as the cop or disgusting like the truck driver, and Louise would be a lesbian, nothing wrong with that of course, but the point is to show that they had nothing against men in the first place. But that today's audience consider a film like ""Ghostbusters"" feminist is an insult to real feminism, like ""Thelma and Louise"", a film that doesn't say that women are ""little things"" but that it's the way men look at them and it's up to them to make a difference by acting ""big"" which doesn't mean, acting like ""men"".It's one extreme case of course but a real staple on empowering movies, an instant classic that was parodied a few years after its release in ""The Simpsons"" or ""Wayne's World"", that's the mark of iconic movies. When I was kid, I stopped watching it after an hour because the ad on TV made me believe it was a fun movie, it just got too dark after the rape, the killing and the robbery it took me some time to re-watch it, but I think I always knew there was something special about this film.",Thelma & Louise
26,ThomasDrufke,Selfies,8,13 May 2015,"Being such an iconic film and a poster film for strong female characters, I was glad to see that Thelma & Louise was a great film after all. With plenty of great performances, one killer and unique Hans Zimmer soundtrack, and a road trip for the century, Thelma & Louise is definitely one of the defining films of the 90's and of the past half century. Not to mention the fact that it has one of the most, if not the most iconic selfie of all time. I'm pretty sure they started it all. Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon star as two women who want to temporarily escape their simplistic lives and get away for a weekend. When one of them has a little too much fun, chaos ensues and suddenly they are fugitives.I don't think it's a problem to draw comparisons to other buddy films, but make no mistake, this isn't your prototypical buddy film, there is plenty of harsh realism on display. Our protagonists aren't your clichéd heroes that do no wrong. Thelma and Louise both do plenty of wrong, and guess what, it actually takes a toll on them. We don't find them blinded by the lifestyle, although they do have quite a lot of fun, but all of it impacts them significantly. Often we see tears and stress hinder their ability to keep driving, but they had no choice. I think it was great that this film not only gave us great characters, but it also played on the stereotypes and gender issues we have today. The reality is that a lot of people wouldn't believe that Thelma was being raped. It happens oh too often still to this day nearly 25 years ago. It's hard to imagine a time when women are finally treated the same as men, but hopefully one day.I also really enjoyed the performances of Brad Pitt and Michael Madsen. For Pitt, it was early on in his career, and he was no doubt doing a completely different role. I'm pretty sure it was the beginning of the Pitt madness of the 90's, but I thought this was more a showcase of his acting talent than anything else. Of course, he also served the role of duping the girls at one point, but I was glad to see in the end, the girls weren't really duped so much as they were let free. The last shot of the film, although definitely controversial, to me was a symbol of just being free to make your own choices. These two women were sick and tired of being controlled and told what to do from their husbands, and this road trip served as a getaway not just for the weekend, but for good. The only real problem I have with the movie was at times I felt the balance between drama and comedy was shaky. I know it can be a satire, but I almost would have liked a more straight drama with comedy sprinkled in then a balance of the two. Don't get me wrong though, this film is quite the ride.+Strong female leads +Their actions take a toll on them +Realistic characters +Pitt & Madsen's supporting roles -Too much comedy at times8.3/10",Thelma & Louise

The rape that Sarandon's character carries inside her for the rest of her life. The abusive, self-important, controlling husband. The ridiculous harassment out on the road. The film went from 0 to dark mighty quickly out in that parking lot, which is an extraordinary moment. Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon are brilliant in this, and Brad Pitt's breakout role is memorable as well. The film goes a little awry at times e.g. The Jamaican bicyclist smoking pot (ugh), but it shines in its quieter moments, such as when Sarandon's character catches the eye of two old women looking despondently out the window.

It was nominated for six Academy Awards and it is one of only four films with two nominations for the best actress in a leading role, but the Oscars were taken away by objectively better ""The Silence of the Lambs"". Fortunately, the script for ""The Lambs"" is an adaptation of a novel, so ""Thelma & Louise"" could win the Oscar for the best original screenplay.The movie tells the story of two oppressed women from the lower middle class, who embark on a weekend in the countryside, but under unfortunate circumstances become refugees before the law. They committed a crime by an accident, but once they felt liberated from their miserable lives, something in them snapped, and for them, there was no turning back. In the movie we encounter the disempowerment of a woman in marriage, subordination to a man, rape, lethargy, unfairness of the legal system, power of friendship, thirst for freedom, ... but although most of the subjects only briefly pass through the film, all are pretty strongly presented. Characterization of our heroines is fantastic and Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis, in my opinion, achieved their life roles. The other characters are not particularly developed, but they are interesting enough and with an excellent selection of actors greatly contribute to the general impression. There are Harvey Keitel in the role of a good-willed cop, Michael Madsen in the role of Louise's boyfriend and, extremely unusual, probably the most sane and likable character in the film, and Brad Pit in the role of a petty criminal and rogue who will push Thelma over the edge.In just two hours you'll get believable characters with strong backstories and even better development during the film, wide specter of relationships, entertaining road-trip adventure, a well-measured dose of quality humor, and the extremely emotional finale you won't ever forget.

33,johnnyboyz,Certainly one of the most memorable 'road movies' of all time.,7,26 March 2007,"'Thelma & Louise' is another directorial effort by, now, well known director Ridley Scott. Although you can't go back to this film and state that it was too near the beginning of his career to warrant any criticism (He'd already done 'Alien' and 'Blade Runner'), I got the feeling you don't have to as it manages to stand tall all by itself.A few days after seeing Thelma & Louise, I slowly began to realise how much it broke away from typical Hollywood storytelling. Although this is, after all, a 'road movie'; that didn't detract from the eerie realisation I started to feel when I realised this film carried certain neo-realistic qualities. What that means is that it emphasises the everyday and unspectacular; a feeling I certainly got once they were deep into the middle of the desert during which the film hits a segment of pure unpredictability, in a very entertaining way. The acting talent is also pretty close to un heard of with Michael Madsen, Brad Pitt and Geena Davis all still relatively unknown in Hollywood; how quaint then that the two heavy weights of Keitel and Sarandon do most of the bantering when things get really tight and whilst the 'unknowns' of Pitt and Davis develop their own relationship.The film is suspenseful, but suspenseful in its own unique way. Little battles, problems and dilemmas the two women face along their journey are dealt with in an entertaining, if not unspectacular and often logistical way but it doesn't detract. What adds to this unpredictability are the little love stories that open up about a third of the way in. The character of Louise (Davis) is developing the whole time as friendship/love relations with another man other than her obnoxious husband open up; not only advancing the character in a satisfying way but also paving the way for the next event to occur that kick-starts their adventure once again.What's more, as each situation that comes along (The meeting of J.D. (Pitt), the fact they loose all their money and have to do something about it and the interaction with the state trooper; to name a few) the better it gets. The two women grow in their confidence and ruthlessness whilst the scenarios grow more and more intense. The reactions of the two women to these scenarios also escalates to the point that they do something so extreme; it threatens their lives.With plenty of things going for it, the film almost seems scared to veer too far away from its roots. The overuse of cheery music of the pop and country variety adds to my theory that the director wanted to keep everything fairly light-hearted. As each desperate situation occurs, I feel less of the light music and more of a darker decent shown by the two women would have suited the film much more. Alas, the film remains in its 'happy' state and the closing montage before the credits signalling the 'best bits' from the film/the two character's relationship only adds to my point.Ridley Scott had Sigourney Weaver defying female film stereo-types in Alien as she went around saving the day and acting as the hero/focus; in Thelma & Louise we have an equally good example of that from the same director, only this time there are two.",Thelma & Louise

35,Movie_Muse_Reviews,Two iconic characters justify women finally calling the shots,8,4 September 2009,"Call it a chick flick, call it aggressive feminism, label it whatever you like, but ""Thelma & Louise"" is a classic story of female companionship and liberation that challenged what was and in many ways still is a male-centric movie industry. Roles for women in film have expanded over the years, but Thelma and Louise proved women can even be outlaws starring in a fugitive adventure thriller.Societal messages aside, however, it doesn't change the fact that Callie Khouri wrote a fantastic character-driven script with unexpected twists and turns and an unforeseeable ending. ""Thelma & Louise"" might be far from a blood-pumping fugitive crime thriller, but action and excitement is not what this film hangs its hat on.Even director Ridley Scott, who directed probably the greatest suspense movie with a female lead of all time in ""Alien,"" recognizes that ""Thelma & Louise"" is relationship drama at its heart as two women discover themselves as they push each other over the edge.Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon star as the titular characters, one a suppressed housewife and another a chain-smoking waitress who plan a weekend getaway together only to end up trying to get away from the authorities after Louise shoots a man at a bar who tried to rape Thelma. After deciding there's no way to come clean of their crime, they run for the Mexico border as authorities (led by Harvey Keitel) try and track them down.Davis and Sarandon are an incredible duo playing the most detailed of characters. Davis as Thelma is the best of the two as she takes Thelma through a complete transformation from warm, acquiescent housewife looking to let loose to a fully committed armed criminal. Sarandon plays Louise as a colder, self-assured type who learns that she really doesn't have it all together. The two work in perfect balance creating strong, relatable and fascinating characters whose flaws make them so human.Not much has to be said for Scott's directing, he gives these characters the attention they need to blossom before us and does just enough to keep us guessing when they'll do some sudden and unpredictable.Yes, in this process of self-discovery, the girls both literally and symbolically give the middle finger to the male establishment. From shooting the abusive trickster that attempted to rape Thelma to Louise turning away her boyfriend (Michael Madsen) after he finds her and proposes to her, there's little sympathy for the male characters. Only Keitel's detective gets Khouri's vote as he defends the ladies (despite wanting to catch them) when a young Brad Pitt gets mixed up with them. Some of it might seem unnecessary such as the trucker who makes crude gestures to them along the highway, but considering Hollywood's abuse of the femme fatale, innocent girl and other female thriller/adventure genre archetypes, I'd say it's a fair trade, especially when these characters are actually very thoughtfully conceived. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com",Thelma & Louise
36,jzappa,"""You said you and me was gonna get outta town and for once just really let our hair down. Well darlin', look out 'cause my hair is comin' down!""",8,13 October 2010,"Thelma & Louise was made around the time when Ridley Scott, a foremost visual stylist, trendsetter of cyberpunk and atmospheric epics, was beginning to make films with contemporary settings to prove his capability of producing good work without the aid of special effects. It reveals the perceived untapped talent of Scott for high-spirited humor and pulsating American visuals. He reimagines the buddy film with such novelty and vitality that the genre gives an absolutely fresh impression. He discovered unforeseen assets within both of its stars, Sarandon and Davis, who are artlessly paired as the lively and unique title characters.Thelma & Louise also seemed to come at a time when Hollywood liked hard-hitting social conflict in the form of epic journeys through the country...Wild at Heart, Kalifornia, Natural Born Killers. Since the earliest movies, train travel was a popular motif, due to cinema's fascination with movement. When cars and motorbikes became more widespread, movement could be intimately connected with a character's individual development, and from the 1940s onwards, outsiders were continually portrayed as motorized nomads. Similar to the western, the road movie generally concentrates on solitary men who only feel free if they're in constant and restless movement.This classic picture is the version of that genre that either hadn't been made yet or in a way that reached people. Its central voyagers are renegades from an oppressive, male-dominated culture. They become intoxicated with freedom from double standards, fragile egos that must be gratified at the expense of their personal feelings, meaningless tradition, that they defy any and every rule they find themselves theoretically or practically confronting. From our introduction to this meek, submissive housewife and struggling waitress to their evolution to heat-packing fugitives impulsively destroying gas trucks, we've witnessed an epic journey in some sense on par with Ridley's literal epics. Increasingly more desperate, yet increasingly less confined, they show their true primal colors and awaken to themselves. One of them encapsulates it quite well in her own predisposed context: ""You've always been crazy, this is just the first chance you've had to express yourself.""The film develops a double perspective. The first follows the two best friends, who become more daring, more independent and less tolerant with every obstacle that crosses their path. Thelma begins to get the hang of being free and getting her own way. She locks a policeman into his own trunk at gunpoint when he tries to arrest them, and then blows up a petrol tanker when the driver directs a stream of sexist comments at them as he drives by. The second perspective shows the police investigations. Detective Slocumb's a sensitive cop who suspects the truth and tries to mediate, but he's powerless to stop the machinery of the FBI once it begins to roll. Frankly, this just seems like a point-counterpoint argument, where the filmmakers feel compelled to flesh out one male character as a non-chauvinistic guardian angel, an anomaly discounting potential grounds for accusations of an offensive stereotyping of men. The story would've been sufficiently effective were it to purely follow the two protagonists on their own subjective excursion. We understand why they would view men this way. Did Schrader feel compelled to supplement an altruistic black character to Taxi Driver to offset Travis' racism?Nevertheless, Keitel's scenes are very strong. Early on, he has an unusually strong scene where he questions a waitress at the club where the two women commit their first crime. Whether or not his character's established for said reasons, his characterization's not that shallow. Keitel gives it as many dimensions as he has the allotment to. The interaction of the cast is predominantly very engaging. Ridley seems not only to see his landscape, his visual style, but the essential nature of his leads, and the difference between moments which connect with that essence and don't, and whether or not Davis and Sarandon are always authentic or not---again I think that has more to do with the sometimes mawkish writing---they connect to their deepest resources, trust the moment, even when it may feel hackneyed. Their dynamic between each other, both on-screen and subtextually, is always handled sincerely and sensitively.And yet, I think we're only offered maybe three or four complex and layered characters in all, who undergo change throughout the plot, while the rest are eyeroll-inducing stereotypes of some degree of dirty, chauvinistic, beer-bellied men and other stock characters who unconsciously act antagonistically upon the two main characters virtually like an exploitation film. The essential flaw of Thelma & Louise is that it attempts to straddle the line between the two renegades' subjective immersion in their liberation and the realities of the outside world. With realistic characters who intermingle with total clichés, it becomes alternately a social issue drama that periodically doubles back on itself, and a fascinating road movie about self-actualization.Regardless, it undoubtedly touched audiences very deeply and has earned its status as a contemporary classic for that reason. The elements of Thelma & Louise that are effective are extremely effective, to the point that its minor shortcomings can be swiftly excused in the bigger scheme of it. I'm still uncertain of the last shot. It's a freeze frame that fades to white, which is fine, except it does so with ungainly hurriedness. I can't help but agree with Ebert that it's disconcerting to become engaged in a movie that takes 128 minutes to bring you to a conclusion that its makers seem to be anxious about. But fading to white doesn't stop it from having happened as the conclusion, and it's a beautiful example, in terms of our two main characters, of high romance and how to end a story. What matters is not the tying up of loose ends, but the ultimate reaction to the whole sequence of events.",Thelma & Louise
37,Vartiainen,Ridley Scott Goes Tarantino,8,25 November 2015,"I was surprised to find out that this is not based on real life events. People tend to talk about this film and these two women in a way that makes them seem real. They get mentioned a lot along with Bonnie and Clyde or the Wild Bunch. As if they were real, which is a huge vote for the film's advantage. Though I'm not exactly surprised that many people might be operating under the same assumption as I was. Because the whole film has a feel of real life to it. The way the events play out, the natural progression of conclusions and happenings, seems so logically random that it could very well have happened.As for the film as cinema, it's very good. The best way to describe the style would be to say that it's Ridley Scott emulating Quentin Tarantino. Though, perhaps that's simply because the film has Michael Madsen and Harvey Keitel. That always helps. Nevertheless, it has a really good grasp on the classic Americana style, with great love for open roads, gas stations, bars, stetsons and sheriffs.But, what really makes the film work are the two leading actresses. Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon are both fantastic as Thelma and Louise, respectively. Both are given very good, fetching characters, but what I really like is how they evolve during the course of the film. Initially Thelma is the meeker one, while Louise has a more aggressive attitude towards life in general. But, both have their high and low points, and when they are low, the other is able to pick up the slack and keep them going, both in their own way. Two beautiful characters and the perfect duo.Thelma & Louise is a great film to check out if you like Americana, crime duos, excellent drama with a good sense of humour, chases, strong female characters or just fine cinema in general.",Thelma & Louise
38,weezeralfalfa,Girls night out gone bad - mostly excellent entertainment,9,13 April 2008,"If you can imagine a blend of ""9 to 5"", ""Smokey and the Bandit"" and ""Bonnie and Clyde"", you should come up with an approximation of ""Thelma and Louise"": a mix of adventure, humor and comrade in the style of the Bert Reynold's chase movies, and getting even with the stereotypical men who try to abuse, control or recapture these two women intent to enjoy a short escape from their boring lives. The possession of a pistol or two and some daredevil driving enables them to silence or elude most of the men who want to abuse or capture them or simply have fun with them. Clearly, Louise and Thelma initially have very different attitudes toward the strange men who try to seduce them. Loiuse makes it loud and clear she wants no part of these amorous come ons, whereas Thelma, especially after a few drinks, is often flirtatious and sometimes willing. But, Thelma eventually learns that fooling around with strange men can have traumatic consequences, and joins Louise in rebuffing further come ons. According to the DVD commentary, many in audiences cheered or clapped when Thelma's would be rapist is shot dead by Louise after making threatening remarks in the aftermath of Louise's breakup of the rape attempt. This clearly confirms what we may conclude from the popularity of confrontational westerns and action movies; that lethal vigilante justice, when done in appropriate circumstances, is considered justified by the majority of people, regardless of what the legal system thinks and does.One gets the impression that even if this duo didn't face probable long prison terms, they might have become permanent runaways from their unsatisfying lives. It is significant that neither had children, which may have alleviated some of their dissatisfaction, and which made their overblown girls night out adventure gone bad practical. The fact that both women were often foul mouthed, smoked and occasionally went to seedy bars turns off some viewers, who label them as brainless white trash who perhaps deserved some of the misadventures they suffered in their attempt at a short escape from their boring lives.Brad Pitt and Michael Madison provide two handsome hunks for female viewers to drool over, though very different. Brad represents the perfect con man who exploits naive vulnerable women both sexually and financially. He is the perfect bad boy for Thelma to find release in. Michael represents a man who isn't willing to settle down to a permanent one on one relationship, but who is willing to make occasional sacrifices for the women he has relationships with.The ending seems appropriate for this duo. Like Bonnie and Clyde, the pair eventually knew that they were doomed to long prison sentences and perhaps lethal injection, or to die in a shootout, car accident or by their own device. Like Bonnie and Clyde, they were prepared to try to elude their pursuers for as long as possible, and then to engineer their deaths if capture seemed imminently certain.",Thelma & Louise
39,strong-122-478885,"An ""Easy Rider"" Flick For Chicks!",6,19 June 2014,"For starters - There were 2 things (yes, only 2) that I didn't like about Thelma & Louise.(1) Its finale (which sucked).And, yes - (2) Brad Pitt (who sucked, as well).But, with that all said, I must honestly admit that whenever it comes to the portrayal of a truly deceitful piece of slime (like J.D.), Brad Pitt is, by far, a true champion of champions.Anyways - Since I'm already convinced that everyone out there surely knows (all too well) the basic story of Thelma & Louise, there really doesn't seem to be a whole lot of sense for me to bother to repeat it again (for, like, about the umpteenth frickin' time, I'm sure).But, in a nutshell.... When it came to suspense and comedy, I found that these 2 elements mixed surprisingly well in this film about 2 gal-pals (living troubled, caged lives) whose 2-day getaway to a mountain retreat ends up escalating into a literal non-stop crime-spree (beginning with the committing of a murder). And, at this point Thelma and Louise were, of course, forced to hightail it for their lives as the law closed in on them, but fast.You know, I really must hand it to Director Ridley Scott on this one. He certainly hit the jackpot with this ""Slick-Chick-Buddy-Flick"", although it did become a tad predictable as the story progressed. I mean, when you really think about it, Thelma & Louise rarely ventured too far off the track of the all-too-familiar ""road-movie"" trail.But, with that all said and done - Thelma & Louise was, indeed, an exhilarating, little ""joy-ride-of-a-movie"", even though it could have, but did not (contrary to what others might think) go out in a blaze of glory.",Thelma & Louise
40,kevin_robbins,There is a lot to like about this film,10,21 September 2021,"Thelma & Louise (1991) is a movie I recently rewatched on Tubi and tells the tale of best friends looking to an enjoy a girl's trip.

Will they start a new life in Mexico or will the police hunt them down and capture them? This movie is directed by Ridley Scott (Bladerunner) and stars Susan Sarandon (Dead Man Walking), Geena Davis (Long Kiss Goodnight), Harvey Keitel (Pulp Fiction), Michael Madsen (Kill Bill) and Brad Pitt (Se7en). The cast and acting in this is awesome, as was the writing in terms of character establishment and dialogue. The circumstances were fun and hilarious at the same time. Davis really nailed her naïve and frustrating character. The attire and settings in this were perfect and I also loved the hairstyles. It's also easy to appreciate the ending as both tragic and triumphant. There is a lot to like about this film and I would score this a 10/10.",Thelma & Louise
41,dee.reid,"""Thelma & Louise"" - These Girls Just Want To Have Fun... And Raise Some Hell, Too...",9,17 September 2021,"Like the genre it ultimately upended, 1991's ""Thelma & Louise"" is an outlaw road movie that's full of twists and turns, some expected, some totally unexpected. Like most road movies, there are shots of a single vehicle on lonely stretches of highway and expansive shots of the American heartland, but right away what separates it from any film before it is its uniquely feminist slant.As a male viewer who has long embraced ""Thelma & Louise"" and also understood its underlying key themes, I am often hesitant - more like, completely unwilling - to ever call the film a pure ""feminist picture"" (or more derisively, to the film's detractor's, at least, ""feminist propaganda""), I see it more as the ultimate expression of freedom and empowerment. It could have had two male leads and still have the same message (i.e., ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid""), but instead the film is about two women, so that almost immediately gives it an edge over anything that came before it - since nothing like it had ever been done before, and nothing like it has ever really been seen since.""Thelma & Louse"" is about two Arkansas women - Louise Sawyer and Thelma Dickinson (Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis, respectively, in performances that earned both of them shared Academy Award nominations for Best Actress and have a wonderfully organic screen chemistry) - whose weekend getaway is soured by a tragic encounter at a local honky-tonk bar, and both women wind up on the lam as a result.But of course, it's much more complicated than that.First-time screenwriter Callie Khouri's Oscar-winning script shows both Thelma and Louise caught in dead-end existences and desperately yearning for some kind of escape. Louise is a waitress at a diner who's in a relationship with Jimmy Lennox (Michael Madsen), a traveling musician who's afraid to commit to something more serious. Scatterbrained Thelma is married to the controlling, dim-witted chauvinist Darryl Dickinson (a hilariously dorky Christopher McDonald), who inflates his own self-importance as the regional sales manager for a local carpet company.So, yes, ""Thelma & Louise"" has a unique female perspective, and it's not particularly kind to a lot of its male characters. But it is not simple man-bashing (as many of the film's most vocal detractors so furiously claim) and it is not steeped in anger toward the male half of the species, as the ladies are aided by two sympathetic male characters - Louise's boyfriend Jimmy, who finally comes through for her just as she seems at her most liberated, and Hal Slocumb (Harvey Keitel), the Arkansas state police detective who becomes intimately involved in the women's plight. And of course, who can forget J. D. (Brad Pitt, in his ab-baring breakthrough performance), the good-looking, smooth-talking hustler who gives Thelma the night of her life between the sheets?Despite being written from a female perspective, ""Thelma & Louise"" was directed by a man, Britisher Ridley Scott, who gave us ""Alien"" (1979), which introduced Sigourney Weaver to the world as the first bona-fide action heroine. Additionally, Scott's films afterward, from ""Blade Runner"" (1982) all the way up to ""Thelma & Louse"" and beyond, have always had strong female characters that are central to the film's proceedings. Scott, a visual artist with a lush visual sense, also brings his unique English eye to the American West, so that the expansive vistas that we shallow Yanks often take for granted are given an entirely new visual appeal courtesy of both Scott and cinematographer Adrian Biddle.And lastly, there's that ending. I was actually unaware of the controversy over this film's climatic final shot until just recently. I've personally never seen anything wrong with it and have always believed it to be the most appropriate conclusion that this film could ever possibly have. Remember what I said about ""Thelma & Louise's"" underlying themes of liberation and escape? Yeah, that final shot just about sums it up. It was a brave final freeze-frame moment that shows that these two women, who we come to love and care about so much, and share such an incredible adventure (rife with danger, romance, tension, and hilarious mishaps) with have indeed made their ""final escape"" and are at last ""free.""""Thelma & Louise"" has earned its place as a cinematic landmark, despite any glaring imperfections that it might share. All the praise it has earned at the time of its release and even long afterward, is surely and richly deserved. It's thrilling, action-packed, hilarious, and is just an overall good time at the movies.Still, in the end, though - These Girls Just Want To Have Fun, And Raise Some Hell, Too.9/10.",Thelma & Louise
42,mjneu59,"just another shallow, dumbed-down buddy-film",4,7 January 2011,"All the supposed controversy (i.e. hype) surrounding the release of Ridley Scott's high-octane road film never took into account how shallow and predictable it is. Calling the movie a male-bashing chick flick doesn't hide the fact that it is, transparently, just that: an otherwise routine, gender-bent buddy film, with all the expected clichés intact. Yes, the men are all two-dimensional stereotypes (good cop, bad cowboy, confused boyfriend, insensitive husband), but the two title characters are equally insubstantial, and the inevitable (and again, predictable) merging of their contrary personalities is finally achieved in a convenient, unresolved freeze-frame non-climax designed to avoid the necessity of a genuine ending.Notice how any remorse over the killing that inaugurates their crime spree only lasts a scene or two: convention demands that they be girls who just want to have fun, and because all their (male) targets are cartoon jerks every act of violence is not only justified, but commendable. It might have been interesting to show them blowing away, in cold blood, an innocent bystander of the opposite sex, but that would only jeopardize the contrived sympathy built into their roles.Lively performances by Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis aren't enough to camouflage the formula, and at any rate both actresses are lost behind all the pretty scenery, photographed not unlike an ad for Levi jeans: only another example of how artificial the film is.",Thelma & Louise
43,Lechuguilla,Badlands,9,14 July 2008,"To escape the unrelenting dullness of their everyday lives, two middle aged Southern women head out on a vacation together. Thelma is a ditsy, innocent homebody married to an unlikeable car salesman. Louise is smart, worldly, distrusting, and a careful planner who works as a waitress.The story starts off routinely as their road trip begins, but takes a non-routine turn when an incident occurs at a restaurant. From then on, the story gradually evolves into a majestic odyssey built on a foreboding sense of desperation, as the two women drive ever westward, through the rugged badlands of the American Southwest. Indeed, this film reminds me a lot of the 1973 classic ""Badlands""; except that, as seekers of freedom, Thelma and Louise are far more sympathetic than the two lead characters in the earlier film.Both Geena Davis as Thelma, and Susan Sarandon as Louise, give terrific performances. They imbue their characters with complex traits that present Thelma and Louise as vibrant and believable, flawed but very human. In support roles, Harvey Keitel as the main detective and Brad Pitt as a drifter named J.D. enhance the film's overall quality of acting.Dialogue lends credible support to the story's characterizations, like when Thelma asks J.D. about his previous petty robbery experience. J.D. purrs in an oh-so-non-threatening way: ""Well now, I've always believed that if done properly, armed robbery doesn't have to be a totally unpleasant experience"". And Thelma's nature is such that her encounter with J.D. foreshadows the film's ending, which is both emotional and noble.Filled with mostly country/western music, the film exudes a mournful tone. I particularly like the songs ""Part Of You, Part Of Me"" by Glenn Frey, and ""The Ballad Of Lucy Jordan"" by Marianne Faithful.If the film has a weakness it is a plot that keeps reverting back to the police investigation, and therefore to the men in the two ladies' lives. I could thus have wished for less time on long-distance phone conversations and police questioning, and more time with the two central characters and their on-the-road adventure.""Thelma & Louise"" is a very American-type film, filled with dirt roads, open highway, expansive landscapes, and two likable women in search of freedom and self discovery. Technically well made, the film has both entertainment value and thematic depth.",Thelma & Louise

50,Enchorde,Double road movie,7,12 September 2006,"Recap: Two friends decide to leave their tied up lives for just an weekend and go fishing. Bur one quick stop at a nightclub along the way turns out to be fateful. Thelma, a housewife with an asshole husband, loses up a little and starts flirting and dancing with Harlan. Harlan has a plan though, gets Thelma into the parking lot and tries to get her to have sex with him. When she is unwilling, he tries to rape her. Louise finds them, and with the aid of a gun manages Harlan to stop. But Harlan makes one offensive remark to many, and Louise shoots him. The upset friends runs away and suddenly the fishing trip has turned into a run from the law. But at the same times, as the net closes in around them, they feel more free than ever.Comments: One way to put it, this is a road movie running down two parallel roads at he same time. Both a simple movie with fugitives running from the law, but also a much more deep and complex movie about two women, trapped in their ordinary lives, that finally, at last take charge of their own lives. Unfortunately, they had to break the law to do it, and someone died in the process. Two strong leading ladies, Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon, that really carries this movie in a superb way. Especially Davis manages to show the transformation of Thelma from a tied up housewife through several stages were she basically get cheated and tricked by all men in her life, a woman taken advantage of, to a woman that is strong, free and takes control of her life. And a criminal. Louise's trip or transformation is less pronounced, though she reaches the same conclusion, going back is not an option.Not to forget, they are not alone in making this movie. First off, at the base is a really good script, a script that Ridley Scott handles really well. Some shots are really beautiful, and I like the circle he draws by opening and (almost) ending with the same scene. At least according to the trivia he really made some great decisions and used some good tricks to rally make this movie as good as it is. And Brad Pitt have a small but rememberable part.7/10",Thelma & Louise
51,Steffi_P,"""At least now I'm having some fun""",9,11 December 2011,"Back in the 30s and 40s, there was a kind of movie known as the women's picture. These were typically romantic dramas told from a female perspective, and while they often featured headstrong intelligent women (at least by the standards of typical portrayals), they would often have some kind of moral at the end about being a loyal and obedient wife as a kind of final goal in a woman's life. It was a long time, even years after the era of women's lib that patriarchy in the movies began to be completely deconstructed. The subject of women driven to murder by the actions of men was not a new one when Thelma & Louise was made in 1991. But if you look at a picture like Play Misty for Me from two decades earlier, where a used woman becomes the antagonist in a Psycho-type thriller, or I Spit on your Grave (1978) in which a woman's revenge for being raped could only be shown in a lurid exploitation movie, we can see how far the perspective has had to shift.Thelma & Louise, brilliantly scripted by Callie Kouri, gives an explanation for violence by women towards men, and it does so with amazing simplicity. There are no explicit arguments made. No character makes an overt feminist statement – the closest it comes to that is a by-the-way reminder by Geena Davis to the abducted policeman to be nice to his wife. The message, as it were, is up there in the screen as the story takes place. And although the basic outline of Thelma & Louise is very much out-of-the-ordinary for most women, if you break it down moment by moment, the men they encounter and the exchanges they have are very much on the near side of normal.A lot of Thelma & Louise's power is in its magnificent cast. Both Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis have a remarkable realism that demonstrates a great rapport between the two characters. When they laugh together, it's the laughter of two friends. Sarandon is brilliant at keeping that mystery to her character – the secret in Louise's past is bubbling under the surface of her performance long before it is revealed to the audience. Davis does an excellent job of showing character development, growing from the sheltered housewife into an independent woman comfortable with her newfound criminality. And it's neat how her sense of playfulness remains somehow consistent even as she changes. There are plenty of decent supporting performances as well. Brad Pitt was obviously chosen primarily for his youthful good looks, but he can act with it. Michael Madsen is very good too, intimidating in his controlled anger, but radiating a presence that makes his attractiveness to Louise understandable.The movie is directed by that meticulous craftsman Ridley Scott. He manages the movement in the frame with expert control for the right effect. In the opening scenes, the camera follows Sarandon around the chaos of the café. As she moves into a backroom during her phone call to Davis, the movement in the background tails off but is kept going by the chef juggling a can, and then as she moves across further the backdrop becomes the tranquil fish tank. These natural-looking set-ups are carefully controlling the mood of the image. As this road movie progresses, the backgrounds become increasingly wide open and breathtakingly beautiful, in line with the spirits of its protagonists. Scott culminates all this with some wonderful stylisation in the final action sequence. The movie would be in danger of becoming overly technical if it wasn't for his almost constant focus on Davis and Sarandon's faces, such as their quiet smiles as they cross Monument Valley by night.For all its feminist modernity, as a type of movie, Thelma & Louise treads familiar ground. The story of sympathetic criminals running free across the country as fate closes in can be seen in such classics as High Sierra (1941), Bonnie and Clyde (1967) and Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969). Really, the only major difference here is that the criminals are both women, not a couple of male hoods or a gangster and his moll. And yet, all it takes is this simple gender substitution to speak volumes about the experience of women in this society. That it does so without resorting to sermonising, and keeping up a healthy feeling of fun, makes Thelma & Louise an outstanding motion picture.",Thelma & Louise

At a truckstop, a man tries to rape Thelma and Louise shoots him. Fugitives from justice, the girls head for Mexico, trying to figure out what to do and how to put things in perspective.This is a stylish, highly original, confrontational picture, with a great script by Callie Khouri, who won an Oscar. What I like most about it are the questions it asks - when Louise shoots the slimeball it's not in self-defence, but neither is it a premeditated act; he simply offends her so much that she decides to do it. This prompts both the characters and us to reflect on who they really are and what they really want to be (typified by the line, ""We got what we settled for."") and taps into a rich vein of female emancipation. It works both as a fantasy outlaw story and as a thought-provoking drama. Louise is smart but uptight and Thelma is naive but kind-hearted, but they both seem very real, and Scott and his director of photography Adrian Biddle (both of whom are British) capture the endless American landscapes with abstract precision. Sarandon and Davis are both sensational, somehow intense and goofy simultaneously, and Keitel and Madsen are brilliantly cast against type as the sympathetic males (although for me Keitel's character is just a tad too compassionate for a detective). There are nice bits too by McDonald as Thelma's irredeemable husband Darryl, and a young Pitt as a cocksure cowboy. Scott was an interesting choice to make this movie, a world away from Blade Runner or Black Rain, but it was both a commercial and a critical hit for him, although it's the two stars' movie all the way. Sarandon in particular is riveting in this film, really living and breathing the character, and giving arguably her best performance in a long career of distinguished work. Shot in fabulous desert locations in Utah and Colorado, and featuring a fine albeit underused score by Hans Zimmer.",Thelma & Louise
53,valleyjohn,That ending...,8,30 December 2020,"Why it's taken me nearly thirty years to get around to watching Thelma & Louise is a strange one considering how much I love Ridley Scott as a director.
I think one of the reasons is , that I know how the film ends . It's almost impossible to avoid knowing and that kind of spoilt it for me . Another is that it's always been labelled as a woman empowerment film and that not something that particularly appeals to me .Having now seen it , I can see why it's highly thought of . The empowerment thing is what makes the film as good as it . The men on show are generally horrible and deserve what they get and that makes the viewer enjoy their pain .Gina Davis and and Susan Sarandon are great . I actually think Davis puts in the better performance , probably the best of her career .Now to the ending . There is no doubt what happens at the end makes it a absolute cult classic but I'm not sure the two women were that mad to go and kill themselves . It's just seen out of character but who am I to question the decision of a genius like Ridley Scott ?",Thelma & Louise

There is absolutely nothing to criticize in this movie, just about every scene is flawless. This movie, besides having created two of the most amazing joyful women in film history Gina Davis and Susan Sarandon(as well as a few others notably a slick, slow talking drifter named JD played by Brad Pitt in his breakout role) takes us on an a journey of joy, adventure, tragedy, adversity, triumph and friendship.They say a good movie leaves it's mark on your life, once in awhile a movie actually alters your life's course. Thelma and Louise was actually the inspiration for myself and a friend to travel across the country and road trip the wild west. We were inspired by the movie and it's stunning road scenery and the vigorous feeling of being totally, euphorically and completely free(fortunately we didn't break any laws along the way!).This movie played a major role in my life, as well as being such an important and moving picture. To me it rates a 20 out of 10.SPOILERS:The ending, as tragic as it was, was the only way it COULD have ended. Although the sentimental part of me would love to see a part 2, the realistic part of me knows this one's better left alone as is. (Although,with Hollywood-who knows what could happen?)

59,PredragReviews,Sisters before misters!,8,29 May 2016,"""Thelma and Louise"" is all and none of the things as which it has been described. It is about the friendship between two women, about female independence and male sexism, but it is neither a simple ""chick flick"" nor a monument to feminism (although I have to admit that watching it can have an almost therapeutic effect when you've just about ""had it"" again with the male slightly-less-than-half of society). Most of the men that Thelma and Louise encounter are two-dimensional cartoon characters, but ""Reservoir Dogs"" and perpetual tough guys Harvey Keitel and Michael Madsen (of all people) are cast against stereotype. The movie also features some absolutely stunning pictures of the Southwestern scenery and mostly takes place on the road, but it is not just a ""road movie"" (feminist or otherwise). More than anything, this is a movie about the things that shape the way we are, and about the consequences of our actions. Had Thelma learned to use her brain before and not after their encounter with Harlan the rapist, she would have seen him for what he was and avoided him from the start. Had Louise not been raped herself, she would probably not have shot Harlan at being provoked by him, after the self-defense situation was already over. Impulse? Fate? Justifiable homicide? Hardly. Thoroughly understandable? Absolutely, at least from a woman's point of view.But above all else, it's a movie about two humans getting caught up in a maddening spiral of events that have taken on a life of their own - a perfect parable for what's happening all over the world, day in and day out. You set something in motion and from that moment on it's beyond your control. Thelma and Louise's only ""triumph"" is their acknowledgment that they have done this to themselves. They don't say so of course; but their final action says it for them. The plot could've also been one dimensional and uninteresting, but writer Callie Khouri again made of sparkle with inventive sequences, a solid mix of action, laughter and drama, and crackling dialogue. And the direction by cinematic director Ridley Scott is audacious. The last sequence is one of the most beautiful images in cinema, and it brought a bit of a tear to my eye. Whilst there are some laughs along the way to endure (such as the pair blowing up a foul-mouthed van drivers vehicle up), Thelma And Louise stands as a compelling and riveting drama.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",Thelma & Louise
60,Sergeant_Tibbs,"Often thrilling, but the melodrama holds it back. Sarandon shines.",7,10 July 2013,"It feels like Thelma & Louise's reputation precedes the film itself. It's another iconic film from the 1990s that I knew more from parodies and references. When I finally looked it up several years ago while I was getting into film, it surprised me that it was directed by Ridley Scott and starred Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon. While their identities are clearly on the film, the characters and themes seem to have transcended the stars' reputations. Scott's trademarks are definitely imprinted firmly here with his kinetic style of editing, great soundtrack and the humid cinematography where you can feel the heat from the screen. It's surprisingly cinematic. Unfortunately with two protagonists the story does go back and forth more than I'd like it to and it has a heavy melodrama that's involving but often too melancholic and this mood holds the film back quite a lot. The story does have its hits though and the best scenes involve Thelma and Louise's transformation such as when they apologetically put a cop in his trunk while they drive away. While Davis and Sarandon do share the film, Sarandon is the real highlight and gives a brilliant performance that feels truly genuine.7/10",Thelma & Louise

Male characters don't raise the bar either. Maybe Jimmy, but he's just passing by. The actresses are good, though. Acting was on point. The rest, except for Brad Pitt, whom I officially find overrated, is as well. The soundtrack was probably the best thing about the movie. Very good song selection. But it don't make up for the rest unfortunately, and that ending so talked about over the years, you can't really feel the danger. As far as it being a feminist movie, I hope not. Like I said, these aren't great role models...",Thelma & Louise
62,DeeNine-2,More than an exercise in male-bashing,8,8 June 2002,"This is an important commercial film aimed at blue collar women who feel victimized by both society and the men in their lives. Directed by Ridley Scott, who directed the science fiction classics, Alien (1979) and Blade Runner (1982), Thelma and Louise is an on-the-lam chick flick (with chase scenes), a kind of femme Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969), somewhat akin to Wild at Heart (1990) and Natural Born Killers (1994) but without the gratuitous violence of those films. Ridley Scott walks the razor edge between femme-exploitation and serious social commentary. Incidentally, the script is by Callie Khouri who wrote Something to Talk About (1995) and Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood (2002) which should give you an idea of how men are depicted here.Susan Sarandon is Louise, a thirty-something Arkansas waitress with an attitude and some emotional baggage, and Geena Davis is Thelma, a cloistered ingenue housewife with a yearning to breath free. Both do an outstanding job and carry the film from beginning to end. The characters they play are well-rounded and fully developed and sympathetic, in contrast to the men in the film who are for the most part merely clichés, or in the case of Darryl (Christopher McDonald), Thelma's boorish husband, or the troll-like truck driver, burlesques.I have never seen Geena Davis better. Her unique style is melded very well into a naive woman who never had a chance to express herself, but goes hog wild and seems a natural at it when the time comes. Sarandon is also at the top of her game and plays the crusty, worldly wise, vulnerable Louise with tenderness and understanding. Note, by the way, her pinned up in back hair-style, directly lifted from TV's Polly Holliday (""Kiss my grits!"") who appeared as a waitress in the seventies sitcoms ""Alice"" and ""Flo.""Harvey Keitel plays the almost sympathetic cop, Hal Slocumb, and Brad Pitt appears as J. D., a sweet-talking twenty-something who gives Thelma the script for robbing 7-11s as he steals more than her libido.This movie works because it is funny and sad by turns and expresses the yearning we all have to be free of the restraints of society and its institutions (symbolized in the wide-open spaces of the American Southwest) while representing the on again, off again incompatibility of the male and female heart. The male-bashing is done with a touch of humor and the targets are richly deserving of what they get. The ending is perhaps too theatrical and frankly unrealistic, but opinions may differ.Best and most telling quick scene is when Thelma phones Darryl to see if he has found out about their escapades. Weasel-like, he is trying to help the cops locate them, but he is so transparent to her that all she has to do is hear his voice. ""He knows,"" she says to Louise and hangs up.Best visual is when the black police helicopter appears suddenly, menacingly like a giant fly beneath the horizon of the Grand Canyon. Also excellent were the all those squad cars lined up like armored battalions aimed at the girls on the run.I also liked the scenes at the motel with J.D. and Louise's boyfriend. They were beautifully directed and cut, and very well conveyed by Sarandon and Davis, depicting two contrasting stages in male-female relationships.See this for Geena Davis because she was brilliant, vividly alive and never looked better.",Thelma & Louise
63,Howlin Wolf,Folk heroines...,10,24 March 2005,"How many tough female characters can you think of, in cinema history? If we're judging on 'action' and not REaction, then I could probably count mine on the fingers of one hand. Thelma and/or Louise would have to be included in and amongst them... Don't any guys be fooled into brushing it off as a 'chick flick', though, as the male characters are just as important to the story; and, in a pleasing surprise, not ALL unsympathetic scumbags - as I had half expected before I viewed... The whole thing demonstrates how women should be treated as equals. If you're a guy who doesn't think this already, it seems perfectly obvious to me that you have more problems than a film can fix, so you shouldn't be watching this in the first place...The ending isn't the only thing about this that's iconic (perhaps Brad Pitt, amongst other things, for you ladies!) and to accomplish the feat of connecting so resoundingly within only a decade and a half is extraordinary in itself. Some may wish for a more 'just' resolution, but both female characters realise that after the change, there's no going back...The movie never slows for scenes of quiet introspection about this 'bond' that they share, so I say this movie is less about friendship, and more about the extraordinary human resistance to hardship - given the obstacles that both women as individuals have to overcome. There will be those who shout: 'Girl Power'; but such dogged tenacity can be an inspiration to EITHER sex, and both Kietel and Madsen - in heartening 'sympathetic' roles - underline just what good can come from an understanding disposition...In a film like this, the dynamic between the two female leads should be a shoe-in for most eye-catching element; indeed, in most other films, it would be, as two great actresses do excellent work. Special mention to Ridley Scott, then, for managing to steal the movie himself with his broad direction. It oozes 'mass appeal', while never trivializing the sub-textual undercurrents that have been looked at time and time again. A neat trick for sure, and just maybe one example of why he tends to be forgiven when he has projects that aren't received so well... ('Legend' is one, for me... ) It's good that we have such types of lasting celluloid heroines, however few they are; and it's something that certainly makes 'Thelma & Louise' stand out; but don't let that obscure the fact that it's a cracking road movie on OTHER terms, also... !",Thelma & Louise
64,Screen_Blitz,"Ridley Scott's dark comedy is both shocking and cynical, but incredibly entertaining",9,20 August 2016,"Director Ridley Scott met his rise to stardom after his success with the science-fiction thriller 'Alien' in 1979, and his dystopian thriller masterpiece 'Blade Runner', although it didn't initially receive the proper recognition by critics or at the box office upon it's release. At the dawn of 90s, the awe-inspiring filmmaker decided to steer into another route aside from the sci-fi genre, and that is when he found the courage to tackle on some thought- provoking themes about society and feminism. His achievement is found here in this dark road-trip comedy starring Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis in their anti-heroine roles who are given a mouth full to say about society and it's uncouth treatment towards women, but perhaps not the most orthodox way for that matter. The film centers on Thelma Dickinson (played by Geena Davis), an Arkansas housewife living under the household of her manipulative husband Darryl (played by Christopher McDonald); and her best friend Louise Sawyer (played by Susan Sarandon), a waitress at a local diner who's dating kind-hearted musician Jimmy (played by Michael Madsen) who sadly doesn't have enough for her as his music career always have him on the road. Escaping from their boring and demented lives, Thelma and Louise decide to take a road trip in their 1966 Ford Thunderbird Convertible. Along the way, they stop at a local bar where Thelma meets a handsome young man who quickly turns dangerous when he tries to rape her. Catching him in the middle of act, Louise opens fire and kills the guy, leading to her and Thelma fleeing their hometown. Learning they are now wanted by the law enforcement, the women make a desperate attempt to flee to Mexico with Detective Hal Slocumb (played by Harvey Keital) hunting them down.If you are looking for a high-octane action thriller with gunfights and explosive special effects, then you are probably not at the right place. If you are looking a road-trip comedy with big laughs and charm, you're probably not at the right place either. Though there is some humor and cleverness to be encountered from it's two lead actresses, this road-trip flick has something much more provocative to say than just light-hearted entertaining set pieces. The movie centers on it's two titular character as journey across the country in search of a new life after becoming fed up of their sour lifestyle they endured from their constant maltreatment from the male crowd, and this all leads to a feministic atmosphere as these women fight for power over their lives. This also accounts to to some grim, but fascinating character studies. For instance, one scene involves Lousie imploring Thelma to find way to make it to Mexico without cruising through Texas due to her fear of being in the state after a horrifying experience left her traumatized. From there on, you begin to feel for both her and Thelma as you come to realize they have been victims of horrible crimes that left scars on them, and they won't heal. Although their cynical views on society and callous behavior don't make for the most likable characters, Ridley Scott does a pleasant job as providing them with a heart and humanity rather than savage criminals, and successfully maps a compelling character-driven plot up to it's shocking finale. Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis are both give endearing performances in their roles as does Harvey Keital as the Detective who hunts them down on their odyssey. Michael Madsen and Christopher McDonald are not bad, but not given a whole lot work with due to their limited screen time. One of the biggest surprises though, is the young and handsome Brad Pitt as the young heartthrob who acquired the attention of Thelma, and like most of his roles; he gets the job done.Thelma & Louise is a smart, outstanding work by visionary director Ridley Scott, with mesmerizing performances, an awe-inspiring direction driven by Scott's ingenuity, and an overall successful ability to tackle on thought-provoking subject matter. While the film does evoke a cynical atmosphere and shock value that probably won't be everyone's cup of tea, it's still incredibly entertaining.",Thelma & Louise

66,KUAlum26,Wish I could say I felt better about this film{{Spoilers Possible}},7,8 December 2007,"When I first caught this movie at the campus movie theater(discount admission,can't beat that!),it was somewhat fresh off the movie theaters,not yet on video(this was 1991,of course)and the controversy that swirled around this film was still pretty fresh,so I went into watching this with some trepidation. I was a nineteen year old boy who had little to no clue about females(one could probably say that much hasn't changed for me),and what I knew about this film was that it was considered by some critics to be ""mlae bashing"" and unfair to men,stereotyping them as either rapists or abusers. After seeing this the first time,while I was impressed with the sharpness of the film's dialog,acting and unique story,I still came away feeling depressed,though I couldn't really put my finger on why,expect for the fact that the ending was quite depressing. As I found it,I didn't find this film to be THAT male-bashing or anti-dude. I just found it a downer,in short.Sixteen years later,watching it again on TV,I found myself not feeling a whole lot differently,which amazes me,since usually when I see a movie again after a gap of time,I usually find something about it that I didn't before. Precious little if anything did I find new about this show,save that I found that WHY I found this depressing was much more nebulous. It wasn't one thing,it was everything,chief among them the fact that the fate of these two for whom you've probably come to like or deign some sympathy for are INEVITIBLY destined for a tragic fate.The adventure that begins as a simple Girls' vacation between best friends Thelma Dickinson(Geena Davis,post-Oscar,pre-pre-pre ""Commander in Chief"") and Louise Sawyer(Susan Sarandon,kickin'it at forty-four,hot as ever and tough)turns into a fugitive run as the ladies avoid a rape,kill a guy,get robbed,hold at least two different men at gunpoint(one of whom is a highway patrolman)on the highway and do damage to an oil tanker. All the while,they're pursued by a feckless fed(HArvey Keitel,in what seems to be role #776 of a thousand),seduced by a wayward slikster(Brad Pitt in his first major role,shirtless nearly the whole time)and fretted over by the girls' respective boyfriends(Christopher MacDonald and Michael Madsen). As they keep on running from their lives,they start to realize there's no turning back as their bond gets stronger.I think it bears some repeating: while I believe this movie is basically well-done and captivating,the harrowing and depressing chain of events really strike me as being a delightful movie ONLY if you're some sort of nihilistic feminist with a slight streak of sociopath.IN sum,this movie--sporting impressive direction by Ridley Scott and a daring script by Callie Khouri--is what I'd call a downer. Not for any specific reason or quality,but for the whole total package.",Thelma & Louise
67,seymourblack-1,"Freedom, Friendship & Feminism",9,28 March 2014,"""Thelma & Louise"" is not only a classic road movie but also one of the most entertaining journeys to ever hit the big screen. Its delicious combination of drama, action and comedy is brilliantly balanced to create a story that delivers sufficient humour, warmth and exhilaration to ensure that its commentary about sexual oppression never gets so heavy-handed that it detracts from the enjoyment of watching this special film. Oscar-winning screenwriter Callie Khouri deserves great credit for achieving this balance and also for the quality of her script which is intelligent and witty and contains numerous quotable remarks.Timid housewife Thelma Dickinson (Geena Davis) and hardworking waitress Louise Sawyer (Susan Sarandon) take off on a weekend vacation together to have some fun and escape their tedious daily lives. Their trip begins well and they're soon in high spirits. Things change dramatically, however, after they stop at a roadside bar where Thelma has a few too many drinks and enjoys flirting with a local redneck who takes her out to the parking lot where he tries to rape her. Louise follows the couple outside and successfully rescues her friend by threatening the attacker with a gun. When the man continues to be verbally abusive, the keyed-up Louise shoots and kills him and the women immediately go on the run because Louise knows for sure that the police would never believe their account of what happened.The two women decide to head for a new life in Mexico and the police and the FBI gather information from Thelma's husband Darryl (Christopher McDonald). Louise contacts her boyfriend Jimmy (Michael Madsen) and he subsequently brings her life savings to her. On their travels the women meet a handsome drifter called J.D. (Brad Pitt) and Thelma spends a night with him in her motel room where he describes the method that he regularly uses for robbing convenience stores. Next day, Thelma's initial state of euphoria suddenly changes when she realises that J.D. has disappeared with all their money and so to compensate for the loss, she robs a convenience store using the same method she'd learnt from J.D.Later, an encounter with a state trooper ends when the women hold him at gunpoint and lock him in the trunk of his squad car and on another occasion, they take revenge on a tanker driver who persistently makes obscene gestures at them, by blowing up his entire rig. Their no-hold-barred journey then continues in the same vein until it eventually reaches its spectacular and very appropriate conclusion.With one exception, the men in ""Thelma & Louise"" are an appalling collection of characters whose conduct is portrayed as being the trigger for the women's need to escape and it's ironic that the times when the two friends feel most excited and powerful is after having indulged in the types of criminal actions which are most often perpetrated by men.Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis are magnificent in their roles as the two women who've both been treated very cruelly by men and the supporting performances from Brad Pitt, Michael Madsen and Harvey Keitel (as the only decent man featured) are all excellent. Christopher McDonald provides a lot of laughs with his over-the-top mannerisms and Keitel's reactions to them are equally funny.""Thelma & Louise"" with its wide open spaces and atmospheric music is visually very strong and intelligently paced. It's a marvellous piece of entertainment and unsurprisingly has maintained its popularity consistently over the years since its initial release.",Thelma & Louise

I hadn't seen this in quite a number of years, and it was great to come back to.

Tragedy strikes early, however, and soon Thelma and Louise are on the run from the authorities with really no direction to go.The acting here is very good with Sarandon and Davis playing their roles perfectly. It is impossible to think of any other actress being these two. Sarandon perfectly captures the dark past and ambitious feeling of the waiter Louise and Geena Davis is so charming and bubbly as Thelma, the housewife controlled by her demeaning husband. The supporting men here are strong as well, especially Harvey Keitel as a detective on their trail, Michael Madsen as Louise's boyfriend, and Brad Pitt in a star-making role as a sweet-talking hitchhiker.All the elements work well together but I think director Ridley Scott deserves a lot of praise for creating this type of movie into one that is now considered a classic after all these years. Scott paces the movie just right, perfectly cutting between the two women and the people on their trail. We also get some nice sentimental moments between Louise and her boyfriend Jimmy, who do love each other but cannot be together. This is a formulaic story but the movie mostly avoids being a formulaic movie. I must say I wasn't impressed with the ending, but for the most part I really enjoyed this story and got involved with the characters.

71,mattymatt4ever,"Overlong, but entertaining and well-made",7,5 February 2002,"Though the film delivers a feminist message, it doesn't feel preachy.  So I wouldn't call this a ""chick flick.""  I don't really believe a ""chick flick"" genre exists, but for those guys who do--don't worry, you have nothing to worry about.  Plus, it's directed by Ridley Scott, so there's action elements scattered here and there.  There's a big truck explosion towards the end, since you can't have a Ridley Scott film without any explosions. It's just against Ridley's nature.  The story involves a studly but abusive man at a bar getting shot after attempting to rape Geena Davis and a greasy, perverted truck driver getting his truck blown up, but I still didn't feel the female screenwriter was heavy-handed in delivering her message about females being treated inferior to males in society, and her fantasy about females empowering themselves and overcoming the oppression that men put them through.  Because you really feel a connection to these characters--whether you're a man or woman--and you want to cheer for them every step of the way.  The cast is first-rate.  Susan Sarandon is superb as always, and so is Geena Davis--and man, is she HOTTT!!  My man Harvey Keitel is cool as the hard-nosed Arkansas detective.  Michael Madsen is also a really cool actor, and he's great as well, though he couldn't grasp a Southern accent.  I'll let that slide.  Chris McDonald delivers a delightfully farcical performance as Davis's aggressive but bumbling husband.  He delivers most of the laughs in the film.  I just felt the movie could've been trimmed about thirty minutes.  Plus, it's mainly dialogue-driven and it does tend to drag at points. Nevertheless it's funny, exciting, touching and one wild ride!  And it has a good message--not just about the roles of females in society but also about the power of friendship.  Unfortunately, I knew the ending before watching this movie today for the first time.  It has one of those landmark endings that everyone talks about--I'm just not going to mention it here because it would be considered a spoiler.  But I was still very entertained.

72,Stampsfightclub,Stunning drama with sensational acting and filming,9,20 August 2009,"On a road trip, Thelma (Davis) and Louise (Sarandon) set out on the run from the police after committing murder.In 1992 the Oscars were dominated by Jonathan Demme's masterful The Silence of the Lambs, a cold mystery thriller with the most famous flesh eater of all time, Hannibal the Cannibal, played with such coldness and sophistication by Anthony Hopkins. The film also demonstrated a marvellously intellectual leading role to Jodie Foster, who beat two of the finest actresses in Hollywood to the coveted prize, Sarandon and Davis.The pair certainly cemented themselves in Hollywood with this film. A powerful leading duo who make this film what it is and whilst the conceptual nature of this film is fascinating, the American actresses make this film so.Sarandon's sharp and opinionated Louise thrives the film forward with her independent mindset. This is finely balanced against Davis' Thelma who holds back and questions the course of action and can never seem to think for herself. The balance in personalities and the emotional setback the pair go through justifies the Oscar nominations and add something deep and meaningful to this movie.This Ridley Scott picture is certainly powerful when looking at a real life perspective. The two leads escape their hard lives for a mountain trip but are sidetracked when Thelma gets raped in a bar car park. This controversial realism shows the balance of strong and weak with lust against desire to make t quite horrific in a sense and Scott isn't afraid to back down on the dialogue as cursing and a sharp bullet in the chest show. This act sets the film in motion and from here on in, this is a fascinating changing drama.This dramatic implementation of murder resolves the in-depth motive of the mountain trip to be changed into a desperate journey to safety as the pair explores their options.This dramatic change and realistic example of drama is one of the main reasons why this picture won n Oscar for best original screenplay as the tension and drama really sink in.The pace continues to mount as the friends descend to desperation in order to survive. After a delightfully amusing Brad Pitt makes a mockery of the pair does the real tension set in and soon the pair cross the boundaries of innocence as they explore their options and descend to illegal activities, with the store robbery a highlight.What is also impressive about this picture is the cinematography. The sweeping settings are well used to add to the feeling of freedom when the pair enters the Grand Canyon and the operating factory the pair drive through to elude the cops. The filming is staggering and is a wonder right up until the infamous final shot, which is arguably shot of the film as Scott goes for all out in gasping climax.With Sarandon and Davis on top form and with the stunning settings and dramatically tense and exciting plot, this picture is a must see.",Thelma & Louise
73,gbheron,Thelma and Louise Are Aging Poorly,4,25 November 1998,"Thelma and Louise is a star vehicle for Davis and Sarandon, and and a soapbox for ""women as victims"" feminism.  In the movie all men are pigs, either stupid and selfish or brutal and violent (or both), and they mostly get their commupance at the hands of Thelma and Louise of whom there are enumerable close ups.  For an action/buddy movie the pacing is surprisingly slow, the dialogue ponderous, and the characters one-dimensional.  Thelma and Louise are aging poorly, and I gave it only a 5.",Thelma & Louise
74,KnightsofNi11,Good fun,7,27 November 2010,"From Ridley Scott, the man who created dark and brooding sci fi masterpieces like Alien and Blade Runner comes a story about two southern housewives on the run from the law in the wide open midwest. Wait what? The name Ridley Scott is synonymous with darkly innovative science fiction so it's always weird to see his name attached the most unlikely of projects such as Thelma & Louise. I'm not complaining though because Ridley Scott or not, this movie is actually pretty good. Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon play Thelma and Louise, respectively. The movie gives us little initial backstory, but we know enough to get into the story. We can figure that they are two long time friends who have probably lived in the same little old town for their entire lives. What we know for sure is that they have had enough and now figure it is time to hit the road and seek some real adventure. So they do just that and the main plot excitingly kicks off. Everything is going great until they stop at a bar and one of the patrons starts to get a little too friendly with Thelma. Before anything terrible can happen, Louise saves her friend and the whole situation seems to be resolved until the rapist gives a little too much lip and Louise shoots him dead. The two panic stricken ladies flee the scene and after calming down they resolve to flee to Mexico. But of course the law gets involved and they are right on their tail for the majority of the film. It's definitely a fun story with its fill of excitement and adventure.The two leading ladies are characterized very well as the anti-heroes, and Sarandon and Davis pull off these roles excellently. They're a joy to watch and their chemistry is riveting. Their progression through the movie is also very interesting to watch as they flip flop roles throughout the film. At times Thelma will be the strong and controlled type, but at other times Louise will have to take over this role while Thelma gets her head on straight. The mishaps these two have on their way to Mexico present increasingly more complex dilemmas to work out of, and the excellent performances of Sarandon and Davis keep it entertaining most of the way through. The rest of the cast, for what it's worth, are good too but the main focus is on Thelma and Louise. This film seems very anti-male, however. Pretty much every male character in this movie is either a scoundrel, a liar, or a cheater. I guess that's fitting for a movie that focuses on two strong willed and self sufficient women, but I had to scratch my head and think, jeez... we're not all this bad are we? But at least you can clearly see the film's intentions.Thelma & Louise won an Oscar for best original screenplay and I can't argue too much with that. It's a well deserved Oscar because the dialouge in this is definitely something worth noting. It captures the mindsets and attitudes of the midwest population very well. The script has a lot of life to it and even if Thelma and Louise were the only two characters in the film it would still be entertaining for a while to watch them interact. As for the story itself, most of what happens keeps it interesting, but it seems to drag towards the middle and becomes somewhat tedious. But it is all worth it when you reach the end where you realize what might have seemed tedious before was actually just build up for a riveting ending that sent chills through my body. The ending is absolutely fantastic and is no shorter or longer than it needed to be.Thelma & Louise is a worthwhile watch. It's a fun adventure story with two great main characters who you will fall in love with and be rooting for the entire movie. The portrayal of men is a little discerning, but it's also fitting to some of the central focus of the film. The film may seem redundant towards the middle but it's all worth it in the end, making this movie an all around good ride.",Thelma & Louise

The story is about two bored small-town women (Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis) who go on the run after a fun weekend together goes horribly wrong, and one of them shoots a man who was trying to rape her.Thelma & Louise is an exhilarating, adrenalin-fuelled road film with Sarandon and Davis making the most of the exuberant characters gifted to them by writer Callie Khouri; it's a welcome aberration in director Ridley Scott's career, but he doesn't put a foot wrong, and the film's elevation to classic feminist tract seems utterly merited.

I really love Thelma & Louise/Susan Sarandon & Geena Davis.,Thelma & Louise
77,Angry_Arguer,Rainy Day,8,11 August 2003,"Thelma and Louise is interesting in both its blatant shallowness and in the subtexts inadvertently created by such an attitude.  Ridley Scott finally has a decent script and a strong enough cast to make a movie that rings its own bell.Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon are an interesting pair, with Sarandon constantly having to mother Davis until she gets on her feet and starts thinking for herself.  Their interactivity is one of the best ever done in a major film like this.Scott has always tried being a visual worker, here his camera is as strong as in Alien or Black Rain, but not as good as Blade Runner.  The editing is also strong enough to keep the movie going in all of two hours.Feminism in a film like this is a touchy subject.  While on the surface the idea is proposed of feminine strength (much like Tootsie), but underneath is a social commentary on socially unacceptable men.  J.D. and Thelma's husband represent both the obvious and not-so-obvious sides of the matter.Overall, better than average film with enough strength to punch through whatever weakness the script--Brad Pitt in particular--can throw at it.  3.5 out of 5 stars.",Thelma & Louise
78,Ruskington,Much more than just a 'chick flick',7,31 August 2020,"There is a lot about Thelma & Louise that I don't like. The pacing is slow, the score is tacky and melodramatic, the ending doesn't sit well with me and there is clearly a 'men are bad' narrative throughout the film, whether intentional or not.These aspects hold the film back for me but I can also appreciate the extremely high quality lead performances that are what really carry this movie. Susan Sarandon generally gets the most credit but, for me at least, Geena Davis is the real star of this film. She does a brilliant job as the lovable yet annoyingly naive Thelma, bringing some much needed warmth to an often brutal story.",Thelma & Louise
79,gelman@attglobal.net,"Absent the Attitude, Still a Good Movie: SPOILER?",8,25 September 2011,"Thelma & Louise was a sensation when it came out, partly because it was a female buddy movie with a distinctly feminist attitude. Twenty years later, the feminist underpinning is less appealing. Murder, robbery, overpowering a police officer, exploding a gas truck because the driver is a male chauvinist pig seem distinctly less admirable than they might have been in 1991. But Geena Davis as Thelma and Susan Sarandon as Louise are excellent actors and inhabit their roles: Geena as a naive, sexy and more-than-slightly ditsy housewife dominated by an overbearing husband and Louise as a street-wise waitress anxious for more than life has given her. The presence of Brad Pitt as a handsome, hitchhiking thief provides a bit of audience appeal, though any good-looking young actor could have done as well. After Louise murders a bar fly who attempts to rape a drunken Thelma outside the bar, they begin a flight from the cops that becomes increasingly urgent once Thelma robs a store at gunpoint to restore some of the money stolen from her after sex by the handsome hitchhiker. Ultimately cornered in the desert on the edge of a canyon, Thelma persuades Louise to go out in defiant style by driving off the cliff. Despite the desire of some of the film's fans for a happier outcome, it's an appropriate ending for a feminist fantasy film that remains hugely entertaining, largely on the strength of outstanding performances by the two principals and a story which, however improbable, equals a lot of male buddy movies which preceded 'Thelma and Louise"".",Thelma & Louise
80,RonellSowes,Lighthearted Trip,6,25 March 2021,"Louise(Sarandon), a jaded waitress, and her naive, housewife friend Thelma(Davis) set out on a vacation that soon turns wrong. Before they no it the two friends are on a cross country run from the police for murder. The pursuing police aspect of this film is mostly there to keep the story moving and at its core this film is a buddy movie. While they both give fine performances, I find that Susan Sarandon brings a little more to the chemistry and film overall than Geena Davis.
I might also add that of the supporting male actors a very youthful Brad Pitt stands out the most.
While this film is centered on the camaraderie between the main characters, it's also very conscious of the area around them. Ridley Scott adds an appropriate feel to this film that creates a certain essence to the barren southwest. This is more than a bit due to Hans Zimmer's score.Thelma & Louise is a pretty tight film that doesn't bite off more than it can chew and succeeds as a fun, friendship story.",Thelma & Louise
81,perfectbond,Very memorable,8,1 November 2003,"I enjoyed this film immensely. It is funny, sad, revelatory and many more complimentary adjectives! Sarandon and Davis were perfectly cast and were primarily responsible for making the film a great paean to lower-middle class feminist empowerment. I for one only support the feminist movement as far as Margret Sanger Women's Christian Temperance went. I do not support Gloria Steinem, Betty Friedan, et al. They have caused a rift between mankind and womankind that has exacerbated relatively minor differences. They are like the shipwreckers of old supplying false charts to the navigator and are therefore leading our ship of state (the nation) to perhaps final and total shipwreck. Whether they are doing this intentionally or inadvertently I cannot say with absolute certainty. That their poisonous ideologies must be discredited is indisputable, however. Whoops! I sidetracked a little there. I recommend this film strongly especially on the limited or special or whatever new edition DVD I saw it on. 8/10.",Thelma & Louise
82,Isaac5855,A Fantastic Feminist Adventure,9,12 December 2005,"Probably my favorite movie of 1991, THELMA AND LOUISE was an exciting, gripping, and deeply moving comedy/drama/adventure about girlfriends (Susan Sarandon, Geena Davis)who plan an innocent weekend away from their hum drum lives and the scummy men in their lives and due to some unforeseen circumstances, find themselves suddenly on the run from the law. This was the first female buddy movie that completely worked for me...everything clicks here, a smart story and characters you can feel for and relate to. Although most of the supporting characters are drawn as unsympathetic bad guys, it seemed necessary in order for us to sympathize with the two lead characters and the terrible trouble they are in. The leads are superb, Sarandon in particular, gives the performance of her career that should have won her the Oscar, but I think the fact that Davis was also nominated kind of canceled her out. Khalli Couri's outstanding screenplay did win an Oscar and Ridley Scott's direction is equally compelling. There is also a memorable bit by Brad Pitt, in one of his first major roles, who makes a strong impression as a shady drifter the girls pick up on their journey.

84,emm,Feminist road classic carries a full tank of gas.,8,16 March 1999,"THELMA & LOUISE has to be regarded as a pure 90s classic that brought up a considerable amount of risk in creating a first-person feminist formula into a mainstream movie, which is often missing. It pulls off fantastically true in form, with the exceptional Southern character talents of the two lady fugitives on the run, Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon, who may stand out as memorable on the silver screen. Let's not forget that silly truck driver they pass quite often, and of course, cowboy Brad Pitt as a young student. While not needed to be fully reliant on action substances like gunshooting, there is good chemistry within its grasp. Every single minute should not be wasteful, as plenty of refreshing outbursts of enjoyment outweighs the familiar old plot of evading the police. The ending is a definite eye catcher, and also the riskiest ever filmed! Beware of this rip-off called GOOD GIRLS DON'T, another poor B-movie with no redeeming quality. Satisfyingly original, and highly recommended!",Thelma & Louise
85,skepticskeptical,Liberation or Suicide?,8,9 December 2019,"Having just watched Thelma & Louise for the first time, nearly thirty years after its release, I feel compelled to jot down a few observations. First, the shooting of the rapist was not self-defense, because the two women were secure when the shooting took place. It was an act of execution, apparently for the guy´s provocation (¨Suck my c**k!¨), but more likely it was a projection of what Louise´s rapist from Texas deserved, at least in her mind. Viewed that way, it was a revenge execution for the harm that she suffered at the hands of an equally despicable man.Second, despite the many interpretations according to which this is a feminist classic, I must demur. The problem is that the women do not prevail by changing the world but by leaving it. The world at the end of the film contains two fewer women than it did at the beginning. More importantly, two lively and bold women have disappeared from the face of the earth. They did not fit into the male-dominated world, and so they left it.Third, because not all depictions of all men in this film are negative (the Harvey Keitel character is a good example of a man who attempts to understand and help the women, to the best of his ability), I do not think that this is an anti-male screed, as some have complained. The Michael Madsen character, too, seems to be a basically decent guy, who appears even to love Louise.Fourth, because the women make blunder after blunder, this film may reinforce the stereotype according to which women are less intelligent than men. In other words, without being misogynistic, Thelma & Louise does nothing to counter the age-old prejudices according to which women are inferior, and important decisions should be left to the men folk.All of that said, the pace, cinematography, acting, directing, and everything else are really good. It is an action film, above all, but can be read metaphorically as well. Thelma & Louise ultimately poses the question: is it better to live large for a short time, or survive much longer by docilely accepting what those in power (primarily men) expect one to do?",Thelma & Louise

Facing dangers, challenges and emotions. Both Thelma and Louise are close friends who create an even closer relationship during their crazy adventure. Thelma is pretty shy and not independent at first. Controlled by her husband and doesn't have her own voice, later on in the film she becomes much more independent and daring. Louise on the other hand is more daring and sharp than Thelma. Organizes everything and plans for the long distance. The score by Hans Zimmer is just perfect (is he in every movie or is it just me?). The movie's theme is drama but when you look close enough you can tell it's sort of a dream. The dream of both women who want to be free from their ""chains"" and go wild, live their lives as free as possible with no regrets. This movie is among the best to portray women characters in lead roles and give movies a slight difference between gender lead roles and how both can be amazing. A classic for sure and a good one. Back then seeing women in lead roles was kind of a revolution and a common saying at Hollywood, it was great but now seeing women in lead roles everywhere is not a big surprise, good thing this film kept its classiness.",Thelma & Louise

This fun road trip turns into a Bonnie & Clyde-esque situation. Except Bonnie & Clyde was an adventure-filled whirlwind of romance, daring, and careful planning, while Thelma and Louise repeatedly make terrible and often illogical actions. They begin as very relatable women who need a change from their mundane lives, but they begin to develop into exactly the people that the police believe they are, and they relish in it almost to the point of psychosis.The whole cast performs well, but the movie failed to logically or emotionally hook me into Thelma and Louise's flippant acceptance of their new life.

92,majikstl,"Well, I liked the car...",3,12 March 2004,"Overlooking for a moment THELMA AND LOUISE's blatant sexism: all the men are liars, cheats, rapists or morons; all the women are ""Victims"" with a capital ""V"" -- even as they kill, rob and vandalize their way across the US Southwest.And setting aside that Callie Khouri's Oscar-winning screenplay is nothing but a collection of tired cliches from two separate genres: the male buddy film (""bang bang boom boom) and the whiny chick flick: ""weep weep sob sob"").The question that comes to my mind is why this is, in any way, considered to be a ""feminist"" film. These are, after all, two of the stupidest women who ever stumbled across a movie screen. The are not in control of their lives as some have suggested: they are on the run from the law, on the run from taking responsibility for their own reckless and criminal behavior. They are stupid and they are cowardly. They are not role models, or even typical ""oppressed"" women. But because they chose men as their victims -- and stand up to the men only when they have guns in their hands -- they are applauded for their boldness. Two men who only terrorized women would be dismissed as creeps.It is one of the perversions of feminism that women measure their success by the standards set by men, even when they would otherwise condescendingly criticize that behavior as being negative and/or macho. In this case, adventures that would be mocked as sexist if perpetrated by men, are embraced as being empowering when committed by women. Also, it is the added dynamics of the situations: if Thelma and Louis victimized any women, their defenders would not praise their actions because it would be a violation of the ""sisterhood."" It is only the targeting of male victims that earn this film its praise: Surely pure, unadulterated sexism -- or is that feminism? It's hard to tell the difference.Not that THELMA AND LOUISE isn't without good points. Anyone who appreciates Susan Sarandon's acting skills and/or Brad Pitt's sculpted torso will be gratified. Perhaps the only real star of the film, however, is Thelma's mint 1966 Thunderbird convertible; a gorgeous classic that deserves a fate far better than what is served up by this pathetically mediocre film. When Louise and Thelma meet their ultimate demise, one wishes they had had the common decency to get out of the car and jump off the cliff by themselves. The loss of that beautiful car is the real tragedy. As for Thelma and Louise? Good riddance.",Thelma & Louise
93,lordzedd-3,Movie says it's a crime to defense against rape.,1,9 October 2018,"Now there is a thousand different directions this movie could have gone, having the rapist arrested, out on bail going after them for revenge. Louise killing the attempted rapist, not being hunted but being the son of a mob boss who wanted revenge. It was clearly self defense and making them criminals for killing a creep in self defense is wrong on so many levels. Ridley Scott has a hit or miss record in my opinion and Feminist regard this a movie of women empowerment, but in what way is this women empowerment? They flee the law for protecting themselves and considering the climax of the film, the message of the movie that women can't defend themselves against sexual assault or be considered criminals and speaking of the climax, SPOILER WARNING: IF YOU DON'T WANT IT SPOILED THEN STOP READING: When the entire state police force starts chasing them. First of all, they killed one asshole, and robbed a couple of place. I don't remember, was the president's son or something? The Boston Marathon bomber didn't get that many police after them.

94,TheExpatriate700,A Minor Classic,8,4 September 2010,"Thelma and Louise, though not a masterpiece, is one of the best popcorn films of the early 1990s, and definitely a cultural landmark in its integration of a blockbuster road movie with feminist concerns. It combines excellent performances by Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon with the excellent cinematography that one would expect from director Ridley Scott.Perhaps the most effective aspect of the film is the performances by Davis and Sarandon. Sarandon is effective as Louise, giving the right balance of grittiness and vulnerability. However, although Sarandon is the one typically seen as the acclaimed actress, it is arguably Davis's performance that is the more memorable. She makes her character's transformation from repressed housewife to rebel actually believable. Thelma's initial dottiness translates all too well into her later recklessness. Davis's performance is multi-layered, making it open to question whether Thelma's transformation is liberation, or a type of mental collapse brought about by years of grinding boredom as a housewife.Furthermore, Scott brings his typical aplomb to the direction, with beautiful cinematography that captures the American West. He is adapt at presenting his flawed characters in a sympathetic fashion, retaining the audience's support even as they grow increasingly violent.However, the film has some definite flaws. As many people have already mentioned, the depiction of some of the male characters is definitely one dimensional, although this serves as much as comic relief as male bashing. More importantly, the film's tone is inconsistent, with at times jarring shifts from the comic to the serious. The film cannot decide until the last ten minutes or so whether it wants to be an action comedy or a feminist tract.It is worth considering, on the other hand, whether the film would have made as much of an impact without these flaws. Had it gone down the path of a straight feminist drama, it probably would have been confined to art house theaters.",Thelma & Louise

96,gsygsy,Worth waiting for,9,3 October 2006,"Don't know how I managed to miss this on its first release, but I saw the DVD the other night and it's dazzling - well-constructed, full of great dialogue and quotable one-liners. The rapport between the two excellent leads is clear to see. Keitel is terrific in the role of the only completely sympathetic male character. The ending is inevitable and sad, but at the same time oddly exhilarating. Considering the forces arrayed against them, where else can Thelma and Louise go? Something will have to change in the world: women must stand up to their oppressors, sure, but men must witness and understand the oppression for justice to be done. We're in this together.Coming to the movie for the first time some fifteen years late, I have the interesting experience of knowing what was to come in the career of Brad Pitt. He shows himself to be a confident young actor who can hold his own in his scene with Keitel. It's no surprise he went on to bigger things. I can't help thinking that he's better in supporting roles, as here as in TWELVE MONKEYS.The only cavil I have with THELMA & LOUISE is a small one: Michael Masden seems to be sleepwalking through his pivotal role, much as he did through his more decorative one in KILL BILL. He really is a lot better playing thugs with a surprising side to them (DONNIE BRASCO, RESERVOIR DOGS) than he is playing softer, more complex characters.

While I had been spoiled the final outcome, and the movie does prepare you for it, I still thought the last conversation they have before the movie is over was a bit off. Maybe it would have been better if they had looked at each other knowingly? Or would that be the easy way of solving it? I don't know.As you'd expect from a movie made 20 years ago, it does seem a bit dated - but at the same time, I can't see this movie being made today.Oh, and great performances from the cast.

98,malkane316,Quick Reviews!!,9,9 December 2004,"Since much has been said about the feminist arguments around this movie, i will not add anything except to say that this is an empowering film with strong female characters made in the time before the girl power movement went wrong. Nowadays female strength seems to be shown by their ability to take of their clothes- well done. Was this movie and others like it made for nothing? Today's actresses, singers, female celebrities have taken advantage of the women who actually had a thought in their heads, and seem to think they are strong because their clothes have a habit of slipping off, and make-up slipping on.But that's not for me to argue, as i'm only a man. The film itself is one of the best road movies ever, not because the central characters are women, but because they have such a strong relationship, made more powerful by the fact that they are escaping the patriarchy. The script is excellent, every performance is worthy of an award, and the cinematography is beautiful, working well with the soundtrack. Scott is known for his ability to capture an image, and his visual style here is very strong.The plot sees two women going on a weekend trip to get away from their mundane, housewife style everyday lives. When a man is killed after an attempted rape, they find themselves on the run, wondering whether they should give themselves up, or continue together. As the film moves on, their bond grows, and the ambiguous ending will continue to be discussed for many years.

They must avoid the FBI, and see if they can head back home, danger-free. Now, this movie is more than a chick flick, it's a freaking awesome movie. Ridley Scott's direction was mighty-fine, and used a combination of comedy, drama, and action, to make this movie more than just for girls. Both Sarandon and Davis played excellent roles as Louise and Thelma, and the two girls create really good chemistry. But the other great performances came from great acclaimed actors including Harvey Keitel and Brad Pitt. The suspense is real, the script is a masterful piece of writing, and you may think this movie is just a worthless road trip movie, when it's really a high-paced thrill ride. I had a fun time watching this movie from beginning to end, that I just feel like watching it again. With a mixture of action, drama, and comedy, ""Thelma and Louise"" is the perfect road trip movie to watch again and again. ""Thelma and Louise"", in my review, ""a high-paced thrill movie, a different type of chick flick"".",Thelma & Louise
100,jayjaycee,Feminist cinema at its best,8,25 August 2020,"""Thelma & Louise"" is a 1991 crime drama directed by Ridley Scott starring Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis.
⚪
All in all, this emancipatory road trip hits at the most unpleasant spots and runs from gender stereotypes in the most stylish manner, as it issues a powerful feminist statement and at the same time fights against toxic masculinity and declares a necessary war on the patriarchy itself. What ""Alien"" director Scott has created with this compelling drama can best be described as the ""Bonnie and Clyde"" of the early nineties, only that the two leading ladies were like ""To hell with Clyde, this is pure Bonnie"" - and I love that. It is obvious that it follows two anti-heroines, but considering what they have been through, how can you really judge them completely? Both have experienced some form of toxic masculinity in the past and just got along with it, but this film shows the moment when both are fed up to the back teeth. Thelma escapes from her totally oppressive husband and Louise gets the chance to be herself again, even if her boyfriend Jimmy isn't as malicious as the partner of her best friend. The main aspect is that they are finally able to be independent and act for themselves. As it is sadly the case, the world harbours several dangers and when Louise shoots the pig that tried to rape her best friend, they get more and more caught up in criminality. What Thelma correctly points out is that no one ever would have believed them that it was rape - an aspect that shockingly is still the same today as it hasn't changed in a bit. From there on, they are on the run and rather commit more crimes than surrender and return to their male dominated lives. In real life, those two ladies should be locked up and absolutely not glorified. In this case? It might be radical, but I think this an evocative film that shows what might happen if you mistreat women and only objectify them. The film would have ended after less then thirty minutes if women were treated equally and listened to. I mean, the film often enough points out what the behaviour of men is like (even today): One doesn't accept ""no"" for an answer, the other only married his wife because she cooks him a meal after work and another catcalls them on more than one occasion. This film gives an insight of how women feel when they are treated like this and shows that their extreme measures are only the result of disgusting behaviour on the side of men. Humane reaction? I think so. All of that wouldn't be as effective as it is without the powerful performances of the two leading ladies Sarandon and Davis who, despite their ten year age gap, have an immensely genuine chemistry and lead this unusual road trip magnificently and develop wonderfully. Aside from this, the appearances of future Tarantino superstars (Keitel, Madsen, Pitt) and the awesome cinematography by Adrian Biddle exude severe western vibes and contribute the most to the overall dramatic atmosphere of that film. And I haven't even mentioned the score by maestro Hans Zimmer. The ending of the film isn't only magnificent, but also meaningful in terms of the values it previously stood up for. After all has gotten worse and they are about to get arrested, they rather keep on and drive over the cliff instead of surrendering to the police, and I think this act is the climax and final act of defiance towards the patriarchy they fought before. They rather die than give up. Could they be any more sassy? I don't think so. In the end, this film is an outstanding display of women power and shows that females are powerful as well - even if some don't expect them to be. It hasn't lost any relevance and the problems depicted are still the problems of today. So, the next time you want to catcall some girls, think again, because it might happen that they blow up your freaking truck. In conclusion, treat women with more respect, okay? Thanks a lot.",Thelma & Louise
101,thebricks,"The scene at the bar was so dumb, I shut the movie off.",1,22 September 2018,"Geena Davis leaves a bar with a guy after feeling dizzy. Guy tries to rape her and punches her a few times. Susan Sarandon plays her friend who comes to rescue her by pointing a gun at this guy. Guy talks trash to Sarandon and Davis and she responds by shooting him.Davis and Sarandon flee the scene thinking about what they are going to do. Geena Davis's face is battered and bleeding. Come on, it's 1991, video cameras weren't really around much and not even that good to begin with. That would have been open and shut self-defense, case closed. Why run away? They're women, they're not dumb.That scene set the tone for the terrible writing in this film and I just shut the movie off. There was no point caring after that.",Thelma & Louise
102,yris2002,Exhilarating and breathtaking road-picture,9,27 September 2009,"When you see a movie different times, each time stirs different emotions, or the same ones but with different intensity. It's your present condition and mood, together with your past experiences that influence the way it gets to you: in this case, with ""Thelma & Louise"", the original strong emotion I felt when I first saw it many years ago, was strengthened by the vivid remembrance of an amazing on the road journey, I have recently made with a friend, of those infinite roads leading to nowhere, those desolate lands, those squalid motels and houses appearing as ghosts in the middle of nothing, stirring a sense of deep nostalgia, but at the same time making the movie more intense and vivid. The two protagonists,Thelma and Louise, represent the best possible existing form of friendship between two women, because not stained, as it often is in real life, by the cancer of human feelings, envy: their condition gets growingly more dangerous and desperate but their deep solidarity remains untouched by external events: they feel, think and act as if they were one body and one soul. Their story and inner struggles penetrate in the viewer's perspective as if we were there, driving with them, as if we could feel that wide range of sensations, from freedom, to fear, from joy to desperation, a whole category of human feelings concentrated in a single journey, and the emotional impact is truly intense. The scenery is, obviously, breathtaking: those infinite spaces, that for Europeans are so unconceivable, cannot leave you without a sense of the smallness of human beings towards the absolute and infiniteness of the universe, they may either amplify your inner struggles, or help you downsize them, but in either cases they cannot leave you untouched. Gena Davis and Susan Sarandon are simply superb, magnetically paired, extraordinarily over the top: I think women could learn much from them about the real significance of female friendship and solidarity. A must see movie.",Thelma & Louise
103,deepfrieddodo,Jeez Louise,9,8 December 2020,"A classic in every sense. Many may state this is a 'feminist' film, putting some people off, but that's really not the portrayal. The story follows two strong women relying on themselves and developing into a life they never thought they would live. But that's not pushing any underlying message, they're charismatic characters with deep backgrounds. It's also two women as leads, get over it. Both perform excellently and the support from Keitel is brilliant too, plus a young Brad Pitt pops up too.Engaging and swift, everything moves at a good pace, never becoming tedious or losing its bind. I imagine most above a certain age know the ending to Thelma & Louise, but that doesn't remove the impact of the climax, and if you have no idea, it's an iconic moment in cinema that must be seen.",Thelma & Louise
104,eshwarmail,Not a movie one would expect of Ridley Scott,7,22 September 2012,"Having seen most of other Ridley Scott movies, it is quite surprising he has made this. It is a perfect case study for movie students with its highly structured screenplay, hardly any innovation or experimentation (theme maybe new for its time but my point is on execution), template characters and a highly predictable but a perfect end.Thelma (Geena Davis) and Louise (Susan Sarandon) are friends but leading un-fulfilling lives. One day they go on a weekend vacation where things go horribly wrong after a dreadful incident. When they realize they have nothing meaningful to go back to, they become fugitives suspected for a murder and decide to take the road to Mexico. New acquaintances, an obsessed police detective on pursuit and some amateur mistakes make them reachable by the had of law. Watch the movie to know if they surrender meekly or take the fight back to the law though most of you know what happened to them even if you had not seen it.Never a fan of Geena Davis but she is quite a charmer in this. Susan Sarandon is always a good actor and she sleepwalks through this template character. Though there were many other movies of a similar genre like Butch Cassidy..., Bonnie and Clyde etc, it fills the periodical slot for the insatiable demand for such movies by audience. It may have worked for the time, but I felt the dialogues, screenplay, background score etc felt too generic to stay back in my mind after watching the movie, though I loved the subtle camera work.Not a movie one would expect of Ridley Scott, but being a great talent he is - made this too look quite interesting.",Thelma & Louise
105,luke-a-mcgowan,Ridley Scott directs some of the best performances of the 90s from his stellar cast,8,17 May 2015,"Thelma and Louise is one of those movies you know a lot about going in. Its been heavily parodied for its iconic scenes, most notably by the Simpsons episode ""Marge on the Lam"" and pretty much everyone knows how it ends going in. But just like other iconic 90s movies with well known endings - The Usual Suspects, The Silence of the Lambs, Titanic - its the journey to the final act that makes the film so enjoyable, and renders surprise at the ending unnecessary.This is a significantly unusual film for Ridley Scott, director of action/sci-fi blockbusters like Alien, Black Hawk Down and Gladiator. But it earned him one of his Best Director nods (a lone one, as the film didn't earn a Best Picture nod) and I am satisfied that he deserved it. If the job of a director is to get the best performances out of his cast, then he does a hell of a job (more on that later). The film is well-paced, the shots are amazing and the artistic choices are perfect. I loved the film's cinematography and editing, the beautiful shots especially in the Grand Canyon at the film's conclusion. That one shot of the Thunderbird blasting across the sand with dozens of police cars in hot pursuit is iconic for a reason, it really is a beautiful shot. Scott does a remarkable job with his juxtapositions throughout the film. The two ladies flee the scene of a crime and Louise chides Thelma for littering. The two ladies lock a state policeman in the trunk of his car, apologising politely for doing so. It makes for some very funny moments in what is essentially a crime drama, and all credit is due to both Scott and Khouri (writer of the Oscar-winning screenplay).But the director's main job is to get strong performances out of his cast, and he does wonders for Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis. We mark the differences between the two women at the start, and thanks to some wonderful chemistry and the direction that Scott takes them, they grow more and more similar. Take a look at the poster. If you are like me, you have to double check which is Sarandon and which is Davis. But at the beginning of the film, you'd never know that. They are worlds apart - Davis is a prim, pristine dresser lugging bags and bags of ziplocked clothing, whilst Louise is a chain-smoking, messy packing waitress who bundles it in and damn the consequences. Thelma's baptism by fire (the distrust of men and her run ins with the law) brings her closer to Louise, allowing her to think and act at times where Louise cannot. By the end of the film, Thelma has ditched her pristine clothes for a baggy, dusty singlet, and is sucking down cigarettes and alcohol just like Louise. Similarly, Louise's reconciliation with her loyal boyfriend Jimmy makes her realise than men aren't all as evil as she thought. The best part of this film is that with little effort at all, you don't know which of the ladies is the stronger one, nor do you know which one is running and which one is following. Halfway through, Thelma asks Louise not to run out on her, mirroring the exact question Louise had posed to Thelma at the beginning of their problems. Its a remarkable performance by Davis - sexy, gentle, fiery and cheerful - and in my opinion, she is the most impressive of the cast. Were it not for Jodie Foster's iconic performance that year in The Silence of the Lambs, Davis would have a second Oscar on her shelf. Sarandon is brilliant in this film as well, in a less showy but no less impressive role. You can see the hurt bubbling below the surface and the hatred and distrust of all men that motivates her actions. The rest of the cast is also great - Brad Pitt is easily charming and more than a little arrogant, drawing the audience into trusting him just as he seduces Thelma. Timothy Carhart is essential as Harlan - another example of Scott's direction, Carhart's aggressive body language during his dances with Thelma foreshadow what is soon to come. Twist my arm for a weakness, and I'll say Michael Madsen's Jimmy, who flopped back and forth to suit what the script needed him for. Many point to Thelma & Louise as the quintessential feminist film. I have to agree, and would far prefer people to use these two as feminist icons than Danaerys Targaryen. The film does a great job of being pro-women without being anti-men. It shows two women who are very capable of looking out for each other and themselves when all the men in their lives are lazy, stupid or mean. I feel that the character of Hal (Harvey Keitel) was a vital one, despite his non-showy role, to keep the film from being grossly biased in its depiction of men. The final shot, with Hal desperately sprinting to save them, is a beautiful moment for all - he wanted to save them, but they'd already decided to save themselves. Thelma & Louise is a film I kept on putting off watching, but I'm very glad I now have. You could write essays upon essays on the themes and transformations of this film. I finally find faith in Ridley Scott's abilities as a director, and the acting performances of Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis will go down in the history books.",Thelma & Louise
106,SafReviews,Really interesting movie,8,5 April 2019,"Good movie with an intriguing plot with some twists which makes the movie better. It's not one of those drama movies were certain parts of the plot just drag along; all of the scenes are good, well except for the sex scenes which I found unnecessary. It has some really funny and also some serious moments which is a good mix. The characters of Thelma and Louise where well portrayed which makes you root for them. To be honest, if this movie was released today it would receive more controversy as people might think it offends men, but for me as a man I wasn't offended by it much.",Thelma & Louise
107,cinephile-27690,Fun movie with a lot of heart.,10,16 September 2018,"My cousins suggested that my Grandma and me see this with them and I am glad that they did. I have the book 1,001 Movies You Must See Before You Die and this was one movie I had to check off.In many reviews I write I summarize the movies I see. I am going to skip that for this movie. You can find that elsewhere on IMDB. There is a lot of humor in this movie, and this is an example. Thelma has an abusive husband(he does not hit her but he treats her more like a slave than a wife.) Thelma, on the road with her friend, calls her husband, letting him know she intends to return in a couple days. ""No, you are coming back NOW!"" he insists. ""Darrell?"" ""Thelma?"" ""Go **** yourself."" she replies, and slams the pay phone on the stand. I laugh every time that happens, and I applauded slowly when I saw the clip for the first time. Thelma and Louise is in fact a lot of fun and it has a great message about friendship. It's very well worth seeing.",Thelma & Louise
108,fimimix,..I wish I had a friendship like this..,10,6 May 2006,"Thank heavens they saved most of the negative opinions for the end of this site. Like many of the ""users"", I can enjoy this movie whenever. Once I find a film I love, it doesn't matter whether I truly understand it or not....if the characters are well-developed, and I can see their importance to the story - and the storyline is something different than my mundane life - I am hooked to the end. Fortunately for most American viewers, they have not experienced some of the almost accidental situations in life which can turn to be unsavory and life-threatening.I was not familiar with the plot of ""Themla and Louise"", but knew it was extremely popular. A personal situation hugely influenced me to love this movie: I love to drive cross-country, even alone. I have friends who are about as different in personality as ""Thelma and Louise"" were....I have visualized the same kind of journey as the two girls take, purely for fun, without the desperation of their dash for Mexico - just get in the car and start from the Pacific Coast and drive East. What a blast it would be to act nutty and fun-loving, as these girls did, in a world that is quickly becoming true insanity.....that Themla and Louise could zoom across our country, as close as two people could be without being lovers, enthralled me. Didn't and won't ever happen - well, maybe. I'm ambivalent - my personality changes to the atmosphere I'm in. So, I thoroughly relate to ""Themla and Louise"".Every scene was filled with dedicated actors/actresses who did their job well. If you read the homepage of this site, you'll discover Susan Sarandon made suggestions about many of the scenes, Ridley Scott being the wiser for accepting her insight. By now, I suppose everyone knows the story of a world-wise waitress whose very happy relationship with her man couldn't prevent a ""fishing-trip"" with her friend, who was trapped being married to a smart-ass-cheating husband. ""Louise"" (Susan Sarandon) takes only a few personal things; ""Thelma"" (Geena Davis) takes everything but the kitchen-sink. She could have had a premonition she would never be ""home"" again, the trip providing her escape. Along the way, ""Thelma"" convinces ""Louise"" she desperately needs a couple of drinks. They party at a country-western roadhouse with line-dancing patrons. Fun start for the trip, but things get ugly in the parking-lot - won't say what - which shocks ""Louise"" into a deadly-serious incident, necessitating the dash for Mexico without driving through Texas - she won't say why. This prevents them from traveling on major highways, but provides us with the gorgeous panorama of The West. ""Thelma"" is already a nutcake; to see ""Lousie"" shaky and unsure certainly sets the scene for some exciting activity.""Thelma"" gets the hots for a hitchhiker while ""Louise"" is telephoning her man for money....he doesn't wire it, he takes it to their motel in Oklahoma City. A scene between ""Louise"" and her love-without-question man is bruising and tender. The scene between ""Thelma"" and the hitchhiker (whom ""Louise"" has allowed ""Thelma"" to persuade her to let him join them on their wild journey) is screechingly funny - and sexy - and innocently instructs ""Thelma"" with the plan to regain the money ""Louise's"" man has brought, and the hitchhiker (Brad Pitt in his young beauty) makes-off with. In a scene which shows us ""Thelma"" isn't as ditzy as we believe, the dash for Mexico resumes. The girls are smart enough to realize they are ""wanted"" criminals - their back-and-forth telephone-conversations with the cops, who eventually catch-up to them, is the basis of some wild chase-scenes that too soon puts ""Thelma and Louise"" at the end of their road.....""together"".........Pitt is a ""pretty boy"", but plays his role to the hilt. Brava to Davis and Sarandon! Harvey Keital escaped his usually ""heavy"" roles and showed a real empathy for the few intelligent cops there are. Whoever played Sarandon's lover - never heard of him - was touching in his manly, overly macho role. There is so much I can't write about without giving away the plot.All that action with the cop-cars and 'copters in the ""chase""-scenes was amazing and added the necessary desperation to the girls' situation. That they evaded it all until they came to the point where there was no escape only cemented their friendship - TOGETHER, no matter what. I repeat, I wish I had a friend like that.The ending of this epic film could not have been different, totally making a sequel impossible - it could never have been as vibrant as this movie was. Leave it alone! and revel in this ""road-show"" (?) as it speeds across our beautiful country. The movie is more than a herald to the way our women have evolved. The movie deserves another, major release with all the red carpets and hoopla - viva ""Thema and Louise"".",Thelma & Louise
109,fung0,Shameless,2,3 August 2008,"If your idea of a ""great"" movie is one that defies all standards of quality while blatantly fondling your ""hot buttons,"" this film might be your cup of tea. Everyone else will see it for the agonizing mess that it is.It is NOT the message that I object to; I believed in equality of the sexes back before it was even a topic of discussion. But IF I took this idiotic film seriously, I'd have to feel embarrassed about that position. As others have noted, if you substituted two men for the two female protagonists, angry mobs would probably have shouted this film out of theaters. This film does for feminism what Billy Jack did for pacifism.Aside from this, the film has almost no entertainment value. As others have pointed out, the heroines here are both unlikable and unbelievable. The story is negligible, and what little there is somehow manages to be both preposterous and tediously predictable. The ending is stolen from much better films (Butch Cassidy; The Wild Bunch; Vanishing Point; even Paperback Hero...), but makes no sense in this context, other than to (apparently) convince the gullible viewer that they've had a Great and Meaningful experience.That leaves only the heavy-handed ""message"" to win audiences over. Alas, if your position on sexual equality is so precarious and so poorly considered that this film makes you feel good, you probably need to re-examine your entire philosophy of life. Not to mention your rather low taste in cinematic arts.",Thelma & Louise
110,dakjets,Epic,9,2 July 2019,I guess most things have been written about this fantastic movie. I just wanted to share some thoughts after seeing it again the other night. This is one of those films that problably will stand the test of time for all time. It is not dated in any way. I think it never will be. The message of true friendship will always make this movie worth seeing for generations to come. Why don't they make them like this anymore?,Thelma & Louise
111,wnterstar,I should love this movie,8,2 April 2006,"I should love this movie, but I don't and I'm not sure why. I applaud the feminist statement it makes, but it just misses for me.That's not to say that it doesn't have some great moments and fabulous acting. The cinematography is awesome, and the soundtrack is perfect. It keeps you guessing.It has an extraordinary way of making you root for these woman, forgetting that they killed a man (OK, that one was justified, the guy was a jerk), robbed a convenience store, and blew up a guys truck (and, yes, that guy kinda deserved it too!). But the bottom line is that if they had turned themselves in at the beginning, after shooting the man who was raping Thelma, then the rest of the movie wouldn't have happened. It was self defense, and they wouldn't have done much jail time, if any (OK...they would have done time, it was set in Texas!) It's always a pet peeve of mine in movies where, if the person just used common sense in the beginning, then the rest of the movie wouldn't have happened.The other thing that prevents it from being a 10 for me is the end. SPOILER ALERT!!! DON'T READ FARTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT TO KNOW THE ENDING!!!!! I wanted them to get away to Mexico, not go off the side of the canyon to certain death. By that time, I KNEW they wouldn't give up to the authorities, and really didn't want them too. I would have preferred them just barely escaping into Mexico and disappearing, only to find them lounging on the beach with drinks in their hands.*sigh* I do understand why that couldn't be the ending, but the hopeless romantic in me wanted a happy ending.Definitely worth seeing, maybe even seeing several times!",Thelma & Louise
112,Sober-Friend,You will not forget this film,9,22 March 2018,"This is one of the rare times that I went to see this movie more than once. When I first saw it ""I had no idea what to expect"" and neither did the audience. Everybody thought we were ""Seeing a Comedy"". So the events in this film shook me (and the rest of the audience) to my core. What I saw was a film that did not follow the predictableness of a Hollywood film. What I got was an eye opener. I loved the film regardless of the events that happen in the film.I do not want to give this entire film plot away but to me ""Everyone Should See This Film"". It is a statement on relationships and how things happen when you ""Never Saw It Coming"" WOW!!",Thelma & Louise
113,freaky_dave,Almost perfect road movie about two women on the run,9,2 May 2006,"Thelma and Louise is a rarity. It is a buddy movie about two women, and it is one of the best road movies to ever grace the screen.Louise (Susan Sarandon) and Thelma (Gina Davis) are two friends who plan a road trip into the mountains for the weekend. Neither one of their lives seems exciting at the moment. Louise waits tables at the local diner and is also waiting on boyfriend Jimmy (Michael Madsen)who is always traveling and seems destined to never settle down. Thelma is a sexually repressed housewife who lives at home with a self-important husband (Christopher McDonald) who doesn't seem to care much for her at all except when she is not fulfilling her house-wife duties like having diner made and the house cleaned.It is no wonder these two decide to take a trip for the weekend to the mountains to get away for awhile and have fun. Of course there is an event that happens not long after they have started their journey, and right after said event, things quickly spiral out of control as the two girls find themselves racing for Mexico with the law quickly on their heels.This movie could've been just another boring road picture, but both Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon along with a fine script and clever pacing by director Ridley Scott, make it much better. Davis and Sarandon have great chemistry together, and the script is loaded with offbeat humor to go along with its clever story. The movie is never boring because Ridley Scott makes it so by slowing the pace down at the right moments, and then picking it back up when necessary. I enjoyed all the characters, including the minor ones which included a cameo by Brad Pitt as the young hitchhiker JD who Thelma quickly falls in lust with.Some people may see this as the ultimate female picture, but I think it is more than that. Harvey Keitel is the inspector on the case who believes that these girls really aren't as bad as some may think, and his character is interesting as well because he seems to understand why everything involving the girls has lead up to this series of unfortunate events. Michael Madsen, as Louise's boyfriend Jimmy, also adds depth to his role as a man who though upset with what Louise is going to do understands and loves her still. These two characters add something more to the story which makes it less of a feminist picture without once taking away from the two leads. If that was even possible.My only gripe with the movie would be the ending. Not the way it ended but how quickly it rushed to the end credits. I for one, like Roger Ebert who stated the same thing in his review of the movie, believe that the ending should of lasted a little longer before fading out. That's my only problem, and it's the only reason why the movie doesn't get a perfect score from me.",Thelma & Louise

115,erwan_ticheler,"Pretty good movie,but an empty script",7,31 July 2004,"SPOILERS!This 1991 female power movie is all in all nothing more than a remake of both EASY RIDER and BONNIE AND CLYDE.It has the deep message of EASY RIDER and the storyline of BONNIE AND CLYDE but in both cases it isn't as good as the originals.Ridley Scott(BLADE RUNNER,ALIEN,GLADIATOR)shoots some great scenes of southern USA but forgets to put in some believable stories and that's the biggest minus of this movie. The acting isn't the problem.Both Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis play well although it gets over the top on several occasions.The supporting cast is in good hands with Michael Madsen,Christopher McDonald(whose character is really funny) and a young Brad Pitt playing The Marlboro Man in a very convincing way and showing his great acting skills. But the greatest actor of them all is Harvey Keitel,he is my favorite actor anyway and he shows why.Although he's not much present in the first hour of the movie(which is a shame)his acting in the second part of the movie is superb.Still,his character is very badly worked out.I mean why is he helping these girls? what is his history? All the men in this movie are sexists except Harvey,why is that so? Not good characterization.When you look at the movie the only really important scene is the last one when Thelma and Louise hit the pedal to the metal into the Grand Canyon.This last freezing shot of the car falling into oblivion is obviously an hommage to BUTCH CASSIDY AND THE SUNDANCE KID but it also has got the same ending of EASY RIDER and BONNIE AND CLYDE,only now the leading characters choose to die. The channel upon which the movie was on ruined the last shot because the freeze wasn't there,they had to show trailers of other movies! I hate commercial channels.Anyway,a fun movie with some sort of message although I think it would have been a better idea when Scott had been replaced by a woman. 7/10",Thelma & Louise
116,mrcaw1,Overrated film with likable leading ladies......,10,12 May 2004,"It's a shame that this movie seems to have been selected as somehow being a feminist, female empowering movie. I say this because the movie actually performs a dis-service to real honest to goodness feminist ideals and to movies who show actual female heroines.While both the female leads, Sarandon and Davis are likable and winning in their title roles, the writing ultimately causes the film to fall short of what it could have been: a female Butch Cassidy & Sundance Kid, which it is most decidedly not.The problems start very early on in the movie. When Sarandon's character winds up killing the would be rapist, it's hard to believe that our two female leads would decide that their best course of action is to get into their car and flee.There is nothing in either of their backgrounds that has been presented to believe that the characters would feel it was smarter to get in that car & run than to deal with the situation. This is the film's fatal flaw and the plot twist on which the whole movie hangs. If you don't buy the fact that the characters would get in that car in the first place, then the whole movie is going to be one long demonstration in stupid people doing stupid things and while Thelma & Louise are not presented as brain surgeons, neither are they portrayed as out and out idiots. Their fleeing is simply the (female) writer's idea of what she believe's a ""downtrodden"" woman would do. It undermines the credibility of the female leads as being able to handle their own problems & instead must run away from them.But accepting this hard to believe plot twist if we're to have a film and moving forward, we're presented with the considerable talents of Davis & Sarandon. They're chemistry is great and the scenes are generally played lightly. Davis picking up a young Brad Pitt playing a male bimbo is one of the movies finest and a genuine sexual role reversal. Ironically, it's probably the role for which Brad Pitt has been best suited. Suspending disbelief and simply enjoying the movie is certainly possible and that is the way this movie should be watched. **SPOILER AHEAD***Knowing beforehand, that the movie ends with the stars again implausibly committing double suicide by driving their car off a cliff actually helps the viewer not become totally enraged by the visually fun but incredibly stupid and unbelievable ending.",Thelma & Louise

Not only is the acting excellent, the basic premise that we are all only s small step from the road to ruin/redemption/salvation  [one interpretation of the movie] is credible and in this movie thoughtfully explored.Hats off to the girls and both Keitel and Pitt in supporting roles.7/10 well worth watching and so very nearly an 8.",Thelma & Louise
119,skullhead739,Decent road trip classic,7,11 July 2020,"This film is a great road trip movie about two female leads that have way too much fun to be legal.Acting:
The two leads and performances are great. Very well developed characters with good back stories and good supporting characters. I do however dont like how annoyingly stupid and naive Thelma was.Story:
A great problematic road trip that as many people point out does have a lot of man related troubles and seems like a feminist movie. I however just think this film points out crappy situations woman get into especially in the 90s or earlier. It's a fun ride of unexpected twists and a great friendship. The ending is very memorable and does the characters justice, to live free.Summary:
Overall I would reccomend this movie. Some things seem a bit unrealistic, annoying and slow hence the 7/10 but in general this is packed full of twists and is a Good film of the 90s.",Thelma & Louise
120,C22Man,A Tale of Friendship and Freedom,6,29 June 2016,"Thelma & Louise is a take on the road-trip movie genre with one interesting difference, both of the protagonists are women. When you consider all of the films in this style, from 'Bonnie and Clyde' to 'Rain Man', this is the first time that we have followed the journey of two ordinary, working-class women. It puts a nice twist on a type of film that is usually full of twists itself. Adding to that is Ridley Scott, known for making technical marvels, trying his hand at something much more human and sensitive. The story follows our title characters as they break the shackles of their ordinary, dull lives and hit the road for a weekend of fun. Thelma is upbeat but naïve and controlled by her overbearing husband Daryl, whereas Louise is much tougher and resourceful despite her relationship with a musician going nowhere fast. Both girls have large contrasts but they seem to fit together despite that. They're characters are well-formed and emotive, endearing because they feel like real people who are simply trying to break away from their repressive lives. Importantly their characters transform as they experience more and more. They have to rely on each other and they begin to take each other's characteristics as a result. Of course things are never that straight-forward and the women are soon on the run when they kill a would-be rapist. Pursued by the police, they decide to keep on moving forward whether that includes breaking the law or disrupting their romantic relationships. Callie Khouri's script already has two interesting leads, but the acting can't be underestimated. Both Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon inhabit these roles with all the passion and wit that you would be hoping for. They work together flawlessly which helps make their friendship seem all the more plausible. Sarandon especially stands tall given how she manages to capture the weariness and yearning of Louise whilst giving her relationship to the more innocent Thelma an almost motherly edge.Along the way the girls meet a handsome drifter played by Brad Pitt (in an enjoyable early performance) who soothes Thelma's sexual desires, but then robs them of all their money. Harvey Keitel is as solid as ever playing the detective how has sympathy for their plight. He doesn't want their situation to become increasingly worse. The issues with the film come with the male characters. Though Keitel's cop does come across as genuinely concerned his colleagues don't share his sentiment. Pitt's drifter basically lies and tricks them. Thelma's husband is overly bitter and aggressive towards her for little reason. Even Michael Madsen as Louise's boyfriend seems prone to lashing out rather than calmly resolving the issues. These male characters all seem to be edgy and hostile in some way. It's not to say they're badly played or totally unrealistic, but they all appear to against the women when there is little reason or logic for them to be.Scott is a visual master and he brings his A-Game here. For a filmmaker so used to neon colours and atmospheric murkiness, it's satisfying to see him visualise the dusty trails and open roads of Southern America. The opening credits scene is simply overlooking a long road leading to a canyon. Yet it's sheer scope and its vibrant blue sky makes it the perfect introduction. There's plenty of dusky Blues music to fit the scenery and it usually sits nicely alongside Hans Zimmer's score.Sadly I really have issues with the films ending. The idea itself is fine and it is a conclusion that we don't often see and I like how everything isn't wrapped in a neat little bow. Yet the film has hit its end point and screen just fades to white after just a few seconds. It is far too abrupt. After having spent so long with these characters, growing to care about them and seeing their journey change their lives in so many ways, it almost feels like we've been duped by such a hasty final shot. It doesn't completely derail the precision of the film, but it does help stop it from reaching the true heights it was so close to.Putting its ending and its portrayal of its male characters aside, I think Thelma & Louise is a very enjoyable film that tackles subjects that aren't usually handled well and takes itself seriously. The title characters become memorable, in part due to a well written script and some wonderful acting from both actresses. It is mostly a film about friendship and freedom, something these two very different characters have in common. They escape the numbing grind of their everyday lives for something that lets them feel free, even if they break the law doing so. It's difficult not to at least appreciate a film that tells a story like this and even though it doesn't quite soar, there's still a great deal to admire about it.",Thelma & Louise
121,Jakemcclake,I don't like it,5,19 June 2009,"Spoiler Alert I have watched many movies of the mold that Thelma and Louise was from, prior to seeing this movie. I hoped for another of ""Jessies Girls"", ""Dixie Dynamite"" or ""The Great Texas Dynamite Chase"", which are about pairs of women or in one case, female outlaw gangs with four women. However, in Thelma and Lousie, we got this depressing story that puts down both men and women and creates a very depressing outlook. The movie mad me mad and depressed, so I have only seen it once, as opposed to the dozens of times I watched, the three movies above.In Thelma and Louise, men are all rapists, criminals or just plain super pigs, except the super sensitive character played by Harvey Keitel, who would have been perfect character for a Norman Lear television show or to guest host on Donohue.I also found the portrayal of men, very unrealistic. The type guys that I hung with that like to fight (fight club types) are not presented in this, and you know they are out there, because there are streets you might not want to walk down tonight. Normal everyday hard working and decent men are not presented either. As stated the men are presented very negative.The women, well Thelma and Louise are also presented negative. They are copy cats. They act and react to those evil men around them, by copying the way men act. They even quote precise diologue taught by Brad Pitt's Character TJ when robbing a bank, after he robs them.The movie says loudly, men who are all evil will be copied by women, so we have a lot of evil, all around.",Thelma & Louise
122,Doublej20005,An Excellent Film,9,2 April 2021,"Extremely good. Good writing, great score, strong characters and a sense of timeliness that I couldn't have had if I'd watched this a few weeks ago. Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis are both fantastic, and sold their characters really well. Despite the many crimes they committed, I really found myself rooting for them to succeed, and I think that's a testament to just how well written the main characters are. They're given a lot of time during the film to become their own people, and it is really fun to watch play out. Brad Pitt was a scene stealer, the direction is solid all round - the film on the whole is just really really enjoyable. I think they should've given Harvey Keitel and the rest of the cops less screentime - that might have tightened the pacing a tad and allowed more of the focus to be on T+L. But that's not that big of an issue in the bigger picture. It's an overall fantastic film, and is strongly recommendable.",Thelma & Louise
123,MovieJunkie5,Thelma & Louise,7,6 May 2020,"Thelma & Louise tells a story about two women going on a journey rediscovering themselves and to get away from the problems at home. From the very beginning it stands out from other movies, being two women going on an adventure / road trip instead of two men and quickly things turn sour and escalate by the minute untill both find themselves in situations they'd never dream to be on. The screenplay is good, it keeps you interested enough and the cast has some great performances, mostly by the two main stars but also Harvey Keitel and Brad Pitt's abs. Jokes aside, it's a great movie to watch and I recommend you go see it!",Thelma & Louise
124,jcanettis,Unimpressive,5,13 February 2005,"Although it had potential, the good cast just couldn't save ""Thelma & Louise"" from mediocrity. The story is about two girls: Thelma (Davis), is an inexperienced girl who is married to an oppressive husband, Darryl (McDonald), and she now longs to enjoy two days of freedom offered to her by her more rebellious friend, Louise (Sarandon). Louise has invited Thelma to spend two days in her boss' house; unfortunately, when they begin their excursion, things turn nasty soon: Somebody tries to rape Thelma, and Louise kills him in her attempt to save her. From that moment on, the two girls have become fugitives. Among those chasing them is Officer Hal (Keitel) who sympathizes with them a little, Darryl, who has become berserk, and Louise's erstwhile lover, Jimmy (Madsen), who wants to make up with her.Although the plot sounds good, it completely fails to deliver. More specifically, the film becomes an incoherent following of the two girls' mischiefs, who become more and more improbable in the passage of time. Despite the director's best intentions, the viewer has difficulty in empathizing with either Thelma or Louise, as their acts do not make any sense from some point onward. The actors deliver an above-average performance, although I would expect more from Harvey Keitel.The film gets just a pass grade, 5/10.",Thelma & Louise
125,duraflex,The only good thing in this film is the '66 Thunderbird,2,15 December 2005,"Not a pleasant film. Definitely a male bashing film.There is little to like about Thelma and Louise. They hate their lives and instead of doing something to improve them, they take off on a road trip that soon turns into a running nightmare including murder, armed robbery, attacking a cop and blowing up a fuel truck.The saddest moment is when that beautiful T-Bird goes sailing off into oblivion. What a waste of such a beautiful car. Of course, the women are in the car at the time and their road trip ends in their untimely death.They could have found better lives with a different approach.Of course, that kind of message movie would have been a lot harder to write and probably drawn a smaller audience.Instead we got the violence and hopelessness that is Thelma & Louise.I only decided to finally watch this movie because Geena Davis is so good at playing the U.S. President in the ABC network TV drama ""Commander in Chief"".Now I wish I had not seen this film. It will be hard to disassociate her from the miserable character she portrays in T&L.",Thelma & Louise
126,tmpj,"It is a ""chick-flick""...but it is well done....",6,16 November 2010,"This is a story where, when you stand up for yourself, everything seems to go wrong. Thelma and Louise are two ordinary types...one a housebound wife, the other a worldy-wise restaurant waitress. They decide to make a get-away for the week-end. Thelma, the more timid of the two, does not ask her husband, knowing he has a short fuse. But they head out just the same. At a road stop, Thelma is almost raped in the parking lot by some guy from inside the bar. Louise steps in, with the pistol neither has used..but which they brought along for protection...and stops the rapist. They try to go on their way, but the rapist mouths off with profanities and insults galore. Louise gets ticked, and shoots and kills the would-be rapist...and they make their escape. The rest of the film deals with how they handle themselves in the face of adversity. Their belief is that they can't get any fair treatment or justice, and they were probably right to some extent. But, afterall, the guy would have raped Thelma if Louise had not intervened. But now, Thelma and Louise are wanted criminals on the run, and the action escalates to the point where they no longer resemble the simple people they were at the beginning of this story. In a way, the story takes on an anti-male tone but, to their credit, their actions are taken mostly against those guys who have exhibited some real ""cave-man"" type of behavior. Soon, Thelma and Louise are committing crimes as a matter of survival...and not just simple solicitation, either. It was an interesting watch, because of the sympathetic portrayal of two ordinary people who just got in over their heads. And after they had passed a certain point, it was simply too late to turn back...to their way of thinking. This is a surprisingly good film, and how Sarandon and Davis both lost out on the Academy Awards to--of all people--Jodie Foster ,is a mystery that stupify Sherlock Holmes. One more thing, Harvey Keitel is woefully miscast as a southern police detective. He cannot shed his Brooklyn accent or New York attitude, and he just does not come off as believable in this vehicle. This may be the worst performance--or the worst casting--for Keitel that I have seen. He is otherwise very good in the roles that he plays. Other than that, this is an OK film and it merits a watch.",Thelma & Louise

Why are men the heroes and women the prostitutes, murderers, and hookers? They asked, well, this is just as guilty of such treason with such neo-feminist malarkey posing as a thriller. Here, the men are depicted as low-lives, perverts, rapists, abusers, boozers, murderers, robbers, and wussies while the women are heroes! Puh-lease. Thelma and Louise is an unrealistic melodramatic waste of time. They kill a man for unjustifiably and sadistically, rob a store for no reason, and taunt others, while we're supposed to root for them? Give me a break. In a modern age of feminists who want to depict women as heroes and men as simpering morons, this just takes the cake as a real waste of time. It's just ridiculous.

The general theme appeared first and best in ""Vanishing Point"" (1971) but there is plenty of originality with this. The screenplay is pretty good although I have a problem with Louise shooting the would-be rapist simply because he was insulting her - surely while holding him at gunpoint she would get Thelma to call the police? You don't just shoot people because you don't like them. And things get silly at the end, but not irritatingly so.

Sexually assaulted outside of a bar, Davis' character is aided by Sarandon in an outlaw escape from patriarchy.

133,middleburg,Characters to love and embrace,10,9 January 2005,"There are endless moments in this film that are classic. Susan Sarandon and Gina Davis light up the screen like a couple of supernovas. With disarming smiles, accents, mannerisms and personas, watching them act together is like watching Astaire and Rogers. They complement each other, counter each other, are SO unbelievably entertaining and real in their emotions, raw, powerful and honest. It is a tour de force of an acting ensemble quite unlike any other in American Cinema. And what an entertaining movie! We are taken on this road trip, we are tossed around, made to grimace in repulsion, made to laugh helplessly, made to watch in amazement not knowing what next to expect--it is entertainment on such a grand level. Feminist? Sure! Is it only for women? No way! Susan's heart-breakingly real beau and Harvey Keitel's sincere caring detective--they more than counteract the boorishness of some of the male characters. My favorite moments: The line-dancing at the pivitol roadhouse bar, Brad Pitt's description of how to do a holdup and his surprisingly erotic seduction of Gina Davis, the stoned bicycle rider, the final freeze-frame and white out, Susan Sarandon asking Jimmy what are the color of her eyes, Gina Davis' declaration of independence....I could go on and on.

134,Supachewy,A Great Original Crime Drama,8,8 December 2010,"The crime drama Thelma & Louise is directed by Ridley Scott and stars Susan Sarandon, Geena Davis, Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, and Brad Pitt. The film takes place in modern day Arkansas.Thelma (Davis) and Louise (Sarandon) are best friends and really need to go on a trip to escape the pressures of everyday life. Thelma's husband is extremely controlling and does not value her at all, so she is reluctant at first to go on the trip but eventually accepts. Louise's boyfriend Jimmy (Madsen) is a cool guy that really loves Louise and it is safe to say that if Louise doesn't love him she definitely feels quite strongly about him. While the two are at a bar Thelma gets quite drunk and a man tries to take advantage of her in the parking lot. Well when everything comes to an end Louise shoots the man to protect Thelma but they must go on the run. Can a police detective, Hal (Keitel), solve the murder and put the women in prison? Or will they escape the grasp of the law and make it to Mexico? The screenplay for this film by Callie Khouri is very original and a great twist to the crime genre. While watching the film you really get a sense for the characters and their personalities, and they never do anything outside of their character. On the surface it is just a basic do a crime and run type of film but with the added characterization and the relationships the characters have with their husband/boyfriend it adds another layer to the film. One thing that bothered me about this was its resemblance to Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid in the plot loosely and the finale loosely as well.Ridley Scott is one of the best directors Hollywood has to offer and this is a film that shows his range as a director. At the time he is really known for great science fiction films like Alien and Blade Runner but he decided to mix it up with this one and I love it when directors spice it up. Like usual he has many great shots which develop the characters of the film allowing the audience to really know and become attached to Thelma and Louise. Now is this one of Scott's best films? Certainly not. But it is definitely worth noting when talking about his impressive career.Susan Sarandon really shines in this film as the role of Louise, and the film put her on the map. Before this film she was known but after she became a superstar who went on to win an Oscar. With this film she showed her talent and earned an Oscar nomination as well as a woman who wants to just take a break and have some fun, but obviously that isn't what she gets. Her facial and voice expressions in this film were absolutely remarkable and this is definitely my favorite film I've seen her in even though I have not seen much of her repertoire.Geena Davis delivers a superb performance also earning an Oscar nomination for her role as Thelma. She was fun, cute girl escaping from her husband and having a good time even after she almost got raped. Her accent was great and the chemistry between her and Sarandon was absolutely wonderful. It is a shame that her career never became anything more than this, the only film I can remember her in after this is with Michael J. Fox in Stuart Little. She is definitely a great talent and I would love to see her come back into the spotlight.The supporting cast did a decent job as well, but nowhere near as good as the leads. I was kind of disappointed by Harvey Keitel as a nice guy detective. It didn't feel like he gave much of a performance, just put on a sympathetic voice when talking to the women. Michael Madsen is always good and he was in this as well, though he was not magnificent or anything. I always respect Michael Madsen because he is a working man actor whose name isn't big but still gets around. He is still kind of a tough guy in this and he is not as good as he is in Reservoir Dogs or Donnie Brasco but this was earlier in his career and he grew as an actor. The film features Brad Pitt's first major role as a cute guy thief and he does a decent job. Nothing good really but for a first major film definitely not bad.Overall I give this film an 8/10 and I recommend it to anyone who likes crime films, films with female leads, and original films. It is fun at parts and the ending is a classic, and you kind of have to see it if you have any liking for Ridley Scott.",Thelma & Louise

Aside from the absolutely compelling performances by Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis, the prescient condemnation of male abuse of women is amazingly timely. When I first saw this film, when it came out in 1991, I thought the Geena Davis character was a jerk, always getting Louise in trouble.

Both Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis give superb performances. The soundtrack is cool, too. Being a guy, I can't see how some claim this movie is not for them because it portrays two women setting themselves free of a life where their hubbies were making all decisions without even asking their wives. Any bloke seeing this movie and feeling attacked or disappointed hasn't really gotten into it, sorry to say. Open your mind, ok? It was a time a movie put male chauvinists where they deserve.The only aspect I don't like is the end. If it was up to me the last scene would have been the two women coming to Mexico in the sunset.

We see the two female leads stick together through a strong bond of friendship, and Pitt helps things with his small role but believable slick cowboy/robber type.As Thelma and Louise decide to really up the ante and go on a bit of a crime spree we can really see by bringing up their past how they have got to this stage, Thelma's no good husband and Louise's abuse in Texas, which of course explains the first crime she does.To think I could have missed a great movie, something needed to be done to improve the first part.

You could drive through the country and meet people just like all of the people in this film. There's the man trying to make himself better (Madsen) through coming to grips with his true feelings for a small town waitress. A young drifter only looking out for himself (Pitt). A husband who doesn't appreciate his wife until she is gone (McDonald). A guy who never stops believing (Keitel) in women. And a few guys that weren't raised right (Carhart, St. John 'the truck driver', and Pitt again). It was honest here.And, the film was honest about it's main characters Thelma (Davis) and Louise (Sarandon). Here were two women driven, away from every aspect of their lives and over a cliff. Neither one was perfect, yet both new right from wrong and expressed that, down to Thelma littering to Louise shooting someone. Louise never got mad at Thelma although she had good reason and vice versa. Despite their wrongs, they had each other up to the last moment.

141,aciolino,Thelma and Louise Review,1,11 June 2008,"I felt compelled to add a comment here as I was coerced to watch this film again after having not seen it since its initial release. My lady friend insisted that my dislike for the film would change and that my first viewing (I left the theater nauseus with anger) was with a jaundiced eye.Well, I'm here to say that either my eye is more jaundiced than ever or this really is pretentious tripe. No, this really IS pretentious tripe. In the theater I applauded Thelma and Louise's choice of self-immolation; NOT because I so deeply felt their pain and hopelessness, but simply to rid the world of two self-absorbed, nasty, narcissistic losers. Brought to you by the folks who brought you the end of Western Civilization the message here is: it is better to die than to live having to buy dresses off the rack or Donna Karan knock-offs. It is better to kill oneself than to work with aid's patients, teach poor children to read, aid the disenfranchised, or do anything for humanity. No, your victimhood is FAR more important and ultimately the measuring stick by which you should judge your ultimate existence. Good Lord. Thelma and Louise are dead, and we are to see them as tragic figures instead of badly written screen characters with no redeeming values or reason to live.Tripe.",Thelma & Louise
142,k844140,Don't understand what's so feminist about it,8,26 October 2021,"Everybody here tells how feminist this movie is, but I see it in a different way. There is no ""Girl power"" or anything of that kind, it's just a story about two women. Male characters are not distorted as they are in modern real feminist movies like Birds of Prey. Harvey Keitel played a surprisingly good cop. I expected him to be a typical maniac-like policeman who would use any means to catch usual criminals as though they are the most wanted in the whole world. Main characters' husband and boyfriend are not typical oppressors either. Thelma's husband is a frequent type who wants his wife to stay at home while he's at work. He also makes Thelma more motivated to do what she does further in the film, since she's bored with her daily routine. Louise's boyfriend is a type of guys who is tough outside but sensitive inside. Harlan and J. D. are just criminals who make the story develop. The only odd male character is the policeman who stops the two women on the road. He could be made less freaky.Thelma & Louise seems like an analogue of Bonnie & Clyde but with several differences. It's about two women rather than man and woman, and they begin their criminal ""career"" accidentally rather than intentionally and at first, they just want to escape from the punishment. Speaking of the screenplay, it's magnificent, everything works just perfect. All the characters look so real and good written, as well as the story itself. The screenwriter really deserved her Oscar. Directing and cinematography are great either. And of course, the cast, especially the two leading actresses. The ending which some people don't like is fine for me. Though some people say it look unnatural that after all this running away they just commit suicide, it doesn't look that odd. Look at Thelma at the beginning and in the end of the movie, for instance. She doesn't look like robbing stores and assaulting people in the first part of the movie, but she does so later. So if the creators decided to make this ending, I don't object.",Thelma & Louise
143,jennifer_litchfield,Star rating: 5 out of 5,10,17 January 2003,"Thelma & Louise is one of those unfortunately all too rare movie gems which really engages the viewer.  Watch it with a good friend and you'll find yourselves energised by the zest for life displayed by Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon in their stand out performances.  Like Thelma and Louise, you'll want to ditch your jobs for the weekend and beg, borrow or steal a classic convertible car, before setting off on a road trip adventure along the USA's dusty mid-western highways.The premise of the film is simple - put two ordinary people in an extraordinary situation and watch what happens as events start to snowball. Davis's bored housewife and Sarandon's diner-waitress are typical of thousands of women the world over.  A chance encounter on the way to a run-of-the-mill weekend holiday in the mountains starts a chain of happenstance that thrusts the two friends into a situation where there are no signposts and no rules.      Thelma & Louise is often classified as a 'chick flick', but this is perhaps somewhat misleading.  Certainly it is true that this is a film about two women, and the men in the story are shown as ineffectual or lacking in understanding (although watch for an entertaining appearance by Brad Pitt which is regarded as his breakthrough role).  However one of the main themes dealt with is the emotive and perennially grey area surrounding attempted rape and how the reporting of it is dealt with - this is clearly not the fluff and insubstantiality usually associated with chick flicks.  However, despite this and despite the outcome of the film (which on one level could be viewed as tragic), the brilliant and insightful cinematography of Ridley Scott leaves the viewer upbeat and with a tremendous sense of freedom.",Thelma & Louise
144,Neonsamurai,"I tried watching with my ears, but I got tinitus.",4,16 October 2002,"I'm no expert on women, but there are some things that you just don't do. You don't say things like; `Yes, she is prettier than you', `But you are fat' and especially `I think Thelma and Louise is stupid.'  So in light of this I have decided NOT to mock this film, as it will make me enemies.
Instead I'm going to suggest how it could have been better (CONTAINS SPOLIERS):Firstly, I found all the male characters unrealistic. I mean, if I were married to Geena Davis, I'd pay her more attention and might even be a bit afraid of her. My friend Dave told me that she's 7 foot tall, but he also told me he was in MI6, so it might not be trueAlso a lot of people complained about how stupid the ladies were in this film, but I think that's unfair. People make stupid mistakes all the time. Only last week I decided that All you need is love' and didn't buy my girlfriend a birthday present as my love would surely be enough When I got out of hospital I realised that I'd been stupid, but you learn by your mistakes. The next time the Thelma and Louise shot a potential rapist, they could use a silencer or make sure that no one found the body, and thereby learning by their mistakes.Another thing is that I've tried shooting at petrol tankers and they don't explode. Well, when I say shoot, I mean throw rocks at them, but either way no huge fireball. Perhaps instead it could have been a truck full of nuns, who had an oxyacetylene gas cylinder inside. That would go up with a real bang! Instead of lewd gestures, the nuns could have been singing All things bright and beautiful' except in the wrong key. That'd be a good reason to open fire.Finally I thought that the ending was too downbeat. If I had written it, I'd have had the two ladies stop at the edge of the cliff, and Geena's husband could run up and say: `I forgive you darling. Look, I've brought you a TV for the kitchen so now you won't feel so lonely, and we'll pay someone to do the ironing.' She'd of course see that he was trying to make her happy and fall in love with him again. And Harvey Keitel could have married Susan Sarandon and then made sure all the charges got dropped. Hooray! Everyone's a winner!",Thelma & Louise

It's that very last scene, just before the fade to white, that sets me off. It's not because it's sad, I find it so beautiful. Thelma (Geena Davis) lives her whole life in the 2 days depicted in this film, and she dies a happy woman.

147,brimon28,A spiritual journey?,10,25 January 2013,"Two decades later, Thelma & Louise continues to absorb our attention. We can analyze it, admire the acting, praise the cutting, remember the story. But that doesn't tell us why it remains such a cult movie. And not just the feminists, who claimed ownership. Its appeal is universal, and I believe it is because it is laden with symbolism that engages those who, deep down, have a mystical experience. The main symbol is water. To many, water means baptism, purification, cleansing. T & L, throughout, shows water in many forms. Washing, of course, but there's irrigation, wet paving and rain. It appears at crucial times. Watch for the women as they wash hands and faces; note the changes in the drama.Would the Bard have approved? I think Shakespeare would have loved this story. It has his kind of ending, his kind of humor, his kind of 'cast-reduction plan'. It is a very funny film. OK, some of the humor is too targeted to the stupidity of the men. Is that why some feminists like it? But there are some comedic lines and risible clichés. Those of a religious bent will recognize the dramatic elements of purification, retribution and revelation. When the women stop to admire the view over the canyon, do they experience that moment of glory to which many of a certain belief aspire? Their faces, their embrace, tell us that. If you want to analyze, note the moment when Thelma adopts the leadership role. Drama is about change; this has it in spades. This feminist came out of the hard-top smiling 20 years ago. In 2013, my third viewing, T & L is still a great movie.",Thelma & Louise

Everything else he had directed was terrible, but this movie in particular is his definitive worst.Replace ""Thelma and Louise"" with two guys, say ""Frank and Bill"", and you would have the most sexist movie on the planet.  But since it's two women, they get away with all the male-bashing you can take.*Spoiler Alert*When Geena Davis picked up Brad Pitt, I knew that he was going to rob her blind the morning after.  I guess she was too stupid and guy-struck to realize this, though.  I damn near jumped out of my seat and cheered when her and her equally-idiotic friend drove off the cliff.  Two less idiots in the world makes a happy ending for me!  Now why not cut out the first seven-eighths of the movie out, just show us the suicide run, and you'd have a pretty good movie.  Hell, if might just win best picture.  Of course, then the movie would have to be named ""The Death of Two Morons"".",Thelma & Louise
150,angie-27,a great film,10,4 April 1999,"This is one of my all time favorite movies, for many reasons.  The first is obvious: the cast.  It's too bad even though Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis were both nominated for Oscars that both of them couldn't win.  I think they both deserved it.  Their performances are the strongest things about the movie.  And the supporting cast is also great, especially Harvey Kietel.  I also like seeing  Stephen Tobolowski (Stephen who?).  And I love the ending. Unlike most people, who thinks it's sad, I can't imagine them ending it any other way.  If Thelma and Louise had been caught, that would have sucked. But if they had gotten away from the cops, it would have seemed contrived and unoriginal.  But having them drive off the cliff was the best possible way to end it.  It was very liberating and freeing to see them make a decision and end it on their terms.  My score-10.",Thelma & Louise
151,souther02,Daryl the Dipstick,9,23 November 2010,"Darryl, Thelma's husband, is the ultimate dipstick in Thelma and Louise. Not only is he an arrogant drama king, he is dangerous. So Thelma does not let Darryl near the coffeemaker or the microwave. Darryl is bad enough in his own way. The guy in the parking lot is an entirely different species of jerk, and he has no limitations in the way he treats women. So after a slam ""bang"" with the iridescent Thelma, the roughneck or longshoreman is real quiet while Harvey Kietel looks the situation over. By then, Louise and Thelma are heading for better pastures.After Kietel interviewed the waitress, and she makes her final statement about Thelma and Louise, the viewer gets the idea that Louise's experience in Texas was a major motivator. Because the detective is now beyond establishing the fact that one of the women was playing Saturday Night Special with the real thing. So the detective(Kietel) is trying to define a ""clear"" motive for the shooting. Since nobody else seems to be a witness.Enter Jimmy. Louise's boyfriend promises a big bailout for Louise. Must be nice...I mean...anyway. So the two are on their way to meet Jimmy somewhere in Arkansaw. Thelma picks up quite a bit of liquor.The detective on the case is talking to his boss and the idea of ""The Bureau"" comes up and this obviously means the FBI. Thelma and Louise have headed down south. Way down south. Thelma calls the ultimate dipstick(her husband Daryl), which is a mistake even though they are married. Finally Thelma tells Daryl to go do something. Not nice to print it here.Enter Brad Pitt. No name, no number, but a list in several precincts and plenty counties. Pitt becomes a large part of the story, but he teaches Thelma a few things. Soon the two female outlaws are back on the road with a fistful of diamonds.What's great: In a movies listed as comedy, the trucker is pretty hilarious, but severely bombs out with the two outlaws. One who is sweet, kind of flighty, and the other who is nothing but business. Geena Davis is a tall drink of water.",Thelma & Louise

153,denizov,Feminists on the road,7,15 April 2014,"I generally like the on-the-road genre of movies and this film did not disappoint me. It is very feminist, perhaps more than necessary but I like the plot, the camera shots and the play of the two actresses. Their growing self-confidence and their determination to regain their dignity and their own lives even at the cost of death is something that is shown very well, in a convincing way. There is no happy-end, but because of their heroic struggle, I was not depressed at the end. What I did not like was that the tempo was too slow in the first half of the film. And somehow the introduction to the whole story is too long. Also, I think that the film would have been much better if the two leading characters had been more intelligent and deeper. They are too shallow and superficial and this prevents their drama to reach its full potential. In this way the movie becomes less dramatic—this is my point. And probably because of this, the authors have put car chases which are out-of-place in this film. Because this is not an action and should not be! The scene when Louise gives her jewelries to an unknown old man, without the two exchanging even a word struck me as artificial and totally cut off from the plot. There are other small weaknesses but in all, it is a good, moving film which is worth watching.",Thelma & Louise
154,Turin_Horse,Thelma & Louise has by now reached the category of both Classic and Cult Film,9,5 September 2016,"I saw this film at the cinema in 1991, I remember how much I enjoyed it, the great cinematography by R. Scott, the witty and insightful script, and the nearly perfect interpretations of Geena Davis, Susan Sarandon and every other actor/actress on it. I am not one of those who like to re-watch films, instead I prefer to see any new or old previously unseen film. So when I sat in front of the TV this August and started zapping my intention was to check what was on in Sundance Channel, but then I came across Thelma & Louise, and lazily decided to put down the remote. I cannot describe the emotion I felt as I recalled with unexpected precision scene after scene what was going to happen, some exact script lines and even the particular mood and gestures of the actors before they executed some of the scenes. It was then that I realized that film had had an impact on me, few times I have enjoyed that much in a theater, and recently on the TV. The film has not aged just a bit, it is as fresh and delightful as it was 25 years ago; the world has changed quite a lot since then, the humour/drama of the film has not. Thelma & Louise has something to it that makes it a classic, it now belongs to cinema history, and it will become (if this has not happened yet) a cult film reflecting an epoch. There has never been another Thelma & Louise, and there will never be, it seems nobody has even tried to do it, maybe the daring story it tells and the wonderfully crafted way it is told are too challenging to attempt something similar nowadays, and we should be glad for it.",Thelma & Louise

This was in the 90s lots changed till then but back then this was something new and refreshing! I could totally identify myself with them and that's why I find the movie so important. I love the writer and that she spoke openly about the criticism of it being a male bashing movie, which is total nonsense! In fact it's about an amazing friendship between these two women that is very hard to find and them being hurt in the past and not wanting to take it anymore. If you treat women or any one poorly you deserve some kind of punishment. That's what they did, it's not like these men were innocent. Go figure! Forever one of my favorites!!!",Thelma & Louise

Her best friend,Thelma Dickinson on the other hand,is a timid housewife with a male chauvinist husband who sells carpets for a living and is really not much more than a badly behaved teenager in a man's body(and proud of it,to quote Louise:))She merely has to ask for his permission to leave the grounds.One day Louise asks her best friend to come with her to a cabin she has borrowed from her boss,over the weekend.Thelma is reluctant,Darryl isn't home yet and even if he was he probably wouldn't let her go. But Louise persuades her to go anyway,and so she does,leaving nothing but a TV-dinner in the microwave for Darryl and a note. They set off into the sunset in Louise's blue Ford Thunderbird-66 and stops for some drinks at a roadside bar. Thelma's newly found freedom becomes too much for her to handle and the evening ends tragically as Louise takes to desperate actions to save Thelma from a rapist. They are now in a position where they are not likely to be believed if they claim self-defense,since everyone in the bar saw Thelma and the guy making out and dancing together. Louise has to come up with a plan and soon the oppressed housewife Thelma show unexpected potential. Only one man,a police investigator portrayed by Harvey Keitel,shows understanding and compassion for the now very vulnerable women and also sees what lies behind Louise's actions. It's interesting to see how almost all men in the movie,even those who are benevolent and mean well(such as Harvey Keitel's police officer),show patronizing tendencies...A classic movie about friendship in general and between women in particular.A must-see if you like.",Thelma & Louise

It's about two fugitives, people on the run, who keep getting themselves into one mess after another.I don't think of this as a feminist chick flick, but a story of two women who deal with things that have happened to them in the best way they can. Geena Davis as Thelma, does a very good performance, as a meek woman with an overbearing husband, who finds herself with newfound freedom, albeit quite naive and trusting, even after what happened to her.Susan Sarandon shines in this movie as well as Louise, a woman with a boyfriend who turns out to be not so bad of a guy.

Eleven years later, I still do. It's an absolutely perfect film and I would not change a thing about it. The story is compelling, but a mere description of the plot does not do the film justice because one cannot simply recount the friendship that is at the heart of the film. It must be seen to be believed. It is an utterly  touching, moving and heartfelt friendship that marks this film and takes it to heights few films can ever reach. Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon embody their characters with such conviction that they become Thelma and Louise. Both earned well-deserved Oscar nominations for Best Actress. By the time they are clasping hands at the end of the film, their T-bird speeding toward a freer and more uninhibited existence, I am sure everyone will be moved because of how well these women and their friendship have been depicted. The screenplay, which won an Oscar, is absolutely brilliant and makes it seem as though the road movie is an altogether new film genre. The film suffered much criticism in 1991 (despite strong reviews) because of what many saw as its sexists message, and it even made the cover of Time, with Davis and Sarandon on the cover and a caption that read ""Thelma and Louise: why it strikes a nerve."" I think it's good that it got the attention, since it probably helped it at the box-office, but I do not think this is an anti-male, feminist film. Keitel's cop character as well as Madsen's boyfriend character are both quite nice and helpful to the girls. Everyone should give this film a try as it is not just a girls-gone-bad chick flick. There is no such thing as a chick flick or a guy flick. Only good and bad flicks. And this one is good indeed.

The story went like a straight line, it got somewhere, not taking detours. This movie was about two girls, one who seemed to be a housewife with an asshole husband who mistreated here (Didn't get the impression he physically abused her) but was never home, worked a lot and we rude to her). The other girl was a very distant girl who seemed odd and had been through something bad, it's safe to say that both were unhappy until this trip turned their lives around, at first it was bad, they felt remorse and anxiety but as time went on they started to get used to the ""wild life"" and just being open minded and lived for the moment and developed a very close and open friendship in the end.

165,anteksw,An Effective Mixture of 'Fun' & 'Serious',9,28 February 2015,"Surprisingly, I didn't actually know anything in particular about this film when going into it, the only thing I was aware of was the fact that this film apparently evoked 'female empowerment' and arguably feminist-related views. This initially made me slightly doubtful about the film as a whole, predominantly due to the fact that every ""feminist"" I have ever encountered in real life clearly didn't know what ""equality"" stood for, and therefore I was expecting a somewhat weak plot line and a biased representation of characters (e.g. following the formula of featuring only 'misogynistic males' and 'misunderstood females'). Fortunately, the film does not take this specific route; it instead explores both genders in a respectful manner and furthermore features many more perks which made it utterly enjoyable and unexpectedly compelling.Many elements of this film worked wonderfully for me, mostly the characters and their respective 'quests' and mishaps, as well as of course the journey of our two female protagonists and their 'adventures'. Every occurrence or character action/motive is dealt with either a serious and thought-provoking approach, or with a somewhat ""silly"" and at times genuinely funny approach. Surprisingly, this unusual blend actually works, which is especially surprising as I personally prefer a completely serious approach to important issues represented in film. Additionally, the film is aesthetically pleasing with convincing sets and gorgeous locations throughout, which... is technically one of those features that every road trip movie MUST get right, and this one certainly does. Furthermore, it truly felt like an 80's film, with its delightful, well-fitted and captivating soundtrack, as well as certain scenes creating abrupt yet very effective comedy. Therefore, the film supplied me with a very entertaining and light-hearted tone throughout, whilst simultaneously providing social commentary (in terms of equality for women) in an appropriate manner. The fact 'Thelma & Louise' genuinely felt evocative of the 80s (or at least very early 90s) arguably made the film even more enjoyable for me.There are a few minor negative aspects, but they are so insignificant that they never actually distract from the character or plot development... these are basically 'nitpicks'. There are potentially one or two scenes in which Geena Davis' acting felt unconvincing, there is one scene which felt slightly forced only to further expand on the social commentary, and Michael Madsen's character seemed to lack exposition. However, despite the nitpicking, it's safe to say that all of the acting maintained a great standard throughout, and all of the characters contributed to the film's entertainment value significantly. To conclude, 'Thelma & Louise' is an impressively crafted film that effectively blends 'seriousness' with 'fun' whilst never distracting from the film's plot OR overall message/social commentary. It is simultaneously an incredibly enjoyable and thought-provoking film with stellar performances all-round, I highly recommend it to everyone.",Thelma & Louise

It's almost 25 years since ""Thelma & Louise"" hit the big screen in May 1991and instantly became a hit, with sublimely paired performances by Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis. Callie Khouri won the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay. T&L has big bawdy action, two all-American rough-and-ready heroines— Sarandon shoots the bad guy in the chest, just like that, a righteous shoot if ever there was one—and a searing final scene that tears your heart out. T&L is crazy and unbelievable, with a sophomoric silliness about the plot twists, and the spectacular you-didn't-see-it-coming ending that defies straight thinking. I think T&L is a captivating invitation to do some serious out-of- the-box sympathizing with two women who finally get some potent excitement in their lives, who are tired of getting the crappy end of the stick, who know with depressing exactitude just exactly where they were going right and just exactly where they went wrong, who understand that Harvey the cop wants to help them, who realize that the only help they're going to get is from each other, who finally understand that holding hands and pedal-to-the-metal is as good as it gets. I think ""Thelma & Louise"" demands respect, I think it gives every viewer a chance to think hard about what's-good-in-my-life, I think it opens a window for every viewer to imagine what it would be like to finally have it all, with someone you love, if ever so briefly, even in mid-air.

172,WinterOf63,Why Did Louise Give Their Location Away?,8,22 November 2020,"How many times in this movie did Louise berate Thelma for giving their whereabouts away? Remember when she had Thelma call her husband? She told her over and over ""if anything doesn't seem right, hang up right away because that means the cops are there""? Then she calls home to talk to the cop she knows is there and stays on the line long enough for them to trace the call, which seals their doom! That was frustrating.Still, this is an entertaining movie. It's not a great movie by any stretch, but one that is fun to watch. It was especially fun to watch Thelma's ""growth"" from shy, beaten-down housewife to a Bonnie Parker-like wild woman. The ending ranks up there with ""Butch Cassidy"" in the memorable category. Ebert said he would have given it four stars except for the flashbacks after they fly off the cliff. I guess I'm not that picky.",Thelma & Louise

I don't say that is the good thing what they were doing but the good thing about it is freedom of breaking rules without any worries, knowing exactly how it will end.

176,corazontvc,An iconic film about friendship,9,7 July 2015,"This is a movie for everyone, not just women. I don't understand why a movie that stars mostly white males, like 'The Right Stuff', is expected to be enjoyed by everyone including women, but when the leads are women only other women are expected to enjoy it. I am NOT white male bashing here, it's just that the assumption is annoying. Having said that, this is a movie that does speak to women in a way that men can't comprehend. I have had the pleasure of seeing with other women who are watching this for the first time, and the reaction has been powerful without exception. On to the movie.Many women were considered for these roles, including Jodie Foster and Jessica Lange. These were parts that many women in Hollywood instinctively knew were incredible. Callie Khouri, the script writer, said she thought of the entire movie in one night and just wrote it down, like taking dictation. Geena Davis originally wanted to be Louise, and pleaded with the director Ridley Scott to try and get the part. When Susan Sarandon auditioned, Geena thought to herself, ""Oh, that's Louse. She had such a commanding, self-assured presence, I thought 'what was I thinking?'"" Callie originally didn't want Ridley, she didn't believe a male director could pull it off. He reminded her of another visionary movie that he made, Alien, featuring Sigourney Weaver as the lead. She agreed. The rest is history.There are many great scenes in this film, but my favorite are two scenes in sequence. It is night, and they have just passed a truck driver they have scene repeatedly, he is an ass. Cut to the daytime, Thelma is a bit toasted, and starts laughing and talking about how it was hilarious how Louise blew away her rapist. Louise says 'Thelma, that's not funny''. Thelma says that's what happened to you, right? In Texas? Louise forcefully tells her to mind her own business. Thelma submissively complies. Earlier, Thelma had robbed a store with great authority, and now we wonder, if anything has really changed. Throughout the journey, it is Louise that has carried the naive non-streetwise Thelma. They soon get stopped by a cop for speeding. This is bad. They'll be taken in when he finds out they're fugitives. He takes Louise to his car and has her sit in the front seat. As he picks up his radio, Thelma intervenes, with a gun. The look on Louise's face says it all, Thelma has been transformed. The best line of the movie is spoken here. The officer pleads with Thelma before he is forced into the trunk, Thinking he is about to get killed he says ' Please I have a wife and kids!"" Thelma says 'You do? Well, you're lucky. You be sweet to them, especially your wife. My husband wasn't sweet to me, and look how I turned out.' Brilliant scenes.This project had many powerful supporting members. From the nice score by Hans Zimmer, to the powerful performance by Harvey Keitel, everyone chosen for the project was excellent at what they did. But that does not matter if the lead actors don't have it. And at that point in time, in this movie, it was Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis that made this movie an icon. No one else could have pulled it off.The only quibbles I have with this movie is the choice of music. Not the score, which is quite beautiful and evocative of the American Southwest, but the songs they chose. It does not stand the test of time, very cheesy 80's music, which I hate with a passion. Other than that, watch this movie, and enjoy the ride.BTW, ever since IMDb went to their new system of logging in, I have been unable to, and had to re-register. I have been a member since 2007 under 'abbywts', but now have to start all over. Thanks for nothing IMDb. Way to invade privacy.

I believed nearly all of it:  why they fled instead of going to the cops (this comes out over the course of the film), and why things were escalating the way they were.  All of the actions taken by T & L were directly related to the changing of their characters.Two complaints:  First, I did not buy Louise's final phone call to the police.  She knew the phone was tapped; even if she HAD to call to settle in her mind the question of how severe the situation was, she did not seem to be urgent at all.  This and the whole bit with the obnoxious fuel trucker just seemed like useless flag-waving for feminism.  I am quite convinced that, even with the changes these two were going through, once J.D. had taken the money, or perhaps once Thelma had robbed the store, these two would have had a serious tete-a-tete and established that they needed to lay low and get serious about fleeing.  What actually happens is they seem to dilly-dally even more.

Also, it didn't hurt that story felt raw and realistic - no crazy fighting scenes or miracle solutions. On the other hand, and I'm well aware that this is no argument, the whole movie was, in a way, off - as if the glue that was supposed to keep all these great parts together wasn't there (if that makes any sense). And it certainly didn't help that I couldn't stand Thelma - and while I can't really blame her for the thing that happened to her at the very beginning of the movie, which also put the plot in motion, try and convince me that she wasn't making things harder for Louise throughout the movie.With respect to everything I just wrote, there is a reason this movie is considered a classic and I wholeheartedly believe that you should not skip the next opportunity to see/stream it.",Thelma & Louise

186,moviefan-50,A truly breathtaking and heartbreaking film,10,2 July 2000,"First of all, I am a male, and I just have to say this movie truly touched me inside. I know what it is to have that struggle with other people and truly admire the characters for what they did and refusing to give up, even in the end, because they drove off the cliff instead of surrendering once again to the male-dominated world. Why this movie only got 1 Oscar, I will never know, but it certainly deserved Best Picture and more. Thelma and Louise did get the Best Screenplay Oscar, which was definitely well deserved. There are many qualities to a good movie: among them, is a good script, good acting, good background/setting, good music, among other things. The script was superb, absolutely amazing and touching how these 2 friends stood up for each other and were going to be there for each other all the way to the end. The acting was SENSATIONAL, both Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis gave absolutely stunning performances, no flaws, beautifully done, ladies! As for the setting: Could it be any more beautiful? Set in the Mid-US where there are exceptionally beautiful canyons and scenery..... and the music! I loved Hans Zimmers' haunting guitar music, which was glorious, especially in the final few moments of the moment before they made that historic drive over the cliff. The ending was amazing also...that drive over the cliff to show that these 2 brave women will never ever be confined by men again...plus the clips of happier moments of the pair in the past that followed were simply ingenious! That is why I am proud to call Thelma and Louise my favorite movie of all time.

188,margielove,Margaret Reines: Great Female road trip,10,30 October 2013,"The film struck a strong chord with (mainly) female audiences - I suspect. - possibly as a compensatory device for the many films which portray females as the recipients of action rather its perpetrators. Probably it has/had a cult following for this very reason. One can imagine the woman stuck in not-so-domestic bliss fantasizing about taking off on a road trip. I have done it myself - though not lately. I think the picture would certainly be not so appealing without a very interesting and compelling musical track wherein somehow the producers were able to 'match' songs with particular scenes. eg the section where they were going thru the mountain played the evocative 'Ballad of Lucy Jordan' departing from the full-on honky-tonk blue collar' feel of the film to a sensitive harmonious esoteric experience. Another point of interest is the co-dependence of Thelma and Lousie 'to get them thru the night' as it were. eg when one dithers - the other takes over - and they interchange roles by doing this (a sort of survival thing.)Christopher McDonald was wonderful and added a lot of unintentional humour, eg in the first conversation with Hal Slocumbe, Harvey Keitel's laughing was genuine. I loved the ending.",Thelma & Louise
189,seamysmama,Feminist Fairytale,3,23 February 2019,"I recently revisited this movie since my cable provider is playing it in heavy rotation, and I found myself thinking at one point ""it's only halfway over?!"" I mean, I've seen the movie one hundred times before (who hasn't), and I had always remembered liking it, but now that I'm older, I find a lot of it trite and full of boring cliches that I just don't find entertaining anymore. And why does it seem to take a damn month to get to Mexico, and they still only make it to the Grand Canyon? What's up with that? Thelma's husband is a caricature of all the neglectful, boorish husbands you'll find on any Lifetime movie, and Thelma is the ditzy, oppressed housewife with the best friend who just gives her ""ideas"" about boorish husbands (from the husband point of view), and they all suck. Of course, in the world view of this cinematic journey, there are only two choices: live in a world where men are evil and women have no control over their own destiny, or don't live in this world, choosing instead to become outlaws and then kill ourselves in protest. Hmmm. The scene where Thelma is almost raped at the bar is terrible, and when Louise shoots the lout, he gets his just desert. But as Thelma states later, they could have claimed self defense, and there aren't any witnesses, so why the outlaw road trip? Oh right, because Louise has baggage from an assault she apparently suffered from in her past, so we can't trust the law either (well, that's probably true, but it's still just a plot device). I mean, robbing a convenience store and putting a cop in the trunk of his cruiser? In the beginning of the movie, Thelma wouldn't have known how to survive camping, their original vacation plan. Now she's wielding pistols, day drinking, and sleeping with Brad Pitt! All of this would only happen in a twisted fairytale, which is all it is. If you think this is a piece of feminist art, you're fooling yourself. If this were turned around, and it was a couple of dudes pulling these shenanigans, you'd be pissed at how stupid they were, and deride them for being a couple of jerks. Since it's two women though, we're supposed to sing ""go sister, go!"" I don't think so.",Thelma & Louise
190,Hansda_Sowvendra_Shekhar,A Must-watch,10,28 March 2009,"My god! I wasn't expecting Thelma to do what she did to that licentious truck driver who had been making funny gestures at Louise and her. When they pointed their guns at him, I was expecting Louise to shoot him dead. Like she shot Harlan. And I was quite sure she would do it for what had happened to her in Texas was now known. Anyways, I was also expecting both the women to spare him because they had already been charged for homicide and they knew it. So I was like maybe they won't shoot another man, they are just going to rob him of all his money and clothes and stuff and give his truck some flat tyres and drive away. And then I was also expecting each one to pump at least 2-3 bullets into that man. But then, what Thelma did was incredible. She shot at the tyres, Louise shot at the tyres too. And then Thelma does the unthinkable. She shoots at the oil tanker and blows it up. That was that was amazing.But then, THELMA & LOUISE is amazing. Every moment of it. What these girls do on the run, their encounter with other people, the things they talk, everything makes up for a superior movie-watching experience. Some scenes and lines are so fresh in my mind. I liked the final Grand Canyon scene. It was evident that neither Thelma nor Louise had seen the Grand Canyon before and had just heard about it. The look on their faces tells it all. This scene is quite ironical because it sort of gives away the ending. It sort of tells the viewer that after coming so far, after having the drive of their lives, after seeing this spectacular Grand Canyon, these girls are of course not going to give up, not going to return. And that is what happens.The lines, I think, are quote-worthy. Lines like  ""when a woman's crying like that she isn't having any fun"", ""Think you've found your calling? Maybe, the call of the wild"", ""You be sweet to your wife, my husband wasn't sweet so look how I turned out"" and ""looks like the army, all this for us"" stay in mind long after the film is over and they keep coming back even after days and make one smile and thoughtful.Thelma's transformation from an un-worldly-wise housewife to a woman who learns to take control of situations (and her life) and also rob a store after being 'properly laid' then duped by JD is both humorous and tragic. I liked the scene between Louise and Jimmy in the hotel room. Jimmy has flown across three states to see Louise and Louise doesn't want to return to him. I like how Louise pulls Jimmy's head and they kiss. Plus, the tension between Louise and Jimmy in one room and Thelma having the sex of her life with JD in another room have been put together with nice effect. There's a couple trying to bring their love-life on track in one room, and there's a runaway housewife having a wild romp with a good-looking stranger in another room.THELMA & LOUISE may be about friendship. But it is also about learning to face things, learning to take control, about standing up to something wrong or undesirable, and it is about emancipation. A great story, told very effectively. And, yes, photographed excellently.",Thelma & Louise
191,Apologi,Thelma & Louise: Feminist sexual fantasy?,6,30 December 2014,"Bought the movie from a pile of discount DVDs as the name carried some good reputation. I was expecting a crime flick in the style of Bonnie and Clyde, but the film proved a great disappointment.First of all, Thelma and Louise might have been striking if it had been filmed in 1960's. However, for the modern times, with all expressed consent legislation and no means no laws, the premise that law enforcement would not believe a woman's claim of having been raped is simply not at all believable. The burden of proving innocence lies solely on the man. Nevertheless, this supposed female oppression forms the basic premise of the film. Unfortunately it does not simply work anymore in a legal system dominated by feminism.Rather than from the point of victimhood, the movie should be in my opinion seen as a feminist fantasy of violence and sexuality. From the point of the shooting onwards the movie tears away from realism. The two deepest wishes of the women are fulfilled: Louise is asked the question and offered the ring by her long time boyfriend, and Thelma befriends a young and exciting bad boy hitchhiker, having great sex with him. With their emancipation from the conventional bounds of morality the women actualize their deepest dreams and desires. This part of the movie ends at the hotel breakfast, where Louise, after having said goodbyes to her boyfriend, is described by the waiter as almost as hot as to set the room on fire, receives Thelma who glows with satisfaction having been ""properly f**ked"" for the first time in her life.However, after a peak experience like this, normal life with a passive aggressive beta husband seems such a bleak choice that for Thelma there is no longer turning back. The decision to continue the life of violence is made at this point, when Thelma decides to emulate the exciting bad boy criminal and rob a store. There is no longer any convenient explanation or justification for the deeds of the women. Their circle of violence and depravity escalates with drunk driving, speeding, an attack against a police officer, and finally blowing up a truck the driver of which made unpleasant sexual gestures towards them. The inevitability of their choice and rejection of ordinary life culminates in the final drive to the canyon.If one wishes to see Thelma and Louise as a feminist flick, however, it does not give a very good picture of the qualities of women. Thelma and Louise suffer from a total lack of control in their life decisions. Every problem they face in the film is caused by their own mistakes: Too early and unconsidered marriage, excessive drinking and flirting, lack of emotional control in the shooting, inability to assess the situation and report the rape charge to the police, when all the signs of violence and blood are still visible, leaving a considerable amount of money unguarded in a room with a confessed robber, resorting to criminal activities to get money, phoning the police while knowing that the call is being traced etc. So, rather than looking at the movie as a depiction of female victimhood in the hands of an oppressive society, one might look at the movie as a comprehensive critique of modern womanhood which refuses to accept accountability and responsibility and escapes in a dreamworld, finally rejecting all reality even up to the point of driving to a canyon. However, the problem with this outlook is that the main characters are not very pleasant to follow. Their stupid and irresponsible decisions one after another mainly raise furor in the viewer. The best redeeming quality of the film is the scenery, which is absolutely fantastic, but is is not enough to raise the film to the position of a classic which has been attributed to it. Therefore I'm giving it an IMDb score of 6 out of 10.",Thelma & Louise

From the first fifteen minutes, I knew that Thelma Dickinson and Louise Sawyer were *not* hardcore rebels in any way, shape, or form (much less that ""feminist"" nonsense). They run into the wrong man, don't take it as well as he hoped they would, and from there things get interesting.What I really liked was that these are regular human beings just trying to work through a difficult situation any way they can. They're unhappy with their lives, of course, but that's nothing unusual. They don't put up with crap, but that's not unusual either; in fact, it's downright refreshing. They're under pressure and don't always make the right decision, and sometimes there's no right decision at all, just the least bad one (what they did to the highway cop, for example).It's a remarkable and memorable trip, with only a minimal amount of violence until the showdown at the end. And even though the trip ends very badly for our heroines, it's hard to feel unsatisfied. They made their point and ended the game on their own terms. As close to victory as anyone in their situation could hope for.Could Thelma have aimed more carefully and avoided any need to flee in the first place?

Too often, though, the movie falls back on patriarchal norms to advance its narrative.And, not to spoil the ending too much (if you don't know how this movie ends, get a job and stop living underneath a bridge!), the fate of the women protagonists is, ultimately, the fate of any woman who stands up for herself in a patriarchal society -- total doom.The movie begins on an excellent note. Two women have decided to take a vacation together. The younger of the two, Thelma, does so at the risk of angering her typical knuckle-dragging patriarchal husband who, gag, watches football.The women stop for food and some drinks at a bar and Thelma, enjoying her freedom, gets a little too drunk. A complete sleaze-a-thon takes her to the dance floor and spins her around until she's dizzy and feels the need to vomit. He accompanies her to the parking lot under the guise of helping her, and then, surprise, attempts to rape her.Here's where the movie gets complicated. Louise shoots the rapist before he can go through with the act. Initially, she aims the gun at him and tell him to let her friend go. Of course, the use of the phallis, the gun, is already a flaw in the film. The women should be able to protect themselves without resorting to the oppressive tools of the patriarchy. When the rapist says something rude to Louise, she kills him. Now the women are in trouble.What follows is a Bonnie & Clyde-like adventure across the southwest. While these types of films are enjoyable, they are, essentially, patriarchal fantasies. In one of the movie's more problematic story lines, Thelma goes to bed with a young Brad Pitt just a day or two after she is nearly raped. Any survivor of rape will tell you that's most likely not going to happen, even if it's Brad Pitt!The film builds the relationship between the women but never releases the latent homoerotic nature of their relationship. This is also a flaw.And, as stated, the women are not allowed to get away clean despite the fact that they wished none of the horrible things that happened to them on themselves.Oh, and Harvey Keitel is thrown in to appease all the uncomfortable men who still believe they are somehow not complicit in patriarchal oppression.For entertainment, this is a great movie. For political purposes, it fails tremendously.",Thelma & Louise
201,tangoyank,One of the very best of the 1990s,10,5 July 2000,"This is an absolutely perfect screenplay. I predict that in 50 years or so, this will be viewed as one of the all-time best. As a man, I probably cannot identify personally with the feminist issues the movie raises, but the storyline is amazing from every standpoint. Scott's direction is superb, the performances are flawless, etc. This is a movie that will stand the test of time, and it's hard to believe that the Academy chose ""The Prince of Tides"" over this film as a Best Picture nominee (thank goodness it won for Original Screenplay). The only thing I would change in the entire film is Scott's choice of the happy-moments montage over the closing credits. Although some people may dislike the ending, it's the only possible ending and it's so sobering that the montage distracts from its impact. For a detailed analysis of this film, I'd suggest Syd Field's book ""Four Screenplays."" Like ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"" and ""Bonnie and Clyde,"" this is a true American classic.",Thelma & Louise

203,maxtshea,"Cool movie, horrible hype",7,26 December 2007,"Two strong, smart, and sexy women face incredible odds after a chain of ill-starred events. T&L is bona-fide ""buddy movie"" in which the buddies are female in roles typically reserved for male anti-heroes. They're tough and savvy...and flawed for sure. That's why we root for them. The Southern twang, the convertible, the desert highway, and the law in hot pursuit: Cinema Americana at its best! In 1993 Thelma & Louise was on the syllabus of my women's studies course as required viewing. A neurotic college town rallying cry was: ""Thelma & Louise Live!"" To be sure, there were overtly ""feminist"" themes in the film, such as sexual assault, domestic violence, patriarchy, women breaking free of the ""nice girl"" repression, and women fighting back. However, in the end, it was just a Hollywood road movie and an awfully thin soup for a Power-to-Women manifesto! When it turns up on TV, I still have trouble divorcing the film from the pitiful pop culture legacy from the early '90s.Watch T&L and enjoy it for what it is.

It was through my lectures that I heard of the film Thelma and Louise, and I am so glad that I have seen it! Its a brilliant portrayal of two womens fight with the law, although with the clever use of editing and the greatness of Khouri's script, you will still feel so much sympathy for the characters right up until the closing stages. It's a wonderful film, filled with emotion! It'll make you laugh and cry, and no doubt keep you on the edge of your seats!

205,lashawill,Transgression is freedom,8,18 December 2012,"This is a story of a two women who went for a short trip to get out of an everyday senselessness and ended up in a thrill.At the beginning Thelma is somewhat naive housewife, open and vulnerable like a child. Which is not particularly surprising since she spends most of her life at home and her relationship with her husband (Darryl) is akin more to that of between a growing teenage daughter and father than between a couple. The way she sneaks out of the house, not daring to tell Darryl about her trip, leaving a note instead and the way Darryl reacts when he learns about adventures of Thelma are good illustrations of the nature of their relationship.Although most of the movie, Thelma and Louise are running from immanent danger, they are more free then ever in their lives.At the end of the movie Thelma and Louise, both confess that they feel like having awoken. What have they awoken from? Maybe they have awoken from a dream which they did not even knew was a dream and now that they have awoken, they not only understand that it was only a dream but a nightmare too. It was a dream of structured lives, of everyday routine, of boundaries and limits, of life's purpose, of American dream...",Thelma & Louise

The women, the last scene, Brad Pitt's sex scene, even the car are film and cultural legends. Few movies create iconic characters that become part of our lexicon but, when people say someone is a ""Thelma"" or a ""Louise"" or they are a ""Thelma and Louise"" you know exactly what they mean. The last scene is iconic cinema if there ever was. You definitely don't want to pull a ""Thelma and Louise"" in your car! Brad Pitt exploded onto the scene in this film and he has been a sex symbol ever since. I re-watched Thelma and Louise nearly twenty years after its release and it was as poignant and funny as it ever was. If you have never seen this movie then by all means help yourself to a chunk of American culture and if you haven't seen it for a while then watch again, it has aged pretty darn well.

207,RHPSFan,Shows 'Girl Power' better than the Spice Girls did.,10,25 March 1999,"'Thelma & Louise' really shows 'girl power', much better than the Spice Girls did. This intense drama shows that a woman can be just as good of a runaway than a man. Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon are so dominant in this movie, it is very dramatic. They played the perfect Thelma and Louise, no other actress could portray them the way they did. The end- whether you think it ended badly or beautifully, it still causes tears. It is very powerful, and after it you will think ""Wow,"" because of this movie's passion and force. At times you'll laugh, at times you'll cry, but in the end you will be glad you watched it. Academy Award for best Picture is what it received, and it deserved it wholeheartedly. This movie is a great combination, and is the perfect road movie.

As far as dynamic duos, the chemistry between Geena and Susan is palpable on-screen. They're iconic women, beyond reproach, and this movie is a beautiful act of revenge for every woman (or person who grew up subject to misogyny). Time and time again, we see these women stand up for themselves and take matters into their own hands. I wholly recommend seeing this timeless classic - see it as soon as possible, if you know what's good for you!",Thelma & Louise
210,TootlesT,fun and enjoyable,9,23 March 2005,"Scott's Thelma and Louise is an entertaining and amusing film regarding the growing friendship of its female leads. Thelma and Louise start off going on an innocent voyage and end up as fugitives. Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon are brilliant. The chemistry between these two women is intense and very impressive. They constantly feed off each other's actions and emotions, which is what makes Thelma and Louise so comfortable to watch. Thelma and Louise are depicted as strong and independent women, consequently making all men in the movie seem powerless. These two best friends always dominated the film's men (whether it was killing them or deceiving them), and ultimately escaped them and life altogether. I wouldn't say that Scott's enjoyable film makes the viewer truly feel for his characters, but it makes the viewer contemplate the innocence of Thelma and Louise. Are they really criminals, or are they just helpless victims? In addition, the film's ending is extremely powerful. These women were determined to be free, and the only way they could do so was to die together.Everything in this film fits together. The acting, cinematography, and directing is superb. The feminist message is evident, but not advocated too passionately. The soundtrack is also excellent. It adds to the whole ""go-with-the-flow"" feel of the film. Although Thelma and Louise is a particularly long film, it never gets boring. It is a fun and well-written story about the sincere bond between two domineering women.",Thelma & Louise

212,BigE-3,Learn to Fly,10,30 August 2000,"I think just about everything could be said about this movie has already been said, so I just want to make a few small points.First, I love this movie.  There are few movie as exhilarating as this one -- pure emotional exhilaration without the whole ""good beats evil"" garb. Second, this movie is unabashedly feminist -- good for you!  ""Feminism"" has been smeared into such a dirty word today (especially in the US), it's such a relief to see such a proud feminist film.  I'm a man, so I can't say I understand everything.  But one thing I do understand: there's nothing dirty about being a feminist, just like Thelma and Louise have discovered (it certainly does NOT mean man-bashing, as Keitel and Madsen's characters can attest; Pitt's character is -- interesting -- at least certainly not negative).  Third: anyone remember one of the last car chase scenes, as the two women's car rushes unflinchingly forward, more than a dozen police cars follow them, raising a cloud of sand in the desert?  It just seem so fantastic to me -- so unbelievable, yet so gripping.  It, for some reason, reminds me one of F.S. Fitzgerald's passage in ""The Great Gatsby"" -- I don't remember the exact words, something like ""the unreality of reality?""  A fantasy fused so closely and convincingly with reality, its name could only be hope -- no, determination.",Thelma & Louise
213,reversal68,How easy it is to become a criminal,8,1 January 2001,"My impression of this movie is not one of feminist propaganda.  Rather, this movie demonstrates the ease by which an individual, male or female, may become a criminal.  The greatness of this movie lies in its strong writing, plot, and superb acting.  While this movie could be classified by some as a typical ""fugitives-running-from-the-law"" formula, it has enough depth of characters and great dialogue to set it apart from other movies of its genre.Furthermore, Scott does not sugar-coat Louise's criminal act. If Louise had shot a man while he was raping Thelma, that would be the typical melodramatic drivel, suitable for the Lifetime Network.  Such a script would likely climax with a courtroom scene in which Louise would be exonerated, with the assistance of a silver-haired compassionate defense attorney. Instead, Scott gives us a Louise who shoots a man: a man who has retreated from his attempt to commit a rape upon her friend.  The man has backed away after seeing the gun-wielding Louise.  However, when he utters offensive language, she shoots. Of course, she realizes she has no legal defense to her murder of the man, and thus, she must flee.The greatest part of this movie is the transformation of the character, Thelma.  At first, Thelma, the weaker character, feels compelled to flee with Louise, though Thelma herself has committed no criminal act.  Of course, she goes along with Louise, perhaps because of her own guilt and feeling of responsibility for having placed Louise in this predicament. After all, Thelma perhaps feels that she created the circumstances under which Louise felt compelled to shoot the man, due to Thelma's placing her safety in jeopardy through her drunken waltz to the alley with the bar pick-up.  Perhaps, Thelma feels compelled to go with Louise, because, after all, Louise saved her from the hands of the would-be rapist, or perhaps, Thelma feels compelled to go with her simply because she has nowhere else to go.  One gets the impression that Thelma lacks legal knowledge sufficient to realize that she is not complicit in the murder of the man.  In any event, Thelma follows along with Louise, and through their fugitive journey, she becomes a stronger, more independent person.  Davis does a wonderful job of portraying the transformation of this shrinking violet, into a bold, gun-toting criminal.This movie also demonstrates that an initial criminal act, will most likely result in subsequent criminal acts for the individual.  For Louise, the criminal acts that follow in the wake of the murder, are ones of necessity--the criminal acts are a result of Louise's feeling that her life is spinning out of control.  The criminal acts are miniscule in comparison to the homicide she has committed.  As she has committed the most serious of crimes, what are a few robberies in comparison?  However, for Thelma, the subsequent criminal acts are ones of personal empowerment---the criminal acts are a result of Louise's feeling that she is finally taking control of her own life.  Thus, Scott masterfully gives us the comparative workings of the criminal mind in two individuals--one who is relinquishing control of her own life through her criminal acts, and another who is finally gaining control of her own life through her criminal acts.Finally, for those men who posted on this board who seem to find this movie unsettling, I suspect that you identify with one of the male characters in the movie, rather than Thelma or Louise.  Your negative comments about this movie are telling.  Perhaps, you should watch it again and discover which male character with whom you identify.  You may learn a lot about yourself.
I am a woman and my favorite movies are The Good the Bad and the Ugly and Patton. I identify with Blondie and Patton, despite our gender differences. The GTBTU and Patton contain no major women characters.  A woman is beaten by Lee Van Cleef in one scene in the GTBTU, but no other women come to mind in that movie.  As for Patton, there is a single scene with the General being surrounded by a bunch of old English biddies.In closing, I would suggest for any men or women who enjoy a good tale and fine acting, Thelma and Louise is a must-see.",Thelma & Louise

216,alh15,I liked it!,9,24 March 2005,"I really enjoyed this film. From it's crazy unexpected plot to the dynamic relationship between the two friends. I enjoyed watching the two interact and how Geena Davis' Thema broke out of her shell and dramatically changed from the beginning to the end. From a submissive wife to a smoking, drinking wild woman. I also enjoyed Susan Sarandon's Louise and how she mothered Thelma and how in the end their roles had become equal if not switched. The explicit scenes were well done in that they showed just enough to get a rise out of audience but not to offend them. As an audience member I felt that the end of the first explicit scene was just the way it should've been and that I would have taken the same action as Louise. I also enjoyed the scenes with Brad Pitt. Who wouldn't?",Thelma & Louise
217,dmconnor,Still crazy after all these years,10,14 September 1999,"I'd guess I've probably seen ""Thelma & Louise"" 30-40 times since 1991, and it remains my all-time fave.  Although I see a good number of movies, I tend not to relate all that well to female actors, and this was the first time Susan Sarandon ever really grabbed me.  She is luminous in this film, and I haven't missed a movie of hers since (although there were one or two I wish I had).The material is just as fresh and edgy now as it was 8 years ago when I first saw it.  The camera work in the New Mexico/Arizona lanscape as night fades into morning is stupendous, as it is at the Arkansas bar where the adventure begins.  My dismay at the aftermath of Brad Pitt's visit to Thelma is as palpable now as ever it was, and my heart sails with these incredible women each time I see them launch their new lives at the end of the movie.Much is made of whether the end of this movie is depressing or exhilarating. I vote wholeheartedly for ""exhilarating"":  I don't know if I'd have the cojones to do it or not, but Thelma and Louise bring their impossible situation to a satisfying close on their terms, and they do it with gusto. I feel certain that the tears I shed every time I see this movie are joy, not sadness.Kallie Khouri richly deserved her Oscar for screenwriting, and I've always felt that both Sarandon and Davis were robbed.  Jodi Foster, you may remember, won best actress in 1991, for her portrayal of Clarice Starling in ""Silence of the Lambs.""  There have been Oscars that Foster deserved, but Clarice was not her best role, and it certainly wasn't the best role played by a woman that year.I think, too, that this movie, aside from being the greatest buddy movie ever made, is a great feminist manifesto.  The male characters, with the exception Hal Slocumb and Jimmy, are total buffoons, and I've known a thousand men like them.  This is a story of two women who fight back against the oppression of idiot losers, and live their lives honestly, justly, and on their own terms.",Thelma & Louise
218,Grumpyoldman,Road movie with a twist,7,20 May 2006,"Thelma & Louise is a celebration of life. Ridley Scott makes a very different film once again and seems to refuse to be pigeon-holed. There is much comment about this being a ""male bashing"" film. I would say ignore it: I have found this movie to provide great entertainment each time I have watched it. The protagonists are likable and, as with every good anti-hero, we start wanting them to get away with it. Road movies usually appeal to me but they can be variable in quality. Thelma & Louise is one which holds you from start to finish. The storyline is far fetched at times but I doubt that the film was intended to be super realistic, rather to provide an engaging thrill ride. They got the job done without question.",Thelma & Louise

The change in Thelma as she goes from bullied housewife to sexually awakened, independent woman is beautifully rendered.

It's a thrilling tale full of life affirming energy and the two leads each deserved twenty Oscars each! My favourite film ... and I'm male!

222,ahab19,A hell of a ride,10,23 February 2012,"One of the most clichéd sayings when it comes to describing a film is that ""they broke all of the rules"". However, if there was ever a movie that this term applied to, Thelma and Louise is the one.This masterfully written, directed and acted extraordinary film starts out very ordinarily. Louise is an ordinary blue collar woman with a sharp tongue, Thelma is an ordinary bored housewife. The two women set out for a weekend to escape their ordinary boring lives. And then something happens.The girls stop for a drink at a local bar. Thelma, clearly enjoying the temporary liberation from her housewife prison indulges in the fun that she craves- drinking, dancing and flirting with men. Unfortunately for her she naively encounters the wrong patron who takes her out back and proceeds to brutally rape her. She is saved by Louise who brandishes a gun and tells the man to let Thelma go. Out of harms way the girls begin to leave and then man taunts them. Enraged, Louise shoots the man, killing him instantly.Prior to this incident these two ordinary women followed the rules, which resulted in very little happiness in their lives. Neither had much money. There are no characters who give these women the love that they need. No parents, children or other family members are mentioned. Louise's boyfriend who we meet later does seem to care about her but is incapable of showing it. Thelma's husband is shown as nothing less than complete buffoon to a cartoonish degree.This is a film that does not come out and tell the audience certain important details but it makes them very obvious, again, thanks to Ridley Scott's directing and the performances of the two leads. We know that Louise motivations are a resulted of a traumatic incident from her past. We are never told what it was or when it was, that is up to the imagination of the viewer. We do know that it was traumatic enough to haunt Louise on a deep and personal level.After the incident at the bar the real journey begins, both for the two lead characters and for the audience. The ultimate morality rule of films- when rules are broken, consequences are to be paid. In this film we as the audience understand why these two women were broken, we were there and we sympathize, even cheer them on. After all, who among us has not broken the rules? But fairness does not make anyone above the law, especially not ordinary people and not these women. Thelma and Louise may have started out as ordinary but they have now become outlaws and it is now only a matter of time before the law cataches up with them. The women decide on running away to Mexico and the story becomes about the encounters obstacles they face in reaching their destination. There are many moments of unpredictability, particularly when the characters backs are against the wall. These two once ""ordinary"" characters do what they have to do, including robbing stores for money and locking a policeman in the trunk of a car. Always breaking the rules, but always justified.Yet there are also notable moments of fun, particularly when the women pick up a young drifter played by Brad Pitt. Pitt's performance and screen presence left a tremendous impact on the audience and launched him into super stardom.One unpredictable character in particular comes in the form of Harvey Kietel as the sympathetic chief of police. His character is the most conflicted. His job is to bring in these women who broke the law. But at the same time he sees the reasoning behind the women that the audience sees.Of course, this film is also infamous for its ending. After spending two hours rooting for these two characters, the law catches up with them and we as the audience know that they will not escape to Mexico. We have witnessed their transformation throughout the film and by the end we understand their unwillingness to go back to the lives that they had. And yet it is still a shock when (SPOILER ALERT) they decide to drive their car into the canyon, taking their own lives.The ending is ambiguous, do we cheer for these women because they made their decision? We've all heard the slogan, ""Live free or die"" but we rarely see people make that choice.Its an ending that may not be satisfying but it is certainly interesting.",Thelma & Louise
223,Lonesomewolf,Absolutely wonderful and extraordinarily breathtaking!!!,10,17 July 2005,"Thelma & Louise is such a great movie with an enjoyable storyline and it truly is one of the best films I've ever seen. Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis were perfect for their roles and they both gave the film a fantastic performance. The excitement begins after the two of them go to a club to have a few drinks one night and when some guy befriends Thelma and asks her to dance, they begin dancing along with other patrons to country music while Louise goes to the bathroom. Thelma steps outside of the bar with the guy who asked her to dance and he sets her up onto the back of his car and tries to rape her after she refuses to kiss him. Louise appears behind the attempted rapist with a gun pointed at his head and demands him to let Thelma go. He takes his hands off of Thelma as she walks away and Louise begins walking in the same direction as her. At that moment, the guy makes a sexually crude remark to Louise which provocatively insults her and she shoots him dead with her hand-held gun. After that, the two of them leave the scene of the crime in Louise's 1966 Thunderbird while being followed by the cops. Thelma and Louise is thrilling and exciting all the way through and has such an intense yet tragic conclusion. One of the most amazing things about the story is the fact that Thelma and Louise have such an unbeatable friendship and they will stop at nothing to fight for their freedom.",Thelma & Louise
224,smh19,Thelma and Louise,9,24 March 2005,"Thelma and Louise innocently begins with two best friends and their plan to spend the weekend together. This drastically changes as the twosome become wanted criminals. A major concern of this movie is challenging gender roles. When the girls are first at the bar, the waitress is sure they were not associated with the murder because she says those two nice women were not the murdering type. This is implying that murdering is only a men's job. The treatment of Thelma from her husband Darrel exemplifies the existing role of the woman in the household. She is believed to only cook and work for her husband. Thelma's actions crush this stereotype as she becomes an independent woman and even commits a burglary. Most of the men in the movie are poorly portrayed. There is the obscene truck driver, the rapist, the neglecting Darrel and the pathetic cop. This movie successfully challenges the existing gender roles in society and closes the gap between men and women.",Thelma & Louise

It touches you, it move you and makes you want to scream and shout, cry and laugh. Ridley Scott is a great director, and it was this film that really made me love him. It's so good. The filming is great, the art direction is appropriate and the soundtrack is amazing. It's a film about happiness, and how we can be kept away from it. And how women are supposed to just shut up and take whatever they are put through. It teaches you to never give up your dreams, live by your own example and take your life in your hands. We can't just sit around watching life pass by. And when you get the chance - take it. And never apologize for being you.See this film, just see it!

I nearly wet myself laughing every time I see it!Interestingly, on the Region 2 DVD version of the film, there is an ""extended ending"" as one of the extras.

The tag line 'Somebody told them to get a life...so they did' is somewhat misleading unless the definition of life is murder and eventual suicide. What is this film trying to prove? That women can also capable leading violent lives? If this is liberation then women should be weary. Had the Geena Davis character left her abusive husband, forged out a new independent life for herself and found happiness, now that would have been inspirational. But alas, all we get is another road movie glamorizing violence. Yawn.",Thelma & Louise

Will watch again!",Thelma & Louise

Amazing music, road adventure, drastic changes of the characters under pressure , these concepts seem to be cliche however with the acting , it has become a unique one time experience. The fact that costume and styling of the characters are changing over the incidents while going wilder , more disorganized was a good nuance.",Thelma & Louise

Lovely Geena Davis and tough Susan Sarandon gave their best performances so far (does anybody really like ""Dead Man walking"" or ""Little Stewart 1 + 2""? Since I saw this movie for the first time, I dream of touring like these girls through the backyard of America. Perhaps without some of the crimes. It's hard to categorize this movie, as its funny but with a strong blue note and offers a lot of surprises for, even when watching it for the 5th time. So many worthwhile details and words are packed in all scenes and dialogues. Not to mention the amazing scenery with some of Americas most beautiful landscapes. I don't like the end to be honest, as it forbids a sequel. But perhaps this perfect story is not to repeat and we just watch the original again. Congratulations, Ridley Scott.

I just love every dialogue, as they are never boring or dull. Brad Pitt and husband Daryll are alone worth watching this movie, but even without them it would be perfect enter- tainment. And I surely think its no pur women-movie. This story is just about poor people in the heart of America without any perspectives and surprises in their life. Thelma and Louise experience what the absolute majority of American middle classe never will, a kind of freedom and self-esteem.

Their travel in the vast dessert symbolizes their search for freedom. The dessert is so vast that women feel free from the rules and their roles as women. Thelma (Geena Davis) is a married woman and a housewife and appears to be fed up with the routine, cooking, cleaning,and serving her husband at home. Louise(Susan Sarandon) is not married but working at a pub, and as a woman has to put up with sexual harassment all the time. Ridley Scott is very successful with the use of symbols in the movie. The city life represents socially established rules (marriage, law etc)and the burden women have due to their sex roles.

Every man in the movie was made out to be an a-hole or a pussy like the cop who cried. The movie wanted to make a statement, but I was more interested in the storyline which was actually pretty good. As far as why they felt it necessary to commit, suicide, I didn't find that move convincing at all, but it was entertaining. Now if you're a guy, and you want to know worst atrocity of this film, it was the ending when they committed suicide. For Christ sake, did you see that car they were driving?? It was a beautiful classic 65 Ford Thunderbird convertible, and those 2 bitches trashed it. They should have parked it and jumped off the cliff.",Thelma & Louise
235,kgq1,Thelma and Louise= great movie!!!!!!,8,24 March 2005,"I recently watched Thelma and Louise. I found this movie to be a very easy to watch and enjoyable film. The two main characters who were played by Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis truly made one watching the film feel as if they are lifetime friends. These two women are traveling across country on a liberating road trip away from the control of men and eventually this innocent trip turns into a run from the police. This movie is a powerful movie about friendship and feminism. It showed how women are becoming more and more like men. This movie in some ways was very similar to another movie I recently watched, Myra Breckenridge. It shows how women are now having more control over their lives and are now controlling men rather have men control them. The movie had a mix of action, drama, and comedy which makes it a great movie for anyone to watch and enjoy it.",Thelma & Louise

What is so wonderful about watching two ordinary women screw up just one time (ok, homicide is a biggie) only to have their lives snowball out of control? Maybe because the way it all happens, one thing leading inexorably to another (picking up a hitchhiker, committing armed robbery, resisting arrest, blowing up a rig, and finally...) makes you wonder: could this kind of thing happen to me and what would I do in their place? The leads are perfect in their roles. The pacing and photography are magnificent. And the dialog! When Thelma tells the cop he better be nice to his wife, because ""my husband wasn't nice to me and look how I turned out"" -- the whole audience cheered. An inventive and consistently entertaining movie that effectively mixes drama, suspense,action and humor. You have to see it once in your life.",Thelma & Louise

Joe Bob Briggs was right: the only thing distinguishing ""Thelma and Louise"" from the crappy flicks that Gilbert Gottfried and Rhonda Shear used to present on USA Up All Night is that the makers and promoters of the latter didn't intend their over-the-top misandry to be taken seriously.This film's heavy-handed political correctness speaks volumes about the zeitgeist of the early 1990s, a time when the mainstream media treated Marxist feminist Catharine A. MacKinnon as an unbiased expert on male sexuality and celebrated the infamous Lorena Bobbit as something of a folk hero worthy of emulation. Students of the 1990s as history will find ""Thelma and Louise"" of interest, but I can't otherwise recommend this film to anyone but the most ardent man-hater. Even the tendentious ""Higher Learning"" was better written and more entertaining.",Thelma & Louise
238,hendrickssavana,Great movie about female friendship.,10,8 April 2019,"What an exhilarating movie! One of the best road movies of all time! Geena Davis and Susan Sarandon are fantastic as Thelma Dickinson and Louise Sawyer! You sympathize with both of them. I can see why first time screenwriter Callie Khouri won the Academy Award for Best Original Screenplay.Thelma and Louise is about two female best friends going on a weekend long fishing trip. Thelma wants to get away from her do rolling husband Darryl and Louise also wants to get away from her on-again, off-again boyfriend, Jimmy, who seems like he won't commit to a long-term relationship or marriage. Once they leave, they stop at a bar to get some refreshments because Thelma wants to get some. While there, Thelma meets a man named Harlan, whom she dances with all night long. Harlan takes Thelma out to the parking lot and tries to rape her. Louise comes to her rescue and puts a gun to Harlan's head. As they walk away, he hurls insults and other obscenities at them, which makes Louise mad, causing her to shoot and kill him. Because Louise thinks the police will not believe it was self-defense, she tells Thelma they should go on the run. From here, they grow desperate and decide to flee to Mexico; as they travel there, things go awry for them as their situation grows more and more dire.This is a movie with both funny and sad scenes. The chemistry between Davis and Sarandon is phenomenal. They both received Best Actress Oscar nominations for their performances. This is a great movie about true female friendship because they always stood up for each other and were always there for each other. They also always stuck together until the very end. There is a lot of feminism propaganda in here, which is easy to see.The attempted rape scene is very intense, so if you are very sensitive to the subject of rape, you probably should not watch this movie since you may not be able to get past that scene.This is absolutely one great classic film, which was inducted into the National Film Registry in 2016. This is truly one of my all-time favorite movies. My favorite scene in the movie is when they get their revenge on truck driver who will not stop making obscene gestures and calling them derogatory things by blowing out the tires on his tanker truck and then blowing it up. That scene makes me laugh every time I watch the movie.The soundtrack is also great! My favorite song on the soundtrack is Glenn Frey's ""Part of Me, Part of You."" It serves as the theme song of the movie, which I think was a smart choice because it talks about how they are a part of each other and how they will always be there for each other, no matter what happens to either one of them.I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who can handle watching this movie!",Thelma & Louise
239,grenfell-muir,very upsetting sexual assault scene,7,25 January 2006,"a decent movie, but it is worth noting that the attempted rape is VERY traumatic to watch, even though the attempt is interrupted. For anyone who is sensitive to watching sexual assaults, this one will be hard to forget or get past in order to concentrate on the rest of the movie. and it is also depressing because the woman who is assaulted ends up dying, which is just rotten... she didn't even shoot the guy. so you feel bad for this poor woman on many levels, and unless you consider death to be a victory, it can leave you feeling pretty beat up.I would recommend fast-forwarding through the assault scene, and not even listening to it at all. it's revolting. but worth watching the rest of it.",Thelma & Louise

It is clever, exciting, and funny and is shot in the middle of the breathtaking scenery of the American Southwest.  However, the thing that makes it special is its illustration of pure friendship.  It may be difficult for some men to cross the gender boundary and connect with Thelma and Louise, yet doing so is critical to appreciating the film.  If you can make the connection then you can get its message -- we all need a friendship like the one Thelma and Louise had.  This movie will strike a deep emotional chord.....if you aren't afraid to let it.  And if you happen to be too emotionally closed off to appreciate what I think the movie says about friendship I think that you will still enjoy the characters, acting, action, and humor.  It is a ten out of ten.",Thelma & Louise
242,beartiger,Guys can learn from what they may not like about this movie.,10,23 July 2000,"First of all, I really love this movie.  It is tightly written, has beautiful cinematography, and is incredibly emotionally involving.  I know that many men dislike this movie, and I don't blame them.  They are placed in the uncomfortable and unfamiliar position of having no role models of their own gender, where every male is the movie is seriously flawed, underdeveloped, stereotyped, and peripheral to the action of the story. Well, guess what?  Welcome to the everyday life of a woman watching almost any Hollywood Movie.  Consider all the movies out there where every woman is either a sexual fantasy, the hero's rewards for his labors, a middle age corporate bitch, the loving giving woman with no personality or life of her own, a prostitute, etc etc.  Women in most movies are serously flawed, underdeveloped, stereotyped, and peripheral to the action of the story. Take the recent horror movie What Lies Beneath (which is excellent, by the way).  When was the last time Hollywood made the concerns and fears of a fortysomething woman the central driving force of a story?  Do you think Hollywood matches nineteen-year-old actresses with sixty year old male stars because that is what women want to see?  I know that the only way that men can enjoy Thelma and Louise is by trying to identify with the female characters (which can be done, but requires an effort).  Women would also like to see movies where we don't have to be able to identify solely with the male characters in order to enjoy it.  Many men are also disturbed (and rightly so...it was supposed to be disturbing) by the way Louise chose to solve her problem with Thelma's rapist, but were they disturbed by the scene in Total Recall where Arnold Schwartzneggar shoots Sharon Stone point blank and tells her, ""Consider this a divorce""?  I didn't hear all the public outcry over that mean spirited bit of misogyny.  Men are just not used to being treated in movies the way women are treated on a daily basis.",Thelma & Louise

Then there is Louise who blasts Harlan away and goes on the lam with Thelma. But something happened to Louise a long time ago that she won't tell Thelma. A warning to all other men out there. Take note of what you see and learn from it. Learn how women wish to be treated and see how abusive and sick some men are. Watching 'Thelma and Louise' has had a huge impact on me and has given me a great and important lesson in life. Plus it has a terrific cast including Geena Davis, Susan Sarandon, Michael Madsen and Brad Pitt in his movie debut.

I cried and I felt an inside happiness, like I haven't felt once in any movie before.This road trip was also a road trip into my own soul. Carried by those 2 great actresses I was able to slip any restraints of so-called manhood.

Just with passion and emphatic understanding, Keitel understands from the very first moment, to get all men into this story and to follow the dream of 2 women until their very end.So yes!

249,s3019653,Is it anti-male?,9,3 May 2004,"A lot of people have dubbed this as a ""chick flick"" but I do not really like that term as it implies that men cannot enjoy watching it. Alien had a female lead and had parts that were sad but nobody would call that a chick flick. Also is every movie about male characters a guy flick? I thought this was a great drama and the acting was superb. No one can deny that this movie is a classic and has influenced the English language. I would also like to mention that I am a man. In response to people who bash the movie saying that it is anti-male; I would like to say that Thelma and Louise is simply a movie about situations that happen to women all too often. Women are raped everyday and women are abused everyday; this movie brings that into the light and says that it is not good enough. I do not believe that shooting the rapist was justified but at least he did not get away with it. The movie shows that by running away from your problems things only get worse. People have also commented that there are no men that are not portrayed negatively. Both the sympathetic police officer and Jimmy are likable characters. The purpose of this film was not to celebrate masculinity but to show two women breaking free from oppression. Not all women are raped or abused but it is something that is very common and it is relevant enough to be a theme of a movie.I was very moved by the movie and I gave it a 9/10",Thelma & Louise

This is a heart warming story, and it's written and performed in a way that really makes the audience fall in love with the 2 main characters, and feel what they feel as they go through the movie. Watch this movie if you want to laugh, cry, sympathise, scream at the screen, and really get involved in a movie. It really does leave you wanting more at the end of the film, which is a little frustrating, but amidst the tears and the smiles it doesn't really matter. I love it. I love it. I LOVE IT!

It has all the ""big blockbuster"" elements of explosions, shootings and car chases. The plot is simple and intends to portray the fugitives as victims. Thelma and Louise did not leave their homes with the intention of becoming outlaws however after a man attempts to rape Thelma, Louise shoots him. Though rape is a heinous crime, I just couldn't sympathize with their situation and felt that the murder was unjustified. Overall, there was nothing revolutionary in this film. The themes of bored housewives, international fugitives, female companionship and living life to the fullest are nothing new. On a positive note, the acting performances were rather good and convincing. Davis and Sarandon displayed female companionship to the fullest and Brad Pitt's performance was also enjoyable.",Thelma & Louise
253,leapinglizardland,"Like poetry in motion, this is one awesome flick",9,18 January 2017,"One of the ultimate, ""good girls gone bad by circumstance,"" films in cinematic history, Thelma & Louise, was a ground-breaking movie showcasing the story of two women who embarked on a crime spree, not out of want, but of the pure necessity for survival. In 1991, it was relatively rare to see females in a position of pure power and wielding weapons (that includes both sex AND guns). Finally, a big box office film showed that when pushed headlong into moral, ethical and life or death situations, women can be just as ruthless, strong and resourceful as men. These chicks didn't need to be rescued, coddled or defended. It is a, ""stand your ground"" movie that really hit viewers, especially females, in the gut. Today, we have a surplus of woman-empowered films, but 25 years ago they were far more rare. Sure, I finally saw this flick at the dollar theater years after it's initial release, but it was no less spectacular. At certain moments, even I, as a somewhat cynical and strong chick myself, got goosebumps in reaction to some scenes, like the one near the end of the film where the two feisty felines finally emasculate the disgusting, slovenly and perverted truck driver that plagued the two for most of the movie and then proceed to blow his rig to the moon (although gas tanks don't explode just because a well- placed bullet hits them; it's actually the fumes from the gas that ignite, not the liquid itself). Just awesome. And to add insult to injury, Thelma steals the trucker's filthy hat as he screams in defeat, ""you bit**es from hell!"". Hilarious and well deserved payback. Thelma & Louise is a brilliantly acted, wonderfully written and fabulously directed movie that is officially in my personal, ""Top ten chick flicks of all time"" list. Except...the soundtrack tries to suck the life out of almost every scene with a soundtrack. Good grief, those tunes really stink. It's not that I hate country music, it's that the creators of this film somehow managed to find the absolute worst songs in music history. Horrid. Sometimes I hit the mute button to spare my sensitive ears; I prefer trash metal/hard rock. Regardless, I think every female over the age of 17 should see this movie at least once in their lives. Hopefully, one day they will show it to their granddaughters.",Thelma & Louise
254,carlossanchez1999,¡¡¡¡simply the best movie ever!!!!!,10,18 December 2006,"OK first of all, i'm a guy (a straight guy) and i have to confess that ""Thelma and Louise"" it's my favorite movie of all time. Sure is a chick flick but even guys can enjoy it, what i love about this movie is the fact that most people see it as a feminist movie but it's so does not. The movie deals with the reality that most of the women are force to live now a days, first there's Thelma the typical housewives who's life goes around a probably unfaithful husband and all the ""to do's2 of her house and does not do anything to risky cause ""it might2 get her husband upset. Second there's Louise a 40 something woman who has a though past and leads her to become the strong (sometimes bitter)woman that she is now. And then there's the guys in the movie. I personally think that the grates are the 3 leading man interpreted gracefully by Harvey keithel (hal) Michael masden (jimmy) and christopher mcdonald (darryl) all of them give us a look of what it is the man perception from women's perspective (hal is the guy that seems to be perfect,compressive and brave but in the long run he is a guy and that is show when he talks about the (women shits) with darryl. Jimmy is the typical romantic guy that gives everything for his girl but that's all because he ""loves the chase"" and then there's darryl who happens to be the typical ""macho man"" that thinks that women are only on earth to serve their husbands) But anyway the movie in my opinion is just great, great scrip, great performances, great scenarios, and great directing. My favorite part of the movie is that cliffhanging ending that will remain as a cliffhanger perhaps forever. So if you really want to see this movie, ¡do it! you will not me regret and i will stay in your heart for the rest of your life. my vote is an outstanding 10 for an outstanding movie",Thelma & Louise

257,Angie-56,"Not JUST a female buddy movie. It does kick butt, but it's also very intelligent.",10,1 October 1999,"The first few times I saw this movie, I loved it because it was two women kicking butt.  The last couple times I've seen it, I've found it more thought-provoking.  Not all the men are straight-up jerks like Thelma's husband or the guy at the bar.  Some even try to help the ""girls"" out or do what they think they want.  Each male character in the movie somehow misinterprets women in general and specifically Thelma and Louise.  Jimmy (Michael Madsen in an exceptionally hot spell) proposes to Louise, thinking she's going away because he won't commit.  Hal (Harvey Keitel) wants to help them, but treats them like little girls that he has to protect.  These two characters are the most respectful of any men in the movie, yet even they don't quite get it.  The 2nd most disrepectful man, Mr. Thelma, shows real sadness in the midst of his wife's crime spree.  Whether it is recognition of his absolute failure as a husband, or just an idiot's confusion, is not revealed.  The most disrepectful man, the unfortunate Harlan (guy in bar/parking lot), doesn't get a chance to realize the error of his ways, but we can assume that he wouldn't have anyway. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a man-hater.  I love the movie becuase it's presentation of women in society is so multifaceted.  It doesn't present all men as pigs.  Yes, many and mostly, but not all. The performances are fantastic.  Of course, Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis are at their best.  Their (un)supporting cast is also great.  For Harvey Keitel, Hal is a bit flat, but effective.  Brad Pitt found his break here; billed 7th or something, his JD is 15-minute show stealer.  Michael Madsen is superb.  Sure, all his has do is squint and talk in a gravelly voice, but who better to do it, really?  And he does it so well.  Finally, a particular kudos to Christopher MacDonald.  As Darryl Dickenson, he is truly repugnant. It takes a certain courage for an actor to create a character with absolutely no redeeming qualities. Couple more thing: it's an absolutely beautiful picture.  The dust, the sunsets, the T-bird, the increasingly grubby actresses.  The score is great too, and Ridley Scott did just a wonderful job with this one.  Oh, and the soundtrack is great. As I've said, I love the theme side of this film, but I do still watch this movie when I'm having boy-troubles.  The simple pleasure of watching Thelma and Louise blow up trucks and lock state troopers in their trucks is the best medicine.",Thelma & Louise
258,illo66,A road movie?,9,26 May 2000,"I've seen this movie five times. The first time it just looks like a strange road movie, but from the second time on I understand how deep it is.Thelma & Louise are living mediocre lives until they decide to go out for a weekend. In three days their lives will dramatically change...What I find in this movie is strong female characters with fine acting performances, a good soundtrack, wonderful scenery and good action scenes, all in a simple but very effective story talking of true friendship, freedom and female power. A particular mention deserves to Geena Davis playing the transformation of Thelma from a repressed silly housewife to a self-conscious independent woman (maybe you can find something similar in her character(s) in ""The Long Kiss Goodnight""). What really bothers me are all the male characters. With the only exceptions of Jimmy and Hal Slocumb all the men seem to be jerk and the real cause of all the girls' troubles. I'm a man, and I know all the men are not as idiots as shown on this film.In conclusion, one of the most touching and intriguing movies I've ever seen.9/10.",Thelma & Louise
259,kristiezurvas,Empowering yet tragically sad,10,9 June 2020,I feel sad that this movie received claims of being anti male. The reality is that there are a lot of challenges women face just for being female and this movie shows that. The shock factor that this movie portrays is that Thelma and Louise feel that they must take drastic measures to empower and free themselves from the challenges they face as women. It was an incredible movie and definitely a must see.,Thelma & Louise
260,joan-alos,Who is afraid of Thelma & Louise?,7,12 June 2016,"When last Friday my girlfriend suggested watching ""Thelma & Louise"" together, I started sweating. I had been avoiding this film for a long time, mostly because of the feminist brouhaha that surrounds it. Yes, I had taken for granted that the film was a feminist manifesto, that it was about women empowerment and all the sort - just google ""Thelma & Louise"" and discover by yourself what I'm intending to say.But the fact is that ""Thelma & Louise"" is almost everything, but definitely NOT a feminist film. The main characters are two dumb persons who are not able to make sensible decisions. With a little effort the screenplay could be turned into a comedy, as the trailer suggested it was, but then the main characters should be men. The audience would not laugh at two stupid women doing stupid things and acting with rage and violence. Women are supposed to be smart and sensible; men are stupid, rough and impulsive.Under my opinion, ""Thelma & Louise"" stands for ""equality"", in a broad and authentic sense. Never ever before this film was made, two women were depicted as dumb bastards, as men often are. Of course, there had been silly housewives in the movies, and mischievous heroines too. But for the very first time two women could be treated just as two cheap cowboys or two disgraced delinquents.What went wrong, then? How is it that two dumb housewives became two champions for a whole generation of feminists? Let's go a little further.Once stated that Thelma and Louise wouldn't be Tom and Lou, there was only one possibility left: the two women were entitled to be victims. So, almost by definition, all the male characters became villains. Here is where the feminist brouhaha started. And it all grew like a huge snowball.Somehow, the screenplay had the chance of being chosen by a great director as Ridley Scott (by the way, the Coens or Tarantino would be my best choice for a remake). Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis are simply magnificent in their characters. The film, beautifully shot, became a great success. And yes, the author of the screenplay got her Oscar. Her career seems to end here. Have you ever heard about (let me google it again) Callie Khouri? Nor did I, until I was interested in this film. Since then, she has written a lot... about ""Thelma & Louise"", her great (and unique) success. It seems that Ms. Khouri has had time enough to think and re- think about her screenplay and about the reactions surrounding it. The feminist message (intended or not) seemed to work, at least on the surface. Let's feed the beast!SPOILERS AHEAD!Two friends, Thelma and Louise, set out in a convertible for a short vacation. Thelma is married to a man who treats her like a child. Thorough the film we shall discover that Thelma behaves indeed like a child and is unable to take care of herself in the way an adult would. For instance, she takes his husband's gun despite she doesn't know how to use it, so she lends it to Louise, believing that she will protect them both. Louise is older and works as a waitress. We are induced to think that she is the smart one, but eventually we'll discover that she is as dumb as the other woman.When they stop for a drink in a roadhouse, Thelma dances with a guy they've just met. They both get drunk and go out to the parking lot. Thelma seems not to be aware that he intends to have sex with her. When she refuses, he slaps her and attempts to rape her. Fortunately, Thelma appears with her gun and scares him. The drunk man stops, but as the two women go away he insults them. Unfortunately now, Louise loses her temper and shots him to death. Twice. The murderer decides to fly away from the police and Thelma follows her. Eventually we discover that she finds it exciting and behaves childish in order to improve the ""adventure"". When Louise lies to her boyfriend and manages to convince him to risk his life to help her (he is a convict under parole and shouldn't be caught helping an outlaw), Thelma leaves a stranger alone with Louise's life savings in her motel room. Even when the man steals the money Thelma doesn't realize she's done wrong. Instead of leaving Thelma (the cause of all her trouble), Louise lets her ""take care of the situation"", which means robbing a convenience store in the first place. It seems Thelma takes her chance to become a criminal, too.They continue acting in the most stupid way. Instead of surrendering to the police while they are not still charged with murder, they keep flying away in the very same car. Though they intend to go to Mexico, incredibly they avoid Texas (we learn that something bad happened to Louise somewhere in Texas, but it would be advisable to avoid just the town when it happened, not the whole State). They keep overreacting with violence; instead of throwing the accusing gun away, they keep using it. They lock a policeman in a car trunk in the middle of the desert and make a truck explode just because the driver insulted them (twice; the first time as they casually passed him, the second time when they sought for it). Well, it's not the best way to hide from the police.In the end, rather than be captured by the police and face their responsibilities, they decide to drive off the Grand Canyon. We assume that they intend to commit suicide, but as it is Thelma who suggests to ""keep going"", perhaps she believes that the car can fly. Unfortunately the film ends here and we'll never know if the two women managed to escape. Finis.",Thelma & Louise

262,xantraxanadu,Friendship,10,25 June 2010,"I don't really see it as a feminist film, but rather an empowerment of the human spirit. the world is coming down around them and is it because they are women that they go on the lam? no it's because they are friends who support each other. this is a film about friendship not about the ERA. If it were two men, they wouldn't say anything, it would simply be called a buddy-drama. A good story that you can watch over and over along with a great but too brief Brad Pitt cameo, Thelma and Louise delivers on many different levels. It doesn't talk down to its audience or preach to them. And what about the ending? Amazing! I'm surprised the studios let them even shoot it, let alone put it in the final film. Thelma and Louise is one of those rare gems that will span the test of time and remind us what truly good films and truly great friendships can accomplish.",Thelma & Louise

WILD road-movie about two seemingly ordinary women who set out to add a dash of spice to their humdrum monotonous lives and how destiny MORE than indulges them in their mission. One adventure leads to another in this feel-good entertainer and you just keep yearning for more even as the movie ends.

264,zoezoeblue,wow,9,20 November 2011,"Thelma and Louise blew my mind the first time i saw it and no matter what it is still definitely one of my favourites. One thing that you really have to give credit to is the acting, Davis gave an outstanding performance as the victim of a rape and Susan Sarondan was also very good as her best friend.The movie is basically about two very beautiful middle aged women who are the victims of an unfortunate accident and have to runaway as two former outlaws. I really liked this movie because it really centres in how a woman can be very underrated and not be taken serious and in this case raped. The movie really tells you how your life can change completely in just one minute.The end of the movie was very intense but when Thelma and Louise road off the cliff it really got my heart pounding, at that moment i knew that this movie is definitely going to be known as a cinematic classic and Davis and Sarondon's performances will be counted as one of the best.",Thelma & Louise
265,verabgr,Point proved!,9,10 March 2013,"All the hate that I came across reading the boards and the reviews absolutely justifies the reason of existence this movie. This movie might be a feminist movie but in no way it is sexist against men. Not all male characters are portrayed badly except for the rapist, the husband and the truck driver and I have totally seen these guys around! Louise's boyfriend and the police officer are descent character's and Brand Pitt's character is definitely charming and at least he has manners. And to all those saying that if the leads were male the movie would be sexist I only will ask them one question, are males being raped and abused every day? Cause women are and this is the whole point of this movie. How neglected women are in our society and how this is driving them to a dead end! And If you really can't see the sexism against women in our society then you must be blind. Just read the hate comments across the boards and the reviews and you will be enlightened. Women must always look good and be ready to pleasure men, they must always obey and If they want to have fun they are w****s and they must be punished for that or at least that's what many seem to believe! Do women go to the boards of every stupid sexist movie that comes out and moan about it being misogynistic? No, it's only males that passionately throw hatred at every single feminist thing. When any woman stands up to sexist behaviour from men, wants to be independent and doesn't center her life around pleasing men she is immediately called a man hater, feminazi, lesbian and many more. I'm so sick of this! Good news is that the majority recognizes this film but there is still a lot of work to be done for misogyny to be extinct. And nobody said that their actions are right, they are just trapped in this situation and you can see their despair and lack of options and trust me this is how many women feel in real life and that's why this film is such a genius!",Thelma & Louise
266,arda-bilgihan,Outstanding!,9,14 January 2021,"The film that is about the story of two friends living in the 80s begins with Louise offering a weekend getaway to Thelma. Our main characters Thelma and Louise are completely different from each other, Thelma is a character who is forced into a monotonous life by her husband and does not seem to be very happy with her life. Louise is a much more brave and free-spirited character, making her point out to anyone that she doesn't need anyone. In the patriarchal society, our main characters who feel like caged birds, begin their journey and begin to enjoy their freedom. With the rape attemption to Thelma and Louise's commit of murder, the events get worse and our characters suddenly find themselves running away from the police in addition to the patriarchal society. They suffer endless harassment by a truck driver and a hitchiker stoles all the money they have. Thelma and Louise, who understand that they cannot escape from the situation, realize that they do not want to return to the male hegemony. Rather than being caught by the cops, they prefer to drive the car down a cliff.
I found it admirable and impressive that the characters didn't want to go back to their old lives when they saw what it was like to be completely free. It is obvious that what the society imposes on women is a very difficult obstacle for some people to overcome. For the year of 1991, it has been beautifully explained how this patriarchal society enforces women and forced them to do somethings. Besides, I like the cinematograpy and the use of the places during the movie. With the change of characters, the places become more distant from town and barren. I think this is an indication of being away from the perceptions of society.
I also think that side characters have a positive effect on the fluency of the film. The police officer Hal follows Thelma and Louise's next action supportively. I feel that this action shows that some men may be against the patriarchal system. Also I think Thelma's husband Darryl feels regret when he realizes that his wife does not intends to come back and he learnes his lesson after all.
As a conclusion, Thelma & Louise is the movie that wants to tell an idea to the audience in an impressive and such pleasant way. A film that runs out with pleasure and give rise to thought about some things at the end. A film that i loved it much.",Thelma & Louise

I read a few reviews before watching this and decided to give it a chance anyway even with quite a few bad reviews.

268,danjakubik-837-306271,"A powerful, memorable and engaging story about female friendship and liberation",9,21 June 2016,"One of my favorite 90's films. Commonly described as a feminist road movie, ""Thelma and Louise"" has some important and meaningful things to say about feminism and female friendship. A strong, bold screenplay Oscar winning screenplay matches up with two strong, engaging and fully believable Oscar nominated lead acting performances by Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis. Davis has the more fully realized character here, a small edge over Sarandon's character. The trio of women behind this film: writer Chali Khouri, along with actresses Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis make for a powerful, bold and engaging film. Visually stylish cinematography from director Ridley Scott (of ""Blade Runner"" fame). With a slow start, the film has a number of impactful moments when it kicks into higher gear, spread throughout the film. The weaknesses are few and the strengths are many in this memorable, bold film. It's ending may seem oversized to some, but it suites me just fine. Thelma and Louise keep their friendship real until the end. ""Thelma and Louise"" represents Chali Khouri's feature film screen writing debut.",Thelma & Louise
269,ysiddiqaamin,Feminist symbolism or misogyny in action.,7,11 December 2018,"It's hard to tell where to stand on this one because it does subvert female stereotypes and serve as a tribute to the beauty of female friendship. There's no doubt that if it was a badass male lead shooting a baddie and then going on a crime heist across America in an attempt to escape - Prison Break comes to mind - they would be celebrated and the film would be praised for its eccentricity and bold comedy.
But there is no denying that in escaping from patriarchal clutches, Thelma and Louise go charging into impending doom. Thelma's character is inherently unlikeable and has either very 'blonde' moments or turns into a smooth-talking criminal both who were bound to have a short life span. Louise's conscience is apparent at stages of the film but as her smiles become more light and care-free she becomes callous. To explode a man's truck for his dirty gestures at them is a disproportionate response as well as reckless, because it leads the cops right on their heels.
The self sabotage throughout the film is disturbing and only confirms that a female-run world would be chaos. As a female, I found myself overwhelmed by the tragedy of these unravelling female characters and my heart felt like lead. I later read articles about the feminist symbolism in Thelma and Louise that comforted me. Nonetheless, I can't deny the discomfort I felt at watching two women escaping the patriarchy but becoming morally corrupt and eventually dying as a consequence.The question is if this is a moral story then to whom is it aimed at? If it is women, then it is saying that defeating the patriarchy will come a great personal sacrifice. If it is men, then the moral is if you screw over women, the fun ones will die.",Thelma & Louise

I almost turned it off at several points, but I decided to stick it out to the bitter end. I am not sure how this movie is labeled as feminist. These are not feminist characters. First, the movie depicts southern women (with inexpert accents by the actresses) as oppressed and unable to react to a difficult situation without becoming oppressors themselves. Feminism is not about shooting rapists or humiliating obscene truckers. It is a cartoon of feminism (as well as a cartoon of masculine behavior) that reinforces the negative stereotypes of anti-feminists.

This is a must for everybody. I cannot give this movie enough praise, it is definitely one of those movies where you are left dumbfounded after the credits have long finished.

Susan Sarandon, Geena Davis, Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, Brad Pitt!! Then there's the script by Callie Khouri -- great dialogue, plot is nuanced, action moves right along. The directing by Ridley Scott. The cinematography. The music. This is a beautifully layered movie, and I always thought it deserved more credit.

275,FabrizioParigi,That movie a chick flick ? Never in a month of Sundays,4,10 October 2004,"--Spoilers ahead--Those who claim that Thelma & Louise is a chick flick or a feminist movie must have just tasted the latest fancy drug. Thelma & Louise are 2 poor-frustrated-uptight ladies, who accidentally-unfortunately commit a crime. So that, after a moment of panic, they try their best to flee from the police, which they keep being afraid of till the end. Their getaway yet makes them reveal and express themselves on the loose. But at the same time, they can't help going on phoning their sweet husbands/men, before phoning back just to talk with the brilliant policeman who's after them and give him enough time to find where they call from. Oh yeah. Meanwhile, they don't forget to behave as righters of wrongs with a dull teamster (what a sweet message), to have great conversations like 'how beautiful a night', 'you are wonderful', 'I'm awake, you know, wide-awake like I've never been before', 'we've already lost all that we had to lose', or, with Brad Pitt, 'Thelma how is it you ain't got any kids? I mean God gets you something special, I think you oughta pass it on' (cause women are only made to make babies you know) and so on. And of course, we quickly learn that Louise has a heavy past actually, in Texas, yes she's been raped in another time. Therefore, you know, she's a victim, hey, that's why she shot the man, it's a legitimate-- revenge (oh, OK, I see).Afterwards, their marvelous road trip allows them to outrun obviously-stupid police cars in such gorgeous shots that show dozens (if not hundreds or thousands) of cops cars and a helicopter behind their nice and lonely little car. And guess what, they eventually realize they've taken a road that leads them to nowhere but to the top of a huge cliff above the Great Canyon. Terrific. So, after once more being portrayed as 2 poor victims by the so-smart Harvey Weinstein's character ('stop making them suffer' or 'hey you're gonna shoot women', hey right, feeble women can't be shot), they kiss each other, weep a little bit (coz feeble women a pleonasm certainly-- are used to weeping you know) and throw themselves into the emptiness. What a great script. Mix the whole thing with tons of moralistic clichés and some unbearable pop country music and you got it. This outstanding final metaphor just aims at making sure that you understand how appropriate and conventional, ie impoverished and empty, this insipid guys flick is",Thelma & Louise
276,hyunjoochang,Is there any hope?,5,20 February 2008,"The last scene, in which Thelma and Louise accelerate the car toward the cliff, reminds us of Ecclesiastes 1:2: ""Vanity of vanities, says the Teacher, vanity of vanities! All is vanity"" (NRSV). ""Meaningless! Meaningless! says the Teacher. Utterly meaningless! Everything is meaningless"" (NIV). I can hear Thelma and Louise's lament. They are crying when they smile. They want to stop fleeing and suffering, and they want to find real freedom.Thelma is a person who eager to be loved. She is looking for a person. She is seeking after the love which she is not able to find in real life. She is easily manipulated by men who pretend to love her and gets hurt more and more. Louise is a strict, closed person. She might have been raped before and be stuck in that deep wound. She has big anger inside, and the wound leads to her close-minded character. She is even not able to accept the proposal of marriage from a man whom she also loves.The move makes me raise the question of what good and evil are. Thelma and Louise are suffering from their past and from other people. They are victims of society and culture. Even though they commit sins such as murder and robbery, are they evil? I recall the words of Ecclesiastes 4:1-3: ""Again I saw all the oppressions that are practiced under the sun. Look the tears of the oppressed  with no one to comfort them! On the side of their oppressors there was power  with no one to comfort them. And I thought the dead, who have already died, more fortunate than the living, who are still alive; but better than both is the one who has not yet been, and has not seen the evil deeds that are done under the sun.""The last scene makes me cry. I can feel the great pain of Thelma and Louise and the desire to be free.Many men in the movie are described as people who just want to have their fleshly desire, sex. Most of people in that movie just care about themselves, their interests, and their own well-being. I agree that people are depraved in this world. We cannot find good in this world. It is hopeless world. Is there any hope? Let us consider Ecclesiastes 12:1, 13-14: ""Remember your creator in the days of your youth, before the days of trouble come, and the years draw near when you will say, 'I have no pleasure in them' The end of the matter; all has been heard. Fear God, and keep his commandments; for that is the whole duty of everyone. For God will bring every deed into judgment, including every secret thing, whether good or evil.""",Thelma & Louise

First things first, the plot: Well, there's not much I can say without spoiling the plot, but what I can say is this story of friendship unfolds fast, and carries the viewer through the entire adventure on the edge of his seat. There's also a hint of suspense in many parts of the movie which could not have concluded any better than they did.Acting: The actors fit the role like fingers in gloves; both Susan and Geena played convincing parts and deserved the nomination they received. The other characters of the story were introduced fittingly, and contributed their share accordingly. Some moments were so genuine, it was hard to believe it's only a movie.The cinematography: The camera work was smooth and artistic. The shots used were fitting to the mood, and the transition was excellent. There were no moments that seemed unfitting.Last and most definitely least, the bad: The flick left a few questions unanswered, and there were a few plot holes if you look carefully - but nothing that will stop the movie in it's tracks.I definitely suggest giving this movie a watch, its much better than anyone could expect.",Thelma & Louise

Susan Sarandon (Louise) who plays a housewife and Geena Davis (Thelma)who plays a waitress, decides to go on a trip they would not forget.this movie shows how two best friends did not give up on each other. they both had it rough with Louise wanted for murder and Thelma wanted for armed robbery they were a pair of bonnie and Clyde (1967) even with the police hot on their trail, they still manage to have fun times together. With Thelma drinking her wild turkey to both of them blowing up a disrespecting, womanizing driver's truck.This movie had me laughing and excited at the same time. today was the first time I had seen the movie and wondered was it going to be worth it. but after viewing this film it was definitely worth it.

When they shot the gas tanker i was laughing my head off at that horny little truck driver. he was a little odd.But all around, great movie. Kudos to the writer and all others that participated on this production. Quite a gem in the film archives.",Thelma & Louise
284,coolrider0789,True Inspiration and Friendship,10,27 March 2004,"I love this movie. I saw it for the first time today. It expresses the true meaning of friendship between these two women. They love and care for each other very much and will do anything to save the other one, never to give up on each other.The actors for this movie were a wonderful mix and the ending was just grand!!!The shot of their hands and the picture flying off was awesome. There is so much excitement during the movie. The cop chase, the bank robbery, the criminal. This is an original movie if I have ever seen one. The way Louise took up for insecure Thelma and then Thelma coming out strong in the end and helping Louise gain strength in the end. I now see why this movie is so popular.",Thelma & Louise
285,bertie001,Was Darryl's part overlooked in this film?,9,5 June 2006,"The part of Darryl played by Christopher McDonald has been overlooked in this great film and needs to be highlighted. First we see him playing the self obsessed, selfish, chauvinist pig type character in the early scenes. We laugh at him as he stands in his pizza as the cop tells him his wife was seen leaving the scene of the crime. Then there was a wonderful moment when they are all watching a movie and he flicks to the sports channel only to be met with looks of disapproval from all seated. The macho cop stereotype comes crashing down as all are engrossed in the romantic Cary Grant movie. This time we laugh with him as opposed to laughing at him. We begin to warm to him as he starts to bond with these men that have temporarily taken over his household. And finally the poignant moment as he looks into camera, tears rolling down his face as he slowly realises the wife he knew and most probably loved very dearly, was not going to come out of this alive. If only he could have been a better husband, if only he treated her better. Buts its all too late for him to make things better. He has lost her.A sad moment indeed, if only the director lingered on this moment a little longer. I think it would have made the movie even better.Does anyone else think his part was too overshadowed by the main characters or just by the right amount? ""And you know what they call a Quarter Pounder with Cheese in Paris?. They call it a Royale with cheese.""",Thelma & Louise
286,elena04009,Everything in this movie clicks,10,28 June 2005,"""Thelma and Louise"" is now one of my favorite movies. Why??? Because the whole movie clicks from start to finish... each character couldn't be better cast, the songs blend right into the feelings in the movie, Susan Sarandon and Geena Davis were born to play these two parts and they are just right for one another too, everything was perfect. A lot of feeling, laughs, heart-pounding, empathy..... Harvey Keital was great, especially at the end when he realized what they were thinking and he started running..... I consoled myself at the end by telling myself the car made it to the other side of the canyon, yet knowing it couldn't have. Did this movie win an Oscar for anything??????",Thelma & Louise
287,steerpike58,"Awesome movie, and not worthy of the criticisms!",10,29 December 2013,"I happen to adore this movie. The scenery alone made me want to explore the American South West, and the transformation of Gina Davis from docile housewife to adventure seeker is simply something to behold; I've never seen her so radiant. If I got nothing else out of this movie, that would have been enough. But the film is also extremely funny; how can you not love the scene where Gina says "" ... I just feel like I got a knack for this sh*t"" after robbing the store? Sure, her husband is a caricature, but he's as funny as hell. Keitel is understated, and the other cop (Tobolowsky) is delightful. The car is beautifully presented (yes, even the car is a star...), and the road scenes are outstanding. I personally think the 'truck driver' scene is over the top, but it's a bit of light relief. So why do some people hate this movie? Beats me ... I'm a 55 year old guy and love it!",Thelma & Louise
288,rmatser,I loved Thelma and Louise,8,7 April 2005,"The ending, its very European. I'm writing a dutch movie about two woman. It's kind of difficult to be in the mind of a woman. It helped me to understand certain kind of things, thoughts. Funny is that Brad Pitt is in the movie, it was a surprise for me. I recommend this movie to women and men. If men feel ""bashed"" then you watched the right kind of movie and you have to change your life. Good story. Good structure. Good ending and above all emotional moving. Its the first time that I write a comment on a movie and for me (writing in English), I live in Amsterdam, its difficult to write ten lines (which is the minimum length). However, watch this movie!! Robert.",Thelma & Louise
289,ron-dy,one of the great American classics,10,18 February 2019,"I was 16 when I watched this movie a year after it had come out. This is one of those rare movies you can watch over and over again and you do not want to end it as it takes you into a different realm, an emotional state where you become completely absorbed by the characters, their dreams and desires.Thelma and Louise are mythic characters as they represent the hero's journey to freedom, from their ordinary lives, shackled by men - Louise's bad history with men and Thelma belligerent and infantile husband - they take off on journey that will transform them into outlaws, into travelers of the unknown and at the same time becoming fully realized human beings.This is a quintessential American Film, with its photography of landscapes and Film Noir look. It made me wanted to travel across the US, the western states in particular as it landscapes of the great wide open represent the American Dream of 'freedom' as if it was sculpted specifically into it. There is not a better road movie ever made than this one with the perfect script, a great director knowing his craft, strong performances by the entire cast, the soundtrack and the score driving the emotional ride you are on, and believe me, you don't want that ride to end.And for all men who heard this is feminist movie - it's not. I am a man and love this movie for all what America stands for and that is finding your own inner freedom.",Thelma & Louise
290,armenianbonsai,Love it!,10,9 June 2017,Simply the best movie made in the 90s! Love the acting and especially the chemistry between Geena Davis and Susan Surandon! I feel ashamed that I haven't seen this movie before! Man or woman you will enjoy this film! It is not a stupid revenge fantasy as some critise but a rather unique movie about friendship and the untold struggles of women in society! 10/10 Love it!,Thelma & Louise
291,vivlavi38,vivlavi38,10,27 October 2005,"The look on Louise's face when she says : - In the future, when a woman's crying like that, she's never having any fun !, intends that she was rapped because she looks very angry. Louise's reaction when Thelma asks her what happened to her in Texas is a little bit excessive in comparison with Thelma's question. In these two scenes we can see the anger in Louise's eyes. That's why I guess that Louise was rapped in Texas. I use this commentary to say that Susan and Geena are THE BEST ACTRESSES I'VE EVER SEEN, cause we can know what they think just to look at them when they're playing!!!!! (Sorry for the mistakes but I'm french...)",Thelma & Louise
292,esqbaby,The Brad Pitt Story Line,5,28 January 2007,"I would like to know if it bothers anyone else that she is so eager to hook up with Brad Pitt so quickly after she is almost raped, AND sees a man getting shot, partly because of her actions. Does this bother anyone else? I think anyone who has been in that situation isn't so quick to jump into bed with anyone (even if it is Brad Pitt)....I think this part of the story line was put in to show how free and liberated Thelma was; however, I think its quite implausible. I'm very surprised this was allowed to stay in the movie, especially because a woman has written/directed the movie. Does anybody else feel this way or am I overreacting and not allowing myself to realize its ""just a movie?""",Thelma & Louise
293,r-94327,A sad movie,9,6 June 2018,"I felt so depressed while I watched this movie. It's so hard to survive as a woman in the society. You have to keep a good figure, cater to your husband, stay naive, make a balance between being vulnerable and strong-minded. Even you have done so much, It's still posssible for you not to be respected by males,just like Thelma in the movie, who was detested by her husband and forced to have sex with a stranger male. It is very suffocating to watch a movie like this as a female because it's very easy for female audience to identify the tragedies happened on females.",Thelma & Louise
294,ilovecoolcat,great & sad,7,29 January 2006,"""Let's not get caught."" That's the last word that Thelma told Louise.Two women went on vacation for escaping the reality of their life; the reality of being pushed around by boss and mistreated by husband. However, one thing they don't know is that being caught is their destinies. They are already set up to be caught by this society.Two victims of rape. Two victims of the lies of marriage and love.They are caught by ""power"". Two white women on the road with two guns. They thought those guns can bring them the power, instead they bring them troubles. Not the fault of guns. It is their fault----they are women. Once the thing in women's hand, it isn't power anymore, because power is predefine as what belong to men.They were chased, because they are not ""women"". They are not ""women"" because women don't use guns. They are not ""men"", because they are women. They are meant to be caught, because one is either a man or woman, if one want to change the definition, one ought to be eliminated.They are caught by ""responsibilities"". House and work chores that are not do any good to them. No life fulfillment, no appreciation. They should do men favors since the society teaches that women are sex objects. If someone ask you ""baby, are u ready for a big dick?"", as a woman , you should say yes.A man was shot. A man was locked in the trunk. A man's truck was bowled up. A man stole $625.5. A man neglected his wife. A man is in charge of the investment. A man asked other men to chase, to block, to control.They did not want to challenge men. Thelma wants to have fun with them. Louise wants to forget what they have done to her. Even after a couple of incidents that make them ""guilty"", they only want to run away.They don't want to be caught. they cry out. Let's not get caught. Then, they speed up. Drive away from the side in which all men are guarding with guns. They drive off the cliff. In the air. Where they will land? Where? A place in which a woman says no means no? a place in which rape cases can be justified? Maybe, a place where has no rapist? Sisters, let's not get caught by sexism, ageism, classism, racism, etc.Let's not get caught by injustice, stereotypes, objectification, etc.Let's just not get caught by things we are not sign up to.",Thelma & Louise
