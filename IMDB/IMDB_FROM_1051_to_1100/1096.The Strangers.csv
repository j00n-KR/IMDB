0,bkoganbing,They Don't Cotton To Strangers In That Neighborhood,2,6 June 2008,"What starts out as a night where Scott Speedman is expecting some nookie and kanoodling with Liv Tyler in a nice little rural hideaway turns into a desperate fight for their lives as some folks with masks start raising all kinds of trouble. Some people just don't like strangers in their neighborhood.There certainly is a market for these slasher flicks and some folks actually liked this one by the reviews I see. These are people who just like to be frightened, but these kind of films have always left me cold.Our three villains include two women and one man. The women where Halloween masks while the man makes do with a burlap sack over his face. Maybe it's the Unknown Comic in a new outfit or burlap is in for psychopaths this season.Anyway that's money and time I certainly will never get back.",The Strangers
1,Leofwine_draca,A film as expressionless as its masked killers,3,1 January 2017,"""Home invasion"" horrors seem to have enjoyed a resurgence as of late, THE STRANGERS one of a handful of similar titles to hit cinemas in recent years: there was the French shocker THEM, the US remake of FUNNY GAMES, motel chiller VACANCY, even THE LAST HOUSE ON THE LEFT remake explores similar themes of sudden, unexpected violence intruding in our own homes and neighbourhoods. THE STRANGERS attracted a little controversy after supposedly being based on a true story – a still unexplained murder in which a woman and three kids were brutally killed in their own home one night by supposed strangers without a motive. The sad truth is that the true story, which I read about online, is far more interesting than this clichéd, boring, and frankly forgettable attempt at horror. Heck, even the behind-the-scenes footage on the DVD was more interesting than the film itself.The problems with this film are tenfold. The entire lack of a plot doesn't help – unless you count the expository first ten minutes, which introduce a central couple who are so caught up in themselves that you instantly dislike them. From then on, minor events are dragged out for endless minutes as the characters face a cat-and-mouse game with masked attackers. Plot points are ten, sometimes twenty minutes apart and between then we just get ominous music and noises on the soundtrack. Can you say repetitive? It's as if the film-makers saw the last ten minute showdown between Jamie Lee Curtis and Michael Myers in HALLOWEEN and decided to expand it to feature length.I'm not saying this concept can't work; indeed, some films featuring just a couple of characters in a room work very well. THEM did it expertly, building tons of atmosphere without ever showing much. The newcomer who made this film, Bryan Bertino, seems to have no skill when it comes to suspense, world-building, or scares; we just get endless repetition. The first time we hear somebody knocking on the door is creepy – the next ten times isn't. There's no twist ending, no catch, just mundane stuff everywhere you look, as cliché piles on cliché before the non-ending that makes you think ""is that it?"". Liv Tyler is poor as the heroine in peril; Speedman featureless and wooden. The masked bad guys have the potential to be scary – if the look of the main one hadn't been copied from THE ORPHANAGE. I hear a sequel is to follow, but my question is why? This is about as bland, non-scary, and predictable as movie-making gets, a film as expressionless as its masked killers.",The Strangers
2,SnoopyStyle,could be scary for people in the right mind,5,5 October 2015,"It's Feb 11, 2005. Kristen McKay (Liv Tyler) and James Hoyt (Scott Speedman) return to Hoyt family summer home after attending a friend's wedding reception. There seems to be something between them. Then someone knocks on the door. A mysterious girl is asking for Tamara. They send her away. James leaves to get Kristen cigarettes and the girl returns. It's a night of terror as they are hounded by masked strangers.The start has no energy. Both Tyler and Speedman are mumbling their lifeless dialog. The movie grinds along slowly. Although it may be scary for people watching this in their big houses by themselves. This could be an effective horror for the right person. For me, it's not that compelling.",The Strangers
3,claudio_carvalho,"A Boring and Stupid Rip-off of ""Ils""",3,27 March 2009,"Along the night in the cottage of his father, James Hoyt (Scott Speedman) and his girlfriend Kristen McKay (Liv Tyler) are terrified by a trio of sick trespassers.It is amazing the capacity of destroy good movies that some pretentious writers and directors have. This unknown Bryan Bertino made a rip-off of the gem ""Ils"", which is one of the scariest movies I have ever seen, without any credit to the original movie, and destroyed the frightening atmosphere of that film with many stupid scenes. For example, why James did not believe on Kristen? Why Mike did not call the police when the arrived in the partially destroyed house? Why the couple, armed with a powerful gun, did not lock themselves up in the bathroom? Scott Speedman has an awful performance, and Liv Tyler has a good work. And that is all. Prefer watching the French- Romanian movie (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0465203/) instead of this crap. My vote is three.Title (Brazil): ""Os Estranhos"" (""The Strangers"")",The Strangers
4,nogodnomasters,LIV TYLER FALLS FROM GRACE,3,20 July 2018,"SO THIS IS THE SEQUEL?I don't know where to start. It wasn't that great. The ending of the movie epitomized the deplorable script writing. Stella is attempting to tell the world about vampires while the government is trying to cover it up. The local FBI man is in cahoots with the vampires as he desires to be one. A group of vampire hunters meets Stella in her room and asks her to join them (along with a turncoat vampire) to go into the underground tunnels of L.A. and hunt down and kill Lilith, the vampire queen. Lilith speaks a strange tongue with subscripts, until the very end when she can suddenly speak English. The acting wasn't all that great. This is another movie which uses the high tech ""special effect"" of jerking the camera around to make us feel the terror of the scene (yawn!) because the script can't do it.Lilith, in ancient folklore, fed off the blood on infants. They seemed to have messed that up too. If you watched the first one, go ahead and get disappointed on this one.",The Strangers
5,kosmasp,Strange,7,29 September 2008,"Apart from the ""based on true ..."" thing on the beginning, which by the way is my new big NO for a movie ... I just can't stand that hypocritical use of this phrase. Every other movie is than based on true events. Most of the romantic comedies are, teen comedies etc. etc. At least some parts are true or did happen in real life, which is why the script writer ""thought"" them up ...But I should stop ranting about that (and the fact, that a voice over at the beginning of the movie, isn't entirely ""correct"" ... well you see). This movie promises to scare you and it delivers. Mood-wise it stays close to a french movie called ""Ils"" (Them), which was a great suspense thriller/horror. I also liked the relationships between the two main characters. You could say it's standard fare, but it has great framing and lighting (sound design is ""scary"" too).",The Strangers
6,Sleepin_Dragon,The art of subtlety.,7,30 March 2019,"It would be so easy to dismiss the very deliberate pacing of this film as pedestrian, but in this day and age of gratuitous violence and constant gore, this film relies on the ability to slowly torment you, as toy watch the hideous way in which the young couple are subjected to the night from Hell.At the time I genuinely did find this a very unsettling, unnerving watch, going home to an empty house after this was unsettling.Ignore those that call it boring, trust me, it isn't, it's paced in a way that throws you off guard.No clear begining, or end, just a series of random events. It's a grim movie. 7/10",The Strangers
7,lee_eisenberg,they made something really creative here,7,11 November 2008,"I knew nothing about ""The Strangers"" when I started watching it. When it became clear that the movie was a horror flick, I figured that it was going to be a typical slasher. But there's more to it than that.A message at the beginning tells the audience that the depicted events are true (or at least a possibility of what happened). We get introduced to James Hoyt (Scott Speedman) and Kristen McKay (Liv Tyler), apparently having some problems. But then a young woman comes to their door and asks for a person who doesn't live in the house. She later returns, and noises start appearing around the house. That's when the real story sets in.The horror derives from never knowing who the killers are, or what their motives are. They are just masked figures with no aim except to torment James and Kristen. Because of the timing and editing in some scenes, I doubt that you'll be able to watch this movie without jumping in at least one scene.I should identify that this isn't a great movie. There are some clichés like heavy breathing and sobbing (or might the true story have happened like that?). But they do the right thing by keeping gore to a minimum and letting the story develop. Therefore, I recommend ""The Strangers"".",The Strangers
8,Woodyanders,Spooky and suspenseful horror chiller,8,18 March 2013,"Kristen McKay (a fine and credible performance by Liv Tyler) and her boyfriend James Hoyt (a sound and convincing portrayal by Scott Speedman) go to a vacation house that's deep in the woods after attending a wedding reception. Kristen and James find their lives threatened when three vicious and merciless enigmatic strangers decide to lay siege to said home. Writer/director Bryan Bertino takes time to carefully develop the sympathetic main characters, does a deft job of creating and sustaining a truly creepy atmosphere, keeps the narrative taut and on course throughout, and generates plenty of nerve-rattling tension. The grim nihilistic tone, the stark simplicity of the story, the fact that the basic premise is something that could actually happen, and the pleasing air of eerie ambiguity -- we never find out who exactly the strangers are or why they are terrorizing this particular couple -- further add to this film's overall deeply unsettling impact. Moreover, the remote sylvan setting radiates a scary feeling of isolation and vulnerability. Kip Weeks, Laura Margolis, and especially Gemma Ward are positively bloodcurdling as the titular threesome. Peter Sova's crisp cinematography makes extremely effective use of shadowy lighting and a constantly roving restless camera. The spare shuddery score by tomandandy does the spine-shivering trick. A real spot-on harrowing nail-biter.",The Strangers
9,rmax304823,Genus: Slasher.,2,9 September 2009,"A couple return late at night from a party to their isolated woodland home. Liv Tyler is the pretty, tall, bony woman. Scott Speedman is her quiet, hesitant mate. They're interrupted when they're about to make love when a series of insistent thumps sounds on the solid wooden front door. They're terrorized. They retreat to various places in the house. It's all useless. They're both captured, ties to chairs, and then killed with a knife. The three murderers wear a Halloween mask, a leathery face, and a hockey face guard. Something like that. Their faces are never shown to the audience, but who the hell cares? They have no motives either. They're pure evil.The movie stinks.First, it has every conceivable cliché. The husband, Speedman, is soft-spoken and doesn't know how to load a shotgun. (He calls the cartridges ""bullets"".) Usually in these kinds of movies the guy has his leg broken near the beginning, but this character doesn't need it. He's already impotent.When someone picks up a kitchen knife from the shag rug, there is the ""slink"" sound of metal against metal.Every unusual movement is accompanied by a loud ""sting"" in the score -- if someone touches someone else's shoulder: WHAMMM! When a visiting friend pulls up in the driveway he's greeted by a shotgun blast through the windshield. What would you do? Here's what HE does. He gets out of the car, looks at the big hole in his windshield, mutters, ""What the ****?"", and quietly creeps into the house, carefully and slowly picking his way among the overturned furniture, not saying a word, until the reaches the beleaguered couple's locked room and knocks. Boom. Hubby gets off a blast from the gun after all, just before he throws it away in disgust, despite the three figures still sneaking around with axes and what not.Lots of terror, plenty of blood, death all over the place -- and absolutely no point at all.Or maybe there is! That's even worse. Is there actually a market demand for this odious torture porn? Who are we?",The Strangers
10,BA_Harrison,"Watch it alone, late at night, with the doors and windows unlocked. I dare you.",8,1 November 2008,"The Strangers, a chilling tale of a well-to-do couple (played by Scott Speedman and Liv Tyler) forced to fight for their lives against three senseless killers who invade their home, lacks both the strong narrative and sense of closure usually attempted (but not always delivered) by most genre offerings. Instead, it opts to go for unbearable tension and well constructed shock scenes (although it perhaps offers one too many jump scares), with absolutely no explanation for the savage attacks, no twist ending to make sense of what we have witnessed, and no lone survivor somehow finding the strength to rise up and defeat the killers.My immediate reaction to The Strangers was, 'that was scary, but where was the plot and the ending, and what was the point?'. However, having slept on it, I realise now that that is exactly why the film is so powerful: it's brutally honest!Real life horror rarely follows the Hollywood formula: people die for no reason and there is often no retribution; writer/director Bryan Bertino reflects this idea perfectly in his movie, whilst also delivering a non-stop roller-coaster ride of terror, utilising hand held cameras, low-key lighting, and sparse-but-effective use of music to create an atmosphere of unbearable suspense. The result is a film that might leave you feeling a little unsatisfied at the end, but it is one that will linger in the mind, continuing to gnaw at your subconscious with its chilling message: life can be short, unpredictable, unfair and nasty, and there's not a lot you can do about it.Now that is scary!!",The Strangers
11,moonspinner55,"All shuddery style; no script, no characters, nothing...",4,27 October 2010,"Writer-director Bryan Bertino has said in interviews that he based his idea for ""The Strangers"" on the Manson murders and also ""a real event"" which occurred in Bertino's neighborhood when he was a child. The latter portion of the statement is most important, as it shows Bertino's cynical aim to create some kind of rural myth--perhaps another ""Blair Witch""--with a script that is largely made up of episodes from other pictures (""The Virgin Spring"", ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"", ""Halloween"", etc.). An unmarried young couple, staying at the woodsy, unoccupied summer home of the man's family, is terrorized by three masked assailants, who seemingly harbor the uncanny ability to appear out of nowhere (and disappear the same way) without making a sound. Right away there's a problem with the cellphones, and a car is pretty much destroyed in the driveway without the couple taking notice. The actors are left helpless. Liv Tyler, so promising in her early roles, is utterly wasted here...and by the time she's crawling around in the dirt at night--or worse, hopping on one foot--the audience stops seeing her as a living, breathing character in danger for her life. She becomes just another brainless target in another mindless horror movie. *1/2 from ****",The Strangers
12,Quinoa1984,"alternately subtle/ambiguous, and badly stylized and ultimately pointless",4,5 June 2008,"For a first-time director Bryan Bertino has a lot to learn, but there are some points for trying. He loves the genre, and according to interviews, wanted to give a 70's slasher movie feel to his film the Strangers. It's about a newly engaged couple who are a little uneasy about this next step (she is, anyway), and then while at a cabin that is his family's old place are harassed/stalked/hunted by three young psychos- all wearing masks- and over the course of a night make their lives a living cat-and-mouse game of hell.With this premise, Bertino does have something interesting at the start, which is to accomplish a feat one usually doesn't see in horror, which is to make some subtlety in the script, the interactions with the characters played by Speedman and Tyler. What isn't said is even more powerful than what is (as is the case in general, however in a familiar mode, once the suspense starts). And there are some genuine scares and creepy bits spread throughout, mostly in the ""is that what I think it is in the background"" sense. Bertino does quickly master the jump-at-the-little-to-damn-huge things method of horror.What he doesn't master, at all, are some basics of directing. He has hand-held going through the entire feature, even during the opening scenes where one might want a little calmness with the camera. Where a stedi-cam might provide some more easy access to the characters, it's all distracting to see the camera moving about from side to side and up and down. Where his ideas are trying to reach back to trashy horror, his approach is amateurish. Perhaps if you're a novice to the genre a lot of the scares provided, as well as the violence, will seem original and shocking. But as someone who's seen his share of horror, I can say with some certainty that he treads some really familiar ground here. The big ""gotcha"" midway through is from a genuine mistake on the part of the protagonists, and aside from that it's business as usual.Yet what drags this pleasantly usual horror flick down further is that the director cheats the audience at the climax/end scenes. He tries to do something ""different"" to make it seem like a more realistic or random tale of horror by having the villains take off their masks, and then *not* showing what they look like to the audience (save for one girl who is seen in darkness earlier in the film). This, and then a scene with Christian folk who run into the killers on their way out, make for a really frustrating catharsis. At the end of all of these shenanigans, what's the point? That 'real-life' violence is horrible and without a true face? Bolderdash, I say! 4.5/10",The Strangers
13,Coventry,"A Stranger is a Friend you haven't met yet? Hmm, not quite...",6,9 September 2008,"It isn't a secret that the horror industry suffers from a severe lack of originality lately. Albeit still immensely popular, the genre nowadays only brings forward remakes of older successful classics or recycled versions of one and the same concept. ""The Strangers"" isn't a remake, but it's pretty much identical to the earlier released movies ""Vacancy"", ""Funny Games"" (which also received an American remake this year), ""Them"" and probably a handful of other titles I can't think of at the moment. All these movies make full use of the 'back-to-basics' principle. People are being tormented and terrorized by other people for no apparent reason. It's simple, usually effective, doesn't cost a fortune on special effects and location spotting, gives the director the opportunity to use all the clichés the genre has to offer and you can even easily link it to horrific events that really occurred. There's an actual spoken introduction claiming the depicted events are just one example of thousands of cases of senseless and unexplained violence that take place in America each year. Well yes, we're surely living in a rotten world. If you disregard the fact that ""The Strangers"" is thoroughly unoriginal and predictable from start to finish, you'll still have to admit that it's also a professionally made thriller with some extended moments of genuine tension as well as a few really efficient jump-scenes. The essence of ""The Strangers"" can be summarized in one sentence only. James and Kristen, a young couple residing in his father's remote holiday villa, become the targets of three relentless and sadistic masked perpetrators during one night of terror, fear and cruelty. That's the main plot, but our young writer/director Bryan Bertino uses some ancient tricks first to make us feel identifiable and sympathetic with the lead couple. The entire first act of the film revolves on their relationship issues that we gradually learn to know through brief flashbacks and the players' body language. By the time the perpetrators arrive on their doorstep, we already feel sorry for James and Kristen and yet their suffering has yet to begin! This exact same trick was also attempted in the aforementioned ""Vacancy"", but it works so much better here. Compared to Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale in ""Vacancy"", Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman at least argue in silence and seem a lot more emotionally troubled. The transition from relationship drama into stalk-n-terror thriller happens quite smoothly and, even though the middle-section is just an endless series of all the known genre clichés, Bertino manages to keep you alert and compelled throughout the rest of the film. The titular strangers are reasonably creepy villains, wearing uncanny masks and making clear this is nothing but a purposeless game for them. They're not in a hurry to kill their victims, but toy with their emotions instead and even provoke them to turn towards using violence first. The climax is supposed to have a shocking and deeply disturbing impact, but unfortunately, watching a massive amount of similar movies turned us all into rudderless and sentiment-free creatures. As said, what a cruel and rotten world we live in",The Strangers
14,michaelRokeefe,Pressure cooker thriller.,7,24 October 2008,"A psychological thriller directed by Bryan Bertino. Forget popcorn and soft drinks; try a fistful of Xanax and adult diapers. Sorry, that was foolishly going overboard. THE STRANGERS will have you drowning in anxiety and listening to your own blood chill. A young suburban couple Kristen(Liv Tyler)and James(Scott Speedman)need some peace and quiet and time to think as they arrive at a secluded family vacation home. You don't always get what you want. Rapping at the door becomes bagging on the door. Strangers staring at the house and peeking through writing on the windows. It is a living nightmare as three masked strangers invade the couple's privacy. It is amazing what you can bring yourself to do when survival is on the line. This is not the time to hear someone at the door or your cellphone to ring. It is so much fun to be terrified.",The Strangers
15,hitchcockthelegend,Tired old premise not really given new impetus.,4,21 January 2009,"Kristen McKay and James Hoyt return from a night out to find a knock at the door at some ungodly hour. What follows is a terrifying invasion as three masked raiders torment and attack the couple at frequent intervals, can the couple find within them the strength to survive their ordeal?The horror genre is a tough cookie to work out these days, so many remakes and re-images rightly suggest that it's a genre in steady decline. Occasionally hope of a resurgence is offered up by the likes of hyperbole supremo's like Eli Roth and here with first time writer and director, Bryan Bertino. If these guys promised half of what they proclaimed they would do with their respective horror entries, well the genre would be born again and the fans would be rejoicing around the graveyards.The Strangers is not a bad film by any stretch of the entrails, it's just not a particularly good one, and certainly not the original and fresh home invasion spin promised by Bertino. The premise of course is very solid, we all as human beings live in perpetual fear of a home invasion by psychos or chav like aggressors (the latter of concern to UK residents, see Eden Lake for example), and with this pro porting to be based on real events, the impact was waiting to, well impact, but questionable resources from our besieged couple just add a shrug of the shoulders to an already yawning audience. The project had been on the back burner for a couple of years, with the script being altered by Bertino from its early incarnations, I wonder just how much was changed because it looks to me that Bertino has altered an intended psychological chiller, and instead settled for a blend of boo jump scares and edginess, and it fails to successfully achieve either.The film also suffers badly by having two lead actors barely up to the job of convincing as terrified victims. Liv Tyler can sit adequate in the most basic of acting roles, but when it calls for a role to get the audience involved she sadly comes up short. Scott Speedman can act, but here he seems lost within the confines of a poorly written character, both actors unable to carry the film to any sort of genre highlight. The ending to the piece just about works, and pair that with the creepiness of the masked raiders then The Strangers just about sits in the average horror department. But really we are no further forward than when we had the mighty and magnificent Black Christmas back in 1974, at least the likes of Vacancy (almost killed by its ending) from 2007 have a sense of adventure about them, setting out (and delivering) honest intentions from the off, likable leads and a willingness to entertain whilst knowing its limitations. Sadly The Strangers is a missed opportunity to create something memorable and totally scary, director Bertino's next protect, Alone, could quite possibly make or break a fledgling genre career. 5/10",The Strangers
16,Scarecrow-88,The Strangers,5,7 April 2009,"Well, I finally watched it and can easily say that some decisions made really ticked me off. They just have to go and spoil the entire film(..the ""Dark City"" syndrome if you will) by announcing not only in the narration but the opening scene displaying the ""morning after"". Talk about shooting yourself in the foot. This was the same problem I had with Texas CHAINSAW MASSACRE THE BEGINNING..If you already know the victimized characters' fates how can you really get into a film? I wasn't drawn in because I knew it couldn't possibly go well for the couple thanks to the opening minutes summoning up their fates.And, as usual the female victim twists her ankle, makes so much racket stumbling into things people miles down the road could hear her, and she's constantly screaming. She might as well stood out in the yard with a GIANT bullseye and said ""hit me with your best shot"".I will say that I thought that the filmmakers took pointers from Dean Cundy on how to lens their masked villains..because the whole time they'd show up, Michael Myers came to mind immediately. This I liked really well, although I think the murderess in INSIDE was even better a menace, appearing from the shadows.Speaking of INSIDE, I immediately thought of a certain accidental murder that occurred in that movie and saw the surprise death in THE STRANGERS coming before it even happened.Horror has come full circle really. Used to filmmakers preyed on your fears in regards to being caught in an unfamiliar territory where no one could save you(..whether it be in the shower of the Bates Motel, out in the water as the Great White draws ever so close, in the farmhouse of a maniac wearing a mask made of human skin, wielding a chainsaw, in the space ship Nostromo where the alien hunts for victims or in the dark torture rooms of a faraway third-world country), but now there's really no escape because even in the comforts of your own home(..or a close relative's summer home)the predators are around somewhere to cause terror to victims. The movie goes out of it's way to make the couple, Tyler and Speedman, stumble, trip and fall all over themselves as the kid killers, under creepy masks, stalk them quietly and methodically. It calls Columbine back to your attention and as of late, those kids haven't quite killing. THE STRANGERS, in that regard(..although, I'm one of those who considers ILS(THEM)a better candidate)taps into something truly vital, that impacts. Too bad, the filmmakers clue us into how the whole situation will end right at the start.",The Strangers
17,Hey_Sweden,"Has some good moments, some not so good.",6,7 August 2013,"""The Strangers"" looks to be another of those polarizing features that either works for the viewer or doesn't. Key to how much or how little you enjoy it will depend on whether you feel any sympathy for the victims and if you can tolerate their admittedly silly courses of action. It is commendable that writer / director Bryan Bertino should try to create a traditional suspense film (albeit one that lapses into gore and (very mild) torture as it nears its end).Basing this on a supposedly true story, he relates to us a tale of James Hoyt (Scott Speedman) and Kristen McKay (Liv Tyler). They're not doing so well; she's turned down his marriage proposal and they're both in a bad mood. Well, their moods aren't going to get any better: three masked individuals show up at about 4:00 in the morning and soon proceed to terrorize this hapless duo, over and over again and into the dawn.There's really no character development in this 86 minute exercise in suspense and atmosphere. Be warned that James and Kristen don't get any smarter as the story plays out. Still, as I said in the summary, it's not without some well realized tension. (Though I have to question why blast that country song in that one scene; it renders the scene ineffective.) Speedman and Tyler are likable enough performers but they don't have much to work with here. Gorgeous, slick cinematography, by Peter Sova, can only help so much. The script falls right into some of the clichés of the genre, like the leading actress falling down while running (and injuring herself in the bargain). At least the three actors playing the nearly mute antagonists manage to be somewhat creepy.It would be nice, just for once, to see a story where the intended victims act intelligently and the villain is forced to take a new approach, or think on their feet. Too many bad guys in this type of film rarely experience anything resembling a challenge.Six out of 10.",The Strangers
18,preppy-3,One of those rare films that shows the creepiest scares are the quiet ones,7,8 June 2008,"An unhappy couple (well played by Scott Speedman and Liv Tyler) are spending a weekend at a house in the middle of nowhere. They're not happy--he proposed to her and she turned him down. Things are tense between them--but then people start knocking on the door (at 4am) and asking for people who don't live there. This escalates and Tyler and Speedman find themselves fighting for their lives against a trio of killers.The scariest part of this film is in the trailer (explaining why they picked that couple) but it's still well worth seeing. The attackers all wear these masks (which make them scarier). As I said before, Speedman and Tyler are great and this is NOT one of those stupid films that have those annoying jump ""scares"" that every horror film recently has. One of the scariest scenes has Tyler alone in the house and you see the guy of the trio watching her. You're on edge because you're wondering WHAT he's going to do to her. A lot of the film is like that--you never know where the killers are till they pop up. It's not perfect, it's very quick (85 minutes) and has a REALLY stupid jump scare at the end. Still, there's very little blood and gore and the film really works on your emotions. Well done and scary. A 7.",The Strangers

One could say that it's a ""Slow Burn Starter"", and that would be Correct. A Clunky (What the Hell is going on?) Start would be more Accurate.

20,dbborroughs,"Reaistic, disturbing to be sure; but I'm not really sure why I was watching it",5,15 June 2008,"Well made and realistic portrait of a group of psychos terrorizing a couple who come home from a friends wedding. Thats as basic a plot as you can get without going into details. I'm not sure what I make of the whole affair. While its realism is a plus I really don't see the point. What do we get from seeing a story such as this? I don't know. To be certain this could mirror what may happen in a sadistic home invasion, but at the same time did I really need to see this compressed to 90 minutes. I think that the presence of Liv Tyler both helped the film get a release, but also makes you wonder if the film actually is up to something more. I'm not sure and find that it kind of dances close to the torture porn line. And yes its well made and yes it has frightening images but I don't know if its ""good"" (I think it plods on too much).Its this amorphous something that is neither fish not fowl, much like the claims its based on a true incident yet having the disclaimer in the credits thats its really just fiction.

21,Bunuel1976,"THE STRANGERS {Unrated Extended Version} (Bryan Bertino, 2008) **",5,10 April 2010,"While it is not recorded as such, as THE STRANGERS was unfolding before my eyes, I realized it was virtually a remake of the French horror film THEM (2006), which I had watched only a few days ago! The premise of a young couple being trapped in their house – and eventually murdered for kicks – by mysterious assailants (masked in this case rather than unseen) who turn out to be thrill-seeking teens is still scary as a concept; nevertheless, this situation has now been picked up by so many film-makers of late that it only serves to highlight the genuine classiness of similarly-themed movies of the past like Richard Brooks' IN COLD BLOOD (1967) and Claude Chabrol's LA CEREMONIE (1995). While debuting director Bryan Bertino does provide non-discriminating viewers with a couple of suspenseful scenes, the situations depicted generally come across as far too mechanical (especially that inevitable yet utterly pointless final ""Boo!"" moment)! Especially unsatisfying is an opening section that is both muddled and slow-moving: this effectively dissipates the empathy one is supposed to feel towards its protagonists: Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman, from the first two entries of the UNDERWORLD horror saga! One important (albeit ill-advised) variation is that our beleaguered heroes here are likewise armed with a shotgun: however, they are hopeless with it – even mistakenly blowing away a close acquaintance who comes to visit!! For the record, the masks lend the villains a decidedly creepy touch: the ""Sack-head"" character, then, may well have been inspired by the serial-killer at the center of the cult classic THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN (1976). Similarly to the latter and THEM itself, the film under review is said to have been inspired by real eventsbut one has to question some of the characters' illogical actions (going out to buy cigarettes or calling on friends in the very early hours of the morning)!!",The Strangers
22,utgard14,Not my thing,4,21 July 2014,"For the kind of movie that The Strangers is, it's well put together with some decent direction and a good deal of suspense. Yes it is full of clichés and expected jump scares, but they're managed well. The plot is about as bare bones as it gets: a couple at an isolated house are terrorized by masked killers for no apparent reason. The couple is played by Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman. They both do fine considering there's little more to their parts than being scared then angry and then scared again. The opening narration claiming it to be based off of a true story is either a rip-off or an homage of Texas Chainsaw Massacre. You can decide which.I'm not a big fan of home invasion horror movies. All too often they're nihilistic, ugly, and they glorify killers. It can be said that movies with characters like Freddy and Jason also glorify killers but I think there's a disconnect there where those characters are very obviously supernatural and fictional. Movies like The Strangers try to be realistic and there's something about making real thrill-killers or home invasion killers seem ""cool"" that disturbs me greatly. So I put it out there up front that this type of movie is not my cup of tea so take that into account when looking at my score. You may feel very differently than I do about these movies and, if so, you will likely enjoy this movie more than I did.",The Strangers

I dare not call it horror, as it is to horror as Twilight is to vampire films.Sure, we all are subject to experience terror like Kristen (Liv Tyler) and James (Scott Speedman), but, absent a few f*cks, this was just about as mild a film as you can get, and certainly only an ""R"" to the prudes on the ratings board.The fact that the lighting was insufficient really detracted from the experience. I know it is night, but you need to at least see the terror in the victim's eyes.The best part of the film is the very end.

24,zardoz-13,"""Friday the 13th"" Meets ""In Cold Blood""",8,3 June 2008,"Freshman writer & director Bryan Bertino's new horror movie ""The Strangers"" qualifies as an eerie, ominous, white-knuckled account of an after-dark home invasion. If you live deep in the woods where the plot unfolds, this nerve-racking, scream-inducing exercise in terror will make you think before you answer the front door at 4 AM. Horror fanatics that thrive on suspense, surprises, and blood-curdling chills in a plausible context will crave this gripping, low-budget, nail-biter. ""The Strangers"" is not a supernatural horror movie. Although ""The Strangers"" neither matches nor surpasses either Sam Peckinpah's violent classic ""Straw Dogs"" (1971) or Ruggero Deodato's horrific ""The House on the Edge of the Park"" (1980), both legendary home invasion epics that set the bar high for imitators, this Rogue Pictures Release has more than its share of virtues. Bertino uses silence to create suspense and alternates silence with the sudden appearances of the intruders in masks to build tension. Deep-fried gorehounds will complain about the shortage of blood and humor.""The Strangers"" opens with an anonymous ""Dragnet"" style narrator talking in a funereal tone. According to him, FBI statistics show one-point-four million violent crimes occur annually in America. He adds that intruders attacked both Kristen McKay and James Hoyt in their summer house at 1801 Clark Road, in South Carolina, on February 11, 2005. No such actual incident occurred, but the semi-documentary approach enhances the film's authenticity. Incredibly, Bertino lets the cat out of the bag at the beginning. Two Mormon boys on bikes in white shirts pedal up to 1801 Clark Road. They find a smashed up car in the driveway with its glass shattered and the house's front doors have been battered down. Abruptly, Bertino turns back the hands of time. Typically, this kind of anti-climactic strategy would blunt a movie's impact. Already, you know the outcome. Nevertheless, Bertino relies on our morbid curiositywe gawk at accidentsto draw us into the events of this unspeakable crime.Kristen (Liv Tyler of the ""Lord of the Rings"" movies) and her boyfriend James Hoyt (Scott Speedman of the ""Underworld"" movies) are guzzling champagne at a wedding reception. Sweeping her off her feet, he carries her outside where he proposes marriage. Kristen rejects James. They leave the wedding in his car. An oppressive silence isolates them from each other until they reach the summer house in the sticks that belongs to James' parents. Kristen finds rose petals scattered across the carpet leading to the bathtub. James confesses that his brother Mike (Glenn Howerton of ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"") and he spent the morning preparing this reception. Kristen explains that she isn't ready for marriage. Later, the ice thaws between them. Kristen and James start to make out. This amorous interlude comes to an abrupt halt when somebody bangs on the front door. They glance at the clock; it's four in the morning. At the door, they meet a wayward young woman. She inquires about somebody that neither Kristen nor James know. After a moment elapses, the girl vanishes into the night.Kristen asks about cigarettes and James drives off to buy them. While James is gone, the mysterious girl returns and hammers at the door. Kristen tries to ignore her. She finds a beer from the fridge. While she is musing about the evening's events, a man wearing a white flour sack turned inside out on his head appears in the background. Suddenly, Kristen spots him. She starts screaming. Our heroine locks herself inside a bedroom. She cowers there in fear with a steak knife in one bloody hand until James returns. He refuses to believe that anybody has broken into the house. James takes Kristen on a tour of the premises and shows her that they are alone. When James asks her about her cell phone, Kristen tells him that the intruders stole it. James checks his car and finds it in a shambles. He stares at a girl not far away wearing a Pin-Up Girl mask. Afterward, all Hell breaks loose.What sets Bertino apart from Peckinpah and Deodato is that he pares everything down to its bare essentials. We know very little about the killers. They wear ordinary masks, and Bertino never reveals their faces. All he wants us to know is they are random, cold-blooded killers. Basically, they want is to corner somebody at home somewhere that they can torture and kill. Neither Kristen nor James has done anything to deserve their tragic fate. They are in the wrong place at the right time for our homicidal maniacs. Bertino keeps the story short, simple, but far from sweet. Liv Tyler is a scream queen natural, and Bertino paces the film for maximum impact. The assailants have a way of being everywhere at once, and their encounters with Kristen are guaranteed to shock. Bertino loves to let the intruders emerge unbeknownst behind our heroes or to tackle them out of the blue like a football linebacker. Indeed, Bertino leaves out so much that your typical hack horror director would wallow in that ""The Strangers"" seems comparatively poetic in his down-to-earth authenticity. Altogether, ""The Strangers"" will hoist your hackles and keep them hoisted during its brisk but hallowing 85 minutes.",The Strangers
25,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Competently done,7,15 April 2010,"It is with fear as it is with humor; often the simpler and more subtly delivered it is, the greater the effect will be. This builds up atmosphere carefully, gradually and expertly. However, it seems as though that's as far as they thought about it. Once it has us right where it wants us, once we've given in, this stumbles around without anywhere to really go, ends up padding the latter half(not to mention pack it with the clichés of the genre) and coming to a conclusion both empty and forgettable. Jump-scares, ""no, don't go in *there*"", etc. They've worked before, so using such is a stand-by, instead of coming up with something new and original, and they're easy and cheap to use, so you're not risking anything. The events do not hold up to scrutiny if you expect it to be realistic; teleportation and other inexplicable occurrences prevent that. I personally find nothing as horrifying as that which can happen; perhaps it is a subconscious defense mechanism to steer clear of that. With that said, this is immensely creepy. If you're up for this, and you allow it to, this *will* make your skin crawl(it runs out of steam near the middle, and after that, is not as satisfying). The cinematography and editing are a major part of the reason for this; this is shot with hand-held/steadi-cams, every shot has motion, and this works perfectly. Also, the use of sound is immensely skillful. The isolation and solitude are impeccable, and largely without the negatives of such. This is rather well-acted, Tyler and Speedman are spot-on, and manage to carry this nicely. The dialog is natural, as are the relationships between the well-written, developed and largely psychologically credible characters. But better logic in their actions would be golden; too much of what they do is purely ""because the script says so"", and that includes the basis for the entire concept. This does deserve respect for how mysterious it dares to be, not explaining every single thing; we ""want"" to understand(the motive, what exactly happens, so on and so forth) because our brain is telling us that it will take away the anxiety, and we don't stop to realize that that's not(always) what we want. There is plenty of disturbing/intense content, a little bloody and somewhat gory violence and infrequent moderate to strong language in this. The DVD comes with two interesting deleted scenes totalling at 5 minutes, and a well-done, informative 9 minute featurette entitled The Element of Terror that holds spoilers. I recommend this to every fan of this kind of film. 7/10",The Strangers

27,view_and_review,They Made a Sequel!?,4,13 March 2018,"There is a movie in theaters now titled The Strangers: Prey at Night. When I saw the title it jogged my memory and I recalled a previous movie titled The Strangers. I looked it up, found it, streamed it on Amazon and ugh. This movie was so lame. What should've been over in 20 minutes was dragged on for an hour and a half.A couple goes to a ""cabin in the woods"" to spend the night. Once there they start getting terrorized by some masked ""strangers"". The masked sadists pretty much act like invading peeping toms the entire movie. They only had about five lines collectively (which I'm assuming was supposed to add to the creepiness--either that or there was a budget on words). What made the movie so incredibly lame was its predictability... well that and the slow-footing of the antagonists. How long can you drag on the hunting of two very normal and weak individuals? And I'm using the word ""hunting"" very liberally because it was like shooting fish in a barrel; the entire movie took place in one location. Yet, I had to endure an hour and a half of whimpering, screaming and playing hide-and-seek; the longest game of hide-and-seek in history. They didn't even take turns being hider and seeker those cheaters. All that brings me to the point of: I can't believe they made a part two!!!",The Strangers
28,neil-476,Really really irritating movie,3,3 September 2008,"I'm going to be a bit more spoiler-y than usual here. Reading the paper and/or watching the trailer means that you go in to this film knowing that it's about some people being menaced by strangers wearing masks. It starts off with titles telling you that it is based on real events (I don't always trust this after the Coens lied to us at the start of Fargo), complete with a redundant voice-over reading those titles word for word (and not very well either). These titles tell us that X and Y went back to Z after a wedding reception, where violent things took place and nobody knows quite what happened. To cement this, the opening sequence is two boys cycling by, only to go into the house and then make a hysterical phone call going on about all the blood.Point being we know from the start that this is not going to turn out well.We then go into an interminable opening sequence where the two main characters, played by Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman, return to this holiday home in the middle of nowhere. All is not well between them. We never find out exactly why, but we seem to take half my life to not find out. The audience was full of young couples, the target demographic I imagine, and by gum, there was some restlessness among the natives. The feeling of everyone wanting to shout ""Get on with it!"" was almost palpable.The rest of the film is building tension - which it does quite well - but without anything much actually happening. Liv Tyler's character is drippy and snivelly and she plays it so well that you hate her. Both of the beleaguered couple are late realising the peril they are in and fail to do any of the things which might help them but, instead, do things which are even more monumentally stupid than the things which characters in this kind of film normally do - the audience was saying, fairly frequently, ""Oh, that's completely stupid. He/she would never do that."" Finally, in the last few minutes, the masked strangers actually get round to slaughtering them - yes folks, they die, just like you knew they were going to after the first few minutes made it clear, sorry for the spoiler - and that's it. Oh, except for the replay of the sequence of the two lads discovering the mayhem and then, the final shot, the clearly dead Liv Tyler suddenly grabbing one of them and screaming like only someone who has been lying on the floor bleeding for hours can scream. That's right, like an air-raid siren. A complete cheat ending, stolen from Carrie, flying in the face of everything in the film up to that point, just to create a final shock moment.This film is one of the most irritating films I have seen for a long time, and I do not recommend it.",The Strangers
29,anaconda-40658,Great Premise Lousy Ending.,5,23 June 2015,"The Strangers (2008): Dir: Bryan Bertino / Cast: Scott Speedman, Liv Tyler, Gemma Ward, Glenn Howeton, Kip Weeks: Title can be a reference to the three masked intruders terrorizing a young couple, or it can be a reference to the couple themselves who land at this remote home after leaving an event. Director Bryan Bertino does a fantastic job at creating suspense but for all its worth, it contains villains whose masks contain more personality as well as two leads whose roles consist of leaving each other alone while one is terrorized. It may provide certain tension but when viewers are thinking of smarter methods of survival, then someone on screen isn't using their brain. It is also faulted with an ending that really makes one wonder why these gruesome attacks occurred to begin with. Scott Speedman and Liv Tyler give it all they got but the material leaves them making too many errors, which eventually results in their utter doom. The three masked killers speak nearly no dialogue and seem to have no reason for their actions. There is also one poor sap who shows up and is mistaken for one of the killers and his face is blown off with a shotgun. The villains are scary but come away with nothing more than a presence and no back story or explanation. The film is well made but pointless, but it would provide a great method of informing people what never to do when terrorized by morons. Score: 5 / 10",The Strangers
30,kannibalcorpsegrinder,Wholly underwhelming and problematic home invasion effort,4,6 October 2018,"After a disastrous night out, a young couple returning home to finish the night find themselves being hunted by a trio of strange, masked intruders intending to hurt them and must put their differences aside in order to turn back the assailants and get out of their house alive.For the most part, this was a pretty bland and wholly disappointing effort. The main obstacle that hinders this one is the same feature that usually affects the genre is so much character stupidity to further the plotline of the film. This one is predicated on everyone running into danger simply to get themselves into more danger, not just from failing to recognize anything is going on until it's too late but also by blatantly ignoring directions given to them just moments before, running out to investigate any possible noise around them which provides the perfect launching point for them to get ambushed and to do it all without any kind of weapon onhand despite several opportunities to have a weapon or self-defense of some sort with them to do so. The idea of taking a loaded, overpowering weapon they don't have a match for, placing yourself in a one-way in, one-way out location and let them come to you, which is exactly what happens here only to have it be over once they get interrupted from their plan the first time around or splitting up to go off on an ill-advised search for help contacting the outside by themselves without any kind of firepower for protection offers the kind of idea what's going on within here. On top of that, the film itself is incredibly dull with very little interesting action taking place. Since the first half is focused mainly on their disappointing return home recollecting what happened and trying to move on followed up by him actually leaving her alone for an extended period of time, the main focus of so many of these scenes is reliant on watching her wander through the house alone checking various electrical appliances and believing that someone's outside the house that it just takes forever to get going before the actual invasion starts. None of this is interesting or creepy in the slightest, and with so much outside building up to them actually getting into the house in the first place that is far longer than it really should for something this simple-minded to take place. Coupled with a weak ending and plenty of rather large questions left at the end of it all and this one really overrides the few minor positives it has. The central concept of this one is quite terrifying and the majority of the tactics presented here do become incredibly unnerving were they to be played out in real life. The tactics of keeping them imprisoned in the house and cut-off from the outside world are rather creepy which is where the relentlessness of their psychological ambushes work nicely to give this some tension the longer it rolls on. Still, that's mostly undone by the far more prominent flaws here.Rated R: Graphic Violence and Graphic Language.",The Strangers

32,gradyharp,"Noises Within, Noises Without",8,19 November 2008,"There are a few flaws in this otherwise successful film that is in fact as frightening as the trailer makes it out to be. Not being one for the constant barrage of thriller films (the 'Saw' Series, the endless vampire variations, 'I know what you did...', etc) this viewer hesitantly watched what could have been yet another exercise in blood and gore. But surprise! The story (based on a true incident in 2005 as outlined by an off camera narrator discussing the number of violent deaths in America each year before the film opens) is tight, credible, and deals more with the emotion of terror of the unknown than images of gore. Kudos to writer/director Bryan Bertino for finding the core of the macabre. And it is true! James Hoyt (Scott Speedman) is driving his girlfriend Kristen MacKay (Liv Tyler) to the isolated summer home in the woods that James and his best friend Mike (Glenn Howerton) had earlier decorated with rose petals, candles and champagne in preparation for what was supposed to be a celebration of a marriage proposal. Sadness prevails in the car as Kristen has turned James' proposal down. They quietly enter the decorated house, and almost immediately begin to hear sounds outside and a door knock by a young girl apparently looking for a person not living in this house. Kristen asks James to go out and get her cigarettes and the creepy action begins. Three strangers each in masks terrify Kristen with noises, secretly entering the house, and creating a tense atmosphere until James returns. At this point the story becomes an almost unbearable sequence of events: it is clear the strangers are out to murder James and Kristen. Bound and beaten by the three strangers Kristen asks 'Why us? Why do you want to kill us?' and the simple answer from of the strangers is 'Because you're home'. The ending of the film could have been better handled by someone telling us the results of the night - the follow up to this true story. But instead Bertino elects to keep the level of terror high. Peter Sova (cinematographer) finds the right amount of shadow and dark to keep us guessing and the musical score by tomandandy is pitch perfect. This is a fine little film, but be prepared to jump in a few spots...and keep the lights on! Grady Harp",The Strangers
33,The_Void,Lacklustre and underwhelming horror,5,30 August 2008,"The Strangers is allegedly based on a true story; and if that true story is the filming of Funny Games, Ils and Vacancy; I might just believe it was. In all honesty, I don't know if the events depicted in this film actually happened; but clearly as a movie, it's just cashing in on the success of the aforementioned films as this one really has very little in the way of new material to offer. The film is very small scale and simply focuses on one couple, with the house they are staying in being the location for most of the action. The central theme is the idea of a menacing group of strangers invading a person's personal space. We focus on James Hoyt and Kristen McKay; a couple staying at his father's extravagant house in the country. He's just had his marriage proposal turned down and as such relations between them are not too good. Things get worse for the man and his lady when a young girl comes to their door and begins acting strangely. From there the couple begin getting terrorised by a group of strange people, intent on scaring them for no reason.To the film's credit, it does have some good moments. There's some good tension built up in the early stages of the film and things such as the way the attackers bang on the front door is creepy and effective. But the film doesn't really seem to know what it wants to be and the central premise is left at being just that (a premise) as The Strangers has absolutely no point to it at all. It's clear that the scriptwriter was beginning to run out of ideas by the time gets into the second half and the story just simply stops progressing. Granted, there's only so much you can do with the idea of two people being terrorised and the film doesn't add anything to that. Liv Tyler looks like she'd rather be somewhere else throughout the film and delivers a totally unconvincing performance alongside Scott Speedman who has very little to do. I started to get really bored long before the end and the ending did little to wake me up; the film does feature a brutal ending but the film unfortunately has already made it nigh on impossible to care by that point. Overall, this is an unconvincing film that falls way short of the interesting mark and therefore is not worth catching.",The Strangers

Guess it must be the masks that scares a lot of people. It is so-called based on a true event but at the end it is never explained what should have happened if it was based on true events. The killers their faces are never shown and it is never clear why they did it and who they are. In fact, nothing is ever explained, who is Tamara? I compared it a bit with 'Vacancy' and that kind of flicks. It's purely based on fright and scary moments.

What make this movie scary is lack of motive for the perpetrators. The 911 call sounds way too real. I bet if the occupants of the house were 3 Marines back from Iraq this would never happened. The part I do not understand is why the bad guys were not shot or ran over. Oh well it's just a movie, but a scary one. 8 out of 10 on the fear meter.

36,DICK STEEL,A Nutshell Review: The Strangers,7,5 July 2008,"So when Underworld co-star Kate Beckinsale got to make a horror/thriller with Vacancy while waiting for the green light on a possible Underworld pre/sequel, Scott Speedman too had to do something equivalent, and so got himself signed up with The Strangers, written and directed by Bryan Bertino, which takes a fictional look at what it purports to be based on true events with regards to the senseless acts of violence committed against James Hoyt (Speedman) and Kristen McKay (Liv Tyler).Whether it be real or not, it takes its time to tell you that more than 1.4 million violent crimes happen on average in the USA, which of course works out to be... hell a lot. And it puts this at the back of your mind that it could happen to just about anyone, which after watching the movie, you'd more or less agree, given its less than sophisticated means of attack. Ss with all horror movies coming out of Tinseltown these days, it's the usual in-your-face slasher flicks / torture porn that get made, going one up against each other through being creative with weapons, blood and gore. Here it kept things simple, using common household tools against you.It's a movie without a lot of dialog between the characters, given that the assailants do not speak with one another, or lapse into the usual monologue with their victims. They do what they need to do quickly when the time calls for it, otherwise their theatrics allow the filmmakers to max out the surround sound system in the theatre with plenty of running about, throwing of stuff against doors/windows, together with testing out their light and shadow play thoroughly. And technically, you've got to tip your hat towards its flawless execution (pardon the pun).The backstory to the characters of Kristen and James show us that while they are a loving couple, James' premature proposal to Kristen, and her rejection, put them in an awkward situation where he had plenty of yes-I-do aftermath activities planned out, such as a night at his parent's summer home, and a road trip thereafter, all thrown into disarray. They still reach that home away from home, but are not really communicating with each other. And with observed weakness comes opportunity for the perpetrators to complete their surveillance, and launch their systematic attack.Which for the first hour, it almost became the Liv Tyler show, as she single-handedly holds your attention with her frantic looks and powerful lungs, while trying to wish it all away as a bad dream. Bryan Bertino succeeds in driving through the tension and fear of having unknown strangers in an unfamiliar home, and at 4am in the morning with their constant knocking and mischievous, deadly pranks, can really take its toil on you. There are loopholes of course in this story, such as failure to hold ground, and to never, ever split up, but I guess these folks never learn from the many horror movies that preceded it.So when it went into its final 20 odd minutes, you can sense a feeling of dread, both for the characters, and the rather repetitive run-hide-seek continuum. Like Michael Haneke's Funny Games, there never is a rationale shared with the audience even though they continuously dish out violence, and while Haneke's villains were rather chatty, the ones here never bother to talk any more than they should, and coupled with their childish masks, make them a bit more terrifying when they come out of the dark.Not a masterpiece, and surely less intellectual than Funny Games, but definitely has its moments, and managed to send some chills down unsuspecting spines, like that row of punks sitting on the same row as me and actually squirmed at their seats.",The Strangers

Now we have two good actors, Scott Speedman and Liv Tyler, but their characters lacked any good development and not to mention, if you're alone in your house and someone's making noise outside, do you walk towards the noise?! I'm sorry, just had to get that out, it just frustrated me in the classic cliché', let's split up and not give each other equal weapons.Kristen and James are a couple who have gone back to their father's place to celebrate the engagement that they were supposed to have, but Kristen said no. James feeling hurt goes out to get cigarettes for Kristen, Kristen hears some strange noises throughout the house, then discovers there is a man with a mask who is just making all sorts of bangs, breaking into the house, and destroying her phone. James comes back, they then discover there is three of these psycho's and must try to survive the night of terror that awaits them.The main problem with the movie is the major cliché's that come with it: the splitting up, the moving towards the noises, not to mention if these killers are human how is it that they appear in one scene then we cut back again to them and they're gone? I was just also disappointed with the dialog that did exist, ""because you were home""? Are you serious? There were some predictable moments, and the one thing that majorly made me angry, the killers took their very very very sweet time in establishing that they were any harm to these people, I mean other than with the car scene and making noises, I didn't take most of their presence seriously, I was like ""are they going to do anything this time?"". The Strangers is a disappointment, I would recommend you wait for the rental and watch it in the dark at home, it'd probably be scarier that way.5/10",The Strangers

40,sddavis63,Surprisingly Effective For A Movie That Lacks A Lot,8,10 February 2010,"There's a lot that this movie doesn't have. It has no real story to speak of; it has no real character development; it has no particular explanation of what's happening or why; it has no identification of who was responsible for what happened. Unfortunately, it's also based on a lie - the opening statement that this is one of those proverbial ""based on true events"" movies is even less true than usual. In fact, here it's apparently not true at all. There were no such people as Kristen McKay and James Hoyt, which makes the closing of the narration rather silly when it says that no one knows what actually happened - apparently not since nothing actually happened, although the Manson murders apparently ""inspired"" the story. The movie also has surprisingly little dialogue between the main characters or the killers. However - and this is a big however - what this does have is a lot of suspense and a lot of creepiness, to the point where it actually gave me the shivers a few times, which doesn't often happen.The ""story"" - such as it is - revolves around a young couple who return to his parents' home after a wedding reception and find themselves inexplicably the targets of a gang of masked thugs. Starting out as just a bizarre encounter with a young woman who appears at their door in the middle of the night, the movie does get progressively suspenseful, frightening, violent and bloody as the couple are hunted down, and the final scene is definitely one that makes you jump! So, in all fairness, director Bryan Bertino did a good job of building this. For all that it lacks - and it lacks a lot, as I've noted - as a suspense/thriller this really does work very well. 8/10",The Strangers

I don't even care if it doesn't have a lock on it. THAT WOULD BE YOUR FIRST INSTINCT.I'm totally getting ahead of myself and back to my original point: If you enjoy watching people make such blatant and moronic decisions, this is the home invasion thriller for you.The movie is literally a 15-minute suspense YouTube Purge Prequel bloated more than five times its welcome. A sad couple gets terrorized by three masked nobodies. Annnnd, that's the entire synopsis. I remember seeing this only one other time when it first came out ten years ago. As much as I heard good things, as much as this is my type of horror and as much as I wanted to like it, I hated it. I recall giving it 1½ stars out of five. With the inevitable sequel finally coming out a decade later, and premiering this weekend, I felt I might be wrong in my first impression. Well, yeah, I was wrong. Just now, not back then.Oh, and ""inspired by true events?"" Seriously? So Jaws was as well since sharks have occasionally snacked on humans? I should write my own screenplay ""inspired by true events"" and when pressed, I would argue there were people in my fictional town and many places have actual towns with people living in them.And don't get me started on the too-young-to-be-Mormon-bicyclists, yet still creepy Christian boys' reaction to the carnage in both the beginning and end. Aside from the 999th predictable jump scare (oh, movie, you were so close to an even thousand - if only you were a normal movie's length,) the boys' ""I've read about worse in the Bible"" unemotional blank stares to a gruesome bloodbath makes for some incredible unintentional laughter. It was just so hard trying to sympathize with such idiots. Um, the couple, not the boys. They were probably rejects from A.I.'s robot kid factory. Never once did I root for them. I just wanted the Strangers to literally sit down on the couch for the majority of the film while our ""heroes/victims"" did everything in their power to reverse living. Now, THAT, would've been a more interesting film.***Final thoughts: So, I brought this movie up to a coworker/fellow horror fan at work today and she said she didn't like these types of movie because they could really happen. Further, she explained she liked ghost stories more. I told her that's exactly why I love these; since they could happen, that's what scares me. Ghosts don't exist, so the movies about them never frighten me. She went on to say she also doesn't believe in ghosts, so those movies that couldn't happen scare her more.Funny.

what i mean by the story having no substance is that nothing really happened. there wasn't any real back and forth between the couple and the strangers, the entire movie was run and hide. and while i kind of like that the strangers won at the end, it kind of made it all feel pointless, like i just watched an gore flick without much gore. also why the hell would they leave her alive?",The Strangers
44,Robert_duder,A hidden gem among summer blockbusters that'll scare the heat right out of you,8,10 June 2008,"There isn't a lot...if any...scary movies in the theater right now. It might not seem like the ideal time to release a twisted slasher horror film but the makers of The Strangers did it anyways. I can't help but be completely impressed by newcomer director and writer Bryan Bertino because his story and sense of suspense and horror is remarkable. I kept comparing his style in this film to that of film maker Alexandre Aja (The Hills have Eyes remake and High Tension) both remarkably gritty, gory and disturbing horror films and they moved for blood, gore but still a solid story and high suspense and The Strangers definitely aims for that level. Nearly the entire film happens in and around a summer home in the dark of night and you are riveted by each scene. The cast is weak unfortunately which means the story has to be really strong and it is!! The brilliance of The Strangers is that you could close your eyes and listen to this film and be just as, if not more, terrified. Bertino uses such an array of audio stimulus to create this terrifying situation. Loud banging, windows breaking, shots firing, feet running, turntable playing, finger nails and screams are all so profound that it gets to your very senses!! Liv Tyler is the scream queen and she has moments in the film but for the most part she comes across as very dry and emotionless. She eventually has several emotional breakdowns but her performance and character still seems very empty and robotic. You almost wonder if it's on purpose but I can't think of why that would be. Scott Speedman is her boyfriend and he too behaves rather robotic and never really shows any great acting chops. It is very fortunate for the both of them that the story and suspense is strong. Still somehow they work for their roles. Kip Weeks, Gemma Ward and Laura Margolis are the killers in question and they do a good job considering their job is to look ominous and never really even show any emotion all of them being masked 99% of the film.Essentially there is only two characters in the film being Tyler and Speedman's characters plus the killers. But this film is all about the aura of suspense. Right from the beginning you feel the isolation and the darkness, the entire mood of the film is something down and disturbing and yet the film starts very slowly and then when the terrifying moment comes it freaks you out even more. I think nearly the entire positives about this film has to be laid onto Bryan Bertino who is obviously a fan of the genre and he knows what it takes to get under your skin. This is the type of psychological thriller that made The Ring, Ringu, and the aforementioned Hills Have Eyes remake so disturbing. I think The Strangers will be the film that is remade in 20 years but people will say is not as good as the original. It's the type of film to survive time and become a cult classic. It crawled under my skin and if you're looking for a good scare in the hot summer...this could be it for sure!! 8.5 out of 10",The Strangers
45,wellthatswhatithinkanyway,No plot for love nor money but great if you're in the mood for a good scare,7,31 January 2009,"*mild suggestive spoilers*STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningHere's where I usually describe the plot of a movie, but The Strangers has no discernible plot to speak of. It's really as simple as this: a young, apparently married, couple (Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman) find themselves trapped in their home by three masked strangers into making lots of loud bangs and spooking them out by getting right in their faces with their hideous masks. At barely seventy five minutes long, the lack of plot can be forgiven, instead compensated by getting down to business in the scaring people department. The masks are really scary and the frequent loud bangs/jump scenes the movie incorporates with them may not make it ideal for anyone with a heart condition but will satisfy those seeking some jumps and jolts. The tension is also built up nicely with a creepy use of eerie tracks played on vinyl records that build up to the scary moments. The end impression you get is one of going right over your head, but it was a good ride while it lasted, as the three goons make off, their mission completed in Bible belt America. And it's all apparently based on a true story, too. ***",The Strangers
46,bowmanblue,Strangers in the night,6,19 April 2015,"When you watch a film and you see the protagonist's life is in danger, one of the questions you probably ask yourself is 'What would I do in that situation?' In horror films it happens more than most.The Strangers is about three unknown people who mercilessly stalk a young couple at their home in the early hours of the morning. So, when we watch it, we picture our own home - how would we defend it? What random blunt objects could be turned into makeshift weapons to fight back with? And, of course, how would we escape? In The Strangers, the answers would probably - get gun and walk out of the dangerous situation. Sadly, neither man or woman involved ever considers this. Okay, from time to time, one of them might do something we would try - the idea of hiding in a room and pointing the gun at the only way in is a decent enough suggestion. However, that quickly gets abandoned due to a convenient plot device.This review is based on my second viewing of The Strangers. I quickly forgot it after the first viewing, but I like Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman, plus I like horror movies, so I thought I'd give it another go. The second time I turned it off just before the hour mark. It was getting too annoying.On the plus side, there are some bits that make you jump in the first third and the violence in the last act will satisfy the more bloodthirsty among us (I remember that from my first viewing - I never got to it second time round).It's an okay film, but the baddies SHOULD be overcome easier than the central characters seem to bother with.",The Strangers
47,ThomasDrufke,Terrifying Randomness,7,18 October 2018,"The thing I love about this movie is the incredibly creepy atmosphere and endless tension felt throughout. The idea of random crime/horror is not something explored in movies enough, and I think we always wish there were answers to every question we have. It's in our core that we want to know why things are the way they are, but sometimes ambiguity can enhance the filmgoing experience. It certainly does with The Strangers. Heck, the simple knock on the door or a random object slightly moved in your house can make for a creepy experience, and I loved the way this movie tackled that. What I don't think the film did strongly was its script and characters, talk about a cliched romantic relationship with Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman. They are serviceable as performances, but the characters are far from developed or all that likable. But if you put yourself in their shoes while this mess is happening, then you have a story to grapple onto. It has some dated elements but there are some scenes that are about as terrifying as a 2000's film can provide you.7.9/10",The Strangers

James and Kristen are a couple whom just arrived at their isolated home late at night. A girl knocks on the door looking for someone. She leaves, and James leaves to go buy cigarettes. While away, the girl comes back and the terrorizing begins. The masked strangers play psychological games. They continue knocking on the door and are already in the house. They take Kristen's cell phone but stay out of her sight. James makes it back and the terrorizing escalates. Soon, they realize these people are going to do more than just play games. Up till this point, I thought the movie was really good. But then all the strangers do is the same old thing. Make noises, write words on things, all the while staying out of view. And there was no surprise ending.FINAL VERDICT: Good in the beginning but it runs out of material. Still if you like films with a good chase, then I recommend it.",The Strangers

The two awkwardly stay at an isolated vacation house. James can't take it, and calls his friend to pick him up in the morning. They receive peculiar knocks on the door by a creepy woman, but James shrugs it off. Kristen runs out of cigarettes, so James goes to get her some more. Kristen gets bombarded by knocks and an intrusion by some mysterious invaders that are wearing masks. James returns home to try and protect Kristen, but they start becoming overwhelmed by their sick games. This movie is supposedly based on a true story. For the rather weak story, I felt they did an excellent job of cramming it with constant suspense. That's one thing I have to give this movie credit for. The story isn't all that great, but it manages to scare you. The story is simple and does manage to pull of what it sets out to do well. We are actually able to feel for the two leads, thanks to director & writer Bryan Bertino. We get a decent background on them. Both of them are in disarray and crushed, thanks to Speedman's proposal gone wrong. Some might find it hard to get into both of them, but I dug it. The attackers themselves are frightening. We don't know much about them, and I didn't want too. We are given no reason as to why they are doing what they are. The fact that they had no ulterior motives for commencing these assaults scared the wits out of me. I've always found murders that have no motives for killing people to be that much scarier. You don't see their faces at all. They take off their masks at one point, but you don't get a clear glimpse of them. I also liked Bertino's added touches, such as keeping the viewer on edge with random knocks on the door, progressively getting louder with each knock, or a record skipping constantly. He knows how to trigger emotions out of people. The story won't resonate with anyone, but you'll feel very uncomfortable, and you don't get much of a chance to breathe. Liv Tyler is one of my favorites. She is excellent as the vulnerable heroine. There is nothing heroic about her, and I wanted to jump in the screen and help her. Not only is she drop dead gorgeous, but one hell of an actress. Scott Speedman is not a favorite of mine, but he was pretty good. He was sympathetic, likable, and I felt for his predicament. He had good chemistry with Tyler as well. I thought the ending was a bit of a cop out. It sets up for an obvious sequel, which has yet to commence, but it does provide one frightening boo scare. I didn't expect it, and I jumped. Final Thoughts: This relies on non-stop suspense and grim mood. It does both of those things to perfection. As a big horror movie fan, I did enjoy this movie. It knows its audience, and focuses on it's strengths. It won't set your world on fire, but it will give you the willies7/10",The Strangers

52,sol-,Knock Knock,6,4 October 2017,"Supposedly based on an actual home invasion case, this horror-thriller involves a couple taunted and terrorised by three masked strangers late at night. The film begins very well with merely the sound of knocking on their wooden front door adding lots of chills; the orange colour scheme is also quite spooky and unsettling. There are additionally many effective audience jolts where things very suddenly and unexpectedly happen with a lot of terror to be had from the notion of not feeling safe in one's own home. As the film progresses though, it becomes abundantly clear that the filmmakers have no intent in exploring the motives of the home invaders, and while this may well seem appropriate (given than in the actual case the motive was a mystery too), the lack of motive renders the story rather hollow and extremely repetitive. The film's choice to saddle the protagonists with a deep background also seems unwise given how little bearing it has on the plot. Yes, they are experiencing relationship tensions but knowing this only renders the film a too obvious parable for the ability of adversity to bring people closer together. In short, 'The Strangers' is a terrifying film at its best and atmospheric to boot, but once it is over, it is hard to nut out exactly what the point of it all was - though that understandably might perplex some viewers less than others.",The Strangers
53,Rodrigo_Amaro,This Is NOT a Horror Movie. It's Just a Simple Thriller With Nothing Exceptional,5,5 July 2010,"First let me get this straight and pay attention to the differences and similarities between the following movies I'm gonna quote: ""Poltergeist"" is a horror movie; and ""Fallen"" (1998) is a thriller movie. Again: ""Frankenstein"" is a horror movie; and ""Se7en"" is a thriller. My concept follows this: almost everything that goes on supernatural or monsters topics are horror movies (and they supposed to have some horrific or gore moments which means they thrill you); thriller/suspense the name explain by itself but there are cases that a movie can be mixed with both. A notorious example is ""Cannibal Holocaust"" where the horror came from the Indians and filmmakers, real people shocking each other with their acts, something that might be more suitable to happen in real life than ""Dracula"" for instance.Finally we get to ""The Strangers"" and why I think people went in wrong way saying that this is a horror film. It's not! It has some few elements of a horror film but if you are a good moviegoer you're gonna notice the difference. Once upon a time a trouble young couple (Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman) who wanted to relax after a busy night party. They went to a house close to nowhere and all of sudden three people in masks starts to make some deadly threats and this couple starts to get very scarred with that. Their cell phones are dead (I'm not sure about the phones in the house but it looks like they didn't have one); the car is wrecked; they only got each other and no one else. Why this is happening? We're never gonna find out! This couple makes some odd choices in trying to protect themselves, looks like they are the sons of one of the four guys in ""Deliverance"" but instead of making good choices to protect themselves, like the group of friends did, they're gonna do some dumb moves (that includes crying and shouting all the time and shooting a friend on the face while they were trying to hide themselves). Are there any creatures in this? NO! Although in some moments the masked trio appears and reappears out of the blue. So what's the point of this movie? Nowhere! To make the story even more shorter here comes the summary of the summary: A young couple went to a house, started to receive some strange death threats and the reason why this happened was just because they were in the house. That's it! It's not all that bad. I mean the cinematography works brilliantly, the director created lots of tension in the first hour but after that everything that Liv Tyler does with the screaming and running around the house or outside of it just made the movie slower and slower, and the tension is just like vapor, it disappears easily, only to return at the end, and to disappear again when it ends in that sordid way.Major problem with this film: a good screenplay. No memorable quotes, no good lines, not even some bad funny lines, it demanded too much of the audience and the writers expected that we as audience took it seriously just because this story was based on a true story. And in the end it was just like a mass murder: Pointless, without reasons but less shocking. Sometimes life has some of this things, we see crimes like that many times and that's why this movie hasn't nothing exceptional to show. And that's why you shouldn't call this a horror movie. Director Bryan Bertino cut the explanations of the masked people and why they were doing that to the couple to make them more mysteriously. Well, that works but no matter what happens I wanted a answer and most audiences also want a answer because they don't want to pass an hour and half of tension to come to an ending that leaves them to nowhere.I'm well versed in movies and I saw a lot of it without any answers and sometimes they're good because of that, they leave you wondering and thinking about the story. This is not the case. They tried to be just like Spielberg's ""Duel"" and they failed. If you never watched ""Duel"" you must see it. In that Dennis Weaver is persecuted by a crazy and killer truck driver (we're never able to see his face in the entire movie) after passes him and leaving him behind because he was moving too slow on the road. That movie was brilliant, breathtaking and the tension works all of the time. Once again ""The Strangers"" is just a thriller with nothing to add. 5/10",The Strangers
54,Thanos_Alfie,Interesting...,6,29 January 2019,"""The Strangers"" is a Thriller - Horror movie in which we watch a couple staying in an isolated vacation house after returning from a wedding reception. During midnight they receive a knock on their door from some strangers and soon they find themselves in a very weird and unexpected situation since the strangers whose faces are hidden with masks invade their vacation house.I liked this movie because it was very interesting and even scary at some points. I enjoyed the fact that the faces of the strangers were covered with masks, something that made them look even scarier. The direction which was made by Bryan Bertino was very good and with many surprises and some plot twists that I didn't expect. At this point it has to be mentioned that the movie wasn't based on true events but inspired, it's completely different. Regarding the interpretations, I have to admit that I liked the interpretation of Scott Speedman who played as James Hoyt and Liv Tyler who played as Kristen McKay. Another interpretation that I enjoyed was Gemma Ward's who played as Dollface.Finally, I have to say that ""The Strangers"" is a nice horror movie, with some very good and scary scenes and with some good interpretations made by its cast too. If you are a fan of horror movies and you have already watched and liked some other horror movies like ""Vacancy"", ""The Last House on the Left"", ""Eden Lake"" then you definitely have to watch this movie too because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it.",The Strangers
55,zkonedog,"True Events Are Scary, But Film Adaptation Falls A Bit Flat",5,11 March 2017,"I think that the ""scariness"" factor of this film is the fact that its events were based on a true life scenario. While coming home late from a party one night, a man and his fiancée are terrorized by three people wearing various masks.That scenario, I will admit, is pretty spooky...the idea that someone is stalking you within your own home is truly horrifying. However, in film format, the story falls a bit flat for two reasons:First off, there really aren't any big ""jump moments"" (at least ones that aren't given away in the trailer) for all the suspense that is generated. Time after time, the tension builds and then just fades away. I think that a truly good horror movie needs to really deliver on those jump scenes (even though our heart rates increase, we really do want to be scared), otherwise the audience will no longer be on the edge of their seat, which is exactly what happened to me towards the end of the film.Secondly, there is no resolution to the film. I guess a sequel is currently in the works, so perhaps that will explain why the masked tormentors are picking on two specific individuals, but in the context of this film, the acts are completely random. I think that was supposed to be part of this film's appeal, but it did not leave me with a good impression of the overall movie upon its conclusion.So, if you are one of those people who can completely immerse yourself in the action of the film, you will find this movie more compelling than I did.

So, we already know the story and we even know how it will probably end. Worse: the film basically consists of pure harassment, there is no story. Its a couple running in a house, fearing for their life, period. This would work on a short film but not on a one-and-a-half hour movie. It simply tires us through too much tension and suspense with nothing to which it can support itself. Bryan Bertino signs the film, being his first work as director. Of course, a newbie, a freshman wanting to show himself and show talent that he does not have yet. The film makes abundant use of sound effects to suspense, but some of them are so cliché that they end up making the film even more predictable. Liv Tyler is the only actress I've ever seen in other works (""Armageddon"", ""Lord of the Rings""), and although I see her talent, I do not think this movie would be the right fit for her to shine. It was a mistake for her to accept the role because she never adapted herself to the character or the film. The rest of the cast virtually does not stand out. Despite all this, its a film that can be watchable one time or another, when we have forgotten enough of it.",The Strangers
58,TheMovieDiorama,The Strangers survives on realistic terror but fails to create any emotional depth.,5,25 February 2018,"I was so looking forward to watching this again, it had been years. I remember this being superbly scary. Now, this really didn't affect me and found it had too many flaws for it to be classed as a good horror film. It's inspired by the true events of a couple returning to their summer house and being terrorised but three masked strangers. That's literally all this is. There is no reasoning for targeting this couple in the first place other than ""because you were home"". It just lacked certainty and reasoning. I know that's the point of this film, a random attack where the film depicts only the events of the night. This is a fictionalised story based on true events, it would not have hurt to have some backstory on both the couple and the strangers just to add that much required layer of interest. I appreciated the realism, I liked the small environment and I loved the concept of tormenting your victims before actually ending their lives (I'm sane, honest!). However, when the characters have the emotion depth of a lamp post, it means nothing. I didn't care for their fates at all. Liv Tyler was extremely weak in this, her scared acting skills were unbelievably dull. Scream all you want, doesn't make you a good actress. Scott Speedman was fine I guess. The physical presence of the strangers were menacing and I found many of the jump scares were effective, even if they were just loud noises. Suspense and tension were maintained throughout, probably because I had to turn up the damn volume as the voice track was so flipping quiet! What was that about!? Had to turn up the sound bar to 36! That's madness. For all it's technical excellence in the horror genre, The Strangers lacks that connection which makes us invested into the film. Oh and that ending, really? You're going to conclude on a jump scare? I don't care anymore.",The Strangers
59,jzappa,Lazy Exploitation Junk On Auto-Pilot,6,22 September 2008,"Bertino had been toiling at the bottom of the food chain as a grip on a microbudgeted flick when he pitched this screenplay to Rogue Pictures and after that was invited to direct it. He gave a friend his grip gear and supposed he was never going to need them again. He said in an interview: ""I still had to buy books on how to direct.""He begins on a murky black night in an area of empty summer homes. Scott Speedman has proposed to Liv Tyler, but she isn't ready. Bertino concentrates on a 33-rpm turntable.I am absorbed by the expository questions in which the film wisely starts to get lost. Then there is a knock at the door. They open the door and find a young girl. They tell her she has the wrong house. She goes and stands in the yard. And then, all night long, their sense of security is undercut by more knocks, breaking glass, scraping, smashing. Bertino tries to make the soundtrack the third character.I don't think it is all that safe to say that this movie is inspired by true events. It's inspired by other movies, like the dregs of the 1970s and '80s slasher genre material in general. That is, save for the pseudostylistic anti-directing that brings about the shaky hand-held camera-work that permeates the movie. (I will however admit that the lighting as well as some of the staging is effective.) The woman in distress, Tyler, is told by the action-taking man, Speedman, to ""stay here."" And at that, having followed its decent undertaking at a suspenseful turning point, Bertino decides to shift into auto-pilot and take a nap. As a result, every cliché in the book is employed. Tyler does not stay behind, duh, and as she evades the ominous title characters, she doesn't get any further than a few feet before falling down, after which she reveals to have peculiarly weak ankles, for she cannot walk but crawl and stumble. Later, when she seems to have gotten over her unfounded wound, she again faces attack, but suddenly she begins staggering and limping again.Tyler's main motivation once the intruders pose a clear threat to their security is to reach The Vintage Radio In the Shed to communicate help. Aside from her hackneyed addition to the film, the movie opens with the inside of a wrecked house, with cracks and breaks in the walls and doors, a blood-spattered knife lying on a table, and blood spread from corner to corner. A frenzied 911 call plays over the soundtrack as two young boys go into the house through the open front door. Then the Narrative Shifts Back To When It All Began.Everything within the movie's trite framework is simply convenient. Speedman leaves conveniently to buy cigarettes as Tyler stays home, a Damsel In Distress, bearing the boding beginning of the terror. Speedman arrives home a few minutes later. He is Skeptical of Her Story Until, yaddah yaddah yaddah.The film's opening disclaimer disclaims that what we are about to see is inspired by true events. Then there is a statistic, a date and an extremely brief and cryptic description of the two main characters' experience. Then it says, ""The brutal events that took place there are still not entirely known."" After seeing the film, one only wonders, If the brutal events that took place there are still not entirely known, then why are you making a movie about it? Seriously, there is nothing new about these ""brutal events"" that haven't been portrayed on screen before. What I am interested in is the probing of what is yet to be entirely known. What has basically happened here is the exploitation of the true events of ruthless, meaningless sadism endured by a random couple who are in love and struggling to start a life together.And it works. I normally do not see horror movies at a theater at night or even in the evening, because I have always been overwhelmed by an obnoxiously loud audience full of dates who have only gone there to have something interesting to distract them occasionally while they flirt and cuddle, scores of black stereotypes, and incongruous remaining moviegoers. Talking at an inconsiderate volume, crunching popcorn and rustling wrappers and paper bags as if there is no one else in the theater with them, and worst of all, a collective yelp of reactions to any moment of violence or sudden movement. However, the outing was a situation beyond my control this time around, and I realized during the movie that I was experiencing a purely American cultural tradition. Everything I just mentioned is all a part of the movie to these filmgoers. We are fascinated with violence, preferably with no substantial story attached to it because every function of story is turned on its head. They want these people to die because they did not come to see their heroes and heroines prevail; they came to see a shameless display of gore and violence. And the vocalizations of their satisfactions throughout make it communal, social.And, as one expects, and as is the sole reason why a) Bertino suddenly found a studio directing career had in no time fallen in his lap, b) the definitively pointless script was written in the first place and c) why convention could be argued as a necessity in studio slasher pictures, The Strangers in the U.S. alone exceeded industry estimates and made its $9 million budget back twice. For the rest of us, though, who want to endure truly horrific drama rather than a simple, forgettable gratification of an interest in gore and violence, The Strangers is a waste of a decent first act and a holder of a frustrating, primitively satisfying, totally anti- climactic ending.",The Strangers
60,Captain_Couth,I am very disappointed,1,7 March 2009,"The Strangers (2008) is a very disappointing movie. I was expecting a good movie with a few genuine scares and such. I was very unpleased and not very happy by the time the movie was over. All I got was the same old, old. A retread thriller filled with the usual clichés and a lot of cheap scares. I am not a fan of this movie, not at all. I wonder just how ""real"" the story this film was ""inspired"" by. Liv Tyler has not improved much over the years as an actress, the direction was ""paint-by-the-number"" and the characters were not likable at all.

Home invasion movies have been around since at least the early 70's and are still being churned out now, this one has nothing new to add. Apart from perhaps the creepy masks and the fact that this was made several years before The Purge. In it's favour it does have a few effective moments of terror plus Liv Taylor. But what I hated about this film most was it's awful shakey camerawork, it's all over the place, had the guy behind the lens been drinking??

Victims at their sight, in death forever It turned out so right, For ""The Strangers"" in the night. (End of song)Without unmasking too much of the terror thriller ""The Strangers"", the aforementioned revised Sinatra classic (Yes, Frank is rolling in his grave as we speak) explains much of the suspenseful plot of the film. Scott Speedman and Liv Tyler play a young couple spending the night in an isolated vacation home. Not too far during their stay, they find themselves hounded by three frightening masked strangers. Director Bryan Bertino does an effective job in depicting how the little things turn out to be the most harrowing ones in horror flicks; in ""The Strangers"" case: it would be the thundering door knocks, the skipped record, and the paralyzed gazes. Speedman and Tyler do sleepwalk a bit with their performances, but Tyler does pass the scream test in the terror scenes. There is not much dialogue in ""The Strangers"" so it would be strange for me to critique its near non-existing screenplay. Strangely enough, I am recommending ""The Strangers"" as the scariest film of the year. **** Good",The Strangers
64,runamokprods,"Well made, but ultimately empty",7,25 January 2014,"I lie between those who see this as a masterpiece, and those who see it as en empty exercise in clichéd sadism. On the one side, the film is very well made and effective. The cinematography, the acting, the editing, the score and direction work together to create a lot of truly creepy uncomfortable suspense, without resorting to too much gore, especially in the film's first half. On the other hand, it lacks any thematic core (as opposed to, for example ""Territories"" a recent low budget horror film that also managed to raise questions about political prisoners and xenophobic paranoia). It also lacks any psychological insight although the first half hints that might be where the film is going. But these horrific intruders aren't ultimately reflections of the main characters inner lives, or a comment on their emotional struggles. They're just really generic, unexplained evil. The film does a good job of evoking a nightmare, but by not aiming higher misses the chance to be something more special than an effective scare machine.",The Strangers
65,MBunge,A very good scare let down by an anti-climactic ending,7,30 August 2010,"James Hoyt (Scott Speedman) and Kristin McKay (Liv Tyler) are a young couple in love. Or at least they used to be. Then James asked Kristin to marry him and she said ""no"". Now the two of them have gone out to James' family home in the woods for what was supposed to be a gloriously romantic weekend. Now it looks like it'll be an eternity of uncomfortable silence and misery.Then someone knocks on the door. It's a young woman who asks an enigmatic question and they walks away into the woods. That's the start of a genuinely frightening ordeal as that girl and two other people lay siege to the home. They cut off the phone, destroy James' car and take and ax to the front door. These quiet, murderous strangers are always just out of sight and just a few steps ahead of James and Kristin, playing with them like cats with wounded mice. The two lovers try to run. They try to hide. They try to fight. None of it works. As you watch the movie, you can feel death coming for someone. The only question iswho?The Strangers isn't so much a story as it is a horrible obstacle course that James and Kristin try to get through. Which means first and foremost, the film rises or falls on the performances of Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman. The plot is tight and well constructed and Kip Weeks, Gemma Ward and Laura Margolis as the masked strangers do some decent mime work with almost no dialog and their faces never seen. The setting is organically creepy and the camera-work is effective. But no matter how good everything else is, if you don't care about the two characters confronted by this awful threat, the movie would be nothing more than a wind-up toy. Fortunately for everyone, Tyler and Speedman deliver. There isn't an abundance of characterization given to Kristin and James, but Tyler is luminous and vulnerable without seeming weak while Speedman makes James into a living, breathing man and not some horror-movie hero.Now, the ending is a bit of a wet firecracker. It's not stupid, ridiculous or overblown, like a lot of horror movie endings. It is unsatisfying and atonal. It's as though writer/director Bryan Bertino tried for a conclusion of brutal, provocative realism and forgot he wasn't making a realistic film. The three strangers all demonstrate super-ninja powers that allow them to know things people couldn't know and do things people couldn't do. The way they behave may be more low key and restrained, but it's no closer to real life than the way Freddy Kruger acts in A Nightmare on Elm Street. The unrealism is handled very well and is woven seamlessly into a hypnotically scary tale, but then comes a weirdly abrupt and common finish that leaves you wondering ""It was all leading up to THAT?""The Strangers needed an ending that was bigger or more elaborate or more something to make it a great movie. Without that, it's still a very good film.",The Strangers

68,drownnnsoda,A Knock at Your Front Door Will Never Be the Same Again.,10,30 May 2008,"I had been anticipating to see ""The Strangers"" for over a year before its release. I got the chance to go to a midnight screening, and I can honestly say it is one of the scariest, if not the scariest, movie I have ever seen in the theater. The story centers on troubled couple Kristin McKay (Liv Tyler) and James Hoyt (Scott Speedman), who, after a wedding reception and an upsetting rejection, arrive at James' family country house late in the evening. Both upset and confused, the couple's current worries are thrown out the window when they receive a knock on the door and a strange girl asking for ""Tamara"". What ensues is a terrifying battle between the couple and three masked strangers invading their home, violently terrorizing them for no apparent reason.First-time writer/director Bryan Bertino proves himself with an impressive debut here, because I haven't seen such a well-done horror movie in a long, long time. ""The Strangers"" gets off to an interesting start that hooks the audience with an upsetting subplot between the lead characters, and then drags them along for the remainder of the film on a truly thrilling ride in which the 'strangers' start to toy with the couple in increasingly violent manners as the movie escalates to its climax. And wow, what I ride it is. What I admire so much about this movie is that it uses simple tactics to get under the audience's skin - a knock at the door, a skipping record on an old phonograph, writing on the windows, the clinging of wind chimes - oh, and a trio of ruthless masked psychopaths lurking around in the dark. The use of shadows, stillness, and especially sound, is effective here, and there are a handful of scenes that take place in this movie that I will probably never forget.This movie tries to take the ""based on a true story""-angle (complete with the ""what you are about to see is based on true events"" prologue, much in the fashion of 1970s horror cinema), and while it really appears to just be inspired by unrelated true stories, the events that take place do seem like something that could actually happen in the real world, which makes it unsettling nonetheless. During the first thirty or so minutes, the spooks are subtle and slow, and the suspense is so well-built it is nearly unbearable (the entire segment in which Tyler's character is at the house alone had me chewing my nails). As the film progresses, the scares become much more in-your-face, ""boo!""-type jolts, which are damn effective and well-executed, whilst a feeling of hopelessness grows as the strangers cut off the couple from any possible chance of getting help. The movie overall has a very '70s feel to it, which I loved. It is very patient and quiet for the majority of the time, and the camera-work is reminiscent of old school horror movies. There is also a handful of references to past horror classics such as ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and ""Halloween"" as well, which confirm the 1970s throwback status it has. Now, for the downfalls. I won't lie, there are a couple of clichés present, but luckily they don't ever get our protagonists into real trouble, so they are ultimately forgivable. There are about two or three moments that are predictable as well (particularly when James' friend Mike shows up at the house), but I was personally so impressed with everything else in the film that its shortcomings were overshadowed. The performances in the film were excellent here, which strengthened the already sturdy script and cinematography. Liv Tyler has a very calming sense about her, but she performs well in the intense situations, and gains plenty of sympathy from the audience. Scott Speedman plays her good-hearted boyfriend, and you also feel for him off the bat after his being rejected by the woman he loves. The two have a great chemistry that worked in favor of their characters and the general situation.As for the strangers themselves, all three actors here play them perfectly. They all have an eerie stillness about them, and hardly speak, but they really don't need to. Their body language tells enough as they hide in hallways, swing on swing sets, and lurk around the property. They are nihilistic, ruthless villains in nature, and the fact that they are human makes them all the more scarier. They give no reason as to why they are committing such violent acts, but they don't seem to care, and that is extremely unsettling. The film's conclusion is rather bold and tragic (albeit a tad anti-climactic), but I like the fact that it did what it did. It kept the core mystery of the film alive, and while some may be disappointed, I thought it was great. Sometimes leaving questions in your mind is more unsettling than giving all the answers, and the filmmakers were daring enough to do so.Overall, ""The Strangers"" is a patient, spooky, and insanely suspenseful thrill ride from beginning to end. I cannot remember ever being so frightened at the movie theater, and I was very impressed with this film. The suspense is solid, the acting is believable, and it maintains that constant uneasiness of someone watching you from the shadows. So far, the best horror movie of the year for sure, and quite possibly the best horror movie of the decade - I have to applaud all those involved, because they put together an extremely well-made movie. For any horror fans (or general audiences that want to be seriously scared), this is a must-see. I guarantee you will leave the movie theater with an uneasiness that will follow you out to your car, and quite possibly back to your house. You'll be hesitant to ever answer a knock at your door past dark. 10/10.",The Strangers
69,davispittman,Entertaining horror movie with good performances,7,14 April 2017,"The strangers is a fairly entertaining horror movie starring Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman. I liked the performances in the movie, Tyler and Speedman give pretty good performances. The movie isn't the most original scary movie in the world and it's not the scariest either, but it is fairly entertaining. The killers are scary looking with their masks and the way they act and talk is very eerie and creepy. It is true I guess that the film borrows some from more popular and more famous scary movies, but plenty of horror movies have to do that, there's kind of a limited amount of things they can do in these kind of films. Tyler and Speedman have good chemistry too, I liked them on screen together. Overall you can predict the happenings in this movie, not a whole lot is going to surprise you in this film, but like I said, you can still enjoy it a good bit as long as you're not looking for a 100% original nothing you've ever seen before kind of movie. 7/10 is fair for The Strangers.

70,rooprect,Here's why this is a great thriller,6,5 February 2010,"In a word: momentum.It begins with a very dark, cold setting. Liv has tears streaming down her cheeks, but no one says a word. Over the next few minutes we struggle to piece together the details of a young couple that's just had a nasty breakup. It's so powerfully done, you might forget that you're watching a ""slasher film"" and instead you're watching a drama about interpersonal relationships.Then things start to heat up with perhaps the scariest thing you can imagine in the middle of the night. Someone pounding at the front door. I'm sure you've been in that situation; instantly your heart picks up the pace. Is it the cops coming to drag you away? Is it an angry neighbour? Maybe a car wreck on the front lawn? This is the feeling which the film masterfully captures.Then menacing figures begin to appear. Again, it's all frighteningly believable. We're not talking about crazy Freddy Krueger stuff here; we're just slowly building terror whilst staying solidly in the realm of reality--and that's the key to scaring the socks off your audience's arse.I can't go much further without ruining the plot, but I'll just say it continues nicely. Perhaps it gets a little predictable with some of the horror clichés later on (which is why I took off a few points), but on the whole it remains consistent, lurching ahead one degree at a time into a nightmare.The payoff is, in my mind, brilliant. A lot of people are left unfulfilled, and I understand why. But to me, that's what leaves you feeling all the more chilly after the credits come up. It leaves enough 'unfulfillment' to make you feel like you could be next. And isn't that the point of scary movies? I haven't seen too many horror flicks in my lifetime, but I'm glad I happened upon this one. If you watch this film & enjoy it, I highly, HIGHLY, *HIGHLY* recommend ""Exorcist III"". Not only is that a great old school horror film, its artistic presentation and great acting (starring the great George C. Scott, no less) makes it one of my favourite films of all time. While ""The Strangers"" isn't quite in that league yet, it seizes upon the same classic vibe of slow, unstoppable terror in a realistic world. If more horror flicks were like this, I might start watching them again.",The Strangers

Probably something automatic, since the shotgun didn't help these folks much.There are a lot of criticisms of this movie pertaining to how realistic it is, how the characters react, and the pacing. For me, it worked, one hundred percent. The fear I felt in this movie was partially about imagining I was one of the victims and being afraid for my own safety. However, I think more than that, it is about being afraid that someone you care about will get hurt, and wanting to protect them. The story focuses on a couple who come home late one night to a remote vacation cottage after a wedding reception. During the night, they are disturbed by several people with masks whose motivations are clearly malicious. It is a simple set-up, but how it builds from there just worked really, really well for me. I see so many horror movies that have no effect on me that it is pretty special when something gets to me the way this did. I think it's about escapism--I was totally able to place myself in the story, whereas many horror movies, or even movies in general, are so removed from reality that it's hard to care. I know there will be those who disagree and find this movie as cartoonish as the next low-budget slasher. Well, I'm glad for the experience The Strangers gave me. I felt about as on edge as I would just before a car crash, except the emotions were sustained over a period of time. The tension was absolutely unbearable. I didn't try to analyze or nitpick, I just went with it, and it affected me strongly. This is not a movie I will own and watch over and over again, because once you know what is coming, it destroys much of the technique that builds the suspense.

Her boyfriend takes her outside and shows her a the box of a ring. She's not sure and he gets upset.Back at the cabin, he's not in a talkative mood, she's still nice to him and trying to resolve things. At some point a woman knocks on the door asking for someone who doesn't live there. Later the knocks start again. Guy leaves to buy cigarettes. While he's away girl notices someone is in the house. Things are being moved, her cell phone disappears, etc. Guy comes back and now things get ugly. The strangers who now appear to be several destroy the windshield of his car and then crash into it with theirs.Our couple finally acts smartly, grab a shotgun and hide in a dark room ready to shoot at whatever shows up at the door. That doesn't go too well either. And we have them running out of the house to the shed, and back to the house. Eventually they are grabbed by the strangers who seem to be a family of 3: husband, wife, and daughter.The movie looks good, but has very annoying music. Several times characters turn on a LP player with songs, where the lyrics are supposed to be meaningful to us the audience. So the music has to be extremely loud so you get it. I can't stand this cheap filmmaker trick to make music a character in a movie and give hints or tell stories with lyrics. C'mon. If you have something to tell us, use the story or how about this: use dialogue. Speaking of dialogue, there's little in this movie as in most American movies, especially horror movies. He's an angry guy so he doesn't have much to say and she's just trying to appease him. The strangers don't say much at all.Still this is an effective, scary thriller that does not need to show much of a bloodbath. For the most part, the main characters act reasonably, but of course, script dictates that they always put themselves in harm's way. The strangers in the mean time, see everything, know everything and can predict everyone's moves. They look slightly scary due to the masks/rags they are wearing.

75,aharmas,"Tense, Dark, and Unforgiving",10,24 June 2008,"Some people might argue that we are living in the golden age of horror; however, most of the films we have been showered with have been slashers, though there have been occasional moments when we know that much more care has gone into making these productions stand out. Even most of the ""Saw"" series have explored a deeper psychological layer than the wave of the 80's that introduced us to ""Friday"" and ""Jason"".A few years ago, we had ""The Gift"" and ""The Skeleton Key"", both of which had some original twists. Here comes a movie that would have made the master of suspense more than proud, and if he had been alive, he might have taken a stab at it. ""The Strangers"" is a movie that grabs the audience by the throat and doesn't let go, even in its final moments, there is very little chance to experience any catharsis. It is a fine depiction of what suspense, horror, and despair must feel like. We are pretty much aware of the end result, but with much assured camera work, some nifty editing, and the right combination of visuals and sound effects, we are involved in a terrific drama, drama that goes deep into the minds of the predator and the prey, and it is scary and repulsive because we are unable to comprehend what really drives anyone's actions.""The Strangers"" deserved special recognition for not calling attention to itself with any special fanfare or sensational moments. It recalls other films and fixes what was wrong with them, as it presents scene after scene with a cold, painful, and direct hand. There is an exquisite balance among all its parts, and it shows because in the end, we manage to experience the whole ordeal, and we have somehow, escaped safely...",The Strangers
76,aidanratesmovies,I kept waiting for it to really start...,3,18 August 2021,"Weak plotting mixed with an incredibly dull attitude- The Strangers unfortunately offers nothing new to the horror genre- even with its somewhat unique sense of style. I have very little good to say about this movie, but altogether I didn't hate it. Yes it was bad, but the actors did try at times- the masks for the strangers were cool and menacing- and the film had a slick and rather unique sort of cinematography that was able to feel professional and personal all at once. Though with all of that, there is also the other side of things. The film looks so incredibly dark and grim at times that it makes the entire thing feel like one bland nightmare from beginning to end. Not to mention the actors can over-do it at times, and the screenplay is so criminally stupid its honestly hard to not shout at the screen at times. For a film that should be packed with such tense emotion and thrills, which I guess on one level it tried to do, the film itself is so mind-numbingly boring that it's honestly hard to care about anything that goes on screen- let alone empathize with our main character like we are supposed to. The concept is interesting, but it's been done several times before, and done far better. In the end, The Strangers is a forgettable and overrated little creeper that focuses on style more than substance- and somehow fails at both.My Rating: 2.5/10.",The Strangers
77,Jonny_Numb,"""Strangers"" than Fiction",7,1 June 2008,"There are those who have seen ""Halloween."" Those who have seen ""Scream."" And some who have seen those films and all points in-between. While I would consider myself a part of the latter categorization, I can say that ""The Strangers"" intrigued me with its menacing trailer and straightforward premise. And before I even walked into the Saturday-night screening, I had accurately predicted the audience that would be packing the theater: predominantly high-school age kids who had seen ""Halloween"" and ""Scream,"" and therefore fancied themselves experts on cinematic fear, and were not silent with their oh-so-academic awareness of genre conventions.As if I needed another reminder of why the American theater-going experience has become an obnoxious, obsolete activity (especially after the audience I saw ""The Mist"" with), I was reminded all over again with this crowd, who never stopped checking their cell phones, and never shut up, for that matter; I can understand a genuine scream or gasp at a frightening moment, but people who natter throughout an $8.50 movie like a cut-rate MST3K really baffles me.That being said, ""The Strangers"" (like ""The Mist"") will likely play better on DVD than theatricallyin the ""safety"" of a densely-populated theater, the tension can run the risk of diminishing what would alternatively be more effective in a private, more intimate setting. That being said, ""The Strangers"" worked me over quite well throughout, though its final third is especially blood-chilling.Having recently viewed the French import ""Them""the tale of young couple menaced by unseen tormentors at an isolated villa over the course of one long night, ""The Strangers"" has the misfortune of competing with a near-identical plot and scenario. Fortunately, writer-director Bryan Bertino (in his feature debut) sets his film apart with a randomness that ferments a palpable, ever-growing terror.James (Scott Speedman) and Kristen (Liv Tyler) are a couple undergoing an undefined conflict in the wake of a friend's wedding reception; they stop at their isolated summer home for the night and attempt to work out (and sulk in) their problems. Before long, a trio of masked assailants are terrorizing the couple, at first with seemingly prankish gestures (pounding on the front door, knocking the wind-chimes) and escalating to terrifying, life-and-death extremes. Bertino takes subtle cues from John Carpenter in photographing the disappearing-reappearing Strangers, but is more methodical (and less obvious) in his use of sound-effects to induce fright (the scenes without dialog and music tend to be the most effective here)throughout ""The Strangers,"" the situation (seemingly told in real-time) seems plausible, which only adds to the terror.There are only a few instances where ""The Strangers"" veers off course, and they all occur within the first 5 minutes: the opening crawl about violent-crime statistics and the introduction of our protagonists comes across as generic and unnecessarya heavy-handed attempt to ground the film in its ""Inspired by True Events"" claim; the use of a deep-voiced narrator to read this almost takes us out of the film before it even really starts. Additionally, a prologue (that is essentially three-fourths of the postscript) that shows ""the next day"" gives a bit too much away, making one shock scene midway through the film seem telegraphed and predictable.Otherwise, ""The Strangers"" is a sinister, satisfying scare flick. Speedman and Tyler possess the right amount of desperate, survival-minded chemistry that bigger marquee names would be unable to convey; Bertino's subjective window into their terror gives new reason to fear ""the things that go bump in the night,"" and presents murder as cold, detached, and utterly unglamorous endeavoran indifferent conclusion to a hard night's work.",The Strangers
78,Samiam3,"Almost there, has everything but a story.",6,29 October 2009,"It may be based on a true story, but it isn't much of one. Literally speaking, what we see is the same sequence repeated over and over again. The Strangers is not a bad horror film, but there is nothing remotely special about it... or is there? Interpreted as a slasher film, The Strangers is about average. When you analyze it with cinematic terms, however, it is something more unique. The Mise-en-Scene of The Strangers is an ideal example of how to stage and design a claustrophobic movie. Playing with camera focus, high contrast lighting and sense of space, The Stragers is expertly photographed, and frequently suspenseful, placing greater value on thrills/chills rather than guts and gore. The Strangers has everything except a screenplay. Even if you have all the resources in the world, you can't make a memorable movie with out a story.On the night that James Hoyt proposed to his girl Kristen McKay, he discovers when he pops the question that he had left his engagement ring at the house completely spoiling not only the surprise but the emotion. The two drive back to his place in the woods, both of them in a depressed, embarrassed state (he even redecorated the place for her). It doesn't take too long for them to make up, but things are about to go south again. That night, The lovely couple are stalked by three folks in mask. The phones are out, the car has been eviscerated, and they are in the middle of nowhere. What are they gonna do? By the way, I give props to Liv Tyler for getting her hands dirty for the first time.There are a number of moments in The Strangers which I can pin point and clearly say, this was taken from either Halloween, or Friday 13th, but I wouldn't say that this is a total rip off. Every year brings about a new generation of slice and dice, some are unwatchable and some are decent. The Strangers falls somewhere in between, probably a baby step closer towards the positive side. The intended audience for this material tend not to care about story, so therefore I suppose I could recommend this to those folks. Personally I would have liked to see a little more on the pages.",The Strangers
79,RatedVforVinny,Did not capture attention.,3,18 November 2018,"'The Strangers' had a melancholy vibe from the start and although builds some tension, I feel it never really delivers.

There are far better examples of this type of horror to seek out.",The Strangers
80,raulfaust,A great suspense movie,10,7 November 2010,"I first watched this movie with my ex-girlfriend just when it was released to the cinema. I remember her screams throughout the entire movie, and how angry I got at her for being so scared.But let's talk about the movie itself. It has an intense suspense climate, although taking a clichéd place to horror movies - big houses in the middle of nowhere. The actors are good in showing their terrified feelings to the spectators, even in the beginning when they couldn't see the mask dudes behind them. I think it was a great accomplishment in this movie, it terrifies the spectator before terrifying the actors themselves.In the first watch, I thought the ending was absurdly incomplete. But after watching lots of horror movies, I realized the one I remembered for long time and saw as a suspense pattern was ""The Strangers"" for not having an answer for the whole thing. 9/10 absolutely",The Strangers
81,Matt_Layden,They Use The Same Old Trick A Dozen Times,5,2 August 2009,"This is a suspenseful horror flick in which a couple stays at a rented home for the night after coming back from a wedding. He has just proposed to her himself, but it seems she said no because their is an awful funk between the two of them. They hear a knock at the door and what appears to be an innocent mistake of the wrong house, turns out to be a night of horror.The Strangers takes an old clichéd horror technique, of having the 'killer' appear somewhere in the background near the character, but then disappear as they turn around, and beat it to death. I couldn't even count how many times they used this technique, but it was completely redundant and lame. Sure, it's creepy at first because this is where we are first introduced to these killers, with masks and all, but after the 12th, 13th time, it just gets ridiculous.The two leads are Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman, do killers never attack ugly people? They don't have any romantic connection, but one can argue the script called for it. I was left asking myself if I ever cared for these two. They seem like they want to be together, but never give it a chance. Much like Luke Wilson and Kate Beckinsale in Vacancy, these two characters fought more often than acted like a couple. Note to producers: If you want the audience to care about these people, make them like each other. I'm not saying the two leads acted poorly, I just didn't care if they lived by the end.The film loses the tension early and the rest is the audience just waiting for the intruders to stop playing games and 'kill' them already. As a film from a first time director, it's watchable. The creepiness factor is there, if only for the first half. I wouldn't recommend this to horror fans, more to those teenage girls looking for something they would define as scary on a Friday night.",The Strangers
82,begob,Don't be a stranger,3,5 October 2014,"Simple home invasion thriller. A discontented couple are attacked in their remote house by a gang of masked villains. The villains are motiveless, so there's no mystery to uncover, and we rely on the couple to provide the twists and complications that make a story interesting. Sadly the best they can do is make stupid choices. Every time.The lifeline character is killed off fairly early, then the boyfriend runs outside with the gun to be ambushed, then the girlfriend runs outside in her bare feet and twists her ankle. At this point you want them to die.The boyfriend is killed, but the girlfriend flees again, only to be tackled to the ground. As she struggles with her assailant she grasps desperately for some weapon, anything, and her fingers close around ... a pizza cutter. Slash slash slash. Dawn breaks. She emerges in the light, bloodied and clutching a severed head with pepperoni stuck all over its face.The actual ending is worse because you've travelled in a ruler- straight line for 78 minutes to get there. This is produced and edited with some style, but the director wrote the drivelish screenplay. That takes nerve.",The Strangers

What ensues is a violent invasion by three strangers, their faces hidden behind masks. The couple find themselves in a violent struggle, in which they go beyond what either of them thought capable in order to survive.I was doubtful yet excited to see this movie. In the end, this movie doesn't really do it for me. It's just really disappointing because the trailer for the film makes it to be something much more thrilling and suspenseful. I found the pacing to be so slow that this movie bored me to tears. I found the tone of the film to be so dull that there were barely any scares to keep me interested. I found the atmosphere of the movie to be so boring and quiet that--you get what I mean.Some clichés are still here, although not a lot. The strangers are like fast traveling ghosts who can appear in a scene and disappear in a split second. Yeah, that annoyed me quite a bit. However, I feel sympathy towards the protagonists. This film has much better character development than most. Let me add this: Barely anything happens in this hour and a half film. That's the biggest complaint coming from me. Yeah, I'm exaggerating but, I kid you not, the ball does not get rolling in this movie at all.What did I like about the movie? Probably the first thirty or so minutes. Why? It was promising. That's until I realized right after that, the plot went nowhere. Seriously, think of the strangers banging and messing the protagonist's minds for the first half of the film. In the next half, think of people running, hiding, screaming...the movie was spinning its wheels after that.What I hope would be an at least decent, scary film turned out to be so boring and uninteresting that I was disappointed. The performances were decent, at best. Overall, this film is not worth your time. Horror fans may be severely disappointed and the film is just not suspenseful nor scary. The best you can get out of this movie is its trailer.",The Strangers

I always though it's going to be bleak allegedly based upon true events. But when you watch the movie, you will realize that it is better on characterization, screenplay and on horror. Hats off to director and especially Liv Tyler who made us believe in her. And her ability to scream is something I never expected out of her. Since from years we see her all dolled up as sweet loving girl. Scott Speedman makes the casting perfect, both Liv & Scott are so compatible that you start believing that it's an actually family in jeopardy. On the whole, watch it alone and enjoy.",The Strangers
85,DJAkin,The Previews were far more scary,5,14 June 2008,"This movie was not that scary. It was basically some dude wearing a burlap sack mask who stood still in the kitchen and Liv Tyler would not notice him. His sidekicks who wore non scary masks were not scary either. In fact, they were what you could tell were good looking girls under those masks. I know a lot of people thought it was scary when the girl stood 100 yards from the house motionless. However, I was not scared. I had high hopes. Toward the end when the three masked people are standing in front of Liv and her boyfriend, you are expecting some torture at least. I wish there would have been some name calling or psychological torture but I was left with nothing but a lame ending where kitchen knives are simply inserted into the victims. Wolf Creek this was NOT! Texas Chainsaw this certainly was not. I will give the movie a break though because I heard it was the first movie for the young director and the burlap sack mask was pretty scary. Still, I was hoping we would see his face and learn why he was breathing so hard. Two thumbs down.",The Strangers
86,Howlin Wolf,The Ordinaries.,5,14 September 2008,"The technical details were all good - location, sets, lighting, cinematography, sound etc, but aside from professional competence in these areas there were no flourishes added to the basic framework that made the story stand out. This could've been filmed without a script, beyond some very basic blocking techniques.I suppose there's nothing wrong with trying to make something that could almost be classed as a silent movie, but when most of your dialogue could well be redundant to the action, then silence should be used to make the film more challenging, not simpler.A few years ago the Coens had plans to make a silent movie about a pilot shot down in war (To the White Sea). To tell this story without words would've been a complex task. Filming people who we know nothing about running around a house terrorizing others isn't complex, so it needs more dimensions to it for my money to make it worthy of attention. It's such a basic plot on its own that you could film the same thing over again, give it a different name and pretend it's a different film. It doesn't have its own unique identity, because the characters have deliberately been made practically impossible to identify with. It's just one set of people putting another set in danger, but why should I care if I don't feel a connection to any of the characters? Ironically, given how Stephen King himself has praised this film for its celebration of random violence where nothing is elaborately explained, this author is the one who said it best in the prologue to the uncut edition of his novel ""The Stand"".He took the example of the classic myth Hansel and Gretel. The basic story is, some kids get lost in the woods, happen upon a house, get trapped by the old lady who runs the house, but break free and escape. You could tell the story exactly like that, but what really makes it stay with you are the little atmospheric touches that are included in the chain of happenings that everyone knows and loves - The house made of candy, following the trail of breadcrumbs, etc. Without those unique developments, what actually occurs is just run of the mill. King used this argument to explain why he wanted to restore all the extra detail his editors insisted be cut from the original released version of ""The Stand"". The Strangers is what that first tale would have been - a perfunctory tale with none of the additional details added that make events special and memorable.",The Strangers
87,punishmentpark,"Not always credible, but pretty creepy nonetheless.",6,29 November 2015,"The first time around, I quite liked this, but having seen it a second time, the credibility of (some of) the choices made by the protagonists dropped to almost zero at times. For instance, when Mike arrived in his car and was shot at, he was simply crazy to wander off into the house instead of turning around, speeding away and going for help.Other than that, the premise of the film is simple, but strong. The record player songs help with the atmosphere, as does the dramatic introduction of the story (and I don't mean the two boys going up the house, but the failed marriage proposal and the awkward situation that arises). The culprit family is pretty creepy, though their initial behaviour seems a little too haphazard to be truly credible.All in all, 'The strangers' is still (quite) doable, if you're willing to stretch your imagination for some fairly silly character choices.A good 6 out of 10.",The Strangers

90,chrichtonsworld,"""The Strangers"" is not worth your time",3,23 August 2008,"The praise for this movie is one of the main reasons to make this comment. To be clear this movie in no way deserves the rating it is given. There are far better suspense movies made with much lower ratings than ""The Strangers"" got. I have learned not to rely heavily on the ratings on IMDb. Still it does give some clue how a movie is received. So when I read the positive comments (in combination with the high rating) I was ready to be dazzled and surprised. It takes almost twenty minutes for some real tension to happen. From that moment until the last twenty minutes you will get bored to death with every cliché ever used in a horror movie. No creativity,no twists and turns to give this movie an edge. I don't mind seeing the same stuff over and over again when it is fun and thrilling. ""The Strangers"" fails in that department completely. Also the acting is pretty bad. We never get to learn a lot about the main characters other than some awkward moments between the couple. Liv who was proposed to flat out told Scott that she wasn't ready. I know that did was done to bring some sympathy to Scott's character. But then not much is done with this since we follow the story from Liv's point of view who at that time is not a character we really care for. It even gets worse when Scott returns from somewhere and doesn't believe Liv that she is being stalked by someone. There goes the sympathy. The whole proposal construct that took twenty minutes can now totally be ignored. (I do want to make a side point about the whole failed proposal thing. You have this guy who has gone to great lengths to make it a perfect day for him and what he thought his future wife. Then he gets rejected so hard that he does not get mad once or show any other form of negative reaction. He remains calm and sweet and even goes out to buy cigarettes for Liv. Come on! That must be the prefect guy ever.) The premise is simple and could have made an interesting watch since it tunes in to ancient fears (like being home alone in the dark). However there is a lot more needed to make a movie truly scary. For a movie as this to work you have to grab immediate attention and pull them in the story. A slow build up is nice when the pay off is grand and in this case it just isn't. People in masks are always effective to set a mood and creep you out. But what was the point of using these masks if the viewer never get to see the faces of these strangers. This is one example of an element used in the movie that needed something original or at least more sense. There is one good surprise in the movie. Sadly it isn't enough to convince me of the so called brilliance of this movie. Not worth your time.",The Strangers
91,baumer,The characters in Friday the 13th are Rhodes Scholars compared to the characters in The Strangers,1,7 July 2008,"If you are a fan of horror films, then you have probably seen Scream. In it, Randy, the resident expert of the idiocy of horror movies, gives you the rules of horror films. In it he tells of all the things you should do in a horror film, but end up not doing anyway. I think this film is inspired by Randy's dialogue in Scream. This is the most clichéd horror film in the history of clichéd horror films. Comparing this to Halloween or the Shining makes me throw up in my mouth a little. It is just plain blasphemy. This is nothing like the greats from the 70's and the 80's. It's not even as good as CHUD, Friday the 13th or any other decent but flawed horror film.The problem with this film is that everything that these characters should not do, they do. Now, THERE ARE GOING TO BE PLENTY OF SPOILERS HERE SO IF YOU REALLY DON'T WANT TO KNOW ANYTHING FURTHER BECAUSE YOU ACTUALLY PLAN ON WATCHING THE FILM, THEN DO NOT READ ANY FURTHER.First, you are being hunted in the house, you have a shotgun that can blow a hole through an elephant, and you are in a room that has one way in and one way out. You are safe. All you have to do is wait it out or the both of you leave the house together with the safety of the shotgun. Or of course the alternative is to separate and one person stays behind without the shotgun, the other goes to a barn to find a two way radio. The last thing sane people do is separate. If I was being hunted in my cottage with my wife by my side, the last thing I would do is let her stay behind while I go find a radio. She would be by my side all the time.The best friend comes over at about 4 in the morning. He sees his buddies car bashed up. He sees the door with axe marks in it. He can see that something isn't quite right. Then has something smash his window. What should he do? Before entering the house, he should call the police and report suspicious behavior. But no, of course not, he enters the house with the loud playing music and doesn't call his friends name, or turn the music off, he of course walks silently into the open doorway and gets shot in the face by his best friend.The classic case of not believing your girlfriend when she tells you that someone has been in the house. ""No sweetie, you just imagined that you saw someone and you must of dropped your cell into the fire."" Sure that happens all the time.Every one of these characters deserved to die. They were stupid, unrealistic and completely clichéd in the worst possible way. And for the makers of the film to pretend this is based on true events is ever so manipulative. I read the supposed case this is based on and saying this is based on a true story is like saying Rambo is a love story. It's just plain wrong.The Strangers is one of the most incompetent films I have ever seen. There is no suspense, no thrills, no chills. There could of been, but you lose all feelings of remorse or sense of caring for the main characters because the screenplay betrays them so much.1/10 Truly, truly horrible film.",The Strangers
92,IonicBreezeMachine,Bryan Bertino makes an impressive debut with an almost documentary like approach to horror.,7,31 July 2021,"Following an evening at a friend's wedding reception, Kristen (Liv Tyler) and James (Scott Speedman) go to their isolated vacation home to re-assess their relationship following Kristen's rejection of James' proposal. Over the course of the night, the two are visited by strangers asking for someone who doesn't live there and the strangers escalate to more aggressive and violent actions over the course of the night.Released in the summer of 2008, and written and directed by Bryan Bertino in his feature film debut, The Strangers became a sleeper hit earning $80 million against its $9 million budget but was devisive among critics and audiences with some feeling the film was exploitative, while others looked more favorably upon the film comparing its minimalist approach to benchmarks of the 70s. While the movie is intense, it's hardly exploitative and is probably one of the most human horror films to appear in this genre.From the movie's opening text crawl that reads like an obituary, the movie plays itself close to the ground with almost documentary like approach to the film's proceedings as if it were talking about real life crimes and real life victims. In many ways I was reminded of John Larroquette's opening narration from The Texas Chainsaw Massacre or Vern Stierman's commentary in the underrated film The Town that Dreaded Sundown. The opening sequence where we transition from the opening text and narration to a 911 call creates a chilling feeling of dread as we approach the film's events. Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman are well cast with believable chemistry playing a very much in love but also strained couple who carry a sense of weight to their performances that makes them rich enough as characters they could have been placed in a domestic drama with little effort. The opening set-up where we see our two leads is heavy with character as we see James' plans for his proposal scattered throughout the house and an uncomfortable reminder of their relationship to the both of them.The titular Strangers are well introduced and presented as we are introduced to a seemingly innocuous knock on the door only to have the strangers repeatedly return upping the ante on the previous action with genuinely creepy performances and delivery. While The Strangers' dialogue is minimal, just enough is given to make them a presence without demystifying their terror. We never get a good look at their faces and even when our characters do, we're kept in the dark only seeing just enough to know the people under the masks are seemingly ordinary with nothing distinguishing them.The movie only runs about 77 minutes, but it does noticeably drag due to the limited location and story beats that keep the two from leaving. While the movie does a good job of keeping its limited location and setup from becoming stale, the rhythm the film goes into with its characters not managing to escape or being scared by booming thuds does get noticeably repetitive, but thankfully Bertino manages to keep things interesting thanks to his usage of grounded filmmaking and avoids jump scares and orchestral stings instead relying on atmosphere.The Strangers is a well made minimalist exercise in domestic horror anchored by two strong leads and good direction by Bertino who mines all he can from a seemingly anemic premise. The Strangers make for compelling antagonists playing like a mixture of the Manson Family and Michael Myers and while the film does feel maybe a bit stretched in terms of its content the sheer intensity and craft keeps viewers on edge throughout.",The Strangers
93,jaredmobarak,Is Tamara there?The Strangers,5,28 May 2008,"I am all for the torture porn genrethe Saw films are entertaining, yes even the fourth, and I thoroughly enjoyed Hostel. First time writer/director Bryan Bertino has decided to throw his cap into the ring with the new film The Strangers. Supposedly based on true events, the movie ends up running similarly to Haneke's Funny Games, except without the social commentary and instead more contemporary scare tactics with masks, (I'll admit that seeing the faces of the killers as human beings is far scarier because you can relate to them on some level, rather than the monsters behind a disguise, thus this film doesn't live up to the comparison). However, Bertino gives us a very well done piece of cinema that engages us by being as unsettling as humanly possible. With almost every frame being an extreme close-up, the creepiness of old-time Arlo Guthery era country tunes on the record player, and long stretches of complete silence, The Strangers will most definitely get you unhinged. My question, then, is whether that is enough to make a work good. I don't quite think so, because despite the artistry and the effectiveness of mood, I just don't find watching a 90 minute double homicide all that fun, especially when there is no reason for it. Haneke definitely was on the ball in that regard, having meaning behind the torture, (oh and I'm a film fan, so I reference the original Austrian version of Funny Games, not the rehashed American-remake).Much like last year's Vacancy, we are shown our heroes at a time where their relationship is strained. This is not a happy couple going to a summer home for some rest and relaxation, no they are pretty much together because they have to be under the circumstances. Our entry point to them is a tear-streaked Liv Tyler and a stoic, repressed anger mixed with embarrassment faced Scott Speedman. A lot is going on between these two, and the film does let us in on the trouble, mostly before the ""fun"" begins, but also a bit during the activities. Maybe it just seems like we as an audience find it necessary for our lead characters to overcome an emotional struggle on top of the physical one being inflicted on them. I just find it to be overkill; the story is about the people coming in and partaking in their random crime, not whether the torture can bring love back to a pair who has seemingly lost it. It is nice to see a more fleshed out victim than just a two-dimensional punching bag, so I can't quite blame Bertino for trying. We are given this background to relate to them and feel for their plight; maybe I just would have liked more. Rather than glossing over the relationship to get to the strangers' arrival, a more Hostel-like introduction would have worked better, allowing a slow burn to the inevitable terror.Is the film scary though? This is the all-important question. I may not be the best to answer, as I don't generally get scared at movies. However, I was definitely uncomfortable during the proceedings. Not just with the cat and mouse chase, but with every aspect of the film. Bertino deserves full marks for this as he really makes us delve farther into the frame than we probably want to. Almost the entire work is shot in close-ups, putting the static details in our faces along with the emotionally wrought expressions on the actors' faces. Knives scraping, things burning in the fireplace, blood splatters on the wall, and even the record player's arm are shown as close as possible, assaulting our sight at the same time our ears are barraged with the sounds singled out above the background so that we experience every second. The creepy factor is most definitely enhanced once our trio of mask wearing freaks enters the stage. Their slow, methodical movements and sheer confidence in what they are doing is relayed very effectively.And the acting is quite gooda major complement since Tyler and Speedman have never been two people I rave about acting-wise. The repressed emotions at the start slowly peek their way out once the games commence, they both are realistic in the portrayals and despite what my friend says she saw through sunglasses and fingers covering her eyes, I don't think they fell into too many horror cliché traps. Yes, you shouldn't open the door when you hear banging at four in the morning, however, they also think it's just a youngish girl looking for her friend. I gave them the benefit of the doubt in that regard; when you're fighting for your life, you may not think clearly. I do have to also mention Glenn Howerton as Mike. Does he get much screen time? No. Does he do a decent job? For sure. However, I only mention him because of ""It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia"" and how this role reminded me of his character in that show. I believe I was the only one in the theatre chuckling at his entranceOh Dennis Reynolds.Again, though, while expertly crafted and meticulously shot, what was the true purpose of this film? It's definitely creepy, but as a horror, I don't think it succeeds in the scares. Instead it is basically an exercise in torture and survival against a group of people out to cause pain. I also I had some trouble with the ending and the final confrontation. The almost ritualistic activities at the conclusion seem out of place from what had preceded it, however, I did really enjoy the encounter with two young Bible-pushers on the street.

94,hall895,Stupid people tormented by stupid killers,3,12 September 2012,"Here we have a horror movie which sadly is much more laughable than scary. The characters are stupid. The story, not that there actually is much of a story, is stupid. There are no big scares to jolt you out of your seat. Really there's nothing to prevent you from yawning or flat-out dozing off. When the movie ended I was stunned to find out it was less than 90 minutes long. It seemed much longer. It honestly feels interminable. Please just let the killers put their victims out of their misery. Then we who have the misfortune to be watching can be put out of our misery as well.So the setup is that a young couple, played by Scott Speedman and Liv Tyler, are spending the night in some house out in the middle of nowhere. There's a knock on the door. A really, really loud knock. That's about the most chilling thing the movie has to offer, a loud knock on the door. Anyhow our young couple ends up being terrorized by three people in goofy masks. Everyone involved, goofy mask people and their potential victims, acts very stupidly. Our victims have apparently never seen any horror movies as, rather than wait in the house with the freaking shotgun they have, they decide to go running around outside in the dark. Because running around in the dark always ends well in these situations, no? Our silly mask people are very lucky that their prey are so stupid because they are quite stupid themselves. If anyone involved in this story had any working brain cells the whole thing would've been over in five minutes. And what a blessed relief that would have been. Instead it goes on and on, Liv Tyler just keeps screaming and the would-be killers just keep, well, standing there. They never really do anything. Ooh, look a guy with a bag on his face is standing in the corner! Scary, right? Nope, not really. There is no action, no drama, no tension. It's all very predictable right from the beginning, probably not helped by the fact the movie basically gives away its ending right at the start. We go through all the horror movie clichés as the movie limps meekly towards a thoroughly unsatisfying end. Boring, unoriginal, quite stupid. That's The Strangers in a nutshell.",The Strangers
95,MrGKB,The scariest thing about this tyro effort...,4,25 June 2009,"...is that it put as many butts into theater seats as it did, which means (of course) that there's going to be a sequel. Oh, gosh! I can't wait! Starring Liv ""I'm really, really trying to play against stereotype here"" Tyler and Scott ""Underworld"" Speedman, along with three utterly unknown actors hidden behind masks (for which I'm sure they're grateful), ""The Strangers"" is a frustratingly uneven rendition of far too many better films. Theodore Sturgeon would simply point to it and say, ""What did I tell you?"" What's most irksome is that there's no shortage of talent and craft; portions of the film are actually pretty effective. The camera wrangling by DP Peter ""Donnie Brasco"" Sova is good, the tomandandy score adds some nice tension, along with the evocative sound design, and the acting (though hardly Oscar-worthy) is competent enough. And yet (oh, dear gods! There's always that 'And yet...'!) it all comes to nothing worth more than a moment's notice. Technique can never truly compensate for lack of substance. When will Follywood ever admit to this? Probably not until the adolescent/young adult public stops paying its hardly-earned money to entertain itself with throwaway movies.I suppose I should be more lenient, in that ""The Strangers"" is writer/director Bryan Bertino's maiden voyage into film-making. Still, a quick glance at his IMDb creds shows that that's no excuse; he's been in the business long enough to know what's ""creative"" and what isn't. If ""The Strangers"" had been the work of an established director, I'd have had to give it just as poor a rating, if not worse. That it's the man's own script is even more damning. At this point he's proved himself to be nothing more than a sophisticated, connected hack who can helm the production of a make-work film with nary an original idea in its mercenary little brain.Check out the self-important ""Making of"" featurette on the DVD release. ""The trees are characters,"" sez one of his tech people. Yeah, right. Check out the self-conscious lopsided ""smile"" on Bertino's mug as he prattles on about his derivative high concept.Let's just be honest here for once. This movie is garbage masquerading as low-fi creativity. I hope Tyler was paid well for her participation, since the artistic side of her resume hasn't been improved upon one iota.This is one of those films that makes one realize that, disheartening as it may be, the cutting of public library funding may well be justified.",The Strangers
96,TOMASBBloodhound,Nothing new here.,5,26 June 2012,"Though first-timer Bryan Bertino has proved he can craft individual scenes of terror, this project as a whole is about as deep as a puddle after a spring shower. I'm sure there are famous directors whose first efforts were much less than this. And this film did make a very respectable profit, but by the time the credits rolled I found myself undoubtedly underwhelmed. Of course this is one of those horror films either based on or inspired by true events as the opening credits insist. And the scenario here reminded me of nothing except the Manson Family murders. A couple of the techniques like loud door knocking are recycled from other films like The Fog or Vacancy. I really didn't see much original inspiration at work here.The film begins with a young couple arriving at a deserted country house in the wee morning hours after a wedding. The night has apparently not gone so well as you can see tears rolling down Liv Tyler's lovely face right off the bat. It seems as though her studly boyfriend has proposed to her, and she turned him down. What? These days most women can't wait to dive into a marriage and start squirting out kids! And she turned him down?? Digressing here... Anyway, it looks as if the two will spend the rest of the night talking things out and maybe even... Knock Knock Knock! The two find a young woman outside asking for a woman who obviously does not live there. After learning the news, the girl begins to walk away telling them she'll see them later. Foreshadowing here! Then the guy decides to make a cigarette run for his gal. Uh huh. Well it is Liv Tyler, and I'd probably make a cigarette run for her at any time, as well! Maybe this will change her mind about the proposal! Whatever the reason he goes it really doesn't matter. From this point on, two girls and a guy begin terrorizing the young couple who are cut off from the rest of civilization. Of course they let the young man back inside the house when he returns with the smokes, and then things really get testy as he tries to fight them off with a shotgun. Writer/director Bertino drags this siege out much longer than he needs to, but since his conclusion is so honest and abrupt I suppose he had to get the thing close to 90 minutes in whatever way possible.I guess I just didn't find this situation logical. There are only 3 attackers. Two of them small women. I know the Manson murderers had a similar roster and took out at least four when they murdered Sharon Tate. But the Manson group had a pistol and the people they killed were unarmed! In one scene the boyfriend mentions that he had only bragged about hunting as a boy and may not know how to load the shotgun. Hello! It isn't that hard to load a standard pump 12 gage, dude. And anyone who had one at his disposal should have had no trouble fighting off these three spooks. Hard to believe these three would have stuck around to finish the job after they find out their victims are armed, either. The film ends really the only way it realistically could when the time comes for it to end. However this ending does not make good cinema. There is no triumphant turning of the tables or empowerment of the victims. They just sit there and get carved up. The killers drive off into the sunrise and one assures the rest that the next time it will go smoother. And yes, it is safe to say these three could probably use some Mormon teachings. But as Billy Joel once sang, ""Sinners are much more fun"". 5 of 10 stars.The Hound.",The Strangers

98,joebloggscity,Home Invasion torture escapade - lite,2,24 October 2021,"Nothing here to report, although I just found out this film was given a sequel so some must have liked it.Anyhow, it's bog standard idea with some spooky home invaders tackling some really nice home which is occupied by picture perfect middle class couple in America and so on. They are mentally tortured, then physically and you likely know the rest. It's nothing new, there's been a bunch of these movies over the years, like Last House on the Left, the Purge and you can add the end bit of Straw Dogs & Tarantino's Charles Manson movie and plenty of others.The only real difference here is that this film is actually not that gratuitous compared to its peers. Supposedly more psychological, but I was never spooked out or on tenterhooks or even frightened. It's horror-lite! Couple of jump scares (only one worked).I think that if Liv Tyler was never in this movie, likely it would never have been given any attention.It's not big budget, so credit for trying at least, and on a small budget it does look good. However, it just didn't grab me. I'm not really into torture porn anyhow even there have been some good dark movies in the field we all have to admit.One thing was that there were a lot of question marks as in, why did he/she do this or that or why didn't they do this or that.There isn't anything to say here.

99,mario_c,"""Are you a sinner? – Sometimes!""",8,15 October 2009,"THE STRANGERS is a dark suspenseful horror thriller that takes tension to the edge, as it puts the viewer tense from the beginning to the end!When the movie starts it's said to be ""inspired by true events"". I don't know if it's really based on a true story or not, but it seems to be just a way to shock to viewer from the beginning. A true story is always more shocking than a fictional one, right? Well, if it's really based on true events or not I guess it didn't matter too much for me, because what I really appreciated in this movie was its cinematography and the way to make suspense they used: They focused in the psychological side and made it really intense, dark, almost claustrophobic at parts! The ambiance is really frightening and the dark light used is half way to create tension! The soundtrack and the creepy sounds are also very good! About the characters, there aren't too much I must say, but those sinister figures wearing weird mask and appearing and disappearing like ghosts are really awesome! They are mysterious, scary, weird and merciless but almost have an innocent look at the same time! ""Are you a sinner? – Sometimes!"" This line between a kid that is distributing Christian flyers and one of the sinister girls near the end is remarkable! But those two women and man are really bizarre! Anyway, another thing I did appreciate in this film was the ending. I use to enjoy open endings and this one is a good one We don't get to know who really those strange figures are and we never see their faces behind their masks.It's a nice psychological horror thriller, with a good pace and suspense until the end.",The Strangers

As ther they start being harassed through out the nigh by people in masks. The harassment gets worse as lives start to be held in the balance.This movie was not bad its just not what I was expecting.

102,raymond-15,Mainly atmospheric sound effects,6,23 April 2009,"Omit the sound effects and what have you left? Not very much.If you watch this film alone at night you'll find it pretty scary. Especially the knocking on the door. It's hard to know which door it is. Is it the door in the film or is it your own? The knocking starts again. It's quite frightening. Hang on to your seat.There is little dialogue which is a pity because it's hard to understand what's happening. Sure, we know it's night time and there's a young couple making love in a house but who are these masked strangers determined to enter and why? It happens that the couple have an old shot gun on an upper shelf which the man uses in self defence. The intruder collapses with a nasty wound to the head. If you are of mild temperament you may wish to throw up when the camera gives you a close-up of the wound. Shattered flesh is not pretty.Apart from that incident most of the time is spent searching for shadowy figures among the trees outside. The couple try to escape in their car but the car is rammed by another which appears out of the darkness. Another unexplained incident.When the girl is left alone in the house she seems to spend an interminable time creeping around with a carving knife in her hand. Stupidly she throws back the curtains and there's a threatening face at the window.

103,acidburn-10,Don't always listen to the bad reviews,7,20 March 2009,"A young couple James (Scott Speedman) and Kristen (Liv Tyler) leave a wedding party and goes to James father's remote house, well after that things go from bad to worse as they end up being terrorised by 3 assailants, will James and Kristen survive the night, and why are these masked strangers terrorising them and what do they want.After reading some really bad reviews and bad comments from my friends who said that this movie is crap, of course I still wanted to see it, as I found the storyline was interesting and I liked what I saw from the previews. When I finally saw this movie, I actually kinda liked it, although it's no masterpiece and it does have quite a few flaws, but overall I found it a pretty decent movie.Although the plot isn't original, This kind of plot has already been done in recent movies such as ""Vacancy"" and ""Funny Games"" but they failed, and ""The Strangers"" manages to have achieved what those movies didn't, success, judging from the box office, ""The Strangers"" became a surprise hit grossing over $50 million dollars while the other 2 Funny Games and Vacancy didn't even make half that much and therefore both flopped.The Strangers is the kind of movie where you take a second look around the house before you go to bed, just to make sure that everything's in order. It's not a movie about a family sitting crying in a couch for an hour and a half, this is all about the chase. The three masked villains really toy with the young couple and have full control over the situation at all times. They appear when you least expect them to and you're not even sure that they're harmful at first. There are scenes in this movie that generally make jump out of your seat, that really make your heart jump out of it's skin. Scott Speedman plays the leading hero part well despite making some several stupid mistakes, but despite that he really has charm and charisma and makes his character James believable. Liv Tyler is also another great edition to the horror genre, she really plays her part well, I've always liked Liv Tyler after seeing her in some great movie like (Empire Records, Armagedden, The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy and The Hulk), so it was odd to see her in this kind of movie, I heard that they say there are only 2 reasons why big name stars would star in a horror or slasher flick, No.1, they're just starting out trying to make the big time like Jessica Biel did in (The Texas Chainsaw Massacre) and well look at her she ended up a major A-list star. Or the 2nd reason is that an actor career's fading. But I don't think Liv Tyler's career will be okay, although I thought after (The Lord Of The Rings Trilogy) that her would have soared but sadly it didn't with rubbish such as ""Jersey Girl"" with Ben Affleck and after that she disappeared for a while and came back last year with 2 smash hits this and ""The Hulk"". Her character in this is likable and sympathetic, although she does make the classic slasher movies mistakes like running out of the house without a weapon or falling over and spraining her ankle while she was being chased. Despite of this Liv Tyler is definitely top notch in this role, a definite Scream Queen.Nevertheless, no movie is flawless but The Strangers certainly comes close. For those of you expecting a torture porn flick, you will be disappointed. I think that's the reason why some of my friends didn't like the movie because they were expecting something gory and instead they got a tense thriller.Sll in all The Strangers is a genuinely intense and creepy horror flick, and also hats off to the people who played the masked strangers they really played they're parts well and are genuinely creepy and disturbing.And lastly watch out for the ending it's really disturbing.",The Strangers
104,Darkside-Reviewer,Jump scares!,4,19 April 2021,"The Strangers (2008) is a home invasion horror movie that was both written and directed by Bryan Bertino. The movie begins with a brief monologue with some on screen text that tells the audience that the movie is in fact based on real events. This is a complete lie that is designed to trick gullible movie goers into being shocked and frightened by the movies violence and home invasion theme. The idea for the movie plot was inspired by the infamous Manson family murders from 1969. Another inspiration for the movie was from a personal experience director Bryan Bertino had growing up in a suburban neighbourhood, where anonymous people knocked on doors in his home neighbourhood asking for a random person as a way of finding out if the owners were home before attempting to burgal the property. So in truth this movie is based on true events as much as the movie Cloverfield is.The movie itself is a very slow paced Horror/Thriller that relies heavily on jump scares and gotcha moments. The movie takes place in a small somewhat secluded cottage. The first forty minutes of the movie are spent following a young couple as they go through a rather awkward breakup after Liv Tyler's character denies a marriage proposal from Scott Speedman's character. The movie tries way too hard to build suspense by having the three intruders lurking silently in the background as the characters wander the house. However all the intruders really do for a vast majority of the movies running time is play games with their victims by walking around the house creepily, writing messages on the windows and knocking on doors loudly. Their's no real violence until the last five minutes of the movie when the intruders have finally had enough of playing games with their victim's and finish them off. The ending is very anticlimactic that enjoys taking it's sweet time building to a jump scare that's so predictable it wouldn't frighten a three year old never mind grown adults.The Strangers drags itself to an hour and twenty minutes just barely qualifying as a feature length film. The Strangers came out about twenty years too late when these kinds of horror movies had been done to death (No pun intended). I don't recommend paying to own this movie on Blu Ray or 4K/UltraHD (If it even gets a 4K/UltraHD release) it's honestly not worth the price of the plastic the disk is made from.",The Strangers

106,rajdoctor,The Strangers,5,4 August 2008,"I saw the trailers of this movie and had read review  which were not bad. I think the director employed a good ploy by positioning it as a 'inspired from true event' tag. I saw this movie with my friend Aslihan  who was gracious to sit through (with closed eyes) to give me company.After a party two close friends James (Scott Speedman) and Kristen (Liv Tyler) come to an isolated summerhouse to spend the night. The time is 4:00 am and after a while, there is a knock on the door  Is Tamar here? A girl asks. On denial  she goes off, and comes back again with two other intruders I won't disclose further, and would leave it for you to go and see it yourself what happens afterwards The plot of the movie is wafer thin. The purpose of the movie is just to scare the audience. It uses clever introduction of FBI evidence and inspired from true events  just to fool the audience to make believe what follows  could have happened. It is a good gimmick. It uses every cliché available and already used to scare the audience. But does it work? For me it worked, because I saw the movie on its own merit  without comparing it with other similar movies I might have seen. And I think the movie held interest in scaring people.This is the first movie of Writer  Director Bryan Bertino  who does a decent job in presenting a flick that does not show ugly faces, blood, gory violence till the first half. The sound editing and camera work and timing of selection of horror scene is fantastic.Two central characters  Scott and Liv - have done a decent job to live up the role. There are many stupid and foolish moments, but who cares when one is having so much fun being scared!

107,asda-man,Some not so friendly house guests,8,9 October 2011,"This isn't the first time I've seen ""The Strangers"". I saw it once about two years ago with my family and I didn't think that much to it. In fact back then I would've probably have given it a 6/10. But, last night I decided to dig it out once again and give it a watch alone at 11:00pm and it gave me a whole new perspective of the film. It takes a lot to scare me, but watching ""The Strangers"" on my own, in the dark actually did scare me quite a bit.""The Strangers"" does have a lot of strengths, but it also has weaknesses which unfortunately does stop it from being a classic horror film that can be watched over and over again (like ""Inside"" for instance). One of its massive strengths is its incredibly realistic atmosphere. I mean it says at the start its based on a true story (remind you of something?) but that doesn't necessarily mean it makes it any scarier. Here it does. The director could've completely ruined the atmosphere by placing naff music and crazy music video editing, but instead her builds up a beautifully realistic atmosphere that really did get to me.""The Strangers"" also does give out plenty of shocks. There are genuinely creepy moments that are directed incredibly well. It also does use quite a few jumpy moments but instead of being naff they actually are really frightening and each jump did give me shivers all over my body which does not happen very often at all. You help but to imagine one of the strangers standing outside your house. The reason why they are so scary (apart from the creepy maskies) is the way they make very little movement and say nothing with absolutely no motive at all. They're so ominous because we know absolutely nothing about them.The director (wish I knew his name) also makes great use of sound. Instead of over-using stings whenever an intruder appears, he uses no music at all which makes much much much much more creepier because it seems so realistic. Whenever he does use stings instead of really unscary drum beats or whatever he uses very sharp sounding sounds which only serves to enhance the scares. Diegetic sounds are also used brilliantly, especially with the frightening banging at the door at the beginning, which makes you feel as scared as the protagonists! However, there are some weaknesses. The film does start to feel unnecessarily slow at the beginning with all the awkward silences which is OK for 10 minutes or so, but not for about 20 minutes (well it felt like 20 minutes) you just feel eager for the strangers to come and hurry up! But when they do come it is really engaging and gripping. But, the film does feel too short, I could've watched another 15 minutes at least and I do feel it did have more to offer us. They're just wasn't enough thrills and spills, the majority of the film was taken up by exhilarating suspense, which is completely fine! But, it needs a pay off where we can have a little action between the couple and the strangers. Also, for a home invasion film, a lot of the time was spent outside so we couldn't get that claustrophobic atmosphere the whole time.The film also does use a lot of clichés, but in a different and unusual way. It does seem like the writer/director has just wanted to do a re-run of what's been done before but in a different stlye. The couple also made a lot of annoying decisions and were a bit too dopey to fight back.But, weaknesses aside, ""The Strangers"" is a complete suspense overload. It is engaging and truly terrifying, but to be fed the full potential you must watch it in the night, in the dark, in a house (it's not going to work in a tent is it!) and on your own with the sound turned up. Then you're almost guaranteed to be creeped out. If only it could've had some thrills and kills (like ""Inside"" for example, I shouldn't have said that really because now this review doesn't have any short and snappy ending. Oh well, I could always press backspace and take it all out but I can't be bothered. Goodnight.)",The Strangers

Then a girl knocks on the door in the middle of the night, asking if a girl named Tamara is home. Not knowing any Tamara's they send her away, thinking she ended up at the wrong house by mistake. Soon after that trouble begins, as it usually does.Tension flicks like this need two things to work out: you need to be able to care about the ""good"" characters and the tension field must be there constantly and grow stronger over time. It works for this film, for the most of the time. But there are some holes and some effects that are just too cheap and easy and therefore breaking it a bit.All in all it becomes a more or less run of the mill horror flick that would have been a whole lot better if they had steered clear of the classy cheesy shock effects that make up the bulk of the real bad stuff.

The Strangers set out with a menacing and creepy mood, then built to extreme tension as the plot progressed. The scares are slyly crafted and genuinely effective! The direction was great, giving not only eerie atmosphere but creating a sense of nerve-wracking fear that most horror movies these days can't pull off. There was no cheesiness, no comic-relief, and no over-the-top gore, just straight-faced thrills. The plot was simple, the acting adequate, the music good, but it's the powerful suspense and numerous effective shocks that ruled this fantastic horror film.Horror fans you won't be disappointed, flock to this film!

The couple managed to get out the house on several occasions, I don't get why they didn't just run.The couple: this film has a complete lack of depth when it came to the married couple, I knew nothing about them at all. The film just jumps right into it. So when they are being ""hunted"" I didn't have a connection to them. The dynamic between the couple I didn't get either. In the first 2 minutes they are upset with each other, then kissing, then upset again. It was hard to get if they actually loved each other or not.silence: this film has long periods of silence. Now this is fine if it's met with suspense, but it's not. The silence goes on and on and is met with a whole load of nothingthe 2 kids at the end I don't understand (you'll know when you watch)I will compliment it though. The first half of the film especially the suspense built up was done really well. The music and noises really emphasised it all and the situation they are in.

113,Shattered_Wake,Hollywood needed to do more here. . .,4,23 June 2008,"There comes a time when we all must ask. . . Do the people who claimed this film to be 'terrifying' truly find it scary or is it scary relative to the other films being released? Do they simply not know about the past's fine horror films that rise high above this film in terror? Or is the fear being somehow subconsciously inflated to make them think it was more frightening than it actually was? Because, to be honest. . . popping up behind windows, standing at the ends of driveways, and looming in shadowy corners can only be scary for so long before it gets old. I'll admit it: the first couple times gave me a little jump. But, after the fourth, fifth, and sixteenth times? Not very effective at all. Sadly, that's what happened here. The filmmakers beat these few scare tactics they had in their utility belt to death and it greatly hurt the effect the film had. What was left? Not much. . .The sparse, and sometimes boring, script and same old ""hide in the closet. . . no, hide in the barn. . . no, hide in the pantry"" pattern didn't work very well here. We needed something new. . . we needed Hollywouldn't to take a risk here and bring their horror to the next level, like an apology to all of us who still have even a tiny bit of (waning) faith in the town during this endless run of lack of originality. Sadly, they didn't do it and it failed.To be fair, there were a couple positives to the film. The acting was good: Liv 'Ironic First Name' Tyler did a fantastic job, and Scott Speedman's performance was more than adequate. Also, the ballsy ending did work for me. However, it was ruined for us by the (false) opening narration and 'Ils-Them'. . . 'Ils', however, did it better, in my opinion.Overall, 'The Strangers' fell flat as much as Liv Tyler's character in an escape from the masked invaders.Final Verdict: 4/10. -AP3-",The Strangers

We are shown great suspenseful scenes, our heroine, played by no other than Liv Tyler, is being stalked by 3 maniacs, while she is all alone in the isolated house. As soon as her boyfriend comes home, it seems like director lost the idea of what he exactly wants to do with the movie. It is obvious that our heroine alone isn't any match for the trio of lunatics who just keep toying with her and that is very boring to watch. Jump scare ending is also cheap as ever. Therefore, I can't score this movie higher than 6/10 and that is only because of the promising beginning. I don't really recommend it...",The Strangers

(1) idiot, idiot, idiot, James shoot his best friend without not looking if it is killer or if its his friend he shoot a person without not noticing who it is ???? idiot !!!! then it could be 3 group vs 3 group of killers. (2) NEVER LEAVE YOUR GIRLFRIEND buy herself Alone without weapon without any back up, James goes buy himself with shotgun with no smart plan in his head he is just being idiot, if i was him i would stay in house lock up everything, block everything wait until cops come wait until dawn i am pretty sure killers won't wait until dawn, or unless if they got their small truck to smash their house, unless that i thought it was stupid of James to leave house buy himself with shotgun leaving his girlfriend behind in danger ! stupid idiot, stupid writers !! 
(3) James and Kristen run to car even with flat tire could of parked in garage even more better, James start car doesn't even matter if it was a flat tire i would just keep on driving, truck comes, James get out tells Kristen i am like ??? keep driving car ! but some how killers doesn't burn the car in first place ? before they planning to escape, but no movie has to wait until lead characters have plan b to escape again in car ? i am like laughing to death, saying to myself why could they just get in car and start driving it ? 
(4) when James may god got shotgun trying to shoot killer lady then point's it at killer just shoot why wait for her to turn her light to blind him, he saw her first shoot that b*tch but no he has to wait until she sees him ? she blinded him and then got knocked out buy mask man i am like ? ok stupid leaving his girlfriend behind..... stupid idiot.

118,dead47548,A tease in the hope of an original horror film.,4,6 June 2008,"I'm not entirely sure how I feel about the film. On one hand, it's a brilliant concept and it manages to keep a strong baseline of suspense all the way through, with a few moments of pure fear. On the other hand, in a film that starts off so original it still feels the need to bog down the end result with your standard mesh of clichés and ridiculous contrivances.The first scene where we get a strong sense of the strangers is truly terrifying. Liv Tyler stands in the kitchen in confused fear as a masked man appears in the shadows behind her. He calmly watches as she attempts to calm herself, completely unaware of his presence. It's a frightening scene, but even moreso is the moment which follows, where these strangers finally start breaking down the walls. As brilliant as moments like these can be, I can't seem to get over how insulting some other aspects of the film are.Even as the film opens, it tells us in a laughable voice-over that the events to follow are based on a true story....which is complete bullshit. These events never happened and the filmmakers knew it. They just tried to give it a heightened sense of fear and I couldn't help but grow a strong dislike from that fact. This is followed by two mormon boys arriving at the scene of the crime, after the strangers have left. A laughably absurd police call made by one of the boys is only made more ridiculous by the final moment of the film. The inclusion of the character of Mike is nothing beyond your standard 'here comes another person into the mix, so maybe they'll get saved....but oh no he dies' scene that occurs in just about every modern, clichéd horror film around. It comes off as nothing more than an excuse to waste some time and insult the audience.Unfortunately, my dilemma as to whether or not I liked the film was made into a very quick decision in the final moment, one of the most insulting and utterly absurd finales I've ever come across. In a way, The Strangers is even more insulting than the other clichéd, contrived horror films around because it actually looked like it could have done something new. It's a film that teases the audience with the prospect of originality, and then mocks us for ever dreaming something so foolish.",The Strangers
119,bob_meg,"Uneven, unsatisfying, and ultimately not very scary",7,30 May 2008,"I had high hopes for this relatively low-budget thriller. The set-up seemed creepy enough, the locations and set design realistically sinister and isolating, and the masked invaders were unnerving, even in the well-put-together trailer.Unfortunately, newcomer Brian Bertino is simply not up to the --- admittedly daunting --- task of carrying this movie's simple premise for an hour and forty minutes. It's like he had this terrific idea but no clue how to realize it.The film starts with a thoughtfully slow set-up that never pays out. I understand we need Kristin and Jim, the young couple played by Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman, to do the right amount of wordless emoting, but it's virtually *all* they do. Even with a flashback, we don't get much, if any, information about why their romantic evening has gone awry. Can this all be chalked up to a case of the jitters on Tyler's part? Again, we don't know, and this really inhibits any investment in their characters.After having failed to make us really care about the two protagonists, Bertino doesn't keep the suspense up for any long period of time. Certain scenes really come together --- such as the first siege on the cabin, with the insane hammering at the doors ringing around you as the old phonograph skips and bumps over a creepily cloying tune, and certain scenes just don't (shots fired through doors, while undoubtedly terrifying in real life, don't work so well in the distanced media of film). A lot of the camera work seems cold and detached as well...ordinarily I'm not a huge fan of hand-held camera work, but this movie could actually use more of it.As I sat watching this movie, I couldn't help but think how a veteran horror writer/director like John Carpenter or Wes Craven, for example, might have punched up the action. Everything in ""The Strangers"" feels impersonal and oddly by route --- nothing really happens that you don't expect, even in the end (especially the tacked-on cheesy ending here). Even tomandandy's score (whose work I usually really enjoy) seems lackluster, sluggish, and unoriginal.But again, sustaining suspense for an entire movie is something few debut directors can pull off. The last few movies I can think of that did succeed in this regard were ""High Tension"" and ""Wolf Creek""...even if they were, for all intents and purposes, splatter fests, at least they held you in your seat. ""The Strangers,"" sadly, does not.** Just saw the French thriller ""Them,"" which most people have mentioned is strikingly similar to this film and I must amend my rating. ""The Strangers"" is a virtual remake of that film, which is far creepier, more compellingly acted and plausible. It's one thing to make a bad movie, quite another to virtually plagiarize a good one and then screw it up in the process. Bertino should be sued.",The Strangers
120,ericrnolan,"""The Strangers"" (2008) is yet more evidence that horror movies can be formulaic, yet effective.",8,7 March 2015,"It's strictly by the numbers. Masked psychotics wielding axes and knives terrorize an innocent couple in an isolated location. There are severed phone lines, bad guys appearing out of nowhere behind our protagonists, and even gratuitous underwear shots. There's even a scene in which one character hides in a closet and stares out between the slots of one of those blinds-type doors. Then the predictable happens. Where have we seen all this before? Everywhere.Yet it's still a frightening movie – thanks to some slick directing and camera work. It works. If you want a scary movie, this delivers. There's also some cool cinematography – especially with the use of color in rendering the immense forest around the story's isolated cabin location. Decent fright-flick!There were three criticisms I had of this movie:1) When a deep-voiced male narrator assures us seriously in a prologue that this story ""is based on true events,"" this is a cliché. It was pretty cheesy when it was done in ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" way back in 1974. It also insults our intelligence; we know that claims like these are rarely true.2) I occasionally dislike female characters who become weak and panicky when imperiled. Once you fall in love with Ellen Ripley or Sarah Conner, the portrayal of weepy scream-queens seems vaguely sexist, and these characters are harder to care for and root for. And I have female friends (including a few NRA members) who, although afraid, would probably @#$% a brother up if attacked like this.3) I had the same concern about this movie that I had with ""The Devil's Rejects"" and ""Wolf Creek"" (2005), and it's a little hard to explain  Yes, I really like horror movies. And some of my favorites contain a lot of explicit violence. But there's a very fine line between a decent horror story and a faux snuff film. If we are presented with very little story, and are merely shown innocents being attacked with little hope of recourse  I dunno. It feels gratuitous. I'm no Puritan when it comes to violent content. But if that's ALL there is, I feel guilty in a way. (Am I a psycho or voyeur for viewing this?) I feel  ""healthier"" if I am watching a movie that contains violence, but allows the good guys at least a CHANCE to fight back and maybe even prevail. (Think ""Aliens"" (1986) or ""28 Days Later"" (2002).)All in all, though, this was a good movie.",The Strangers

Well into the early hours they try and make up, but their plans are put on hold by three masked wearing assailants that come calling. Unusually slow to get going for this kind of film, it never the less rises above such average fodder with some decent scares and some unsettling moments, as the unwanted guests play cat and mouse with them, the fact that its supposed to be based on the events makes it all the more scary. As James says at one point ""why would they do this,"" indeed its hard to fathom why anyone would go to such lengths to terrorize and toy with their victims so much, but maybe its just because they can.

There is no plot, no character development, no dialog(well, very little at least) and the worst part is that there is no suspense or gore.

So for those who like to see genres ""pushed"", this will be tired and hackneyed. BUT, for those who ENJOY the horror / gore genre for what it is, this story delivers with a vengeance.The first feature by Director, 31 year old Bryan Bertino,it carefully and skilfully deploys all the ""tricks"" required to make for a genuinely scary experience, and at 85 minutes the running time is only fractionally too long. However this is not a criticism, as an hour and a bit is about all you are going to get from a modest house besieged by masked assailants.Liv Tyler plays the terrorised Kristen McKay with conviction and style. Sadly the only missing staple from such a film, the bare breasts shot, is missing! Her boyfriend James Hoyt, played by Scott Speedman, is well cast as the male incapable of preventing ""bad things"" happening to both of them.Essentially this is a story that plays on our fears of ""things that go bump in the night"", literally, and works very effectively as such.The opening advice that the story ""was inspired by true events"" was a little unnecessary, especially as there was no coda at the end to offer further explanation.Neverteless a fine debut offering from a director who will certainly deliver more, and better, as his career unfolds.My 8/10 rating reflects its position within the genre - not out of ""all comers"".",The Strangers

127,Coffee_in_the_Clink,Brutal and heavy. Excellent lighting complements the cinematography - and the terror - so well,9,6 May 2021,"""The Strangers"" was a welcome break from the 'torture porn' that was doing the rounds in the noughties following the success of ""Saw"" and the even greater appeal of ""Hostel"". I absolutely loved ""The Strangers"" when it first came out, but ever since then I have seen ""Them"" (2005 French horror film, very similar plot) and have become familiar with a few other home-invasion horrors released well before Bertino wrote his script for ""The Strangers"". Which is to say that I may have been a bit pessimistic of my appreciation for this film back in the day. But upon viewing it for the second time last night, over ten years later, I can say that I need not have been pessimistic about my initial holding-it-on-a-pedestal reaction on my first viewing; ""The Strangers"" is in my mind one of the best horror films of the decade.Bertino pulls no punches here and is a master at the helm. He knows it all, and you know that he has seen it all, from Hitchcock to Carpenter and in that respect he knows how to do suspense. He commands a scene so well; just look at the scene where Liv Tyler stands in the kitchen and a masked figure appears from the shadows in the background and watches her for a moment. That is a superb scene. I found that the lighting really helps this film. Once the terror starts the scenes are washed in a faint-orange glow as only a few lamps are on in the house. The assailants are terrifying not only in their appearance but in their motives. ""Why are you doing this to us?"" one of their victims screams. ""Because you're home,"" one replies, all but shrugging her shoulders at such a ridiculous question. Like many great horrors before it, ""The Strangers"" suggests that evil is incarnate in the everyday and can strike anywhere, anytime. It does not wear a cape or live in a castle surrounded by werewolves, it is driving through suburbia and outside your home now, as the opening shots suggest as we view a row of houses from a moving car.",The Strangers
128,Rendanlovell,Bleak but generic,5,8 May 2020,"Often quite dull and repetitive. Up until the very bleak ending this can't get more generic. Under written characters, annoying jumpscares, and lame plot devices. The whole movie it's obvious the Strangers are just toying with these people just because they felt like it but I can't say that makes for a compelling watch. I'll be honest, I think I like the 2nd one better (I know I'm probably alone in this).It feels more inspired, more focused even. That one us clearly rooted in 70s slasher films with snap zooms, campy music, and over the top characters. This has elements of that same tone but not in any interesting or fun ways. Yeah the second one is way more goofy but at least I wasn't actively cheering against the boring leads.

129,CountJonnie,"Begins sharp, ends flawed",6,18 September 2017,"The director already told the audience the biggest spoiler, namely that it was based on the idea of crimes happening for no apparent reason or explanation. That could work, if there was some enigma or monster that is so captivating, that you can accept that it exists for the sake of existing. Like Michael Meyers.The movie succeeds in not giving away too much, and building up tension in the first 10, 20 or 30 minutes. With limited information and good acting from especially Liv Tyler, you can feel the terror from an enemy that has no face or no voice. Unfortunately, you get nothing else.Again, it would've worked if there was some entity or enigma, that could help you relate the killer to some emotion or metaphor. Killers are often metaphors for growing up, childhood fears, jealousy and sex. Not only are those reasons absent here, they make it too obvious those are absent after the few spoken words from the attackers. At that moment the exciting first half is way over, and the last half is just repeating itself.

Nothing really out of the ordinary from horror movie standpoint. I noticed the trend of having some sort of religious Christians in this film that I have seen in many other horror movies. Instead of spotting Alfred Hitchcock , you spot a religious Christian or 2. I do not understand why many of these horror/thriller movies feel they have to do that but they do. Nothing against anyones religion. I am just pointing out the cliché. There were other clichés as well , such as shooting the wrong person and a car being slammed by a pickup truck , which leads to other clichés of 'rednecks' doing the dirty deed.I felt the acting lacked and quite frankly the bad people reminded me more of the prop actor types you find in one of those touristy haunted houses or Halloweenfest aka House of Horrors. Very lackadaisical acting from most of the actors. This was more of a psychological thriller type of film but never really achieved what , I believe the writers wanted it to do ... That being keeping the churn in your stomach the whole movie or at least most of the movie. Once the churn was gone the roller-coaster was just coasting on level ground for the last half of the movie.

132,dommercaldi,"It Manages To Initially Create A Tense Atmosphere, But Devolves Into A Typical Jump-scare Fest",4,6 July 2021,"Pros:
1. The opening narration helps to create an atmosphere of foreboding and uneasiness by grounding the film in reality by reminding the audience that this story isn't entirely fictitious.2. The implementation of wide shots gives the feeling that the protagonists are constantly being watched, thus adding to the horror, as well as perfectly complimenting the home invasion scenario.3. There's good build-up of tension and suspense via appropriately placed loud noises and brief sightings of the killers.4. The sound design is excellent as in order to increase the tension and fear, the everyday sounds dim, whilst the particular sounds being used to scare the characters and audience get louder.5. The ambiguity of the killers and their motives stays intact, for the most part, and this increases their fear factor as they're incomprehensible.6. When Kristen McKay (Live Tyler) and James Hoyt (Scott Speedman) get murdered, the unwavering close-ups make you feel every stab.Cons:
1. Kristen McKay and James Hoyt at the beginning are presented as dysfunctional because of a failed marriage proposal, but other than the beginning, very little attention is given to this which ultimately makes it a useless plot point as it adds nothing to the story.2. The obtuse score immediately starts up whenever a supposed scary moment is about to arrive which leads to the eventual scare being weakened in its impact.3. Most of the jump-scares are poorly placed to elicit cheap scares, and they fail all the time.4. Somehow Kristen McKay survives the ordeal. This was clearly done to provide a cheap jump-scare, in addition to setting up a needless sequel.5. Bizarrely, Dollface (Gemma Ward), Pin-Up Girl (Laura Margolis) and Man in Mask (Kip Weeks) are able to move around ridiculously fast without making sounds.6. When Dollface utters the killers' 'reason' for the attack: ""Because you were home"", it comes across as unintentionally cheesy, it ruins the ambiguity slightly because now we know their 'motivation', and it leaves a rather disappointing taste in the mouth because the murders are confirmed as pointless killings.",The Strangers
133,Jacques98,A breath of fresh air.,6,13 September 2008,"The only thing that makes this different from being a sad cliché is the nihilism, the lack of a story, and the lack of characterization.No, I'm not being sarcastic.Having no plot rarely works - but it's always better than turning to a deep cliché story we've heard a hundred times. Same with flat characterization. So when it doubt, leave all lame storytelling elements out. And it works for this movie.The lack of deep meaning also makes it anti-cliché. The ""killers"" don't care who they mentally torture. Can you name the last time you saw a movie that used that idea? I can name a few, but they're by far the minority.Overall, I'm more impressed with it than I have been with a horror movie in about 2 years. Unlike the horridly cliché movies like The Decent and The Orphanage, this didn't get critical acclaim. Why?

Honey, you can actually dial 911 WHILE the phone is charging, you don't have to wait fifteen minutes.

For a while there, Bertino holds a line of suspense and manages to push it to limits Hitchcock would have been proud of, it just freaks me out, it's silent, psychological suspense horror when it's at it's classiest. Then boom there's a man with a mask in the window, sort of a gimmicky boogeyman perhaps trying to become a ""cult character"" like Leatherface or something, and the suspense is just gone. I breathe out and there's nothing left because after that, James returns and starts doing the one stupid thing after the other and the people terrorizing them can have a field day, since our two main characters try their best to put themselves in grave danger.The unknown invading the zone of domestic safety is a common theme in the horror genre. Or actually, it's really what just about every horror movie is about, but this theme of breaking into the middle-class innocence naturally makes one think of superior films from the 1970's, like Wes Craven's true nightmare Last House on the Left (1972) or his less great but equally important The Hills Have Eyes (1977), and Bertino obviously pays these films a great homage in his debut. But just like Eli Roth's Cabin Fever (2003), the Saw-movies or any other overrated horror film from this decade, he doesn't simply wink at these movies, he uses their structure and duplicates them. It's more or less a rip-off, with the Leatherface-clone I mentioned for instance. It even becomes a problem for Bertino to keep the movie contemporary, it's supposed to take place in modern time but Liv Tyler is dressed up in a flannel shirt and dances around to the country music from her vinyl player. She looks like Laura Prepon, the girl from That 70's Show, and the style becomes just as contrived.Another huge problem is also how far-fetched the premise of the story becomes, after a while. When you think about it, these outdoor terrorists aren't actually posing any obvious threat to these people, yet they act totally outsmarted and depressed upon everything they do (they write nasty words on the windows, they smash the car up, oh noo THEY PUT ON THE RECORD PLAYER!!). There is a shotgun in the house. As far as I can see, initially, these people aren't even armed. Why not just go out there and shoot them?! I'm no gun spokesman but even I would think that's reasonable! Eventually, it's just Liv Tyler crawling around pathetically defenseless and the last bit of the movie is a boring stretch that leads to the natural, nihilistic-by-numbers-ending that was given in the beginning. Yeah, that's right, we already know in the first minute how this is going to end, but to make the movie even more pointless and unexciting we have to sit through the unlikely story of how two people, who are more defenseless than two old ladies in a barbershop, naturally gets it. ""Next time it will be easier"" the killers say towards the end. Easier? Who are you going to go after, some guy in a coma? Yeah, easier alright, just pull the plug. Like I wanted to do with this movie.",The Strangers
137,TheRedDeath30,Effective and Frightening Invasion Horror,9,22 August 2015,"There is a lot of love and, on the opposite end of the spectrum, a lot of hate for this movie. I can be a hater myself, now and then, and I've written plenty of them here, but I don't understand it for this movie. I, honestly, feel that this is an excellent example of how to do the ""invasion horror"" genre the right way.Many who hate on this movie will point to European counterparts like FUNNY GAMES or THEM as superior examples and I would agree that those films to some things better, but as a whole I find this movie far more entertaining and frightening. The other hate that is typically spewed on this movie is the irrational and unintelligent actions of the two main characters, who many feel don't do enough to save themselves from their predicament To this, I would only naively argue that it's just a horror movie. If you are looking for more explanation and exploration, then this probably isn't for you. Accept that most horror films use similar patterns and move on.I think what this film does best is to terrorize its' audience. One of the facets that I see other reviewers complain about that I feel is one of the best used techniques is the abundance of shots where the viewer sees the danger, but the character doesn't. I've seem some argue that this is pointless in the film. If the character's aren't seeing the villain behind them, it's not adding ""valid fear"". I would counter that this isn't meant to scare the characters. This movie will stick with you long after your first viewing and the reason is those excellent shots of villains lingering just out of shot, or two steps behind the character completely unaware, even the moving of objects in the house. These shots play with out basic human fears. They invade our sense of security and cause us to question how safe we are in those ""safe places"". It is the effect this creates in the viewer that makes this movie so powerful and the reason that many find it terrifying.I find the introduction well-done. We don't get a lot of background on the characters, which is fine with me, because instead we get an in-depth look at a emotionally draining event for our characters that leaves them in no state to deal with the physical traumas that will be coming. I think that Speedman and Tyler do a good job in these scenes of conveying naturalistic dialog that helps make this successful.The score is also a key element. It knows when to maintain a sense of quiet foreboding. There is a deft hand in the sparse use of score and sound to create maximum impact, blending it with a soundtrack of music that is created naturally through the turntable in the movie, of course using the skipping record to unnerving effect.I'm not a big fan of slick 90s and 00s horror, but this is a movie that is well worth its' popularity, in my opinion, and one of the best horror films using the home invasion plot.",The Strangers

What should have been an idyll to sort matters out turns into a nightmare unearthed from the bowels of hell. Using dark overtones and an eerie sense of atmosphere the film gradually conveys the impending inevitability of doom and the horror that occurs. Unexpected crashes, jarring sounds, jolt scares and creepy music all add up to the claustrophobia of fright. While slow going in parts the decent acting and chilling, unsettling nature of the film will certainly unnerve and impress.

I've seen a number of movies in the last two years and nearly every horror film has gotten under my skin and penetrated my mind.After the first ten minutes of this movie, my heart raced for the rest of the 75 minutes. Liv Tyler can surprise you sometimes and pushes herself to the max in this. Her performance is her most powerful yet! I was so terrified throughout this movie.It's anticipation and mystery keeps you on edge and it tingles your neck. I had shivers and jumped at a number of climatic scenes. It's not your normal horror/thriller. It's so much more. It's one flaw is that it's a lot similar to Vacancy. It's differences are that this is not set at a motel but a private home. This one is also based off true events.I think the ""inspired by true events"" is the thing that freaks me out the most. It's very eerie and quiet throughout which just runs your blood that much colder. It's very dark and it's ideal to watch in darkness. You will really get into the feeling and skin of the characters and feel their fear.I recommend this to all audiences. Watch it with someone though.",The Strangers

But it played things ridiculously down the middle, delivering the textbook definition of the genre. While it's initially disappointing to notice the total lack of ingenuity, you can grow to appreciate the economical film making. Not wasting time on frivolous things like character development or plot depth, the movie offers an undiluted slab of tension building and jump scares. It's competently crafted and can be genuinely effective if you let yourself get wrapped up in it, as long as you don't focus on the extremely rote premise at it's core.",The Strangers

145,dschmeding,A total waste of precious time,1,19 August 2008,"Are you kidding me?? Who the hell gives a movie like ""The strangers"" an 7 point average rating?? Sure, this movie gives you some suspense and some scares... its pretty slow and you think something evil is coming up ...but its not. Basically nothing is coming up To sum this movie up... couple had a bad evening because the girl turned down a proposal, they go home to a house far out without anyone near (perfect setting for a horror movie... duh!) and soon a strange girl stands in front of the door. Now you see a couple of strange people with masks walking in the dark, appearing behind the scared couple and disappearing like ghosts. About 60 Minutes of barely anything but this happening... messages written on windows, knocking on doors, playing records and leaving signs of having been there to mess with the couple who obviously are as dumb as they can get in movies like this. The guy shoots his own friend (pretty old one), the girl runs barefoot and breaks her ankle (remember this from some other movie?), no one runs out into the dark forest to hide or flee but they rather stay in their house without phones. They got a gun and loads of ammo but are obviously too damn stupid to use a gun on 3 unarmed mask wearing bogeymen. I expected this to make me angry when I looked at the playing time of 70 minutes and still nothing happened. Most of the movie is just cheap suspense and when they finally get the couple they stand around like they are high (considering this I wondered how they managed to appear/disappear on endless plains within seconds in other parts of the movie), drop their masks without the viewer seeing their faces and stab the couple... Oh, I am sorry for the spoiler. But it gets even better... the 3 dope smoking mask-freaks drive off in their car, get a brochure from 2 Christian boys and exactly those find the aftermath of the night. When touching the dead girl she wakes up and delivers another horror cliché with a cheap scare screaming at the camera to release you from this boredom with rolling credits. Come on... I'd like to beat the whole team over the head with a baseball bat. Delivering cheap scares in slow-motion pace (someone here called this a fact paced movie... thats kind of funny!) and then crunching in some eerie scenes (you know all of them from the trailer) without meaning, adding lines like ""We did it because you are home"" and ""Next time it will be easier"" as the only thing uttered by the killers and leaving you with a cheap ending like this ... this movie is a damn joke! So don't fall for anyone who compares this to psychological movies like Shining. ""The strangers"" is like a cheap tunnel of horror ride annoying you with every dumb cliché you can imagine. Being locked in a dark wardrobe with your screaming girlfriend is way scarier than watching this cheap excuse of a movie.",The Strangers
146,Mr_Censored,"2/3 Brilliance, 1/3 Pedestrian.",7,29 December 2008,"Without overly praising the film too much, it needs to be said that it's been a long time since a horror movie went for genuine suspense and pulled it off as wonderfully as ""The Strangers"" has done. It's hard to get excited when it comes to newer horror movies, especially when you stop and realize that just about anything you could do has been done already. For all the ""Saws"" and ""Hostels"" there is a ""Ring"" or a ""Grudge"" but none of them have that same effect that old-school horror has, to attack the very basic senses of it's audience, rather than try to disgust them or confuse them with out-of-this-world imagery. Maybe that's why ""The Strangers"" works. First-time director Bryan Bertino seems to understand that it's impossible to re-invent the wheel at this stage in the game, therefore, it's okay to embrace convention. While doing this, he engages his audience in a very simple story, with very real and very flawed characters who find themselves in an everyday-situation that leads to horrific events that are perfectly reasonable and not out of the realm of possibility.Yes, parts of it are clichéd, and yes, it does borrow heavily from the original ""Halloween"" but it works well. ""The Strangers"" is a well-oiled thrill-ride, wrapping itself up in under an hour and a half and leaving you with an unsettled feeling in your stomach. Bertino shows shocking proficiency at conjuring up some stirring images, and it's all driven home by a striking lack of music. Complete silence is disrupted by loud thuds that send shivers down the spine. The audio is almost as disturbing as the visuals, which are lacking in gore by today's standards, but only serve to drive home the realistic nature of the film. Too bad, then, that the ending cheapens everything. Without giving much of anything away, the ending seems unfinished. The movie spends the first two acts building up an unbelievable amount of tension and expectations, and the way it all ends is a bit flat and, well, uninteresting. What starts off as a horror classic unfortunately unravels at the end. Perhaps that's a testament to the effect of the film, though, that the ending can't possibly match what so much of the film has established. Just how do you end a movie that has scared it's characters and it's audience into a corner? I don't know how it could have ended any differently, and I suppose that's just another instance in the film that is true to life. There are no happy endings, and nothing ever wraps itself up all nice and neat.",The Strangers
147,dormesher-21565,"""Because your were home""",9,5 June 2021,The Strangers. A brilliantly made Home Invasion Horror movie inspired by real events which has a great story and interesting killers.The movie builds tension throughout the entire runtime and keeps you on the edge of your seat while giving you a brilliant scare along the way.The story in this one is really well handled with just two normal people staying away for the weekend getting traumatised by three killers its a great story which has a realistic atmosphere to It unlike some horror movies that I'm a fan of and that really helps the tone of this movie.We also get a little backstory at the beginning with the characters and what led them to staying at the location and that's really well handled as well.The killers are interesting and very creepy in my opinion and the fact that we never hear them speak for most of the movie really adds to the tone and creep factor of the movie.They also keep knocking on the door each time to traumatise the main characters and every time you hear that knock it sends shiveres down your spine.The ending is also really great in my opinion and I love how it leaves it open for a sequel and the way one of the killers says it will be easier next time leaves the movie with such a weird atmosphere and i really like that.The only issues I have with the movie are the first 20 minutes are a little slow but once you hear the first knock at the door your on edge and its great.I also feel like the movie loses some of its tension during the second act with one of the main characters crawling back and forth to a barn it becomes a little predictable and loses some of the atmosphere of the film but its nothing that ruins the movie in my opinion.Verdict 9/10 a fantastic horror home invasion movie and one of my favourite horror movies the tension building is fantastic and really creepy and something that reminds me of a John Carpenter film some minor pacing issues in the first 20 minutes and it does become a little predictable in the second act but this is still a classic for horror fans in my opinion.,The Strangers

Unfortunately, they're the unwitting victims of three deranged people who torment, stalk, and eventually attack them just because they were home.This movie was freaky in the sense that things like this happen. People commit random acts of violence, apparently for no reason, and that means no one is immune to such attacks. The majority of the film is the strangers stalking James and Kristen, combining eerie music (and sometimes no music at all), with sounds and noises. But then the ending came, and it was a huge letdown. Up until the ending I liked the film, but then the ending came and I was disappointed.",The Strangers
150,jp281995,Suspenseful But Fails on Other Aspects,5,12 January 2018,"It's wrong for me to watch this at night with the lights off and the windows open. The story is frightening, mainly because the story is realistic. It's one of human's biggest fears: to be invaded. That's why locks are invented.The story starts uninteresting. After a wedding reception they attended, a beautiful couple goes home, located at the middle of nowhere. Some dialogues here and there, flashbacks on why they're both upset. And then the tension starts with a knock, Liv Tyler's character is alone, she's vulnerable and frightened. You can feel the suspense, the tension, your heart racing because of the unknown.That's it, it's pretty suspenseful, really. On other aspects, this film is average. The characterization is not very good, but then, in movies like this, the filmmakers do not give much thought about characters as they focus more on the suspense and frightening parts. The story is too simple and quite unimaginative. Yes, it's suspenseful, especially at the beginning. But that's it. No ""I didn't see that coming"" moments. There are also overused elements in horror films that are used here, especially at the climax scenes, making the movie quite predictable and tiresome at some parts. The ending is not very good.Well, I can say that The Strangers did not fail to terrify me, at least for a while. But it's not really a memorable one.

151,freaky_dave,Great direction but poor storyline hurts the movie,6,24 June 2008,"I just finished watching the Strangers. It took me a few weeks, but I finally got to see it. I was impressed with the direction and the acting. Liv Tyler is much better in this movie then THe Incredible Hulk which came out a week later. Scott Speedman wasn't bad either, but there was no real storyline to connect the movie in anyway. It's just a random happening that is sort of explained in the beginning, but nothing more.A young couple, their relationship on the rocks, goes to and isolated house. WHile there they are at first accosted by a young girl at the door, and then that incident builds in to something much more terrifying. THe director Bryan Bertino is excellent with directing the movie and setting his pieces up perfectly. THe tension is remarkably well done and the terror only grips you farther as the movie goes on. However, I felt as if this movie was missing something more important, and that was a basic storyline to go with the terrifying premise. THere were no reasons behind the actions taken by the villains. I guess I was okay with that and thought maybe the movie would go more into a psychological premise involving the two leads because of there rocky relationship, but it never takes it to that level either. WHat I mean is that though this movie plays tricks with your mind, it is never quite satisfying because something more is missing. Not a twist per say, but an idea that the three masked villains were not simply random, but more than just that. I think that would've made this movie work much better. We could've also done without the final scene in the movie as well.THere were many things I liked about THe Strangers, but I guess maybe I was expecting something more than what I got. I wasn't totally disappointed with this movie, but I think it could've been oh so much better.",The Strangers
152,clintstevens,It Could Have Been So Much More,3,21 August 2018,"With Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman it should have been a great flick. What started off to be a good slasher type movie petered out about halfway through. The beginning reminded me of 50's film noir, with minimal dialog and a slow lead-up to what you knew was not going to be good for the two main characters. Unfortunately, the film devolved into typical 'where are the psychos?' and 'what will they do to the hapless couple by the end?' melodrama. There was no rhyme or reason as to why the three killers choose the house and the couple to do their dastardly deeds. Indeed, when Liv Tyler asks ""Why are you doing this to us?"" their response is ""Because you were home.""Think of this picture as a fancy feast...a delicious salad and tasty soup followed by baloney sandwiches. It could have been so much more, but unfortunately, it leaves one hungry for something more substantial.",The Strangers

Director Bryan Bertino is a man who knows the power of out-of-context music. He knows the power of the sudden noise in the silence. He knows the power of the glimpse of something just outside of your field of vision.By modern standards ""The Strangers"" is a short movie (85 minutes), but Bryan Bertino wisely takes his time and allows us to get to know young couple Liv Tyler (a really great performance from her) and Scott Speedman, their fears and their problems.

154,mr_popcorn,The Strangers,6,19 October 2008,"""Lock the door. Pretend you're safe."" A suburban couple returning to their semi-secluded house after attending a wedding finds their lives suddenly thrown into chaos with the arrival of three malevolent, masked strangers in director Bryan Bertino's tense tale of survival. Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman star as the couple forced to resort to violence they never thought themselves capable of as they struggle for their lives, and model-turned-actress Gemma Ward continues her transition from the catwalk to the silver screen as one of the merciless masked invaders.Review The Strangers has its fair share of continuity errors and borderline ridiculous horror scenarios as the two aggravated victims almost, in all their power, tried not to survive. I mean seriously, there are three masked assailants, two of them are skinny creepy little girls and the other is a man almost half the size of the protagonist and all they got is an axe and a couple of butter knives whilst the heroes of the movie wields a pump action shotgun. Really? My 5 year old niece can protect himself if in case this happens to him and yet the protagonists were overpowered by the three stooges.At the very least however, I was impressed by Liv Tyler. Her chilling performance and that horrifying scream...wow, no wonder she got tonsillitis while making this, she gave her all but still the material is just so-so and sadly, she's the only thing that shines in this above average horror flick. The Strangers starts out strong, a little backstory there, creepy little woman asking for ""Tamara"" here and it gives off good vibes. The middle act just falls flat as the unlucky couple gets man handled by the three stooges, I almost fell asleep but what kept me awake for this part of film is Liv Tyler's bone chilling scream. The conclusion of the film is rather disturbing while not at all being that gory and I find it pretty impressive, the ending will shock you down to the core as the unlucky couple meets their grim fate. I would've given this a much lower score but the ending is just too disturbingly amazing. I can't resist.",The Strangers

157,moutonbear25,"The Strangers ... Sharp, Subtle, Surprising",8,1 June 2008,"Before writer/director, Bryan Bertino's debut film, THE STRANGERS commences, a peculiar voice narrates the text that appears on the screen. Apparently, there have been over 1.4 million violent crimes investigated by the FBI. It isn't clear whether James Hoyt and Kristen McKay's story is inspired by one particular real event - whether these two individuals that we are about to watch be mentally and physically tormented for hours in fact existed in real life, or whether this story is just an amalgamation of many horrifically tragic experiences all smashed into one for dramatic effect. Either way, the vague implication that this may have actually taken place is essentially unnecessary as the situation these two innocents find themselves in would have been frightening one way or the other.I don't remember the last time I saw a ""scary"" movie. I tend to avoid them as I don't need anything else in my life to disrupt my sleep and it has also been my experience that the majority of these films are rushed efforts that rely on quick and easy startles to satisfy the crowd. Though some of these expected thrills give THE STRANGERS some of its more jumpy moments, it is the underlying randomness of the events that keep the uneasy tone lingering long after its close. Having returned home from a disappointing and potentially devastating evening, troubled couple, Hoyt & McKay (Scott Speedman and Liv Tyler) realize that they don't know each other as well as they thought they did. The strangers sharing a bed in the secluded Hoyt summer home needn't fear each other though as much as the strangers lurking in the surrounding woods. Finding themselves in a position that would drive anyone to panic, the two go between the offensive and the defensive, as well as inside and outside the home. Just like the fright flicks I remember, these two make decisions that seem utterly ridiculous while I sit safely watching from afar, which only drives my panic higher and my hands tighter over my eyes. It is Bertino's subtle and oddly gentle style that makes THE STRANGERS such an effective experience. Strange sounds seem to be coming from everywhere and nowhere all at once while the sinister trio of masked tormentors ominously appear from and disappear into the shadows at random intervals. They don't know when or from where the next scream will come from and that is the last thing you need when you think you're in the safety of your own home. By attacking the audience's basest of fears, Bertino has simplified the genre. He has crafted a thriller that isn't bogged down in explaining the face of evil or concerned with upping the gore factor. Subsequently, there's a lot more time left over to just scare the crap out of everyone.",The Strangers
158,DustinRahksi,A snooze fest.,2,6 January 2013,"The first time I watched this film I kept flipping through the channels because I found it so boring. Every time I returned to the channel it's like 'oh nothing happened', and I'd flip the channel again. My first consensus was it sucked. A couple years later guess what my dumb ass did, I bought it. I watched it and it still sucked. And take note there is an unrated edition, that you can't tell the difference from the theatrical. And what was so bad that needed to be edited out, there was only one mildly bloody death. The characters were garbage, uninspired and boring, pretty much whimpering cowards. I hate to say it but I would have rather seen some stupid kids instead. This film checks off all the clichéd ideas there are. The characters were very stupid, in fact they were so stupid it didn't matter if they died, natural selection if you will. The only people that could find this scary are six year old's, but they would probably be to bored to even be paying attention. This film is meant to be serious, but it is just so bad I don't care and just want it to be over with. This is one film that I will never watch again, it will just collect dust on the shelf, but it should be in the trash. Overall this film should have never been made, it's not suspenseful or scary, so it fails at being a horror film, it was pretty much just made to make a little money.

159,FKDZ,Well done thriller.,5,26 August 2021,"Overall I didn't have the highest expectations going into this movie, expecting more of a slasher. But it wasn't that. It's a slow but well paced thriller.The directing is great imo, and used a lot of elements you would expect to see but aren't too obvious or overused. The movie also looks pretty good in general, though very dark. So mind that.The acting is pretty good, I didn't like how they edited the female lead's screaming and made is much too loud. And there was a moment where it was a bit awkward or cheesy when she screamed off screen. Not the actresses fault though.The editing.. I felt was lacking, like the example I gave just then. It's too leans to much on using loud jump scares. Because it's a thriller I understand the need for it as nothing else really happens.. but it just gets dull very quickly.The script is just... there. It really is just a idea ''what if killer strangers came to your house at night'' and that's what the movie goes with.In general I thought this was a good thriller though. Not so much a traditional horror. It was a bit slower than I'd liked and the finale was lackluster to say the least. But it was okay overall.",The Strangers

I have to admit that it wasn't scary, but it was more creepy. Also, I'm surprised that there weren't many jumpscares. The killcount was horrible, in my opinion the kills were so lame. The plot twist wasn't that big deal, I mean I wasn't shocked. It was just ok.

162,The_Orenda,Eerie film lacking substance but delivers the thrills.,5,31 May 2008,"If The Strangers had a story with a little bit more common sense, I would fully recommend you in going to see Liv Tyler running, crawling, limping around for her life in and around a sprawling bungalow while three strangers invade the house. She needs an explanation why all these bad guys are doing this to her. ""Because you were home,"" is all she's going to get.There's a specific scene in this film, when the first knock on the door came, and a girl is standing in darkness (the outdoor light-bulb loosened), asking if Tamara was home. One could not help think but of Charles Manson when he was asking for someone of a different name at 10050 Cielo Drive and Shahrokh Hatami, with Sharon Tate behind him, might have said something similar to what James was telling the mysterious girl. As far as anything else being inspired by true events, is left to our imagination I guess, but it's hard to say if the 'Man in the Mask' is directly inspired by Tex Watson and the two girls, 'Pin-Up Girl' and 'Dollface,' are Susan Atkins and Patricia Krenwinkel.As far as the film is, would you like it? The Strangers is indeed a scary movie at times. The film transcends most of the others in its genre by its 'less is more' and the villains do not cut corners when they decide to 'jump' out at you. Bertino's first effort in filming is a brave one as he wisely bucks the trend in making a clone of Saw or Hostel.But the story still sucks. I'm reminded of The Simpsons' 'Cape Fear' episode where Sideshow Bob goes through a heck of a lot of time and trouble simply to stab or slice Bart. The Strangers do spend a lot of time destroying any point of hope for poor James and Kristen, not to mention one particular brain-fart where James decides to leave for help, abandoning poor Kristen in the house where the Strangers could be anywhere.And what would The Strangers be if Liv Tyler wasn't such an excellent actress? The film's opening begins on a depressing note and seeing Scott Speedman and Liv work the crummy script shows how lucky Bryan Bertino was to get actors who did their best through it. And when the Strangers invade, seeing poor Liv in fear was as convincing as you could get. She did a superb job! The Strangers is not for everyone. And it does not change the status quo for horror movies because of its terrible script. But it is entertaining and Bertino's first effort as a director proves that he has potential.",The Strangers
163,utahman1971,Not mormons in this!,3,29 September 2009,"I did not like it that much myself. I got the DVD and watched it. Very slow paced through the whole thing. It was just boring through out the whole movie. Just because there was loud noises from the front door and footsteps coming from around the house. Just because there is not any gore does not make the movie better.I hate to burst the peoples bubble that said those were mormons at the end of the movie that handed the brochures, they just do not know who mormons really are like me. I went on a mission and you have to be 19 to go. Those kids were not even close to 19. They would have to be midgets if they were. Those brochures were not even from L.D.S. church. How lame is it that people just say crap about another religion when they don't even know who they are or what they do? The stupid rumors of religion just makes its way and falsely accused of things never done. Just because they dressed up in white shirts and slacks makes them mormons. How stupid is that. They did not even have the badges on the pocket like mormon missionaries. They were not wearing ties like the requirement to always wear all the time. They have to wear ties no matter how hot it got. It just drives me nuts to see that people make up all this none sense about things just because someone they knew told them that certain religions do certain things and then just say crap because they believe every single thing that comes out of every living persons mouth. Its is just dang stupid just to hear that crap. Sorry, if you expect me as an L.D.S. member to be this rude to others, but damn that person saying that another church is another with out the knowledge of the truth of what church it is, is just plain dumb to me. I will not make accusations about others unless I research the truth. So get a life before making another mormon comment like that. That is why people like that are not welcomed into a nice friendship with people is because of lame comments of someone that is not who they know they are and start rumors.

There's the plot. Like the recent ""Vacancy,"" a horror film does not need much more than that.The film builds a lot of tension and, for the most part, avoids jump-in-your-seat scare tactics. If you are expecting torture and gore in the line of ""Hostel,"" you won't really find it. Are the silent, mask-wearing villains sinister? Yes, at times they are. But what actually gives the film its effect is not so much its goings on as its conclusion, which is depressing, hopeless, and contains no redeeming value.What I mean by no redeeming value is that the kind of final ""tie in"" most of us have come to expect by the end of a movie (""Ah, so that was the villain's motivation"") never comes. All the horror visited upon the hapless couple is unexplained, as if it came from a dark void in the human character. What I dislike about this is that it implies this darkness is somehow inherent, and merely to be accepted at face value. Save for the cases of a few highly disturbed individuals capable of something like that (i.e. Ted Bundy), I do not think most people will find this assumption realistic.But hey, it's only a horror film, right? We watch it to laugh at the ""plot holes"" (don't you know pointing out a horror film's logical ""inconsistencies"" makes you a genius?!) and shake our heads in obnoxious smugness when a character runs in the ""wrong"" direction. Better yet, let us simply laugh out loud at the most harrowing displays of human suffering because we are too immature to enjoy the film for what it is--to let it do its job without interfering because we're too busy trying to bolster a non-existent American ego at the expense of a film.People at my theatre laughed as well, but that had more to do with the general character of the audience than with the movie itself. The movie is, indeed, frightening, albeit leaves one distraught and unsatisfied. But is it frightening enough to be a masterpiece? I would hesitate to compare it to the likes of certain other classics.""The Strangers"" is a good horror film, done in classic style (no moron teenagers, sex-crazed teen whores, happy-go-lucky interracial gatherings of high school friends, alternarock soundtracks or contrived plot twists) which, save for its depressing conclusion about human nature, works well. Viewers who enjoy this will also enjoy ""Vacancy,"" ""Cabin Fever,"" and the ""Hostel"" films.Now on we go to the hordes of intellectual midgets who will point out why this movie was either a) ""funny,"" b) illogical or c) ""the best, sickest, coolest movie ever.""",The Strangers

First, we get to know this couple that has some issues, played by Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman. Both actors do a great job, the acting is pretty solid. Like I said, suspense is built throughout the movie, but it ultimately leads to nothing. Nothing really big happens in the movie, things just kind of unfold. After the first half of the movie, you kind of realize that this is just going nowhere. There are a few jump scares in the movie, but they are mostly earned and executed well, most of them at least. The movie does suffer from the old ""now you see me, (camera shows another angle, then goes back to the first one) now you don't"" and this is used many times.Ultimately I kind of enjoyed the performances in The Strangers and the suspense, but nothing really happens and, although it is brutal, it still feels like a bland experience overall.",The Strangers

My most memorable, movie moment of ""The Strangers"" is the scene when Speedman finally locates a shotgun and shotshells, enough to kill an army of strangers. But — and here is why this movie gets a low grade — Tyler and Speedman make one stupid move after another. It's as if they suddenly got stupid and decided to do everything wrong. Were the characters that stupid, or was the writer/director not a very good screenwriter? I choose the latter. A few well set-up scares saved ""The Strangers"" from getting a much lower grade.

170,billion_mucks,Nihilism A la Carte,8,1 October 2008,"I seem to be approaching nihilist films on a streak, viewing ""The Virgin Spring"" recently. The Strangers has a lot of that ""philosophy"" crammed in. I read comments claiming the film doesn't connect us to the characters, and is crammed of every cliché to be. Oh the irony. When we see horror films, being attached to characters is a repeated figure, a screenwriter's must. Bertino does good in creating the night horror without any development, no overbearing crudeness, playing suspense and psychological terror like piano keys.This is the approach: the strangers attack because their victims ""are at home"", and they do not respond to pleas, long reasonings or emotions. It's nihilism pure: they kill because they find control and domination powerful, and they don't care about consequences, moral or of any other kind.In that optic, ""The Strangers"" is truly scary. We are not dealing with supernatural beings, but human beings, who chose the path of downright evil and can't be convinced of not doing it. People like that may be lurking out there, and that scares most of us viewers.",The Strangers
171,Craig_McPherson,Something wicked this way comes,7,2 June 2008,"There's a moment in The Strangers, the horror/thriller starring Liv Tyler, that is so incredibly low-key that its significance may well go overlooked by unfocused members of the audience, yet is one of the most bone-chilling scenes I've seen in a long time. Such is the promise of fledgling director Bryan Bertino who, it would appear, has a bright future lying in wait.Touted as being based on a true story (really, nothing more than a parable based on newspaper home-invasion tales Bertino soaked up as kid coupled with a heavy dollop of the Manson murders), The Strangers tells the story of dating couple Kristen McKay and James Hoyt (Tyler and Scott Speedman) who retreat to Hoyt's parent's country cottage after a downer day spent at a friend's wedding, only to find themselves under siege by a trio of mysterious masked psychopaths (Kip Weeks, Gemma Ward and Laura Margolis).Eschewing the audience's desire for logic and answers, Bertino keeps the film's narrative as spartan as possible, leaving the viewer as much in the dark as the protagonists as to the motivations behind their assault. This unknown, coupled with the mounting indications that the attackers could easily decide the couple's fate at any time but choose to prolong their game of cat and mouse for the pure thrill of it all, is what gives this movie its edge.It's the nature of the human mind to seek answers and motivation in tales of tragedy, whether they are stories in the news, one's life, or from the print or celluloid realm. If somebody snaps, we have to find logic as to why, which is why stories or events whose sole motivating common denominator is nothing more than a mercurial thrill killing aren't to everyone's taste, and goes a long way towards explaining the mixed critical reaction to The Strangers. Yet as much as I found myself wanting more than Bertino's nihilistic ending, I also couldn't imagine a better way to wrap it up. Sometimes life (and death) just doesn't come with a pat answer, and in this case, Bertino deserves praise for not providing one.",The Strangers
172,reeves2002,"Great movie,but similar plot to the French film ""them""",7,31 May 2008,"I wanted to see this movie ever since seeing the trailer more then a year ago.I don't know why it took so long to be released and what the delay was, but it was worth the wait.I like Scott Speedman from seeing him in previous films and he was a good choice for the lead.And Liv Tyler was also a good choice for the other lead. They seemed to be playing an unhappy and awkward couple which fit right in with the dark atmosphere and depressing mood of it.The suspense built gradually which gave plenty of time to develop the characters nicely and then it became a terrifying experience for the couple just prior to them trying to patch up some of their problems.A 4:am knock at their door startles them and the tension builds from there.It is a very claustrophobic film and the director of it knows exactly what to do with the dark.It is supposed to be based on true events,but I am pretty sure it was just an American remake of a very similar French movie called ""Ils""(Them)with almost the same plot which was also based on a true story that happened to an Austrian couple.Both these movies were about a senseless and brutal home invasion of a couple in a country home in the woods by 3 youths.In the French version you couldn't really see the hooded youths stalking the couple in the dark which was a bit more terrifying.It was a twisted psychological attack.You could hear the horrifying sounds they made hiding in the shadows but couldn't really see them.In the strangers, 2 of the attackers wore these cheesy masks and the other one was wearing some kind of hood which was more spooky,but they were sometimes visible which was more realistic.The only part I hated was the way the movie ended implying Kristen maybe survives and then you don't know what happens next.It's a typical American ending where the female character always lives.Both victims should have just died like in the real story, or they both should have survived it.I hope there is at least an alternate ending for the DVD.

175,jaddison383,'The Strangers' are a little TOO scary...,7,23 July 2008,"We all know the plot: young couple, isolated vacation home, people in masks. Yet from the start of 'The Strangers' it's clear that this film is a different. In today's bloodthirsty society, horror films are often reduced to nothing more than gore-filled gross-out fests. While many young teens may rejoice at such films, many of us still long for original, suspenseful, and, yes, terrifying horror movies. 'The Strangers' came so close.There is plenty here to recommend: Director Bryan Bertino shows himself to be a patient and smart director. Rather than going for just cheap thrills, he wisely builds tension up to near-breaking point. The feeling of suspense and dread that covers the whole film is classic. Both Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman do well in their leading roles, and the strangers themselves are things of pure terror... yet that's where the film loses some of its commendation. The strangers at times seem that they can't possibly be human because they are made to be almost supernatural in their abilities. They appear and disappear seemingly at will and instantly- a power the young couple probably wished they had but don't because they are, after all, HUMANS. It's a simple mistake used to give the audience one of those cheap thrills that were otherwise so wisely avoided. What makes it sad is that in every other aspect, 'The Strangers' is chillingly realistic and terrifyingly possible. Every time those strangers come and go like ghosts of some kind, it makes the audience sit back once more and say, 'Ah, well, it's just a movie."" That's too bad.Still, 'The Strangers' is much better than your average horror fare. It's at last a new movie that realizes what you don't show can be even more scary than what you do. Still, one hopes that Mr. Bertino can touch up the mistakes from this film and , and deliver a really great horror movie next time around. 7/10 stars! Jay Addison",The Strangers
176,Perception_de_Ambiguity,This one did it right.,7,6 November 2008,"I'm claiming that if I say that a movie like this did it right then it means something. Well, maybe it just means that it worked for me, but fact is that horror is my least favorite genre and don't even get me started on slashers.It had a good build-up that wasn't just the usual happy average family life set-up like it is often the case with films like those, to create an especially strong contrast to the terrible things that happen later. It still did its job. The build-up is interesting enough on its own, it's not too long and has nice atmosphere. I was afraid that it would get shaky once the action kicks in, because the whole film was obviously done hand-held, but thankfully it didn't go to those lows. It is leisurely edited for this kind of film which is one of the reasons why I said it was done right. You don't have to constantly reorientate and can sink into the reality of the picture. You know where you are at all times. If a character is suddenly somewhere and I don't know how he got there I tend to give up the movie and don't really care anymore what happens to the character. This wasn't done here, except with the intruders, of course. For once my mind didn't automatically shut down as the characters were sneaking in the dark. I was with them at all times, except for once, when it went on for a bit too long.The directing is very good and I think director Bryan Bertino did what was possible with the material. The sound design might also be noteworthy, it's not only tense but also dense. *wink* The writing is consistent and compelling despite the lack of anything that you could call a story. It doesn't have much of a surprise ending either, but it plays fair, since you get what you can expect after seeing the opening scene.The strangers' faces are never revealed, although they take off their masks. This was a nice move because while you get the point that those are just regular human beings (more or less) it still leaves something mysterious. In the end you also have to admit that it is irrelevant how those people look. I think the director has a bright future ahead of him.PS: The final product has absolutely nothing in common with the French film 'Ils', other than the very basic premise of strangers trying to kill a couple in and around their house. If IMDb's FAQ section is anything to go by then this film was written 2 years before 'Ils' was made, so there is no direct connection between the two. It's neither a remake, nor was 'Ils' an inspiration in the making of 'The Strangers'.7/10, although I'd like to give it more. It's certainly effective.",The Strangers

It was a nice touch although I'm guessing that most of the teen crowd who saw this movie while I was there would have no clue who Merle Haggard is and certainly not know the name of his band.Yeah they can tell you everything Kenny Chesney has ever recorded but have no clue about perhaps the finest songwriter in country music history....oh well....I suppose that is a rant for another day.You could tell this film was trying to be maybe a modern day ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" or something along those lines with the isolated house and the masks and the weirdness of the attackers.It doesn't quite reach that level of fright but it is a cut above most of the stuff released under the label of horror these days.The acting and the sparse script are quite good in the film and the director did well,some shots were really creepy.But it reminded me of ""High Tension"" or ""Wolf Creek"" more than it did some classic horror films it was perhaps aiming for.Anyway most of the reviewers I read in papers and on line had this one pegged pretty well....it was a well made film but the ending sort of peters out like maybe the director didn't know how to wrap it up.Of course ,as with 90% of the horror films made today,you get a hint that maybe there will be a Part 2 to this one.This movie would be a good rental rather than spending the full price of a movie theater admission.And its strictly a rental,not good enough to add to your movie collection.And I'm not sure if this film was good enough to warrant a sequel....but that doesn't always matter either,especially with horror films.",The Strangers

180,Ky-D,Lacks imagination.,4,23 October 2008,"From the trailers I was pretty stoked to see this one; it had all the markings of a good, scary time. Sadly it ends up being a series of clichéd horror movie items and second rate writing.After a friend's wedding, a couple retires to a secluded home for a little get away and are shortly set upon by a trio of crazies bent on violence; generic plot devices ensue.From the very start the movie cripples itself by announcing that things end badly for the couple; it's hard to get too in the film when you already know that the main characters are screwed from the outset. Instead of wondering if the characters will make it and rooting for their survival, I just sat back and waited for their inexorable conclusion.That isn't the worst of the bad writing decisions though, not by a long shot. First of all the villains are, I swear to god, freaking ninjas; they appear, they disappear, they appear again, they make no noise when they move, they always know exactly where the victims are, they all seem to have spectacular night vision and are masters of the ancient art of stealth. It's impossible to take them seriously as human villains when they are basically supernaturally endowed.But wait, there's more! The victims are, in a word, stupid. They keep coming up with improbable reasons to split up, they find and then quickly abandon good hiding places, they neither make a real effort to escape of stay put and they completely fail to work together to survive. On more than one occasion they mange to get a clear shot on the bad guys with a shot gun and always manage to shoot too damn late to hit anything. The damn girl even trips and falls at one point! Come on now, that gag is so over done it's satire by this point. The worst bit of bone headed decision making comes in the form of the character Mike, who arrives at the house and immediately gets his windshield bashed in. He idiotically shrugs that off and he casually strolls up the house. Upon finding it ransacked he just decides to stroll on inside quietly and start poking around without bothering to call the cops or even check to see if anyone is home. Needless to say, things don't work out very well for poor old Mike, but I barely knew him and his idiocy certainly warranted what he gets.Speaking of of not knowing Mike very well, the film doesn't do a good job of introducing or developing any of it's characters. All of them (good and bad alike) are shallow and 2- dimensional, meaning it's neigh impossible to care what happens to them.After all that grumbling you might be wondering why a 4 and not lower; well despite to horrid writing the film has a good look to it. Good color and lighting complement some effective steady cam work. And despite myself I still did find some the imagery genuinely creepy, even if only fleetingly.All told the films fails to be the creep fest it so desperately wants to be.4/10",The Strangers

182,robertallenandersonjr,One very suspenseful great horror movie,8,30 May 2008,The Strangers did a great job building up suspense. I thought it was very suspenseful and great the way they made it. Their were so many different scenes that made you jump. It started out very good and then got a little bit boring. For the most part though it was really good. The 3 strangers were very scary and did a great job playing scary characters. I loved what the strangers did throughout the movie. They also never showed their faces at all which was very unique. It was pretty predictable but still good. The acting was very good and well played. For a horror movie they did a great job and didn't over act. As expected out of the movie as well their wasn't that many characters at all. The body count was very low and didn't have that many people. In the beginning you start to feel what the characters are going through and begin to like them. This movie really makes you think what you would do in this position. The thing that is the scariest about this movie is that it was based on true events. Pretty much the whole movie is all shot in one place and in one night. It was a pretty dark movie for the most part. Their wasn't a whole lot of blood and gore. So all and all this was a good horror movie and very suspenseful. Go see it if you like horror movie this one was a real treat.,The Strangers

187,commandercool88,Genuinely scary.,7,7 July 2008,"Close your eyes. Remember yourself as you were when you were a kid. You lay in your bed with tired eyes staring up at the dark ceiling. The bathroom is just down the hall. You can make it if you're quick enough. You won't let them get you. Them. And by the grace of the universe, you reach the bathroom safely and slam the door behind you. You're safe. But you're not out of the woods. You still have to make it back. And make it quick. One falter could be the end of you, and a running leap into your bed will keep you safe.Your conscious tells you there's nothing to be afraid of. Nobody's out there lurking in the shadows. Waiting for you. No Boogeyman, no intruder. No stranger. It's just the dark. Nothing more.But what if you were wrong? 'The Strangers' taps in to one of the most primal of human fears. Our own safety. Or, perhaps, the illusion of safety. That in our most vulnerable of states, within the walls of our own home, something may go wrong. What if we're not alone. What if we're not safe. What if someone broke that invisible seal, stepped over the line into our own privacy. Universally, it's enough to make the hairs on your neck stand with an uneasy shiver. And it's what helps make 'The Strangers', a sadistic and relentless horror experience, more or less effective.'The Strangers' should be commended for a brilliant first act whose minimalist approach is chilling to the bone. Bryan Bertino's debut film feeds off of silence, he plays his hand with a certain understatement that at times brings us back to the years when suspense, not gore, ruled the cineplex. We find ourselves dropped in the middle of the lives of these two people, unaware of the terror that lays ahead of them. It is an extremely potent way to set the grounds, and we the viewer become increasingly unnerved as the picture slowly progresses and the pieces begin to fall in place. The tension becomes nightmarish, and you'll find your hands inadvertently drifting to cover your eyes as you can do nothing but wait. And wait some more. It all amounts to a single scene whose own subtlety and unabashed creepiness will linger in memory for some time to come.There comes a time where 'The Strangers' seems to leave its genius first act behind and coast on autopilot. Bryan Bertino's inexperience begins to shine through, although his own potential remains obvious. But 'The Strangers' is one of those rare horror films today that does not drop the ball when it comes to delivering exactly what it promises. To scare you. And scare it does. It doesn't break any new ground, but Bertino uses the genre playbook to the best of his ability. Your attention remains squarely within the happenings of these horrific events playing out before your eyes. Upon reflection, there may not be much to it. 'The Strangers' is a one trick pony, but it milks its simple premise for all that it's worth.The disturbing and demented nature of 'The Strangers' makes for some genuinely frightening moments. It's 'Funny Games', minus the art-house flair and dark comedic undertone. It accomplishes all that it sets out to do, even if it feels resoundingly empty when all is said and done and everything feels like a blur. It often resorts to our two victims acting completely unevolved, and a few over-the-top moments may induce some unintentional laughter. But when it comes to setting a brooding atmosphere and torturous tone, 'The Strangers' does it better than most. It may be a minor addition to the horror genre (albeit a much needed jolt), but could mark the beginnings of Bertino's reign of terror.More reviews at rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public",The Strangers
188,jacklmauro,The Joys of Sadism,2,25 October 2012,"Can we finally acknowledge that horror films have largely turned into another genre, that of sadism? There is a huge difference between film bloodshed and gore that is a part of a horrific/suspenseful scenario, and that which is done so the audience can watch people undergo agony, as in the 'Hostel' franchise. I can't take it. It is not scary; it's just disgusting. As in this film. Take away the idiot decisions about the gun, going outside, leaving your girl alone in an isolated home after a freak comes by, calling for help, etc., and there's the making for good, scary suspense. Turn it into an exercise in extended sadism, and it's purely gratuitous in a disturbing way. Do people actually think it's 'scary' or 'suspenseful' to watch the girl beg for her life, as she sees her guy stabbed and stabbed? It's not. It's unrelenting misery and there's something way wrong with anyone who thinks it's good filmmaking. The strangers were extremely terrifying, and there are psychopaths out there. But this nightmare of torture and sadism is NOT a great scary movie (which I love as a genre), or suspenseful. It's mean and ugly, and what scares me is how torture is the new horror.",The Strangers
189,bennyhagen,Half a movie,4,2 September 2010,"The first 45 minutes are quite intense, the whole setup just works fine and the simple but effective cinematography is nice to watch. Though I was not really convinced by Speedman's attempt to reflect intense emotions, you can always rely on Liv Taylor, who is - given a rather thin piece of script - really working her ass off to get the most out of it. Congratulations for that. The mocking ""Strangers"" start off being quite scary and the concept seems to be somewhat more original then we probably got used too, so it all seems like we're going to have a good time, but then suddenly everything freezes in the most inelegant manner, as the makers seemingly just ran out of any kind of idea how to continue this promising movie. That means, there is almost literally NOTHING new happening from around minute 45, it feels writer and director Bryan Bertino had half a decent script and then needed to finish it in about 2 hours due to a deadline or something. So the other 45 minutes are basically prolonging 2 jump scares and 3 lines of really basic dialog with minimum creativity, like lights turning off and the after a few minutes on again for no obvious reason, till the point where some kind of climax should occur, which then never really happens. Instead we get something really unrefined and boring featuring not a bit of fantasy, it's just like no one really cared anymore.I'd recommend though watching the first half of the movie and then striding around in some dark forest for a while, that surely does the job much better. 4/10",The Strangers

191,thewillt08,People in masks is always scary,6,30 August 2012,"If someone knocked at my door at 4am it's most likely a stranger and I wouldn't answer. The Strangers is about a couple who left from a friends weeding to stay the night in a cabin in a secluded area. They get a visit from three strangers who turn out to be murderers. This poor couple goes through a terrifying ride which strikes fear into the audience.James and Kristin are the main characters in this movie and James proposed and Kristin said no, she wasn't ready. James had the entire house set up for their engagement with rose petals, drinks, and he was highly disappointed with her answer. It sets the tone for the entire movie. James is angry and doesn't really care anymore. His life got turned upside down and he is miserable. She feels awkward and disappointed and that's how the movie starts. It was a strong start and it set the stage.Its 4am and someone knocks on the door. James answers and a woman asks for a woman who clearly isn't in the house. It's just creepy and you can't see her face which makes it even creepier. The scariest aspect of this movie is that it's believable. The audience can imagine this happening to them and it hits on the fear of having your house being broken into. I was so scared I was shaking.James gets frustrated and leaves the house. He can't stand the sight of his own girlfriend and he just leaves. Meanwhile she is being terrorized by the three maniacs. Kristin calls James and he doesn't even care. He has this attitude that she could die and he won't even shed a tear. I thought it was great and characterization is not something you see in a horror movie. This movie had a lot of great scares, surprising scares, and a lot of predictable or cheesy jump scares. The Strangers is still a really scary movie that plays with the audience but the scares didn't last long. This movie was around 80 minutes and I felt the story was a bit rushed and there had potential for a lot more scares. For the time it gave the movie did its job.The masks and the idea of not being able to see the faces made the movie unique. Even in the end where the masks are taken off, you still are not allowed to see their faces. I wanted the see their face. The audience wanted to see the psychos who committed the crime. We have to wait for the sequel because when the truck pulls away in the end the woman said, ""Next time it will be easier."" That line made me cringe because it showed just how sick these people were. They messed with these people and walked around the house like they owned it. Apparently they did it for no reason too. ""Because you were home,"" one said. That is the best and scariest line in the movie. Overall this movie was incredibly scary and I did like it. It is a movie you have to invest your time in and watch without distractions. If you want the full experience, watch this movie alone, or with friends, with all the lights off at night. You will have trouble sleeping, guaranteed. I did enjoy the movie but I'm not sure it's a movie I can watch again and again. It only has that really scary feeling once so I would probably only watch it with people who have not seen it. For that it does not get the WillyT seal of approval but it did scare me. That certainly counts for something.",The Strangers

I elected to view the longer unedited version on DVD.The sense of fear and isolation combined with who is doing this and why, work a good head of fear. However, I would have imagined the killers would take a few hits themselves since after all the prey, did know they were exactly that and at one point were better armed with shot gun.As for those rationalist that ask is it Satan or memorex, who could say. Did we really want to see the faces of the killers? No, because that would have spoiled the delight of totally random killing in film.Since the killers were three against two, you would have thought perhaps at some point, God would have emerged from the ceilings and given the doomed couple a break at it. For certain it was not as if they didn't try. Running outside, attempting to drive away, hiding inside, all to not avail.So, one element was lost, the one where the viewer gets a wish from heaven and sees at least one of the slayers take a cut.These crimes of course are all too true to life, with the most recent at this writing , the Santa who murdered nine and was set to bomb the rest of the neighborhood.This flick is predictable and that's its weak point. Its strong points are suspense, real terror not from a three legged monster, but something much more existent in our new papers everyday.I would recommend this to those who enjoy being very scared and have a bathroom close by.",The Strangers

That in itself isn't a deal-breaker but the deafening noises that succeed every single one of these ""quiet"" scenes are. Whoever was in charge of the audio didn't know a hoot about dynamic range compression. Storytelling-wise I'm a little disappointed. The protagonists were never properly introduced to us, the viewers. Which is a big No-No. How can anybody sympathize with them, or at the very least care when they're the epitome of Jane and John Doe? I surely couldn't. No matter how hard I tried.p.s.

I know that under stress people tend to do things the wrong way but, seriously , there are things that can't be forgiven, I could cite them up to you but if you still insist on watching the movie, it's better for you to just suffer through them so you learn from your mistakes like I did.The sad thing is that the movie doesn't care about fixing all this, it goes on and on until the end.There is not a single redeeming quality on this movie, aside from the scary factor, no explanations, no mind games, not a single plausible plan from our protagonists, nothing, just dread and hopelessness up to the end.If you really want to see a nice home invasion that don't take itself too seriously please go watch ""You're next"", at least you get to see a nice revenge and a bad ass lead FOR A CHANGE.And next time that someone recommend this movie because of a similar one, please do take my advice, just be happy seeing any other ""similar"" home invasion movie, i'm sure it will be better than this one.If you want to feel sad, hopeless and feel that life isn't worth it, please go see this travesty, you will be convinced there is nothing more to do here than to go away.A solid 3 out of 10 and a total waste of Liv Tyler who could do a lot more with a better movie and some kind of ""script"" but this.",The Strangers
197,cmovies-99674,"Was the movie good, absolutely, but it was also very forgettable",7,10 August 2017,"PROS: There were some things done in the film that I really appreciated. Although the dialogue between the killers was very minimal, you still could since a specific aura between them, it gave depth to a movie with very little substance. The other part that I really loved was the ending, it was haunting and gut wrenching. The resolution to the movie could be anywhere from the last 5 minutes to the last 20. With strangers the ending was rather long, but not boring, in my opinion it was the most captivating part of the movie. CONS: The big problem that I had with this movie was how basic it was. I have no problem with a basic slasher thriller, but with that genre of movie it needs smart and resilient characters to hold it together. Not only were the characters not well developed, resourceful, or combative they were also poorly casted. I've seen horror films with worst acting for sure, but no matter how bad other movies are it doesn't take away from how underwhelming the acting was in this film particularly. Could they scream, yes, could they cry, yes, could they yell, yes, was it believable, no, and that was the problem that myself, the viewer, could obviously tell. The movie also struggled from a variety of plot holes. Who, where, what, when, why, and how are very important in slasher films, and in THE STRANGERS you either never got an answer or the answer was to vague to hold the story line together.www.chorror.com",The Strangers
198,terrible2,A Tale Of Two Movies...,5,19 November 2008,"Like many, I went into this (knowing) the basics of the story. That being said, I found the first half of the film quite suspenseful and creepy by modern movie standards. The story begins by developing the relationship between it's two stars, then separating them and introducing the terror. This worked, and worked very well in it's ability to set up (and scare the hell out of) the viewers. Unfortunately, after we have established what is taking place, the story seems to slow to a simmer, and eventually fizzles out. The second half of the film is filled with horror movie cliché's and cheap scare tactics, almost to the point of boredom... It's a shame, because I haven't been a fan of slasher films since the eighties, and I REALLY wanted to ""Like"" this film.My recommendation would be to watch the first half of the film, then go and sit by yourself in a cabin, somewhere in the woods.

Absolutely no moral to the plot whatsoever. Nothing meaningful out of this production. Props for the two main characters, they provided a unique storyline to salvage this movie slightly.

201,Matti-Man,A plot in search of a point,1,27 December 2011,"It doesn't matter how well or how badly a film is made, in order for it to be worth making in the first place there needs to be a point to it. Otherwise you're left with something full of sound and fury and signifying nothing, to quote the Scottish play.In dramatic writing, the point of a story is referred to as The Theme. It is the story's power- supply, its very reason for existing. Of course, having a theme, even a good one, in mind when you write a story is by no means a guarantee of success. But one thing's for sure, if your story doesn't have a point, then there's NO WAY that story will be good. Because there's no way for that story to make a connection with its audience.For example, to take the last few films I've watched, all of them had a point ... THE KING'S SPEECH: it's about courage. MEGAMIND: it's about redemption. REDBELT: without honour, you're nothing ... and so on.For the first hour or so, THE STRANGERS was developing nicely as a scary movie. But once we were into the last couple of reels (do films even have reels any more?) it was making less and less sense. Finally, it turned out that THE STRANGERS wasn't about anything at all. It was just a series of random events that added up to less than the sum of their whole. The title characters have no motivation, the protagonists don't learn anything from the experience. No one changes - all the characters have exactly the same mindset at the end of the film as they did at the beginning.Now you could argue that this is the same as real life. In reality, people rarely learn anything from their experiences, their characters hardly ever change, they're pretty much the same people at 40 as they were at 10. But films aren't about imitating reality. They are a highly stylised version of reality. Reality as we would like it to be, I suppose.Of course, not every movie has to be uplifting. I mean HARRY BROWN was as depressing as hell, but it made the point about the random violence of society's underclasses far more powerfully than THE STRANGERS could hope to. I don't think THE STRANGERS was even trying to make that point.So based on that, THE STRANGERS was a complete waste of time for everyone involved - film-makers, actors and audience.

The plot can be accurately described in a single short sentence - 'young couple in isolated house are terrorised by three masked intruders' - and as a result the narrative is so threadbare that even with the film's brief running time of barely an hour and a quarter, it starts to drag towards the end. There's also a lengthy scene (Liv Tyler seeking refuge in a closet) that seemingly only exists in order to pay homage to Halloween (1978), and like Michael Myers in that film, the titular characters in The Strangers have no apparent motive for their attack (Michael's actions were only given an explanation in the Halloween sequels). However, while in Halloween the unfathomable nature of Michael's lethal behaviour was perfectly in keeping with the near-supernatural qualities of the character, in The Strangers such randomness is just frustrating and makes the whole film rather pointless.",The Strangers
204,theskulI42,"Promising, atmospheric chiller with a letdown ending",8,18 July 2008,"""Why are you doing this?"" ""...Because you were home."" That was in the trailer, people! That was in every TV spot! How did this not make more money?! Honestly, I just don't understand America. People love to satiate their bloodlust by watching violence in every single facet of media, especially in the horror film, but they're ashamed of it, so they flock to neutered piffle like Prom Night. The Strangers is a real horror movie, there's no bullsh-t, no trims, no concessions. The film is as straightforward as a film can get: a couple, having relationship problems, in an isolated vacation home, and get terrorized by unknown assailants...in masks. The film owes pretty much everything to the films of the 1970s, and it does its damnedest to recreate the look and feel of the grindhouse fare of that era. Between the clothes, and the hair styles, and the transportation, and the tacky aged vibe of the country house, it's odd when you find out that the film is set not in 1975, but in 2005, and it's jarring to all of a sudden just see a cell phone, y'know? After a quick flash-forward, we meet James (Scott Speedman) and Kristen (Liv Tyler) are attempting to heal some wounds after a denied proposal of marriage has estranged tensions between the two to the breaking point. The film makes it a point to get us involved in the film, making us care for these characters and their relationship strife, resulting in a sort of almost desperately nostalgic attempt at lovemaking, and like Cloverfield before it (of course, they are less grating than that film's protagonists; these are adults, they have real problems), you almost forget that this is supposed to be a horror movie...until the thunderous knock on the door.This is a film not of grand gestures and Grand Guignol, but small details and the hallmarks of what really, truly scares people: the unknown, and extrapolating from there, the specifics: isolation, eerie unexplained noises and of course, the dark (with able-bodied support from everyone's favorite, the inane cheery pop song elevated to abject creepiness by its context). The refreshing thing about the film is that it doesn't cheat on any of its conceits. The car won't start...because the bad guys cut the engine. The cell phone doesn't work because the bad guys broke it. The heroine falls while running in the woods because there's a giant hole in the shadowed area that you or I would have fallen into as well (and the continuity that she stays injured for the rest of the film is a nice touch). This is a film that is terrifying simply because you have no idea what these people want, or if there even is anyone for a while. We've all had times where we've been alone in a house that we didn't feel comfortable in, and felt tension and apprehension when creaks and strange noises invaded our consciousness.In the acting department, three-fifths of the principle cast wear masks, two of which never speak (the other says about twelve words), and are mostly giant plot devices rather than characters, so they're hardly worth speaking of (apparently both of the women are quite attractive, including supermodel Gemma Ward, in possibly the most random casting move ever). As for our protagonists, both have a good lived-in, exhausted chemistry, and although are basically just screaming future corpses (not a spoiler, the film tells us in its opening shots, sadly), they manage to imbue themselves with a lot of dimension, and I was impressed. As for the direction, the atmosphere and terror is palpable, the shaky-cam is used within reason and the restraint in plot and camera is refreshing.It most definitely has serious problems, though. After a brilliantly terrifying first half, filled with all the terrors and bumps in the night that you can ever want, it seems to run out of ideas midway through, as it gets a bit tiresome as they seem to go back and forth, they would go outside, come back in, go outside, come back in, the strangers would come inside, stare at them, leave, come back, stare at them, leave. The first few times they snuck into the corner of the frame, it was wonderfully effective, but by the eighth or ninth time, they just came off as indecisive. I also got a little tired of their magical teleportation powers, where someone's hand would touch a shoulder, you turn around, and THEY'RE GONE! They're not ghosts. In addition, the ending, while completely logical and realistic, is a massive letdown and outside of a satistyingly Chigurhian exit for the strangers, it feels like a missed opportunity.Basically, it's Funny Games without the scolding (with antagonists that watch The Devil's Rejects while they have sex) or Vacancy, within the clever conceit, good visuals or crowd-pleasing finale. I was let down by its final reels, but it's nice to get a sixth good film of 2008, and Bryan Bertino should be a name to keep a look out for in the horror world.{Grade: 7.75/10 (B/B-) / #6 (of 55) of 2008}",The Strangers
205,shannen-l-c,Bitterly disappointing,4,17 February 2018,"After hearing from a few people that 'The Strangers' was a must-see for horror fans such as myself, I decided to give it a go. Although the beginning was somewhat promising it quickly fell flat.I think the fear of being home alone and having someone break in is a very common one that we all experience on a regular basis. For that reason this movie does a good job at ramping up the initial tension and fear at the beginning. However, there is very little going on throughout the movie to hold the viewers attention and after half an hour or so I stopped paying attention to what was going on because I was bored. The worst part of the movie is that at the end the victim asks the mysterious masked killers why they're doing what they're doing and their response is, ""Because you were in."" At that point I'd completely lost all respect for what the movie was. The only appeal left in the movie after watching two people fumble around in a big house for an hour and a half trying to evade a violent death, was that perhaps there was going to be an interesting twist. To learn at the end that what happened only happened because the couple happened to be at home is beyond ridiculous and made me feel completely cheated. Though the idea behind 'The Strangers' has potential as it plays on a very common fear we all share of being targeted in our own homes, the way in which its written is uninventive and unrewarding. If this movie made a few changes it could've earned a 6, 7 or maybe even an 8 star rating. All it needed was more focus on the characters, a deeper back-story and for the killers to be connected to the main characters in some way and therefore had motive for their actions. But in failing to do these things, unfortunately, 'The Strangers' is utterly forgettable.",The Strangers

She's always seemed mediocre mainly because of the fact she's never really given much to do. In Armageddon she was Steven Tyler's daughter and nothing more. And with This year's ""The Incredible Hulk"" she had nothing more to do than act pretty, which is fine. In the Strangers however she's actually given some scope and to my surprise she is far more talented than I first thought.Her talents are on display in this directorial debut from Bryan Bertino who plays her acting abilities to her and the audiences advantage. She's always been lovable, even when she's portraying a less than lovable character. So it hurts to see he tortured and hacked into pieces. The terror in her eyes are merely one feature that resonates out of ""The Strangers"" along with some of the most heart pounding jumps and scares of 2008. Prepare your nerves for a sound beating. Its atmospherical, its driven off the fear of others. And it could show Funny Games a thing or to about brutality. The killers in this movie do share many similarities with thoses in Funny Games. You get the feeling that there killing for spot, hunting if you will.Tyler asks her captors why there doing what they're doing. The reply sends a chill down the spine of its audience. ""Because you were home"" Killing for fun, has never been portrayed so effectively. A suburban couple returning to their semi-secluded house after attending a wedding finds their lives suddenly thrown into chaos with the arrival of three malevolent, masked strangers in director Bryan Bertino's tense tale of survival. Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman star as the couple forced to resort to violence they never thought themselves capable of as they struggle for their lives, and model-turned-actress Gemma Ward continues her transition from the catwalk to the silver screen as one of the merciless masked invaders.If i were to criticise it on anything it would be its inability to stop milking its horror. Much like the diabolical Prom Night we get cheap scares that come in the form of hose hold objects and mere knocks on the door. It really cannot replace true horror.But don't demerit it for such, it's still a magnificent debut and a wonderfully effective horror films that gives the middle finger to films like ""Funny Games"" and while it isn't as original or as intriguing as ""Funny Games"" it's almost three times as scary. Trust me, it will scare you rigid. This is for anybody who though ""Vacancy"" failed to deliver, for anybody who isn't looking for anything but ""a horrifically good time"" VERDICT: It's definitely a must see for fans of the genre, but be warned. Newcomers may find themselves covering their eyes, jumping from their seat and generally acting strange. Its predictability is quickly forgiven thanks to its impressive lead and solid characterisation. Much like Neil Marshalls ""The Decent"" you get to know these characters beforehand. You care for them.",The Strangers

People say there were a lot of 10/10 reviews of it listed from before the film came out. I believe it. Also, when I try to read those reviews by sorting in chronological order, it changes back to ""best"" order whenever I try to look at another page: shady.Maybe the worst offense this film commits is that it just can't figure out what to do about phones and guns. There are plenty of ways to deal with phones and guns in horror movies: any other way than here.

209,Krackoon,Dreadful first 30 minutes..,5,2 September 2014,"Scott Speedman and Liv Tyler tend to destroy anything they touch, and 'The Strangers' isn't any different. It's hard to imagine either actor (and I use that term as loosely as possible,) having anything to do with the success of any film they've ever been involved in.If you can get through the first 30 minutes of the two leads lack of emotion, and horrible line delivery, this home invasion thriller does pick up - not because of Speedman or Tyler, but because of 'The Strangers' themselves. Their lack of emotion, and lack of motivation is what really drives the film. It's what kills the two main actors, but it's something your villain(s) should possess. It's a nice change of pace.Random Ramblings of a Madman: Rating this a 5 out of 10 might be a bit of a stretch, but I found myself enjoying the film a lot more, once I stopped viewing 'James Hoyt' and 'Kristen McKay' the characters, and started viewing them as Scott Speedman and Liv Tyler - and once that happened, Dollface and Pin-Up Girl couldn't kill them fast enough.Let's just hope 'The Strangers 2' doesn't have any Scott Speedman flashback scenes.

I've seen this trend with several other terribly produced horror films that I reviewed recently. Is this a recent trend in the film business, or what? Because it's a bad idea. And it's evident in ""The Strangers"" that more than one person produced it, because the film really has no linear balance. There are a lot of great things going for ""The Strangers"" in the beginning, but that goes out the window as the film progresses towards the middle and ending. So basically, what could've been a 8 or 9 star movie, ended up being a 5 or 6 star movie. The bottom line is that nine producers and six production companies (Rogue Pictures, Intrepid Pictures, Vertigo Entertainment, Mandate Pictures, and Mad Hatter Entertainment) insure that a film WILL NOT have a unique and singular artistic vision. Perhaps a better coordinated production could re-do this film based on the first half and completely throw out the latter half.",The Strangers

I have to admit that The strangers films actual stranger were really creepy looking and when they came on the screen I was somehow into the movie, cause the two main lead actors slash victims was so boring, they had zero chemistry or character development.

The brutal events that took place there are still not entirely know.According to the FBI there are an estimated 1.4 million violent crimes in America each year. The scary thing is that this film is inspired by that true event which happened on that day. The whole reason this film differs from other scary movies is that it could really happen in real life and that is what I think the director wanted you to see. It seems like when directors make scary films there are always so cheesy and not really real like they would actually happen that way or realistically happen. For some people this may keep them up at night worrying and having terror that this might happen to them. Rarely would you get that scared if you were older, but I could see it happen to a younger kid if you let them watch this movie. It might have you leaving your night light on also just to help yourself sleep at night after watching this.The director set out to show you something in this film, weather it be to scare you or give you his vision or what really happened from true events that took place there.

213,mary-179-677383,Boring - YAWN,2,3 January 2015,"Okay a few problems with this movie.I will admit that I liked the start of the movie when you hear the loud knocking at 4am in the morning. The two actors answer the door and the front light is broken, so as they are talking to the girl at the door you can not see her face except that she has blonde hair and sounds young and stoned. They actors inform the girl that the person she is looking for is not there. The actors go about their business and the male character leaves to buy Liv Tyler some cigarettes. Presumably because he wants to get away from his girlfriend who turned down his proposal. So now she is all alone and the knocking starts again. I must admit this part was good and Liv Tyler doesn't open the door and speaks to the same woman again. She does lock the door...shouldn't the door have been locked already. She walks away and the door knocking now becomes violent. Anyways that's pretty much all that is good about the movie.****Spoiler ALERT**** Liv Tyler is in the kitchen the bad guy in the same room and what happens NOTHING. This happened all throughout the movie. The characters could have been killed about 100 times over by the killers who can appear and then 'disappear. The characters have no instinct when someone is behind them, I'm sorry but you can tell when someone is following you behind you. Also Liv Tylers character is so annoying or maybe it's just the actor.Then predictable, predictable and more predictable things happen and characters behave stupid.

The film even has some growing tension and scares, make us anxious for a way out for the couple, but their cowardice and mental incapacity is so great that you start looking at the clock asking for all this to end quickly, anyway.

It falls under the ""reality horror"" subgenre, meaning that there are no zombies, vampires, or witches necessarily. However, I, like a lot of IMDb members, feel that ""The Strangers"" themselves possess a bit of supernatural sneaking power that allows them to go undetected a bit too conveniently, but they were cutting to the chase to see their victims' deaths to the end, so their aim was true.The music was as spooky as I've heard. This is the first movie I've seen Liv Tyler in since Lord of the Rings Trilogy, so it was good to see she's back in movies. The tone was confusing for a movie that supposedly took place in 2005; to me, it felt as if it were taking place in the 1970's, possibly a decision to keep the universal theme of reality and ""era-lessness"" as a main subject to this horror.I wouldn't necessarily watch it again out of the blue. It's a bit generic for my taste, and others have rightfully criticized the lack of any true plot to the story and how things unfolded. It's middle-of-the- road, watch-if-you're-bored material, but to some, you may appreciate the attempt to ""keep it real.""",The Strangers

Uses the usual hooks that keep you sort of nervous all the way through, little episodes of rising suspense followed by some climax of abrupt fear. However, the whole thing begins to feel pointless, and we keep watching only to know if there will be a point. This movie could have been fifteen minutes long and achieved the same effect. There was very little dialogue in the movie so you can't really comment on the acting.

219,eytand94,The Strangers: A Terrifying Home-Invasion Horror Film,10,20 December 2009,"There were so many horror movies through the '000s that completely sucked. I'm talking about crap like ""The Ring,"" ""The Grudge,"" and more boring PG-13 trash. What we needed was a real horror movie. There's no problem with fun and campy horror, but some horror movies aren't meant to be fun. They're meant to be disturbing, shocking, and quite scary. After so much hype, I was able to see ""The Strangers"" in the comforts of my own home. The results equal one of the best, and scariest, horror movies of recent memory, next to films like ""Paranormal Activity,"" ""The Last House on the Left,"" and ""Drag Me To Hell."" The film is about a young couple, James Hoyt and his life-long sweetheart Kristen. They are coming from a wedding to spend the night in James's father's cabin in the woods. Kristen has refused a proposal from James, and the couple find it extremely hard to talk to each other. Suddenly, somebody knocks loudly on their door. It is a mysterious blonde asking if ""Tamara is home."" James says that she's got the wrong house, and the girl leaves. But later in the night, there are more knocks on the door. And the terror heightens when knocks on the door transition to strangers in terrifying masks bursting into the house. Can James and Kristen make it through the night? ""The Strangers"" is one of the most terrifying movies I've ever seen. It is a movie that really scares you for all the right reasons.It is a very suspenseful film, provided with several major ""BOO!"" scares and almost no gore. The movie wants to mess with your mind until you can't take it anymore. It has so much tension that you are way beyond the edge of your seat. You might just jump out of it.The movie becomes progressively more scary each time The Strangers appear in the house and take things farther. They show up at times that you'd never expect them to. That is key in horror movies, to have scares that you never see coming.Also, the atmosphere is perfect. The other reason this movie is so scary is because of the environment that James and Kristen are in. This could have been my house or your house. And like it is explained in the ending, The Strangers were there simply ""because they were home."" They didn't have a motive, which makes them that much more real and frightening.The performances are unbelievable. I never thought I'd live to see the day that Liv Tyler was in a horror movie. That finally happened, and damn, she's great in this film! And my God, can she scream! Scott Speedman is also flawless as James. As for The Strangers...well, let's just say that they will give you nightmares.First-time writer and director Bryan Bertino proves that there is still so much life left in the horror genre. ""The Strangers"" is highly recommended for those not looking for gore, but to have the daylights scared out of you psychologically. This is a perfect horror film.",The Strangers

221,IamtheRegalTreatment,Are you also still looking over your shoulder?,7,29 May 2008,"It's tough for me to put a true say on this movie compared to the average movie-goer. I saw a private show with my co-workers just a couple hours ago, just the six of us. Throughout the entire feature, we kept joking around, laughing at each other and made fun of each scene as best we could. But with all of that said, we still watched and enjoyed The Strangers.You may want a basic view on my thoughts of this thriller. Well, as I am writing this review, I am still looking over my shoulder. I can't help myself. I know nothing is there, but I get a small chill down my spine if I don't take 2 seconds to doublecheck the what ifs. That's what this movie did to me, and I'm glad. I haven't seen a movie like this in awhile that made you feel like it could happen to you. Sure, several movies in the past give us this feeling; but there is just something about the way the trailer makes you feel. There is just something about the situation. There is just something about the vibe. There is just something about The Strangers.The plot is very basic: a couple after a romantic date go off to one of their uncle's cabins in the woods for a romantic evening. Little do they know that a deserted house in the woods is the perfect place for a horror movie... duh? So, as the night goes on, several small occurrences come about from knocks on doors to russels in the woods. I will not give anything away, but it evolves from minor spine-chills, to brutal shocks.Overall the plot was decent, too predictable. The cast was good (my friend's kept yelling out Speedman during his scenes). Liv Tyler was average in the film; some points very good, others almost like she wasn't trying. I know if I was her, I'd be terrified in every scene and not turning my back on open areas like a stupid person would. Then again, I've never been in this situation (Thank God), so I'm not sure how I'd react exactly. The rest of the movie was very entertaining, including the ending. I would have tweaked some things, but it is based on true events for a reason. Like my friend's said, ""Based on true events, yeah this is what would have happened if the couple lived in Hollywood"". That should be enough for you.7 out of 10 for me. Worth your money I would say. This is the scary thriller movie we've been dying to see, do not pass it up.",The Strangers

If it was it doesn't work. If it wasn't, maybe they let a trainee camera operator handle the shooting! And some of the framing is bad too.

If the movie kept up that atmosphere it would've been a decent home invasion movie. Instead, it becomes a cliché woman running away from invades movie that kind of goes nowhere. There are a few decent scenes but overall, it doesn't come together by the end in the way that it could've. It is quite a hopeless picture which can be respected but perhaps ratcheting up the emotion would've made me care more. A recent example of a great slasher is You're Next which has a great twist and doesn't take itself seriously. The characters in Strangers are decent but the distant approach that this movie takes doesn't evoke too many emotions in the viewer. I can certainly see why some people appreciate this and I certainly didn't dislike it but it's dour tone left me disinterested and a bit disappointed. The approach I would've personally taken to the film would be to have the couple be tormented psychologically for an hour and a half with the family then leaving them alone. Thus, it would make them question whether their experience was real and what it meant which could then lead to them reconciling their struggles through adversity.

225,khemass,meaningless brutality,5,15 August 2009,"* Spoiler is in the first 3 lines of the second paragraph. That's all.Sometimes we better think carefully before we watch something. I regret watching this film, not because it wasn't scary, but because it was such a meaningless scary movie, only intend for you to be scared and have some unnecessary fear lingered in your heart.This story is just about some psycho killers came to brutally murder a couple in their vacation house. That's it, really. Nothing else. No character development, no meaning of any sorts, just watch them being followed, being scared to dead, trying to escape and fail again and gain, then watch them being killed slowly at the end. Why do people want to watch that sort of movie? I am not saying that the movie production was bad. Yes, it was scary. All the strange sounds, distant figures looming, all the tension building techniques seem to be effective. But why do we have to watch a scary film that sends a message ""No matter where you are, a psychopath can find you and kill you out of no reason""? They even try to make this message stronger by saying that the film is inspired by true story. But as a matter of fact, the truth of that case has not been confirmed if the murderers were really some psychopaths or someone who killed these couples out of personal reason or for revenge. The director just add everything in the middle and make it very scary.I don't recommend this film to anyone, especially if you are one of those people carefully select what you perceive through media.

226,jamesbourke59,Because You Were Home,4,20 August 2009,"When Bryan Bertino's directorial debut first hit the cinema screens, I was intent on taking a look at it. Of course I was work in a cinema, such good intentions tend to take a backseat when you find yourself working a ten hour shift.So time and tide tend to pass and the next thing you know, the movie's gone but the memory lingers still. So when the movie encored on DVD I didn't hesitate to buy it, such impulsions have carried me through many a movie purchase and to this day I still carry the scars.Whilst this movie should never be viewed as something you should want to watch with you loved one, I never the less managed to persuade my wife to watch the movie with me, such good intentions on my part backfire when my wife begins to grip my arm ever so tightly.She leans into me and whispers 'Have you locked the door?' upon such words I kindly reassured her and we carried on regardless, of course about a half hour into the movie I suddenly hear the gentle sounds of my wife softly sleeping by my side, so needless to say, any tension that she might have felt suddenly gave way to a deep slumber! So there I was, watching the movie, and I start thinking about that Sidney Lumet movie 'Network' and I remembered that line of dialogue the character Howard Beale shouted aloud 'I'm mad as hell and I'm not going to take this anymore'! Now normally my concentration would never begin to wain so early into a movie, especially one such as this, considering the early promise shown from the outset, so with such words still ringing in my mind, I drifted further back in my mind to consider just why it is that I always put myself through the same old torture! Now you might think at this point, enough is enough, turn the damned thing off! Such a thought never entered my mind. The writer director Bryan Bertino has concocted an intriguing premise, he has managed to fill the screen with just the right amount of menace and tension, the casting of Scott Speedman & Liv Tyler was spot on, so you might think to yourself, wherein lies the problem? How many times in movies such as this, do the characters go around in circles,for a perfect example Speedman's character wishing to exert his macho charisma forever tells Liv Tyler's character to wait in the house! Such an idea is beyond such comprehension, as we all know that the masked perpetrators will always gain easy access to the house.With such a simplistic idea, Bertino, to my mind dig's himself a very big hole, granted you never quite know just how the movie is going to finish, with that being said, when we do reach the finale, and both Speedman & Tyler have been put through some serious hell, Tyler quite rightly feels the need to ask them why they did what they did, to which the young girl replies 'Because you were in!'.When the girl spoke those words, my mind much like Howard Beale's crackled with such fury, from whence I then spoke aloud 'Is that it? So if only this young couple had just ignored the knocking on the door at four in the morning, we much the titular characters would all be safe and sound asleep in our comfortable beds.If only such thoughts were that simple, the other main kick to the cinematic gutt was when the three as yet still masked villains decided to unmask themselves, at this point I was gearing up for some crumb of comfort, but what do you know, the director has decided to keep their faces out of frame! The ending much like the movie itself primarily presented us with a germ of a good idea, however my thoughts tend to make think that the director or maybe even the producers had their collective eye on the prize that is the sequel or to be more precise, a prequel! Yes indeed we all have money to burn and time to waste, will I learn from such an exercise? I doubt it, I like watching movies, and for every stinker you will always find your rose.I've lost count of the amount of stinker's I've watched, but the rose that is my wife, will always be my constant.My rating is 4, this is based on the performances of the lead actors and the costumes worn by the killers.",The Strangers

It wasn't about ghosts haunting you or anything like that, it is based on three strangers ""haunting"" these people in a real way.While some of things the strangers did would be very hard to do in real life (like when the Dollface pinched James, when he turned around she was gone.

Feel free to use it.",1,25 July 2008,"Let me start by saying that I like scary movies...but to be effectively scary, a movie has to follow some coherent internal logic. This one doesn't. Characters in a good scary movie ought to behave--at least initially--as though their brains were functioning. These characters don't. There's nothing wrong with gore and brutality--assuming they're used for some reason. No rhyme or reason here. A group of masked kids terrorize a young couple who, as the film unwinds, behave inexplicably--leaving each other alone at moments where it makes no sense to do so, failing to make use of potential weapons at their disposal until it is, conveniently, too late for the weapons to do any good. Why does all this happen? Who knows? Who cares? Fairness compels me to point out that most of the audience--almost exclusively between the ages of 13 and 15 (which should have tipped us off) spend the entire length of the movie screaming constantly, which, I imagine, was why they'd come. To suggest that this film deserves remotely to be compared with films like ""Psycho,"" ""Silence of the Lambs,"" or ""Alien""...well, I'm at a loss for words that aren't too tasteless for this forum.

It has a decent but small cast, a low budget, and no splashy special effects. Further, it isn't the least bit original. Panicked, isolated victims fighting for survival against masked sociopaths is a time-honored story that has been told in one way or another in a great many films -- ""He's Out There,"" ""Hush,"" and ""You're Next"" immediately come to mind. But here's the thing about ""The Strangers."" It's not just scary. It's really, really scary.What sets this movie, written and directed by Brian Bertino (""The Monster""), apart from the aforementioned home-invasion flicks is hard to define. It's fairly well executed, decently written, and well shot, but so are many other films that don't achieve this level of suspense.Perhaps it's the good performances by Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman. Tyler is a talented actress who expertly embodies unnerved, and she plays to that right from the beginning of the movie, setting the stage for nail biting thrills before the real action even starts. Speedman also does a bit more than one would expect, infusing his character's obligatory, horror-movie machismo with just enough uncertainty to make him acutely relatable.Perhaps it's that Bertino has written characters who do what you or I might do under stress that pushes this effort to the next level. When Tyler hears the plaintive voice of a woman who's knocking on the door, does she open it? No. She throws the deadbolt and finds a phone. When Speedman gets ahold of a shotgun and shells, does he tromp around looking for trouble? No. He gets his back into a corner and waits for the trouble to come to him.Perhaps it's the measured calm of the psycho-killers that works on our nerves so effectively. As relentless as they are, rather than display the frenetic aggression we expect, these masked savages take their time, savor their own evil, and seem to enjoy standing quietly unseen in the background and simply ... staring.Whatever it is about ""The Strangers"" that's so efficient at ramping up the anxiety, you'll need a little bit of patience to experience it. The first 20 minutes is devoted to setting up an interpersonal dynamic between Speedman and Tyler that arguably isn't altogether necessary to the story but that doesn't hurt beyond delaying things a bit. But once the action really gets underway at about the 20-minute mark, it's white knuckles the whole rest of the way.When I choose a horror movie, I am looking for one thing: to be frightened. That's exactly what I found with ""The Stranger."" Recommendation: Lock the doors, close the blinds, and watch.",The Strangers
232,joben-525-633946,Nothing award winning but Bertino is certainly shows he is no Stranger at tackling horror,6,27 July 2013,"With no plot, little character development and a director with little experience of the genre, these points alone appear to condemn 'The Strangers' to a shallow grave. However, what director Bryan Bertino does get right, he gets right with aplomb.Straight from the off you gather that 'The Strangers' will not be pulling any trees or smashing any Oscar winning awards for the film in general. It has many drawbacks and isn't dissimilar to the disappointing French horror 'Them' ('Ils'). The premise is straightforward and perhaps a little clichéd as a couple returning from their wedding reception (Scott Speedman and Liv Tyler) are victims of a horrific home invasion at the hands of a trio of warped psychos. Again as I have previously stated, the storyline premise is nothing to get overly excited about.Now, after harshly beating around the bush for every little niggle (or most) I have with 'The Strangers' I can now tell you its far from catastrophic.Without doubt, Bryan Bertino has pieced together a creepy - at times rather terrifying - tale of cat and mouse which I say could rival the majority of horror movies in the past decade in terms of sustaining suspense and atmosphere. The jump scares are used when appropriate but certainly not overused.Another enormous plus to the film is that the acting form the leading roles in Speedman and Tyler is superb. Although the script may ask them to act in strange ways at times in dealing with situations, they are thoroughly believable and you can really root for them as Bertino sets up his disturbing - if a tad obvious - final act.Overall, 'The Strangers' is a terrible movie - lacking in so many aspects which make a film worthwhile.As a horror film, 'The Strangers' is certainly up there.",The Strangers

234,michaeljharvey,Certainly better than your average horror film,7,3 June 2008,"This is definitely NOT a movie for the all too typical ""horror fan"" who thirsts for a rapidly rising body count and lots of blood and gore. On the contrary, this film is very much about realistic, psychological terror.It puts the viewer in the place of the young couple being terrorized. It makes you ask what you would do in a situation like this. You're in an isolated cabin, you have no way to call for help and you're being attacked by unknown, murderous assailants who always seem to be a step ahead. Many will criticize the actions of the couple in the movie, but how can these critics be so confident they would fair better? If a critic honestly believes he would be able to go outside the house and take out the assailants in Rambo-like fashion, he must clearly have a deluded sense of reality. When faced with something that is just outright evil and chaotic, most people would panic and make poor decisions. To me, the couple's actions were quite believable.I suppose one issue I had with the film was a lack of tension in the second half due to a feeling of inevitability. All along the killers are smarter, quicker and stronger. They just toy with their prey. At no point did I get the sense the young couple might even have a fighting chance. While this leads to a growing sense of dread, it cuts most of the suspense.Also, although the film tries for gritty realism, the killers sometimes seem to be almost super-human. They sneak soundlessly in and out of the house. They always anticipate the couple's exact next move. They have an eerie fearlessness, even when they realize the couple is armed with a shotgun. They attack and monitor the house with the precision of a SWAT team. However, despite such precision and planning, they (incongruously) use improvised weapons (the ax from the shed, the knife from the kitchen). Was this attack on a random house carefully planned and considered for months, or just thrown together on the spur of the moment? The killers' actions are inconsistent in that respect.Many will complain that the ending, in failing to give the killers a clear motivation, is weak. I feel this is what makes the movie frightening. The unknown evil, lurking in the shadows is always the most terrifying. Are these people serial killers, just plain evil/insane, part of a cult...? The unanswered questions make their actions all the more disturbing. Also, this movie raises a lot of questions about human nature in general. Think of all the trust we place in each other on a daily basis just to get through our lives. There will always be dangerous, unethical or deluded people willing to take advantage of that trust. The police can't be everywhere at once; a situation like this is certainly plausible.I feel the final scene where the killers meet the Bible-toting kids on the road is simultaneously ridiculous and thought provoking. The killers had gone to such pains to hide their identities behind masks. Why would they then reveal their faces to these children, who will obviously discover the carnage just up the road? Not a very intelligent move.On the other hand, the scene does show how easily the killers are able to blend back in to society. Within minutes, they go from murderous monsters to average, polite people driving a country road in an old pickup truck. This is perhaps the most frightening point of the film: Killers like this probably don't look like monsters at all.",The Strangers
235,rjyelverton,Unrelenting film taps into current dread,8,6 January 2009,"We are living in a time of dread. The economy is highly unstable. We are fighting two wars. Pensions are disappearing, new housing developments sit empty, and our jobs are cutting back hours, benefits. We are aware that our institutions, homes, and places of business are are vulnerable to collapse. The Strangers taps into this existential dread and channels it into an effective, disturbing, and very sad tale of home invasion. It also gave me nightmares for weeks.You may have had the feeling while watching horror films that they are not exactly scary. Freddy Krueger has not scared anyone since he left Elm Street. Jason and Michael Myers are such indestructible super men as to render them only scary to the very young. The films these bogeymen occupy are gore delivery devices. A true horror film takes the mundane and adds real evil. A true horror film plays like a nightmare and makes you believe that ""yeah, this could happen. And it could happen to me."" ""The Strangers"" is a true horror film.The film, similar in execution and premise to the recent French import Them, tells the story of two young lovers (Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman) who have their vacation home invaded by three anonymous souls who seemingly have no motive other than to terrorize. ""The Strangers"" is calculated and careful. It's a sleekly crafted, but sad story. The final scenes are so brutal and uncompromising, though not especially gory, that you are more likely to be left in despair than frightened.I admire ""The Strangers"" for its execution, but it is a horrific tale without hope. This film stares into the abyss and sees weeping and gnashing of teeth. Hell is not somewhere else. It's right here.",The Strangers
236,rwint1611,Disappointing,4,15 June 2008,"THE PLOT: A young couple staying at a isolated vacation home find themselves being terrorized by three very weird, mask wearing people for no apparent reason.THE NEGATIVE: The first time this concept was done was in a 1973 TV-Movie called TERROR ON THE BEACH starring Dennis Weaver and Estelle Parsons. It involved a similar situation of a vacationing family renting a remote beach house and then finding themselves being terrorized for no apparent reason by a group of young adults. I remember seeing the ads for this film and thinking it was such a great concept because in reality the majority of victims are people who were just in 'the wrong place at the wrong time' and had no previous connections to their assailant whatsoever. Unfortunately the suspense in that film was not stretched out enough and the resolution was awful. I was hoping that this film had gotten it right and although it starts out well, and stretches the suspense out better, it still ends up clunking almost as badly. One of the main problems is the fact that the killers fall into all the unrealistic trappings that so many killers in today's horror films seem to have. They always seem to be so amazingly clever, cunning, and proficient almost like they are superhuman. There are just too many instances where they seem to just appear and then disappear with the blink of an eye. They are also able to mysteriously enter into the home without any explanation and throw the victim's cellphone into the fire without her noticing. In a film that purports to be so grim and realistic than logic loopholes like these cannot and should not be accepted. After all the world we live in is governed by the law of physics and every human being in it, even the psychotic ones, are bounded by them. The set-up should have also been better with more of an explanation of why this couple is at this house, where the house is located, and even a nice daytime bird's eye view of the house so we could see just how isolated it really is. For what it is worth it really doesn't seem all that secluded as they might want you to initially think as some shots show the house to be right next to a street that is lined with lights and, as evidenced by the next day, it is still in the vicinity of door to door solicitors who don't even have to drive a car to get there, but simply can ride their bikes. It is also a mistake to have the movie start out on such a somber note, detailing the friction between the couple. They are about to be propelled for the next hour and a half into the fight for their lives so why not allow for at least a little levity at the beginning. Also having the protagonists best friend show up briefly only to get immediately killed off in a stupid fashion seems pointless. Also the couple itself needs a little more fight in them and not to go down like they are nothing more than lambs to the slaughter. Apparently in order to give the film a more 'documentary' feel they put in a lot of hand held camera shots, which quickly become very annoying. There is also the issue of the blood looking really fake. The blood on the wall looks like colored water and the blood on the knife looks like it is nothing more than sticky red syrup. In this age of high tech computer generated effects can't we at least get blood that really looks like blood. The ending is irritating as well as the killers take off their masks, but we the viewer are not allowed for some reason to see their faces, which only proves that this 'horror' movie is nothing more than one big, long gimmick. Having the killers then drive off where they stop and take some Christian literature from some boys who ask if they are sinners and they reply 'sometimes' is just pushing the irony button a little too hard. Finally there is also the issue of this purporting to be a 'true' story. Either it is based on verifiable actual events or it is not. Having the director say that he remembers a strange knock on his families door late one night when he was young or saying that it is very loosely based on the already over told Manson murders just doesn't cut it and they should be sued for false advertising.THE POSITIVE: This is still a great concept and had it been done right could of made for a great horror film. The tension at the beginning is good and unlike most horror films of today it dares to build it up slowly. It is nice to see that the film makers are savvy enough to keep the clock on the wall accurately keeping the right time with the action. Tyler for her part seems convincing.THE LOWDOWN: Overall this is a very disappointing experiment. The film makers make to many compromises with the logic and the ending certainly has nothing redeeming about it.THE RATING: 4 out of 10.",The Strangers

The setup was original and I was enjoying the slow creepiness and build up. I must admit that for the first part of the film, I was legitimately frightened.Then the second and third act appeared, which really sucked. Every decision the characters made was pretty stupid, both the good ones and the bad ones. The bad guys had every chance to kill the protagonists and didn't do it. And the protagonists had every chance of running away and they didn't do it, for some reason.Also, it is very unclear what the ""monsters"" are. They seem like normal people but suddenly do things like disappear and things like that, but they are supposed to be serial killers, that aspect was just filled with plot-holes.The acting was pretty bad throughout the whole movie and I didn't care for the main character or her life.At the end, they make it appear as if something different and original happens, but then they just f*ck it up like everything else.Also, the camera work is extremely sloppy. I mean, every shot is a hand-held shot. you can always see the camera moving around and it is extremely annoying.In conclusion, don't watch this film. It is a waste of your time.",The Strangers

But anyways, everything that comes after that has all been seen and done before, but here is much, much worse. Scary noises might work a couple of times but not for the whole movie, characters might make bad choices, but these ones are completely retarded. The worst part is that it's for all nothing, no reasons, no explanations and no rewards to the viewer after having spent an hour hearing sounds and watching masked people playing cat and mouse.

246,knuckles_and_sonic,Same Old Clichéd Hollywood Horror,5,26 October 2008,"Now I am a huge fan of horror and love the classics such as Halloween, A Nightmare On Elm Street, TCM etc but its becoming more obvious that Hollywood has lost its talent for delivering a good horror film.Recent films I like that are Hollywood Horror are the SAW and Final Destination franchise. Don't get me wrong though, I love a good suspenseful story which is what made Joy Ride such a pleasure to watch.This film on the other hand fails in all accounts at making a decent plot, with suspense. The premise of this movie is quite good but the film never takes off, left to wander about at such a slow pace that I thought it would never end. Whenever something intriguing might happen, it falls back on clichés. For example when I see one of the strangers being spoken to, I expect him to stay there, but no, the heroes look away and look back and the character is gone...so predicitable.The acting was barely enjoyable either, Liv Tyler...what happened? The ending of the film was clichéd as well...I mean cmon...Iv'e seen that exact same thing so many times before! My main problem with the film though was its pacing....nothing suspenseful ever really happens and we don't spend enough screen time with the strangers for them to truly become a threat to us and the 'heroes' of the film.I think I'll stick with watching Asian Horror such as Audition, Battlefield Baseball etc This film elicits a massive 'Meh' from me.

The Strangers is a film about a couple in an isolated village who are haunted by three unexpected physcopathic murderers. I do think the producers got bored making this film in a space of 4 months so they decided to just stick in a load of rubbish. They tried to hard with this film, and it was a total waste of time, me and plenty of other people (I imagined) was excited to see this film with the great, spooky trailers but it was very disappointing, within a space of 1hr and 22 minutes I was only entertained by 20 minutes of it, the ending. But one bit what got me really angry was how they all took there masks of strangely enough. For a start, there killers, who would show themselves to the victims. And also it had a very freaky ending with Liv Tyler (Kristen McKay) screaming and making me jump out of my skin. Yeah so..... basically it was a bunch of polony! But the reason why I voted it 5 stars is because it actually passed the BBFC test as a 15 which I found incredibly weird but quite amazing! I imagined this film to be maybe a.... 18? Especially with the consumer advice and the disturbing images. And of course for the beginning, that was the most entertaining because it made me laugh how Kristen (Liv Tyler) was laughing at nothing..... Which is true because if you remember by the beginning, she was sat at a table just laughing and looking towards a different table and they wasn't even talking, never mind making jokes. Other then that.... there was nothing else, if that didn't show on the film it would be 0 stars!",The Strangers

After hearing good reviews from a fair few critics, I decided to give it a go; after watching it however, I felt slightly disappointed.It lacked an outright story, instead; making use of a jumbled up mess of plots from other horror films, namely Halloween, Psycho and other classic slashers. This was somewhat disappointing as the trailer looked promising to say the least.However, what it lacked in plot, it made up for in sheer terror, this is not a film for the fainthearted, not gory; just genuinely scary. I jumped numerous times in the film, one scene in particular, but figure out for yourself which one that is.The acting was decent, though Liv Tyler looked particularly bored with her role and didn't really match up to expectations.Ultimately, this is an old fashioned, genuinely scary horror film which is something that is hard to come across in the 21st Century. Whilst it lacked some fundamental points to make it an entirely successful film, it is certainly a good watch.",The Strangers
250,pachl,"As scary as ""Jaws"" on land !",9,6 December 2008,"First of all, I wouldn't know how to comment on this movie without saying something that might be considered a spoiler, so here's one of the few times I going to reveal a little... but just a little.As you may know, the plot revolves around a man and woman who are spending the night at his summer/weekend cottage. At 4am, there's a knock on the door. Well, it's not just a knock; it sounds more like a battering ram. Just hearing that sound made my heart jump, and I'm kind of a jaded movie-goer. I now live in Prague (Czech Republic), and there is an art movie theater right on the first floor of my building.What's creepy about this film is you don't really know the level of menace the couple will encounter. It seems like the tormentors have plenty of opportunities to kill them, but it's almost like a cat playing with a worn out mouse.I can easily imagine this movie having been made in another country. The budget must have been minuscule, but it's infinitely more scary and tension filled than a movie that goes for cheap shock value. This is the real deal. The tension is isn't just palpable; sometimes it's almost suffocating. I was really tense watching this, and nowadays when we've seen it all before, that is quite a feat.I don't know if the brunt of the credit should go to the writers, or to the director. In different hands, this movie would have been a complete bore-fest, but the director works magic with the material he's given.This night only lasts a few hours; remember, most of the action starts at 4am, but the tension is so high you'd swear the night lasted for twelve hours.I would strongly recommend this movie for someone who enjoys scary, tension-filled movies, but is turned off by stupid special effects and connect-the-dots story lines. This movie is special. Don't miss it.",The Strangers

I saw The Exorcist, Rosemary's Baby, The Ammityville Horror, and The Omen all at a young age, and none of them scared me. The problem was the effects were so cheap and fake looking, or the plot was way to unbelievable to scare me. The horror flicks that creep me out are the ones that could happen, or the ones that are based on actual events. Movies like Jaws, Psycho, Hostel, or Vacancy have creeped me out enough that I refuse to ever go in the ocean, stay at a motel or ever visit Europe. I can absolutely say I am proud to add The Strangers to this list.The Strangers is creepy from the opening frame to the very final one. From the minute you hear the voice over describing the events which are about to take place to the chilling 911 call in the beginning, your blood turns to ice, and you start to wonder just what am I in store for here?.On a nice summer night James Hoyt (Scott Speedman, from Underworld) and Kristen McKay (Liv Tyler, daughter of Aerosmith front man Steven Tyler) leave their friends wedding and return to the Hoyt family summer cottage. At exactly 4:05 am they hear a knock at the door where a woman is standing asking them if Tamara was home. James simply tells her that she had the wrong house to which she replies ""Are you sure""? When she is sent off that's when the mind numbing suspense begins.Kristen runs out of cigarette's and James volunteers to run out and grab her a pack. Once left alone three strangers all wearing masks unleash terror on poor Kristen, and eventually the returning James. The strangers are all wearing masks. One of them has a burlap sack over his head, one has a doll face mask and the other has a pin up girl mask. You never see their faces and they show zero emotion. That's what makes The Strangers work.The Strangers does rely on the typical wood chase scenes and the usual pop outs to scare the audience. With that being said it also relies on raw emotion and that's what puts the fear in anyone watching this movie.The Strangers will go down as one of the scariest movies ever made for this generation, and a laughing stock for the next, but who cares.

Yes, I have seen all the mainstream gems like Halloween, The Exorcist, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and The Ring. But this movie beat all of them for me.Some people prefer the type of horror where a killer goes after a person with a knife and refuses to stop until that person becomes their next victim. Others prefer the more psychological side of horror where everything happens for a reason and the movie tends to mess with your mind. The Strangers was the perfect mix of both.This didn't just come out and reveal the antagonists, but it didn't wait until the very end to expose them, either. It was very slow-paced with a few jump moments to briefly change the pace, and when they came, even though I expected them, they still scared the bejeebies out of me. Especially the closet scene with Pin-Up Girl. I literally screamed out in my seat. First time I had done that during a movie in quite a while.So don't be fooled, this movie was released last year. But that does NOT mean it can't be a horror icon. The slow paced macabre gave you a feeling of helplessness for the characters. This had my heart rushing until the very end.

How could I have expected something so unoriginal, so poorly written and so atrociously predictable!

As things progressed I found myself hoping for some redeeming quality, something unexpected, something new, something to rescue (at least partly) what had gone before. No luck.In summary, this film is a disaster and not worth the celluloid it's printed on. What a total waste of money and time.

Later, about half-way through the movie, the couple are hiding in the closet (what a symbol) and the guy shoots his friend in the head, thinking he is one of the zombies. Then the invaders come, and they are apparently appear to be there just to annoy, embarrass, or humiliate her.

How can you get tense and scared if there's no reason for it? They spend the first 10 minutes explaining how this couple got to their house, and the next hour creeping in the dark, and believe me the end is worse than the middle, a complete letdown.It's really sad to realize that these days they can make junk like this and earn money, and a 6.1 rating on IMDb? This goes to show you that there is a big percentage of teens voting here who are satisfied with nothing over something with substance. Do yourself a big favor, watch ANYTHING else, it will be a better use of your time. I can appreciate a good thriller, and this isn't one of them, it's among the worst I've ever watched. To think I wasted almost 2 hours of the bulb on my projector for this junk. To the director of this picture: Thanks for nothing, and I do mean nothing, which is basically what happens in this movie.",The Strangers
258,m-rugen,Overdone,3,31 May 2008,"This comment definitely contains spoilers, so, do what you gotta do.Okay, I'm all for the horror genre. I am a fan of Rob Zombie's Halloween which seemed to get bad reviews overall, so you would think I'd be a fan of The Strangers: wrong. Although there were some good points such as the isolation of the home and when James shot Mike (granted you saw it coming, but regardless it was still original), the movie had countless flaws that I could not see past to give this movie higher than a 4. My favorite part, however, was when Kristen poured herself a glass of water and you see the Man in the Mask in the background.1. The blip in the beginning of the movie contradicted the ending.2. It started off really slow and the two flashbacks were unnecessary.3. When Kristen escaped the shed, why was the 'stranger' not immediately following her given the fact that she was crawling away? 4. There were at least five times where a 'stranger' or even Kristen/James themselves popped in out of nowhere to give the audience a scare (even though at the 9:55 showing at Farmingdale Multiplex everybody decided to scream THEN laugh at those moments), which is why I considered the movie overdone.5. The beginning of the movie resembled Vacancy too much (which was a pretty good movie in my eye) given the fact that Kristen and James had tension between each other.6. The ending (1): The chicks take the brochure from the Mormon's and as they get back in the car one of girls states ""next time will be easier."" May I ask why? 7. The ending (2): Why end the movie with Liv Tyler alive (hence the contradiction of the beginning) for that final scream to get the audience to jump? Just felt unnecessary to me.There are a few other points I could post as to why I dislike this movie, but I'm sure you get the idea.Now I get to look forward to Hancock and The Incredible Hulk :D",The Strangers

I remember it being ""based"" on a true story. But I never got to see the movie until recently. I should have forgotten it. It is not a good movie.This movie has got to be the slowest horror thriller movie ever. The music, the plot(if there was one), and the characters move so slow in this movie. Continually throughout the film one of the victims keeps asking, ""Why are you doing this?"" This question gets asked over and over and I kept thinking what a great question. The reason is because I cannot understand why this movie was made at all. Every silly horror movie criticism can be found acted out in this film.I could not wait for this movie to end and was constantly looking at my watch to see how much time had gone by.

Insipid, stupid couple alone in a summer cottage of the boyfriend's family, hear a knock at the door at 4:00 a.m. First mistake - they open the door at 4:00 a.m. to see who it is. There's a girl asking if her (can't remember who she was asking for - it was that boring) ""friend"" is there. It freaks them out a little. Guy goes to get cigarettes, leaves girlfriend alone. Blah blah blah, pandemonium ensues. I don't know what I would do if faced with a similar situation, but I would hope I would do everything in my power to thwart these psychos (the ""strangers"", not the insipid, stupid couple). I'd throw everything at them but the kitchen sink, if I didn't have a viable weapon. I have several indoor cats and have a good spritzer. Maybe I should keep a spritzer full of sulfuric acid in it. That would stop intruders in their tracks. Anyway - don't bother with this one. I've never seen two more stupid people doing the absolutely wrong thing at every turn.",The Strangers

Kristen McKay and James Hoyt.The Strangers isn't everything that you'd expect in a horror movie. While most people were hoping there would be an endless array of gore and hack-and-slash terror, the film introduced to us a not so new brand of psychological horror in a new fashion. James Hoyt (Scott Speedman) and Kristen McKay (Liv Tyler) come home from a friend's wedding reception. Both upset from an event that occurred not a few hours earlier. After speaking in broken conversations, they eventually in each other's embrace, only to have their only real romantic moment be interrupted by a knock at the door. It's 4:05 AM, a girl stands in the dark on the front porch, asking if ""Tamara"" is home. James tells her that there's no one by that name at the house. The girl leaves. A few moments after, James leaves to take a drive. Kristen is left alone. After opening a beer, putting on a record and exploring the house a little bit, a loud bang is heard. The girl is back, once again requesting to see Tamara. Kristen tells her she's already been at the house. The girl responds with ""Are you sure?"" before leaving. After the experience, Kristen changes into her casuals and calls James to inform him of the girl's return, only to have the phone cut out on their conversation. While smoking a cigarette, awaiting James' return, a man with a mask seems to find his way into the house, Kristen has no idea he's inside. Eventually, the stranger confronts her through a glass door. The night has only begun for Kristen and James as these strangers play with their minds and lead them on the fight for their life.--8/10-- The Strangers offers well done scares and countless times of Psychological kicks to the skull. I found myself at times looking over my shoulder to be sure that a man in a burlap sack mask wasn't watching me from behind a wall. After I was reassured the man was nowhere to be found, I continued watching the movie. Bryan Bertino, a first time director and writer, gives us a peek into the dark machinations of a psychopathic family who seems to get off on psychologically torturing and then murdering people by entering their homes and breaking them down by making sounds and generally making their presence known. One of the greatest things about this film is, unlike other horror movies, this could actually happen. Someone could actually enter your home and kill you. Probably not as advertised in the movie...but it could definitely happen. Let's see Jason or Michael Myers do what The Strangers did.",The Strangers

I was told that TS would be scary, it wasn't and fell flat as a glass of soda sitting out for hours on a hot day.The introduction was interesting and established some background between James and Kristen, beyond that morsel - utter fiasco. It would probably take 50 million to 'fix' this pile of celluloid, so I won't be holding my breath.Really, do you want to know what this movie is about? It's about a terrorized woman who scrapes through each scene screaming her lungs out. And what lungs they are, surely a gorilla would be impressed. Even in the final scene where she is supposed to be dead, guess what? Yes, she screams her final scream and the credits roll. Perhaps they should rename the film ""The Screamer"".I really don't see what anyone found so good or even scary about TS. If this was your first horror movie I would understand. I especially don't like horror where not one villain gets killed or wounded, yet all the victims die. He had a shotgun damn-it! What went wrong?",The Strangers
264,SubZeroMK,What Halloween and/or Friday the 13th would like if it was this boring,1,2 June 2009,"I had the chance to watch this movie for free on The Movie Network (TMN). The plot moved VERY slow. Then at the end, you think you can see their faces, but this movie FAILS to show their faces, so instead you have to look up the actors on wikipedia, then type their names in a google image search to see their faces.And let's not forget how annoying Liv Tyler was in this movie, I couldn't stand her. The whole ""this is based on true events"" fiasco was meant to do what? Scare us? HARDLY. I was looking for gore, or at least some confrontation between one of the killers, and the victims. But that only happens at the end. I thought we'd see the reasons for them terrorizing the couple and one killer says ""because you were home"" . I get it, they're physco, they kill for no reason.So what separates this horror movie from the rest? It's ****ing boring and pointless. If I wanted to watch a crappy slasher flick,I would of watched the Scream series. Is this ""remake"" supposed to make fun of horror movies today? Or is it some fancy art-house version of a slasher flick? Who knows, and better yet, who cares? Cause I don't. I had to waste 84 minutes of my life on this crap. I realized I could of turned it off, but I kept hoping that I'd see the killers face or some sort of creative murder. It wasn't till the end that I got to see some blood which was boring. Leave the pointless killing to Mickey Knox in ""Natural Born Killers"" . Now THAT is how a horror movie should be made, not like this crap. 1/10 for boring art-house slasher flick.

So I started watching it and the beginning is very stupid. I won't spoil the movie for you but 30 minutes into the film the killers start to haunt Liv Tyler for no apparent reason at all. Thats the one thing that ticked me off The killers attacked them for no reason.Now I know what your thinking what about all the other horror movies out there most of the killers also have no reason for killing people. (NOT TRUE) Ex. Friday The 13th Jason kills people because he believes it is his duty to avenge his mother who was killed by a camp counselor at Camp Crystal Lake. Another example is Halloween, Michael Myers kills people who get in his way while he is trying to kill his baby sister. Now another thing I hated about the strangers was the story.

In all other areas this movie is simply unsatisfying. Like eating an overcooked steak because it's stake, but almost all the enjoyment has been burnt out of it. OK so the bad guys are supposed to be regular people who terrorize and kill just for their own amusement, and have randomly selected this couple as their victims. The movie hints to us that this may have been their first such attack. The bad guys whom we see little of, are two females who appear to be in their mid 20s and an older male who may be early 30s. They all demonstrate near super human abilities and execute their plot with precision akin to military special forces. They are able to be wherever they want whenever they want and absolutely silent if they so choose. Despite their super human abilities, the victims hold the trump card in the form of a shotgun. I am by no means a master of tactics, but when they located the shot shells in the closet, they had absolutely no need to leave the closet. They could have simply let the crazy killers play around outside and in the downstairs, let them sit downstairs and watch old married with children reruns for all you care. There is only one way in and one way out of the closet and the only thing they will get by attempting to enter would be a massive infusion of lead into their body. This is called a choke point, its a very simple concept to understand. Even disregarding this easy way out, the decisions they do make are dumb.

I was not, however, terrible for what it was. It was suspenseful, terrifying, and everything else a film like that should be , at least for the first 30 minutes or so. The build-up does a good job of putting the audience in the perspective of the main characters, which is bleak, sad, and a bit confused. Th beginning of the invasion is truly spooky with the knocking, the girl, the strange going-abouts. Unfortunately one the 'strangers' made contact, the film begins a downward spiral. It looses it's spender in the way only true-crime can. The question is no longer ""What menacing creature is lurking,"" it becomes ""What is this psycho going to do to me?"" Yet through all it's grit and grim, it was not a bad film. I did enjoy the cinematography, direction, and acting in the film.

Sadly there was not enough of it to justify watching the whole thing. As with most movies of this genre there was hope that this might somehow be different or have a twist other than the typical intruder type films. It does not. What is does have is so many illogical decisions by the victims that you likely are happy when they are put out of their misery. The kids finding the aftermath of the intruders reminded me a little of In Cold Blood when the neighbour finds the victims. As with all of the other characters there was no character development other than we are shown that they are very young religious promoters. If you need to learn what not to do if ever in this situation, then this movie would be informative as the victims do everything possible to get themselves killed. It is possible that these two people are just incredibly stupid. As for the killers, they get credited at the end of the movie although you never get to see their faces directly. Anyone could have played their roles as they really don't do anything but stand around until the end when they finally do what they were there for. My other issue with them is that they don't make any noise when they do move around and they seem to be able to disappear in a matter of seconds. Could they be aliens? Impossible to know since we are never given any clue as to why they are doing what they are doing. No backstory or anything. Did they have a reason for wanting this couple dead? Was it just a random thing to waste a few hours? Was there a religious reason for the attacks? Might connect the kids story a little.As there is nothing unique or original about this film I can't recommend it for any reason. Unless you like to see Liv Tyler briefly tied up.",The Strangers

It's not a crime, it's not a fantasy, it is definitely NOT a gore fest, there are no supernatural or 'creatures' that go around terrorizing a whole lot of people. No these are three, very disturbed people. Or they could just be completely bored, who knows, it's not the point. The thing I love most about this movie, is the fact we get two main characters who are real, they're not stupid teenage girls and boys screaming and running around in slow motion, these two characters are believable, and I loved them as if they were my own family. And I hoped SO much that they would survive, even though I know they wouldn't. Liv Tyler... she stunned me so much here, her fear was so real it had me shaking in my seat. She played her emotions with flawless perfection, and throughout this entire movie, I was petrified for her safety.The ending, I have to talk about it so I'm just going to spoil the entire movie for you all...It was by far the most brutal I have ever seen, and I mean ever.Sure you can go watch the guinea-pig flowers of flesh and blood, or even aftermath, and that underground crap. And I have, seen them all. But this, I felt tears building up, because it was so unfair, they were so in love you could tell, just the fact they had the chance to tell each other, and prepare each other for their deaths.

There are so many parts in this film that made the whole audience jump and let out a few screams and the masks on their faces were so freaky! The story is a really good one and i haven't seen a film like it. Yeah there are a few parts where you think what the f**k are you doing but thats the same in any horror/thriller film, the characters are always doing the opposite of what you think you would do. If your a fan of horror films or films that scare you this is well worth a watch. The fact that this really could happen makes it even more scary and you think what the hell would you do in a situation like that, it was just so scary thinking about it.

It takes a simple premise (instead of over-complicating things with super natural B.S. like the movies mentioned in this review's title) and makes it truly frightening. I thrives on simple moments, but those moments are full of intensity and fear. The acting is on point, the script is very real, and it all feels very fresh.

Not once does the camera sit still in this film. It looked good. Well lit. The acting was OK. Populated, however, by the stupidest people ever on both sides of the knife.

Why would I believe you at all? I'm just your husband. Oh hey. There's someone in the house. Well. You wait right here IN the house. I'm going to take the shotgun and go out to the barn and leave you alone and defenseless. OK? Sound good? Cool. See you later honey. Uh Oh. Its the killer. I have a shotgun. He has a flashlight. Better hide. Hmm. Where did my poor excuse for a husband go? Why didn't he come back? I'd better go investigate. Ouch. I hurt my leg. Let me crawl to the barn. Crawl Crawl Crawl. Whew. Made it. Better crawl back to the house. Crawl Crawl. Ooh. The Killer. Get up and run. I'm fine now. Find crappy husband. Lets get away in the car. Oh no. Tires are messed up. The car can't run now at all without tires. Besides. Wouldn't want to hurt the axles or anything. Better hide in the house with the shotgun. Hmmm. Friend arrives. Car is a wreck. Front door open. House in disarray. I bet something is wrong with my friends. I'd better not yell out to see if anyone is OK. Nope. I'd better just sneak in. Sneak around. Be very quite so that I can startle my friend into shooting me with his shotgun. Worked perfectly. I'm dead. I deserve to be dead for being so stupid. And so should my friends.

But I wanted other people to not fall for the hype, and most of the dissenting reviews are from people who have posted no other reviews. And I know for myself, I put no stock in one review comments, whether good or bad.Me having some reviews under my belt, I thought it fell to me, to help give people a real review of this film.Anyone who knows me, knows I'm pretty easy on movies. Heck look at my INDIANA JONES AND THE CRYSTAL SKULL review (http://heroictimes.wordpress.com), I like the film while everyone else wants to lynch it up.So when I tell you THE STRANGERS is one of the few movies I actually walked out on, you'll understand that it has to be pretty bad. If you go by IMDb the reviews would lead you to believe this film was the 2nd coming of SEVEN, when nothing could be further from the truth.The film is just tired and clichéd and annoying. With the characters doing every annoying clichéd thing people do in stupid movies. Don't believe your girlfriend when she tells you someone has been in the house leave her alone while you go on some harebrained scheme and it's supposedly based on a true story, but I'm sure the stupidity is all the filmmakers.I'm sitting in the theater watching Liv Tyler scurry around on the grass, with her butt sticking up and her lips all full and sexy (grrrowwl), and acting terrified, and as much as I welcome any chance to see Liv Tyler's ass in the air... she's too good an actress for this lame piece of garbage.I'm sitting in the theater and I'm bored, and I'm thinking life is too short to spend another second watching this lame piece of offal. I just don't care about it, or how it ended, they live, they die, they move to Mars just didn't care.I just think the film insulted my intelligence with these lame, cliché ridden characters. Particularly the boyfriend annoyed the heck out of me, I didn't care if they lived or died, and just so he would stop annoying me I was leaning strongly toward die, in his case. All in all, a waste of $12 (matinee showing+parking).That 2000+ people on IMDb rate this film by first time director Bryan Bertino, highly enough to get 7+ stars, fills me, like Bush getting elected twice. with dubiousness and more than a twinge of loathing. God we're raising stupid people, that think banality is brilliance.This film is not even worth a rental.It's worth noting a lot of the praise reviews are one time posters, which is usually a film's PR people, trying to drum up support by posting multiple reviews. So as a rule I discount any review by someone, who has no other reviews to their credit.That said I urge you to check out JM Kiff's review, cause he summarizes exactly my issues with the flick, and with the ""praise"" for it.",The Strangers

This year, there are probably half or less horror films that are coming out. The last horror movie that I saw before The Strangers was The Ruins, which was awesome. I'm a big horror fan and I was definitely going to see The Strangers when I saw the trailer.I was very psyched before seeing the movie because I haven't seen a horror movie in a while. What caught my attention the most about the movie was that it is based on true events. Movies that are based on true events or stories always catches my attention, especially horror ones.The Strangers is about a couple Liv Tyler (Kristen) and Scott Speedman (James) who decided to spend a romantic night in house near the woods. Little do they know that three mask strangers are doing whatever they can to ruin the night and gives them a scare they will never forget! If they live! You will probably be asking yourself, who are these three people? And why they are doing this to the couple? But in horror movie, people just want to get scare and that's what I think The Strangers delivers.The Strangers is not actually scary, it is just a jumpy kind of horror movie, but a lot though. What I like about the movie is that is has a lot of suspense and thrills, which I love about horror films.Since we don't really know anything about the 3 mask killers, I thought they were creepy and a little scary too. One thing that I thought was good the way acted was that they were very unpredictable. You didn't really know when they are going to attack.Overall, The Strangers is one of the best horror movies that I have seen in a while and truly it delivers.

Why did I bother carrying on watching it after twenty minutes? All of these questions and more will not be answered by watching this film.",The Strangers
281,harryhoustonastros,Captivating horror,8,28 July 2019,"The strangers has always contained a goodwill in horror due to its wonderful costume design/mask design and creepy visuals.The story here is fairly simple, has some decent jump scares, but the atmosphere is what makes it unique. Home invasion flicks become personal sometimes when you grow attached to the characters. In this case, I wouldn't say that happens, but we become attached to the environment and atmosphere.The ending is truly horrifying and dark. But instead of settling for a happy twist, it shows the horror of the event",The Strangers

283,jbarnes-10,Simple changes could have made this great,6,10 November 2008,"I won't rehash the mound of bad reviews on ""The Strangers"" instead I will offer what I think would be great changes to the film that would have made it truly horrifying.1. I have no complaints about the first half of the film, except I would have liked more dialog between Liv and Scott.2. No running out for cigs. once they are at the house, they never leave.3. No splitting up and no shotgun. The presence of the weapon made the characters seem silly. I think it would have been better with no gun and the entire section with best friend ""Mike"" I would not have done at all.4. The ending. Once Liv and Scott know they will be killed the camera should have panned away, slowly moving backward through the house and out side the now ripped apart front door. You only hear what is going on, therefore your imagination can take you anyplace. In one continuous shot, the camera moves further and further away from the front of house until it is positioned across the main road, then we see cars driving by, so close to help but so far away.5. The Mormon boys are OK and their chance meeting with the strangers, then I would not have shown the boys actually go in the house just standing at the front door, then the 911 call. Now this would leave us to wonder, what happened are they dead? did they torture them or kill them quickly the questions can stay with you a long time. Just some suggestions I think would have approved the final outcome.I like the feel of the film and I thought the strangers were truly horrific, and the fact that their reason was ""because you were home"" is all the reason there needs to be. I think that the age of the viewer has a lot to do with the positive or negative review. Younger people want non stop MTV cutting and masses amount of gore, older people like the horror you don't see or see as much. I think this could have been the new Halloween had it been flushed out, previewed and re-cut.6 for a good first effort.",The Strangers

A house ought to be a secure and calm environment but not anymore, at least, not according to contemporary cinema for this is the third home invasion horror to reach western audiences in the last year or so. Bryan Bertino's ""The Strangers"" is the most mainstream of the three comparable works which is no surprise given the abominable advertising campaign that criminally reveals key plot issues. This is a regular feature in the marketing of horror flicks nowadays as I could list many more that I should have passed on given the trailer told me everything that would happen and even what the resolution would be. Don't watch the trailer for ""The Strangers,"" don't look at the posters and don't even think about reading any review that does not have a note from the critic highlighting their integrity to the movie's secrecy.

285,WebKinect,Fantastic old fashioned horror!,8,5 October 2008,"Its very rare that i comment on a movie although i visit IMDb almost daily but having just watched The Strangers and read some of the negative reviews posted I felt compelled to share my views.The Strangers is old fashioned horror at its best. There's no ghosts, monsters, people being held up in a room an having to saw off their legs to get out or anyone going to Russia or wherever and being taken to a slaughter house, just good old fashioned suspense at its best.What makes this movie great is that this kind of stuff actually happens instead of the over done and unbelievable examples given above. I realise that the movie is based on true events although we all know that doesn't necessarily mean a lot these days. There are some seriously f##ked up people in the USA who actually do this to people and more to often they end up getting away with it. Don't get me wrong, I'm not bashing the USA, there are f##ked up people everywhere but it seems we only hear about it happening in the USA. Despite these things i plan on emigrating to San Fransico when i retire. And being from the UK i've always felt we could learn a lot from our cousins from 'accross the pond'.As for the acting, i thought this was great too. Liv Tyler is amazing. What makes Liv amazing for me is that although i think she is great in pretty much everything i've seen her in she seems impossible to type cast. In this she is totally believable and i felt the terror she portrayed.Scott Speedman is great also. Apart from being the sexiest guy God ever created i will always think of him being in Underworld but in this i nearly didn't recognise him until i saw his amazing mouth, if only that was on the menu when i go out to eat! All in all, if you want a good old fashioned horror which scares you because of the story telling and the acting rather than monsters and special effects then The Strangers is a definite must see!",The Strangers
286,skullballmovies,"Thrilling and mildly realistic, but too goofed up",7,22 July 2010,"The Strangers is one of the more realistic horror/thriller films I've seen recently, but that doesn't mean it's one of the better ones. I really liked how it was built up before the strangers came and got us to sympathize with the characters before the strangers were even around. However, when they started showing up, they added in too many pop-up/jump moments. They were cheap scares and only left me wondering where they were going to pop up next. Other things I disliked were their reactions to things. At first, Kristin got freaked out because she thought people were there. However, once they started making a mess of the house, she only was nervous. Also, at the end, where they're tied to the chairs, Kristin starts screaming 'you don't have to do this' and yelling stop and don't and whatever. Then when the strangers start stabbing James she barely reacts, just nuzzles her face against his. This was upsetting. It was like she was saying 'oh better him than me first.' Still, it was thrilling and somewhat enjoyable. Check it out if you're bored sometime.",The Strangers
287,Absyrd,Because you were home...,8,31 May 2008,"""Torture-porn"" has obviously become common phrase between movie-goers. ""The Saw Series"", ""Hostel"", ""Vacancy"", and ""Wolf Creek"" for example. So along comes ""The Strangers"", just another unmemorable splatter-flick with few scares and little-to-no suspense, right? Well, hardly so, the entire movie was wholesomely entertaining, intense, chilling revel. By far the most daunting, suspenseful, and exuberant film I've seen this year.The film begins with blatant tension between a young couple driving to their summer home in the middle of the night. We shortly come to realize that the man, James, has just proposed to his girlfriend, Kristen, but apparently she declined, claiming she wasn't ready yet. The first 15 minutes of the film center around their melting relationship as they try to put the night behind them and relieve the tautness emerging between them. When James leaves the house to take a breather and muse over what a failure the night has been, Kristen is terrorized by a masked man and in the house, which only begins the night of foreboding horror.When James returns home, he discovers a trepidated Kristen in her bedroom, nearly delirious in terror, and the rest of the film beautifully maintains this atmosphere of dread, with three masked strangers taunting them throughout the house, with the couple desperately trying to reach for help and hide from the seemingly ubiquitous psychopaths. Bertino has successfully placed us in the position of a victim, hammering us as much as he does his prey, involving us with every single movement and sensation. He's a born director of angst and affliction.Recently, there have been numerous horror films that rely mostly on violence and gore, and there've been just as many that rely on suspense, but the directors usually have no idea what they're doing with the latter, and they end up with a film that merely drags and drags and drags until it bleeds stumps. The Strangers is one of the few horror movies I've seen that uncannily mixes both thematics and perfectly constructs a film that isn't tedious nor agonzingly dull. It's always on its feet, never on lockstep motion, and when you catch a glimpse of threat that may break this chain, it's overcome by the director's limitless imagination in the genre.The film holds the premise of a common slasher film, but it's actually quite terrifying, keenly-paced, and executed in such stark and winning manner (certainly helped by Liv Tyler's superb performance, capturing every essence of the word 'panic'), it's hardly comparable to the likes of awful ""dead-teenager"" movies.8.75/10",The Strangers
288,Champion-3,Unbalanced and tedious 70s style 'horror',2,4 June 2008,"Oh great. After years of horror films going over the top with CGI-enhanced gore, it appears that the pendulum has now finally swung back around to the old way of doing things: 'Suspense', 'suspense' and 'suspense' and very little ever actually happening.Too much gratuitous blood and guts swiftly turns horror to comedy, but lack of shock value can also be a bad thing: Undeveloped characters trapped in a house under siege for no purpose whatsoever was crap then and it's crap now.There is almost nothing original about 'The Strangers', and had it been filmed on grainy VT, it could pass for something from the early 1970s, where the only things that made horror films scary was the reputation that they were scary.The film contains just about every cliché of old-school suspense-horror imaginable - masks, stuck vinyl records, peering behind curtains only to find nothing there. It's like the production team took a handful of contrived elements from other films and spun them out in slow motion, relying on the imagination of the viewers to fill in the gaps.I guess everything comes full circle, and it's now the time for a whole host of Living Dead remakes and small-cast unventful suspense flicks.

Is this a joke?The Strangers is not only one of the worst ""horror"" films of all time, it's one of the worst films full stop.Few films leave me as angry as I was when the credits rolled. ""IS THAT IT??!!!"" I thought to myself lividly.It is not in the LEAST bit thrilling, and serves only to frustrate the audience at every turn because the characters are SO STUPID.That's the hallmark of terrible writing.The scenes also drag on for soooo long - letting scenes breathe for tension is fine, but this director doesn't have a clue about good pacing. As a result, it's a complete bore fest.As for Glenn Howerton - what a waste! He had 5 seconds screen time before being offed!We are given NO explanation as to the killers' motives - they just kind of stalk and tease these two dumb characters (who 100% deserved to die for their stupidity alone) - and not even a single moment of catharsis.And don't get me started on the cinematography. Shaky camera, so dark you can't see anything - just abysmal.Absolutely terrible film, deserves NO stars, and should be avoided at all costs. Total waste of time.",The Strangers
290,stiff5,Decent Horror Film,7,3 June 2008,"I've have seen many of the reviews for the new horror film, The Strangers, and after just coming back from seeing it, I think it's safe to say it's not a bad horror film. I heard people on here saying that The Strangers is better than Halloween and The Shining. Not true. The Strangers is good, but not that good. The plot is mostly realistic, making the film pretty damn disturbing and freaky when the credits start rolling. The acting is very believable. The masks were pretty scary, and some of the acts the strangers went through with were crazy. I have to admit, at times I was dug down into my seat with my hand over my mouth, my eyes squinting fearfully, and my teeth gritted tight. This is one of those rare movies that made me look behind me to see if ""anything was there"". Although the film is a shocker, some of the couple's choices of what to do and where to go weren't too smart, and a film that tries to be very realistic needs smart actions. At times, I was in awe about how stupid some of the actions were. But hey, it's a horror movie right? Expected. One of the main problems I had with The Strangers was how long it took for the masked strangers to actually DO SOMETHING. Most of the movie they would show up, taunt them, leave, then show up again, taunt them, leave, then show up again and taunt them again! The cycle continued and I wanted something to happen. So part of me wants to say that it can get very slow at times, therefore changing my opinion of the film a lot. I expected more, but overall the suspense is there for A LOT of the movie, which is very uncommon. The ending is very real and brutal, leaving an uncomfortable tone when it's over. The Strangers is going to have many different after tastes when it's over depending on the viewer's horror movie preferences. The truth is, The Strangers is a decent horror movie. And after hearing that this is the director's first horror film, I was very impressed. Not as good as I would've liked it to be, but we can't all have the whole package. The Strangers is sure to leave viewers startled and scared.",The Strangers

292,blackismylove,I should have stayed home and read a book,2,18 June 2008,"Let me start of by saying that I felt the need to mark this review to have spoilers. But the truth is, there really wasn't anything to spoil! I felt that the movie was trying to ride on the idea that it would be more terrifying for the viewer if they filled in the blanks themselves. Basically this movie had no locations, almost no budget, and most importantly, no plot! It started off promising. I'll admit, I did feel compelled to see what happened next, and during some scenes I became tense. But halfway through the movie I realized I was too impatient for an explanation of anything to be tense. The first half hour was about the relationship issues between the two main characters. Other than introducing them as a couple, the details they went into didn't have any real relevance once the villains made their appearance. The movie goes on to show that the three people who are stalking the main characters have no motive, it never reveals how they get in and out of the house undetected, and depicts them as being completely infallible. Though the acting was believable, the film itself was riddled with cliché situations and reactions. The whole thing could have been about an hour shorter. The most insulting aspect of the whole experience though was that in the beginning of the movie, the narrator explains that it was based on real events. But after some research I found out the only thing that really happened was a situation when the the director was little where someone came to his house asking if someone who didn't live there was home. Turns out the ""based on real events"" factor was just a ploy to get people interested. How insulting.",The Strangers

This movie has all of the things that a good scary movie should. It's suspenseful, creepy, thoughtful and entertaining. I also couldn't help but think of myself in the main characters shoes... and how frightening their situation was. I am not sure if this movie was actually inspired by true events. It claims to be.

In the beginning i was scared a couple of times. But a third of the way through i ceased being scared and I began to wonder why.

The two leads interact with each other in a reasonably realistic manner. No, not entirely realistically - but this is, you know, a MOVIE. A FICTION.We never learn why the ""strangers"" do what they do. So?

(Especially it was quite a challenge to me watch this with headphones at 3:00-4:30am. LoL) And of course, this also follow the ""hidden faces"" -rule like many horror/torture movies. So you never see the faces of the bad guys. I actually hate that.. But yeah, it just ""belongs"" in this genre.Also there's no plot or ideas behind this.

Instead of relying on buckets of gore and an over-contrived premise, it keeps things simple and thats what makes it work. For an hour and a half, the viewer is subjected to a slowly mounting sense of dread that just keeps building without ever pulling back. The story never falls victim to the usual horror movie clichés, but at the same time , it doesn't make any ridiculous attempts to go against them. Perhaps the best thing that the movie has going for it is it's believability. There isn't really any thing to distract the viewer from buying into the premise wholeheartedly.

The only shocking thing about The Strangers is just how astonishingly bad it is.It starts out okay. A young couple comes home to their house after a night out that has revealed troubles in their relationship. Suddenly a stranger knocks at the door at 4 AM in the morning and they go out to open.The stranger, a young woman, asks for Tamara, but there is no Tamara in the house and the couple concludes that she must have gotten the wrong house.The stranger leaves again and the movie suddenly starts to suck. For the next hour and half, the young woman teams up with 2 other strange characters and together they equip cheap masks and big knives to bully the couple in the house. Nobody has the faintest idea of why they would do that and when the woman of the house, on behalf of the audience, questions one of the three masked evil-doers, the only reply is ""Because you're home."" which makes you wonder why of all houses they picked this particular house, seeing as most people across the world are at home at 4 AM in the night.To give the three culprits an edge, the script writer has equipped them with the ability to move instantly and silently, whenever the camera changes angle. He also conveniently decided to cripple the landlines as well as drain the battery of the cellular phones in the movie, leaving our poor couple at the mercy of an ancient radio in the wooden shed which for some mysterious reason is preconfigured to communicate with those nice people at 911.... However, it takes quite a few tries to get the connection going. Too bad one of the thugs from the trio decides to smash the radio with an axe before the help request is delivered. Gosh, now our two friends are totally on their own.Anyway, after goofing around for another hour, acting like pussies and escaping death time and time again, the masked trio finally catches up with the couple and ties them up in their own living room. Disgruntled with the excruciatingly dreary hunt, the masked morons ponder whether or not a death sentence would be appropriate. After pondering for hours while the sun rises they decide to go ahead and they stab both the man and the woman in the stomach with a kitchen knife.The trio dumps their masks and trots out to their van to flee the scene of crime.A few hours later two boys come by the house and discovers the dead couple.Movie ends.Does this sound boring to you?

I was walking in expecting a fake, cheesy attempt at a horror movie. I was walking out with great satisfaction because the movie was anything but cheesy. It's suspenseful and keeps you guessing the whole way through, the acting was very convincing and realistic, and the movie was actually very, very, scary. What makes this movie so scary, aside from the good acting, is that this could happen to anyone. And frankly, it does happen often in the real world. The movies that are realistic are the movies that keep us up at night. They are the movies that truly give us our fear of things like the dark and the feeling of being watched and the feeling of being helpless and alone. This was probably the least recognized horror flick this year, although it's much better than crap like ""The Eye"", ""Shutter"", and ""One Missed Call"". I would compare it in that sense to the 2007 movie ""Wind Chill"", another movie that got no recognition despite being one of last years best horror movies. Overall The Strangers was great.

To start with, when a movie says that it is ""inspired by true events"" I have an extremely hard time believing most of the stuff that is happening in the film. So, in that case I have to say that a lot of the things that went on in this movie did not actually happen, in which case I do not see very many reasons why someone should watch this movie. With that said, there actually are a few reasons, especially if you are a horror movie fan. The Strangers has got to be one of the scariest movies I have ever seen. The suspense in this film was built up in such a way that by mid point in this movie you will be absolutely terrified.

308,dermottferry,somehow it works,7,12 May 2009,"If you were to ask me the one thing I hate about movies, my answer would be this: the amount of stupid horror films that are made nowadays. I think I've only ever seen one great horror movie, The Blair Witch Project, and I've been greatly disappointed over the amount of times I've sat down to a horror only to be left disappointed. So when I sat down to watch The Strangers, I wasn't very optimistic. But I was in for a surprise. Two lovers terrorised in an empty house. Doesn't sound great at all, but in some level, this film worked for me. Im not saying its a great movie, but I do think its a very good one. Some of the scenes are quite creepy and well done, and the suspense levels are very high for the majority of the film. All I can say is don't be put off by many of the negative reviews here, I would encourage you to watch it, because it is satisfying viewing. One of the best horrors I've seen in a while, just when I thought the genre was dead.",The Strangers
309,ericjams,"Starts with a Bang, but Fails to Maintain",6,15 June 2008,"I went to see The Strangers with no background information, just a quiet night, random movie going experience. I knew it was a horror/mystery...thats it. The movie starts slow, but is intriguing nonetheless. We have a small amount of character development with our protagonist couple before things get hairy. As to the suspense, I really liked some of the subtle techniques used in this movie. Hand-held camera work, and a great score that combined eeriness with some old country tunes that worked to create a great tense atmosphere in the theater. This movie starts on par with the scare factor of good Japanese/Korean movies...however. The actual plot is what left me desiring more. The set never changes. We are in a house and on the property where the protagonists are terrorized by ""the strangers"" the entire movie. We know the ending as its told to us in the 1st 5 minutes. And ultimately, the scare tactics used early on -the freakishness of being home alone with home invaders who have infiltrated your house, bang and break things, and wear freaky masks -- wears off after awhile. I mean the ""strangers"" more or less toy with the victims for 100 minutes. After awhile, the movie needs something else to happen because the impending doom is no longer that impending, I no longer believed we'd see the strangers engage the couple until the requisite 110 minutes of airtime had expired. So the tension is lost and the audience just waited for the conclusion which we all knew. Additionally, there is no tension/release with this movie, the director tries to keep the tension going throughout and ultimately the sails lose the wind. There is no back story, and very little dialogue. The introduction of peripheral characters is short lived, there is never any explanation about the ""strangers"" -their reasons/objectives/personalities, the decisions the couple make in combating the ""strangers"" are idiotic, and by the end when you are hoping for a final horrific conclusion, the movie gives you nothing more than the visual of the foregone conclusion.I jumped out of my seat a few times, and I was a bit 'freaked out' walking to my car through the fog on a quiet street that evening. But this movie was only inspired by true events, meaning the script did not have to adhere to a factual event. Thus there is no excuse for the weak plot. All the atmospherics needed for good suspenseful horror -read-not-torture-porn- were in place, but the plot needed more ingenuity and ultimately failed as do so many other horror movies in assuming that because you succeed in creating a scary setting you can pass off idiotic human decisions without the audience questioning them.",The Strangers
310,pahaake,Really not a total waste of time,5,29 August 2008,"OK, so no - I didn't like this movie enough to comment on it, but I read a 1 star review and thought I'd throw in my $.02 US.I will defend Liv Tyler, she is simply awesome - and for that fact I gave this movie a 5 - it's all Liv 5, without her would have been a 2 or a 3.I got a few cheap scares out of it, but yes the main characters act like morons - they do stupid things like everyone in every other slasher / horror flick.It was definitely a movie worth a rental once you've rented everything else and if you like Liv. If you don't - you may not want to bother.",The Strangers
311,randolphpat,No Twist or Format,3,7 November 2013,"This film fails both at being a good formulaic slasher vehicle, or horror thriller with a twist at the end. Liv Tyler who has never really shown any acting chops, plays a ridiculously easy victim in this film, the other characters are just as forgettable. The hurt boyfriend, the enshadowed stranger who knocks on the door and asks for someone who is not there. The buddy of the male protagonist, no one is memorable in this movie.There is really no chemistry between the members of the leading couple. I'd like to think it may have been a victim of bad editing, but the film runs only 71 minutes sans end credits so god knows there was plenty of room to squeeze in a scene that might make the audience identify with the main characters.There was a scene in the beginning of the movie that began to provide some background, but kept cutting us short. Even the voice-over in the beginning explained the film was based on true events, but ""know one really knows what happened."" One of the victims survived the ordeal, wouldn't she know? Just a terrible movie in every way.",The Strangers
312,Soucriant,Could have been worse and it could have been A LOT better,6,3 September 2008,"I was anticipating ""The Strangers"" for quite some time. A good psychological thriller that relied on suspense and skillful direction rather than gratuitous blood and violence, was and still is, exactly what Hollywood horror needs in order to redeem itself amongst die-hard horror fans.The Strangers doesn't completely fail here, but it doesn't run away with the prize, either. It relies on suspense and atmosphere, sure. The plot revolves around a; ""This could happen to you"" situation. Fine.The problem is the formula and the way in which it's executed. Home invasion type films get to me. So I admit that when one of the Strangers first started banging on the front door, I was a little freaked out. Likewise when the masked man first appears.This was a GOOD set-up, which the director should have built upon to increase the tension and the audience's fear. But as other reviewers have stated; he doesn't. He simply uses the same methods and tricks over and over again.It soon becomes clear to the viewer that these ""Strangers"" aren't just here to kill the two leads. They want to play with and terrorise them. Nothing wrong with that, it's my kind of thing. But when the most that's happened in an HOUR is the man in the mask jumping at a window and walking around the house, while, (what I presume to be), his two daughters stand at the end of the driveway and lurk in the trees REPEATEDLY, you have to start asking yourself if there's a rhyme or reason to this.In these three Strangers we have a subdued version of the Firefly family on our hands. They avoid directly confronting the couple they're harassing and they don't speak until the end of the film. So I was both surprised and relieved when just past the hour mark; Father Stranger hurled Liv Tyler into the wall, busting her head open on a picture.After that, we get quite a gutsy ending from a mainstream produced horror flick. I certainly preferred it to the ever so overused: ""Heroine finds strength from within and fights back."" Also, a nice closing line.So, I didn't hate The Strangers by any means. There is a lot of promise in there, and I'd watch it again without hesitation. I was just looking for that bit ""more."" A great premise with interesting and different villains. The envelope just wasn't pushed far enough.",The Strangers
313,MsGoreXale3723,Scary!!!,9,12 July 2008,"I went to see this movie tonight and I had to comment. It was truly scary. An intense film that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The 1st 15 min. of the film gives you a little info on the main characters (but not much) then doesn't hold back. It is very terrifying. The best part about this film is that it doesn't rely on CGI and such to scare. The idea of being randomly terrorized is a scary premise and this premise is used effectively in this film The acting was equally as effective. I am a huge horror/thriller fan. They have been my favorite movies since I was a child (back when they made good horror/thrillers) and I have been disappointed with the recent so called horror movies (has anyone seen ""The EyE""?). I came out of this movie with hope that there are still filmmakers that know how to keep true to the genre. I highly recommend this film. I do suggest that you see it with someone as I went by myself and I was afraid to walk to my car and I am still scared! But I loved it.",The Strangers
314,ciaron-07058,Because you were home,8,21 December 2018,I really enjoyed this movie. Little background information on the victims and no information on the killers. Just a random couple being at attacked by some murderers. It kept me at the edge of my seat because I constantly felt that something was going to jump out.There are areas of the film that could have been better. Why couldn't they just sit in the closet with the gun all night? Even after killing their friend. It would have been enclosed so there was only one way in and out and they had their gun close by.I think too many horror movies these days move in the direction of trying to scare us with things that don't exist. I get more scared by things that do exist and these killers could be the type of person you spend your day working with and then they do this at night. They could just be normal people that enjoy stabbing random victims in their homes. That's what I find scary!,The Strangers
315,movieman430,"Good suspense, Big Anticlimax",6,30 May 2008,"The Strangers is the kind of movie that works incredibly well until half way through. Bryan Bertino came up with a very effective premise, then struggled to make it come together into a cohesive whole and came up short. The Strangers opens with Kristen (Liv Tyler) and James (Scott Speedman), returning home from a friend's wedding. Earlier in the evening, James had proposed to her and she said no, Thus they are very distant towards each other. The rest of the film is them facing off against three anonymous, mask wearing killers who terrorize them. I applaud the way Bertino handles the majority of this film. Despite some stiff acting against equally rigid dialog, the acting is passable for a suspense horror film. The power of the movie is allowing the masked stalkers to be omnipresent, creating powerful tension. The film is shot well and there are moments that leave you on the edge of your seat. He uses the gore incredibly sparingly, allowing it to remain incredibly effective. The problem is the third act. Even at a running time of 90 minutes, The Strangers seems to drag on a bit. The stalkers appear roughly 20 minutes into the movie, so we're left with roughly 75 minutes of creeping around a house to ominous tones, and occasionally old western music. It gets a little repetitive and because of the nature of movie there is no break. The great part about build up, is the pay off. The Strangers feels like it's building up to nothing. There is nothing to do but look around that next corner and pass by the man barely visible in the shadows. Going into the third act of the film we get more of the same. Some people are going to love the ending of this movie, most people are going to hate it, some people are going to be torn. I'm the later. I don't like the ending, however it does fulfill three essential horror movie requirements. 1. Blatantly show that the victims have grown in someway, and make us care about them again just enough for us to be interested in the final confrontation. 2. Leaves room for the essential ""final scare"". 3. And perhaps most importantly, leaves room for a sequel. That being said, the ending isn't overly satisfying. In the end, The Strangers is a refreshing throwback to suspense movies that rely heavily on music, atmosphere, and uses the camera to tell the story. Most horror films use gore as a crutch to keep the audience interested, The Strangers moves away from this, although it misses the mark a little bit. If you want to spend 90 minutes filled with decent suspense, and don't plan on thinking about it once you leave the theatre, The Strangers might be the movie for you. However, if you plan on taking a step back, realizing the simplicity of the plot, and then wondering why the film makers could not package it into a cohesive whole, you might want to say away.",The Strangers
316,tonywebman,Contrived exploitation film that was just plain stupid!,1,3 June 2008,"May contain vague spoilers but not really. Besides, if you're thinking about seeing this movie #1 don't, #2 any spoilers you may find here (or anywhere else) won't ruin the movie for you since it's so full of plot holes and is so poorly written that they just won't matter. If you are looking for a cleverly conceived, well written movie with plausible situations that will creep you out and give you genuine scares... look somewhere else. This movie will only appeal to those with little appreciation for quality horror and are just looking for cheap thrills. In other words, if you think a guy with a burlap bag over his head who wheezes worse than Darth Vader is scary then this movie is for you. There are so many trite and contrived attempts at eliciting tension in this movie that after a while I started to yawn and look around the dark theater looking for something more interesting like maybe some gum stuck to my shoe. A typical example is the old, cliché ""you stay here by yourself while I wander around outside for a while"" routine. Yes, this NEVER gets tired even though it's been in just about every teen slasher horror movie ever made... and this is just scratching the surface. This movie is bad because it's just plain dumb and I am only writing this because somewhere people are producing crap like this and making money off of it. This is the real horror behind this movie! Avoid at all costs. Better current options are ""REC"", ""The Orphanage"", or anything else.",The Strangers

Most of these killer movies don't scare me but this one did because it is a true story. Liv Tyler is great in the movie and rest of the cast are very good actors as well. The scary part of this movie - there are really people out there just like the killers in the movie. The group has a chance to kill the bad guys but everything that can go wrong goes wrong. They end up killing one of their own by mistake and the bad guys get away Scott free. At the end of the movie - the killers calmly ride away into the sunrise while Liv is left for dead.

I don't feel it's the viewers job to over extend themselves and make-up an entire storyline as a justification if the film maker has been lazy enough not to give you enough prompts.You don't watch a film just for the premise of a psychological thrill, suspense, and fright, without a proper ending - because to tie up the film somewhat, is to put the icing on the cake - without that, the 'cake' is not complete.There is a scene in this film where you will, within a second of a particular event taking place, know exactly what is about to happen. It is after this point that you just stay with the wanton violence in the hope that there is reasoning at the end - but there isn't.This film isn't worth the 6.8 it's currently got.Thankyou",The Strangers
322,patricklewallen,This film might be too real for what I wanted,7,30 June 2008,"Going into the film, I was excited to see a horror flick that seemed to have a little more potential than others, including Liv Tyler, who has proved that her acting is above that of a typically cast female in a horror film. She did not disappoint. Both leading characters acted their parts with absolute ease and committed to their roles. As with any horror movie, there are occasional holes in the script, including questionable motivation, victim idiocy, unmentioned villain sloppiness, etc. However, these aspects of the film can be easily dismissed, because they do not hold enough water to matter in this type of film. The film begins in a very unique fashion, different than most films of a similar genre. The part for me was found towards the ending scenes of the film. This is the type of film that can become far TOO REAL. Normally, I'm all about realism used in horror pictures, but for some reason, this one had an undesired effect on me. Just be warned that this movie might strike you in a way you were not expecting, which might be good for some, but for the crowd I was with, it was not a good thing. It almost forced me to give a poor star rating on IMDb because I didn't like the feelings I was having. I held off though. After a week, I have decided to post my rating and write the words that I thought would be appropriate having reflected on the film. Would I recommend this film to someone? Despite the above average rating I gave this movie, I feel I must be honest. No. I do not recommend this film. It's a good movie, but just a little too brutal. Overall rating: B-/C+",The Strangers
323,therefdotcom,a horror film for people that don't actually enjoy horror films,1,20 August 2008,"inspired by the high IMDb rating and being a huge horror film fan i went out to watch this yesterday and i was surprised beyond belief about the actual film.the plot synopsis sounded rather fair and the cast was interesting as well. also i found the masks of the attackers compelling so i thought there could not go much wrong with a little bit off directors passion and an at least mediocre script. well, there i was wrong.what bothered me first was that they started off with a side-plot that at a certain point into the movie stops. i guess it was meant to gather some sympathy for the main characters AKA victims, but for me this attempt failed. after 30 minutes into the movie i still did not care for the couple and i was slowly beginning to get bored as none to nothing happens in this film. approximately 60 minutes into the film still not much happened except for some panic and some b-movie typical screaming from liv tyler.also, at this point the whole thing started to remind me of the movie them (http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0465203/) which at this point (60 minutes) already had me totally in its fangs, a total opposite of this movie. the main differences are that this movie plays in a much safer environment and that the victims in ""them"" seem to fight for their life the victims in ""the strangers"" just run and scream around in panic.another reference that is obvious i michael hanekes's film funny games and if ""the strangers"" would have been released before ""funny games"" then one could have the impression that this was the actual movie haneke was criticizing as an example what is wrong with the Hollywood industry.anyway, 60 minutes is still not the end and an amazing conclusion can safe nearly every movie, so stayed.unfortunately there wasn't much coming after that. ultra-simple conclusion,no twist, no surprise, no whatsoever.basically the conclusion was the same as with ""them"" which was written after this movies script, but directed and released long before this movie was even in production so basically, this is one of those typical bad Hollywood remakes of a great European movie.basically there is 90 minutes of nothing happening at all.as an art-house film fan i am missing the plot here. as a horror film fan i am missing suspense, storyline, basically everything. in general as a movie fan i am missing the sense here. why would anybody enjoy watching this? the rating to me is an absolutely wonder and kinda sad actually.",The Strangers

325,drylungvocalmartyr,Home is not safe anymore,8,12 October 2008,"As a big fan of the genre I prefer horror films that show less and leave much more to the imagination. If you are into this type of stuff, The Strangers is your movie. Maybe it's not the most original flick out there but it uses the gimmicks of the art to great effect.Last year's 'Vacancy' offers a good point of comparison because of the similarities in storyline: a young couple with problems in their relationship ends up at a remote house only to fall into the hands of some very disturbed individuals. But the resemblance ends here: 'Vacancy' is sort of okay, but it does not leave a lasting impression.The Strangers however stayed with me for days afterwards and I know that some of its scenes and lines (""Because you were home"") I will never forget. It's much scarier than 'Vacancy' and its villains are a lot more menacing, too. It is because we never get to know who they really are or what motivations they have. The masks hide their true identities and their intentions remain unexplained. I like the idea that even if they shed their masks in the end we still not really see their faces. Not knowing by whom and why you are about to lose your life is one maddening prospect indeed.I think one reason why the movie works so well is that it takes time to introduce our protagonists. Getting to know what happened between them brings them closer to us and thereby they become people to root for and not just victims that we don't care about as is the case with a lot of contemporary horror movies. Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman not only look good together; they are able to portray a relationship that looks real, which is not too common in the genre. Because we care for them it is much easier to put ourselves in their shoes and thereby the 'it could happen to us' aspect works better, too.Another thing to mention why the film worked is that our protagonists were attacked at their (summer) home not at a cheap motel or at some other impersonal location. Home is supposed to be safe and when this image is shattered and you start thinking about how safe you really are at home, it's terrifying to realize how vulnerable we are to evil.Maybe it's a little far-fetched to state and Alfred Hitchcock would surely say it's only a movie but I still think that good horror films are reflections of our times and the anxieties we face and The Strangers touches on some of these really well and thereby not only giving a memorable movie experience but some food for thought as well.",The Strangers

I found myself jumping, looking around the theater and when I got home I was looking in the closets for masked intruders.

And - to a degree, it works. But, like many movie trailers, it is very misleading, well to me it was.From the trailer I thought this would be something like 'Funny Games', but it turns out to be your average horror/slasher movie. The scenes from the trailer ie. the family of masked assailants are shown in this way for about a good 10 seconds.The main problem with this movie is the lack of 'who' and 'why'. OK, we learn a little about the 2 lead characters, from the movies 'this is what happened cos it's a true story' thing at the beginning, and a few scenes of 'this is what happened before they got were they are'. For the 2 main characters, this is enough. The assailants however, have no motive, no identity and pretty much nothing is told about them. They just kinda kill people! I've seen b-movies with better reasons for bad guys.On a good point, Liv Tyler does a great job...ye she's limited to screaming for her fella and hiding in closets...but she does it well6/10 cheap scares, nothing specialAnd finally a message to Jason Kiff.

Throughout the whole movie I'm like ""Who the f*ck is Tamara"". We never find out. The thing I hated most about the movie is that the masked strangers outsmarted the two.

The scene where James and Kristen are hiding in the closet, a friend walks into the house, James mistakes him for one of the strangers and blasts him in the head with a shotgun.

There is more to creating fear than squirting blood everywhere: suspense, the unknown, no reason as to why, shadows in the dark and the old adage...""things that go bump in the night"" are in full swing in the fright-fest. I really wouldn't say it was a ""horror"" movie per say...more like terror!. Anyone who does see this movie and is not at least shaken or disturbed not even by the slightest...have become so desensitized by the gore fest going on that they wouldn't know fear if it bit them on the rear.It was tense, suspenseful and the terror level over 10. A must see for anyone who loves to be scared. I have read some other comments dissing this movie and I would love to ask these people...""Do you think YOU could actually make a better horror movie that actually scares? With hardly any blood? If so, I would like to see it. But don't try and copy anything out of this movie...you have to use your OWN imagination."" I am sure no one could or would raise to the occasion.Truly a terrifying road trip I won't be taking again for quite some time. I am not as young as I used to be. But, I loved it!",The Strangers

336,kchintogtoh,This movie is bad.,1,18 May 2017,Hello this is the first time I'm commenting on movie. I wasn't planning to but after seeing so many positive reviews I couldn't help but to leave a comment. Actors were kinda good. But directing. It was really really bad. And I don't understand why so many people left positive reviews. It's waste of time. Starting build up was kinda promising but the script left the earth and people acted like puppets.,The Strangers
337,Hythlodaeus,Excellent Subtle Horror,8,13 June 2008,"In some ways this movie was predictable and boring. In other ways it was truly just subtle but well done. Yeah, scenes like a guy smashing through a door aren't subtle but the movie used a lot of simple yet very effective tricks to keep the audience on their toes for the entire movie. I'm a horror veteran but me and everyone else in the theater jumped and laughed nervously throughout the whole film and virtually all the women screamed loudly and often. I don't think this movie is destined to be a horror classic but it might be. it was fun - just the same way a roller coaster is - quick fun then it's over. However, my wife disagreed - she said she wasn't gonna sleep a wink tonight!",The Strangers
338,atlanticcanuck,"A few good jolts, but not a classic by any means.",5,11 June 2008,"This movie delivers a couple of really good scares. But the scares are more in line with computer pop ups then chill inducing suspense. You know what I mean, a moment of calm followed by a LOUD NOISE and the shot of one of the Strangers. Therefore, over all it does not leave you feeling the same way you may have felt when you left Halloween or Aliens say. It is not edge of your seat full throttle suspense.Another issue I had was the way the characters acted. In short, they continue to make really bad decisions. I just hope that if ever I am faced with such a situation, I keep some of my common sense about me and not just run off madly in all directions. Once I had that shotgun, I would have been marching down the road blasting anything that crossed my path. In this movie, the victims do not even wound one of their attackers.And that brings me my last piece of criticism: the ending is just too nihilistic. By that I mean it is cold. Sure it is creepy and leaves you thinking; sure it is probably more realistic as to what would really happen, but the payoff of watching someone get terrorized in a slasher film is that at some point the hunted becomes the hunter. There is no ""payback is a bitch"" scene in this film. I do not always want my films to end happy, but in this case, I wanted the bad guys to get their due.So! Over all, I am glad I went to see it and I enjoyed getting knocked out of my seat from time to time. (I still have the claw marks in my arm from where my wife squeezed through.) However, it would not be on my list of top 10...or even 20.",The Strangers

There are very few movies that leave you almost shocked -- even when the ending is just, eh.The Strangers did a perfect job, up until the end. The actors were good and I was officially scared for the both of them, but also felt a good untrusting fear that one of them was causing this. When i was over that, i then thought there were ghosts...I believed it. There was something new and authentic about having these masked bandits destroy a horrible night and make it into something horrifying. The two leads were perfect and acted as anyone, making this believable.What really ticked me off is when the male lead 'left' the female lead and she was okay with that. HI. You are being watched by some lunatics and ya'll do what you NEVER do when being stalked by *anyone* -- always stick together!!!

342,ricsim78,Insults one's intelligence.,1,11 January 2009,"Not only was this a boring, campy, pointless movie....the characters are so dumb they deserve to die: Liv Tyler has a phone yet instead of calling the police she calls her man (where the heck did he go, anyway?) The car gets smashed windows and flattened tires yet neither hear it happen even though it is quiet outside and it is a secluded house. The blonde girl seems to have the ability to teleport. The guy does not even know how to use the shot gun, yet managed to hit his buddy with a direct head shot immediately as he comes into view from a blind corner. Plus, he is searching small book shelves for a full size shotgun that obviously would not fit. This is just an example of the stupidness you will endure watching this movie! The ads looked good, and I wanted to see it is theaters but missed my chance, so was excited when it came out on video. That and the ""inspired by true events"" moniker made me want to see it more. Guess what? This story was ""inspired"" by the director having someone ding dong ditch his house. That is the ""true story"" that ""inspired"" this ""movie"". This made me more mad then the pointlessness, unbelievably dumb characters, and lack of explanations this movie gives! Quite clever, really.There is no point, the ""Strangers"" are portrayed as real people with sacks over their heads, yet seem to be able to predict every (dumb) action the characters do, know locations of phones and smoke detectors, and seem to be able to teleport and destroy cars silently, sneak in and out of the house undetected.I would not recommend this movie to anyone, even with people who have like brainless movies, this one is still to sure upset you!

343,J_M_Kiff,What a waste of time,1,29 May 2008,"*** Warning *** Spoilers *** For such a short film, this managed to cram in every senseless cliché of the so-called horror genre. '...Girl runs from bad guys, girl trips, girls falls and hurts herself, girl whimpers, duh...' No character development, no depth, no sympathy for the characters. '... bad guys are harassing your house and threatening you, so OF COURSE you get hysterical, cry, and seek out every spooky noise...' So bad guys are hacking at your front door with an ax, you've got a loaded shotgun in your hand, but you don't shoot, you throw a chair at the door, Oh Wait, I've got a gun! But by the time you think to shoot the bad guys are gone. So your under attack from bad guys and it's just you, your girlfriend, and a loaded shotgun, so instead of hunkering down and letting them come to you to get shot, you leave your girlfriend alone in the un-secured house while you wander off to the tool shed to find and old ham radio. Sure, makes sense. So you go visit your friends and someone shoots out your windshield, do you: A- drive off fast and call 911, B- call 911 then run in the house to check on your friends, or C- dust yourself off, sneak into the house quietly, without ever bothering to wonder why your friend's car is wrecked, who's pickup truck that is, why the house is trashed, don't bother turning off the loud stereo, or calling out your friends' names, in fact don't even bother to look behind you to see if maybe the people who shot out your windshield are still around. That's right - C !?!Everyone who died in this movie deserved to die for being such mindless, spineless, insipid, whimpering idiots. Maybe if you've never seen a movie before, ever, or if you've had recent head trauma, or maybe if you're Amish this movie might scare you. Maybe. Don't waste your time or money.REVISION::: it's now Sunday 6/1. I originally posted the above comment after an advance screening of this movie late-night on thursday 5/29 (because I work at a movie theater I get to see all the movies before they're released.) So I've noticed something peculiar... there are, as of now, about 8 pages of comments on this film. About 3 pages of comments before mine (meaning before the movie came out) all gave The Strangers 9 or 10 stars, glowing reviews, and taglines like ""best horror movie ever,"" ""scariest film ever,"" and ""awesome."" But then, if you look at the dates of submission, 95% of all the comments posted after the movie was released say it's lackluster at best, anticlimactic, boring, lame, and not worth watching. So, I wonder, is that a coincidence, or maybe, just maybe, were all those people who posted great comments prior to the movie's release doing it for some other reason? Were they being paid to hype the film? Do they work for the production company? Or is it all just a big coincidence? Hmmm....",The Strangers
344,bootderek,More of a mystery than a thriller,5,3 January 2009,"I'll admit there were a few points in the film where I nearly jumped out of my seat. But this film is still almost south of decent. There were quite a few things wrong with it. For one thing, there is close to no explanation as to who any of the characters are. I mean, are the protagonists friends? Do they have jobs or more than one friend? Who are the strangers? What connection do they have to the protagonists and what is the reason for hunting them down, traumatizing them, torturing them? Nothing is explained in this movie, except for what the strangers represent: people in masks are usually not meant to be trusted. But that's it. The camera work is pretty off in most of the scenes, and only one of the three strangers has an actual speaking role. How indecent is that? Sure, hunting down someone while wearing a mask without a voice is scary enough, but still. There are way too many plot holes, and I want to add that I would've been more impressed if the events had taken place for more than just a single day or night. Because of all the problems and weirdness of it all, the movie falls into my mystery category than horror, because that is only shown in two scenes: when the friend of the guy is unintentionally shot and when the protagonists are stabbed to death. So yeah, I wouldn't exactly call this a horror film. One last thing: why did the woman wake up again in the end when she was really dead? That was never explained. Somewhat indecent, mysterious thriller that is only interesting on a low level.5/10",The Strangers
345,drumsolodub,Pitiful and predictable,4,8 June 2008,"Now I must begin by telling you that I am not a fan of the contemporary horror genre. Too many of the latest movie makers believe that blood and gore equate to horror and terror. WRONG!! In my opinion it takes a very clever movie maker to create a great horror movie...creating a feeling and anticipation of horror and terror without truly taking the short cut by replacing intelligent movie making with blood and gore. SO, when I read about this movie I thought OK, maybe this will be the movie to change my mind on the ""new"" semi-intelligent movie makers. I was *so* wrong about this movie. Granted the blood and gore is kept to a minimum but come on guys at least give us some character development, a plot line, create the illusion that you actually have the ability and creativity to make a quality film.The supposed horror and terror plot points are nothing more than the old standbys...""open the door or curtain and *boom* there is a shocking face...or ""hey, what's that noise"" kind of kindergarten terror routines. When a truly gifted and creative movie maker makes a truly creative horror movie then perhaps I will become a fan of the genre again. But this movie is not that movie.

As others have stated, it starts out well, and then descends into nothing rather rapidly. Whereas Them/Ils is a little masterpiece in building nail biting suspense and Funny Games is, at least, thought-provoking, The Strangers mostly reminds one of Vacancy in non-existing suspense. Plus the ending is stupid. Some reviewers said that the lack of motif bothered them, which really isn't an issue for me; I don't mind ""making up"" the background myself, but that's all a matter of taste. This movie could have needed a good twist. The 2 stars is only for some creepy moment within the first 25 minutes, and for the rather small cast that did a not great, but acceptable job.",The Strangers
347,Pop2Dog,Worst movie I've seen in a long time,1,2 June 2013,"Where do I start with this crap?Watching this was like watching lead settle. It was awful. Anyone who says this was scary, needs to watch more movies. It wasn't scary at all. It starts out dull and ends dull, with a ton of dull in the middle.At about just over halfway through, you start to want at least SOME exposition as to why the people are trying to kill them. Just a little, you get NOTHING. They are wearing some ""Ooooh, look at me I'm wearing a silly mask, I'm so ironically scary, oh, how post-modern of me"" masks, that just look so hacky and pretentious at the same time.The complete lack of any kind of explanation is incredibly annoying. The ending is boring, and sets up the possibility of a sequel, which I hope they don't make. Two movies of s**t like this should be a capital crime.This movie is the directors failed attempt at making an interesting movie- interesting by means of making you think. However they give you nothing to think with. Just dull, pretentious characters (who under 50 years old people listens to that stupid music they listen to anymore?!? It's just there as an attempt to create an ""odd"" atmosphere. It doesn't work.)It could be the most boring film I have ever seen.EDIT: I have to address some comments from other reviews on here about this garbage movie.""The masks and the idea of not being able to see the faces made the movie unique.""Yeah, right. People wearing masks in horror movies is ""unique"" to this movie. Halloween, Friday the 13th, to name just 2 are actually figments of my imagination...

Pretty much right off the bat the ""scary"" begins to happen, so it's almost a 2 hour cat and very stupid mice game. As a viewer, you don't know anything about the masked intruders except that they walk around the house making noise and emerge out of shadows.Acting: There was no chemistry between scott and liv. Pure and simple. When you've got two actors in a 2 hour film, it has to be believable that they are in love, or even get along.Writing: very green writing. Its know that the direct has really only done a few attempts at screenplays and it shows. The disclaimer in the beginning wasn't needed and was somewhat confusing given the ending to the film.In all I'm glad I used free movie passes to see it, or else I would've gone and got my money back about 30 minutes in.I suggest waiting for it to be on TV, or renting it in a few months.

But this is different.This is why I give that genre a chance to do its job right: suspense. Horror movies should not be about tons of gore and gallons of blood splattering but about gripping suspense. Important are the actors, since they need to act as if they were in the same fear in which we would be in their place. Liv Tyler definitely is. Great job on the acting, loads of suspense is delivered.Then at some point, you want it to be all over, as fast as possible. Not because you don't like it! But because the victims want it to be over as well. They are scared.So are you.I recommend you to watch this ""open ended"" suspense-movie during a quiet, dark night.Note: The movie keeps you away from thinking straight, I have to admit though, when it is all over you first try to understand the motivation of the criminals, then you think about the severe logical mistakes the character in the movie made.

He's planned a night on the town in his hometown, which ""uh oh"" is a sleepy and dark haven in the woods. They stay at his family's old place. There is rose pedals and good champagne. Finally, he proposes and she says ""No.""It's four in the morning when Kirsten says. ""I'm just not ready."" So, I guess, for this hopeful bachelor this may not be the end.

It's disturbing, but it's already been one hell of a night. And they really don't think much of it. James leaves to get cigarettes. Kristen walks around in an abysmal daze. We're left to wonder about their future. It's a choice premise for any movie, really, and we forget we're watching a horror film. That's when the mask appears outside the windowThe ominous lighting captured by Peter Sova, (The Proposition), is essential to the execution of this film, as it not only narrates the troubling story of this couple, but also foreshadows the doom and terror that ensues. From here, more masked villains appear and trap her in the house. They taunt and torture her. We're left to wonder if James will return or if he's somehow behind this. Without giving too much away, that's basically the rest of the movie. The antagonists and their intentions might remain mysterious throughout which would be fine, but one problem is we never discover anything else about our heroes. Everything we learn about them is within the first twenty minutes The Strangers starts as a slow burn and then boils quickly. It wraps up within ninety minutes and while it isn't as a complex or tantalizing as say Funny Games, it's still absolutely watchable and a perfect rental for the Halloween season.",The Strangers

A figure obscured by the shadows, asks if Tamera is home. Upon telling her that she has the house, she leaves. James decides to drive into town for a pack of cigarettes, and leaves Kristen alone (to quote Zoey from Left 4 Dead, a cabin in the middle of nowhere, I've seen this movie before). After James leaves, a knock comes again from the front door. The same girl who came by earlier is back and asks again ""Is Tamera home?"" Once again is told she has the wrong house, she leaves again. But then Kristen hears another loud BANG on the door, like someone slamming something heavy against a the door. Thus begins a night of terror that will push Kristen and her lover far beyond what they thought they were capable of.Afterword: Forgive the poorly written basic story guide, but it was the only way to avoid major spoilers. Sorry.Verdict: I saw the trailer, and I instantly wanted to see it. I truly was enticed, and thought it would be a really good slasher flick. Which is why I now believe in what Otis Driftwood said in The Devil's Rejects: ""Keep your expectation low, that way you are never disappointed."" And this movie disappointed me more than the third Scream installment , which was a BIG let down.For a horror movie, it is not scary. It maybe has one part in it that will make you jump and get your adrenaline pumping. And that is a huge let down. For a slasher film, it's not very bloody. One scene of blood in a slasher flick is not enough for blood-thirsty horror move fans, such as myself. There was more blood in 1960's Psycho in the shower scene than in this entire movie (oh um...spoiler alert?). Also, this movie is depressing. From the get go, it's just depressing knowing that James' marriage proposal is rejected, and the overall opening few scenes are boring. It just never really picks up.But for some reason that I cannot explain, it is strangely watchable, but only when I really want to watch something that is different or have seen all of my other movies and slasher flicks and need a break from the same movies.5/ 10",The Strangers
356,lucyrichards27,A nail-biting horror with plenty of scares that really hits home what can happen in everyday life.,8,2 July 2012,"This movie is great. It really sets the tone from the beginning with the seemingly broken down relationship between James Hoyt (Scott Speedman)and Kristen Mckay(Liv Tyler), the darkness of the scenes, the mellow, eerie music, the innocence of the characters both appearance and characteristic wise, and the flickering candles/house smothered in rose petals. The beginning has a very sad feel to it which could be said to add to a sense of a 'hybrid movie' - in this case it's a horror-romance movie. You immediately sympathise with the couple, especially if you've been in love which I have, and you have ever desperately wanted it to work but it won't.When the first sign of action comes, it comes in the form of hard banging on the door. All the 'villains' in 'The Strangers' don't say much, have a very low tone, little body movements and a variety of masks - a straw bag, a doll mask etc. This really adds to the eerie tone. The horror comes from not non-stop action, but the fact that the people committing the crimes are regular people. The fear also comes from the fact that this wasn't a particularly ridiculous crime that happens once in a blue moon, it was an ordinary break in with violence and no motive. Acting = 9/10 Jumps and scares = 10/10. Many, unrelenting, shocking.",The Strangers

You should watch it alone at night, with no sound in your house at all!

The Masks are so plain, yet, somehow so scary. The ""strangers"" are mainly silent, and walk so creepily. This is the only film that has ever truly scared me.

I there would be a special category besides ""horror"" named ""boring-horror"", this movie would be a in top 10. Dialogues are rare. If the actors would have been Nobe's, this movie could have easily been in top 10 most boring movies ever made, however Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman are saving this movie from being a total disaster. If this is suppose to be a psychological analysis of either characters (not !), background and reasons (not !), ambient (not !) or the new approach in movie making (maybe) .... it failed completely.

362,ajh193,Good Movie,6,18 January 2009,"I thought this movie was actually really good. The beginning starts of very creepy and catches the viewer's attention right away. The story and conflict between the couple was pretty good; although after the movie ""Vacancy"" I thought the turmoil was somewhat redundant. There are definitely ""jump"" moments in the movie and very eerie scenes as well. The movie wasn't as slow as everyone depicts it to be. The suspense built up as the movie went on. In addition, the ending was not as cliché as people have said. I actually thought it was the perfect way to end the movie. Nevertheless, there were a few things in the movie that should have been fixed. The music being played on the house wasn't scary (as it was intended to be). In fact, it was only irritating and took away from the intensity of the scenes. Moreover, there were certain aspects of the movie that made me think, ""Why did he/she just do that?"" however, that's in every horror movie. I will agree that it was anti-climactic. Ironically, that's what I liked about it. A good portion of the horror movies I've watched consists of climactic ""chase"" scenes. At some point in those movies, a girl trips and hurts her ankle but manages to get away. This movie was different, which is what I liked about it. The climax was very different and peculiar. It was creative and scarier than many of the horror movies that have been released over the past five years.",The Strangers
363,savagebiteme,Very Scary,7,20 September 2013,I always have to put a disclaimer in front of a review because there is always some joker out there who likes to argue taste which I find annoying. For me what makes this movie work is the disclaimer that it is based on real events. Not sure if this is true but it certainly manipulates the viewer for sure.You actually can feel this movie as your watching it.It works so well because it contains real scares. It isn't as violent as many of the films coming out at the time. I remember trying to think of ways that i would try to get out of their predicament.Honestly I would be paralyzed with fear. Don't watch it alone.,The Strangers
364,theblabla245,AMAZING!!!,9,25 March 2018,"This movie is astonishing. There is this constant creepy mood throughout the show that keeps you on your toes of what will happen next. This movie completely leaves the whole ""pop-out scares"" to get you freaked out and rather preys on you by using multiple tiny little details that make your hair stand up. This constant use of paranoia is what makes the movie a classic. The characters are somewhat likeable. You will likely end up cheering for them but you won't have strong feelings when you see them suffer because the movie doesn't spend a whole whack of time developing them before the killers come into the picture. Just enough to make you feel a minor connection.What this horror movie does well is build up the tension. In most movies, we see the tension get built up for about twenty minutes then you have a big scare which releases the tension. Then builds it back up and so on. The Strangers doesn't give you that break. It continues to build up and up and up and you get more freaked out and paranoid, anticipating the end. It works in such a beautiful way that you don't feel ripped off when you don't see any actual killing.Now I know it is against the rules but I feel obligated to stand up for this film since I see it is getting unfair critique. Many people are giving it dangerously low ratings because the characters did not behave logically in certain situations...People mess up on everyday things. I'm sure if you throw in three killers in a stressful situation, they aren't thinking about every detail but rather acting on pure adrenaline. people gave this a rating of 1 star because the guy took off his jacket which had the bullets in it...I mean, I forget my car keys half the time and that is on a good day and without mass murderers trying to stab me with pointy objects so I don't think giving this low ratings because the characters made some poor decision justifies the entirety of this film. If you are looking for blood, guts, people dying left and right, this is not the film for you.

I've never seen a movie that looked this real. This will be the best horror movie for 2008 and possibly better than some of the most popular horror movies like Halloween, Nightmare on Elm Street, and The Shining. It has terrific acting that draws you into the story. I found practically no mistake in this movie, and also in my opinion one of Liv Tyler's strongest and most realistic performances. I loved this movie, it is realistic, scary, and not gory at all. For a final rating I give The Strangers 10/10.

The strangers is a practical joke.",5,11 July 2008,"I must not take someone else's credit that was Richard Roeper's line for the At the movies show. I couldn't agree more. In case you didn't know The strangers is about a couple that just came home from a wedding reception but then all the sudden three masked strangers are trying to kill them.Mind you this is Bryan Bertino's first film. I admit the film was well-done. But this is a joke. There is no scares or no thrills. When The strangers come they do absolutely nothing. They just stand in one place and they chase you. But they never take any action. It's really stupid. If that's not stupid what's more stupid than leaving your girlfriend in the house standing in the woods where a stranger could just pop up. And the second worst thing if you have a knife just don't leave it around the house. Use it. I remind you these aren't spoilers. By the way before we get this 'horror' we get 30 minutes of meeting the characters.Meeting the characters is boring. All they do is talk about how much they just 'love' each other. And then there's some kissing moments. Seriously don't spend a perfectly wasted half hour on just a couple. It's ridiculous why films do this. Once the strangers come your completely comfortable, the mood is quite, and this is a piece of junk.I loved 'Funny games' because when the psychopaths came they actually did something. What was more scary is that they acted nice but got intense. I also enjoyed 'Vacancy' because the characters weren't stupid and they actually did something while killers were trying to kill them. The problem with 'The strangers' is that the characters or killers they don't do a single thing. Well I gave the film a 5/10 which in my book is just average because some techniques of scares were done well like a girl just standing in the kitchen washing dishes while a stranger is standing right in front of here. Also most films today use the 'gore' factor and I'm glad I didn't see a lot of that.But the ending is just awful. I wouldn't spoil anything but let's just say it's not something to cheer for. Yes the endings for both 'Funny games' and 'Vacancy' were like that but you know what both films actually had good endings within them because the film was good from start to finish. Overall if you liked 'Funny games' or 'Vacancy' which are similar to this movie you'll sadly be disappointed by 'The strangers'. It might not have that gore level were tired of and might stand out as a unique film it still isn't scary of terrifying. Despite that I think that Bryan Bertino might not be the best director but he's okay considering this is his first film.",The Strangers

371,beckwith10,"Effective at moments, otherwise crude and infantile",4,30 May 2008,"Stranger invasion is as old as the hills as a horror sub genre, and despite some effective moments in ""The Strangers,"" nothing can conceal the clanking thumbscrew mechanics that churn the plot. Indeed, much goes bump (and whack and crack ....) in the night in this flick, and though the young director certainly has a gift for effective use of sound and even gins up a compelling image or two - our masked strangers effectively startle in their initial appearance and are quite unsettling - nonetheless, down to brass tacks, the story offers little other than the agonizing plight of a young couple brutalized in a remote country home by anonymous, faceless strangers, and that sure ain't news. Sure, the film delivers a few good scares, but the basic impulse behind the storyline is infantile, if not strictly by-the-numbers frights. What the director lacked was a compelling concept that examined the mystique of anonymous violence. Instead of opening it up and thinking it through, the director merely exploits it using the standard tropes of the form. But no amount of clever imagery can conceal the hollow thud inside. The problem with this film is typical of the problems with many of the standard-issue horror films these days: Directors do not seem capable of any original thinking that re-invents the genre. They can only make slicker remakes of what they - and we - have seen before.",The Strangers

381,joymontgomery-04744,Light on Scares,5,16 September 2019,"After seeing the trailer for The Strangers, I was incredibly hyped up for it. It looked like it could, potentially, be one of the scariest movies ever made. The reviews came in and many seemed to think it was pretty dang scary, so I gave it a shot and I have to ask what all the fuss was about.The Strangers is basically a two character movie with a couple spending time at their secluded home in the middle of nowhere when they get a strange knock on the door. A young woman stands at the door and asks if ""Tamara"" is home. They tell her that no one by that name lives here. Soon after, they are harassed and tormented by two other mask-wearing psychopaths who want them dead.If I can be positive for a minute, The Strangers does start off on the right ominous note. The couple, played by Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman, are likable and there's a sense of dread at first that keeps the audience on its toes, but by the midpoint, it becomes predictable. A character goes into a room, doesn't notice one of the killers is right behind them or hiding somewhere, and repeat. After the third time, this gets stale and you wonder why these people don't just go ahead and kill them. Perhaps The Strangers would have worked as a better 30 minute short, because so much of the film feels like padding.Even potentially suspenseful scenes like someone leaving their safe hiding space to go outside and try to start the car are ruined, because we never really believe either of the two leads will die until the end. We know that they'll be safe and that takes a lot of the suspense and terror away.",The Strangers

384,NightOwl0,Boring is the new scary,1,29 September 2008,"This movie starts out contrived and goes down hill from there. We see an attractive couple coming home from a social engagement. The man is sad and moody, the woman crying silently to herself. Through clumsy flashbacks we learn that the young man proposed marriage and his willowy flame said she was not ready for such a commitment. They come home, mope about for a while, almost have sex and are then terrorized by masked killers. I guess we are supposed to identify with the young couple because they are young and attractive. We have nothing else to go on because the characterization is so sketchy and lazy. Even archetypes need some sort of specificity in order to engender audience identification. The filmmaker's are proceeding from the premise that audiences don't care about character development and just want to get to the sadism. Perhaps for certain brain dead twenty somethings this will be enough. I was bored with the film from the word go. Every scene that is supposed to be suspenseful has been ripped off from another much better thriller. This film is a combination of Halloween and Scream with a little torture porn thrown in at the end for desperation's sake. The beautiful Liv Tyler is utterly wasted in a role that requires her to act like a mentally challenged five year old. A strange woman with obviously menacing intentions bangs on Tyler's door repeatedly. Instead of trying to contact the police, Tyler lights a cigarette, charges her cell phone, puts on a different outfit, calls her boyfriend on her house phone and generally behaves like a moron. It is hard to sympathize with someone who does not have one shred of a survival instinct. The killers have no motivation and stalk and kill the couple because they enjoy behaving in hateful and psychotic ways. Frankly the young couple is so useless and shallow it is hard to feel any sense of loss. The entire film is shot with hand held shaky cam techniques that the filmmaker's obviously hope will pass for a style. The only tension I felt while watching the film was a growing sense of annoyance that it was not over yet. The sense of dread and fun that is found in a masterpiece like Halloween is completely absent in this robotic-ally sadistic film. The film-making and script-writing are so lazy it is insulting. The couple is stalked and then they are killed in a brutal and obvious fashion. Somehow this process takes over an hour and a half to occur. For young audiences I suppose the payoff is the couple being killed with the stalking as some sort of foreplay. I truly do not understand the appeal of films like this. At least Friday the 13th and Nightmare on Elm Street attempted some sort of mythology. A film like this is a sad example of the limited and unimaginative fodder that passes for horror today. The only thing I really took away from this trash was a depressing feeling that what really excites people now is watching anonymous human suffering. If you are considering watching this piece of garbage I would recommend watching the artful and terrifying foreign thriller entitled ""Them.""",The Strangers

The film had a couple of respectful names to lead it yet the lack of direction dragged them down to nativity play stuff. I'm afraid that even Hostel left me thinking, ""yeah, that bit was good"", but this just left me wondering whether I could ever watch a more stupid film.It's not that the suspense wasn't developed enough its that it lead to an end about as weak as a babies grip. After seeing the first half-hour i thought that even without developing the characters, the spooky ""he's behind you!"" effect may keep me watching. Then came the reality. Cliché ridden chase scenes back and forth, like an episode of scooby doo. The death of some random guy (missed the first ten minutes of the film, maybe they might have explained his story and made me love him). And the inevitable captive situation. OK so why?

As I assure you my pain was greater.The lack of plot was original, but there's a reason it doesn't happen in movies - it doesn't work. Especially with such weak characters. And an extremely weak premise.The people in masks were a bit strange, why do we never see their faces? Rarely hear them yet they get a credit??? Then their mysterious superpowers (ie ability to appear and disappear at will) but this is contradicted by their slow slumping walks and almost complete lack of strength when it comes to stabbing the victims. It was like watching a polio sufferer trying to cut through sheet steel. Pathetic.The writer and director produced a very shoddy piece of work, lacking characters, plot, plot devices and twists.

More a haunted house movie than slasher. However, it sees the director/writing didn't have the balls to follow this up and brings on the face to face, slasher type confrontations. How much scarier would it have been if they strangers had never actually attacked, just tormented then disappeared, leaving Liv and Scott mentally damaged, if not physically. This would have played up to the idea more of it being just a game, bit of entertainment for the strangers.Also, reading some of the other comments, people say how the characters behave rationally. I can't agree with this. Liv and Scott have a shotgun and it's two against three. Not bad odds. Just go out into the field with nothing around and wait for them to approach, then...BAM!

If you are a semi-intelligent person over the age of 12 or 13,The Strangers will indeed provoke a deep emotional response from you: Anger for having wasted your time on a movie you've seen done better 100 times over. Absolute garbage.",The Strangers
391,corynye-1,Old fashioned terror flick,9,7 June 2008,"This is one of the best horror movies in recent years. It's a no-frills scary movie without any cute twists. It simply delivers constant tension, creepiness and scares from beginning to end.In a lot of ways, this movie doesn't answer a whole lot of questions when it ends, which may account for why it isn't rated higher on here. You don't know who the killers are, you don't even know why they are trying to kill the couple. ""Because you were home"" is the only motive given in the entire movie.If you like old fashioned terror, this is for you.

Zero sympathies. They deserve all they get. Normal people would remember ''If it bleeds we can kill it''.They keep splitting up which makes them even stupider than when they are together.Liv Tyler does a great impression of the stupidest farm animal you can think of. She is like a guinea pig with duck lips. Have I said how much I want to see her ''suffer''? She does that stupid crying face without tears. How does anyone cry without tears? Really starting to hate her. They drive a volvo.How does anyone with half a brain pick a Swedish car with scarce, expensive parts and over expensive repairs. Why arent they driving a Saab or maybe a Renault ?? People who put these movies together need to stop using the stupidest bit of dialogue in ''horror'' movies, hello?? JUST STOP with the hello.It is in every one and is way past dead.It is as overused as nazi.The strangers are the sort of people who would torture blind new born kittens,cus you know they are bad in a ''fun'' sort of way.Thought the 2 idiots were done but Liv does that FATAL ATTRACTION bit and springs back to life at the end ,minus the water and bathtub.No suspense,no scares, just 2 people who could be guests on 'BORN THIS WAY'.It was a struggle to watch it to the end.Every tired overused trope is in this.",The Strangers
393,sheshetta,"No Spoiler for ""The Strangers""",2,10 June 2009,"I am not going to write a spoiler for ""The Strangers"", because so many people have already told you the entire story that it would be pointless. However, I do have a point to make. The idea that this movie was inspired by real events is really a meaningless proposition, because all kinds of gruesome events happen, every day. My point is that, if you want to see a good film in this genre, you should see the American remake of ""Funny Games"". It is intellectual and witty and far more frightening. I don't even think that ""Vacancy"" measures up, although many have mentioned that film in this forum. Without writing a spoiler, I will say that the only reason I give it a 2, is the scene when Scott Speedman shoots someone. That was an authentically surprising moment; probably the only moment in the film that really works. Otherwise, I recommend that you watch ""Funny Games"", and see what happens when a good director, writer, actors, story, cinematography, and editing come together to make a great film.",The Strangers

The film really refreshes audience members with no cheap jump scares and characters making decisions for the plot, it all make sense! Plus, this film is Inspired by true events, it just always feels more real to me as a film that is inspired by a real thing. The three strangers are really refreshing killers as well as they are totally unlikeable! You don't root for these killers like you do Freddy Krueger etc, you hate them and really root for the characters for a change. The characters also feel very real as the couple who this film centres around are not on the best terms in this movie, they still care about each other and it feels real.

396,sorrow,Excellent Chiller that is both Suspenseful and Disturbing,10,30 May 2008,"I'm a horror film fan who likes his horror films full of suspense, and I especially relish those rare gems like the original _Texas Chainsaw Massacre_ and the recent _The Descent_ that leave you with a lingering disturbed feeling from the psychological aspects of the film's overall tone. For me that's the purpose of a real horror film and this film delivers the goods. _The Strangers_ is an amazing first film from its writer and director Bryan Bertino who directs his excellent lead actors from a well-paced bit of introductory drama and then proceeds to effortlessly ramp up the dread and suspense to peak levels before taking the audience on a twisted ride. The acting in this film is top-notch and the characters are believable in their actions never descending into horror cliché actions that beg for some heckler to attack. Go see this film for a good scare, but those who don't savor being disturbed should stay at home.",The Strangers
397,Deschenes,I Could Have Made This Movie,2,31 May 2008,"This movie sucked. It was about one hour long and probably took as much time to film it. The whole movie was people hiding from some people in masks. I sat in the theater waiting for a face to appear and an obnoxious shriek from Liz Tyler. (It was probably her daddy screaming though.) Finally, after many stupid moments and the ending came. The killers were stupid enough to take off their 50 cent masks from iparty and kill the people who they could have killed at the start of the movie. Plus this movie had no talking. The best line was ""Why are you doing this to us?"" In conclusion, my dog could have been a better actor than Liz Tyler.",The Strangers
398,fnj2002,Most. Annoying. Movie. Ever.,1,3 May 2009,"An unspeakably stupid and helpless young couple are engaged by three attackers who have no firearms (or motivation). The couple is armed with an excellent close defense firearm and a large quantity of ammunition, yet makes every lame mistake possible. At the end, an utterly pointless shock scene. This movie is boring and unutterably annoying because of the endless train of mind numbing blunders that would be unbelievable script even if the couple were both supposed to be pathologically retarded, which they are ostensibly not.All horror films contain blunders; it's part of the genre. But the ones that work at least make the blunders seem like tragic errors that conceivably would be made by real people, and by not taking themselves seriously. ""Strangers"" does not even come close to making us believe that any of the blunders are realistic and excusable, and poses as some kind of deep comment on decayed civilization.The first few minutes seem promising. Do not be deceived. It is a crime that Ms. Tyler's talent is wasted in this abomination.",The Strangers
399,The_Film_Addict,"Those looking for a terror-filled time at the movies will enjoy what ""The Strangers"" has to offer.",7,4 January 2009,"With an overpopulated influx of Japanese remakes and teen-targeted horror films, Bryan Bettino's ""The Strangers"" is a satisfying, mature addition into the horror genre. Although I can't say I truly enjoyed this nihilistic, torture-porn fest, those looking for a terror-filled time at the movies will enjoy what ""The Strangers"" has to offer. It's a sleazy, gut wrenching experience that effectively accomplishes what it sets out to do.After a rejected proposal, James (Scott Speedman) and Kristen (Liv Tyler) must uncomfortably share an isolated cabin in the woods. Attempting to console one another, a stranger ominously knocks at 4 o'clock in the morning. Bewildered by the encounter, the simple knocks on the door escalate to a night of sheer terror. Now, victims to their game, James and Kristen must fight for their survival from the trio of sadistic strangers.I love horror films; there's a comfortable feeling of being able to sit safely while watching people run for their lives from psychotic killers with a lust for blood. They're fake, terrifying, and entertaining. ""The Strangers,"" however, is part of movement in horror films today: realism. Once the film enters its second act, it stops being fun and starts to feel a little too real. I wanted to ask the projectionist to play the fun, slapstick version, not the one that makes me want to stick my head in the oven. I guess what I'm trying to say is thatit really is terrifying.If there is anything to be learned from ""The Strangers"" it's that Director Bryan Bertino showcases immense craftsmanship for film-making. Though the plot isn't original, it's a film that operates strictly on suspense. Forget about blood splattering murders, high body counts, and ineffective scares, Bertino's magic is all in the suspense. The film's timing is impeccable; it slowly creeps up on you until the climactic finale. The film's cinematography helps establish a claustrophobic, paranoid-induced environment, leaving viewers feeling like they're there.With a script that doesn't demand much dialogue, actors Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman effectively perform what the film demands, acting scared. Hidden behind their mask are actors Laura Margolis, Kip Weeks, and Gemma Ward, who undertake a pure physical performance mimicking the likings of Michael Meyers and Jason Voorhees. Their threatening presence is entirely felt.According to the film, ""The Strangers"" is based on actual accounts. Whatever the case may be, it's a film that effectively accomplishes its main objective flawlessly. After the film, I thought to myself: I don't even want to imagine myself in that situation.",The Strangers
400,marko-2213,One of the best true horror movies ever made.,10,1 May 2014,"A couple is returning home from a wedding. It is quickly noticeable that they aren't at the best of terms. A while later the couple starts getting terrorized by unknown assailants. The director does a great job at making us feel the impression of being isolated and how exactly powerless anyone would truly be in that type of a situation. Perhaps, the most creepy thing about this movie is that - this could happen to anyone, anywhere and at any time. The assailants are merciless and they are in complete control. Throughout the entire movie I felt chills going down my spine. From scenes with mellow jump scares - which are awesome btw (like you can see something coming but it doesn't get that scary until it's close enough) - like a couple scenes in the trailer. I think that jump scares aka Paranormal Activity and I could go on, aren't as good for horror movies as the simple feeling of true helplessness is - and this is what the director of this movie provides us with. The acting by the couple is great - big fan of Liv Tyler :), their characters are also likable which makes the movie even more horror- esque.I recommend the movie to any avid horror fan but would also mention that this type of horror greatly resembles a dark thriller so even if you don't like horror - you might start after watching this masterpiece.",The Strangers

I mean, with such a bland premise how could it have been entertaining in the least bit? But in need of a good laugh (and remembering how much fun bashing Prom Night was) I bought a ticket and subjected myself to this film. It was everything I expected and more. The ""terror"" or ""suspense"" in the film was predictable and downright lame. I mean, this film used every gimmick in the book. Whenever they're behind someone, the someone turns around and poof, like magic, the serial killer disappears. In a vain attempt to build suspense the film makers overused heavy ambiance and sudden loud music stings to make the audience jump and cringe. Too bad I found it difficult to even pay attention because of how slow it moved. Still, my friend with me and I found it most difficult to contain our laughter throughout the film at just how bad it was. Maybe if the film hadn't taken itself so seriously or tried something original, then it could have been at least half-way decent. Shame really.",The Strangers

That being said, I can't understand how anyone would willingly go into this movie knowing what it's about and leave disappointed. It delivers on every level it sought to deliver on. Reviews I've read, both good and bad, are downright bizarre. The good ones talk about how it's refreshingly about terror rather than horror, as if this is somehow unique. And the bad reviews are just nonsense (Ebert actually condemned the story!?!). Hey, if you like scary movies that keep you entertained for 90 minutes than watch this. If you like to be overcritical about movies, than you can still watch this and be overcritical about. It's real simple - two people are terrorized by masked assailants in a secluded house in the woods. That's the whole story, no more is needed, it's just mayhem and terror.",The Strangers

Luckily while I was watching this almost 2 hour movie I was with people to laugh at it with while easily scared folks in the room. Anyways the movie will do some justice for the newcomers to horror but honestly does not do much for the classic and open fans who know how to take a jump. The suspense was worked well and definitely should be seen only for theaters, a home movie release will kill any of that suspense unless you have some major screen to watch it on with high definition sound. I will give you some bad news about the movie that may hinder you afterward, the ending is not spectacular and comes before you know it, leaving you wondering where the rest of it is.

410,joshmcbridelives,Sickly Disturbing,9,27 December 2014,"I would always say I was desensitized to horror movie violence. I had seen so much of it, and been into making my own horror movies, I accepted how fake it was. I thought. NEVER WATCH THE STRANGERS. It is not SCARY or FUN or THRILLING. It is a very disturbing movie about no more than a man and woman who are terrorized in their home by masked killers throughout the movie, then tied up, and stabbed to death. The killers are strangers. It never shows their faces, the victims or the audience never know who they are. Despite the lack of a good story, or a twist ending; the creators of the movie succeeded in one thing- disturbing the viewer. The innocent Liv Tyler plays a sad song on a record player about 20-30 minutes into the movie that comes across as the most creepiest song to be played in a horror movie.(Joanna Newsom's ""Sprout and the Bean."") It's a song that seems as though it would be romantic if this were a romance movie, but it sends an upset feeling in your stomach, for you know the characters are going to be killed, since the movie starts out with a flash-forward of the crime scene. The song haunts my mind. This, and the acting made the movie very realistic to me. It became so realistic in the back of my head, that I realized I was not ""desensitized"" to this particular feeling. Many reviews that I have found on this movie, people are saying the same thing. THE SONG IS FRIGGEN CREEPY. WHERE DID IT COME FROM? This movie is good in the fact that it is the most realistic horror movie I have seen. But now that my young 14 year old sister is starting to get into horror movies, I am begging her not to watch this one, it is sick. There is no twist. There is no thrill. The movie makers just do a very good job of creating an extremely realistic murder scenario. Too real. Very, very disturbing. I do not recommend it to anyone who does not want bad thoughts in their mind. And I barely recommend it to horror movie lovers. This is the movie that will make you say, ""why do I watch these terrible things?"" I give 7 out of 10 stars because the movie is well made, and I believe they were trying to make an extremely realistic murder movie. They succeeded. So I will not give the movie a low rating. I will only warn you all to just let this one go, you don't need to see it. Made well, too well, too realistic for a horror movie. To close to our real world. Being a horror movie lover (I LOVE HOSTEL), this is the movie that makes me just want to watch something funny. The feeling it gives you is just sick. (Hostel is 20 times more visually disgusting, yet 20 times more fake.) This movie brings murder alive, in a much more realistic way. It will not just make you scared of being home alone at night, but make you scared of the world. You will feel upset. You will feel shook up. You will not feel thrilled and excited like you had just finished watching your favorite slasher movie. REMEMBER I am a BIG horror movie fan.

411,hannahclac,Is Tamera Home?,7,24 January 2020,"Warning: major spoilers.I saw this movie when it was released in theaters in 2008 and it instantly became one of my favorite horror movies. Nearly twelve years later and it's still one of my favorites. It has a slow build up, but it's worth the suspense that follows. I like the eerie music and the creepy atmosphere. I love the creepy lines such as ""Is Tamera home?"". ""See you later"", and my favorite of all ""Because you were home."" One of my favorite scenes is when The Man in the Mask appears in the background unbeknownst to Kristen. I remember thinking how terrifying that was the first time I saw it.Despite my love for this movie, I see why people don't like it. The main characters make some incredibly dumb decisions. Kristen (Liv Tyler) is home alone when her boyfriend James (Scott Speedman) goes out to buy cigarettes, and she hears repetitive banging on the door. She hears the voice of Dollface, one of the Strangers, who had previously knocked on the door to ask for Tamera. Instead of calling 911, she calls James and that's when the Strangers cut the phone line. Kristen finds that her cellphone is missing and the smoke alarm that she placed on the floor is now sitting on a chair. The Strangers continue banging on the door, and she sees The Man in the Mask through the window and then sees Dollface standing outside the front door. When James returns, Kristen tells him that she saw a man wearing a mask outside. She doesn't mention the cellphone, the smoke alarm, or that she saw also saw a girl wearing a mask standing at the front door. Eventually, she does tell him that her cellphone is missing and his response is to tell her that her phone is actually not missing, that she just misplaced it, and he doesn't believe her when she says that someone has been in the house. Why wouldn't he believe her and what kind of gaslighting BS is that? He finally believes her when he sees that the cellphone he left in his car is now inside the house. They run to the car and try to take off, but Pin-Up girl rams them with a truck. Their car is still running and they could easily escape, all they have to do is press on the gas and drive forward, but instead they run back inside the house. What kind of sense does that make? They find a shotgun which they should have been looking for to start with and they accidentally kill James's best friend Mike, which makes me upset every time I see that scene. The Strangers break Mike's windshield while he's leaving a voicemail for James. He gets out of his car, sees that James's car has been rammed and the windows are broken, then he sees that the front door is open and there is obviously something wrong. But he doesn't call 911. Instead, he walks through the house, doesn't turn off the music or announce himself, and in turn gets himself killed. James decides he's going to call for help on the radio in the barn and he tells Kristen to stay inside the house. But why? You have the shotgun and they could kill Kristen while you're gone. Why would you not want her to come with you? He just assumes that she's going to be safe inside by herself even after everything that's gone down. When he's outside, he is getting ready to shoot Pin-Up Girl but The Man in the Mask comes at home from behind. If Kristen had gone with him, she could have been the lookout for him. How did he not shoot The Man in the Mask when he came at him from behind? We hear a gunshot but apparently he missed? How ridiculous. Kristen goes after James and tries to call for help on the radio, but she trips and twists her ankle somehow? Why do people always trip and fall in horror movies? She crawls on the ground instead of hopping on one leg until she gets close to the house. When she's back inside the house, she doesn't grab a weapon before she hides. Why didn't she have a weapon on her the whole time anyway? I could continue going on and on about the dumb decisions they make. I get that horror movie characters have to make stupid decisions otherwise there wouldn't be a story. If they shot the Strangers one by one like they should have, the movie would be over shortly. Still, there has to be some sense of realism.But I still love this movie. Despite the stupid decisions the main characters make, you still care about them and feel empathetic towards them (at least I do). The entertainment, suspense, music, and creepiness of it all make it worth the watch. I like that we don't ever see the Strangers faces even when they take their masks off. I like that it doesn't rely on gore and physical torture to deliver the scares. Home invasion movies have been done a million times before, but in my opinion The Strangers is not like all other home invasion movies.",The Strangers

414,eric_mejia,THE REVIEW: The Strangers,6,29 May 2008,"LADIES AND GENTLEMEN....THE STRANGERS Is a brilliant shock-fest of slasher horror filled with chills, frights and delights all played out in what I consider an instant horror classic. Bryan Bertino's film about a young couple stalked by three complete strangers brings back the conventional film tactics from classics like ""Halloween"" and ""Friday the 13th,"" but with a modern 21st century twist of electronic horror. It's often reminiscent of last years semi-creepy film ""Vacancy"" with a bit of a ""Funny Games"" plot to it. It's a film built for it's day and age with an unexpected and somewhat dull ending. As with the trailer, The Strangers brings to life the chills with the dwelling of the unknown and what lies in the dark. It does for vacation homes with what 'Psycho' did for showers. Bertino built a smart yet very basic premise with witty action elements which will definitely drive a shriek of fright from right below your gut. Though flawed in many ways such as dialogue, predictability and character developments, you'll certainly find this picture worth a glance. ""The Strangers"" will indefinitely become one of those pictures that lends a helping hand to the reformation of the slasher genre and inspire numerous knock-offs to follow. Basically, look out for more slasher flicks to hit the screen in the next two years. The entire film plays like a psychosexual tension piece filled with somewhat frightening elements and like the original slasher flicks of the 1970's and 1980's, the lack of motive for murder. It is great to finally see a fright flick that strays away from the post 2000 craze of exploitation inspired porn-gore flicks like ""Saw"" and ""Hostel'"" and even the much horrifying in itself remake of ""Halloween,"" and brings back the rules of what frightens the inner-psyche mind, THE UNKNOWN!

416,whirling-darkness,"Waste of your time, unless you like to laugh at horror.",3,29 August 2008,"This movie was barely tolerable. Another reviewer compared it to other horror movies and called them crap in comparison. I guess he was paid to do so, or simply has no taste; This movie is one big cliché and pales next to the movies he listed.Where other movies have some inventiveness going for them, this movie has none. It's a standard, two people in a house have bad things happen to them, scenario.Not in a good way either. Not in a way that makes your skin creep or wonder what's next. I confess, the movie had me wondering at the start. It was promising. About a third to a half into the movie I realized that the promise was broken. The suspense was turning from clever into stupid.The main characters display an amazing lack of brains throughout their ordeal. Without giving away anything, I can say they act in the same way as the teenagers do in Scream. You know that list the horror-geek has? Don't do this, don't do that? Yes, in this movie they break just about every item on the list. Yawn!I cannot fault the actors- they did an okay job- it's the director's job to make sure the movie is good. You can recast actors, you can rewrite scripts, you can improvise. But he who holds responsibility for what goes on and off the cutting table is the director.I would recommend against watching this movie, unless you like to yell at the screen because the protagonists are being stupid. In my opinion, the two main leads should more closely read their next scripts before accepting them. It was a disappointing experience seeing them go through the motions of ""look at me, I'm a stupid victim"" in ordinary lack-of-ideas-horror movie fashion.There is plenty of GOOD horror out there, but most of it goes under the radar, unfortunately. With all this said, you might even like this movie. I didn't, but then again I have an aversion towards open stupidity. At least trick me into thinking I watched a smart movie. But... no. That didn't happen this time.",The Strangers

Oh my god, I love horror but I wasted a hour and half of my life watching this mess. I have to say the best part of this movie was when I had to get up and pee. I can not believe anyone would accept this as any sort of art or film making. I will sum it up right now for you; the whole movie was one very long death seen from Friday the 13th. Half way through the movie....umm no not half way 15 min. into the movie I was saying, ""Jason please come to my rescue and kill these Bi^^hes!""Sorry for everyone that enjoyed this ""movie"" but ya'll really need to get out more.

419,muse7-3,Superior Horror,6,15 August 2009,"I don't agree at all with most of the reviewers of this film. I am not really a horror fan but I find this film frightening and disturbing, which I suppose was the aim of it -and a lot better than any other horror film I have seen in recent years. Most of them are neither scary nor shocking, but just gory and silly.Liv Tyler raised this film above the average-she is a brilliant actress and has the right kind of expressive face for the genre. The perpetrators were suitably wrapped in mystery and gave a chilling aura to the whole thing. I was disappointed at the ending though, but I won't say much more! As I say I am not a horror fan really and came across this film whilst surfing the channels on TV -but the fact that it held me until the end says a lot!",The Strangers
420,Averlienb,Watch only if you love Liv Tyler and/or you're bored as hell.,3,30 November 2012,"I've watched many horror movies before, some are boring, some are creepy.This movie is creepily boring.It's started slow and vague; I have no idea what's going on with the main characters at least until minute 15.It has a few moments where viewers led to believe that some action is finally going on, but the moments will die down without anything notable. The uses of loud noises instead of some real thrilling scenes are utterly annoying.The end is just horrible. Viewers never know what's the motive of the murderers, never even shown the faces, least of all who they are and where they came from. Sure the film makers use the ""the murderers can be anyone and the killing can happen to anybody"" excuse, but then what's the point of making a movie when 80% of the storyline is left to the audience's imagination?To save everyone from having a cardiac arrest, be prepared for a loud scream from Liv Tyler at the last scene.

The whole movie consists of pointless and really badly acted scenes of by Liv Tyler. There is a goofy guy with a potato sack over his head walking around behind her, conveniently out of view when she turns around. He's accompanied by two young girls; one who talks like she's got an IQ of 60 and the other one who didn't get paid for any lines. I won't tell the ending, but I think you can gather from the cover that it did not end with them sitting around the fireplace singing Christmas Carols. A really dumb, predictable movie.

422,ye_river_xiv,"Pretty good, but...",4,31 May 2008,"""So why are you named lucky?"" ""Oh, my mother was struck by lightning when I was a child, so my dad put my weight and length on a lotto ticket and we won."" ""Really, wow! Hey, look out behind you!"" Most horror movies introduce us to the characters with crap lines like this. The strangers, thankfully, does not sink to this level. Indeed, as far as horror movies go, it's pretty good. Four hours later, I'm still wishing I could lock things up better around here. Good solid scares, and some decent work on the characters. That goes well beyond the usual Hollywood tripe.But let's not kid ourselves. It's still just a scary throwaway movie, and there are things about it that are done very poorly. Like all scary movies, it divides the world into two groups: good guys and bad guys. It also assigns to these groups a certain set of qualities. One group is for magic super lucky geniuses. The other group is for fumbling hapless morons. In this movie, the good guys happen to be the morons.Our super genius bad guys are endowed with the ability to artificially produce silence in the ears of their victims, and freeze time in order to do things extra fast without being seen. They can move a hundred feet in the time it takes someone to turn around. They can unlock doors and windows from the outside. They also are very good at destroying phones, and have no fear of firearms.Our fumbling good guys are cursed with cell phones that cannot hold a charge for more than 15 minutes, cell phones which cannot be turned on while charging, land lines which cut out for no apparent reason radios that do not work. They cannot lock or unlock doors or windows, and they suffer from an inability to shoot anything but their best friend.So yeah, maybe I would be thinking like a moron if it happened to me, but they make all the cliché horror movie mistakes. There's someone pounding on the door with an axe. Oh, I'd better forget my phone. My girlfriend's in trouble in a scary cabin in the woods. Oh, I'd better park a mile away and leave my phone in the car. Someone just shot a hole through my window, and my best friend's car is totalled. Oh, I'd better park two miles away, and go into the cabin with a stick to silently investigate without ever turning around. Someone's chasing me. Oh, I'd better trip and sprain my ankle. Good, I'm in the barn, I'd better leave the door unlocked in case I want to get out fast. Excuse me, but most people have seen enough horror movies to make a whole different set of mistakes.So maybe the bad guys are criminal master minds who do this sort of thing all the time, and have been scoping this place out for a long time. Maybe so, but if that's the case, they would know that they could trash the radio, and steal the gun ahead of time, because these people aren't going to look for them until they're in trouble anyway. Even supposing they are criminal masterminds who don't fear guns, and know just the right moment to smash radios... Eh yeah, so it's just a movie.",The Strangers
423,Vim-Fuego,A tad slow,5,9 August 2021,The only good thing about this movie is Liv Tyler. I was expecting the slow start to be building up to some tension or climax which never really happened. The end was strange and not worth the wait. Not what i was expecting having read some decent reviews.,The Strangers
424,Daggerborn,What brutal events?,4,11 July 2008,"This review contains minor spoilers, nothing that will crush the movie for you.The Strangers is what I'd call one of the bigger disappointments of recent memory for me. While it is a scary film it's most definitely not great. I'm a man with a theory and that theory is that a film is only as good as its ending. A poor ending can completely ruin a movie even if what happened previous to it was above average. It can leave the viewer feeling ripped off and like they've wasted their time. This is the case with ""The Strangers"".The opening monologue from the narrator would have you believe that you are about to watch as brutal a movie as you've ever seen. In fact he even takes the time to mention that ""The brutal events that took place there are still not entirely known."". I would like to know exactly where the brutality is. There is barely any violence in this movie. While that's fine the opening kind of sets you up for a letdown.It's a solid thriller but nothing ever really happens. There are lots of jumps and of course the occasional fake scare as we're used to in today's modern horror films but brutality there is not. Take this scenario into consideration: Protagonist walks down a long dark hall way with the camera facing his back. As he comes to a stop the camera suddenly switches to a view of his face as his ponders his next move. As we're waiting an antagonist slowly creeps towards the protagonist with a weapon in his hand. The protagonist turns around and nothing is there.Now if you find that scary I would see why but nonetheless it's a fake scare and sadly that example mirrors every thing that happens in ""The Strangers"". It happens over and over and over again. And then we're left with the ending. The poor sad excuse for an ending. I won't spoil it for you but I will say that it's realistic and that's part of the problem. I understand the movie is based on real events but let's look at that word ""based"".Did the film makers have any idea what that means? Well I guess not because they went for the ultra real approach. Think about what would happen if you were awaken suddenly in the night by 3 strangers and you have your outcome. The problem with all this is that when I see a movie I realize that I'm watching one. There has to be a plot that drives you to ask ""What happens next?"". We all realize we're watching a movie and it's for entertainment and the ending certainly doesn't do any thing to entertain the moviegoer.Let's take a look at the antagonists of the film, what have we got to work with? Three strangers (hey look at that) wearing spooky masks. We get nothing more than this, no back story, no reasoning, they just do what they do. Sounds pretty cool right? Well it's really not. The real drive behind any good movie is that the antagonists are motivated by something. You know, revenge or something like that? Well not these guys, nope they are here because they felt like it. Seriously, we never get any more elaboration than that.I was impressed by Liv Tyler's performance as it showed the range and depth of emotion she can add to a character. It's just too bad she chose this movie to show it in. Cinematography is alright but not phenomenal. A good use of browns and earthly tones when there is any color but overall a very hard film to watch because of how dark it is. You can't really fault it for that, though it can be uncharacteristically dark even for a horror movie. The Strangers can be commended for trying to stand out as it sets us up with characters we like at first.Both are in a dire situation that only adds to the tension they are faced with later. At one point we're treated to a back story that elaborates on things. Again none of this does any thing to alleviate the inevitable let down that happens later. After about 45 minutes of watching the characters make what are decidedly some of the dumber decisions I've ever seen people in general make I would say you may end up disliking them and want them to die.Overall I'd say ""The Strangers"" is solid entertainment for about 45 minutes to an hour depending on how much repetition you can take.",The Strangers
425,Fleeeks,The Strangers Video Game! (a.k.a How stupid can stupid be?) - (Spoilers),4,12 October 2008,"You play either a bad guy or Liv Retard, a mentally challenged person/victim. Liv Retard is attacked randomly by three very creepy people in masks. But fear not, they're mentally challenged too! The point of this game is to find out who needs more help.Scoring system: When sh1t starts to happen the scoring system gets activated, gain points by: Calling your unarmed, wussy boyfriend instead of 911, keep talking about random stuff till the bad guys cut your phone line If you're a bad guy bang randomly on your victim's door at 4AM and scare the living daylights out of them before you think of disabling their phones. Yes, they may have a cellphone which isn't charged (you don't know that) but what you do know is that your victim has the intelligence of a barnyard pig, that evens things out.Back to the victim: Start mumbling ""This isn't happening, this isn't happening"" to try and make it all stop. Alternatively scream ""Go Away!"" because the attackers are equally stupid and just might take you up on your offer.When your main door mysteriously creaks open go straight to it but don't shut it immediately, wait for the bad person to peekaboo you in a mask. Now that you've scored shut the door! While running around the house randomly try to knock everything down, silence is not a virtue, make as much noise as possible. Randomly fidget with household devices and break them for bonus points. Lamps need to be smashed, not switched off - every idiot knows that.(Bad guy) Now that the victims know it's life or death and have got themselves a shotgun, roam around aimlessly in well lit areas of their property. Because, every victim needs a second chance.(Good guy) If you discover your car's been completely smashed up and broken into go sit in it. When someone taps your shoulder look everywhere but in the back seat. Yes, you have the butcher's knife in your hand but that's strictly for kitchen use, not for attacking bad people who break into your house and tap you randomly.(Liv Retard) Sneak up behind your scared sh1tless boyfriend and whack his shoulders hard to show him you've missed him.(Liv Retard) Don't wait for the bad guys to hurt you, self-help is the best help. If running into furniture isn't enough make sure you hold a knife by the blade and squeeze! (Good guy) When all else fails and you suspect a horrible death awaits you in your house take off your tie and slowly dress the one inch cut on your girlfriend's palm that isn't bleeding. Philosophize about why sh1tty things are happening to you. Do all this in slow-motion, because remember folks, the point of the game is to be stupid! When a bad guy in a Ford truck is about to tail end you, stare at him for a good 30 seconds before getting distracted by a guy in a mask 20 meters away from you. Driving off or getting out of the car on time gets you a penalty.If you have a shotgun in your hands and the bad guy is chopping up your door with an axe (the door has been breached multiple times but that's not the point, the dude has an AXE!) - ignore shotgun, block door with grand piano.(Bad guys) Painting nonsensical messages in lipstick all over the vic's house or playing his country records gets a few points.(Good guy) After you accidentally shoot your best friend don't bother to reload, instead start banging the walls and crying coz maybe the guy in your house with an axe will think twice about messing with you then. Roam around your house a good few minutes before reloading. Reloading is a bad thing and attracts severe penalties! (Liv Retard) When you do get to a radio don't say your name and address - say ""Helllllpppppppppppppppppp meeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee"" instead in an ominous voice, draw out both words as long as possible for maximum points.Take a final parting shot at stupidity when you're lying on the floor stabbed multiple times, scare the hell out of your son by screaming in his face! (Bad guy) When Liv Retard asks you ""Why are you doing this?"" don't say anything menacing, instead answer, ""Because you're stupid!""",The Strangers
426,bivmanfor20,Expected a lot more,5,31 May 2008,"I wish my experience watching this movie was better. I saw it on opening night with about fifty 16 and 17 year old girls. Every time they showed one of the killers everyone screamed. Don't get me wrong its cool when the entire audience is into the movie but it got old quick. The movie itself was in my opinion just OK. It was mainly just a moviethat made you jump. I was kind of expecting a lot more from it. The beginning was cool because there was an actual plot. About 30 minutes into it the plot fell apart and it turned into be a teen fright flick. They didn't get into why the killers did what they did other than the fact that the victims ""were home"". The ending was just OK but I expected that since the beginning of the movie states ""what happened that night is still not entirely known"". Also it says it is based on a true story which it is not. Overall though with the obvious flaws aside, it was entertaining and and cool Horror movie. I am hoping for a sequel that might explain a little more of the killers M.O..",The Strangers
427,hb-boyd,Not inspiring - Lame!,2,10 January 2010,"I thought this film was based on a true story, however, the director was inspired by the Manson murders and the events here are only a work of pure fiction. And it's this fact which makes the film a flop because it's dependent on the audience buying into the illusion it's something it's not. Strip away the whole tale we're spun at the beginning about this young couple and the film falls flat - all you've got is another empty, senseless horror film. If this had been a true event it would've carried far more weight and actually been believable and bone chilling scary. The two leads are attractive and competent in their roles (Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman) but the masked killers come off as lazy and brain dead cartoon characters - not convincing murderers. Also the relationship between Liv and Tyler isn't properly addressed, no explanation is given for anything. The couple never gets to resolve their issues before the killers enter the picture but by the end of the film we're led to believe things magically worked themselves out - wtf. In conclusion, this film is a lame excuse for entertainment. If you've seen one slasher flick you've seen this already and the killers are more boring than anything. Do we need any more ridiculous horror flicks that serve no purpose other then to remind us there are still evil, sick folks out there in the world? The Strangers wasn't moving since it lacked any real storyline. Wasn't funny since it was devoid of any humor and to top it off wasn't even scary. Thank God Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman serve as great eye candy because this dud is liable to put you to sleep. YAWN!",The Strangers

From the movies disturbing opening to the bone chilling final scene, The Strangers delivers the scares and the suspense that you have been waiting for all these years. It is quite possibly the best suspense horror film ever made. One specific thing that stood out was Liv Tyler's spine tingling performance as Kristen McKay; her performance was phenomenal, each and every gut-wrenching scream made me feel the terror of the characters.

429,cajete,A Horror Of A Movie,1,2 August 2009,"This was the most god awful horror/suspense title I've ever seen. Through-out the entire movie, it was literally just banging at the doors. Yes, a little flash of the killers wearing the masks every now and then, but seriously... nothing close to scary. This should have a genre of its own. This movie just goes to show you how crappy screen plays make it mainstream as long as you have some decent actors. The plot was so mundane. There was just no climax. As well as the fact that most of the movie takes place in the house. But hey, if you enjoy watching someone cry and scream in a single spot, same camera angles, same scenery for an hour and a half straight then watch it. Don't get me started on the ending. It made no sense what so ever. After the movie was done, I could hear people getting up and complaining. I wanted a refund. I don't know what else to say about this poorly made movie.",The Strangers

People mention yuppies but have you seen Ils? Now that couple were annoying! I'm a fan of good old fashioned suspense and using atmosphere to build up fear. This does the job very well! Its a must watch and quite an achievement for Hollywood to make a slower paced scary film. Really good looking immersing film! Just lay back and watch it on the big screen. It will blow you away!

431,AngelDel,"Not very surprisingly, just disappointing.",4,14 May 2010,"Another dull ""horror"" film built with easy scary scenes and with nothing else behind to back up the sensationalistic series of events.But rather than being utterly unnecessary, the actual problem is realising that no one even tried to create anything minimally original or even worth of the genre at any point.As usual, it is the poor audience, lured into the cinema with attractive, promising posters and expectation-creating commercial slogans, who suffers the ultimate disappointment.On the plus side, the protagonist couple (Scott Speedman and Liv Tyler) is really good-looking, and their mere sight will delight the audience greatly. Which must be rewarding for the producers, since, given the rest of this unidimensional product, this seems to be the one aspect they were concerned about.",The Strangers
432,Brookic0,I thought it was a great movie...Breath of fresh air in the horror genre!,9,6 June 2008,"Before I had seen this movie, I had read the leaked script. The script was a tad different from the movie and personally I thought the rough draft script was better than the movie. There were small things they left out, that I think made the movie. In the script the killers were just as cruel and maniacal, but the script gave them a little more back story. While too much backstory is bad, the script allowed just enough to draw you in. In the script version the killers talk more giving you a realization of how crazy they are. However, there are parts of the script version that I think were left out for the better, for instance toward the end the killers take off their masks and we can see their faces. I think it was smartly played in the movie that they didn't show their faces. I like the fact that it ended with Liv Tyler character waking up gasping at the end giving her a small chance to live. Personally, I think they rushed the movie too much leaving out more of the script than the should have. The script took time to really tell a story. I think it would of been better for them to of made the movie a little longer and really told the story. I think a lot of the left out parts was them trying to leave it open for a sequel or maybe even a prequel. I really enjoyed this movie, it was a much needed break from all the horror remakes, whether it be American, Asian, or some other country, which have plagued Hollywood for the past 10 years give or take. This movie got back to basic horror at it's best, without relying so much on gore with no story, or a story & scenery with no gore, to get them by. I can't believe some people are giving this such poor reviews. In my opinion this is a fresh take on the home invasion front. The added love gone wrong, cultish killers in masks, and an actual story being told through out the movie. I hope this movie does well enough that they give us a sequel/prequel to help add a little backstory to the killers. Out of the whole cast, I found the killers the most interesting. I liked the main characters, but found myself only feeling sorry for James's character. He seemed like an awesome guy and she seemed to be in love with him, but she turned down his proposal. I think I needed more backstory on them to feel more empathy for them. I would of gave it 10 out of 10 had it not been for me reading the script first and then seeing the movie. I just can not figure out why they changed the movie ending and didn't stick with how it was wrote in the script. All in all, an excellent movie!",The Strangers
433,amandanredhead,So over rated,3,22 September 2021,"So for all the hype I expected more then this. I watched to second one first back when people used Redbox. I'll say I was so excited because the second one was very flawed and was told that it didn't compare to the first one. The second one was better.The second one was better and that is not a good thing. The first one didn't fully explain or develop the characters well, you wanted someone to be the last one but really didn't care who it was.They did all the wrong things in such a short amount of time that putting away clothes(which I was doing) was more terrifying them this movie.

434,smokes41,Underrated,8,21 August 2012,"Before I begin, I just want to say that you should only read this review if you have watched the movie otherwise it might not make sense.A lot of people seem to be saying this and I partly agree, the first half of the movie is scarier then the second because it does become a bit predictable at times, but the first half of the movie scared the hell out of me especially the scene where Liv Tyler is minding her business in the kitchen and the man in the mask appears in the shadows behind her, that scene made me really tense. I don't think there's a scene in any other horror movie that has creeped me out as much as that one, you may call the scene unrealistic because the door he came through was locked, but there are people out there who can do really sneaky things for unexplainable reasons and thats what makes them so creepy.I actually feel a kind of sorry for this movie because of how underrated it is, people are criticizing it and calling it unrealistic, unoriginal and the characters are dumb, lets talk about that, you have to understand that this is a very scary situation they are in and you wouldn't be thinking that clearly, I mean at least they actually try to deal with the situation, Scott Speedman actually comes pretty close to blasting ones head off with the shotgun.The ending to this movie would probably be my least favourite part, it is very brutal and nasty and does make you cringe a bit, but I suppose it does make it more realistic, it doesn't end with a dumb Hollywood ending like the 1993 remake of The Vanishing.I really like the line ""Because you were home"" which comes from the blonde stranger, Gemma Ward, it means that the three strangers just did it because they could, there was no reason behind it all, they were just a bunch of people who just wanted to harm other people just for the fun of it, its pretty revolting and their the kind of people you would want to stay away from. of course they did feel a bit disturbed before stabbing the couple but thats because it was there first time killing probably. It really ads realism to them, their not Michael Myers material that just kill people without conscience, these are human beings.All in all I think this is a decent horror flick and has a great build up throughout, Bryan Bertino did a great job in creating fear",The Strangers

Does she call 911? Nooooo....she calls the boyfriend asking him to come home. Then the land line goes dead. The boyfriend manages to make it home, but *gasp* leaves his cell in his car. He goes out to get the cell and *gasp* it's gone. While he's outside does he go to a neighbor's house for help? Noooo...he goes back inside.

The director just tried to hard to plaster the viewers with too much slow build up with no she-bang after. The moments of brightness disappeared as fast as it came. The slow moments became achingly irritating and the direction of the protagonist left us with some silly setups that just left me thinking how amateurish the planning had been. Sure there were some clever ideas with camera angles, montage and the use of sound (the music annoyed me though) but it didn't gel together. Watch it if you love to see Liv Tyler.

442,bitchyrita,Not one scary moment.... dull and long,1,16 March 2009,"""The strangers"" has got to be one of the most boring horror movies I ever saw. It is so slow and then when something happens, like a door knock or a sound of metal outside, you ask yourself ""is that it? That's all?"" That's not scary, that's just lame timing and lame excuse for trying to make stuff suspenseful.The movie starts out with the couple returning home, they're in a bad mood and nothing happens for something like 20 minutes, just a few predictable flashbacks. Then there's a knock on the door and it's some girl looking for ""tamara"", obviously a trick to see who is home. We saw that coming, no surprise. And then the guy goes out to get cigarettes for Liv Tyler, by the time he comes back she's already nearly had a breakdown. After that the three strangers toy with them and finally kill the couple. This is like a boring bad version of ""Funny Games"" which was at least scary and tense, even if it wasn't that great either.Final thought, this is a very boring film, badly written, and even though Liv Tyler is just almost okay, it has pretty bad acting and little to offer in scares.",The Strangers
443,latinoheat577,My favorite movie need i say more.,9,19 July 2013,My favorite if not a fan Stop here. Iam a huge fan of real footage movies this is not 1 of them but I love it .Id like the idea of being stuck in a house in the middle of no where your all along and some psycho looking strangers outside terrifying you to death you either fight or flight deal and having the right music in background really helps i think both characters were believable and the villains so cool in the way they just kept coming in and out of house not looking to kill right away. I must admit the ending was the only big question mark Because you were home. But i highly recommend it turn lights of at your home grab some popcorn and most important you need great surround sound and enjoy Did i forget to mention Lock your doors how silly of me. Well kids like always Slash you later.,The Strangers
444,Muhls,Your typical horror movie,4,24 July 2008,I looked forward to The Strangers for a long time but it disappointed me. It was a typical horror movie with jump scenes that you could predict. This movie shows that people kill just to kill. It shows that there are some deranged people in the world. The main characters in this movie were dumb like in every other horror movie. It could have been good with a few tweaks around the corners like an interesting twist in the end but it didn't have anything that would make it stick out from another horror movie. The Strangers made me jump out of my seat every now and then but it isn't a movie that i would exactly recommend you see.,The Strangers
445,Aguas,Suspenseful but flat movie,5,16 June 2008,"""The Strangers"" did an excellent job of achieving suspense; but fell far short in supplying the other ingredients that make up a successful movie. The movie did little to develop or explain any of the characters. After the exposition of the main characters dealing with isolation and assault by unknown assailants there was no crescendo. Finally, the tactics by the protagonists became unbelievable about an hour into the movie. It was upsetting that the writers failed to address these three key issues because the director did a very good job handling suspense with a minimum of special effects and blood. On the whole this movie is a B minus, and only worth watching if you can catch it for less than a couple of bucks or you want your girlfriend to grab you tight.",The Strangers

447,sherihulse,The Strangers.....,9,22 September 2008,Its kinda hard to put into words on what this movie is like....because at the same time of me feeling like this movie was a bore...it also scared the hell out of me!? Unlike most horror films that have various story lines tying into one major storyline...this is just concentrating on the two main characters and whats happening to them....so it kinda feels like the film drags on a little.....even though it only lasts 4 like 85 mins!? For the 1st 20 mins / half hour of sitting in the movie theatre watching the film I kinda felt like I wanted to get up n leave....it was soooo dull.....but then the tension and horror starts to kick in and it did truly make me physically jump in one or two places!!....as well as everyone else in the room...lol! The film does its job of giving you the eeby jeeby's!....I left felling like that could have possibly been one of the most scariest films I could have possibly have seen!!...and maybe its because its a kinda realistic film...one where this could actually happen to you!?...rather than the films out of late...the ring...one missed call...the grudge...where they're more just supernatural....where to really scare you...you'd kinda need to believe in the supernatural activities that occur in those films!? Id say for this film I got my money's worth...but I fink its maybe one of them films where wen you've seen it once...thats enough... Don't think I'll b purchasing this one on DVD..,The Strangers
448,grangers-1,Beautiful in its simplicity,7,31 August 2008,"The film begins with no horror or suspense. Just the story of an evening wherein the guy proposes to the girl and she says: ""No"".Then the menace begins to creep in. First, the couple find goings on weird. This later turns much more threatening.The main theme of the film being that this could happen to you. They are not in a house in the worlds where a family were previously butchered, or in a Deep South rural community were families breed amongst themselves and outsiders are on the menu. They are in a house on a road with little traffic at night and the neighbours are out of earshot.The film treads a fine line between life-realistic torment and being too mundane. But, its Tyler and the 'Strangers' outside her house that ensure that we are kept hooked.There are a lot of little visual details in the film that add to the sense of forthcoming possible doom whether it be a shaking camera (just at the right time), or the unloved dated look of the interior of the house.On the face of it this is a film that on paper sounds like a few dozen earlier examples of the horror/suspense genre. But, this stands out for its life mimicking simplicity, our attachment to the guy and girl and the beauty with which it is shoot.(My 13 year old daughter didn't sleep well the night after we saw it.)",The Strangers
449,piattbruner,Stranger Danger,9,27 May 2008,"I was lucky enough to catch an early screening of this over the weekend, and all I can say is WOW. This movie grabbed my attention not as quickly as I would have liked, but when it did get me, it held on tight. This movie is terrifying, maybe not in the way you would expect it to be, but this movie is just about as disturbing as it comes. While I don't see it becoming an instant classic right away, I can definitely see this as a legendary horror film in a few years. While the story wasn't exactly ""one of a kind"" (I've seen the original, and the french version ""Ils""), it is one that never stops scaring. The acting was great from the whole cast, and you could literally feel the tension and the fear. In some points I even felt my heart skip a beat or two. Personally, don't believe any of the VERY FEW poor reviews this movie has received, you will definitely be scared and shocked at this movie, and you will definitely want to sleep with the lights on....",The Strangers

Synopsis: -Couple is in a isolated home. -""Creepy"" girl knocks on the door at 4am to ask is Tamara home. Man leaves to get smokes for girl. -3 masked strangers freak out the girl. -Man returns, trio trashes car. Man gets gun. Decides to leave girl alone to get to a ham radio.

454,giftofgodoflove,"Effective beginning, failed in the 3rd act . . .",6,30 March 2009,"Spoilers!!! The 1st Act, in my opinion, is near flawless. The movie showed exactly what it wanted to show us about them. James Hoyt and Kristen McKay enter Hoyt's parents house late at night. They both look emotionally drained. I especially like the camera angles: close, a little shaky, but not too much, dark colors, and they give a glimpse just long enough to show us some important detail. The rose petals on the floor and in the bath-tub, the wine-glasses, the dinner table neatly set up, homey pictures hang from the walls, normal house decorations, a place on the wall which measured Hoyt's height: little details like this did their job wonderfully. Namely, this is a normal home, and it could be yours! The house is in the middle of nowhere, tall, stark trees dart out of the front yard, and they are almost characters in themselves. Cars pass by very seldom. We learn James proposed to Kristen, but his love is unrequited. And then the creepiness begins. The suspense is really quite excellent, and as far as my own experience is concerned (for that is all I have to work with), I was very unnerved.Observation: People who make jokes during a scary movie are usually scared themselves, period. I hate nothing more than some idiot, during some building-point in a scary movie, to start being obnoxious, saying something like, ""Ohhh I'm sooo scared."" Or they start laughing or something. READ: They are scared. And they have to ruin it for everyone else by acting macho, and lying about how the movie was stupid, or some other stupid opinion. In all my life, I'll never figure why these kinds of people just won't SHUT UP and watch the darn movie, or GO AWAY! The 1st Act culminates when James leaves to buy Kristen cigarettes. I have reservations about objecting to a movie just because the characters do stupid things, even though that is the main reason why the 2nd and 3rd acts are weak. Let's analyze what happens. That creepy girl - who asks for 'Tamera' at 2 in the morning - has already came to the door. At that point, I would think it's probably more safe if I stay with Kristen. I mean, it's pretty odd if some random girl just shows up at a house, in the middle of nowhere, w/ no transportation, and not a house for miles, to ask if some random girl lives at a house which - it just so happens - you are living in for the night, right? Well, James leaves. When he does, the spookiness almost reaches a boil! The knocking continues, you catch a glimpse of the psychos, you learn they where strange masks, that there is more than one, etc . . . The scene that makes the movie stand out is when the 'guy' is standing behind Kristen without her knowing. She's just walking around the kitchen, already tense from other things that have happened, we know he is there, she does not, we hear a noise, he disappears, she walks to where he was, he is not there, but we know he either is in the house somewhere or he is not, and he can get in whenever he wants. Admittedly, the psychos display almost superhuman agility to disappear at almost ninja speed, and that is what strikes such a discordant note with the 1st act, since the 1st act was teeming with Realism. In the other acts, the psychos almost start disobeying the laws of logic and physics.I agree with almost all the users who say that James starts acting like a complete and utter moron throughout most of the movie.Mistake #1 - Left Kristen alone AFTER creepy girl knocks on door and asks for random girl.Mistake #2 - Poor use of shot-gun.Mistake #3 - After finding the perfect bunker in the bedroom, you leave. I admit there is much trauma when you blow your best friend's heat off. I know! It's terrible. But there are 2 lives left! Get a grip on reality, stop sobbing, get a hold of yourself, go back to where your were, and wait it out 'till morning, for God's sake. At first, he starts crying in the fetal position, utterly vulnerable to a psycho if one of them was in the hallway.Mistake #4 - Because of mistake #3, he decides to leave, and go call for help on a radio in a shed that is outside where the ninjas are. Has he gone completely nuts! He says, ""I don't know what else to do."" Excuse me? Did you get an 'F' in critical thinking skills? Of course, there are other things to do. Go back to your bunker in the bedroom!! Mistake #5 - After he returns from cigarette shopping, he finds Kristen hysterical with fear. She mentions the 'Tamera girl' coming back, banging, that one of them took her cell phone, etc . . . She has a gash on her hand, a gaping wound, you know her to be somewhat rational . . . Why on God's green earth would you doubt was she is saying? Why, James, why? For God's sake, take her word for it, and prepare defensive tactics accordingly.There are some other things to note - the gratuitous Mormons, the mistakes of Kristin, the mistakes of James' friend, the particular cliché's uses, the somewhat useless interchange between the ninja-psychos and the Mormons (What exactly will be easier next time? Killing someone else, they know they'll be forgiven because w/ James and Kristen they felt a little guilty, or what?!?!?) - but I'll cut this short for want of room.",The Strangers
455,Aditya_Bhattacharyya,Pointless,1,28 October 2015,"Undoubtedly one of the worst movies ever made in the home-invasion genre. Or, is it? This movie actually demonstrates that the true horror lies in a nonsensical script full of stupid characters and their illogical behavior. A dumb couple comes under attack by a gang of dumber assailants. Both the protagonists and the antagonists do not know why they are acting in such a weird and pointless way. No explanation has been offered for their behavior. Nothing is explained at the end. Moreover, the movie has been filmed with shaky cams which makes it even more irritating to watch.

People start banging on the windows and harassing them for no reason...only to eventually kill the two main characters when the sun comes up.There is no real plot or lesson or story in this movie, we find out nothing about the characters life, or about the killers and why they decided to murder them.When the killers are asked ""Why are you doing this"" they answered ""Because you were home"".In the end of the movie we are left with no knowledge of what we have seen and are left with one feeling only and that one feeling is pure disappointment.

Nowadays, ""horror"" movies are just gorefests, but I'll admit it, I cover my eyes during these films, but only because I don't want to see eyeballs being poked out, Achilles tendons being snipped, fingers being cut off with a butter knife, bodies being sliced open; you catch my drift. If I pay to go to a scary movie, I want to be scared, not disgusted to the point of nauseousness! The Strangers does this with flying colors. The scares are abundant, but not obvious; you won't know when or how the next one will come. The three strangers are truly scary, maybe because of their masks or maybe because their faces are never revealed, adding to the tension and mystery. I had goosebumps the entire movie, probably because I couldn't wait to see what the strangers did next, but was too scared to want know, if that makes sense. Basically, The Strangers grabs on and doesn't let go until the very end, where at that point you'll probably find yourself too scared to go home alone that night; I know I was.",The Strangers

459,gusalexandrakis,Spoiler: Movie Dies Halfway Thru,2,24 July 2019,"I had hopes for this movie, as it started out great with the premise of a young couple dealing with a crossroad in their relationship: he wants to get engaged, she's not ready yet. There's a sweet mournfulness between them as they try to reconcile , that makes you think they might be successful, but just as they're about to make love, they're interrupted by someone pounding on the door of their remote house.Personally, I think most people would ignore the interruption, say ""Go Away"", or just ask thru the door, who it is, but no, these idiots open the door, to find a rather disoriented young woman asking for someone who doesn't live there. After closing the door, the mood's cooled between the lovers, so he decides to go for a drive, after making sure she has a fire to curl up by.It's at this point, things become scary, as the separated couple start to realize there's someone, or several someones, intent on harming them. Suspense builds as the house is invaded. But then...It all becomes a jumble of violence, jump scares, and the usual crap Hollywood now trots out as 'suspense'. The main characters begin consistently making the stupidest decisions possible under the circumstances, opening doors despite knowing they're under threat, running around outside, getting in a car without checking the backseat, and so forth. You begin to think maybe it's good these two didn't get married and reproduce, for they would've spawned idiots.Honestly, I, a person known to watch almost anything till the bitter end, had to give up on this one.",The Strangers

I am late to the party having never watched it before but wanted to get an idea of what it was about before seeing The Strangers: Prey at Night. I honestly couldn't get on board with the two, miserable main characters and the pace, intended to build suspense; just built boredom in me. When the killers did make their prescence known it still didn't really amount to much. The main chunk of the film I watched in 2x speed just to get it over with quickly. Everything seems to happen slowly, solid 10-20 second shots of the sad female character standing at the porch. Another 30 seconds of the downtrodden male character breathing heavily and creeping to the obviously battered car. Maybe the scenes didn't last that long but I just got so bored throughout it felt like forever. Many would have turned off I guess but I wanted to get to the end in case the sequel had any ties.When it did finally reach its dull climax I almost felt happy for the couple.

From here we don't get much plot other than what you would expect from something like this, although the events of the movie to flow quite well together.Acting and dialogue are more than acceptable, and there isn't anything so jarring that it gets in the way of the atmosphere that is created from very early on.The movie has a very distinct look throughout, and this is a big part of how memorable I found this movie.

The ending was a bit over the top for me too and rather than scaring me nearly made sick. The story plot of them having an argument although this was based on true story I found quite unbelievable they seemed so happy so why would she say no to a proposal.

471,fastfastfastradio,"Anyone, Anywhere, Anytime",8,28 June 2020,"This film is very much a mixed bag, there's a lot of great things about it and a lot of bad things about it too, however, overall I tend to see more good in it than bad. The most genuinely scary part of this movie is the concept: three masked strangers picking a random house to terrorize. The people being attacked have no clue who these attackers are or why they're being attacked, which evokes the idea that these types of random acts of violence could potentially happen to anyone, anywhere, anytime.The first half of the film is so atmospheric, suspenseful, and unsettling to that it's kind of amazing. It takes a long time building up a lot of tension before resorting to using jump scares. The scene where Liv Tyler is standing in the kitchen smoking a cigarette and in the background the Man in the Mask steps out from the shadows watching her is a genuinely creepy shot, and very much sums up what's great about the first half of the film is. That shot is honestly burned into my memory from watching this movie as a child at an age I shouldn't have seen it at, it terrified me, and lead me to have an irrational fear of masks for years. Yes, it really is that effective.After a while, though, the film begins to slip into horror cliches such as jump scares and the main characters making incredibly irrational, stupid decisions. A great example is when the protagonists have a shotgun and hole up in a closet and make the smart decision to just sit there until one of the attackers comes so they can easily shoot them, only to decide less than five minutes later to leave the closet and split up. Despite these decisions in the latter half of the film, the concept of the film is enough to overlook those poorly written moments simply because if you were in this position, totally scared for your life, you'd probably also make some impulsive, irrational decisions.Overall this movie posses an unsettling nature thru it's concept, asserted by the fact that this could realistically happen to anyone, which for the most part overshadows the negative aspects of the film.",The Strangers

The first are those that are truly ""scary"" and creepy and leave you thinking about the film afterwards for weeks. Then there are ""startling"" horror films that cause you to jump because some one shows up and yells ""boo"" when you are not expecting them to.The Strangers is a ""startling"" horror film all the way.In fact, the tension and any ""creepiness"" that may have occurred in the earlier portions of the film, quickly dissipate midway through the film leaving me bored and waiting for the next shock.Films like The Ring or Hostel are genuinely scary, The Strangers is not.Plus, it's extremely short. It claims to be 90 minutes, but I think it's more like 85 (at least the screener I saw was...) The only reason it mustered a 5 out of 10 in my books was because of the use of old country music on a record player in the background, the set design, the cameo by Glenn Howerton of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia, and the very first ""scary"" moment in the kitchen...It's not terrible, but it's certainly not good.",The Strangers

They used every cliché in the book, extremely well, mind you, but none of the ideas were original.The final few scenes were extremely disturbing and probably the most interesting part of the movie to me.So much stuff was predictable though.The ending was IDIOTIC though. Terrible, terrible, cheesy, grade-z horror ending. Seriously they could have just finished the film with the second to last scene and it would have been SO much better.Liv Tyler explained in the bonus features how she had never experienced that kind of fear before, that paralyzing, I-just-heard-a-sound-in-my-house-better-go-get-a-knife feeling, which was SHOCKING to me. She played it SO well. The movie as a whole had such a realistic nightmare-ish feel to it, as the events unfolded it was just as i would imagine it happening to me. Liv Tyler basically did everything i would of, she was so realistic.The look of the film was nice too. A beautiful 70's ranch house pallet of dulled oranges, greens, browns and reds all covered in deep shadows.All in all, i rated this movie an 8/10 with deductions for clichés and the horrible ending, but now I'm not so sure as if i might even rank it lower. It was definitely scary but not inventive or new.",The Strangers

I knew it the instant you started out with the beginning at the end... That is a red flag for ""I'm not confident in the script, or my characters, so I'll hook you in with flashes of cryptic violence."" I admit, your beauty was hypnotic... almost sublime at times, but alas, you cannot polish a turd. Your pretty face and moody imagery can only get you (or me) in the door, but you lacked follow through. You lacked confidence. You lacked compelling characters I even remotely care about. You lacked even the actual John Laroquette to do the docu-drama Texas Chainsaw Massacre voice over in the beginning. (I mean, what would it cost to get him - a hot meal?) So what did you do to fill the obvious void? You followed all of those before you: Step. By. Step. There was not ONE genuinely scary moment in your heart, only silly, shallow shockers.The sad thing is, I had such high hopes for you... for US. We could have had something really special together, there... in the dark. I can forgive so much, and I only ask for honesty in return. But you, with your obvious plot devices and 2nd rate scare tactics - you sadden me. Nay, you disgust me. My mama told me never to trust a pretty face. (And what a pretty face you had!)

476,twilighter123,Now this a Horror movie!,10,10 June 2008,"Before The Strangers came out, I watched the movie trailer so many times on youtube, and I thought that maybe that this movie would prove people that there is a movie such thing as ""Horror, or Scary"" nowadays. And in my opinion, I believe I was right. From the moment I entered the movie theater, and from the moment I exited it out, I couldn't believe what I just witnessed. The Strangers kept me thinking in the end. I thought the movie flawless, and it contained everything that I could ask for in a horror movie. But that's not so with everyone. A lot of people said that the movie was really bad and the ending sucked. I really don't think so. The movie itself, to me, was good and all, but at the same time it gave out this eerie awkwardness. What I mean is, the killers came, tortured them, and killed them giving out no explanation of why they did what they did. Later you find out that Kristen, Liv Tyler, survived the brutal attacks. But it has an awkward side to it, something dark and Gothic about it. I said that the movie was flawless, but if there was a flaw in it, it would have to be that it gave no explanation in the end. Maybe they'll come out with a squal or something. But they came, they did what they wanted to, and left. why??But like I said, I wasn't disappointed one bit. I loved it. 10 stars.",The Strangers

The film manages to create many scares during its intense atmosphere without a ton of blood and guts. The killers were far more terrifying than an invincible hockey mask wearing villain. During the now famous pulling of the drape scene they managed to make me a grown 41 year old man gasp and jump in my seat so I found that impressive. For every feeble effort like the PROM NIGHT remake and DEAD SILENCE along true gems like DESCENT or now THE STRANGERS.Yes, well done, well done...and Liv Tyler is easy on the eyes to boot.",The Strangers

After having watched Criminal Minds religiously and movies like The Collector I assumed home invasions movies couldn't scare me anymore. Well, I was wrong!Part of the reason I liked this movie so much, and why I was really affected by it, is that the main actors do a great job of developing the characters (at least for a horror movie) and as a result I felt like they were my friends. The suspense is incredible throughout the movie and I admit I screamed at more than one part. The ending was gory, but by that time I was honestly glad that their nightmare was over. This movie is the reason that I check every corner of my apartment before I go to bed at night.",The Strangers

481,Yoshi_Dino,Average,5,29 October 2014,"..so let's split the good and bad:+ Has it's scary moments and good overall Atmo. You just have to focus and put your reservations aside, otherwise watching this will be a waste of time.+ Acting was decent, and the characters somewhat likable. I wouldn't go as far as saying i rooted for those 2, but i also didn't want them to die asap..+ No stupid turn of events. You get what is promised early in the film, nothing more or less. I dislike when movies turn random.+ It's a well crafted film. This is not a cheap production.And the bad:The intro. A wedding reception that didn't work out is used to make us believe these 2 good looking people hit rock bottom. That's boring to the ""normal"" viewer, and screams spoiled Hollywood kids. Oh and it's also too long.They do stupid things. You know..like splitting up, leaving their excellent cover positions. Nonsense like ""stay in the house"" when they know they are already inside. Outstanding horror movies work around those clichés and find other ways to create suspense and move the story on.It becomes too obvious that the intruders play games with their victims. You know they will not be killed ""now"", and this removes suspense.The ending didn't satisfy me. I also never believed it's based on a true story. Like most other films claiming that, The Strangers is inspired by certain events. Which is nothing that should even be mentioned, it's a cruel world and almost everything ""really"" happened.So that's it, a watchable horror movie. No masterpiece, but a good time killer.",The Strangers

People who think horror is all about blood and guts don't appreciate anything else and will not like this movie. It's terrifying and incredibly tense. I am a HUGE horror fan and this is genuinely one of the scariest I've ever seen because it builds suspense for so long, you just wait and wait for these horrible people to come out of the shadows and strike. I was holding my boyfriend's hand with white knuckles the whole time!In short: If you are impatient or NEED instant gratification, this movie isn't for you.

483,ddobson-86777,Annoyingly terrible movie. DO NOT WATCH!,1,27 May 2016,"First and foremost, my review contains spoilers but trust me there's not much to spoil and if my review spares one person from wasting their time watching this it was worth it.The movie starts off like so many of these movies do with some young people in a remote cabin in the woods so already not very original. It can be easily inferred that the young couple in this movie are having relationship troubles due to the woman having rejected the man's marriage proposal. This might seem like it's important to the plot but it is completely irrelevant to the rest of the movie. Things start to pick up when there is a knock on the door and a shadowed woman asks if someone named ""Tamara"" is home. Soon after there is more knocking and her friends show up in stupid looking masks and start loudly banging on the house for some reason even though it has already been revealed that they can get into the house somehow. I think this was supposed to be scary but it really is just annoying. The couple finds a shotgun and the man attempts to blast one of the masked idiots in the face but somehow they miss despite being three feet away with a shotgun. They hole up in a room to wait them out and then Dennis from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia shows up. Just as I was thinking he was going to bring some levity and possibly salvage this train-wreck of a movie, he gets blasted in the face by his friend with the shotgun. What a waste of a talented actor! More annoying banging and a failed escape attempt later the couple ends up tied to chairs and killed. No exposition is given at any point in the movie as to who the people in the stupid masks are or why there are doing what they are doing. In attempt to make the movie scarier they removed the plot. There is no character development of any kind throughout the movie. I want those two hours of my life back.",The Strangers
484,sickstreetsk8er7_547,wow,9,30 May 2008,"Let me start this review by saying that I had high expectations for this movie. I guess my reasoning for those expectations was the fact that the burlap sack mask was one of few masks that actually creeped me out, the others being leatherface and of course, Jason Voorhees. Anyhow, this movie was fantastic. It was truly terrifying, which is saying something coming from me. I have never seen a movie that messed with my head as bad as this movie. Scenes where the killers are standing in the background, completely visible but behind the characters, were fantastic. There were parts where all would be silent, you'd be ready to jump, and somewhere, in one of the other rooms, one of the killers would simply start the record player, which messes with you cause you're so ready for someone to jump and scare the hell out of you. In conclusion, this is the best new horror I've seen since the remake of the Texas chainsaw massacre, the only thing keeping me from giving it a 10 is a plot hole near the beginning of the movie, that bugged me, but the absolute perfection of the rest of the movie completely outweighed it.",The Strangers
485,RichieRich1,Not good not bad either,5,24 August 2008,"This Strangers starring Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman has its good moments but unfortunately there are some bad moments to. The plot is quite basic, the actors play a couple who are alone in a deserted house and shortly 3 strangers (2 women and a huge guy) start harassing them. That's it. Liv Tyler does her best but she ain't no Neve Campbell and Scott Speedman (I'm sorry) but his acting is just plain and boring. Another thing you all out there need to keep in mind is that THE MOVIE IS ONLY 75 minutes long. It's like the director ran out of ideas and just decided to finish it at 75 minutes. The first 45 minutes are quiet slow and sometimes you really have to hit yourself to keep awake but the last 30 minutes when the strangers start showing themselves things start to get interesting. There is a nice scene with an friend of the couples who unfortunately gets himself involved in the events. The last two scenes of the movie are absolutely amazing. Their is an emotional scene between Live and Scott which is quiet moving and the ending scene reminded me of I know what you did last summer. Trust me people where screaming their heads off.So it's an average horror movie more suspenseful than scary. I would recommend the people out there rent it on DVD as this movie does not deserve the 10 euro I paid, 5 euro would have been a more suitable price.",The Strangers

I don't care that its a first time director. I did not read anything about this film or know anything about it before watching it. Apparently the trailer was good, according to my gf. I honestly thought the nasty people of this film were ghosts - i mean how did they get the time to write stupid things like ""killer"" and ""hello"" etc in lipstick? How can they not find liv tyler crawling around the yard like a retard? Why does one of the serial killers walk around breathing like darth vader? How predictable is the shotgun death of the friend? This is a film that relies on the traditional horror use of sound in combination with extreme close ups of the horrific bad guys. There are a lot of reviews on the net that do not slam this movie as they should. Please take heed of my advice and do not even bother. There is no payoff, there is no insight, there is nothing new at all in this genre log cabin serial killer POS film. It's a low budget film too. I mean mainly one location.

488,Phat Beast,"Intense, Suspenseful, Disturbing",8,1 June 2008,"By far one of the best horror movies I've seen in recent memory, The Strangers works so well because it is able to distinguish itself from most films within the genre today. What is most noticeable is the fact that the filmmakers eschew (for the most part) the ubiquitous ""gotcha"" tactics meant to deliver cheap scares, opting instead to build suspense slowly, allowing the audience's anticipation to build up, furthering the terror. Throughout the film, the viewer believes that it is a question of ""when,"" rather than ""if,"" which keeps the audience alert and on edge the entire time. Additionally, the few ""gotcha"" scenes that do appear in the movie are well done. They are simple and believable, rather than flashy, and serve to release some of the built up tension and segue smoothly into the next portion of the film.Part of what makes The Strangers so scary is that it is a very disturbing movie, simply because it is so realistic. Nothing is supernatural or extraordinary -- this is something that the viewer could picture actually happening (the film claims to be based loosely upon true events). Rather than some kind of ghost story, the movie is a look into the darkest side of human nature. The fact that the violence seems to be so senseless just adds to the horror. More impressive still, the extremely high level of effectiveness is achieved with little gore and less action. It is just frightening. I believe that it deserves reiteration that the events depicted in the movie are very disturbing, and that viewers who might be especially sensitive to such themes should probably avoid it. But for those who can handle it, The Strangers is definitely one of the best scary movies made in years, and choosing to spend an hour and a half watching it is a decision that you won't regret.",The Strangers

490,locked_in_the_attic,"A chilling, intense slap round the chops",8,17 September 2008,"I tried not to get my hopes up about this one, going with a loose rule of the quality of a modern American horror film being inversely proportional to its box office takings. Boy was I wrong to be so cynical. After the brief prologue, director Bryan Bertino draws the viewer straight into the film, presenting us with what appears to be a very unhappy couple driving up to an isolated house. Within 15 minutes we are given a girl knocking on the door at four in the morning and our heroine being left alone, and the fear which begins to take hold rarely lets up for the remainder of the film. The way the unwelcome, masked tormentors play with the couple is gleefully creepy. Genuine, sphincter-tightening suspense and effective shocks combined with a surprisingly downbeat feel are what, for me, made this one of the best mainstream scare flicks in a long time. At times the film conjures up fond memories of 70s house-invasion exploitation fare, and is also vaguely reminiscent of French shocker Ils (Them). Thankfully though, it surpasses that overrated ride of mediocrity on every level. Liv Tyler is perfectly cast, really making you feel her fear and using that knack of hers to get the audience firmly on her side. What really surprised me about The Strangers was how deeply pessimistic it feels. I'm not going to bother retelling the plot and won't give away what I thought to be a perfectly-formed climax (though it will no doubt split opinion), but the plight of the terrorised couple seems utterly hopeless throughout. I loved this in the film; It is a rare thing in mainstream fare like this and is partly what makes The Strangers so challenging and lifts it above the crowd. The film is an intense cinema experience, and leaves you feeling like you've just been slapped round the face. Hard.",The Strangers

You've seen this movie before, it just has different actors. There are no outstanding performances, just running screaming and breathing heavy while hiding. Also, it's just a bummer movie. The opening narration basically lets you know that there is no hope. It's kind of like the Texas Chainsaw Massacre prequel. Why bother sitting through a movie if you know the victims aren't going to make it? Instead of taking the opportunity to take an old formula and turn it on its ear, the filmmaker just follows it to the letter. But I don't want to end this on a bad note, despite how richly this movie deserves it. There is one interesting aspect, and that is the killers could be anybody. The filmmaker goes out of his way to never show their faces, or to make their personalities stand out. I guess it's an attempt to make the viewer feel that these murderers could live next door to them.

It contained all the unoriginal aspects that make horror movies so lame to begin with, but instead of having a group of lousy acting teenagers that you laugh at, as they all die off, you just had awkward pauses and crappy acting via Liv Tyler. The main characters have cell phones, a knife, and a shotgun and manage to get outwitted by some douche bag with an ax, and two women who are prone to throwing rocks and writing messages on windows with red paint. The minute scary crap started to happen they could have simply called 911. Instead they just did what stupid typical horror characters do which is ""nothing productive"". Meanwhile the entire movie consists of them going from the house, to the driveway, to the yard. They try to make it seem like a vast area is being traversed through all of this pointless movement, but in reality its 20 square yards.

Then this movie will scare the pants off of you!,3,3 November 2008,"Some people say that this movie succeeds at what it aims to do, and they're right; it takes the most basic horror premise, a couple trapped in a house being attacked by a couple of psychopaths with masks and knives.With a buildup so boring and uninspired, and an ending that is so predictable and embarrassing, I can only recommend this movie to people who've never seen a horror movie before, and therefore can't recognize this blatant ripoff for what it is; a hollow, empty, soulless movie that reeks of bad story telling and a low budget. Seriously, the script for this movie could have been written on a napkin in 10 minutes.The one line that keeps being quoted here on IMDb is: ""Why are you doing this to us?"" ""Because you were home.""Now this would have worked if it wasn't such a blatant and hollow exploitation of that tried and true horror convention. It's a cop-out if I ever saw one. The movie fails miserably in trying to convince us that these are killers without a motive.Avoid, unless you haven't seen movies since the 50s.PS) How this movie has become a box office success is beyond me.

Actually scratch that, it is the worst. The whole film was an anticlimax from the beginning. The acting is OK for a College film maybe, but not for professional actors. Tyler turns in another lacklustre performance and Speedman is OK. The entire film is by numbers and there is not an original thought to be found in the massively excessive runtime, this film could have easily been done in an hour or, with a small amount of creativity or effort they could have made an interesting back-story that would have actually made me care about the characters. When things happen to the characters you simply do not care!The whole film drags and while there is some suspense there are long periods where all we have for company is Tylers unconvincing whimpering and snotty nose.

500,poogy1680,"Entertaining, but could have been much better.",6,1 June 2008,"In essence, this movie is a pretty entertaining thriller, but I can't bear the tremendous lack of plot. Sure, we all know that a wild romp through this kind of terror doesn't always require much of a plot, but this film sets up a plot and doesn't deliver on it. We start out with a lot of story. Crying, hurt feelings, a wedding, a child's scared voice over the phone, even a teaser of the horrors to come. They set this story up to go somewhere, and never do. Even when they send in a friend to sort of rekindle hope in a plot, they stop that pretty quickly. The killers are random and without surprise and do nothing more than terrorize a couple for the better part of ninety minutes. This film has been done many times over and I really hoped for some kind of twist or story to drive the terror we witness. Texas Chainsaw Massacre and Halloween are two movies that come to mind when I think of the right way to do this kind of cookie-cutter terror film. On the plus side, the scares are very decent and the tension is very well captured. The soundtrack is really good and the cunning use of silence is certainly great. I gave this an above average rating for the simple fact that it is a scary film and fun to watch, but I don't see why they bothered setting up a plot if they had no intentions of delivering on it.",The Strangers

Because you won't. The character's actions were predictable and the bad guys were pretty freaking lucky they decided to kill two people that were so stupid and just seemed to complain all the time. At about an hour into the movie, I was trying desperately to keep myself awake, if only to see the ending and take some solace in the fact that the time I had wasted watching this movie would somehow be justified. But it never came. I instead left the theater with a dark void in the place of the seven dollars I had paid to get in. The only redeeming value this movie seemed to have was it's cinematography and the use of somewhat creepy music. The acting was also stellar, too bad the director chose to waste such a talented cast on such a horrible script.",The Strangers
502,howardad1,Scariest Movie I have ever seen!,9,3 June 2008,"I stepped into the theater thinking that the strangers would be one of those dumb horror movies. But I was wrong! The Strangers was a great horror movie. It was fun, exciting, intense, and great to watch. From the first knock at the door, I knew that I would like this movie. Even the suspense build up is the best part. Such as the noises outside, the record player, the knocks at the door, and especially the masks. Immedietly when the credits started I thought to myself that this is in my top five favorites. Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman make this movie the best. With Scott' guns, and Liv's screaming, this movie is the best. If you want to get on the edge of your seat and say Go Liv! Beat him up! then don't come. If you want to cowar back in your seat and say RUN LIV RUN!!!!! Then come on down and take a scream!",The Strangers
503,ninjagaijin,Trite stupefying and ridiculous,3,27 November 2008,"I loved the original Funny Games and heard this film being toted as comparable. The plot and story is weak, while the acting, lighting, sound and cinematography are quite decent. I think no film however should be put up to the glory of the original Funny Games that does not deserve it (this film definitely not being anything like Funny Games - which was somewhat believable at least and brilliantly shot and paced (the original!!)). This movie starts, peters along and just never gets to where it should have been going. All I wanted was a realistic home invasion scenario or something similar. I love when films like this achieve a kind of simulation of a realistic, horrible event. Then when I watch them I can dissect what happened and possibly learn something that might help me never be in that situation. On the other hand, there are films that do not strive for realism, intelligence or inspiration - IE The Strangers. At the very least, the characters could have been slightly intelligent about the situations or the situations could be slightly more grounded in realism! Also, any film that starts with '*based* on a true event/story' is trying to snap you into suspension of disbelief. Don't fall for it, it's a scam. Nothing is ever 'truth' - ESPECIALLY if it is labeled 'a true' story. How is it possible to remove bias from a perspective/film! Finally, as mentioned by others, if you do have some weirdo knocking at your door, best not call a friend, try calling the police. Sheesh!",The Strangers
504,TheHorrorCowboy,Not worth the $5 bin at Wal-Mart even...,3,18 June 2008,"I'm giving this movie, ""The Strangers"", a 3 out of 10. That is however, because I'm being generous. The film, for the most part, was very dull, and lame. Sure, it may have been based on true events, but still the film was very slow, very dull. When I heard it was a Thriller, and based on true events, I was thinking...well I don't know what I was thinking/expecting. But I wasn't expecting ""The Strangers"". This film, basically tries ""too hard"" to scare you. I felt like I was back in Kindergarden when the Teacher/Teachers would try telling a scary story at Halloween, and would ""jump at you and say boo!"" That's basically all ""The Strangers"" can do. The ending, sucked...I mean, the two boys who talk to the people who committed the slayings... And them just driving off in a Ford truck. I don't know... Maybe I'm being too harsh on this film, but I'd say until either A.) The true story has a little more information known, or B.) They don't make it based off a true story, that they don't waste time on a film like this again. ~Dave, The Horror Cowboy",The Strangers
505,lilwhitehand,What to say about this awful dreck?,1,3 August 2008,"This film is a turd of a turdwellian turdmeister to the turd power. Lets see, a lot of implausible stuff - baddies who can appear and disappear at will, one baddie maybe six feet tall the two others waifish and barely five feet tall against two healthily built people with a shotgun and a lot of magnum shells, victims who just don't want to lock their doors in the face of this sudden brutality, big open swaths of land outside their front door in which the victims could have fled in any number of directions and -o.k. o.k. no more. I guess the movie would have been over in twenty minutes if it tried to remotely approach a tiny little slice of believability.Me so tired of this type of film. Me bet newbies to the horror genre see this and think its the greatest achievement in a horror type thingy. When I think about this film I'm just amazed at how it really missed its mark. Sad thing or maybe the sickest thing is that I couldn't feel anything for the victims and did not care about their fates.Anything positive? Yeah. I got turned on to the sweet musical style of Joanna Newsome. If you can get something worthwhile from this movie than more power to you! Me go now.",The Strangers
506,frootjoose,Potential Home Run - flops due to bad batter,3,27 October 2008,"Since this movie came out in theaters, I have heard a lot of people comment on how insanely scary it is. Three separate people I know each told me that The Strangers was the scariest movie they had ever seen. I talked to an elderly man at the video store, and he told me that no movie since The Exorcist had as much impact on him as The Strangers. My neighbor told me that, upon finishing the movie, they immediately went to double check that their doors and windows were locked.After I finished watching this movie, I scratched my head for twenty minutes, trying to figure out what went wrong.Please understand: I watch a lot of horror movies, but I am not a hardened horror fan. That is, I still get spooked. I'm pretty easily spooked, in fact. And yet, as I think about this movie, I do not look over my shoulders. I'm not even vaguely creeped out. And you know what? That fact is a total travesty. This concept and this movie had such amazing potential to me. I was expecting a classic. And I think it surely could have been a classic.""Why are you doing this to us?"" ... ""Because you were home."" Jesus Christ, it's a door-to-door salesmen selling death and torment. No calculated hatred; no thirst for revenge. Just as simple as ""Knock knock,"" ""Who's there,"" and then a lot of evil stuff happening. It is just so brain-meltingly real! Think about it: you're home alone one night, and this could legitimately happen to you! There is nothing supernatural about it. A trio of people looking to torment and kill really could very easily exist, and all you'd have to do is answer the door. It should be easy to capitalize on this realism and make a genuinely horrifying film.So where did it go wrong? I think the concept was put to death by californication. They took this fantastic, real concept and they made it into a cliché horror film. Rather than focusing on setting up a psychologically terrifying atmosphere in the movie, they rely on Hollywood technique to spook the audience: the creepiness of masks, sudden noises, camera panning to reveal the villain, and haunting background music. They play so much to the audience that I swear I feel like I saw more scary things than the victims did. They take reality and inject it with cheap thrills. This may spook the audience slightly, but it does not build atmosphere, and it does not make a genuinely horrifying movie.For instance. When Kristen is facing the camera and I see a man in a burlap mask walk into the room behind her, that makes me hold my breath. But it does nothing to Kristen. Kristen doesn't know he is behind her. The man's appearance there only benefits me, and serves to real purpose towards the person he is actually supposed to be tormenting. In effect, all this does is remind me that I'm watching a movie.Now, in your standard horror flick, this is sensible. But when you want the movie to be REAL, those cheap thrills destroy the atmosphere. Newsflash: Real killers and tormentors don't stand behind you and stare at the camera in front of you. So that technique reminds you that it's not real; it's obviously just a movie, because the bad guys are more concerned with scaring the viewer than their victim.I don't know if this has made a whole lot of sense, but to be short about it, the problem is that they've taken a very real, very unsettling concept, made a movie out of it, and then made it excessively obvious that it was just a movie by using cliché horror movie techniques.I dunno. To me, there is no greater tragedy than when an excellent concept is destroyed in order to be mainstream. Such a tragedy is The Strangers.",The Strangers
507,WerewolfWinters,Strangers in masks surrounding MY house? FREAK THEM OUT BACK!,1,12 September 2010,"Now, I love, adore, and search out horror movies. It's kind of a hobby of mine to find good horror movies and watch them - but I was highly disappointed at The Strangers.First off, they come from (I think) a wedding reception so they're all dressed up and the male and female lead are planning on spending the night at a friend's remote place with no neighbors in view, nothing. When the the strangers finally do show up, it's first the girl - her face covered in shadows and all she asks, in a monotone, is if someone named Tara is home.And than the guy in the burlap sack (which kept reminding me of Dr. Salvador from Resident Evil 4) somehow gets in the house? Again, this would not have been an issue if I were in charge - the doors and windows would've been locked - and considering the strangers resort to tearing down the front door later kind of reveals that they don't have the the finesse to lock pick.And I have to question why the girl's boyfriend left her alone in the house to go buy a pack of smokes after the woman asking for Tara went by.There's a lot of shots where one of the Strangers is standing in the background watching the chick but she never notices - meanwhile her cell phone's charging up and not on her (mine would have been charged up and ready to go BEFORE I got to the remote cabin - but you know, I'm paranoid like that). And there are a bunch of ""creepy"" sounds that frighten her and she intentionally goes to look for the source without a weapon of any form. I would've had knives on me out the wazoo and probably already would've found that lovely little shotgun they had later.Oh, and let's not forget when Burlap-Sack-Man stares into the window and creeps the hell out of the chick. She jumps, closing the curtains and than he's gone.This movie is just so contrived, lame, and boring! Even the ending was anti-climatic and there was little to no gore and blood! OH! And we don't get to see the killer's faces! That angered me off to no end!In fact! I'll make a BETTER Strangers movie! Ready? Here we go!Strangers are tormenting the poor girl in the house! What does poor girl do? She decides to have fun with THEM! Turns out he's ****ing psycho! So, the guy's staring into the window trying to weird her out, shes hugging the shot gun close to her and rocking back and forth in front of the window, still staring right at the Burlap-Sack-Man, kind of twitching and giggling ""hysterically"". Later she's walking around with a giant stuffed pink bunny (shotgun still in hand), rocking as she walks, with several butcher's knives stabbed into the bunny's head, etc. etc.... ....I could take that longer and make the whole movie my own but.... I think I'll stop since than it wouldn't be a review any more...Moral of MY mini-story there? You don't f*** with the person who's CRAZIER than YOU!",The Strangers
508,gav_walmsley,The scariest film I have EVER seen,10,24 April 2011,"Spoilers ALERT I have an unusually high tolerance for horror films. I have seen so many that only a few actually get to me. The Strangers for me, was the most brutally terrifying one to date. The setting and story are simple, a man and his girl return to his family summer home after a friend's wedding reception where they are tormented by three masked strangers. At first I didn't get this film. The lack of a decent plot threw me off what the film was trying to achieve. However, and to those who complained about the lack of a plot, the film doesn't need a story. The film doesn't need sustained progression. It simply desires to poison what we would refer to as ""home"" - the feeling of being safe and secure, hence the chilling answer to Kristen's question near the end of the film as follows: Kristen: ""Why are you doing this to us?"" Pin-up Girl: ""Because you were home."" This simply means that they were attacked because they were in a place in which they felt secure, hence no place is truly home. The soundtrack was amazing, and contributed very well to the film i believe (for example when Kristen is alone and one of the strangers knocks on the door the words of the song playing are ""Should we go outside?"")Bertino plotted the movie and thought it through thoroughly because I think he did a sterling job in creating genuine fear without using cheap scare tactics like frights, or the face-in-the-bathroom-mirror. Most of the scare tactics were actually quite subtle I thought, especially in the first part of the film. The one shot which truly frightened me was the shot where Kristen is standing in the house in silence and the male stranger emerges behind her and watches her without her noticing. The movie had a sadistic, playful atmosphere which made it even more discomforting for me (e.g. when the Pin-Up Girl was sitting on the swing, and the fact that the masks all had smiles on the faces). Technically i thought it held its ground and I loved the lighting, particularly in the opening scene when Kristen and James are driving to his summer home. I think what really got to me though, and once again i give props to Bertino for his work, was the fact that there were three strangers and that you never knew where they were, but you knew that they were there (e.g. when Kristen discovers the fire-detector has been reassembled but we heard and saw nothing) The strangers themselves were really frightening. Their movement was usually subtle but threatening in that same way which frightened me senseless. All of the masks represented some kind of childlike playfulness as well(the ""cartoon"" pin-up girl, the ""doll's"" face, and the home made smiley sack face) which added to the playful atmosphere and made Kristen and James seem like toys. It even made the entire ordeal feel like a children's game in the strangers actions (e.g. the pin-up girl on the swing) and obviously the fact that all the masks had smiles on them (implying enjoyment). And of course we have the masks which I have yet to get over, which I believe dehumanises them because it hides the only true physical quality which makes us human - our faces. But the masks themselves resemble human expressions and faces but distorts them (a doll's face and a cartoon face represent human faces but are not real faces as such) allowing us to never leave the fact that they are people, but the falseness of their expression implies the lack of true emotions, and more importantly sympathy.Overall i think The Strangers is really underrated because I think that its purpose is misinterpreted. It may not be the world's finest film, but it did a fantastic job of scaring me silly. It didn't follow the boobs and blood route like most other slashers and i thought it was really well directed and thoroughly thought out. If you're willing to give it a chance then please do, you might be surprised. It will scare you senseless.",The Strangers
509,jonaslady36,I have no idea why this is getting such harsh reviews(contains one minor spoiler),8,11 March 2013,"People are being WAY too harsh on this movie. Is it a perfect movie? No. But I am incredibly impressed with it over all This movie isn't just cheap scares (for the most part). The makers of this movie did an incredible job of coming up with new ways for the strangers to deliver their scares My one problem with the movie is the abilities of the strangers. Even though they are human, there are some points in the movie where they are depicted as a bit more, which took away from the scare factor. Specifically, there is one part where the stranger is standing behind one of the main characters, and then a second later it's as if he evaporated into thin air. This made it less scary because it became easier for the audience to go "" oh well that could never happen in real life so I am not scared anymore"". If they just took those little bits out, it would have made the movie infinitely Better. The strangers is still worth seeing either way!",The Strangers
510,ailsaz,Pointless waste of my money,2,7 June 2008,"This movie's characters had absolutely no plot line. The characters of James and Kristen are absolutely flat, and other than the beginning scene I have no idea what these characters are about. The main ""horror"" of this horror film is simply the loud sound affects and quick-cut camera angles that become rather predictable after a while. There is no real incentive for the ""strangers"" to kill the leads and when the villains of the story remove their masks, the act is utterly pointless. They are not people the main characters recognize, and we never get to see their faces.The scene in which the friend comes is utterly predictable. As soon as I saw him, I leaned over to my friend and told her, ""He's going to die first"" and she replies with an ""of course"". We even know HOW he is going to die.This is a thriller with no plot driving it and I could not relate at all to the characters, and after a while I didn't even care if the main characters lived or died. Save your money--this film was a waste of money and a waste of time. I cannot comprehend why a brilliant actress such as Liv Tyler would want to star in this atrocity of a script--did she not read it before taking the job?Save your money, watch something else that is actually worth it.",The Strangers

The main characters don't seem to recognize the killers, and WE don't even get to see their faces. Taking off the masks felt like it should have been a climax, and boy, it sure wasn't.3.

512,BretonFianderAMC,Don't let this terrifying and underrated movie be a stranger to you,8,29 October 2013,"Okay, yeah, bad pun, I know.After leaving a wedding reception, Kristen McKay (Liv Tyler) and James Hoyt (Scott Speedman) go to the Hoyt family's summer home where they are terrorized by three masked murderers, but I do take the murderer part very lightly, if you see the film for yourself to find out why I say that. I watched this movie a couple nights ago as I was doing a 'Seven Days to Halloween Movie Marathon', where everyday from the 24th of October to Halloween I would watch a horror movie, or at least a movie that was on Netflix's Halloween Favorites section, and I finished watching it with one thought, 'That was a really scary, intense movie', and you know what? It really was good.This movie had some really great scares and intense moments to it, and some of the creepiest moments were when you see the man with the bag over his head in the background in a few scenes, and also when Liv Tyler's character was looking out the window and the same man appears out of nowhere, and also those moments where you see one of the ""Strangers"" and in the next shot they disappear, those scenes were creepy.One thing I love about this movie is actually the fact that there was almost no blood in the movie at all, with a couple exceptions, not to spoil anything, but I loved that about this movie, I mean yes, there was some blood seen in the movie, but it mainly focused on scares rather than blood.I'm not really going to talk about the movie that much more, but all I'll say is that it's a highly underrated horror movie with some great scares and intense moments, it's definitely one that I'll come back to time and time again, I'm going to give it a 4/5.

The movie had no real story line, other than the couple's couldn't commit to marriage boo-hoo story. There is no reasoning, and nothing interesting going on what so ever through out this movie. If you're waiting for something surprising to happen, you're in trouble, because everything is predictable. The mere fact that all Liv does is cry and doesn't bother to fight, is ridiculous. Anyone who says this is up there with ""The Shinning"" or ""Halloween"", either has no taste or is working for this movie.

The very effect-full use of sound and noises adds to the already tense and creepy atmosphere. Jump-scares are used pretty effectively as well, not too many of them, while they might be predictable in some parts during the film they still manage to catch you off guard. The fact that the killers don't kill their victims at the first given opportunity instead toy and play mind games with them first. This film is also a tribute to some of the classics of the slasher films, for ex. (Halloween, Friday the 13th, Black Christmas and Texas Chainsaw Massacre). However in the film there are a lot of dumb decisions made by the characters, no character development, no real plot, not routing for the characters and all the coincidences that could possibly happen in a horror film happens, along with lazy writing and no background story at all. So overall, not one of the best horror films I've ever seen but certainly not one of the worst, but one of the most tense and creepy ones I've ever seen",The Strangers

The story is about as generic as they come, The Strangers has a plot we've all seen many times before. A couple goes out into the woods and gets tormented by people in masks. I wouldn't be so bothered by this if the movie did something different with its plot or thrown in a twist to keep me engaged but it sticks with the same cliche's that all modern horror movies seem to rely on. There is a massive amount of jump scares and loud noises but there aren't any true scares.

516,filmman56-1,Adding To A Disturbing New Genre,1,7 November 2008,"I was watching the extras portion of this DVD for only one reason: I desperately desired an explanation for the reasons behind the making of this film. After all, when I've just been bludgeoned with ninety minutes of unmotivated, gratuitous violence, all without justification, I feel I am owed that explanation. I was expecting to be disappointed when suddenly, during the last minute, the director finally revealed his motivations. It seems his goal was to put the viewer right there with the victims. ""If the audience feels like they were there, then I'll be happy."" I see. So then... trying to impart to the viewer a sense of what it feels like to be terrorized and brutally murdered is his lofty goal? What kind of sick mind constructs a film based upon such reasonings? After methodically terrorizing the couple all night and into morning, the film ends with the trio observing the tied-up couple tearfully exchanging their vows of love for each other, only to then take turns repeatedly plunging a kitchen knife into them, watching each other die. Bryan Bertino, the films director should be banished from the industry. There is nothing either entertaining or redeeming about this trash called ""The Strangers."" Moreover, this film represents the disturbing growth in the popularity of such mindless, gratuitous violence for the sake of violence. Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman should be absolutely ashamed for signing on to participate in this tripe. The first thing they each need to do is fire their agents and immediately post an apology to the movie-going public in Variety and THW. Are your respective careers in such despair as to need a film like this? And shame on Universal Pictures for putting their brand on this garbage.

518,braveswin13,Pretty good horror/thriller,7,11 June 2008,"Lately I've been searching for a horror movie that would help me return to my days of actually being scared by a movie. The Strangers actually came pretty close to that. Starring Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman as a failed couple who hole up for the night at a summer house, strange happenings begin to occur as a group of killers show up to terrorize them.To be honest, The Strangers delivered a lot more than I thought it would. Instead of filling the movie with gore and kills, director Bryan Bertino opts for a tense atmosphere and chilling shots. There is no doubt that I was seriously creeped by some parts of the movie, and that is something that hasn't happened to me in a long time. After reading the some of the message boards, I saw many people saying that this was a predictable movie. On the contrary, I think it was completely unpredictable and random. That's what gives the movie some of it's charm, is the fact that I really had no idea what was going to happen. More props go to how the film was shot and the score used. The moving camera and orchestral score helped give me the creeps.The only thing that bothered me was the ending. And it's not like it was a bad ending; it just felt like the build-up wasn't worth it. When a movie that's only an hour and 15 minutes has a slow pace, you best believe I wanted to be completely satisfied with the ending. Not completely satisfying, but not horrible either.I think a 7 is about as good a rating as it can get. This movie proved that you don't need blood and gore to get scares, and that atmosphere can still work in a modern-horror movie. I recommend it to horror fans looking for a decent movie that might give you chills. It's not the best horror movie I've ever seen, but it's definitely one of the better ones. Oh, and props to the main killer. Not only was his acting spot on as a Michael Myers wanna-be (notice the head tilt in one scene), but his mask was one of the coolest I've seen in recent memory. Nice!",The Strangers
519,MinionWench,Oh dear...,5,31 August 2008,"Everyone must have seen the trailers by now, and they're selling the film to us good, but after that 30 second promise it just doesn't quite come through with the goods. It's been a while since I've had a good solid scare that has haunted me afterwards and this film held the promise, the psychological terror of a motiveless attack, the thought that one day you could be picked out for no reason and destroyed by, well, a stranger...The film starts on nicely false terms, throw in a semi-scary (unverified) statistic and the concept of this being a true story (actually not a true story, though similar crimes have happened) and we're all set in the belief that some bad stuff is about to go down to some people. We start with a flash forward (to the end), a slightly cheesy 911 call, then back to the present, then a little later there's a slight flash forward then back to the present - simply put it just hops a little needlessly at the beginning, it's not some big revelation that the whole story (story?) hinges on, they just seemed to feel like doing it a few times at the start and then never touch it again.There's way too much build up at the start, everything moves very sluggishly and given that we already know what's going to happen it's quite easy to disengage yourself for about twenty minutes until there's the knock at the door that signifies the real start of the movie. The romance/proposal subplot (subplot?) appears to be there to give the characters some life, and issues, before someone comes along and gives them new issues with an axe. I know some viewers will go into it and pay avid attention to every murmured line at the outset, but seasoned horror-goers will see it for the filler it is. We know this is the bit where we're supposed to start caring for them, so when it hits the fan we'll root for them.So we get the knock and the spooky whispering begins. If you're saying something intimidating it must be in a breathy murmur, clearly. I kind of liked how it was made clear from the woman at the door (and that strangely dodgy light bulb) that we weren't going to be seeing any faces of the Strangers. It was more amusing than foreboding but it sort of set the status quo for the rest of the film - this won't be entering any new territory.OK, credit where it's due I loved the use of music here, particularly at the start where it helped build up to that knock quite nicely. Often I found that if I covered my ears though, and just watched a) I didn't miss anything, and b) the little bit of spook was gone. I did also enjoy the slightly arty feel of the film (art student, can't help it!), it was very pretty to look at at times, in a slightly twee setting with hazy colours and nice use of lighting and shadows, but the shots of the film just felt so full of the cliché (oh look, her phone is on the fire they can't call for help now...) that it didn't make up for much.I understand what some others have said about the Strangers drifting like ghosts, they really didn't seem to actually be there except to walk around behind people. Ditto the fact that the couple just run or limp) around and around, I know it probably wouldn't have guaranteed survival but had they chosen a direction to run in and stuck with it they could have run all the way to civilisation the amount of faffing they did. And once the Strangers appeared all interaction between this struggling couple was reduced to 'run!' and 'hide!' or 'get inside!', the conflict brought in for them at the outset practically forgotten.Another thing often mentioned is the varying opinions on the amount of blood. The blood here is fairly irrational, while you can explain for the half destroyed state of the house (which the couple probably damaged just as much as the outsiders in between their Starsky and Hutch ""behind the boxes with a gun""...) by the end there seems to be a fair amount of blood for very few actual wounds. Not to mention the fantastic near bloodless stabbings. In a horror it's a bad sign if you can't remember whether or not there was blood on the knife as they were being killed. And wasn't that just such a calm and clear-headed stabbing. No vicious frenzy, no violence or sense of madness or thrill for the Strangers after all that pursuit. It felt like after all that running even they couldn't be bothered with it anymore.And the ending? Eh, the ending was just mostly unnecessary. When it's daylight it's less scary, especially when you know the strangers are now unmasked and 'normal' (as in still doing the breathy murmur to spook small children). Then one final scare and fin. Why? Just because.I just left it feeling underwhelmed. I'll write this and just forget I ever saw the film, which feels like a shame. I wanted to be terrified and it just didn't happen. Casual horror/movie folk may like it, but if you've been around the block a bit I don't know, it doesn't bring anything fresh in a genre already filled with the same story but different - and probably better...",The Strangers

521,jacksmehoff,Cliché anyone?,6,19 August 2016,"Really not a bad horror movie it was entertaining. However, not sure about you 'guys' but it annoys the hell out of me when characters do the most stupidest obvious wrong things they can possibly do. Spoiler alert: For example one guy gets his car windshield broken from a brick jumps out all scared but never bothers calling the cops maybe he thought it was okay, yah take your time 'dude' its only your life, then he proceeds into the house after noticing his friends car destroyed. Hey 'man' nothing is wrong right now just keep pretending its all normal nothing is happening! His biggest mistake and i saw this one coming a mile away was to not call out to see if anybody was still around or doing okay instead walks silently into an ambush, they always gotta move super slow-mo its freakin annoying, getting accidentally killed by his friend, oh no. This is just one example there are more if you have half a brain you might wanna wear a head cap so your not pulling all your hair out, im already bald. All in all it was worth the watch i recommend it to others.",The Strangers
522,alishearer-69327,Terror is the perfect word to describe this movie,8,14 May 2021,"'The Strangers' revolves around a couple, devastated from the rejected proposal whilst being terrorised by a trio of maniacal psychopaths.The plot is very basic but manages to terrify you effectively, without primarily relying on jumpscares.I'm not sure if it's the realistic situation that the couple are involved in that makes this so petrifying or the fact that there are three blood-thirsty killers running wild.What makes this movie unique in amongst its less than pivotal plot, is that the characters have a backstory, therefore when the movie results in its tragic finale, you have sympathy for these characters, instead of having no sympathy whatsoever with unlikeable characters provided with every stereotypical slasher movie.What's most unsettling about this movie aren't the jumpscares, but the long, silent shots that lack music but are great with tension. Scenes that are particularly fond of this style is the iconic shot where one of the killers are creeping around in a darkened corner whilst the female lead is none the wiser.I wanted to talk about the jumpscares in this movie because I picked this up on my second viewing; every jumpscare is used in a necessary way. While there is the odd fake jumpscare, 95% of them involve the Strangers' torment, and are not a classic 'knock into a heavy object creating a loud noise cliché'.The end is one of the best parts of this movie; the fact that there is no motive, the fact that once they have taken their masks off, the couple know, they aren't going to survive, and of course, the chilling line, ""Because you were home.""
The only thing that I can think of that I wasn't too fond of was the sequel baited final scene which was never lead upon - if you don't count the pointless sequel - but if you disregard the moment, there isn't much to complain about.Some may dislike the slow pacing towards the beginning, but with its brief 80-minute runtime, it's a thrilling, unforgettable ride.",The Strangers
523,sinatrad,Scary prequel to a film that has yet to be released.,10,12 June 2008,"Does watching the Pistons lose a hard fought basketball game on a last second shot somehow go back in time and ruin the previous forty-one and a half seconds for me? No. I've already enjoyed watching the game. But perhaps that enjoyment makes the final seconds all the more painful. This is kind of how I felt leaving the theater after watching The Strangers the first time I saw it.I read reviews criticizing this film for being ""pretentious"" and ""nihilistic"". I thought, ""Hell, I really really liked Funny Games (1997) (2007). Pretentious nihilistic home-invasion thrillers are right up my alley."" Reading that a modern horror film is nihilistic is about as useless as reading that it is bloody. It's good to know; but if it wasn't bloody and nihilistic it wouldn't be modern horror and I would have been able to tell from the previews. Pretentious is something different, and it is something that I don't completely object to in the context of horror. I appreciate it because for horror to evolve it needs a fair amount of experimentation with ostentatious premises and the like.The Strangers is not pretentious. The Strangers is probably the least pretentious horror film I have enjoyed in some time. It is however nihilistic. We meet a couple who may or may not be breaking up on this night. They are terrorized by people in masks for an hour or so. They are captured and tied to chairs. Each of the three strangers take off their masks and insert their knives into the defeated man and woman. This is the story. It could be great, gratuitous, or excruciatingly boring or cheesy. First time director Bryan Bertino does an amazing job scaring us for the hour or so that the young couple is terrorized, so it winds up being a pretty decent film. It is necessary to show some blood at the beginning so as to promise horror fans blood and implore them to pay attention to this couple bickering. A flash forward is the most logical way to show blood, and cannot be considered pretentious.My initial disappointment with the film was in its ending. The strangers coldly and cruelly murder their helpless victims. While they're driving away from the scene of the crime they stop two twelve year old boys and ask for one of their religious pamphlets. The boy asks, ""Are you a sinner?"" The young woman responds, ""Sometimes."" As the three murderers drive away one says to the other something like, ""Don't worry, it gets easier every time."" Yes, the audience has a right to expect an explanation for the death and pain that we have just witnessed these hip twenty-somethings cause. Does not knowing why they've done this ruin the first 89 minutes of the 90 minute film? We expect to hear something about revenge or psychosis. Even in Funny Games we know that the assailants are assaulting their victims for the pure joy of assault. Here we are given no explanation and are told that the victims were not sacrificed for the joy of killing; at least one of the murderers had a difficult time murdering.What sets The Strangers above other well executed horror films, is its tremendous discipline. Bertino tells us absolutely nothing about his monsters. They look like cool scene kids when they aren't wearing their masks. One either smokes too much or has asthma (I'd guess he's a smoker). They do not have an easy time killing, but for some reason feel they must kill. There must be a sequel, and this sequel must introduce us to these characters and their motives. It is very ballsy for an unestablished writer/director to exclude this information from his first film, knowing that this decision would be criticized.The film is fun and frightening. Not knowing the reason for the violence is difficult for the audience, and perhaps a slightly cheap decision on the part of Bertino. But America love J.J. Abrams for giving us intrigue instead of answers. Perhaps we owe someone who wrote and directed such a tense and scary film the same amount of respect if he doesn't reveal motive during The Strangers 2, then I think we all have a right to be angry. But for now; I enjoyed myself, didn't you?",The Strangers
524,GinaisaHorrorFanatic,"Disappointing, but not totally awful",4,1 June 2008,"After the first preview I saw of ""The Strangers,"" my first thought was, ""Wow! I can't wait until this comes out!"" By the previews, it looked similar to Rob Zombie's direction style, and it looked like a really edgy, raw film. Going in, I had some really high expectations, and I was ultimately let down by it. The film dives right into suspenseful action, and it is very realistic. The suspense does continue throughout the film, but it loses its shock value over time, because one can only be surprised by the same image so many times. The plot was simple, as it was intended, but it left a lot to be desired. The film was frightening indeed, but not one that kept me thinking or made me lock my doors when I returned home from the theater. I expected a lot more from the film, but I can't say there was nothing I liked about it. The direction and camera work helped to add to the film's suspense, and it definitely helped to keep my attention. The use of sound was incredible, because there was no unnecessary soundtrack. The only music used in the entire film was what was on the record player in the characters' house, and it too was used as a tool to build suspense. For his writing/directing debut, I think the director did an incredible job, but I can't say I enjoyed the film as an avid horror fan. I would recommend this movie to anyone who is easily frightened and enjoys being scared, someone who views horror films strictly for entertainment, and does not have much to judge them on. However, for any horror film buffs with a variety of films to compare this one to, and a list of things to expect from a horror film, this one is one that can wait until it can be rented.",The Strangers

The writer decided it would be great if instead of the killer, the couple's best friend comes around the corner and gets shot by them, right before he would have helped save them.Awesome.I'm a huge fan of horror and gore, but I left this movie feeling it was an incredible waste of time and money.If I could give it zero stars, I would.",The Strangers

It has parts where it is very scary, and although there are rampant clichés, they rarely take away from the overall intensity of the film. Admittedly, there are many plot holes that simply don't make sense. However, if the questionable scenes were undertaken another way, the film would have ended a lot sooner and a lot less dramatically. So if you can get over the slight stupidity of the characters, this film is an enjoyable gem that knows how to scare and please a viewer. I do hope that the rumours of a sequel are true and it soon comes to fruition!",The Strangers

It was very predictable and also had one of the worst endings to a movie i had ever seen. It had no twists or surprises. Also, throughout the movie the decision making of the couple was far-fetched and ridiculous. I was not scared the least bit. And as an addition, the quality of the sound and vision is a joke. It looks like it should be an independent film. There is also very very little action and it seems as though it could be so simple to fall asleep while watching it. But, I have to say some good things about the movie, after all i did give the film a four out of ten, which i think is generous. This movie did have a hand full of alright scares. But there was just too much creeping around and not enough action. I think they have the right idea, but need to do some serious building on this. It has potential, but not much...or just not enough to see for a second time. This is not a film to see a second time...if even a first time.

533,grimm1976,"This film is silly, pointless and boring",2,9 June 2008,"Well, the preview looked good, but the movie doesn't deliver. It's creepy...but it's not. The Strangers is not much better than any of the lousy remakes coming out these days. While the killers appear to be interesting, they really aren't. The two main characters have little dialog of any interest and their decision-making skills are sub-par, even for a slasher flick, which the Strangers really isn't. What the director almost creates in mood and atmosphere, quickly loses weight with the tedious repetition of the same old suspense sequences over and over again, with little deviance. While the teenie-boppers will enjoy the 'jumps' of this movie, there is no substance to the overall suspense. The ending is a lame effort at defeating an anticipated climactic ending, which left me feeling extremely jipped. My expectations were neither high or low for this particular film, so I entered it with an open mind. I was disappointed at the lack of any development on the part of the killers,(or the victims for that matter) who had potential to really steal the show. Instead, they just sort of appear, disappear and re-appear and then at the end do nothing to vindicate their entire efforts at tormenting their victims. I'm glad to see there are a few others on here that didn't buy into this sorry excuse for a movie, because I actually feel sorry for those who enjoyed it. And I feel sorry for anyone who has paid the theater admission to see it and know, whole-heartedly, that based on it's previews, people will still pay their hard earned cash to see it, despite any negative reviews.",The Strangers

The main plot was okay (although we seen it before and done a lot better). The big problem with this movie is the pacing. The pace of the movie was mind numbingly slow. It was so boring I had to fast forward through most of it. The parts that were supposed to be scary were just uninspired. The movie lacked any kind of suspense. The only thing that was a little scary was the stabbing at the end. Other than that, this was a huge waste of my time. I can't imagine who would find this scary in any way. It wears you down with sheer boredom, I'd rather watch paint dry. 2/10",The Strangers
535,louhazosc,Review of The Strangers - CONTAINS SPOILERS,2,1 June 2008,"I have used IMDb for years but have never registered to submit a review. However, after reading positive reviews on The Strangers and actually having it compared to ""The Shining"" and possibly being the best horror movie ever I HAD to comment.First off, one of my favorite horror movies for scary and suspense is The Ring and horror movies I love are classics such as The Shining, The Exorcist, and comedic as Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness, The Saw series has also impressed me MOST of the time (3 was a dud). If you consider my choices terrible then stop reading, this review will not cater to you anyway.Movies such as the Shining were incredible based on imagery and superb acting. Nightmares were brought onto the screen and it was not necessary to jump out and scare you. The twin sisters at the end of the hall just sucked! Images from the Ring - need I say more. Again there were the jump scenes but the images still scare me when I work alone at night in the office. Oh and the suspense just seeing water leaking into the room knowing that she was coming.This DOES NOT happen at all in The Strangers. In 2008 horror has escalated to a point where it is difficult to cause a scare without the jump out and scare you. So The Strangers went the route of ""The Sick and Twisted Family"" who you see every single scene of in the previews. Guy in the burlap mask stands ominously in the kitchen without Liv seeing him....oooooo scary. The girl stands in the woods 100 yards away....oooo terrifying. The other girl is on the swing...oooo not that. They banged on the door and window a few times to really increase the tension though. Two times the girl even asked ""Is Tara home?"" is that ""I am so stoned"" voiceThat was it!!! I promise you. Oh wait, the guy in the mask jumped onto the window once when Liv was looking out. OK, you got me, I jumped. Every line that the Strangers say in the previews is their complete dialog - ""You're gonna die"" and ""Because you were home"" THAT WAS IT. Well, a couple more at the very end. You want a sick twisted family?? Rob Zombie hit the peak on that one, sorry. What's in the killer's head is far more scary than a mask...Hannibal maybe?So eventually The Strangers make their way in. Oh, disturbing images and massive bloodshed that made this rated R? Are you serious? You ready? Liv cuts her hand really really really bad, a shotgun blow to the head where the impact isn't show but the body is on the ground for a while and some head is missing, then the grand finale? Our main characters are tied up and a butcher's knife is slowly inserted by each Stranger into the victims, 2 in the guy, one in Liv - no blood...Movie over. You like it?",The Strangers
536,leepaxton,Edge of my Seat,10,11 June 2008,"For me, this movie had me on the edge of my seat for just about the entire movie. I felt like I was actually watching this happen to these two people. It seem to have a feel of the old 70 horror movies. At times, the music that was played on the record player was even eerie. If you are looking for a movie that will lift you up and make you feel good after watching it, this is NOT the movie to see. This movie does not have a happy ending and there is not much that you find out about the killers(which makes the movie more of a mystery). If you like movies that keep you on the edge of your seat and make you place your hands over your face at various times through out the movie, then this is the movie for you. However, this is just my opinion. I went with two other friends. One of them could not stop screaming and the other said the movie was not really scary just disturbing. I gave this movie a 10(excellent). This movie could not have been any better.",The Strangers

But overall, it is a great terrifying movie.This movie, in my opinion, goes against the grain and is unlike most of the modern scary movies that are coming out now.Yeah, there are jump scenes. Maybe a little too much.But the scariest part in the entire movie is when the terror is in plain sight, right in front of you. There is no scary music, or cutaways to build up to the pure terror that just walks right onto the scene.Sometimes the characters seem a little helpless and pathetic, but honestly; if you were faced with imminent death, i wouldn't be in the right mind to make many smart decisions either.Some people don't like this movie for the ending. There really is no resolution, nothing to help you sleep better. In most new scary movies, the victims always rise up and defeat the bad guys. Well, don't count on that in this movie.That's what is so great about this movie. In real life, there aren't always the happy endings people depict in movies. The movie is honest, and for the most part, realistic.I would definitely recommend this to people who are sick of the hokey 'horror' films that everyone is coming out with recently.",The Strangers

That opening of the movie with the little boys and the story of the movie gave a very creepy vibe and they show you things that make you wonder how they got there. I remember seeing people walk out of the theater it was so scary. And to know that it actually happened makes it twice as scary as it would have been. The villains in the film were very creepy but what made them creepy was the fact they were so simple as in costumes. It was one of the greatest horror movies I have ever seen. The movie was great.

I kept thinking ""Here we go"", ""Okay, this is it"" for the movie to actually get going...but I was wrong each time.The director spends too much time getting us to like the couple in the movie, but honestly does a terrible job at that. The opening sets the stage for a terrific movie. A 911 call saying ""there is blood everywhere"". Really? After seeing the movie, I expect to only see blood in two places, not exactly everywhere.Most of the ""strangers"" actions are done to scare the audience, not the characters in the movie. How many times can the ""strangers"" be seen in the background but the main characters don't realize it...how is that scary to them if they don't know they are there??? The trailer actually is a bit scarier than the actual movie, especially once you see the ending... I still can't believe that the director/writer/et al actually watched the climax of the movie and said, ""that nailed it, perfect!!!""

That being said, I doubt that I'll watch this one again.I was surprised to see that it got the same number of stars on the IMDb viewer rating as did ""Vacancy"". I think ""Vacancy"" was much more frightening (as well as disturbing) than ""The Strangers"". Both movies had pretty much the same premise. Did anyone think it was kind of funny that Scott Speedman (Strangers)and Kate Beckensale (Vacancy)were in ""Underworld"" and these two similar movies together? Interesting. I have to say there were a couple of things that really bothered me.****Spoiler coming up**** The lighting outside in some shots were dark while in the next shot in the same spot was lighter. Then when Scott Speedman and Liv Tyler are in the car getting ready to escape,the ""Maskers"" pull up behind them in the truck instead of trying to drive away and around the truck, they just sit there and get rear ended by the ""Maskers"".

The film follows a fairly straight forward pattern of building up suspense and shocking the audience. Some of these shocks are done quite well and got quite a few jumps and screams in the cinema. This, however, is not where the film fails.It fails for me because of the story and how little it meant. Take for example the bit where they take their masks off. It's done in an incredibly dramatic way but why? We don't know any other characters so mask or no mask they are no more or less sinister. It also seemed a bit cheap the way there was about 400 loose ends leaving it wide open for a sequel so the ""mystery"" can be revealed. And did nobody else think Jason from Friday the 13th? Surely he was the original bag headed murderer. Homage or theft?

542,camiox,Not groundbreaking but gets the job done.,7,26 November 2008,"This movie is getting a lot of undue hate here. Especially since a lot of this movie is a step in the right direction.I really enjoyed this movie. If you want to scare your girl, get this movie. It's creepy, suspenseful, hits home, and manages to pull a few cliché's out on you without noticing. In the middle of the movie I paused it and checked the doors to my house to make sure they were locked and moved away from the window.I'm usually very sensitive to horror cliché's like popping out and making a loud noise. And I can only remember one part from this movie that used that. I think people are imagining this cliché.The cliché's are pulled off believably. I know there are people that are just looking for something to nit-pick but there was only one miss-step in terms of how the characters acted that I can think of in this movie.Plus the eerie creepy goodness easily makes up for the cliché moments. There are enough genuinely skin-crawling scares in this movie to give you plenty of fond memories.one of the genius points I like about this movie is that the killers play with their victims. Just when you think it's over. It's not and the killers continue to mess with their minds. It gets to the point where it seems like the killers play ignorant at certain points just so they can dash the hopes of the victim.I'm raving it so much you might wonder why I only gave it 7 stars.well for all it's goodness, it loses steam towards the end. The final few scenes are rather weak.I still recommend this movie for thriller fans who are tired of all of the thriller/horror movies that are just not creepy or remade from a foreign film.You wont be up for hours after the movie because there is a significant time where the creepiness wears off. But there are tons of memorable moments in this movie.",The Strangers

Kept my finger on the fast forward button throughout the entire movie. Annoyingly bad to the point where you consider just ejecting the disc to watch something else.Simply a Hollywood cliché reel. Didn't make me ""jump"" one single time. Every time the movie tries to scare you, if you have watched more than 3 horror movies in your life, you will know exactly what is going to happen. Thus not scare you at all but rather annoy you for being so incredibly predictable you can almost scream along with the characters in sync. Put in a brilliant scientist with a personal problem, some kids and an underachieving hero, and the American-cliché-fest would be complete.Thank god my DVD player has a fast forward button. Because the slow pace of the scenes where they try to be scary, will leave you bored enough to ff through most of the movie.Apparently the masked invaders like to scare the crap out of, and kill, summering wedding guests just for the hell of it. No motive is established, no back story what so ever. Why are the masked people there? Why are they masked if they gonna drop the masks in front of the two (now captured) protagonists at the end of the movie anyway? And not even be recognized by their victims...They didn't steal anything.They didn't rape anyone.They didn't try to gain anything from the good guys (like kidnapping).They didn't seem to take pleasure in torture or violence.They didn't know their victims, so no past grudges.I understand that ignorant middle class Americans' worst nightmare is a home invasion, even though it happens more rarely than an asteroid impact. But they could at least give the bad guys some sort of motive for doing all this. Or make them spooky in some other way. Hell, if they made them ghosts or aliens or whatever, it would lift this movie several notches just by that. But no no, lets just have them be humans, with no motive for scaring and murdering 3 people in their summer house, and then drive off without ever letting you know what the hell they were doing there in the first place...The only positive I can find about this movie is that Liv Tyler actually looks good in this one.",The Strangers

No super powers, no gun, no noticeable fighting skills of any kind (they can knock on a door something fierce if that counts for anything).Before anyone in the house gets injured, the good guy (the movie sucked so bad I don't even remember his name) finds a shotgun. Two able bodies and a shotgun vs. three slow moving targets... Game over right? Apparently not!I've got an idea! I'll send my girlfriend into the house (where we've already seen one of the weirdos a couple of times) and I'll venture out to the shed to see if I can work an old radio with the safety of my shotgun. I'll leave my girlfriend helpless with the strangers in the house. I can only imagine he was mad at her for saying no to his marriage proposal.Story based on true events? That line usually means ""completely fake."" The second line of the movie says ""What actually happened here is still uncertain..."" Which means to me that everyone dies because there's nobody left to tell the story. Guess what? Everyone dies!(OK, the girl gasped for air at the last second but, trust me, she died) Thanks for blowing the ending at the very beginning!What really happened is the authorities probably found three people dead in a cabin and couldn't find the killers and that is the extent of the ""true events."" The rest is just made up BS.All I know is if I had a shotgun with 50 or so shells, I would walk slowly into the middle of the field with my girl and wait for the freaks to show up.The authorities would show up the following morning to find three headless freaks and one proud new owner of an old crappy pickup truck.Sorry if I ruined the ending for any of you but, trust me, I saved you from wasting an hour + of your life.",The Strangers

Now the movie has some good scares it may not be original but its still scary.It was well acted with Tyler and Speedman giving good performances along with the strangers who will definitely give you the creeps,so whats wrong with the movie. 1.Its not very original 2.No character development 3And 3 the ending.from watching the add i was expecting some crazy cult killings but no you never find out why they are killing. Spoiler!!!! there are only 3 strangers a man and 2 women and only 1 of them has lines,in total about 4. when they are asked why they were killing them 1 responded ""because you are home""that is all your told and apparently why they are killing them which is never explained. 6/10 for a few scares and good acting",The Strangers

It didn't have to make sense for them to die and they couldn't have been heroes (they obviously didn't know much about how to use their weapons) My favorite line of the film was when she asks the strangers ""Why are you doing this to us?"" and the one girl responds ""Because you were home."" I think that line is very touchy to a lot of people because it could happen. I also thought their masks were great, very simple but scary. All in all, I thought it was a good film, not an amazing horror film, nor did I really think it was a horror film. A good suspense for sure.",The Strangers
547,aeyoqen,"Slightly creepy, but mostly disappointing",5,15 April 2010,"Finally, I got the chance to see this movie - a film that was hyped to be a true ""scary movie,"" a film that many people told me was one of the better ones, so I sat down to watch it in delight.And I have to say, I was sorely disappointed.The movie had some really great elements in it - the cinematography was good, the colors were excellent, and there were a few genuinely creepy parts that were great. And that was it.I felt like the film took too long to actually start. The very, very beginning was intriguing, and then there was this love issue between the two main characters, that made me bored as opposed to making me care. It would have been fine if it had been half as long, but nothing happened in this movie until thirty minutes in. I sat down to watch a scary movie, not some drama.Introducing the ""Strangers"" was where this film really shone. The guy just barely lit walking in the hall, just barely out of view of the character was so well done, as was the masked girl just standing out in the field. Little things, like the phone being thrown in the fire, or the fire alarm moved, now those were nice touches. I was really enjoying this movie until the guy's friend got shot in the face (another plot element that felt strained and not needed). After that, it was almost painful to watch the Strangers toy with the characters.For this being the director's first film, and being based off of true events, it's pretty well done. But as a horror film, it just doesn't cut it for me. There are a few great creepy moments, some good quick scares, and I have to say I like that the gore wasn't overplayed. Improve the pacing, take out unimportant plot elements, and this film would have been much better.",The Strangers

Maybe it is the creepy masks worn by the killers, maybe Dollface's chilling voice, or maybe just the thought that someone could be watching you from your backyard without you knowing. The script is fantastic for a horror film. I love the acting done by Liv Tyler- you really care about her, you feel like you know her. You really think she is scared. There is more to this movie than your average horror movie. Not guts spewing everywhere, not cheap jump scares, just plain fear. This film is immensely similar to the 1978 Halloween, but twenty times scarier. The movie is rated R for Terror (a lot of it), horror violence (quite a bit), and language. I recommend it for ages 14+, not for material, but for how frightening it is. Of course, know your kids.",The Strangers
550,Dlthill4,A totally on the edge of the seat adventure!,8,20 June 2008,"The Strangers isn't a standard slasher flick, it is a tale woven with suspense and terror. Inspired by true events, a young couple go to a James'family's vacation home. He and his girlfriend, Kristen plan on stopping off on their way to take a road trip. A surprising knock on the door at four am surprises them. When other knocks on windows and doors begin to scare them coupled with the idea that these people have already gotten into the house, they realize the must fight for their lives. The Strangers have come. The director (Bryan Bertino, who also wrote) shows us through different angles, and well framed shots, what lurks in the shadows for these people. This is a realistic story, which is what makes it so terrifying. The movie gives us a taste of what could happen, and a glimpse of what true terror could be. It is a scary ride from the beginning, and I think true suspense/horror fans will enjoy.",The Strangers

I really did. The premise was good (albeit unoriginal), the trailer showed some promise, and it got decent reviews - so I though ""hmmm this might be pretty decent""Wrong.""The Strangers"" turned out to be one of the most annoyingly-clichéd horror movie I've seen for a while. Characters separate and leave each other alone? Check! They run back into the house? Check! They crawl away from the bad guy? Check! It's all there! What worries me, however, is all these comments I read about how its ""the scariest film ever!"". What the hell?! Come on, seriously? While I believe everyone has their own opinion, and while I didn't enjoy the movie, I know a lot of people did (including my friends whom I went to see the movie with), but to say its the scariest film ever...this just baffles me!And now I read a sequel has already been confirmed. Now I've lost even more respect for this film. While this wont be on my ""Top Ten of 2008"" list, it had a few good things about it, the main being it seemed like a STAND ALONE FILM! It doesn't need a sequel, its a random story based on real events. Why the hell does everything need a sequel these days? *sighs*When the movie Cloverfield came out, Empire magazine printed a very positive review, with a little comment at the end, along the lines of:""If they ever make a sequel, deduct two stars from the rating""Consider that my final comment of this poor attempt at a promising idea!",The Strangers

Like I understand a person might sometimes not have a solid plot, but can they at least make a freaking effort??? There is no plot or storyline or premise whatsoever!!! I'm so blown away by the rating of 6.2??!! This is so unfair to the great horror movies out there that have less than that high rating, if not the same; it just doesn't do them any justice! I don't understand what's wrong with you people? I swear by the end of the film I couldn't explain my anger and frustration ( Even though my roommate who's 7 years younger than me warned me from watching it) I even started cursing out loud and to myself! With a budget of $ 10,000,000 I could turn my idea for a feature film into a film, and I could do that with less than a million!!! All you need is a strong, solid story! There's zero talent or originality in this, no plot/ storyline, we know nothing about the reason behind the killings and absolutely nothing about the characters and their back-story with dialogue that's mediocre at best! It started off all right and somewhat promising, but it looks like the writer and director just didn't know where to take it from there and what to do with the story so he just wanted to get it over with and finish the project any way possible; it becomes painfully boring! I must say the only good thing about this was the acting, I'd give them credits for that. Such a waste though it was put in an utter piece of garbage like this! It's like having the icing on the cake without the cake itself. Nominated the best horror film of the year??! My ...! What year are we talking about?! This cliché piece of c**p is super ridiculous and is highly overrated; please avoid it at all costs. It's an hour and a half that you're never getting back! I give this piece of s*** a rating of 1/10 and that's being generous (Because obviously I can't go any lower) It doesn't matter what great actors you have, if there isn't a story to start with in the first place, you basically don't have a movie.",The Strangers

""The Strangers"" is scaringly, horrifyingly stupid and boring.There are so many plot holes that makes this movie has no plot whatsoever. They gave details that they can't even explain! Who is Tamara? Who are the killers? Why did they take off their masks? Why don't they show who the killers are? Why are there 3 of them? Why did they kill the main characters? Why didn't the girl die? Who are the kids in the ending? There are so many unanswered questions that I don't even know why they try to make this movie. I don't know why they make it an hour and a half either. Could easily be wrapped up in a 5 mins short film and it would be much, much better. The scenario of unknown, masked killers coming to your house, threatened you and kill you maybe scary in real life (as they said it's based on true event), but they executed it terribly in this movie.This movie is so slow and does not make any sense, I kept waiting for a reason why it's actually rated 6.2, maybe they will have a great plot twist (even though they give absolutely no context to have a plot or a twist to begin with) But the ending is very disappointing, much like the movie itself.The acting is also terrible. I only give this a two because it managed to scare me once or twice with the overuse of scary music (which is also a bad thing, because if you need to scare people with music, that means your movie and/or plot is not scary enough) That's it.

In fact, Halloween is the only movie that has ever given me that insecure feeling when walking into a darkroom. I haven't had that feeling in a very long time. This movie brought that feeling back in a hurry. This movie is one that will scary many people because many individuals can relate to it. In many horror films you see someone do something stupid like not calling the police, not grabbing a gun, running up the stairs. However, that is not the case in this movie. The other reason I gave this movie a 9 is because they recapture something that I haven't seen done since Halloween. If you remember in Halloween when Myers is always lurking in the background and the characters never see it and you get that ""Oh No"" feeling, well this movie also captures that aspect as well.

I'm a big fan so horror movies and so i really wanted to see this one. The beginning started out really slow and dumb, but the movie got better after about 15 minutes. The director of this movie decided to veer away from the recent horror movies. In stead of the normal loud music, then nothing happens, then quite music, and then the bang, he decides to do something new. The suspense the brought out more. Either we would see the ""stranger"" in the scene when the other characters would not and wait for something, or after the loud music something would actually happen and it wouldn't be a fake out. The anticipation of the attack would keep you on the edge of your seat. One example is when in one scene the male ""stranger"" is walking behind one character with an ax for like 5 minutes and he doesn't know. I don't want to give away the whole movie, but it is great. I personally did not find it scary at all, except for the last 5 seconds.

They started out with a great movie...kept it up throughout and then slammed it in the end. It made no sense and the point was what? The ending was like a cement wall.

564,lil_righter4,Sleep with the Lights On Tonight,10,5 June 2008,"A very simple story: a couple is terrorized by three strangers who invade their home after a friend's wedding reception. The Strangers is a horror film and think of it nothing more than that. Despite its R-rating, this film does not rely on the use of humorous gore and blood. Instead, it relies on something better: tension, suspense, and outstanding character involvement.From the start, it's quite clear about what happens to the two characters. Afterwards, you're thrown directly into the relationship of James (Scott Speedman) and Kristen (Liv Tylor). This is something usual in most modern horror films, because you actually get character development and therefore, you care about them and only wish for the best outcome.Liv Tylor gives an extremely convincing performance as she takes most of the screen time. Her sense of fear is so authentic that you believe you're right there with her. Scott Speedman gives a strong performance that's sturdy. Both act with an alliance with each other and their clique is nothing short of remarkable.The fear factor of the film works heavenly as it is a very terrifying film. The three strangers make a presence that digs deep into your worst fears and pulls it out of you only to serve it to you raw. The cinematography is their weapon and the sound mix is their dialog.The Strangers is film that will make jump and scream with its unbearable tension that surpasses any horror film made in the past twenty years. For those who are bold enough to see this film, you might want to sleep with the lights on after you do so.",The Strangers

The really big issue from my perspective is you have this huge build up and great suspense and then sadly a cop out of an ending... in fact you could have not seen the ending at all and it wouldn't have made any real difference.***SPOILER ALERT - WARNING I GO ON TO TALK ABOUT THE ENDING HERE SO PLEASE DON'T READ ON IF YOU REALLY WANT TO WATCH THE MOVIE**** ************************************** With this sort of movie where there is a lot of build up, the ending is critical, its got to have some kind of twist.

""This is why I have been sitting here for an hour and twenty minutes... it all comes down to this"".. and then.... nothing... no seeing bad guys faces.... no ""oh my god its you!!"" coming from the good guys... just bad guys stab good guys.... bad guys leave... credits roll. Just me left sitting there with a dumbfounded look on my face and hand outstretched in the air in disbelief. I would have even preferred something unoriginal or ridiculous for the twist instead of nothing eg. The bad guys end up being one of their friends, the bad guys end up being aliens, the bad guys end up being part of a new reality TV show in which its all just a setup..... Anything!!

566,ForAFewDollarsMore,The Strangers: Silence has never been so scary,8,1 June 2008,"I just saw The Strangers with my friends this weekend. The basic plot of the movie is a couple going out to a friend's cabin for the night, but are interrupted by people wearing masks terrorizing them. It starts out with just banging on doors and windows, and escalating to them breaking in and physically harming the couple. Now on to my review.The Story: the story isn't anything original, but it definitely plays out very well. I do not want to tell you anymore then i already have, but it is a very scary movie. One of the scariest scenes in the movie is one that you see in the trailer and poster. The one with Liv Tyler standing alone and the man in the mask standing behind her. When he enters behind her the audience i was with was screaming. The scene wasn't as scary during the movie, but later on when your home alone and it is quiet, the image of the man in the mask standing there creeps up in your memory. You have to take a look behind you to make sure he is not standing there. There are other memorable and terrifying scenes but i do not want to ruin it for you. There were parts in the movie that seemed like the typical scare tactic, like the music peeking up to make you jump, but what movie doesn't use those? There was some times where i was wondering why didn't they do this or do that? That is Hollywood for you. It also was a little predictable, but there also were some good unpredictable moments. Also the ending was a little to cheesy for me, but did not ruin the movie for me.Acting: Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman both do a good job as the victims. The people in masks also do a good job. The only have a few lines but they are delivered well and are very terrifying.Conclusion: In a time full of terrible scary movies using cheesy scare tactics and typical scripts. It was scary without having to use anything too flashy. It wasn't the greatest scary movie i have ever seen, but it is the best i have seen in a long time.8 out of 10 not perfect but very good.",The Strangers

As far as I know this is the director's first movie and I suggest he shouldn't make another one if he doesn't take into consideration that a movie must have a plot, suspense and some reasonable facts or at least some facts that can be explained at some point!

It had the feel of an older style horror film, one that does not need a lot of blood and gore (if your looking for guts and brains flying every where, this is not the film to go see) to keep your attention. For someone who does not watch a lot of horror or thriller flicks this will probably creep you out. For those of you like myself, who make a point to see everyone, you will be able to guess everything thats going to happen and simply find yourself on the edge of your seat waiting for it just to prove to yourself your right.This is not a bad movie by any means, the acting is great, especially good performance by Tyler (never pictured her doing a horror flick). The music is down right creepy even if it is blue grass. You will never look at a potato sack the same way again after seeing this. If you do decide to go see this, keep in mind; There isn't much gore, It's intense only because you wait so long for something to happen, and the ending is almost laughable.There is one scene that you should look for, when the male lead is outside, for some odd reason the filmmakers decided to put in a monkey yelling?",The Strangers

Heaven forbid the characters just run away, but no that would be a terrible idea. There was not even a single jump moment in the film either. If you thought this was scary, do yourself a favor and go watch the Spanish movie REC (Record, not Quarentine), and you will experience fear. In terms of endings, this was the most anti-climatic ending in the history of movies. One would think these ""strangers"" would be a little more diabolical in the finale, but nope, pure hog-wash.

Horror came from mostly sounds and music and cheap thrills. (pg-13 jump out scenes really)Kind of has a court TV feel to it when the movie opens. I looked over at my brother when I saw where the movie was going, and said this may actually be good. The suspense at first is a bit scary but it never goes anywhere,and it gets old fast.

573,grownontheocean,I have a hard time understanding,7,28 October 2008,"*CONTAINS SPOILERS*all the egregious reviews for this movie. This is not a horror movie, it's a suspense film and as such it's gonna have a lot of anticlimactic moments. It's supposed to instill a feeling of impending doom, to gradually diminish both the victims in the film and viewers sense of hope as the story unfolds. I've read a lot of comments about how senseless and helpless the couple acts, but that's what's so humanistic about it. It's four in the morning, the victims probably just went through one of the worst nights of their life due to the falling out between the couple, their nerves are shot before they even arrive at the summer house, and then someone starts pounding on the door. I could not imagine anyone reacting reasonably to a scenario like this. They try every outlet of escape and communication to the outside world but the terrorizing trio is always a step ahead of them. I've also seen lots of complaints about how the killers keep allowing the couple to survive, but it's clear that they're sadistic and wanted the couple in a crippling state of horror by the time they're murdered. I thought this was a superbly crafted piece of suspenseful cinema, even though it's not my favorite horror sub-genre. Finally, as an enormous fan of the FX show ""It's Always Sunny.."" I love that Glenn Howerton had a cameo in this film. He still looked and acted like Dennis Reynolds.

This movie is excellent, it is what a ""horror"" should be. the suspense is crazy. i don't want to give anything away but the way the ""strangers"" behave towards the couple is what scares me. they just don't care. i think that if you enjoy movies that are made from the heart(it sounds terrible i know)and are made because the writer/director/producer sometimes even the actors want to make the movie for themselves not just because they want to make tons of money. i heard that a sequel has been given the go ahead and i am looking forward to it, i just hope that it is done in a way that doesn't ruins this movie.like so many sequels do.",The Strangers

576,RelativeDisposition,Weak....weak.....weak.....,5,9 June 2008,"First the positive side: The directing was not totally cliché, I liked where the director was taking the film, but then, it never got there. The initial confrontation and dialog was creepy - the director did not totally rely on shock value initially...The Negative: but then, soon it was all shock value towards the end. Before you know it, the movie is all over, with one final shock\surprise at the very end. The film built up to what could have been a more exciting ending, with the aid of a better plot line, but then just ended.I heard a teenage boy comment outside the movie theater, ""I wasted 5 bucks on that?"" That, along with stating that what started as a promising movie, ended as a cliché with no pizazz, about sums it up in my opinion.",The Strangers
577,andrey_tag-1,Do you trust your significant other?,4,12 October 2009,"I'd like you to think about the following theoretical situation: You are in love with your girlfriend, so much in love in fact that just a few hours ago you have asked her to marry you. You leave your creepy house in the middle of the woods for about an hour and when you come back you find the landline has been cut, your girlfriend's crying and hysterical, and her hand is bleeding profusely. She tells you that she saw a man with a mask in the house. Which of the following seems like a rational reaction:1. Immediately drive the person you love to the hospital because she is pretty badly injured. 2. Call the police because someone you know well and trust just told you there was a break-in. 3. Tell her she is obviously delusional and discard the whole situation as a random burst of (previously unseen) insanity.The third option is a pretty good example of the kinds of decisions characters routinely make throughout ""The Strangers."" Overall the script is alarmingly full of clichés, the main characters are unlikeable, most ""plot-twists"" can be seen coming a mile away, and the only startling scenes in the movie include either loud sounds or disappearing people. Said disappearances range from very implausible to downright impossible and had me convinced for most of the movie that the killers aren't actually people... but that would have made too much sense (where ""too much"" is defined as any at all).That said, the beginning of the movie was pretty good- the actors were given a chance to actually act, there was a very good atmosphere, and everything was bright enough to follow what was actually happening. It's sad to think that if they had just entirely dropped the gore part, this could have been a really good drama or thriller with engaging acting. So if you decide to watch this movie, do yourself a favor and stop when you first see a person in a mask. Then you would have seen an enjoyable if somewhat slow ~40 minute film.",The Strangers
578,fbenchea,Liv Taylor can become a gardener after this....,1,7 September 2008,"I have just finished watching the movie. To put it simply, i counted the seconds left until the end. The movie is perfectly boring and very easy to predict. I don't know how is this movie good (as the other guy comment it) but when it finished, more then half of the people in the cinema rushed to the EXIT and cursed the moment they decide to buy tickets (70% empty cinema). I never wrote any comment before and i always enjoyed just reading, but this movie forced me to write it. I don't want to tell you what is happening in the movie, but i think that if some people are as stupid as those two main characters, than their deaths are no loss to anybody. The killers just did their job to exctinct some stupidity. And yes, i have military training. You don't? Read some survival books.

579,maque-3,Good in All Ways but One,6,2 June 2008,"An excellent premise brought down only by one horrible character who happened to take up a lot of screen time.This movie would have been fantastic if it weren't for Kristen, played by Liv Tyler. Every other actor/actress was fantastic; the horror was realistic. As a college student whose primary focus in their minor of comparative literature is the horror genre, I admit to being, perhaps, overly harsh. But when the ""strong female lead"" tends to fall over sobbing and repeating everything that someone else says back to them as a question, I think of myself as, not harsh, but right. Scintillating conversation does not sound like this:""He wasn't wearing a mask!"" - James ""What do you mean he wasn't wearing a mask!?"" - Kristenor""I'm going outside."" - James ""What do you mean you're going outside?!"" - KristenThroughout the movie, Liv Tyler's acting gets constantly repetitive. She's either repeating phrases back to people or she's making her mouth into an ""O"" (similar to the painting of ""The Scream"" by Edvard Munch) and sucking in air as if insulted. By the end of the movie, my friends and I were longing for her death, be it via ax to the head to knife stabbing.Everything else in the movie is great. The soundtrack fades when it needs to, when it is playing it offers a startling contrast to what is seen. Acting (from all but Liv, as you've heard me complain) is fantastic--Scott Speedman did a particularly good job as James. The fear would have been spot on with its development--the effects look good and the attacks are perfect.But, the low voting comes from Liv--her presence in the scene can turn something horrifying into something laughable. And it is that which downgrades it from a near-perfect 8 or 9 to a 6.",The Strangers
580,canadian_pigmeat,Would you like some suspense with your suspense,8,30 May 2008,"I really liked this movie. The first hour of it everyone in the theatre was jumping and screaming every time the ""strangers"" showed up on the screen. It was really good. Good acting, great camera angles, and the story is alright. It is VERY loosely based on true events. The story seemed pretty fabricated, but i'm sure the actual events were not as movie friendly.In summation, the first hour of the movie... spectacular. The end was kind of a letdown, but I think we've all come to expect a lot less from movies now a days.definitely worth the 10 bucks to see in theaters.",The Strangers

""When will they pop out and attack?"". I liked this movie a whole bunch. I'm not a horror movie fan. But yes, I have seen some. The Strangers has a crappy ending. The movie ends with a Christian boy touching Liv Tyler on the hand and she screams. Despite that the movie was a pretty good movie. This movie was directed well. The cinematography was great.

There are essentially two elements two this film... one; silence suddenly broken by an orchestral hit and a person in a mask popping out or two; silence maintained, but a masked individual slowly stalking the person. The acting was poor, the plot (or lack thereof) was intensely stupid, and the inspiration was cliché.This movie should be retitled ""insulting your intelligence"" ...I hate it more than Garfield hates Mondays.With that said I did appreciate that they didn't show the faces of the ""strangers"" ... and that they killed the victims without remorse.",The Strangers
583,william-b-crawford,Pitiful Excuse for Entertainment,1,16 July 2008,"I like horror films; they're my favorite genre. But this movie was a disappointment.When I see a film, I'm at the very least hoping for at least one of three things: a really beautiful aesthetic look, a good story or great action. This movie had none of those.Following in the well-worn footsteps of Texas Chainsaw Massacre, Strangers is all about jumping in front of the camera a bunch of times, waving knives. You're waiting for story development, but it never comes. Suspenseful, yes. Interesting, only because you want to know one thing: Why.Liv Tyler is a big enough name that I was really hoping for a good script. She can afford to be choosy about what roles she plays. But she spends the entire film, (save about one minute) either crying, screaming or some catatonic mix of both. Not fun or entertaining.***SPOILERS***Spoilers... if you call it that. The shocking twist of the story is that there is no point. They just feel like terrorizing people. The 'strangers' zip about with superhuman stealth... despite being clearly just wanton humans. 50 minutes of 'I'm gonna stab you!'-type shots, then they finally do some stabbing. The thing that made TCM work is that people had seen of that kind of film before. It was new, innovative... even if it really 'torture suspense' was poor entertainment. Unfortunately Strangers is 30 years to late to cash in on that fad.I (and by the looks on people's faces leaving the theater, everyone else around me) felt ripped off. The only reason I stayed in my seat was because I hoped for story resolution. It didn't come.So it comes down to this: If you're really interested in watching nothing more than some people getting terrorized and murdered, you might enjoy The Strangers.

The movie is even much above u can expect, & i m still thinking why it's got the praise universally...The movie has a very few dialogs, & even then it movies forward with a slow pace developing, & then gradually increasing, the tension amongst u. There r the moments that shall make u forget to breathe sometimes, & jump out of ur seats the others.I'll say that I haven't seen an audience enjoying a horror/thriller movie in a theater like this one till day. There were screams, cries, jumps, forceful through back of audience at seats, and at last the laughs of being unable to release the tension the movie built.On of the greatest qualities of ""The Strangers"" is its enormously haunting Sound scheme, which shall help scaring the hell out of u. If not given awards for the sound system, every award show shall be felt faulty.The phenomenon of being alone of a girl at first in a remote & secluded summer house with nobody living nearby, & then accompanying a man who also gets the victim of three dreadful sick people is just good enough to scare u.I could only have one wish though from the movie. The director could have shown the top view of the house & surrounding area in the beginning, which could have developed an instant fear to start with.On the whole, I feel that every lover of horror / thriller movie is missing something in life if still not seen the movie. Worth watching at theater highly.I subscribed to IMDb just few minutes before, only to satisfy myself that at least I also am contributing / tributing the great efforts made by the whole movie team.

I actually waited the entire movie for something to actually happen. It's a good thriller but I wouldn't catalog it as a horror movie but it's a classical movie about some bad guy that keeps popping up behind the characters and then suddenly disappears when they turn around i mean the movie could have been summarized in half an hour action.

588,your_all_sad_knobs,Very very very good,10,30 August 2008,"I am not a big horror fan, especially todays horrors. All blood and gore and no spookiness or suspense. This movie has very little gore but loads and loads of tension that just keeps on and on. I felt I had to write a review when I saw how low the scores this film was getting from all those internet geeks that love the Matrix and don't understand a film because they are a bit insular and cut off(in their own little world). One of my favourite horror movies is The Shinning, but this is as good, though it is a totally different type of film. Some reviews on here go on about how unrealistic this film is, well I think you have to allow a little artistic licence. We don't all behave perfectly safe all the time,sometimes we do stupid things and thats what makes us shout at the screen. Personally I think if you just let this film take you along and stop looking for fault it will scare you loads. How someone can say the Ring is better is beyond me. I guess it comes down to the images that you find scary(maybe they are created in the back of our mind during childhood). I found the bad guys in this film very spooky. Not the greatest film ever and there is not a lot of character development but you get all you need. This is not a deep story, it is not the Godfather or Steel Magnolias if thats what you are after but it does what it is supposed to and that is create tension and put you right on the edge of your seat all the way through.

After we i watched it we watched the bonus features, and the director was saying that he doesn't like to call this movie a horror movie he prefer for it to be called a terror movie, why?

The scares don't come from the killer's violent acts but from the killer's tactic of sneaking and taking the couple by surprise. I mean they move like ghosts in this movie. There's not one time where it seems like the couple has the upper hand. There's a feeling of hopelessness through the film.But there is ONE complaint I have about the movie, and that is the couple in the movie. You know that stereotype in horror movies where the characters are helpless idiots? It's in this movie BIG TIME. I'm amazed these two lasted so long the way they were acting. I understand how the lost their cell phones but their poor actions, the fact they split up a couple times, and the woman does the DUMBEST thing before the climax that made me wonder how they survived that long!

Then when it became evident that the two main characters were going to be chased back and forth and endlessly scared for the rest of the film - it became extremely boring.

597,criticofmovies,Underestimated,8,30 January 2009,"""The Strangers"" takes you for a terrorizing ride where a young couple battle for their lives one night after a party. I just bought the film on DVD. And although i saw it in theaters i never really thought too much about it, and had many questions-like many other people. Now I'm able to look closer at what people are missing. First of all, i do realize this is a movie. However, reading through a large number of comments and the posts on the message boards I notice people are really controversial about this film. This whole premise of this movie is to show fear, and to portray terror to the audience without having the typical ""slasher"" movie scenes. I found it very effective seeing as I love a good horror movie, however i do not like blood and guts. What i noticed most about the comments I have read, they say the characters are ""unbelievable"" and ""no one would ever do ""said thing"" (ie, leave phone in the car, not shoot the one stranger when hearing something behind you etc.) But, how are we to know that we would handle the situation better? When faced with true terror, do your legs not shake, and do you not think irrationally? In all reality I would love to put those people in the same position and see what they do, and i think they'd think next time before speaking up. This movie puts you in the spot of the actors, letting you feel the terror they feel knowing that at any moment someone will come at you through that door with a knife. All in all, great movie. People underestimate this movie a lot. They don't see the great psychological terror these ""strangers"" put on the characters. And it could in fact be realistic.",The Strangers

This movie has everything you need for a key film. It's the type of movie that gets to you when you're home alone at night. The best thing about the movie, which is what most Horror Films lack these days, is it's SCARY.

Well they must have some evil, sick, twisted way of killing them then, right? Wrong. They just stab them. That's it. Not really frightening. I laughed more than I jumped. Also, the very predictability of it nearly drove me insane. Give me something unexpected, something crazy, way out there. She's going to open the curtains, oh i wonder who's gonna be standing there! The viewer knows from the very moment she glances at that window that one of the killers will be standing there. The same could be said for the total lack of communication devices. Oh, i wonder where my cell phone went...they took it duh! And also when the guy kills his friend. The viewer knows whats gonna happen as soon as his buddy walks in the house. The only somewhat creepy element in the entire film is the old record player playing music at the most inopportune moments. It could've been played a little less though, because it was extremely loud which became slightly annoying as the film progressed. All in all, it was less than amazing for me.

602,bryan-banowetz,Scariest I Have Seen in a While,9,1 July 2011,"""The Strangers"" follows James Hoyt and Kristen McKay as they are tortured by masked unknowns in the Hoyt family summer house. This movie toys with with a seemingly innocent idea: the home. It is through this movie that we realize that it is a distant dream to go to sleep at night with the doors unlocked. It is just impossible to believe that we are safe that way. There are people out there who will harm others just to harm them. This movie was a great horror/suspense film. One of the best I have seen in quite a while. It combines great horror aspects such as endangered love, senseless torture, an isolated location and the innocent home. Bryan Bertino did a fabulous job combining these elements into a believable and logical film sequence. He also did a great job in getting the viewer emotionally attached to the characters. You really felt what they were going through.The first, oh, 20 minutes of the movie were just really awkward. The two lovebirds come to the man's summer house and act really strange around each other. We find out that the man proposed to his lady earlier in the night and she rejected. This creates a great atmosphere of awkwardness and confusion of what to do. The couple just didn't know how to act and it really got the viewer's guard down. The first moment in the movie where you know that something is up is when the strange girl knocks on the door and asks, ""Is Tamara home?"" Whoa...that freaked me out a little. There is a shadowed girl at the door in the middle of the night. I got a few goosebumps. It is here that the viewer knows something is up.Kristen wants some cigarettes and James wants to go get them so he can drive around a bit, after his evening kind of went out of control. As Kristen is home by herself, getting a glass of water, we see a masked man looking at her in the background and then walk back into the dark. That was one of the scariest moments in the movie. Also one of the most intelligent and award-worthy moments. I saw this movie in the theater and everybody discovered the man at their own time. I was just in awe at how smart that scene was. It didn't have some guy just running out with a knife. The dramatic irony was a great element of surprise and horror. The audience now knows that these people are in the house. But, the characters don't. I thought this was very clever. So to make a long story short, this couple is tortured by these masked people the rest of the night until they are stabbed in the stomach the next morning. That was the only gore in the movie and I was happy that Bertino didn't need to result to blood all over the house to make it scary. What was even scarier still was one of the last lines of the film when Kristen screamed, ""Why are you doing this to us?"" Pin-Up Girl responds, ""Because you were home."" Probably one of the freakiest lines in horror movie history. It is such a creepy reason why these strangers are torturing these innocent people. It made the movie feel real and could really happen to just about anybody.Overall, the plot line was great (a bit slow at times, but great). The camera work was fabulous. The actors did a great job with the awkwardness at the beginning and had the viewers eating out of the palms of their hands. I really enjoyed the sense of unknown at the end. A lot of people complain that they should have revealed the masked people and that it was stupid not to reveal them. It made for a great mystery and kept questions in your head. That made it all the more scarier. I was surprised to read all of the negative reviews about this film. I felt that it was a truly remarkable work of horror. Of course, there were several horror clichés, but every other movie uses them and we don't seem to complain about them then. In conclusion, if you are stuck on where to go in the horror genre, I would reach for this one. It is a very unique movie in itself and has a lot to offer. It is one of the scariest movies I have seen in a while, but it is one of my most favorite horror movies. I definitely double checked the deadbolts that night.",The Strangers
603,bmactennis,Not a big fan of the horror genre...,4,28 October 2010,"...but since it's Halloween there are the usual plethora of these type movies out there. For some odd reason, this movie's fX channel promotionals intrigued me to the point where I made a mental note to watch this particular one. So I'm sitting around today and this movie just happens to come on. I'm like, ""cool, let's check this out"". Interesting premise to the movie as home invasions are indeed scary. I gotta say the execution of the premise was poor (no pun intended). At some point, as the screen writer, you've got to look at your work and ask yourself a series of questions. Is the plot plausible? Are the characters believable? What would average people do in similar circumstances? Is it too cliché'd? Etc, etc. For me, if you don't answer these questions then there's a good chance you're going to throw my aesthetic balance out-of-whack. About half-way through, the ol' mind started to separate from the movie. For instance: A) Animal heads all over the house, James' ol' man is a hunter, and the only friggin' gun is a disassembled shotgun on top of a book cabinet??? And then you just happen to find a billion shotgun shells stuffed in shoes boxes in a bedroom closet???!!! Sorry, kids, but that's not how hunters keep their weapons and ammo. B) OK, you two, you have a gun, you have tons of shells. I'd be firing that bad boy right away to let my assailants know that I'm armed and ready. I certainly would have cranked a couple of rounds into that masked guy as he was hacking through that front door. No, you futily hurl a chair at the door prior to firing a round. Of course, masked dude escapes unscathed. By the way, did Mr. Masked Man really have to chop his way through that 3-inch thick door? Didn't they find some way into the house already??? Perhaps, a window would provide easier access??? C.) The boyfriend's (James) friend (Mike?) comes over. A rock is hurled through the dude's windshield seemingly from straight ahead based on the trajectory, yet he sees nothing. All kinds of signs of foul play at hand, yet he fails to call 911, enters the house after seeing his friend's destroyed car in the driveway, doesn't turn the record player off, and fails to call out to see if his friends are there. You knew he was going to get blown away as he failed to look around, eyes fixed straight ahead to one particular door because why? D)How about the boyfriend making the decision to go out alone and get help leaving her in the house? OK, so unless you've got a nice insurance policy on the Mrs., no sane person would leave their better half alone in that house. Even an idiot would leave her the gun, AT LEAST! E) What's her name goes outside without shoes on, doesn't bring that big-ass knife as a weapon, and leaves all the doors open to the house. OK, great, why go in the house after then? You know the bad people are going to be in there. I'd take my chances out in the woods in the dark vs hiding in a kitchen pantry. F.) Any particular reason why the masked people would change the gf into a dress (night gown?) prior to tying her up? Did I miss something? BF still had his suit on, though they did have to put his jacket on. G.) Killers, did you get bored??? You take off your masks and then plunge knives into their guts after terrorizing them for hours??? What, no torture??? Thankfully, I didn't waste ten buck-a-roos at the theater a couple of years ago. This could have been a better movie if the screen writing was sharper. Not sure if I'm going to acquaint myself with Strangers II.",The Strangers
604,badnewsjones,"No Plot, Artificial Tension Leaves This One a Yawner",3,10 June 2008,"Horror movie fans who are sick of gore-fests may be tricked into thinking that this movie will be a breath of fresh air. While this movie does make a return to suspense over graphic violence, the whole experience is extremely shallow and predictable.The fist and more obvious issue is the lack of any real plot. But, hey, it's a slasher, so most people will be able to get over this one. Two people get assaulted while home alone in the middle of nowhere. It's not original, but it's worked before.Since there's no plot, the film has to rely on its use of suspense to make it interesting. Unfortunately, this is where the movie really falls flat. The director's methods of building suspense are extremely obvious and overbearing. Again, this might not be so bad, except that the point of suspense is to keep building and building until a single moment, preferably the climax. In ""The Strangers,"" the suspense is broken about 50 times during the movie. Early on, there are a few ""false scare"" where you don't see the killers and two good moments when you do. After that however, I was tired of seeing these ""pop-out"" scares. They became very predictable, and because you could see them coming, the movie couldn't build up suspense anymore.Bottom line, this movie isn't really that scary. It tries (very hard) to be scary, but it's just too predictable and repetitive. If there's any bright spot in this one, it's that the acting isn't horrible.If you're looking for a good horror movie that uses suspense well, you can't go wrong with The Changeling, The Shining, Alien (if you like the sci-fi bent), the original Halloween.",The Strangers

You don't. You're only annoyed that nothing is happening and you're finding things out in dribs and drabs.Then the night of terror begins, to which you get no satisfying ending. It's just over, and you're wondering two things. The first is ""why did these people do what they did?"" and the second is ""why did I just waste ten bucks to see this thing?"" If you're thinking of seeing this, you'll probably have a better time just burning the $10. Or better yet, buy a DVD of ""The Others"" which is much more satisfying.",The Strangers

Not only is the storyline weak and unbelievabl4, but it's also boring. This movie compelled me to register just so I could comment on how bad it was. The reason I feel this movie to be a stinker is because of it's nature and intention. Its basic principles rely on realism for emotional effect and the story is just not realistic. The killers are so random that even killers probably can't relate and the protagonists are mindless drones, walking to the slaughter. Every scene is predictable and unrealistic and every character is unrelatable. There is no need to go into particulars because the movie is just all bad. This from a guy who likes the Evil Dead, Nightmare on Elm Street and House series. At least those directors knew what kind of film they were making.",The Strangers

It delivers exactly what it promises: an hour and a half of thrills. It wasn't made to win any Emmy's, it was made to entertain and scare people, and thats exactly what it did. It was well-written and well delivered. It doesn't focus on the unnecessary; why Liv Tyler's character said 'no' to the proposal doesn't effect the plot so it wasn't explained, and why the strangers are doing this isn't explained because it didn't have to be (they are after all deranged, isn't that enough?).If you didn't like this movie, than you're thinking too much into it.

I didn't think it endeared you too much with the characters.If you're going for the suspense factor, I think you'll enjoy it. You feel like something/someone could jump out at any moment.

610,bshelto1,Disappointing because it had so much potential,5,5 May 2010,"The Strangers had so much potential. The first half hour or so built an enormous amount of suspense through the use of sounds and music. The sense of dread was great. Then I began to realize that our protagonists had no chance against the seemingly supernatural - or at least superhuman - antagonists, who could appear and disappear in an instant. They could always predict what the couple would do next. Drained of the ""what will happen next"" factor, it becomes an exercise in cruelty and violence. There is no question where the movie is going. I am not opposed to bleak endings, but this one seemed completely unearned. I had hoped for so much more.",The Strangers
611,dead_donnie,Almost less boring than staring at a blank wall,4,1 June 2008,"As everyone probably anticipated, this film is another in a seemingly endless string of unbearable formulaic pap that Hollywood has been spewing out for the past nine billion years. This film wasn't exactly horrible, and I admit I was hoping against all reason that it might succeed at least a tiny bit in creating an eerie mood and generating some genuine scares, but no, that's just too much to ask for. Without going in to too much detail, I can tell you that the first 30 minutes or so are sort of creepy, but the rest is nothing but cheap, unnecessarily noisy scares and way too many glimpses of these totally unintimidating people in stupid looking masks. And yes, as the previews implied, the movie really does revolve entirely around the gimmick that these people are wearing scary looking masks. And that's it. The highlight of the movie, for me, was the ""hey that's the dude from It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia!"" part. So if you like watching Liv Tyler's upper lip continue to be bigger than her lower lip and people in stupid masks walking around banging on things, this is the movie for you. Oh, and it's completely anti-climactic as well. A true Hollywood gem.",The Strangers

I don't think I'll ever rent a cabin in the woods ever again. The beginning was good. There were suspense and shock elements and even the middle had a pretty slow, but decent climax. However, the ending definitely leaves you disappointed and asking yourself ""why"". As in, ""why did I spend 8 dollars to see this?"". There are some twists and turns but the beginning basically gives away the ending. And after that you would hope it would at least be a thrilling joy ride until you reach that point. But it wasn't. The movie was only an hour and a half long but it felt like it was drawn out. You will jump at parts. The music will creep you out. You will generally be scared leaving the theater.

Before I continue, I want to say that the only reason I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 is because it's at least entertaining enough to laugh at. Some movies are so bad and boring that you can't even watch them to make fun of them, but my husband and I did watch the whole movie and laughed through it together.*SPOILERS AHEAD*I've seen so many horror movies, and never in my life have I seen a woman as stupid as Liv Tyler's character. The only things she did that actually made sense were changing into more practical clothes (except she didn't put on shoes, so she loses half a point for that) and grabbing a knife (which she loses almost immediately and never replaces until the very end of the film). She runs outside without shoes and trips and falls, never has a weapon in her hands, is constantly standing around in the middle of the giant living room rather than finding anywhere to hide, and literally runs into/makes noise with basically anything she could possibly run into or make noise with. At one point, after making tons of noise in the shed, she comes back into the house and runs into the table, spreading her hands across the silverware on the top of the table, making even more noise. Then she proceeds to walk into the hallway, leaning against the wall as she walks. I told my husband ""I bet she's gonna knock that picture frame off the wall, because she has to make noise everywhere she goes."" And guess what happened next... picture frame falls off the wall and breaks on the ground. Honestly, if I hadn't known better I would think this was a spoof movie with how ridiculously stupid this girl was. She pretty much did every cliché, idiotic thing she possibly could have, and her boyfriend wasn't much better.Overall, the whole movie was incredibly cliché and predictable. It was scary for a bit, but after a while I was too busy laughing and trying to guess what stupid thing she was going to do next to bother being scared by the masked people.",The Strangers
615,horrorhound85,Brian Bertino shows Eli Roth what horror really is,10,5 October 2008,"I have to say i have seen a LOT of horror movies in my time and i've always found that the best ones are the ones that create tension, drama and make you really care about the characters. True horror films are those that scare you witless and not just a gore-fest ie SAW, Hostel. Don't get me wrong i enjoy these films but the ones with real empathy and tension such as the grudge are without doubt the best. The first thing that comes on screen are the words ""based on true events"" i sighed and though oh great another Wolf Creek or Last house on the left. LHOTL says its based on true events but its complete hocum . Anyway. The film starts off slow building up a relationship between Kristen and James our two protagonists. They have just returned from a friends wedding where James has proposed to kristen who turned him down. They are not really on speaking terms and you already feel like you know them. They stay up for a while and end up making love in the kitchen. This is where things start to take a sinister turn as there is a loud knock on the door. From here the viewer is taken on a roller-coaster ride of pure terror that you just don't want to end. One of the most iconic moments is where, James having gone for help as three Strangers try to enter their home, Kristen is left alone in the house. Standing in the kitchen she puffs on a cigarette unaware of the Stranger (sack man) standing in the doorway. Everyone in the cinema jumped and many screamed. OK i know this was lifted from various horrors such as Halloween but it is so well done and you as the viewer almost feel you are in the house with them. It has been a very long time since a horror film has made my heart leap to my throat but this really did. It is so effective. I can't understand why it has had such bad reviews. There are some very clever things as well in this film that i did not see coming and others that even though i saw coming i still jumped out of my skin.

BAD WRITING is ultimately BAD WRITING. resulting a massive pile of FAIL. No amount of dressing that up will change this. There are so many pathetic holes in this film which i will elaborate on in a second, but I really do feel cheated after the quite gripping and tense atmosphere that was initially built up during the first 20 minutes of this ""cult film"". In that situation, a situation where potentially you are about to be killed/hurt/chased etc. would you - the reader of this post - constantly make it your goal to leave the woman you ""love"" in the house on her own. While you run off and around trying to get help and generally do nothing. This happened the first time and I was like ""If you leave the house with your love in it BY HERSELF I will deduct a point from my opinion of this film: So he does it..... Then... Guess what,,,, He does it again.... and what happens? Well done man. Leave your girl on her own in the house, distraught, with a bleeding hand. Instead of what... Take her with you?! : Fail Next Liv Tyler, Great actor, usually, beautiful girl. Thrust into this pathetic role. When there are people trying to kill/hurt/chase/potentially rape you, why do you make it your absolute goal to MAKE AS MUCH NOISE AS POSSIBLE, Constantly. Throwing yourself around the house, smashing plates, banging into cupboards and generally making loud bangs is asking for death. In the most stupid way ever. Fail. Crawl down the middle of the front lawn towards the house, in the wide open, regardless to the fact that there is some kind of pillow headed man (Friday 13th/Michael Myers) Banging some sticks and clanging metal pipes together outside your house? Fail. And then, just when I thought please God give me a decent resolution. So this film is worth while.... ""It will be easier next time!"" Yes of course it would you mask wearing redneck, maybe you will decide to actually kill the people first. Instead of wasting so much time smashing the place up like amateurs and leaving about a million pieces of evidence for the police to find strewn all over the property. ""Cult"" :( Fail. Sequel?

If you're an ADD movie watcher you won't like it. The subtlety will make you mad scared. Amazing acting! The reactions felt like how anyone would react.
By the time the end came it felt like I was the one there. I couldn't sleep, which has never happened from a movie. The next morning I couldn't stop thinking about it. That day 2 strange women came knocking on my door and completely freaked me out. I would tell people that I just saw the scariest movie ever and then not want to tell them the title because I didn't want them to feel the fear I did. I literally can't bring myself to watch it again and thinking about it makes me cringe. I never expected the ending to happen the way it did. No other movie has made me feel the way this one did. Bravo!!👏
Also, make sure you watch it in the dark and don't get up. (The movie isn't long, so you can wait to go to the bathroom) Make sure the volume is turned up.

621,Brittks,"Very Real, Very Scary",8,10 June 2008,"The Strangers key to advertising was how adamant it was about being a true story. As a means to quiet the skeptics, this movie is based on actual events. The names and dates used in the film are fictional but the story is based on a combination of a family terrorized in their cabin in the woods, and eventually slaughtered to death. The second aspect of the story comes from a compilation of events from Helter Skelter, and the Manson family killings in the 1960s.I saw the The Strangers on June 4, and it is a scary movie that has all of the makings of run of the mill horror movies. The music used for sound effects is timed stunningly to build suspense; much of the film is shot in very low-key lighting, and there is little overall to keep the audience's suspense building. I know many moviegoers find the lack of action to be boring, but I found that it did a great job of building the suspense, and it really brought the audience into the story and made you feel like you were part of the terror.As far as the acting goes, the cast was bleak, so the actors that they had needed to stand out. Liv Tyler, who plays the main character, was outstanding. She carried the movie and gave a performance to make what might have been a mediocre film very scary. She was very believable, and I empathized with her very real portrayal of fear. The cast had five principle characters (the young couple, and three stalkers), three supporting characters, and a handful of atmosphere extras.The unidentified sixth main character was an old-fashioned 45 record player that was used by the stalkers to frighten the couple. The record player took on a character of its own and symbolized upcoming danger.Overall, from a story point of view, the director managed to take a seemingly simple story, which could have been told in probably ten minutes, and extended it to feature length while maintaining suspense the whole time. The movie appeared low budget, (actually only cost $9 Million), but made great use of what it had to work with. Aesthetically there was nothing visually special about it, but it was not poorly shot either. Finally, I think the sound really made the film what it is. The sound effects and music made the movie frightening and maintained a high level of suspense throughout.I was very pleased, and scared while watching it alone, throughout the movie. With an estimated 926 shots, the action was fairly fast paced but slow where it needed to be. After leaving the theater I heard some people talking about being scared, while others were just quiet, and a few spoke about how bad they perceived it to be, with one man stating as he left, ""that's the biggest piece of crap I've ever seen in my life, I mean really!"" Even though the ending is very cliché and ""Hollywood"", f you're into scary movies and aren't afraid about something like this really happening, I highly recommend it. 8/10.",The Strangers

Let's see if we can just make up the most ridiculous things that might have happened to them that night! It'll be fun!!Screw this. This movie along with Wolf Creek can bite me.This new genre of movies that are 'BASED on actual events' is killing me. I had a friend who is pretty 'dark' as they say. Not Gothic. Not emo. He's into horror films and the like. He appreciates a good scare, and when he saw this, he told me it effed him up. He jumped so many times during this film, his words, that he felt like he had switched genders. Could NOT stop thinking about it for weeks.I am no longer friends with this guy. I just watched this movie last night with a girl (it's true, she kinda likes me), and besides not finding a single part that scared me, I could only find a couple of things that actually happened to this poor idiot couple that got killed by a trio of bored teens.The couple left a wedding and went to a house where dramatic B.S. ensues. B.S. being their sub plot of her apparently saying no to his marriage proposal, but that was left so vague we might as well assume that she couldn't marry him because: A. She is dying of something. Could be stupidity. B. She hates attractive men. C. She only marries men who can handle a situation where a gun needs to be loaded...I went with all 3 since thats the only thing that makes sense for me.So they get attacked, don't make good decisions while facing angst filled younger folks, and they get stabbed to death. I'm fine with that. Horrible thing to happen to such decent people. My problem is filling the last, unknown hours they shared together with Hollywood crap that people these days just eat up.Did they split up? Did she cry a lot? Did SCOTT SPEEDMAN get overpowered by some skinny guy in a poor mans Scarecrow mask while holding a SHOTGUN?Who cares, let's pretend these people were idiots and that's why they died. It'll be fun.Just like in Wolf Creek, the entire film was some rich guys fantasy about what happened to these people in the unexplained time between point A and point B.The entire film was one girl all like ""let's save our friend!"" and the other one's like ""no, let's go! omg!"" And they get ruined and killed in such horrible ways it's not even funny.Then the guy wakes up and goes to get help and they never find anything THE END.I call B.S. I say that guy killed those 2 girls and was weird enough that he tortured himself so convincingly that the authorities were all ""geeze, poor guy"" and then he led them someplace else to find nothing.Getting back to The Strangers...

Plenty of scenes I was trying to figure out which movie I'd seen it in instead of being scared. It just didn't make much sense either. Within what seemed like 30 min the main character went from drinking champagne, to drinking a beer, to drinking water. From going to bed to getting dressed. She said she broke her leg/foot when she fell in the woods to pretty much walking ten minutes later. There wasn't a scare in this movie I haven't seen a zillion times. The actors were fine but the dialog was terrible...I was about ready to shut it off after the first 20 min.This barely passes my ""fun waste of 90min of my life test"". And trust me I'm not that picky when it comes to terror/horror.If there was anything that struck me as really good was the sound....all the banging and echoing was pretty cool and added to ""isolation"" of the characters.",The Strangers

I was skeptical, so I decided to go and see it for myself, with my wife of course. I saw this movie thinking that it will be like any other horror movie that has been coming out lately. What I got was a very surprising and scary movie. I tend not to watch scary movies because they are too fake. This movie really scared me for two reasons, I live in the same type of residence as the couple (house out in the country and neighbors to far from me), and the sound effects really made the movie a lot more intense with the quietness and all of a sudden you hear a loud bang that scare's the sh*& out of you.

625,georgetzeson,THE WORST MOVIE IN THE WORLD,1,16 February 2021,DONT SEE THIS MOVIE YOU WILL JUST WASTE YOUR PRECIOUS TIME. DON'T EVEN WATCH EVEN IF THEY PAY YOU TO DO SO,The Strangers
626,katycharlotte-1,I loved this film!,10,2 April 2014,"'The Strangers' is the disturbing chilling film debut for director Bryan Bertino about a home invasion, loosely based upon the Manson Family's murder of Sharon Tate, and possibly inspired by the French film 'Them'. While this film does not break any new ground regarding it's story, the fascinating use of music, imagery and camera work allows a menacing atmosphere of paranoia and claustrophobia to build up throughout the film, eventually reaching its shocking climax. The film begins by introducing us to James Hoyt (Scott Speedman) and his partner Kristen McCay (Liv Tyler). Their evening is not off to a good start, when James makes a marriage proposal to Kristen and she rejects him. However it gets much worse when a masked young woman knocks on the door. This is the beginning of a series of disturbances that start out as annoying and a little eerie but soon develop into something far more threatening which leads you to question Just how safe are you in your own home? The Strangers are Dollface (Gemma Ward), Man In The Mask (Kip Weeks) and Pin-Up Girl (Laura Margolis) and they all wear masks throughout the film. The blank anonymity this gives these characters is one of the most unnerving aspects of 'The Strangers' as it dehumanizes them implying that they can't be reasoned with, also coupled with the fact that only Dollface speaks for the majority of the film and even she only has about five lines in total most of which can be seen in the film trailer.There is a range of techniques that Bertino uses to frighten his audience. Every camera shot in 'The Strangers' has a specific purpose in mind to disconcert the viewer. He frequently shoots from the character's point of view and he allows the audience to see things the characters don't. We know that The Strangers are in the house long before the characters realise it. A particularly unnerving scene when Kristen is standing in the kitchen completely oblivious to Man In The Mask standing watching her from the corner of the room. The Strangers also seem to possess the ability to appear and disappear soundlessly, therefore adding to the idea that they are not quite human. For me personally, the scariest aspect of The Strangers is that they have no apparent motives, personalities or anything else that would make them human. Kristen asks ""Why are you doing this to us?"" and Dollface replies simply ""Because you were home."" The Strangers do not respond to pleas or emotions. They cannot be reasoned with. It's pure nihilism. They kill because they find control and domination powerful, and they don't care about consequences, moral or of any other kind. At the end of the film when they finally kill James and Kristen, they remove their masks and we are reminded that we are not dealing with the supernatural, but real human beings who have chosen the path of evil and can't be convinced otherwise. This film is genuinely chilling, however it focuses more on psychological torture rather than physical and may therefore let down less sophisticated horror fans. However for those who appreciate more subtle horror, 'The Strangers' will definitely not disappoint.",The Strangers
627,ambewick,Still waiting for something to happen,1,29 August 2008,"Sometimes there are movies where you wait, and wait and wait, get bored become restless, start saying in your head 'come on, get on with it this is becoming REALLY tedious', but you just know your patience will be rewarded with a killer twist, a shocking ending, or at least something that makes it worth spending your seven quid on. Well this ain't it. It starts with two characters you care nothing about, adds another, employs three jobbing actors in some plastic masks and a sack, and then creates some loud soundtrack bangs to make the audience jump. Its as if the director has said' I can't do this again as its been done so many times before but hey, I might just make a buck if its marketed properly!' It goes on and on, and if I had to watch Liv Tyler run, hop or try to escape one more time from a non scary 'killer',I would lose the will to live. Every standard scare tactic ever employed in a movie turns up here, so you try to forgive that by thinking it must get better, good twist coming, but you know what, it does'nt. At the end I said to my missus, 'If this movie finishes like this, its the worst movie I have ever sat through' - then it finished, with another ancient shock tactic (think Carrie but 100 times less effective)as the final fright. No plot, no direction, no twist, just a plodding 90 minutes of boredom, which fizzles out like you would dare it not to. Avoid and all costs - this is tripe with a big fat capital T.",The Strangers

And to be honest, that's saying something, because usually when I go to see a self-proclaimed ""scary-movie"", I either find it funny or boring. The Strangers, however, surprised me to put it mildly, I liked that the faces of the assailants weren't shown and that their motives weren't revealed, as it made the film even scarier. Another thing that surprised me about this film was that the acting had been very well directed and carried out so that the characters are natural in their actions, making the events all the more real. I can honestly say that a film has never scared me like The Strangers did. When I came home from the cinema I was so paranoid that I checked round corners and slept with my phone in my hand! I've never known a cinema audience to react as openly to a scary movie as the audience I was part of did, many people gasped and the tension could be felt throughout, it was a very strange, collective fear that often made me laugh out loud just to try and break the tension.I would certainly recommend this film to anyone who thinks that they're immune to scary movies, as I now know that I'm not!",The Strangers

This movie scared the Ho Ha out of me and my wife.If you are in the mood for a truly classic thriller with an edge of ""scared witless"" go see this movie ...

In both films, a couple is stalked by anonymous (hooded/masked) attackers in a rural house, in both films the villains turn out to be bored kids and both are based on a true story. While I thought Strangers was more frightening and much more ingenious, there is no shame giving credit where credit is due -- and by this I mean admitting that it was based on it's French predecessor ""Them"": http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0465203/ I think in general, American audiences have much to discover from French horror and American filmmakers have much to learn from them as well.",The Strangers

That's where the +5 comes in. The plot, well, there really was not a plot. Three killers terrorize and kill a couple in the middle of no where that's where the +0 comes in. This horror film ended just as every other horror movie now a days does. Evil triumphs, and the protagonists of the story... die. It's tired, it's unoriginal, and it has removed ALL hope in me that there can be a suspenseful horror movie where SOMEONE struggles and overcomes (instead of having the illusion that the killers are supernatural). Most of the time the killers did not even have weapons.... completely open to attack and the main characters did nothing! NOTHING! Unrealistic. I thought that the scenes where the killers would be in the background were creepy, but the only time it was creepy was the first time the killers were revealed. Throughout the WHOLE movie they kept revealing them over and over again in that way.... it got old.

This movie does contain violence, but it was in the taste of older horror films where it does not gush blood or exaggerates it in any manner. This movie was actually about suspense, and it had you jumping and screaming from surprise and suspense. Though the plot line is a tad fuzzy, it is much in the style of Hitchcock, and it will entertain the young and the old. The actual spoken lines are few, but they are chilling when spoken. The facial reactions and musical score increase the suspense. Kudos to Liv Tyler on her performance which ultimately made the movie a success in my mind.",The Strangers

638,bellej1,"not a masterpiece, but nowhere near terrible",7,4 June 2008,"this film was not bad at all. not great mind you but not awful like I've heard some people say. the film is shot very well with a dark overtone which i really enjoyed. it gets you to like and sympathize with these characters. the audience is shown a couple who are already having a bad evening.then comes a knock on the door from a mysterious girl looking for a ""tamara"" who clearly doesn't live there.from there we watch as these characters go from being harassed by these disturbing strangers lurking outside their house to them being terrorized and victimized by these sadistic masked people.the whole movie after the first knock on the door is suspenseful and makes you feel anxious until the dismal end of the movie. the whole time you feel the helplessness of these characters their vehicles have been destroyed, they have no way of calling the police, and they are injured so they really cant run. i think the worse part about the film is they make simple horror movie mistakes such as not running the hell out of there people complain it doesn't have a resolution, it does too! its just not a happy one like every other movie where the good guys overcome ridiculous odds like defeating a chainsaw wielding retard who feels no pain or an escaped mental patient looking to kill his sister who also feels no pain and live happily ever after. i give it a 6.5 to a 7 because of the anxiety it produces and the unlikely movie ending which unfortunately is all too much like what usually happens in real life situations similar to this such as the Manson family killing Sharon Tate. give the movie a try its not bad. don't go to this thing expecting a tarentino or a Scorsese film, and don't go if your a little girl who cant handle some realism.",The Strangers

I was also pretty creeped out alone at 130 in the morning, the masks were creepy, the whole vibe.. then it just went downhill.---spoilers within---- positives: good acting, good blood effects, i like the fact that you never see them even after the masks are off the way they did that was cool (albeit frustrating cos it makes you so curious) negatives:as another review said why did they take so long to kill them? The cat and mouse thing got reaaaaal old. I got the feeling right before she hides in the closet that mask guy knew she was around and was just like whatever. And when she is crawling outside and you see the lady following her until liv turns around then she is gone.. how is that even supposed to scare the character? she didn't know mask lady was behind her! I feel like the scary weird crap should have ended about 10 minutes after James returns home. like, stuff is written on the wall and his phone is inside, friend gets shot, oo more stuff newly written on window some running around BAM they should have been kidnapped. I was seriously hoping they would get taken just so they could have a sit down with the killers. In fact, I don't know why it took them SO long to ask ""why are you doing this!"" after all the staring at each other from across the way then running I feel like someone should have been like ""stop screwing with us already just do something.""

640,baga9386-1,"C, but shows promise.",5,2 February 2009,"I thought the acting and all of the technical elements were there and solid, but I couldn't stand the writing. After reading up on the story and some reviews, I had really low expectations. For a first time director and writer, this wasn't all that bad, but those were the areas that suffered the most.Nothing new in the direction, but very well executed standard suspense/thriller stuff: double fakes and creepiness. The writing was kinda lame, though. I kept having to find ways to care about these characters through their repeatedly stupid acts and clichés. The friend that gets his head shot that never called out to Scott and Liv and should have noticed the eerie absence of the record player, the fact that neither lead looks for a cell phone on him after he dies, the choice made to stay even though they knew the house was no longer safe (There's a road with lights in front of the house! Run for it with the gun and shoot people that come near with masks on!, and they broke the oldest rule in the book: ""Never separate!"" Then the ending doesn't really know what it's trying to say. ""Love fights until the end, but still loses to random violence,"" was a pitch title I heard somebody say, but there is no such thing as a random act. Even if these people were picked randomly, a plan was obviously in place. What to do if they have a gun: fall back and wait. What if they have a car: ram it with the truck. It just seemed so needlessly nihilistic, unless this is just a morality tale about not being dumb.I know most of this seems harsh, but this was still a better suspense/thriller movie than most that have come out since the Grudge and Ring explosion. Again, good work for a first time director. If he can improve he will be able to make a name, but he needs to get more creative all around, not just use classic stand-bys.",The Strangers

Why must people always need an answer. A lot of things in life don't have answers but thats what makes it more interesting.I love thrillers and horror films and I have to say that The Strangers is up there with some of my favorites. It wasn't really gory which made it an even better scary movie for me. At some points there was scare after scare and even in the last 2 seconds of the movie I was scared out of my seat. I loved it and would definitely recommend it to anyone who likes scary movies who don't mind having some mystery behind it once the screen goes black.P.S. To the one comment that said, that there were a lot of things unsolved. In the beginning of the movie it says that a lot of the real life events that took place are still unknown.

The only problem is that the movie wasn't scary. Actually, there were many more problems. I'll list the ones I noticed: 1. What was the point of the 911 call at the beginning? The voice was a woman's voice but the people who found the bodies were two young boys.2. These events were inspired by true events. That is a sack of sh**. If I go fishing and see a whale, then write Moby Dick, I can say the book was inspired by true events.3. Why the whole marriage proposal storyline? Did it add anything to the movie? 4. Why didn't the two victims just run down the road to get away? 5. The two victims constantly try and hide from the Strangers. Inevitably, one of the strangers looks, gives up and walks away. The audience is supposed to believe they victims are safe then....WHAMMO...a stranger pops out.6. What was the point of the trips to the barn? To use a radio and call for help? This is a horror movie cliché.7. The two victims keep splitting up and saying ""Stay There! Hide!"" Meanwhile, the strangers are busy writing horrifying messages in lipstick or blood all over the walls.8. The ending is just insane. No point at all.

I've not got a problem with watching a bad film, but only when either it knows itll be bad, i know itll be bad, and/or they don't try to be realistic and pawn it of as such. this is utter nonsense and in keeping with most modern day 'horror' films. a few cheap frights doesn't make a scary film.on the plus side, i feel much better. thanks for listening.",The Strangers

Its unbelievable suspense created by stunning non-verbal acting creates tension and fear felt in few other horror flicks today. And instead of blood and gore, ""The Strangers"" uses sheer terror to create a realistic impact that will have you double-checking your door and window locks.

653,circuitdump-1,'Inspired' not 'Based' - Learn this before viewing. First Review.,4,1 June 2008,"First off, let's start with a note. It was 'inspired' not 'based' off true events. People need to learn the difference between the two. The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is 'inspired' by true events, but still people believe it really happened. It never happened... it was inspired by the story of the serial killer Ed Gein who would take body parts off of women and make furniture out of them, and other forms of cruelty.The Strangers was 'inspired' by true events which means they probably took similarities from stories of The Manson killings and other killings of the same sort. So really the director had free range to do whatever the hell he wanted at the end, and I believe he failed.I heard about this movie a long time ago and was so excited that it was finally being released that I saw it at the first midnight showing. At first, I was enjoying the set, costumes, and I believe the acting was pretty well done. I believe the director achieved a very creepy feeling, but too many times did he use to obvious cop-out of making loud noises to 'startle' the viewer instead of genuinely 'scaring' them. The site bloody-disgusting.com made an excellent article describing the differences between these.In the end, I remember about two scenes and the rest is a vague blur. The scene with Glenn Howerton (of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia! fame. Woot!) was probably one of the most tense and unsettling scenes of the film. The other being the portion where the record is skipping.This movie is a strong example of anti-climactic. The ending was a cliché. I won't give it away but I will say that it did not leave me feeling disturbed nor did it leave me with a sense of accomplishment. Two things I look for in an ending to the flood of ""home-invasion"" horror flicks. I believe two recent films do a great job of accomplishing these factors. The recent VACANCY and FUNNY GAMES are leaps and bounds greater than this film. They do a much greater job of making the protagonists feel helpless and I strongly suggest both of them.Hopefully, I could help some. I know many will disagree with me, but quite honestly that's fine. Many of today's moviegoers enjoy paying $10 to jump out of their seat because someone's face appears in a window or a sound guy hits a wall really loud. It's the sad truth and Hollywood banks on crap like that. So it isn't going to end anytime soon.Thanks, Alex",The Strangers
654,yanksfan4202003,Terrible,1,5 June 2008,"The movie was straight up terrible. It was incredibly boring and unoriginal. On top of that the acting was unrealistic and terribly dry. The script was just as bad, being terribly lame and unreal...people just wouldn't say things like they did or act in those ways given the circumstances!! The whole movie is just the two main characters running around in circles, crawling across clearly lit fields, being chased by masked murderers, except there are 3 murderers and they are on a small plot of land. They also bring up things and then never develop them throughout the movie. In the middle of all this, i found my mind wandering all over the place because it was just that uninteresting.

655,adrenaline144,A HUGE waste of time,2,6 June 2008,"Movies like this one are pointless unless your the kind of person that goes to the movies just to see people kill other people... There is almost no plot. I'll admit there were a few parts that I would consider ""horror and suspense"", but not many, and they didn't lead anywhere anyway. The entire movie is just somebody running and hiding, then being found, screaming, and running and hiding again, the ENTIRE movie. The movie never gives you a clue as to why the masked strangers were killing these people, and there is no ending. The two people die, without really knowing why, and then two kids find them, and the girl that was stabbed over and over again is somehow still alive and she wakes up and screams... that's it. Seriously, if you like movies with at least a little bit of substance, this is definitely not worth your time or money. If you just want to see people play hide and seek and then die, I feel sorry for you.",The Strangers
656,nailgrl372,Horrible. Not horror.,4,31 May 2008,"This movie was definitely NOT one of the best horror movies ever made and its not up there with the classics in any way, shape, or form. It will be forgotten and left in a discount bin at walmart, at best. There are at least 50 or more different points in this movie where the Kristen (liv Tyler) and James (scott speedman) could've gotten away. What person is going to let a puny little 14 yr old girl overpower them when you could knock her out with one blow? Kristen just stands there and lets these 'killers' just sorta check her out, maybe sniff her a little, like some sort of dumb apes. And at the very end, whats the point of having masks on when you take them off before you kill them anyway?",The Strangers
657,Polop_Trone,Cut and Paste Horror,1,13 September 2010,"Another retched attempt at horror. Cliché, to say the least. Pointless, I got absolutely nothing out of it. The acting was fair, but it certainly doesn't make up for the lack of any quality writing, cinematography, or editing. Sound was a bad attempt that just became annoying. This script should go in the trash, I would have passed on this after 10 pages. A classic example of all character and no plot. I don't mean that in a ""2010 Clash of the Titans"" sense of the term ""no plot"" I mean it literally, in the ""teletubies"" sense of the term. May possibly be scary to someone who has never seen a film from the horror genre. Certainly not recommended for people who get furious about cut and paste film making.

This film had pour character development and even poorer over all plot. As a matter a fact, what is the plot, to take people's money and leave them feeling mad at the end of a film, which just ends? This wasn't even a first act, much less a complete story. There were no jumps, no scares, and no suspense. The only redeeming quality of this film is the extra time put into the sound department for this film. Of course the sound department had their work cut out for them, since they provided the only hint of any possible suspense, but that too was ruined by the lack of anything else.Waist of time!!!!",The Strangers
659,mullin216,Suspenseful to the end,8,30 May 2008,"I was torn going into this movie. It would either live up to the hype or be decent but eventually bog down. Well it lived up to the hype. I was hooked at the first banging of the door at 4 in the morning when a young woman asks for Tamara. Her face is covered by the darkness. The same woman returns again to really get the audience freaked out. A man appearing behind Liv Tyler in the house only added on. It was thrilling and terrifying at times. The middle part slows the movie up but the final act makes up for it. This is almost a throwback to the older horror movies where the psycho simply stands there or swings on a swing while staring at the victims. There isn't over the top villains, excessive gore, or violence in every scene. This movie just pulls you in and scares the hell out of you. The strangers enjoy the tormenting and their motives turn murderous toward the end. Why do it? Because the couple was home. The fact that it could happen to anyone makes it even more terrifying.",The Strangers
660,jonosmith14,What a god awful piece of cinema,1,2 September 2008,"Given the trailers that I saw on TV for this film, i'll be honest, i was excited to go and see it. The trailer portrays a sense of dread, violence and horror. All of which are totally lacking from the film.The film starts slow, and never picks up. Even when the killers are in full swing with their attacks on the couple, it still drags on slowly, with no real sense of panic or urgency about it.The killers are meant to be demented psychopaths who enjoy the pain and suffering of others, yet even when they are tormenting the couple you see no sense of them enjoying it. The film drags on and on and the violence is practically non-existent. A guy gets shot and there is suggestion of stabbings, but all you get to see as a viewer is leaves. Nothing actually happens, she just sits in her house crying.The only redeeming part of the film is its delightful soundtrack, which thankfully distracted me from what was going on on screen. Also the killers masks are good for a laugh every now and then.Overall, it would be best for you to avoid this film as nothing happens, and it fails at what it sets out to do. From the trailers i was expecting to be at least a little bit scared home alone, but here I am doing just fine. I would avoid this film,, and if you want to watch a better film about being alone in an isolated house, i suggest All the Boys Love Mandy Lane.",The Strangers

It's perfect in every way. The scares are well...actually SCARY. The acting to just perfect. The decisions the victims made were actually respectable.

If it hadn't happened, I would say they could have made it better. 90% of the movie was just the Strangers popping up and leaving, 8% was talking in the beginning, and 2% was gore. The guy accidentally shot his friend, and it showed his head where the bullet hit, and the second to last scene when they stabbed the couple. You basically have three choices. Go see it in the daytime by yourself, see it at night with a group, or hire a big dude to jump at you for a day. I saw it at night with one other friend, and I squeezed her hand to death. At most, you will probably only have a hard time getting to sleep, but you will be able to sleep. Definitely not worthy of an R rating though. Overall, if you like scary movies, see this one IN THEATERS if you want the full effect.

664,trickydick41,God Awful,1,10 June 2008,"One of the worst movies I have ever seen. For a ""scary movie"" it was bland, boring, and very predictable. The acting was poor, and there were parts that were just poorly edited. The best part of the movie is when the credits roll. And the scariest part is that i paid ten dollars to see it. My opinion is that is was way too boring, not enough gore or thrills to be considered a horror movie, and the ending was just plain dumb. This movie couldn't have been fixed with good actors, because the plot was terrible. My suggestion is to find a better ""true story"" to make a movie about or learn to embellish it a little more to suit the big screen. Trust me, this movie is not worth seeing.",The Strangers
665,justaneckert,One of the scariest movies I have EVER seen....,9,30 May 2008,"I honestly don't understand why the reviews for this film have been so bad. Granted, there wasn't much character development, and not much of a plot, but its a horror movie...and it does exactly what its supposed to do - truly horrify you. The tremendous amount of tension starts off right away with the awkwardness between the two main characters because of the rejected marriage proposal. When the creepers started popping up everywhere, I was scared sh*tless. The theatre was packed, and many people were screaming and jumping throughout the entire movie, and honestly, I was hiding behind my own hand during some parts. I LOVE horror films, but this one was so scary that part of me wanted to leave the theatre. Most horror movies use gradually building music and sound effects to ""trick"" you into thinking that something scary is going to happen, but then nothing happens at all. Or at least nothing scary. This tactic was also used in ""The Strangers"" and I thought to myself ""No, nothing bad is going to happen..."" but it did - over and over again. The only thing that I would have done differently is to change the ending. Liv Tyler's scream at the end of the movie definitely made me jump, but I feel like the film would've been better if the last scene was seeing the Mormon boys walk their bikes toward the country house and the truck with the masked killers drive away from the murders. For people who think that horror movies don't scare them, I definitely recommend this movie to prove them wrong.",The Strangers

Epic!No. Okay, I'll give it that it was a fantastic horror movie. I am a horror movie JUNKIE, and The Strangers was a fantastic horror movie. It needed no gore or anything like that to scare you and get you sweating, it was great for that, i'm ashamed to say that it actually scared me! It was fantastic, it was very very very scary. It was creepy if anything lol, like, is wasn't really the BAM in your face kinda thing, but the lurking in the background. Lol, it was a good horror movie overall, BUT the movie itself was HORRIBLE! There was no story line.It didn't explain to you WHY the three people in the masks were torturing theses people. Also, the end was pointless, the movie made no sense and the end didn't explain anything, it was stupid. It explained nothing and why did the liv tyler know the doll face girls name? It was a FANTASTIC horror movie, but a HORRIBLE movie. It had no plot. If someone would care to explain it to me that would be great! ALso, if all this happened in 2005 it would be an ongoing investigation so there wouldn't be movie about it so soon, and also because it was only 3 years ago i highly doubt the family would allow them to do this, and also, you think about it, the killers were never caught so i don't understand how someone would make a movie, they probably think they're being glorified.

There isn't a lot of blood and gore and the very brief sexual moment in one of the earlier scenes was in very good taste. (It wasn't in-your-face or crude at all.) It's amazing how such a simple plot with not many characters was so captivating and thrilling. I was on the edge of my seat the whole time. The whole movie keeps you guessing and absolutely terrified. I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes scary movies.

No doubt that this movie is scary but it loses it's feel half way through.The acting was mediocre. Well let me rephrase that: Scott Speedman was good but Liv Tyler almost seemed robotic.All in all, with a predictable last quarter you get your best effort in a new direction in the first half.

Sounds familiar? Yes. When both European and Asian horror-films have been remade, and there are no good horror-classics to remake, Bryan Bertino decides to use couple of years old French masterpiece Ils's concept blatantly to his profit. But he doesn't come even close David Moreau's and Xavier Palud's intense skills of directing. When most of the horror-genres clichés have been used, and when The Strangers are still moving in quite traditional American-horror frames, the nihilistic and hopeless ending of the movie just doesn't fit the concept.

Each scene definitely builds suspense in the beginning. Not knowing if the intruders are in the house or where they could be, is set up well. The masks and presentation of each intruder is quite terrifying. However, as the movie progresses, it falls into the same trap as many others. Scenes you can see coming a mile a away (esp. the friend getting shot). I had also hoped for an ending that was more satisfying. I felt like a lot of questions remained unanswered and issues unresolved. Yes, it was a random act of violence, but I needed more information on what motivated the killers.

WHY?! Is there not enough real crime in the world, I need to be entertained by fake crime and manufactured fear?! This world has serious problems.

673,x-freya,A few things people may not have noticed.,5,26 October 2008,"To start I would like to tell anyone that may read this about the 911 call we hear at the beginning of the film. To a first time viewer we just assume this is a woman calling the police about what has happened, but if you pay attention you will realize a few things: - It is not a woman, but actually a boy, his name is Jordan. - Jordan is in fact one of the church boys who has gone into the house as you see at the end and found the dead bodies. Another thing, nobody is quite sure whether Liv Tyler is dead at the end. I honestly can't tell you with 100% certainty whether she is or not myself. But if you watch closely you will see that as one of the church boys goes to feel her pulse, she opens her eyes and they both scream. This makes me assume, she is still alive. But on the contrary, it is one of the boys that calls the police saying everyone is dead. Surely if she was still alive he would mention this, or SHE would make the phone call. I've read people argue about what Liv says as 'The Strangers' take of their masks. To me it does sound like she says 'Amy' as if she knows the blonde girl. But I think it must just be her unclear pronunciation of baby, because if she did in fact know 'Amy' she would say more than just her name. ""Next time it will be easier"". This is said as a signal that there will be a next time (a sequel). If a sequel is made I truly hope they explain more about these 'Strangers'.

To begin, the actors all did a phenomenal job portraying their characters. You actually develop a sense of compassion for the two main characters and the ""strangers"" definitely deliver their shares of scares.There is not much blood, but the suspense is more than enough to keep you hooked on the movie as I, personally, had a few jumps.

In addition, I felt there was little progression of the danger in the situation. I found the movie was bearable only because I expected there to be more development of the story and background but I was sorely mistaken.There was only one moment in the movie that was satisfying to me in terms of ""thrills/chills,"" but I went to see The Strangers looking for more than that. However, I will give this movie credit for not using cheap gore to elicit a response from the audience.

There are few good horror movies that will become classics and this is so far on the opposite end of the spectrum that it could be considered comedic at some points.An enormous number of dumb moments and ""why would you do that?"" thoughts as I eventually lost interest maybe a 1/4 of the way into it.

683,Discoboy611,The Strangers (2008) - 7/10,7,31 May 2008,"The Strangers is a 2008 horror film directed and written by Bryan Bertino, and distributed by Rogue Pictures. The film score was composed by Tomandandy. Also, The Strangers is rated R by the MPAA for violence/terror and language. Nathan Kahane, Doug Davison, and Roy Lee were the producers of the movie. The budget of the movie was $10,000,000. Also, the reviews for the movie are overall mixed. At the very beginning of the film, the narrator says, ""The film you are about to see is inspired by true events. According to the F.B.I. there are an estimated 1.4 million violent crimes in America each year. On the night of February 11, 2005 Kristen McKay and James Hoyt went to a friend's wedding reception and returned to the Hoyt family's summer home. The brutal events that took place there are still not entirely known."" While staying at the isolated summer home, a young couple, Kristen McKay and James Hoyt, are terrorized and then later brutally stabbed by three masked individuals, presumably a family due to the structural appearance of the three strangers. A big amount of the film revolves around the strangers first cutting off their means of communication (such as destroying and stealing the phones in the house) and then lowering any other chances of escape (such as destroying James' car). After this is done, the strangers then continue to carry out their plan of killing the couple, which is revealed when the younger doll-faced masked stranger says to Kristen, ""You're gonna die here"". The couple is soon overpowered by the sheer number and terrorizing antics of the strangers and then knocked unconscious and tied up. The shades are opened to show that morning has come, and the three strangers begin taking off their masks. Although their faces are never fully revealed, removing their masks shows that they will soon carry out their plans to kill the couple. The male stranger then picks up a butcher knife and begins stabbing James repeatedly, then hands the knife to another stranger who then stabs James until the third stranger takes the knife and begins stabbing Kristen. The three strangers are then seen driving away in a pick-up truck and stop in the middle of the road. Two Mormon boys are walking along as one of the girl strangers asks to take a Christian Living pamphlet that one of the boys had with him. He asks her if she is a sinner, and she replies, ""Sometimes"" to him. He then gives her a pamphlet, and the three strangers drive off. When the boys finally end up at the house where James and Kristen had been stabbed, they both go into the house and find the couple. Just as one of the two boys is about to touch Kristen, her eyes open. The Strangers is a pretty solid film from start to finish. The movie is inspired by an event from the director's childhood, among other things. A stranger came to his home asking for someone. Later, he found out that empty homes in the neighborhood had been robbed. With that memory in mind, Bertino created The Strangers, his debut screenplay. It is also inspired by the events of the Charles Manson murders. The directing is pretty impressive and the acting isn't shabby either. This movie is a more of a movie that will make you jump in places, instead of being horrified for a very long time. The suspense is what truly shines on this film. There are multiple scenes of struggle that build up to a very exciting resolution. This is a great debut screenplay by Bryan Bertino, and it should be an enjoyable film to watch on a dark night. Cast Liv Tyler  Kristen McKay Scott Speedman  James Hoyt Gemma Ward  Dollface-masked woman Kip Weeks  The Man in the Mask Laura Margolis  Pinup Girl-masked woman Glenn Howerton  Mike Alex Fisher  Mormon Boy #1 Peter Clayton-Luce  Mormon Boy #2 Rating: 7/10",The Strangers

689,nikbin32092,Great Overall,9,30 May 2008,"Even though I had my eyes closed for the majority of the film, I still had a great picture of what was happening. The movie starts out right after the killings and the rest of the movie is mostly a flashback, but it is very easy to follow. It was interesting to notice the little bits and pieces of the crime scene when the movie first begins as they actually happen throughout the movie. The introduction of the main characters was believable and you actually begin to develop a connection with them, which makes it that much harder to watch. But besides giving everything away...this film did a great job in subtly scaring people; it was predictable as all horror films are, but you still had that seed of doubt in your mind throughout the entire movie and there are times were you are completely blindsided.The ONLY problem I had with this movie were how stupid the main characters were (as is the norm, but these people were just retarded).With only two moments of real gore, this film does a great job in scaring people in a real way.",The Strangers
690,luvsmodest,simple horror,5,16 June 2008,"I was not impressed with this movie at all. There are times when things are suspenseful; someone gets chased, a masked villain pops up suddenly into view, extremely long silences waiting, waiting and waiting. but add these ingredients into any mix and you can most likely expect to be scared. I'm sorry but adding ""this film is based on true events"" doesn't always make a flick scarier. It just makes me feel like you're trying too hard. Along with the clichés like tripping when getting chased, masked psychopaths toying with their helpless pray and having no (your phones dead?! how could that be?) way to contact the outside world just makes me all the more upset i spent money to see this. just like any movie, you give it the benefit of the doubt; you don't want to judge right away (what movie deserves that, right?). I kept waiting and waiting for some amazing scene but it just never came. i must say that the acting involving the two couples relationship was well done but when it came to surviving the cat-and-mouse antics of the so-called strangers they just became jabbering idiots; it just didn't feel real to me. how did i know she was going to say ""i love you"" at the end just before they were both stabbed? is it because that's what happens in real life? (perhaps we watch too many movies and then we don't know what to say at times so we play the roles of those people in the movies and then there are movies based on our playing the roles of those viewed movies). certainly not an intellectual thriller, nothing to have nightmares about and not a movie that deserves an A-quality rating. stick it in the back of the video store horror section with jeepers creepers 2 and the wicker man.",The Strangers
691,DeNov21713,Scary...if you are 12 years old,1,22 September 2008,"This is coming from someone who would never take the time to write a review of a movie unless it was absolutely brilliant, or downright horrible. In fact, this is the first and probably last review I will ever write.I am ashamed to say I sat through the whole hour and twenty or so minutes of this film hoping something would save this mess and make it somewhat worthwhile of my time. Well...looks like I am the fool here. This is undoubtedly one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen, quite possibly one of the worst in any genre in my opinion. The Strangers does not even deserve half of the 6.5 rating it has received. This is a completely pointless and asinine excuse for entertainment. If it weren't for the opening factoid expressing that 1.4 million violent crimes happen on average in the USA and that this story is based on true events (which is the scariest part of the whole movie) then you are left with senseless garbage. I am not even going to waste more of my time typing to give you examples within the plot line of how utterly ridiculous this movie is. I only wrote this to warn people to not waste their time thinking they might get a half decent movie. If you like loud ""suspenseful"" noises, a guy wearing a sandbag for a mask, along with two other girls with pretty doll face masks trying to break into a house and commit meaningless acts of violence this one might be for you.",The Strangers

So lots of people are giving mixed reviews for this film. Everything from 1 star to 9... Why? I believe it could be a simple matter of demographics!! The young crowd probably don't like it coz there are few special effects, gore, scary music etc. I however (as a 38 year old dude) thought it was great and very suspenseful. Simply because I could relate! Sure there are clichés but without those it probably wouldn't make for an exciting story.

693,lynchianlove,This movie made me mad,4,18 August 2011,"If you decide to watch this movie and are a true cinephile you will hate this movie not because it was terrible but because a young director invested his talent on a horrible story that translates terribly to film. The first act showed so much promise, which is another reason this movie is so disappointing and why my rating is higher than a 1. The atmosphere and tension are created very well within the first 20 minutes and then it goes down hill around the time The Strangers show up. Then it gets surprisingly boring. The performances are fine with the exception of Glenn Howerton who is really annoying as Speedman's friend. I praise the cinematography and the lighting and the young directors attempt to make a movie he seems passionate about. And when Bertino's next movie comes around I'll be sure to watch it because I know he has it in him to make a great film... unless of of course its The Strangers 2.",The Strangers

It is a teeny bit slow at getting started, but trust me, once is does get started, there is NO GOING BACK! The two lead characters did a great job, particularly Liv Tyler. She definitely carried this movie well. The three strangers were equally effective and couldn't have done a better job with their roles.

I was told that this was the director's first feature film ( I have not been able to verify that information). It was definitely a scary movie but some of the scenes were predictable such as when his friend Mike came into the home you knew there was going to be an accidental shooting. Either shot by your best friend or get an ax in the back? Hmmm anyway, I would definitely recommend everyone to see this movie.

If you are one that likes to watch something without thinking, and one who is dazzled by cheesy ""thrill cuts"" where people just jump out in front of the camera and can be amazed by watching Liv Tylor simply run and scream for 2 hours---then this is the movie for you...welcome to America's average intellect.",The Strangers

I was cowering in my seat,clutched to my husband. There were several times where it seemed to take too long to get to the suspense part of it. We did not feel sorry for any of the characters in the film. They were not explored in length and we really were not sorry to see them go.The ending was what really killed it for me. It was so anti-climatic and cliché, it made the rest of the movie just stupid.There was no real explanation as to why the killers killed. Noexplanation as to the reason why they wore masks. There were tons of discrepancies as well. It was really an insult to the audience.This movie would be perfect for the tween audience who are just getting their feet wet in the suspense/horror films.

Long story short: Compare both trailers and you will see they are the exact same!!!!! I can believe people get actually paid for directing a movie like this!!!This is the plot of Vacancy: David and Amy Fox find themselves stranded in the middle of nowhere when their car breaks down. Luckily, they come across a motel with a TV to entertain them during their overnight stay. However, there's something very strange and familiar about the Grade-Z slasher movies that the motel broadcasts for its guests' enjoyment. They all appear to be filmed in the very same room they occupy!

But,even if this movie doesn't have 'ghosts' in it, it is still scary. The sound effects were excellent and at the right time. The scary scenes are not predictable like recent 'attempts' to make horror movies like The Eye or The Tomb or The Attic (lol). Good acting by Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman. Also, there was a point in time when I thought that James (Speedman) was behind all this because she did not accept his proposal for marriage. Towards the end, when the strangers remove their masks, I was praying that it isn't anything stupid like they are James' friends or something planning for a surprise. Totally did not disappoint. Anyway, highly recommended. 8/10!",The Strangers

701,stephen-hopkins,'The Strangers' is a stranger to true horror films,3,8 June 2008,"The Strangers is a typical modern horror film, thus it lacks plot substance and tenacity. It was poorly directed and suffers from enormous holes in the storyline. There are several instances where the one of the two main characters are completely nonexistent on screen and their whereabouts are never explained or shown. This is acceptable if they temporarily leave in an attempt to spark the audience's imagination and creativity to take over, but these characters are so stereotypical and bland that ultimately we just do not care.The handful of truly suspenseful scenes qualified as neither ""scary"" or ""horrifying"". In addition, they are very predictable and only serve to keep the audience's attention amidst a plethora of lengthy, pathetic dialog. Cheap thrills were used like a drug to keep the story alive on a consistent basis, even into the credits. The ending is totally anti-climatic, even compared to the rest of the rather boring scenes.The film's promotions promised an exciting conclusion, as the couple finally confront the Strangers, but it failed to deliver and really just fizzled out at the end. Despite the ominous warning at the beginning of the movie stating that it is based on actual events, its premise was based entirely on the imagination of the writer and director combined with his childhood recollection of burglars knocking on his door... thats it. Ultimately it was not only a terrible horror film, it was a poor movie altogether. The bare-boned script and screenplay combined with sub-par directing ruined what could have been a somewhat intriguing story. It is worth a rent with a large group of friends, but if you miss it at the theaters you've saved some money and time.",The Strangers
702,allyneanne22,It's awesome!!!!,9,31 May 2008,"This movie was very edge of your seat scary. It focuses on a young couple spending time together in a secluded family home. Things seem to be going fine until a young woman shows up looking for someone who doesn't live there. After that the couple is terrorized by a threesome (1 guy and 2 ladies). Loud bangs, scraping noises, moved objects, and deadly weapons are only the beginning. The 3 ""invaders"" play with the couples minds like a cat plays with a mouse before it goes in for the kill. You never know what is going to happen or who is going to pop up when. I found this movie to be much more interesting then other horror films I've seen because it's VERY believable. It's hard to be scared by films like Halloween or Friday the 13th when you have a villain that can't be killed and always seems to beat you to your destination even though they never run or put in any type of effort. This is the type of scary film that could easily happen. People break into your house and scare the crap out of you and play with your mind. I strongly suggest this film to any scary movie buffs out there!!!",The Strangers
703,Richieparrish,"""The Strangers"".... Not very strange",4,1 June 2008,"The Strangers grabs your attention from the beginning with the scary voice and the ""What you are about to see is based on true events"" and ""The following events are still not entirely known"" and does an excellent job of showing two characters that appeal weak at first but gain strength towards the end. However, I was disappointed with the overall direction the film went after the first 15 to 20 minutes. The 45 or so minutes in between the beginning and the end could have but entirely cut from the movie and I still would have known what was going on. My point is that this causes boredom. Don't get me wrong, the movie did a good job of scaring the hell out of me, but after the seeing the masks every 30 seconds got old. It was constantly showing the MESSED up masked strangers in the distance, and then vanish. I also didn't like how the strangers could just disappear when one of the main characters turned around. It is a movie, yes, but it could have been a little more realistic. I gave it a 6 out of 10 which in my opinion is a little generous. It would have gotten a 5 but the masks that the strangers wore have scarred me for life for being so terrifying and when ""Doll Face"" girl knocked at the door at the beginning without a mask but you could barely see her face got me pretty good. End of story, I won't see it again for a while and even then I'll have trouble picking it off the shelf over The Sixth Sense or Halloween.

The scenes are quite predictable and you already know when something bad will happen. I kept thinking the whole time, If someone were to try this crap with me I would blow them away with my .357 Mag and wouldn't miss or not know how to load it. It always seems that the only way for a horror movie to take place, is for the victims to act like brainless idiots and nearly begging the killer to do as they wish. I gave this movie 3 out 10 stars, would have been lower but Liv Tyler is hot.I was thinking about asking for my money back but I didn't want to make a big deal and I hadn't trusted my gut to go see the new Indiana Jones like I was planning to.",The Strangers

706,cpep08-1,Yeah.. Wtf just happened?,5,30 May 2008,"This movie was alright. It started really well, then once the two split up, it went downhill. The movie wasn't as predictable as most horror movies are, but I did predict one specific thing. Which I won't name, but happened before the couple split to give you a hint. The previews to this movie made it look bad-ass, but after seeing it the previews were completely misleading. I won't say what happened at the end, but I was in complete shock (not a horror shock either). In the beginning of the movie it says that it's based on ""true events"", then the next paragraph it says that it happened in 2005 and the FBI still don't know the specifics. I say if you don't know the specifics, don't say it's based on true events. Yeah, a true event might of been three people terrorizing a helpless couple, but I think that's the only ""true event"" this movie has.",The Strangers
707,mahadjohnson,Look at the big picture.,10,31 May 2008,"Let me first say that I had been anticipating this movie for a long time, therefore I may be a bit biased. However, friends of mine who had not been waiting like I had came out of the theater with the same feelings as me. Which were, get to the car as quickly as possible, check the back seat, and get away. For the next few hours you will sit there and talk to each other about the movie, not wanting to, but not being able to focus or think about anything else (for example, I am a huge sports fan and sat through 3 quarters of the Celtics/Pistons game 6 with the TV right in front of me but I could not have told you the score, who was winning, or who was playing well, I could only talk and think about this movie). This was truly a terrifying movie that had me checking over my shoulders for no less than 5 hours after I left the theater.First off, I have seen a lot of reviews that say the movie started off with a couple going to a vacation house for a romantic weekend, blah blah blah. This is not true and if the person really watched the movie I do not understand how they get that out of it. It was SUPPOSED to be a romantic weekend set up by Speedman for a newly engaged couple. However, he did not anticipate Tyler saying no to his proposal. Making the movie awkward and suspenseful from the very beginning as you could cut the tension between Speedman and Tyler with a knife. This would be the main feeling of the movie, suspense, terror, utter despair, pick your favorite.The main complaint over this movie is all of the ""clichés."" However, the clichés used in this movie are used perfectly and while you may have a feeling for what is going to happen, you have no idea exactly what or when. The clichés used in this movie were those of another generation. Great masks, creepy voices, perfectly timed loud sounds and of course seemingly haunting music. They were the clichés of Halloween, and the creation of the true slasher film. Instead of recent years where movies have had to resort to extreme violence in order to get a scare out of the audience because the lack of depth in acting or a storyline. This movie will have you truly terrified when you walk out of the theater. I am not one easily scared by horror/suspense movies, but this one scared me like I was a little kid again.It was not until hours after I left the theater that I finally calmed down, stopped looking over my shoulders and stopped wondering if there was something waiting for me in the dark areas of my house. This is when I also got to thinking about the movie in its entirety. Not only as being terrifying but every aspect. I could not stop thinking about Speedman's character. This was a guy who started off his day by going up to this house and setting up a romantic evening which he thought would come following the love of his life saying yes to his marriage proposal. However, she said no. He then follows that up with a side of accidentally murdering his best friend (which yes, I saw coming from a mile away), however, it still terrified me not knowing when it was going to happen, and that along with the male stranger creeping down the hall behind Mike, unknown to him, with an ax, made me sink down in my seat. Then at the end of the day, Speedman himself is killed. Topping off what had to be the worst day in human history for a single person. He went from proposing to the love of his life, to in fact losing his own life. While Tyler was there holding his hand, he had to feel alone, and he had to feel that her holding his hand was yet another cliché and not necessarily genuine given her rejection of his proposal in the beginning. None the less, at the end Tyler takes his hand, and she is wearing the wedding ring that she had turned down just hours before, thus probably giving him some kind of consolation for the whole thing, and I guess making it easier to take the oncoming execution.This movie was truly terrifying. Anyone who puts up a review and says it was not scary is a liar. They simply needed something to write in order to keep their computer screen on a bit longer to illuminate a dark room in which they were alone. This movie will scare you initially and it will stay with you. If you do not want to have the feeling that someone is behind you constantly and that you are never safe or alone, do not go see this movie. However, if you want a genuine scare that moviegoers have not had since the likes of Halloween and The Shining, this is the movie for you. Its scariest aspect is the fact that sadly enough in this day and age something like this could easily happen. Masked madmen could really pull something like this off simply because ""we were home."" One bit of advice, lock your windows and doors before going to the movie. When you get home the first thing you will think is ""are all of my windows and doors locked?"" However, at that point you will be too freaked out to actually go to each room and check because the true fear you have is of the dark area in your living room that you can't clearly see and you will constantly be wondering what is lurking in the shadows.",The Strangers

The ending is quite a shocker and it definitely leaves the viewer in a state of utter bewilderment. I think thats one of the things I liked about this movie. My stomach was doing flips inside of me as I watched this movie. It kept me wanting more. Liv does a wonderful job of portraying her character. She was VERY believable. I was very satisfied when I left the movie theate. I hope it brings its other viewers the satisfaction and thrill it brought me.",The Strangers

They make this film scary in my opinion. Those little girls scare the jeepers out of you a couple times. I think the major downfalls that this movie has is its length (very short) and its very disturbing ending. The ending just made my stomach turn and I almost felt upset that I had sat there and watched that happen. Overall, very good film...I can tell you right now I will never watch it alone or in a woods or at a lake house thats for darn sure.

This movie holds you for about 15 to 30 of the opening minutes, but from that point forward, this movie takes a dramatic dive down in quality and it seems like the longer the movie goes, the faster it is diminishing and is becoming harder to watch. The ending to this movie is one of the worst I have seen to a thriller in a long, LONG time. Whoever directed this movie should consider a career change. It is that much of a waste of time. The plot and concept of this movie are pretty good ideas, but the execution in production and direction is just unbearable. If you are a fan of good thrillers and great scary movies, do yourself a favor and pass this one by.",The Strangers
718,mochulski,Director obsessed with Mansonesque themes,5,2 June 2008,"The front yard looks a lot like Cielo Drive - the masks on the killers and what we see when they take them off look a lot like Susan Atkins et al and the closing line of their dialog strikes a chord of the Family -- so what we see here I believe is a Director who is curious concerning what it may have been like on Cielo Drive in early August of 1969 -- he got the production money -- his dime -- so go for it. The only question is (like Ms. Tyler asks throughout the film) why? Sure it made me jump a few times - even though you could predict it -- and there is some decent crafting here (e.g. lighting and camera work is exceptional) - but there is not much else here. It also wrecks a decent country classic in Mama Tried by Merle Haggard which is misplaced, but maybe not, since the narrative has really no ground to walk on. The opening clips are intriguing concerning the slide-show like imagery of anyhouse America, as if the Strangers are just randomly selecting a house -- this does add a sense of horror as of these three are just starting their rampage and the wheel just stops on a country house where our stars will end up. I was definitely into it at that point. Then when the first knock of the door comes, it definitely gets the blood boiling and the brief discussion the protagonists have with the killer girl is quite good and eerie - but again -- if this was a true story and not a homage - it would strike direct terror. Most of us know what happened to Sharon Tate and if you play it over in your head it is stupefying. To see it recreated with cinematic tone and overlays of other horror-flicks - it just can't work as well -- it does not have the devilish backdrop of Manson and his manipulative ways. There is not enough time in any film to create that.",The Strangers

720,jonesboy801,junk movie better off as a coaster than a screen play,1,4 June 2008,"I would have to agree with jason kiff this movie sucked I payed way too much to see such a poorly developed film. No character development there killers' motives are purely random the people in. the movie react to things in th dumbest and most inefficient manner I hated this movie almost as much as one missed call but I would almost rather watch one missed call more. This movie can hardly be called a classic. And if I hear any more idiots compare this to the halloween series or the shining I might just kill someone myself. I would rather watch a killer who never dies than watch these ridiculous, impulse driven buffoons ride off into the sunrise(not the sunset) in an old beat up ford truck. Then to really make the viewers angry in the end even though the girl gets stabbed an unnumbered amount of times(which was rather disturbing) she still lived what in the name of wes craven is going on . This was just another excuse for a basement director to make millions. Horror movies just aren't what they used to be the only reason people actually go see them is because as viewers we are in a never ending search for more classics like the old days in the horror genre.P.s. This movie stunk up the building.",The Strangers
721,xurbeautiful,Cheap thrill,3,4 June 2008,"Just as its predecessor horror films, ""The Strangers"" is a real life depiction of some of our worst nightmares. No actual story line of any significance but it does the job if you're looking for a cheap scare. The movie begins when a young couple Kristen and James, (Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman,) return home from a wedding where James's proposal of marriage was rejected by Kristen. Both heartbroken from the incident, they ignore each other and allow the audience to feel connected and sympathetic. After many moments of awkward pauses the two start to make love, when an unexpected knocking startles them. They open the door to find a young girl asking for someone who doesn't live there. After the girl leaves James goes to get Kristen cigarettes. While James's gone the stalking continues. This is the point I believe when the movie goes from something relatable to just another pointless horror film with no meaning. The three unknown strangers persist to stalk the couple. Finally, they kill the couple. Their only explanation being ""because you were home."" Ooh scary. On the plus side at least ""The Strangers"" wasn't as generic as some of the other horror movies such as ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" and ""Halloween"" 1-100. SPOILER ALERT: Surprisingly, both main characters die, rather than keeping them alive to watch them fall in love. Sweet story but that ""good prevails act"" is pretty tired. But of course Kristen falls into all the typical actions we're used to: running outside, hiding in the closet, so on and so on. All in all this movie is worth seeing if you have some extra time and a few bucks that aren't needed else where. I wouldn't sacrifice any valuable time for this movie, but it does its job, making audiences shriek, but by the time you get home you'll forget why you were scared.",The Strangers

The house is large, the setting remote and the music is ""encouraging"". The ""strangers"" look and act scary. James is taunted over an unthinkable error. Psychological terror precedes physical violence ... this is one frightening movie! There were times where I felt like I needed to move a few rows back from where I was sitting.

The Strangers was one of them.There was no character development and it was extremely predictable. One thing that really annoyed me was all the tension is built up with music. The only reason people jump is because they're being assaulted by a very loud noise. Who wouldn't jump at loud noises? However, since the movie was so predictable you could anticipate when the loud noise was going to come, so it didn't do much good after the first couple ""scares"".If you watch the preview, you get the impression that this movie is going to be super creepy. Make your skin crawl creepy... make you afraid to look out your window creepy. The preview is about as creepy as it gets.I watched an hour of the movie before I walked out.

724,randombarbi3,"strangers= no story line, but scary",6,5 June 2008,"What makes a movie scary? Is it the relatablity , the unknown, suspense, or the fact that its based on real events? The new movie ""The strangers"" has all these scare factors. The movie begins when a young couple (Liv Tyler and Scott Speadman) return home from a wedding to their secluded home. In the middle of having a very intimate moment they hear a loud bang on the door. When they open it there is a young girl at the door. Before they can say anything the girl ask if a girl that doesn't live there is home. After they reply that there is no one there with that name. The suspense begins. The movie unfolds like every other scare movie. They run, scream, hide, and make stupid decisions. Word of advice people don't investigate the loud noisesJust hide. For an hour the couple is chased around their house and yard by three masked killers. The killers' identities were never revealed. SPOILER ALERT When the couple can no longer find a new hiding spots in their house the movie ends with the killers stabbing the couple and them and leaving them to die. The thing is the movie has no story line. Yes, the movie does offer some awesome scares. The movie goes on and on and there's no plot. Things just happen to make the audience scream. The only success of the movie is that it truly is scary. I recommend waiting on this movie to come out on video, and don't expect a complex deep meaning movie.

The previews were okay, but the fact that Liv Tyler was in this movie was the main thing that sold me. The opening of the movie gave you enough character depth to gain some kind of attachment to the main characters, without overloading you with redundant and arbitrary information you don't need to enjoy a horror movie. The plot, overall, is actually pretty realistic compared to some of the horror films out today that are just plain stupid (The Hills Have Eyes, anyone?), and the film definitely has several moments where you jump out of your seat (even if in the back of your mind you KNOW what's about to happen). The movie does have a few cliché moments (that's to be expected in ALL horror/suspense films), has a few refreshingly new ideas, and the directors definitely pull off the suspense with their distinct absence of music at many suspenseful parts, and ""up"" the eerie quite a bit when old folk/country records are playing loudly in the house during some of the scenes. If you're into a lot of blood and gore movies, this is NOT for you; there are very few bloody scenes in this, but enough to satisfy and creep out the majority of people. My only complaint was the very ending, which only caused people to scoff as they left the theater. My rating is 6/10, but would have been higher if it would have had a better ending (I imagine that the directors are setting up for a sequel). Not a bad movie at all!",The Strangers

The key to a successful scary movie is suspense which this movie lacked. If you thought something scary was there - it was there. This movie was completely predictable. It was poorly written with horrible acting. This movie is definitely not worth the price of a movie ticket. The only entertainment I got out of the whole movie was the people who were laughing at the ""scary"" parts (which was the whole theater)and all the idiots who screamed whenever the inevitable scary person popped up on the scene. There were too many, ""well why didn't they just do this"" or ""well when did she have time to do that"" type moments.

I'm in no way shape or form a scary movie buff, but my friend is and he agreed that it was not good. I did not think it was scary. It was very predictable.

I would've received more pleasure burning the money with a magnifying glass on a sunny summer afternoon. (at least I would get a tan doing that) Please do not see this movie. There is minimal plot structure and an obvious ending, as it says during the movie that no one knows the whole truth of what happened that night... meaning no survivors. (sorry) Except for the weird Christian boys at the end, whatever that was about. (Where was the underlying Christianity theme? I must've missed it.)I will admit I jumped out my seat twice, thanks to some cool camera work and nice shrieking sound effects. Other than that, this movie was a plain old ordinary horror film. The protagonists get scared, and begin doing the dumbest things I've ever seen. I found myself getting angry at them several times throughout the movie for just being so stupid, I didn't know why I continued to put myself through this. (Yup, it's one of ""those"" types) And I kept waiting for more plot development, maybe a twist in the plot somewhere, maybe it would be a setup involving the male protagonist's friend, but I was just disappointed.

After that, the movie just got boring. Sure there were some pop-ups that kept you paying attention but other than that the repetitiveness was overwhelming. The whole movie was basically three masked people chasing the couple around their home for an hour and a half. There were no twists at all. The ending was also horrible. No explanation was given for why the strangers killed them and the very end when Liv Tyler jumped up when the Mormon boys when into the home was extremely pointless.And I don't get why people say the couples actions were believable. If you have a shotgun, blow them away. If you just got attacked outside by one of the strangers, don't run back into the house where another one of them will probably be at. If you pull up to the house to be greeted with a rock through your windshield, and the house door is wide open with a mysterious pick up truck in the drive away, call 911 before you go investigate.If you wanna leave the movie theater extremely disappointed, I strongly suggest you see this movie.

I don't want to give too much away, but after 10 minutes, we get that they are ""unhappy."" Must this point be driven into the ground? The intense, dramatic parts also dragged on and on and on. The ""strangers"" took an awful long time to get busy. It was just awful, not a type of anticipation awful, just plain irritation awful.I was so anxious for this movie to end I almost could not contain myself. Yes, there were shocking parts, but the manor in which the scenes were displayed were simply over kill. It made me want to scream, ""Alright, already. Get on with the thing!""

The film manages to build up a fair bit of tension and has a fair few scenes that will make you jump. There are so many great bits in this film that give it huge potential like shots with strangers in the dark background stalking their prey so you can barely notice them and playing on swings to intimidate the victims. So with all of this you'd think that you have a great film ahead of you but you'll find yourself mistaken when you realise the film has no real plot and towards the end of the film gets a bit dull.

It is an utter shame we cannot ask for our money back and then sue the theater, Producers and Directors for displaying such a worthless and mindless piece of mess. There were majorly huge continuity issues, no well thought out scenes, I honestly do not believe kids (let alone adults) would walk into a disheveled bloody house, saunter around and snooping being nosy and then comfortably kneel by a brutally attacked bloody person to stare? I could be wrong but logically thinking, hauling butt to the nearest home or store for help makes more sense. But this film isn't about sense is it? It is about a gibberish calamity of idiotic errors of judgment and actions showcasing blundering clueless people who cannot figure out how to get out of the house for help and how the killers somehow have the innate ability to conveniently stroll in and out of a house full of locked doors and windows to pursue and complete a terroristic campaign. Why wasn't the car fire reported by a neighbor? It is against the law in any state to have an out of control fire working in a residential neighborhood. Flying embers and debris. That is the law. Also, the victims could not have been too far from civilization for the two young boys to walk and cycle around? As the boys walked, there were numerous houses in the vicinity. Anyway, the ex-fiancé/boyfriend's dialogue and actions were hysterically dense and pointless. I have no idea why he was there. I was so sick and tired of listening to Liv Tyler scream that I felt like screaming from the pain of it all. And then, the brilliant best friend (in conjunction with all of the other stupid situations that occurred throughout the film), drives up, never notices that the car he is approaching from the rear in the single columned driveway has been in some type of accident. Luckily for him a rock is thrown in his front windshield, to allow him to flee from his truck, stretch his legs and discover the obvious overlooked truth of him and his friend's banged up vehicle. Instead, the dimwit friend stands outside of his truck delivering the best line he probably auditioned with and then haphazardly notices the back of his friends bashed in car? Was he not paying attention as he drove up? Ash...I guess not. Genus! Instead of him jumping back into his truck and rapidly backing his butt off of the property to safety while calling for help on his cell phone, he intelligently strolls up to the ax riddled shot gun tattered front door and painstakingly walks 2-3 minutes from the front door to the hallway (a short walk mind you) through the house that looks as awful as the last ""Halloween 99  Jason reincarnated"" version of a massacre movie, slowly turns his head because he hears something behind him? He not one time called out for his friends. What the heck! Hahahahahaahahah...Brother! There are too many mishaps to post.Just wow what a joke! This film was so beyond valueless it is not advantageous expounding about it any longer. The bottom line. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY!! If this project manages to make it to the tele (which I hope it never does) TURN THE CHANNEL QUICKLY AND DON'T GO BACK TO THAT CHANNEL UNTIL 2 HOURS LATER!! Spare yourself the grief..Actually, this film can't even be use as a ""Don't let This Happen To You"" book for dummies for potential Directors and Producers.But you would be dumb to go see it.If this is a true story, I am very sorry it happened and that this production made such a mockery of the story line; some things and stories are better left alone.I hope I have not ruined anything for anyone but this project is not good I am sorry to say and I do not mean to be cruel. Also, remember the actors can only give what they have to work with. Most over, some projects cannot be saved no matter what phenomenal actors are used. I enjoy Liv Tyler as an actor. With her abilities, she couldn't dig this one out of the ditch.This was just not a good project at all.Use your best judgment.Sincerely",The Strangers

With pure suspense as its sole engine, the effect was strong enough to drive moviegoers from their seats. There is no way casual horror-fans could stand this film. It is simply terrifying.The acting is excellent and the cinematography is savory and artful. The lighting in particular is inspired, and the soundtrack is minimal and hip.The two primary criticisms are (1) the unconventional behavior of the main characters, and (2) that the horror seems to have no relevant point. The characters behave in such a way as to give their assailants every opportunity to terrorize them, which can be frustrating. Nevertheless, I only ruminated about what they could or could not have done differently AFTER the movie, as I was too engrossed in it at the time to notice anything unusual.The lack of relevance is notable. Apparently we are being scared simply for scare-sake. Nothing is redeemed and everything is perfectly bleak and rather documentary-like in its unflinching unfolding of the story.Still, these two points are easily assimilated. This is a wonderful film that is positively haunting in the most intense way. Believe me, there is no trace of humor, ticklish screams, cheese, camp, family fun, or anything of that nature. Instead it is dead-scary and leaves you with the sense that something similar could without-a-doubt happen to anybody, even yourself.~ J",The Strangers
742,jdrosato,This movie was terrible,1,18 June 2008,First of all they are already lying to you when they say the movie is 90 minutes. The movie listing was 8:10 then you have to take into account all of the previews and ads... the credits were rolling at 9:31. Even if you count the previews and credits that's still not 90 minutes. Second of all it was not scary nor suspenseful. It was very predictable not only to me but all in the theater since everyone was yelling out what was going to happen next. There was not really a plot nor a satisfying ending. I personally felt cheated as did many other patrons who actually decided to form a line after the movie to file complaints and ask for a refund. If they had made this a full length feature film it might have been better but since they tried to cram it all into an hour it was very disappointing.,The Strangers
743,nubbiejones,"""The Strangers"" is a one trick pony begging for attention...",6,20 June 2008,"""The Strangers"" is essentially a recycled bag of slasher movie tricks. All of the slasher staples are there. Spooky masks, bad guys that disappear when main characters look away, and the ever fun, ""walk up behind someone while holding an ax or other implement of destruction but do them no harm"" routine. There are a host of juvenile delinquent tricks too. From pounding on the front door, to creepy messages written in lipstick.I would say that this film was excellent were it produced by a college film class and cut down to about 20 minutes. If you grew up with older siblings, you probably will not be impressed by much in this film, for what amounts to a day in the life for the average American kid with a mean spirited older brother is stretched to 90 minutes of ""so what.""Do yourself a favor, skip it in the theater, rent it some cool summer night and watch it with the lights out.",The Strangers
744,stevenfiedlernj,A Waste of Money!,1,22 June 2008,"This movie is just dreadful!! The Plot is really stupid, I can not believe someone can actually watch this retarded movie and like it. It really makes no sense, nor it is scary. Comparing this disaster to the Shinning is just an insult to a very good movie. I couldn't wait to leave the movie. The acting is really bad, stupid and again, it made no sense whatsoever. I would much rather go and get a tooth pull than go back to see this atrocity of a movie. Don't waste your time and money. The movie is just not worth it. The movie goes on and on and on and it seems there is no ending to the pain the viewer suffer while enduring this movie.",The Strangers

Very unimpressive story, actors, action,...etc. Movie costs were low, and I do not suggest here an absolute linear correlation between costs and excellence. The director focused a lot on sound effects trying to make the movie scary, and still I can not call it scary movie. I watched the movie with three friends, and non of us have understood the end!! Was the woman alive or dead?? what about the Children?? Who were the killers? I thought I was missing something. I do not recommend watching it. Save your money or watch different movie.",The Strangers

All you have is two people running around in circles throughout a house/yard. Ridiculously awful. The actors couldn't be any more dumb throughout this movie. Everyone in the theater was just waiting for something to happen..and nothing ever does. Everyone just walks out of this movie scratching their heads wondering why they just wasted 10 bucks and 2 hours of their time for this movie? It went no where, no character development, no plot development. Stupid and amateur to say the least. The Strangers should be put in the same group as Kazzam with Shaq.",The Strangers
747,heywuzupguwl,"A little derivative, but extremely suspenseful and quite frightening.",10,3 July 2008,"I can't recall the last time I went to the theater and saw a horror film that actually scared me, that is, until I saw ""The Strangers"". I was a wreck during this movie - the suspense is wound like a tight wire and it just pulls more and more until you feel like it's going to snap right at you - and it does. The story follows a troubled couple who are attacked by three masked intruders with evil intentions at their remote vacation house. This movie has a sort of ""old school"" feel to it, and relies on small things to scare you (rather than buckets of blood and gore), but it does it successfully. Everything from the sound design, the cinematography, and the appearances of the strangers themselves are beyond chilling, and the reactions of the characters are realistic. Bottom line is, if you like horror movies (especially if you're a fan of old school horror such as Carpenter's ""Halloween"" and the like) you'll probably find this to be an enjoyable throwback to a genre that is losing its integrity. ""The Strangers"" is well worth the price of admission - I saw it a week ago and I'm still a little jittery if I'm home by myself! Great horror flick, and probably the classiest one to hit theaters in a long, long time.",The Strangers
748,asdfpunko,Good Thriller but Bad Everything Else,4,8 July 2008,"Let me start off by saying that this movie is great if you don't like thinking or you just like being scared in general. Scary wise, this movie does make the cut, but it leaves you quite angry at how ignorant the victims are. *SPOILER* How can a full grown man with a shotgun be taken down by three people w/o guns (a man, a girl, and a woman)? Not to mention that he had several loads of ammunition for his shotgun. *END SPOILER*For me, this movie was a 4 out of 10 because of it's lack of common sense. I know that this is how most scary movies are supposed to be, but I thought the victims could have had brains bigger than peanuts.",The Strangers
749,beyond_polaris,Not a typical Slasher or Splatter film,7,8 July 2008,"I went to the theater expecting to see what I thought would be a violent slasher horror film in the vein of Texas Chainsaw Massacre or more recently Hostel. The film opens much like chainsaw massacre with the statement that the events you are about to see are true. This disclaimer much like the one that runs at the beginning of Chainsaw Massacre is of course for the most part false since the events in both films are almost 99% fiction with maybe 1% fact (that is a kind estimate). Then two young boys on bicycles enter a house in shambles which is clearly the murder scene followed by a frantic 911 call. Based on the opening sequence I assume my first impressions of the film from the trailer are correct and this is another ridiculously predictable slasher film full of the usual gratuitous violence, bad language and obligatory T & A. I settle into my seat smile on my face ready to enjoy a bit of predictable formula fun. I am quickly surprised however by the behavior of Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman in the sequences that follow. Instead of being the happy couple enjoying life heading off to a fun filled weekend the typical victims of the slasher film. They are clearly troubled as evidenced by Liv Tyler’s tear streaked face and smeared make up. This started the film out in a very melancholy mood which only continued as the audience comes to find out that the reason for the main characters discontent is that Liv Tyler’s character has just rejected a marriage proposal from Scott Speedman. After they arrive at the house they are staying at strange things begin to occur like a young girl knocking on the door repeatedly asking for some one who doesn’t live their, faces in the windows, items being moved about while the characters are not around. Eventually the masked trio behind the weird occurrences makes their presence known and then basically terrorizes the couple until the film reaches it’s obvious conclusion. This film is not at all the slasher film I thought it would be instead it is more of a throwback to the older Hitchcock films using less blood and guts and more psychological terrors (don’t worry there is blood). Over all I would have to say I enjoyed the movie. It was not completely original or extremely well written but it was something I have not seen in awhile a refreshing reminder of time when directors relied on more then just fake blood or special effects to get a rise out of their audience.",The Strangers
750,benjamin_bramblett,how terrible,1,23 August 2008,"this is such a waste of time, i like to consider my myself somewhat of a movie buff but this was so utterly horrible. Aerosmith wont be making a song for this soundtrack because i don't know how you could attach you name to this failure. If any of you have seen entourage, this reminds me of Medellin how the trailer looks good but the movie is terrible. I'd rather watch a supernatural thriller than this. The entire movie is rising action with a horrible climax/ending. PLEASE DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME LIKE ME AND MY GIRLFRIEND DID. I'm just in a bad mood now because i actually looked forward to seeing this. If loud noises scare you then i recommend leaving the states for the fourth of July, because that is about how scary it is.

I simply cannot stand how terrible ""horror"" movies have become since at least 2001 to present.

So 2 days later i saw it on my 19'inch PC screen and again all i have to say is ""POOR LIV Tyler"" for doing this ""DONE IT"" in Hollywood scary flick. Too close to ""Vacancy"". I mean no plot at all what so ever! Why not just kill them already instead of this slow senseless up and down and up roller coaster high school terror game that ""The Strangers"" are playing to them. Liv Tyler is a ""A"" list actor in Hollywood and for her to do this bad plot scary film is beyond my thought. I am a fan or horror films but this is really bad.

The story was terrible worst script and predictable however i like the way it was directed, the strangers hiding so close yet unseen to the victims was so amazing i actually enjoyed this movie. Liv Tylers performance was amazing the way she showed her fear was classic, She made this film stand out and let you feel her fear as she whimpered on her own in the dark a legend scene.The way the strangers ""toyed"" with Tyler was unoriginal yet it played well into the movie and the camera angles shifting in and out of focus was a nice touch. Though the story was a bit sad the acting and way it was directed makes it a watchable movie i give it a 7/10",The Strangers

THis movie had no plot, no storyline, the acting was horrible, and the 'strangers' were not very scary.I was so disgusted i wasted my precious time & money watching this. I can't believe i stayed to watch the whole thing. I was hoping it would get better, but it only got worse and worse. I don't understand why anyone would watch this. What were the writers/directors thinking? HOw can you release crap like this and sleep soundly at night!Shame on you who ever had anything to with this movie.

NO! you simple do not know when something terribly exciting will happen. Go see at your local cinema, and i promise you will jump out your skin! At the start of the film when it says it was based on a true story i was shocked! How can such evil and nasty people taunt innocent people? The China masks, and the potato sack i think it is, will probably creep you out, especially when they appear from no where, anyway go to the cinema with your friend or girlfriend, this is one of those films that your girlfriend will ask to hold your hand its that scary! for a rated 15 movie this is the scariest i've seen!horrifyingly excellent 10 stars **********",The Strangers
756,kt868725,"Not the worst, but definitely powerful",9,24 August 2008,"I decided on such a high rating, because I am still messed up over this movie since I saw it. I have to put the TV on before I go to bed, while I used to sleep in the pitch dark. I think it is powerful enough to visually overthrow what you would like to have pop up in your mind at night, but I agree that there are some flaws.The fact that the characters did go in and out of the house aimlessly, at least foolishly is just ridiculous. However, whether you think this is what makes the movie awful or not, it does offer suspense as to what will result with this poor decision.You may find yourself yelling at the characters, asking them why on this earth would you do that, but that's the fun in it. Why does the boyfriend (almost fiancé) leave her alone? He's an idiot, but what can you do, except watch and wait to see just what a moron he is. The plot is thin, but the lack of spoken word is how it can be very scary and the silence is what can trip you up and put the images in the shadows into your mind so easily; no defining sound attached to it, when you close your eyes.What I will say, that is pretty bad about this movie is how it ends. I guess if you read up on it and how it's a throwback to the Manson stories, it makes sense. I have never previously seen, a merciless viewing of gruesome stabbing. Most of the time, the filming is jerky and doesn't quite focus on the subject, but that scene didn't let up and that was overly disturbing.So, if you want to say that the characters are dumb and it makes the movie less appealing to you, I will raise the question, ""Aren't all horror movie characters dumb and isn't that what makes it so entertaining and engaging?"". (except of course the little boy in The Shining at the end, that was very clever in the maze)I don't know about you, but my friend and I, are still scared to this day, if that means anything.",The Strangers

Id have to give this film a 5/10 for having me on edge and full of suspense but apart from that this was rubbish.the ending simply ruined it for me.

No attempt is made to redeem this movie at the end by adding in some sort of twist... just a petty grasp at one final scare when the lead actress (Liv Tyler) presumed dead... awakens screaming in a Mormon child's face - which i personally found rather amusing! On a lighter note, if any of you people reading this haven't yet seen the dark knight...

Then it all went downhill, by the end I truly believe most of the audience were almost wishing the couple to be -dispatched- by the 'strangers'. That good old 'I'm in trouble what mistakes shall I make to ensure the bad people can get me' scenario started. I know I'm a soldier and probably have a greater understanding of defending a position than most but surely self preservation is a human being's greatest sense. Let's see, they have a weapon (pretty good one too), they have safety in numbers (2 of them) they have a good defensive position (many rooms) but they divise ways to throw all these away until the ultimate happens. As I stated a great first 30 minutes, but then after the 12th chance the 'strangers' had to take them but didn't I'm afraid you knew it wasn't going to end well.

The latter is what I personally do when I don't like a movie like 15 minutes off the start.If You wanna see a thriller on this subject get ""Inside"".

The movie is so dumb that there are umpteen number of goof-ups and most of the times you can simply feel the stupidity.For example: 1) Midway through the movie Liv Tyler changes from a nightgown to shirts and jeans and then suddenly she reappears back in the gown. Don't give me BS that the killers changed her dress :P 2) We see two Mormons who enter the house at the end of the movie, see blood and corpses but are neither shocked nor frightened but rather awestruck or fascinated.

762,Almightywill,Big Faces and Loud Noises,4,9 September 2008,"""The Strangers"" Is a film we've all seen before; A weak attempt at leading us into a false sense of security before bombarding you with minor heart attacks. These are achieved using the all to familiar faces behind every closed door and taking advantage of the Cinema's Bose sound system routine, as apposed to the more artistic horror films out there.A couple of contrasting areas in this film had me confused. Throughout the film these people seem impossible to kill, and there are the notions that they are super human, when the main scarer gets shot with a shotgun and suffers no bruises. Yet when they are realized as normal people (I say normal very loosely) the whole situation seems a bit farcical. I do realize that it's based on a true story, but I think they milked it a bit too much to drag me in.Partially I feel quite abused with all the cheap scares I was constantly submitted too, with classic moments, including the main man saying ""I guess there's nothing left to do - except for open this curtain!"" revealing yet another big face accompanied by a loud blast on the speakers. Granted he might not have said those exact words but the meaning was there. Obviously Brian Bertino was running out of places to add these elaborate thrills to.Having said all that, if your in the mood for a quick scare, or want to break the ice on a first date, this definitely is the film to see, as it will make you jump!And really, the Axe through the door?! They're not even trying any more!",The Strangers
763,dsinclair1987,Boring,4,6 December 2008,"I was intrigued at first by the idea behind the film although i felt thoroughly let down. The build up of tension in places was good but never really pushed the scary button with me. the villains appear and disappear in an instant which i found frustrating. they were introduced early in the film and i got bored waiting for what i knew was going to happen. unlike most films they didn't over do it with the blood and gore. in this case they should of. Who could possibly get stabbed several times and not spill a drop of blood on the floor? Again this made it slightly unbelievable. The ending confused me as well, why did the killers remove there masks and why didn't we see there faces? did Liv Tyler survive? one thing that did make me laugh though was right at the very end. the film started out saying it was inspired by true events and ended by saying everything was completely fictitious. 9 minutes of credits was a bit much also",The Strangers
764,ashli_23,Certainly worth a watch!,7,15 February 2009,"This movies first half is some of the best horror i have seen in a long time. The direction is fantastic (considering this is a first time director who has absolutely no experience in the business) and the suspense created is as close to what Hitchcock came up with as i've seen. This suspense then gives rise to 2/3 excellent scares, quite predictable, but all the same terrifying. A brilliant and rare-nowadays originality is achieved accompanied by a unique yet impressively effective style. Unfortunately the movie goes seriously downhill after this and like nearly all horror films nowadays it fails in the second half. The writing becomes worse and worse and the movie begins to feel like a bad slasher, with all the old clichés. Liv Tyler's acting becomes obviously poor but most noticeably the scares just repeat themselves over and over again. The only plus point about the second half of the movie is that the brilliant direction obvious at the beginning is thankfully maintained and a sense of chill (similar to that in the original Texas chainsaw massacre)is maintained throughout, an absolute achievement considering the deteriorating writing. So overall worth a watch due to it's excellent first-half but i'm pretty sure you'll be disappointed with the rest of the movie. Good to see a new very talented director coming through though.",The Strangers

Then the puzzle quickly comes together. We get a little feel to them, not too much, just enough. Then the knock comes. They make a mistake 98% of us would have made and answer it. The night quickly turns into a very riveting tension ride with a reasonable number of scares. It has some horror clichés, but the thing is, they are believable.

Today there aren't movies that scare you, we've seen practically everything so people shouldn't come on here and bash a movie about how it's the same or that the characters aren't doing a lot. I agree with some people on here, its what could happen to anyone out in the woods. It probably one of the fears i have when i'm at home and its dark outside. One year my cousin was alone at his moms home and some thugs came to the house and were doing exactly what was going on in the movie. Mind you it was dark outside and there are big windows so it can happen. This movie was great! I loved it i enjoyed it to the fullest and i'm definitely buying it when it comes out!

It wasn't that it was gory or anything it was the suspense that got me. I find the director did do a great job not as a horror but a terror movie and they did that well. It was late at night when my husband and I watched it, and my mind started racing like leave the outside lights on, block the doors, make sure all the doors are locked etc. I can't even hardly bring myself to go to sleep. Thats how it played on my mind. I give this a thumbs up for a simple terror movie because it was so real and there is so much craziness going on, and so many home invasions for no reason.

During the whole movie, the strangers are spying the actors, playing with them, but always showing surreal behaviors. This movie could be solved in 10 minutes and they did a 90minutes movie, so terrible.When the movie ends, you feel like nothing happened, and that is true.

Classic mistakes being made by the characters; opening the door at 4 in the morning for a random stranger without asking who it is...leaving the house while you know someone's stalking you...not putting the car in drive to get away and letting the people stalking you destroy you car...running out of the house with the only gun into the woods instead of staying in your house...and finally not having a weapon on you at all times and not putting up a fight when you know your gonna die. The movie was well directed, I'll give the first time director credit for that, and for all the people out there looking for a well directed film with a bad ending, this is for you. I can understand the philosophy behind it, the nihilistic nature behind it, but this isn't a philosophy class, its a movie. The Dark Knight's Joker portrayed this type of character, but there was justice in the end and the character you root for lives. Even if the two characters do have to die in the end, at least provide it with some justice, like kill the people that killed them, or just let them be heroic and somehow get out of the mess. I mean the murders were like ghosts in the woods the whole movie popping up in different places all the time, and moving silently around the house and woods, and they turn out to be human, humans cant disappear in seconds in the middle of an open field! Maybe its just my strong appreciation for a good, realistic movie with a descent ending where the good guys don't make every mistake they can and come out OK, but this is ridiculous, they get chased around the whole time and then finally get killed with no reason beside you were home, and the it ends.

""So, let's tap into the primal angst of our society's double edged values, and get people to jump in their seats:Marriage might limit you - but who are you going to turn to when the going gets tough, and you're all alone?That cigarette might taste good - but good enough to let your boyfriend leave you home alone to pick up a fresh pack?You may not like violence - but would you really prefer not to know how to load and when to shoot a gun?you drive a Volvo, that's a good family protective car - but no match for a pickup truck""bleh!

If your looking to over analyze a movie and pay close attention to details than you may not like it. But if you want to be entertained, this movie will scare the crap out out you! One of the most chilling and creepy movies I have seen in years.Why do I like it? It has similar traits of my favorite horror movies of all time.1) It's believable. 2) Small time cast. I don't think there are more than 7 people in the entire movie. 3) It's Not overly gory. What scares you is what you DON'T see! 4) The bad guys are creepy 5) Scares you even when you know what is going to happen 6) Solid acting",The Strangers
776,a_burke2,Don't run. Don't Hide. The Strangers will still get you!,7,10 November 2008,"Terror and suspense. That's what you get in the strangers. The strangers is a suspense thriller about a couple who stay at a vacation home in the woods. They didn't know that there romantic night together would end after their home gets invaded. The Strangers stars Liv Tyler (Armageddon, Lord of the Rings) and Scott Speedman (xXx 2, Underworld) as they try to stay alive after three strangers come by and terrorize them all night long. This film is actually an American remake of the French film Ils or also know as Them in the U.S.The film starts out like an old classic horror movie. It makes you feel scared like what you don't see is even scarier. Everything seems fine in the home until the middle of the night when Liv Tyler's character Kristen hears someone knocking on the door. But no one is there. Throughout the night Kristen and her boyfriend James are on a cat and mouse chase to get away from the three strangers. I liked this movie a lot because I like getting scared and it kept me entertained through the whole movie.Overall I would give the strangers a 7/10 it's a great suspense/thriller and doesn't have much blood and gore if you are not into those kinds of films. Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman show a great portrayal of what it would be like if you had a home invasion. If you liked this movie you should definitely check out the original French film called ""Them"". It's basically the same plot but just with a different back story.",The Strangers

Thank you for reading our comments.. please please don't watch this movie.. it is a blunder..I don't want to say any thing,but to submit my review m copying someone else's comment... so don't read after this... thank youThe Strangers is a movie that delivers everything it promises it would. It scares you. Simple as that. Instead of relying on buckets of gore and an over-contrived premise, it keeps things simple and thats what makes it work. For an hour and a half, the viewer is subjected to a slowly mounting sense of dread that just keeps building without ever pulling back. The story never falls victim to the usual horror movie clichés, but at the same time , it doesn't make any ridiculous attempts to go against them. Perhaps the best thing that the movie has going for it is it's believability. There isn't really any thing to distract the viewer from buying into the premise wholeheartedly. Considering that this is the director's first ever movie, it's a feat that's even more impressive. This is the kind of movie you shouldn't watch at home alone in the dark.",The Strangers

In fact, I could have killed them all seventeen and half times over by then. Seinfeld was scarier. Dora the damn Explorer is scarier. Quit acting Liv Tyler and other pointless guy no one cares about.

If it weren't for some loud random noises this could just as easily have been a drama.

Why does the two main characters voluntarily go away from each other several times, just to create extra tension? The instinct in this frightening situation would be to flee or hide not to move around the same area all the time. The atmosphere in this movie could be much more scary if it hadn't been for the story. Liv Taylor does a quite good job though. The ""mormon"" boys in the end of the movie does not give a real impression at all. With so many good horror movies out there, why waste your time on this one. For a good horror movie look elsewhere.

I personally made the mistake of watching this at home in the dark on a some what cold windy night. I do however have a bone to pick with Mr Byran after the doll people have caught the couple and are slowly killing them its almost like hes trying to keep the rating to R16 he had an opportunity to make this movie a lot more gory. I also liked that the guy got rejected... it made the movie seem more realistic, its hard to have a happy ending in a movie that centre's around terror and horror but he made a silver lining to a very dark cloud in the end.

The whole idea that ""The Strangers"" are only killing the poor couple because they were at home was frightening and I know for a fact that's the reason most murders happen is because the killer is just some random psychopath who gets pleasure from killing. And this is what makes this film so intense. James and Kristen just happen to be in an isolated vacation home at the wrong time and three masked people torment them for fun before horribly stabbing them. And the only reason they give is, ""Because you were home"". I went to see this film at the cinema and I thoroughly enjoyed it and as soon as it came out on DVD, I bought it. People don't like the film because of lack of gore, yet I think the fact that this kind of senseless murder happens in real life makes this film more scary than the usual gore-infested horrors. This truly is one of the most under-appreciated films ever.",The Strangers
787,limegreensilk,Part of the General Public? You'll Hate It.,9,25 March 2009,"First off, let me say that I watched this movie about...oh, a month ago. I slept with an eye open and would have to look around to make sure nobody was standing there for about two days. Now, being a 'stupid teenager', my opinions are obviously less valid than adults who are scraping the bottom of the proverbial barrel of intelligence, if you catch my drift. This movie was not a slasher movie. There was not a lot of blood. There was not a lot of gore. These things do not make a horror movie. A horror movie, by my own definition, is a movie meant to be scary. Scary is not exclusively blood and gore. Are you afraid of spiders? How about roaches? How about people lurking around your home with masks over their heads--a red flag that they really don't want you to know who they are--making damn sure you can't call anyone, and standing right freaking behind you? The Strangers does not rely on gallons of blood and axes through the head to deliver a scare. It relies on the sheer terror of powerlessness and the fact that, as stated above, they don't know for a good, oh, hour or two (mind you, this is movie time, not actual time) that something is wrong. As for other people's comments about how it was unrealistic-- what would you do if you'd just blown your best friend's head off, because you thought it was a psycho freak who was messing with you and your girlfriend? Yes, the friend should have made noise. This I will concede. He was an idiot for not calling out, and probably deserved to have his brains splattered over the walls. Well, at least, a little bit. But, the boyfriend...aah, in his place, you would have probably done something like leaving your safe place, as well. The girlfriend is scared out of her mind, and is following him blindly. Why didn't they run, then, you say? Well, the 'Strangers' made it pretty damn clear that they didn't like that, not one bit. Were you absent when they nearly ran over them with the truck? Or when they smashed in the windshield while the couple was still inside? Yes, there were cheap 'shock' moments. Yes, there were flaws. But if you paid close enough attention, one of the creepiest things of the movie was the several times (I counted three) that at least one of the three Strangers were watching the couple, or the friend, without their knowledge. These were missed easily, and my mom, who watched it with me, didn't notice two of the three I saw. I had to rewind the movie and point them out to her.So, basically, if you're looking for blood and gore, go somewhere else. In fact, most people will hate this movie. It's sad that only a handful of people will appreciate this movie, because it was so much better than most of the junk that Hollywood is shoving our way.",The Strangers

Villainous characters come to terrorize and murder main characters for no (not even a remotely plausible) motive. Characters with big gun kill only a friend and are done in by villains with knives only due to irrational behavior which is consistent throughout this mish-mash.

Second, there is no plot. I mean, ANY movie major could come up with something better, or at least point at the GLARING plot holes that seems to infest this movie. The protagonists continuously make glaringly stupid decisions, and the antagonists fail to take advantage of those mistakes.

There is surprisingly little violence and gore in the film, yet you will feel wrung out by the end of it. Sound and silence is used with surgical precision and unnerving visual details along with a relentless building of tension make this a really great scary movie. Yes, there are things you can see coming a mile away...the fate of Mike comes to mind...yet it *still* works. Yes, I knew what was going to happen to Mike the second he walked into the house...but the terror comes in the very inevitability of it. Knowing that this character is doomed and why creates it's own tension. Very much like the absolutely brilliant ""crane shot"" in Rob Zombie's House of 1000 Corpses, knowing what is going to happen...and knowing that there's absolutely no way it's *not* going to happen doesn't in any way soften the blow when it lands. There are people who have complained because there's no elaborate explanations given for the evils that take place...that they never say why the masked figures are doing what they're doing. I say nonsense! This is not a movie for simple people looking for simple explanations. If you left this film feeling unsatisfied because there was ""no explanation given"" for the actions of the masked killers, then you just aren't getting it. Stick to watching reruns of Scooby Doo. The answer is given by the one of the Strangers...and all the more unnerving for it. ""Because you were home"". An act of sheer, nihilistic terror committed for it's own sake....for the simple joy of slowly destroying the two main characters without remorse and without any kind of ""greater purpose"" or justification.

I understand that oftentimes the victims of these crimes are innocent, but that does not discount the fact that the killers have some underlying mental issue that is causing them to act out in this gruesome fashion. To just make the statement that it is simply senseless violence makes the movie pointless.This movie is like going on a Haunted House ride at a theme park. It takes the viewer through a long, drawn out, series of scares and thrills to the final conclusion, which we already had assumed based on the disclaimer at the beginning.I have very high standards for horror films and this one fell way short as do most.

You have to watch this movie when you're in the right horror movie mood to get the full effect. It's the scariest movie I've ever seen. Maybe it's partly because it's ""based on true events"" (that line is used loosely), which makes it all seem more real. There's a constant mood to the movie that makes you feel constantly on edge. For being a horror with an R-rating, it's not as gory as you would expect, which is a nice change. The ending is really what makes a movie what it is, and the ending to this one is chilling.

806,safgev,"vote is "" -10 """,1,24 January 2012,"This is terrible film - without any meaning. Uncomplete and unfinished scenarios and actions during the film. Lot of not natural voices and blood. The main creators of this low-quality film are suffering with inferiority complex (this is my subjective sentiment). After watching this ""film"" i have some questions and advices to above-mentioned persons (team). 1. What is the aim of this film? 2. Have you ever seen in the real life such animals, who can kill without any reason? I think - no. It is impossible. 3. Why you are making such a disgusting films? There are lot of beautiful things and moments in the life that can be shown in the works of art . . .",The Strangers
807,syablon22,Great film! (maybe a spoiler or two below),9,18 April 2012,"I can't believe the negative reviews of this film. It is very tense, and scary. It's so great to see a contemporary horror film that is a departure from the usual format (annoying, attractive characters, no suspense just killing, etc.). I liked how a story was set up between the main characters and their relationship, but you never really get resolve, so a lot is left to the imagination. It makes them more real. The first sighting of the killers at the door was so strange and scary, and that line, ""Is Tamara here?"" Yikes! When they took off their masks so the victims could see their faces but we didn't, it was disturbing. From the direction to the acting and production design, this is all around great. My only criticism would be the last line by the killers to the boys they encounter on the way home, which was not needed. I am hoping the director's next horror film is just as good.",The Strangers
808,brittanyb7046,This was my all time favorite movie,10,24 June 2012,"What I've learned from hearing or reading feedback from this film is that when you watch it, you either love it, or you hate it. I'm a horror movie junkie. I rather watch them alone and in the dark to try and get that feeling of fear, but it rarely happens. I saw The Strangers in theaters and by the end of the movie, I felt so jittery and sick. My mind was all over the place. I have never had that happen to me. Ever. I could relate to the movie because I live in the middle of nowhere and I think that's what got me at the edge of my seat, and of course the little intro narrative got me.Anyway, I thought it was an overall great movie and I definitely recommend it. I say that it all depends on the person's expectations of the movie.",The Strangers
809,markastro-429-985935,Suspense Wrapped in Silence and That's it.,6,21 July 2012,"This film delivers what it promises in terms of a horror film. It's suspenseful and has those moments that make you jump. Of the last two decades it would have to be one of the best horrors that manages to send a slight chill up the spine of some of the more moderate fans of the genre, however for those who are hardcore fans, this film isn't worth the watch. I'll starts with the pros. The film is good at startling the viewer. It uses perfectly timed sequences of silence to lure you in, expect the bang, not get it then receive just seconds after you did. These perfectly timed sequences are well played off by the two stars of the film, Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman. The two do well in their respective roles. Also the set and costume design are flawless, and the eerie music used by the director and his crew adds a subtle undertone of dread that fills the viewer with that chill that I spoke of earlier. Also the killers are foreboding and sinister in their methodical approach to victimizing the two leads. Also the film uses modesty to it's advantage because it's not one of those blood fest gore induced teen slasher zombified crap that we've come to expect from horror films of late.This is all the film does well though. It continues on to fall for a lot of the genre's cliché and for those that know the genre you'll spot them coming a mile away. The film's silence is not only it's strongest point but also one of it's enemies. There is very little at the start to draw the viewer in, with time some would say wasted, developing a relationship between the two leads. This development is poorly done, uncompelling and not very believable. Also a lot of the sequences are boring with little happening on screen for the first twenty minutes of the film. There are also actions made by both parties that seem to have been put in to make the film longer perhaps and are just unnecessary.To be fair to the director it was his first film and each of the actors used in the consecutive sequences do well to help carry this film through to it's conclusion. There is also a rather tense sequence involving one of the supporting cast which does what the genre does best. Some have said that the actions of the two leads are unbelievable, but one has to remember that this film is based at four in the morning, after a wedding, in the dark of the night. Cliché I know but that's what it is.Overall though this film was a disappointment and was nowhere near as good as ""Vacancy"" and ""Funny Games"", films released at similar dates to this one, which do a much better job at scaring the viewer rather than startling them. This was a film so to being one of the greats, but simple mistakes and cheap jumps let the film down. That being said this film is still a much better example of the genre than most other films released in this genre of this century but is a long way of being memorable.",The Strangers
810,an7hrax,If Michael Bay directed films without CGI they would suck this much. (SPOILERS),1,30 August 2008,"i would like my entire post to just be ""WTF"" but that would be a little too short. I enjoyed balls of fury more than this trash, since when did wearing some crappy mask make you a ninja? your in a big open field and someones behind you, you turn around and they disappear from the entire freakin area!!! You get attacked with a baseball bat in a garage what do you do? CRAWL across the field.... what the hell? Not even worth mentioning the drunk friend who is clearly out of his face on crack because he doesn't notice the many many signs saying there's a killer about, or rather he did notice them but wouldn't be arsed to use his mobile phone!

811,weezerfanperson,Not one of the Friday the 13th's comes close to this.,8,9 April 2009,"Judging by the comments made, it seems that most of the problem people have with this movie is the lack of body count. This movie was amazing, if there is anything to criticize about it, it's using the same thing John Carpenter did in Halloween with the bright mask in dark shadows, so the audience can see what the characters do not. Seriously, I bet there's a good chunk of people that would at least check to see who would be knocking at 4AM, and the wrong house thing, that's happened to friends of mine at weird hours, mostly from drunks but this was a horror movie so we'll give them that.This movie used its elements very well, the woman screwing up her leg so she has to crawl, and The Strangers were not there just to kill them, they wanted to screw with them first. Make them feel fear. Personally, I think this movie was fantastic. I consider myself a horror movie nerd, I've seen them all, Halloween (my personal favorite), the Friday the 13ths, Nightmare on Elm St., Carnival of Souls, Descent, Vanishing blah de blah, and this one was really creepy.If you hated this movie, watch it again by yourself. The point of horror is to creep you out, not make you analyze the characters mistakes, if characters in horror movies didn't make mistakes THERE'D BE NO SUCH THING AS HORROR!",The Strangers
812,Elstred188,Lolwat,3,23 February 2013,"In this review I will tell about the pro's and the con's of the following move, ""The Strangers,""which is a basic horror film about a couple fighting in a home against villains, only without sex. I have to admit, there were a few scenes that made me jump such as the hand slam on the window. Blurry things like that creep me out. But some parts such as the Man with Sack staring at the girl were just plain stupid. I was hoping for a knife fight or at least the girl turning around saying ""I see you"" That's what I did and come lady told me to be quiet and not tease Mr. Sacky. Anywho this movie had a horrible plot, many ""y u do dat,"" scenes, and irrelevant scenes such at the two Christian children. Common scene was lost in this movie which made it terrible. Someone just threw a rock at my car, my friends car is destroyed, house destroyed, don't bother to look around, but I just really need to Holla at my homeboy. Really... I have a giant shotgun. I throw a chair instead. I see a girl by my car that is terrorizing my wife and I. ""Yes can you please leave?"" I walk and twist my ankle out of no where but don't notice a woman slamming her shoes into the ground behind me. I decide to leave my wife alone with no weapon while I try to find a radio with a shotgun I cannot even shoot. Yes. I would totally go into my slashed tire car instead of just running and finding the nearest house, building, police station, etc. I feel like taking your phone battery instead of killing you and your wife right away. You know why? Mr. Sacky is a troller. *Sigh* Is everyone an idiot in this movie besides Dollface. At least she taunts. Pop ups. Okay. Plot. Horrible. Fear. 2/10 Would I see it again? Lol yeah right.",The Strangers
813,grimm26,And Liv Just Got A Scream Award For This?,9,25 October 2008,"I watch a lot of films and very few of them are NOT horror or terror based. The trailers for this one looked promising and with Liv Tyler in it I was hooked. So wait I did, and surprised I was. Once again, I had been flammability by the clip artist who made the trailer. Yes, like so many before it, the trailer contained any bits of good stuff that were to come. I sat there and kept waiting for the fake whammy, to be followed by the real whammy, but got neither. There were so many missed opportunities, so many just almost there, but not quite. It was a good attempt but I was not scared, not terrorized, not wracked with tension. It wasn't as some others have said, ""believeable"", not unless the three victims had just had lobotomies.(""Halloween"" revisited) The most I can say about the three antagonists;They were poor versions of Stanley Kubricks ""Droogs"" from A Clockwork Orange. Sociopaths yes, but silly ones. Look, I'm not a film expert, or film student, I'm just Joe the plumber who watches films for entertainment, and if it doesn't entertain me it doesn't get any more of my money. I will say this, I understand that this is the directors first film. If this is true, then it's a good start, and I expect better and bigger things from him. It's not a BAD film, it just wasn't scary.",The Strangers
814,amylou_42,thoughts,4,21 October 2008,Don't waste your money. Wait for it to come out on cable. Very disappointing. We just watched it. We never got to see the faces of the bad ones. Not nearly as scary as it is advertised to be.The plot is okay but more could have been done to make this a much better film. What Ever Happened to Baby Jane beats this movie hands down. The Entity beats this movie hands down. I would even go so far to say that The Hills Have Eyes beats this movie hands down. We were prepared to have our selves scared witless and this movie did NOT deliver all that it promised. Maybe the second one when it is made will be directed and produced better.

815,iAlsoLoveBees,Are you kidding me? Worst of the year.,2,7 June 2008,"This movie, in a nutshell, is terrible. The first 20 minutes or so were good, and I'll admit, the part where the man in the sackcloth mask stares at Liv Tyler as she smokes was a little disturbing.After that however, it all went downhill. Entirely predictable. A review I read said they stalked in ""newly-unique ways"". If by that she meant cookie-cutter behind-the-blinds, around-the-corner, behind-you way, then yes, she was entirely right. Oh look a radio! Let me call for help! ""Hello! Yes, officer!?"" Oh no! The murderer broke the radio.I'm gonna cut this short, just like the movie was, and get to the point where I actually felt bad for the people who paid to see it.Liv Tyler, dead on the ground, Mormon child reaching for her, to either cop a feel or check her pulse (we'll never know), and AAAGH! she screamed! aaaaannndd credits roll...WTF? Nothing was explained the entire movie! ""You're home now"": unexplained. Use of masks: unexplained. Reasons for making this movie: unexplained.I sat through the credits, hoping that the end of the movie would be after the credits, but to no avail.In short:The Strangers was the longest trailer for a crappy movie I've ever seen. I have low hopes for the movie when it hopefully comes out in its entirety later this summer.**--------",The Strangers

The movie is incredibly stupid, characters act stupid, the killers are stupid, the ending is stupid and most of all, the movie sucks, because its really stupid. You probably ask why (if so then its wrong since you should forget this film ever existed), I will tell you: there are some super cool killers who like to scare people psychologically. Nice, nice. So, why do they keep repeating the same tricks over and over? Imagine, you're a super cool killer and you want to creep your victim breathless. So what do you do? Yep, you take an axe, start chopping through the door and then... you walk away. Oh thats creepy. Or you enter the room your victim is in silently and... you walk away even more silently. No way! I could go on, but you already wasted a few precious moments of reading about film that is complete crap! So stop right here and spend some time with family or do whatever makes sense for you! The only thing that was creepy was the introducing knocking on the door (sound of it was scary). You want to see a good horror movie? See Rec, that will teach you to be afraid!

There is no character development nor is there any real plot or reasoning behind the events that happen. In order to have a good horror movie you NEED to have motive, you need to have some sort of background and knowledge of why this is happening. Whether you find out during the action or at the end. It doesn't matter, but it needs to be there. If you look at any well known horror movie its there, this one.... nothing.

In all seriousness at the end of the movie although I enjoyed it I still wanted to know why and what and who in other words I had so many questions but no answers and felt rather confused untill I googled it then knew why.

820,steve-sargol,Love the slow burn,9,18 August 2018,I have had a soft spot for this movie for years. It just seems to hit the right notes. Frustration over the protagonists actions without being ridiculous. A slow build... love that. Antagonists that aren't supernatural. A total lack of teen douchebags you just want to see die. Decent acting. Well done visuals - gritty and real feeling. The premise of violence for no real good reason combined with the regret and emotional strife of the main characters make this a truly scary film.,The Strangers
821,zin-nicolas,Disappointed,4,21 November 2015,"I had heard great things about this film, so when I pressed play I did so with great expectations. But the film definitely did not live up. The first third of it is actually quite good. We get introduced to the characters and the director did create some good tension. But my problem was with the villains. THEY DID NOTHING. I mean, i get that they wanted to create some expectation, but the movie hits the hour mark before the so-called killers actually do something other than walk around the house and stare. The formula for this kind of horror movies has been done to death, so when a new one comes up, it should try it's best to be innovative and stand up, instead this one recycles old clichés with victims that run around from one point to another and killers that are less effective at scaring the audience than Doofy from Scary Movie.",The Strangers

There's not enough lines so that you even feel like it's a story, and in the end - two little boys ; described in the credits as ""Mormon boys"" ask if the killers are sinners and hands them a pamphlet. You guys really should do a bit more research- Mormons don't send little boys out with pamphlets asking if you are a sinner.

But I was pretty disappointed when the credits rolled by.Besides a promising premise it had some scary moments and good actors, so what went wrong really? Story-wise this was nothing special and at times very predictable as well as cliché. The ending felt like it's been designed as to give credibility to the false ""based on real events"" bull crap, and gave me a familiar bitter after-taste that's very reminiscent of the piece of trash Funny Games.I was utterly annoyed by the fact that everyone in the strangers gang could move like ghosts wherever they wanted in the actual house without alerting anyone(even walking behind a guy with him oblivious of the presence despite it being an old damn house!), and act in unison without seemingly any form of interaction in between each other.Not especially recommended overall, this brings nothing new to the table, except the premise of 3 masked strangers stalking your house, of which I believe a much better movie can be produced.",The Strangers

825,qwerty21,strangely scary,10,31 August 2008,"this movie i have to say was one of the most scariest movies in todays modern movies (apart from saw), with other stupid movies with ghosts and Bogey men and all the crap. when i first seen it i was quivering in my pants. i told all my mates the next day about how scary it was and that they should all go see it but looked at me with a ""yea right it was scary"" expression on their faces. the following week end one of my closet mates seen it and called me names for seeing it because now he was to scared to stay home alone at night. true storydo no listen to all the bad reviews given for this movie for people who wrote them and the reason i think they gave it bad reviews because they were expecting to get a crappy modern day scary movie and if you go in with that state of mind then that is what you get.the movie made me jump from the start and with the masked man appearing in one of the first scenes was amazing. for i was expect a build up of creepy music which i think is just old now, but there was no creepy music or no awareness of him coming into the frame, expect you get Liv Taylor. standing in her kitchen having a cigarette, when in the background a mask man appears in the background of the frame which gave me a chill down my spine. i thought that scene is one scene i will not forget next time i am home alone.the acting was fairly good, and gives you an idea of how people should acted when 3 masked strangers are terrorizing your home. the plot of the story was not that important and you don't really have to sit there and listen to get the gist of it.the over all movie was a brilliantly filmed and i don't think that it could of been done better. i a good movie to see with a loved one, for there will be many of times when you will be held tight with fear. this movie will make you check your locked doors twice. 10/10 for me.p.s PLEASE DO NOT LISTEN TO BAD REVIEWS",The Strangers

827,rurouni5580,Cliché and Underwhelming,3,29 May 2008,"Let it first be said that ""The Strangers"" is a great looking movie. The cinematography is gorgeous and claustrophobic. While not having a true ""hand held"" feel like ""Cloverfield"" or ""The Blair Witch Project,"" the camera is rarely held steady, it shifts in and out of focus, it moves dynamically during even relatively calm shots. It chases characters through the house, barn, and nearby woods.Other than that, ""The Strangers"" manages to be one of the most predictable and disappointing films I've seen in a while. The plot is very familiar. A young couple, who in this case happen to be a bit estranged, goes to a summer home in a heavily wooded neighborhood and prepares to spend the night. A strange girl comes to the door at four in the morning asking for a specific person. Her face is hidden in shadow and by the camera. She is turned away, then as the man runs an errand, the female half of the couple begins to become terrified, etc etc etc. . .The thing is, this movie has been made before, maybe not necessarily in plot, but the scares are all the same. There are loud noises, sudden glimpses of the three masked assailants, a creepy record player, and a chase through the woods. There is very little blood, there is no graphic violence, and at the end of the film, as one last cheap scare is thrown in, I had had enough. If you're looking for a great new horror film that revolutionizes the genre or a bloody gore-fest a la ""Hostel,"" then you're going to be disappointed sorely. If you want the same cheap thrills that have been in every horror thriller since ""Scream,"" then you will enjoy this film immensely.",The Strangers

835,gdeppe,Had Potential But It Fizzled Out Like a Cheap Firework,3,29 January 2017,"This movie will have you shaking your head and rolling your eyes in disbelief often enough to make you have to run to a chiropractor and then maybe the eye doctor! Talk about lame. The general story line had good potential, but the actions of it's main characters made absolutely no sense at all! One stupid, lame-brain decision is made after another. Many of these have been mentioned by others already. Starts off kind of OK, but then quickly goes off the rails. 1) OK, so some spaced out weirdo chick shows up banging at your front door at 4 in the morning and then disappears. Then, Liv Tyler's character runs out of cigarettes, so her boyfriend volunteers to drive a long way (these guys are out in the boonies somewhere) and leave her all alone (right after this jacked-up freak-show has shown up!) Ya, that's exactly what most of us would do, right? Don't think so. Remember, it's 4am, so couldn't she just go to bed and they could get some in the morning? Maybe she's a sleep-smoker, like a sleep-walker? 2) Lots of stupid, unbelievable things happen once we get rolling and all the wall knocking starts ... Liv's character runs into a bedroom and suddenly loses all brain function, not even knowing how to turn off a light switch on a table lamp. She frantically fumbles with it like she's got 10 thumbs. She finally smashes it on the ground, and in the process rips open her hand, leaving a bloody gash. Come on, really?! Later, when one of the intruders is axing in the front door Jack Nicholson style (was kind of waiting for someone to mutter ""Here's Johnny), a chair is thrown at the front door to stop them, as if it was a hand-grenade and would make a difference. All the while, they've got a shotgun in their hands! By the time they look down and realize ""Oh, wow, what is this? I think I've got something far superior to a wooden sitting device to use as a weapon against this hatchet wielding intruder who's obviously trying to harm me. Maybe I should use it?!"" By the time all of these brain synapses flow together and finally create a logical decision, it's of course too late. By the time the gun is raised and the shot is fired, the door wrecker has of course stepped out of the way for the wasted spray of gunshot pellets. 3) With her hand still bleeding from the table lamp debacle, Missy later runs from the house towards a wooded area, and as expected, trips and falls on her face. No, there was no booby trap, which would have made more sense, but she just simply forgot how to move quickly through space & time using her lower appendages. Totally understandable right? Happens to all of us. 4) Knowing full well that you and your partner are in dire straits and may very well be killed by these intruders, what do you think they do? Yup, he's going to go out to the tool shed to look for a ham radio, maybe wanting to get some alone time so he can listen to some tunes and bob his head? All the while, leaving his girlfriend alone in the house to fend for herself. Believable, no. Remember, this is the same woman who already fought a table lamp and the table lamp won. Her legs also got all discombobulated when she tried to run, so we can see where this is going. 5) Yes, and lest we forget, then there's the ""friend"" who comes to call to pick up his heartbroken buddy. He's totally clueless. Pulls up in his car at the end of the driveway, still dark out and suddenly a hole is blown through his windshield. That's his first clue to get the hell out. But what does he do ... nothing believable or sensible! He then approaches the house, noticing that his buddy's car is totaled and still smoking from having been torched, and there's a strange truck in the driveway which seems to have been used as a battering ram. He hears loud music coming from the house and ambles on in. He clearly sees that the house is a mess (and I don't mean a stack of dirty dishes and dirty laundry on the floor) and that there has obviously been a struggle. These additional clues don't seem to help him. Does he yell out his buddy's name? No. Does he go in all stealth-like, watching his back, knowing that some stranger(s) has/have declared war on both his friend's car, this house and maybe the lives of his pal and his girl as well? No. He just creeps on through the house, quiet as a mouse, assuming that he will not be attacked himself. All the while, the masked, asthma-ridden, wood-chopper dude creeps up on him. The friend is truly clueless. He never ever turns around, looking for approaching danger. Who does that? Little things like this add up quickly to cheapen the process and highly disappoint the viewer. Most who watched this movie likely blurted out to themselves or to their fellow watchers ""Oh come on! You've got to be kidding me."" Or maybe ""If you're that stupid, then you deserve to die."" On the flip side, the first bit of the movie creates some good suspense with its strange happenings. Looking at Liv Tyler for the duration of the movie is never a bad thing, what's not to like. Just a shame that she took on such a crappy role. This movie could have been oh so much better, especially if all of these ridiculous and highly-unlikely scenarios wouldn't have happened. To be truly enjoyable and memorable, a story line has to be believable, at least somewhat. I'm sure glad that I didn't shell out big bucks at the movie theater to see this. one, as I would have felt cheated.",The Strangers

837,jamgood-1,Pants!,1,29 August 2008,"Never before have I given a film 1 out of 10 but this film was bad. The Acting was terrible. Liv Tyler is inaudible throughout the film and extremely annoying. I kept asking my girlfriend what she said and she hadn't a clue half the time. Too much mumbling and when she should of screamed and shouted she was silent. Too weird.There's a few jumpy moments, very little gore (which I prefer, blood & guts does nothing for me but I do appreciate it when needed) and I think the film could of been 6/7 out of 10 with better actors in the lead roles.Great idea for a film ruined by the script, acting and pace. It was creepy but the slowness of it all got a bit boring. The music throughout the film was mostly enjoyable, being a music lover, I love soundtracks. The whole idea was pretty nerving and creepy and when it starts it's a bit of a 'what the hell is going on' but if you expect something interesting, fantastically scary or gruesome, you're left disappointed!Some folks will enjoy it but it's no piece of genius. I hope there's not a sequel.",The Strangers
838,joshbexley,One of the most suspenseful films I've ever seen - Possible Spoilers,9,28 May 2008,"As expected, The Strangers is not one of the best movies ever made, but it is crafted in such a way that will keep you on the edge of your seat and in an utter state of tension the whole time.Suspense is an effect used in a movie that does not typically last long. You have that rising tension and then a release of suspense in some climactic moment which leads to more plot release and an expansion of the story. Well, this movie is somewhat of an oddity in my opinion. You don't have a lot of those, ""Don't go back in the house,"" moments. Everything the main characters do seems to be right... seems to be. After every release of tension in this movie, you are immediately drawn back to a tense state. My body physically hurt after this movie due to the incredible amount of suspense and tension that I felt.There is just enough character development to make you feel for the main characters (played by Liv Tyler and Scott Speedman) in the beginning of the film. You don't feel cheated or that these are just two faceless people thrust into a bizarre situation. You do feel as if these are two very upset people who are in a very awkward situation to begin with. This only adds to that feeling of tension.It is hard not to say too much and ruin what is truly an amazing film to watch. If you want something that is almost more of an experience and less of a film, go see this movie. If you want something that will pull you in different directions and leave you checking your front yard before you go to sleep, definitely check out this movie. If you don't want to think that there really are people out there who would do just about anything.... then stay way.Overall rating - 9/10",The Strangers
839,benalpha127,"Overall quite a good film, but not great.",7,7 September 2008,"(Spoilers) I did enjoy this film The suspense created near the start while Liv Tyler's character is left on her own makes for terrific viewing, and there are a few moments in this film that definitely made me jump.I felt however that a good, simple horror film was ruined somewhat by an extremely long, drawn out and in my opinion boring Beginning and a poorly acted back story especially on Scott speedmans part.Make no mistake this is Liv Tyler's film, who certainly does a good job of appearing utterly terrified throughout.I did'nt quite believe Scott Speedman's character was hurt at his proposal rejection. and he simply does'nt do that much throughout the film, aside from shooting his best friend.I think this is overall a good film with a good if not Oscar winning performance by LIv Tyler and certainly moments that will scare you. What more could you ask of a horror film?",The Strangers
840,natet2000,Dumbest movie ever,2,31 May 2008,"First 30 minutes were the only good part about the movie. The ending was the worst I've seen in a suspense film. Don't waste your time seeing this at the theater. The plot is painstakingly obvious. Nothing against the actors, but I think this movie can only hurt their careers. I don't think the writers knew what they were doing when trying to recreate something that actually happened when there wasn't enough information on the actual event. If it were to properly be considered scary it definitely would need that kind of information. I think a little gore or something may have helped the movie. If you've seen a suspense film you've seen them all. If you just absolutely want to see this film, wait till it comes out on DVD and rent it. This is however a good movie to take a girlfriend to and let them freak themselves out.",The Strangers
841,double_o_resin,If you are a true fan of Horror.......,1,9 June 2008,"Don't waste your time with this one. This movie would be OK if I was in 7th grade again and on a date, Wait, no, I still wouldn't have liked this movie. It's starts really slow and just gets more lame as the movie goes on. I wouldn't even classify this movie as Horror, more like Romance/Drama/Horrible. I was kinda hoping to see the next great slasher movie and was let down. There were a lot of scenes in this movie that just don't make sense. I guess this just goes to show that giving someone a mask (Lame masks at that) and a knife to terrorize people doesn't always work. So once again if you are a true fan of Horror, wait for this one to come out on DVD and pick up fifth of your favorite alcohol and maybe you'll get lucky and pass out.",The Strangers
842,paulrgriffin,They Deserved It!,3,9 May 2010,"I mention that my review may contain some spoilers only as a courtesy, since this film is prespoiled already. Where to begin? First off, any decent slasher/horror film needs to get ONE fundamental issue right; make the main characters likable enough to actually care about. For example, the whole setup of the well meaning, but clueless doofus who plans this entire weekend to propose to his, well, let's face it, heartless ""woman"", only to get brutally shot down in the first few minutes or so in the film did not need to be there. If I was in that situation, that would be an instant goodbye and a fast cab ride out of there; end of story. But then we wouldn't have much of a film, now would we? Guess what? We Still Don't! Irony, anyone? So let's prolong this awkward moment by having a flimsy premise for these two losers to still have to hang out with each other long enough for three psychos to eventually show up. By the time the true mayhem starts, I'm actually cheering for the masked killers to get on with it! Even the Best Friend who looks like he's coming to the rescue is also an idiot who deserved to die. The way he gets taken out gives new meaning to the term, ""Poetic Justice"". The best line that would've actually tied this movie together near the end and possibly would have saved it is stepped on and crushed mercilessly; When the tied up ""couple"" are finally confronted face to face with their tormentors, and the female victim asks the question, ""Why us?"", the answer given is, ""Because you were home"". A far more chilling answer would've been, ""Do you really need to ask?"". This way, the couple's premise of the ""shot down in flames"" proposal situation could've been REALLY played up: make the woman REALLY horrid and heartless (which wouldn't have been much of a stretch), and the man REALLY pathetic (again, not a big stretch), and add that line at the end, and NOW you've got a film! Otherwise, just pick up the film ""Funny Games"", which is a far more entertaining, and way more chilling, kind of film. Same kind of premise, terrorized couple in house, etc., but executed in a vastly superior way.",The Strangers

845,musicman-95011,"Very, very, very suspenseful movie!",10,2 October 2018,"The beginning of the movie builds perfectly. I don't think I've seen a suspense movie that built up more perfect than this movie!
All 5e actors did an awesome job. The three ""strangers"" had me on the edge of my seat the whole time. It was a little predictable, but still a great flick! The music is very suspenseful. Also, the dynamics of the sounds were amazing! LOUD bangs, and crashes at unexpected times totally catch you off guard. 
You can't go wrong giving this one a go. If you like suspenseful movies, don't pass this one up!",The Strangers

847,carlgjohns,Strangely... awful.,1,21 November 2008,"I'm not sure exactly which particular audience this film was aiming for, be it Horror, Thriller or... well, what? It hit neither, even though it begged to do so. I'd say it tried to be an admirable attempt to build a sense of tension, but, it didn't. It left me cold, making any sense of routing for the main characters null and void. In fact, I wanted Liv Tyler dead within eighteen minutes of the drudgery that was the non-event of characterisation. Therein lies the problems. A heavy handed script that explained, ""Ooh, there's a relationship that's in trouble, but, well, not that much trouble"", but did not explain why the Director made you hate them. It wasn't intentional on his part, either. It was his ham fisted way of dealing with the script... which was almost non-existent. Bleak is occasionally cool... If you can pull it off. ""A L'Interieur"" follows the same structure, and tires you with it's relentlessness. But, with that film, even though you end up wanting to eat sweets and watch cartoons, just to wash the horror off your face, The Strangers just tends to make you want to sleep.",The Strangers
