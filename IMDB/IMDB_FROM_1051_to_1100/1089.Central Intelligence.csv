0,SnoopyStyle,fun chemistry when they're together,7,29 October 2016,"Twenty years ago, Calvin ""The Golden Jet"" Joyner (Kevin Hart) was voted the most likely to succeed in his high school. Robbie Wheirdicht (Dwayne Johnson) was the bullied fat kid who got humiliated by Trevor Olson and his friends. Now, Calvin is a simple accountant who gets passed over for a promotion. He's married to school sweetheart Maggie Johnson (Danielle Nicolet) who is more successful than him. With the upcoming high school reunion, he is friended by Bob Stone. It turns out to be Wheirdicht who gets him involved in an international espionage caper. CIA Agent Pamela Harris (Amy Ryan) reveals to Calvin that former agent Wheirdicht killed his partner Phil (Aaron Paul) and is the mysterious criminal Black Badger out to sell stolen satellite codes.Kevin Hart and The Rock have great chemistry together especially these two characters. It's a solid odd couple. Hart doesn't have to go crazy and he's actually more of a straight man in this coupling. The movie works great whenever they are together. The story itself is a mix of functional Macguffin with problematic details. It would have been great for the duo to have more time together.",Central Intelligence
1,Prismark10,Big Hart,6,9 April 2017,"Central Intelligence sees a high school fat kid Rob Wierdich who is humiliated at his last day in school being transformed into muscular but timid Rob Stone (Dwayne Johnson) who is now a CIA operative.Twenty years later and with a high school reunion on the horizon Stone hooks up with Calvin Joyner (Kevin Hart) the star student known as the Golden Jet and the only one who came to Wierdich's aid. Joyner's career as an accountant has not been as stellar that high school promised but Stone wants to use his skills to decrypt some financial transactions. The agency thinks that Stone has gone rogue and are out to get him.This is essentially a buddy action comedy. Hart is actually the straight man, leaving the light goofy comedy to Johnson. They make a good team but the plot is too formulaic and unadventurous. Still the offbeat characterisation from Hart and Johnson makes this film amusing enough.",Central Intelligence
2,nogodnomasters,He's got a banana,7,15 November 2017,"Calvin Joyner ( Kevin Hart) had it all at Central High School...athletic, drama club, and he married Maggie (Danielle Nicolet). Life as an accountant has been anti-climatic for him. He is contacted by Bob Stone (Dwayne Johnson) who was the bullied fat kid in school, one that Calvin, a ""snack sized Denzel"" helped during his worst moment.The film has action and humor. It is primarily a comedy. Hart and Johnson create good on screen chemistry. Could watch on tween family night.Guide: No sex. 1 F-word. Male butt nudity.",Central Intelligence
3,kosmasp,Between The Rock and a Hart Place,7,11 November 2016,"Although marketing went with something different (Little Hart, big Johnson) I do think they could've used this one too. If you like that and are amused by any or maybe even both those word-plays, the probability is high that you will also like the movie. I know I had a lot of fun with it. At times it just seems that the direction was, these are your characters, you're in a bar, now make it up as you go along ... AND ACTION! And it does work.Again if you are in the right frame of mind. This is supposed to be fun and while there are a couple of cogs in the machine and it does stutter from time to time (sometimes you could even say the movie seems to stand still), the overall flow is nice. Doesn't make a lot of sense, even if Kevin Hart is trying to create junction and some distance plus plays it as straight as possible. Still the two are funny and they make a good team together ... they can almost get away with any sort of joke. Even the silliest of them ...",Central Intelligence
4,Tweekums,A fun mismatched buddy movie,7,27 September 2018,"In 1996 two very different students were finishing high school; Calvin 'The Golden Jet' Joyner, a boy judged most likely to succeed; and Robbie Weirdicht, the fat kid whose life is made a misery by bullies. Twenty years later Calvin's life hasn't gone as expected; he is a midlevel accountant at a local firm... he is not planning to go to his high school reunion. Then he is contacted by 'Bob Stone', a man claiming to be a friend from school. They meet up and it turns out Bob is Robbie; no longer the fat kid but a towering man-mountain who swiftly deals with a group of bar-room bullies. Bob then asks Calvin to look at his accounts... it quickly becomes apparent that Bob is involved with some shady individuals... he claims to be after a man, known as the 'Black Badger' who is selling state secrets but soon the CIA turn up claiming Bob is the 'Black Badger'; Calvin will have to decide who he believes.This film provided a decent enough central plot which served up plenty of laughs. For a comedy the opening is a painful watch as we see Robbie humiliated in front of his school... of course this makes the inevitable payback all the more satisfying. Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart work well together as Bob and Calvin; two very mismatched characters. The humour is fairly varied; on the one hand we have Dwayne Johnson, wearing a unicorn tee-shirt, talking about his favourite movie 'Sixteen Candles' and how he identifies with Molly Ringwald's character; on the other we get some fairly crude jokes that are pretty funny but will put off some viewers. The action is okay but is clearly played for laughs rather than thrills. The rest of the cast are solid enough; especially Amy Ryan who played CIA Agent Pamela Harris; the woman after Stone. Overall an amusing action comedy with the emphasis on the comedy.",Central Intelligence
5,paul_haakonsen,Once a fat kid always a fat kid...,7,17 September 2016,"""Central Intelligence"" turned out to be a very surprising movie, and it was much more enjoyable than I had initially thought it would be. Granted, I had somewhat of not that high expectations given this movie stars Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart, but they most definitely proved me wrong.This movie is full of action, comedy and it kicks into fast pace right from the beginning and doesn't really slow down again until the end. There is a lot, and I do mean a lot, of funny scenes and situations with Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart. On the screen those two just make a wonderful match, complimenting one another hilariously.The story in ""Central Intelligence"" was actually quite good, it offered comedy, action and actually also had something for you to think about throughout the movie.The acting talents in the movie were well cast, especially Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart, both individually but also opposite one another. They really brought so much to the movie. It was also a treat to see Jason Bateman in the movie, despite having a fairly small role.I was laughing a good amount throughout the course of this entire movie, and I was more than genuinely entertained.I can strongly suggest that you sit down to watch ""Central Intelligence"", especially if you enjoy these action comedies that we sometimes see from Dwayne Johnson.""Central Intelligence"" scores a solid seven out of ten stars rating from me.",Central Intelligence
6,edwagreen,***,7,5 April 2017,"Hilarious film with a guy voted most likely to succeed by his high school class is shown 20 years later. Married to his high school sweetheart, an attorney, he is an accountant who is visited by a former extremely over-weight and vulnerable guy to criticism and bashing by others. The years have sure changed the guy. Thinner with terrific muscle tone, he is a CIA agent and as we come to realize, the most popular guy who feels that his life has been a disappointment, soon gets caught up in an espionage caper thanks to our now well-trimmed guy.The film is a good one as it becomes a guessing game on who is to be trusted or not. People come and go as far as suspicion is concerned and the usual chases are funny nonetheless.",Central Intelligence

9,oscaralbert,Warner Bros. warns American Youth that it really does NOT get better . . .,8,2 July 2016,". . . after high school--it simply gets a lot worse! That is the main message of CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE: No matter how many school counselors make big paychecks prattling pleasant platitudes that Real Life's going to be all Rainbows and Unicorns post-High School, kids need to know that these Feel-Gooders are only in it for the money, Warner warns. Though the National Teen Suicide Hotline made Warner tack on some gratuitous Happy Ending Plot Points, the CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE offered here is that the Fat Lady has finished singing by the time she pops you out. On the brighter side, Kevin Hart leads a trio of sure 2017 Oscar Winners among the CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE key urban cast members. Only the lack of a lead minority actress will prevent the Citizens of Color in this flick from duplicating IT HAPPENED ONE NIGHT by sweeping ALL of the acting statuettes. But now that most if not all of last year's despicable Oscar Voters have been replaced by Millennial Minority People, the only thing that can prevent #Oscarsoblack is a Trump Presidency!",Central Intelligence
10,neil-476,Good chemistry,7,23 May 2018,"The advertising banner for this film - ""A little Hart and a big Johnson"" - is both clever and funny, and suits this action comedy.1996 saw Calvin Joyner as the big star of his year at High School, and voted Most Likely To Succeed. It also saw fat nerd loner Robbie Wierdicht humiliated when bullies throw him, naked, into the final assembly: the student populace laughs at him, but Calvin compassionately lends him a jacket. 20 years later, Calvin has married his high school sweetheart and Homecoming Queen, but finds himself in a boring job as an accountant. When a Bob Stone contacts him for a get together on the eve of the school reunion, Calvin is surprised to discover that the fat nerd has changed his name and become superfit. He is even more surprised to discover that Stone appears to be a rogue CIA agent, especially when he becomes involved, very much against his will, in a caper which is fraught with danger.The chemistry between Kevin Hart as Calvin and Dwayne Johnson as Bob is very effective, as is borne out by the very funny outtakes which accompany the closing credits. Importantly, notwithstanding a couple of inconsistencies in Bob's motivations and behaviour, both characters are fairly believable: Calvin never goes over the top in writing or delivery, and Hart is commendably restrained.The story, though familiar, is quite strong, and provides excitement of its own as well as a good vehicle for the action, humour and character moments. There are laugh-out-loud moments in this - there is a role-play scene in particular which had the audience in my cinema all laughing, not to mention the taser moments - and the film is just plain likeable.There are two cameos which work well, the supporting cast are all fine, and the two principals have fun and perform well.In a film which is fairly clear of toilet humour, sex, and innuendo, there is a single ""f*ck"" included, as seems to be the fashion, because F*ck. I find this really annoying, because it adds nothing.That aside, this is an enjoyable buddy movie with some good laughs.",Central Intelligence
11,Uriah43,Life After High School,6,19 August 2016,"As a high school senior ""Calvin Joyner"" (Kevin Hart) has it all-he is popular, smart, athletic, adored by his pretty girlfriend ""Maggie"" (Danielle Nicolet) and has just been voted ""Most Likely to Succeed"" by his peers. ""Robbie Wierdicht"" (Dwayne Johnson) by comparison, is the high school loser who is terribly obese and is shunned and tormented by the other students. So badly tormented that on the last day of school he is dragged onto the basketball court totally naked in front of the student body so that his humiliation can be complete. Sadly, Calvin is the only person who feels any sympathy for Bob and even lends him his high school jacket to cover him. But life has a way of evening things out and 20 years later it is Calvin who is ashamed to go to his high school reunion because he feels he will be seen as a failure for not living up to everybody's expectations. Robbie, on the other hand, has been motivated by his treatment in high school and has not only buffed up but has also joined the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) where he leads a life of mystery and high adventure under the new name of ""Bob Stone"". Yet even then he is still ashamed and so on the night before the high school reunion he reaches out to the only person who was ever nice to him-Calvin Joyner. Naturally, being the nice guy that he is Calvin accepts Bob's invitation to have a drink and renew their acquaintance. But what Calvin doesn't realize is that Bob is currently involved in a severe case of espionage and that his life will never be the same afterwards. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this particular comedy had some genuinely funny scenes and both Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson played their parts exceptionally well. Unfortunately, the film was marred by unnecessary vulgarity along with a bad ending and this really affected the movie as a whole. Even so, the humor essentially carried the day and because of that I have rated this film accordingly. Slightly above average.",Central Intelligence
12,anaconda-40658,Zero in Brains.,7,1 July 2016,"Central Intelligence (2016): Dir: Rawson Marshall Thurber / Cast: Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Amy Ryan, Aaron Paul, Danielle Nicolet: Action comedy with a title that references heart. Dwayne Johnson plays Robbie Weirdicht, an overweight kid caught showering naked. During a pep rally to finish off the 1996 school year he is tossed by bullies out into the gym where his nakedness is met by laughter by all except one person. Kevin Hart plays Calvin Joyner, an accountant who is passed up for a promotion and feels that his life is going nowhere. He was high regarded in high school but became a hero to Robbie when he issued his jersey to cover himself up during the prank incident. He is married to his high school sweetheart but unsatisfied with his life. Robbie re-enters his life as Bob Stone who is seemingly innocent until C.I.A agents turn up looking for him. Calvin becomes mixed up in this when Bob thought his accounting skills to uncover codes. While the ending is corny the screenplay does a great payoff with regards to who is innocent and who is guilty placing viewers squarely in Calvin's position. Johnson displays some vulnerability as Bob whose tough in shape agent conceals emotional pain from yesteryear. Hart as Calvin demonstrates friendship but ultimately confusion when decisions rack up. Supporting characters are props including Amy Ryan as agent Harris, Aaron Paul as Bob's ex-partner in a predictable development, and Danielle Nicolet as Calvin's wife. Well made action farce with a message regarding bullying and its lasting affect as well as good deeds not forgotten. Score: 7 / 10",Central Intelligence
13,FlashCallahan,Snake Gyllenhaal......,7,23 June 2016,"Bullied as a teen for being overweight, Bob Stone shows up to his high school saviour, Calvin Joyner, looking fit and muscular. Calvin is a a fast-talking accountant who misses his glory days as a popular athlete. Stone is now a lethal CIA agent who needs Calvin's number skills to help him save the compromised U.S. spy satellite system. Together, the former classmates encounter shootouts, espionage and double-crosses while trying to prevent worldwide chaos......Kevin Hart is a wonder of cinema. When he has the right co-star, with the right material, his films are passable fluff (The Ride Along films). With the wrong material, and him taking over the film, they can be quite unbearable (everything else).So Kudos to him for letting Johnson hog everything and play against type as a Unicorn loving, fanny pack wearing CIA agent who is still a little bit touchy about an incident that we see in the beginning as a flashback.And if the flashback was the foreshadowing of the film, it wouldn't be as enjoyable as it is, because when we get back to the present, predictably the tables have turned for the two characters. Bob is now the one with the huge personality, whilst Calvin feels a little deflated in how his life has turned out since finishing high school.It's all been there done that narrative, but the two leads have chemistry, and the writers either had the sense to do proper comedy rather than rely on derogatory racial, sexual, and cultural humour, or they just just forgot.And in turn, it makes it just that little bit more refreshing than it should be.Yes, it features predictable comedy that you'd expect, like Hart trying to copy his friends CIA type skills, someone being shot and then whining about it, and of course, the bully from the opening being g played by a special guest star in the present, whom gets his comeuppance.For a film that has such lenient certification, it's pretty violent in a couple of instances, especially during a torture scene, and a fight that references a certain Patrick Swayze film.But for a comedy, in this day and age, not to be derogatory to some minority is an absolute bonus, as they don't need gimmicks to pull the audience in.If it's successful, I'm sure they'll be a less enjoyable sequel, but for now, I'll be chuckling to myself at when Hart walks away nervously from a car that's about to explode.Worth watching.",Central Intelligence

15,DKosty123,"A Spy Movie That's Really Funny, Along The Way",8,2 July 2016,"In a way, this movie is nearly a 10, because it is hard to imagine it being any funnier. When watching it the stuff between Johnson and Hart is so good that I have to hope they are going to do another movie with a script like this one. This movie is more fun than any film I have seen in a long time.Too often when WWF Wrestler's get into acting, their egos are so large, they can't transfer it into acting or comedy. Dwayne Johnson (aka. The Rock) does that transfer here. He shows he can act and do comedy with great skill at both and does not let anything get in his way. Kevin Hart does not hurt as the two of them with a full foot difference in height really seem to have this down. Their timing and pace are so good that I could not help laughing more than I have at a movie in a long time.It is almost hard at times to take the CIA spy plot seriously, but then every so often you get to wondering who are really the good guys and who are really the bad guys. The script is good enough to keep you wondering for most of the film. Centering around a 20 year high school reunion the plot works well. This one is worth checking out because it really lightens the mood and the supporting cast really backs it up too. Both Amy Ryan and Danielle Nicolet stand tall here despite being shorter than Kevin Hart. The Golden Jet and Bob Stone make this film funny, and the support and Thurber's Direction pace here are just about perfect. The running time of less than 2 hours is perfect and the inclusion of great pieces of the gag reel at the beginning of the credits made me leave the theater with a big smile.",Central Intelligence

17,KineticSeoul,It's one of those WHATEVER movie by the audiences,3,16 September 2016,"When it comes to spy team up comedy what makes it work is the partner to partner dynamic. The witty banters, clever executions and humorous set ups. I recently saw the spy comedy ""Grimsby"" and despite it being a very very crude movie, it's the better comedy. This basically relies on Dwayne Johnson to carry the movie, and just about all of this movies budget went to him. But even he didn't seem to care and had that expression of ""Gosh I am in my 40's why am I doing this? Well time to collect my paycheck"". The humor just seemed to fall flat with the constant over exaggeration and the jerk trying uber hard to be a jerk. I still give this movie a 3.8/10 because of it's message of being the hero of your own story. The team up this time is the lovable guy that got bullied all the way through high school and now is a butch and fit agent that knows how to kick ass. The other is Kevin Hart being well Kevin Hart. Basically a accountant that looks back on his glory days when he was in high school. The Rock seemed to have tried at humor with ""Pain & Gain"". In This not so much at all, he just seemed like he was winging it all the way through like I said. It's a very cliché, predictable and flat spy comedy. I would not see this again, it's one of those whatever movies. They need to put some more effort into it next time even if it's just a cash in.3.8/10",Central Intelligence
18,Hellmant,Probably the best Kevin Hart vehicle yet!,8,20 June 2016,"'CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE': Four Stars (Out of Five)An action-comedy buddy flick, starring Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart. It was directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber (who also previously helmed other hit comedy flicks, like 'WE'RE THE MILLERS' and 'DODGEBALL'). It was written by Thurber, David Stassen and Ike Barinholtz. The film costars Amy Ryan, Danielle Nicolet and Aaron Paul. It's a pretty funny movie, because of the pairing of Johnson and Hart, and it's also surprisingly touching (at times).Johnson plays Bob Stone; a once bullied (and severely overweight) nerd, that's now a lethal CIA agent. Calvin Joyner (Hart) went to high school with Stone; he was really popular, and helped Bob out during a traumatizing incident. So Bob has idolized Calvin ever since. The two meet for drinks, the weekend of their high school reunion, and Calvin gets pulled into a life threatening CIA adventure.Johnson and Hart have beautiful chemistry together; it really is a classic odd couple pairing! That's the highlight of the movie, but it also has a lot of heart; and a strong message about bullying. It's definitely 'forced' and 'clichéd', but it's also (surprisingly) emotional. I really enjoyed the movie, for that reason as well. The plot, and action scenes, are routine (and forgettable), but the character development is awesome! It's probably the best Kevin Hart vehicle yet!Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/- KJTB5KGois",Central Intelligence
19,thesar-2,Between The Cock and a Hart Place,5,24 July 2016,"Thank goodness Kevin Hart always co-stars with superior people to carry him through any project. Will Ferrell, Ice Cube, The Rockall actors who can rightfully steal any scene from Hart. But, it really doesn't take much.I do think Hart is funnythough he's just so middle of the road, always borderline homophobic and plays the same character. Luckily, this go- around, he had the incredibly more interesting and fun-to-watch, THE ROCK.The Rock is someone who is so unbelievably charismatic and really built as one, it's hard to dislike him in ANYTHING. Here, I liked him a ton. I really liked his character throughout. So, when Hart normally gets upstaged, I barely even noticed him this time.As for the movieIt's enjoyable and funny at times, but like Hart, it's so middle of the road. There is absolutely nothing new here. The plot is 30 years old, the action, though good (best scene is in the bar, early on) and the twists easy to figure out. Thank goodness, again, for The Rock who saved us – and the movie – once again.After an amazingly awful, unfunny and terrible prank at the end of a high school year, victim Bob betters himself, joins the CIA and gets framed. He needs the help of the only person that showed him mercy during the prank to solve the case. Two things, ah-hem, stick out here. Number one, I am not sure if we, the audience, were supposed to laugh with all the assholes in the high school during the prank. The movie sets it up that way; the kids laugh, the administration does nothing, no one's held accountable and even the Principal carries on as if nothing happened. Yes, this is a comedy, but come on. That's so incredibly criminal, it's nowhere near funny or plausible.And second, the ending was so incredible awkward and just as unreal as the opening. No spoilers, but I'd like to say I understand why he did what he did, but no, there is no reason. It was dumb and went on for far too long.That all said, again, with The Rock's help, his own humor and likability and some of Hart's jokes that worked, it's a slight recommendation. ***Final thoughts: Notice how I didn't mention the prank's details? Because I don't want to spread that hate and bully tactics. The movie ""tried"" to show retribution in the closing, but it was weak by that point. Mercifully, there's the bar scene early on that really worked. Quick, obvious and predictable, but satisfying.",Central Intelligence
20,FeastMode,my notes,3,30 June 2019,"This movie just wasn't very funny, which is sad because I love Kevin Hart and I think the Rock has been funny in other roles like in Pain and Gain, and Be Cool. So it was pretty bad that I didn't think the Rock's character in this movie AT ALL. I don't think I laughed at one thing he said. Kevin Hart made me laugh a few times. But left me quiet a bunch of other times he was trying to be funny. The supporting cast was not funny at all, especially Kevin Hart's coworker in the office. And when they tried to get serious and give the story some meaning and depth, it was just so lame. I probably would've given it 2 stars if it wasn't for that (1 viewing)",Central Intelligence
21,bowmanblue,Not even nearly as bad as I feared,7,31 July 2018,"Despite being a die-hard fan of Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, I didn't bother watching 'Central Intelligence' in the cinema. I just didn't like the look of it. It just came across as yet another tired spin on the 'mismatched buddy-cop' genre and probably all the best jokes were the ones featured in the trailer. However, after watching it, I'm actually quite surprised at how good it was. Actually, it is just another example of a 'mismatched buddy-cop' film, but, seeing as it had laughs and a high-entertainment factor, who cares? It was fun!The film opens twenty years ago during a High School finishing event where star quarterback (Kevin Hart) helps fat loser (Dwayne Johnson - courtesy of either one hell of a 'fat suit' or CGI effects) during some extreme public humiliation. Skip forward to present day and The Rock is now a super CIA agent and Kevin Hart works with spreadsheets. However, the pair meet up and inadvertently have to stop a major conspiracy from doing those dastardly things which will probably topple governments... or something. Do you care? Like I say... it's just fun.So, take one generic genre, add one generic plot and you may not be left with much. However, the charisma of the two leads elevates it to a great time if you're into some light-hearted entertainment and you're not expecting much. The jokes land and you won't care about the story much, as there's plenty of over-the-top action to allow Johnson to do what he does best.A couple of unexpected faces show up (unless they're featured in the trailer, or marketing in general - however, if you're like me and didn't know too much about the film - their inclusion was unexpected). And, as a massive fan of 'Breaking Bad' I would have liked their representative to have been in it for little more than just his extended cameo.There's not that much more to say about 'Central Intelligence.' If you're looking for something funny, easy-going and you're a fan of either/both Dwayne Johnson or Kevin Hart then you're going to have a good time here. On the other hand, if you're in the mood for something deep, meaningful and will blow your mind for its originality then you won't find any of that here.",Central Intelligence
22,ThomasDrufke,Fanny Packs,6,24 June 2016,"I was sold into the Kevin Hart/The Rock dynamic long before the movie was released and I'm down for plenty more collaborations. Unfortunately, the against-type characters they play get lost in a spy story that takes itself a tad too seriously.Central Intelligence takes a slightly more serious approach to a 21 Jump Street type of story with some fanny packs, unicorns, and surprising cameos added in. Although I haven't always been a big Kevin Hart fan, I really enjoyed him playing the straight man to The Rock's unpredictable-CIA agent. Again, with it balancing the fine line of being a stupid comedy to a serious one, Hart doesn't get to ramble off into stand-up comedian mode often, but when he does, the jokes definitely hit for me.On the other-hand, The Rock is probably the best thing this film has going for it. Much like Hart, I enjoyed watching him play a more guarded bada** than he does in the big action blockbusters. There's plenty of built up emotion underneath his characters' anger due to him getting beaten up as a high-schooler. The spy-comedy is structured around the 20-year high school reunion both of them are set to attend, and I think that's one of the areas where the film slips a bit for me. It's not that I didn't enjoy the fun cameos of former classmates, but it's where the film veered into something more silly. I would have been fine if the film went all in Jump Street and poked fun at itself, but there are plenty of times the film does take itself more serious than it has a right to.The film also has a tendency to be overly predictable. Right from the get-go there are certain scenes that you know will come back to have an impact on the story in exactly the way you would think, and they do. Again, predictability doesn't always mean a fault, but when the movie isn't all that great to begin with, it can be bothersome.

He gets in touch with fellow high schooler, Calvin, played by Kevin Hart. Calvin was voted most likely to succeed, but is stuck at a boring job. He meets Bob for drinks and is shocked what he's turned into. Even changed his name. Other CIA agents are after them, thinking Bob has turned treason. They solve the case but still have the 20 year reunion to go to. Both of them get all the attention and Bob meets his high school crush, Melissa Mccarthy.FINAL VERDICT: OK, had some funny pars, but not the Rock's best comedy.",Central Intelligence

It seems that the director just kept telling them, ""That's funny. Do it again. Do it again. Do it again."" It's a one-joke movie and they stretch the plot thinner than a T-shirt worn by The Rock.

25,lesleyharris30,"Mega Fun with Great Chemistry Between its Two Leads,",8,7 July 2016,"Central Intelligence is a great movie with a well developed plot and a terrific comedic cast. It's a fun, mindless comedy action that you can switch off from reality while watching and have a good time, there are many side splitting moments and even parts that had me at the edge of my seat. The writers did a great job of making us care for these characters before they set off on their journey, which helped out in the long run. However, the pacing was certainly slow, it was not as action packed and intense as the trailers made it out to be, there's a lot of slower moments, even times where I was begging for some plot development instead of mindless comedy. The cast are terrific, Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson shine in the lead roles and their chemistry is the film's highlight, they are joined by a stellar supporting cast that includes Amy Ryan and Aaron Paul, as well as a few brilliant cameos. It also deserves credit for switching roles and getting the lead actors to do something unexpected of them, putting the well known comedian, Hart, in a straight role and putting an action star, Johnson, as the flamboyant, over the top character, this differentiated the movie, making it more interesting. Though it may not be as exciting as the trailers made it seem, Central Intelligence is simple fun, and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good action or comedy. An accountant gets himself in trouble with the law after reuniting with an old high school acquaintance looking to prove his innocence. Best Performance: Aaron Paul",Central Intelligence
26,CuriosityKilledShawn,Intelligence is in short supply,4,26 June 2019,"I remember enjoying this the first time I saw it (oddly, exactly three years ago to the day) at the AMC in Burbank but the second time around it did not have much charm.Dwayne Johnson plays a fat, bullied kid all grown-up into a CIA hardass but still retaining his teenage insecurities, with Kevin Hart his only friend who stood up to the bullies in his defence. It's a sweet dynamic and enough to make a movie out of on its own, but they try to make it exciting by having a dreadful spy plot and lots of pathetic action scenes that involve nothing more than people shooting and missing. It's so not committed to making the action memorable that when Johnson confronts a motorcycle assassin in an old warehouse the movie just cuts away to a different scene and it's never mentioned again even though they spend time establishing this guy as a credible threat.The quieter scenes are where this movie works best and even then the humor is already become quite dated despite 2016 being not that long ago. It relies too much on camp and stupidity, which is even more grating in the extended version as the extra running time is nothing but the lead actors ad-libbing out of control. It's not funny at all.A good idea was wasted with this movie. It looks cheap, it's badly directed, and in ten years, even five years, time it will be completely unwatchable. Johnson and Hart are capable of much better.",Central Intelligence

He was a great athlete, student and friend, nicknamed the ""Golden Jet"". On the other hand, classmate Bob (The Rock) was overweight and the butt of most jokes. On the day of a closing ceremony in the school gym, bullies pushed Bob onto the floor straight from the locker room showers. Only Calvin helps out by offering his letter jacket to cover Bob as he exits the place. Flash forwarding 20 years, Cal has married the most lovely girl in the class, Maggie (Danielle Nicolet) and is a staid accountant. In part, he feels ashamed for he aspired to higher ambitions. As the twenty year school reunion is approaching, Calvin is startled to get a Facebook invitation from Bob. Agreeing to meet in a bar, Calvin is astonished to see Bob is a lean, mean, fighting machine, tall and full of muscles. Not only that, Bob is a CIA agent who needs CALVIN'S help to find accounting trails of a big criminal he has been trying to take down. Flattered, it turns out to be more than paperwork, as Calvin is soon involved in gun battles way over his head. Not only that, but a tough lady agent wants Cal's help to bring Bob down, as she says BOBBY is the bad guy here. Who can Cal believe? Will he live to see it matter? This fun, somewhat-mindless flick is a good yukfest for those who truly need to ""get lost in laughter"". Hart and The Rock make a great duo, not only in size difference but in styles of humor. Nicolet is very beautiful while the rest of the cast is nice, too. (Watch for a cameo from someone special). It also sports nice costumes, venues, and sets. No, its not going to bring home a dozen golden statuettes. But, who cares? Therefore, slip out some evening soon to send the blues miles away.",Central Intelligence

The Rock really lets his comedic side show and Hart does a great job playing, essentially, the straight man in this movie.

29,capone666,The Vidiot Reviews...,6,18 September 2016,"Central IntelligenceHigh school reunions are a great opportunity to rob the homes of your former classmates.Unfortunately, the alumnus in this action-comedy chose the right side of the law.Athletic and academic all-star Calvin (Kevin Hart) is having a hard time accepting his adult existence as a boring accountant. But all that changes when the fat-kid from his graduating class, Bob (Dwayne Johnson), shows up fit, claiming to be a CIA agent tracking a master thief.Things get complicated when a second agent (Amy Ryan) appears arguing that Bob is actually the master thief they are after.While it is yet another buddy-comedy for Hart, what sets this clone apart is its inclusion of Johnson as its comedic half. More than capable of keeping the far-fetched script on-track, he also makes his outlandish character work.Moreover, telling your old classmates you're a spy is cooler than telling them your childless.

30,The-Sarkologist,Entertaining - but that's it,5,2 July 2016,"Well, here's the deal – we have the film beginning on the last day of high school where Calvin Joyner is voted to the student most likely to succeed, while Bob Stone (not his real name) is in the shower dancing. Stone is then grabbed by some bullies, naked, and thrown into the middle of the gym, where all the school is watching. Everybody, but Joyner, is laughing at Stone, however Joyner gives Stone his jacket, and that is basically the last anybody hears of him.Twenty years later Joyner married his highschool sweetheart and is working in a dead end job at an accounting firm with an inflatable gorilla out the front. The idea of him succeeding seems to have fallen flat on its face, particularly when he found himself in the real world. However he receives an anonymous friend request on Facebook and discovers that it is his old friend from school, however he has changed – a lot. Instead of the fat kid he remembered he is now and incredibly muscly, yet still very nice, Dwayne Johnson. Stone is actually needing some assistance, which Joyner gives him, and it soon becomes apparent that Stone is a rouge CIA agent, and Joyner is now caught up in a mission to save the United States, which includes a huge machine gun fight in his office.So, that is basically the movie – it's funny in parts, but the comedy pretty quickly wears off to become not so much your typical spy action movie, but rather a somewhat unbelievable spy action movie. When I left the cinema I thought to myself – yes, this was a good film, however as I thought about it (though not too much, because there is nothing all that much to think about) I realised that there really wasn't anything all that special about it. While Johnson's character wasn't bad, or irritating, he just seemed to be a little too nice, to the point that I didn't feel that there was all that much depth to the character. Sure, there were some amusing scenes, but it wasn't a side splitting funny type of movie.I guess it is basically one of those 'life didn't quite turn out as we expected' type of movies – the ones where at the end of highschool it seems as if the world is your oyster, but twenty years down the track all the potential that was there when we were young seems to not only have gone, but has been wasted. In fact Joyner doesn't even want to attend his reunion (I know what it is like – I didn't, despite the fact that Facebook as allowed me to connect with my old school friends) because he feels that the expectation that was there were he was left has been wasted. Mind you, it is also one of those 'wouldn't it be good' type of movies – the ones that suggest that it would be good if something were to just suddenly happen to take the monotony out of life.Even though it was enjoyable, and I would hardly call it boring, it seems to suffer from the malaise that many of the Hollywood movies seem to be suffering from these days – lack of depth. Oh, and it is also predictable as well – I worked out that there was a purpose for the giant inflatable gorilla almost as soon as I saw it.",Central Intelligence
31,Reno-Rangan,Twenty years is a big gap for a big change to happen in anybody's life.,6,4 October 2016,"This film had the potential to be the best comedy of the year, it opened so well, but did not conclude on high. Like everything suddenly halted, the story came to an end with giving clichéd reason. Though the actors were amazing, and many jokes were awesome. The lead two combination was among the best Kevin Hart worked so far like in the recently with Ice Cube and Will Ferrell.The opening scenes set off the tone for the rest of the film. Twenty years later, an adventure begins, but that part was so familiar, except the influence of the opening part that carried till the final scene. Even though slightly unpredictable scenes, because the diversions were neatly done against what viewers could expect. The focus was largely on the lead pair, so theirs undertaking was kind of faded away.There's a guest role at the end, also some behind the scene clips during the end credit cheers us. I think it is a good comedy than it looks, but definitely not the best. Its not the narration, but the actors that makes worth a watch.

32,sol-,Force Multiplier,6,17 December 2016,"Reconnecting with a bully target from his high school days, a former prom king gets more than he bargained for as he finds out that overweight kid he once knew has transformed into a body-building rogue CIA agent in this action comedy starring Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart. The film plays the odd pairing of its two stars for all that it is worth and both are fun to watch, especially the solidly built Johnson who keeps varying zanily between macho tough guy and unicorn-loving free spirit. The script throws some ambiguity into the air as to whether or not Johnson is a traitor and while there is never really much doubt about him, Amy Ryan does at least carve an interesting character out of the agent tracking him down whose true motives remain elusive throughout. The film also has some very good action scenes. The laughs are, however, very much hit and miss with tiresome anti- bullying messages often getting in the way. On this note, Jason Bateman is disappointingly wasted in a one dimensional performance as a man who gave Johnson grief in high school. The espionage back-story is also a tad too complex for its own good; sure, the codes represent little more than a McGuffin, but any sense of urgency is reduced as a result of this part of the film never being properly developed. For such a flawed film though, it is remarkable how much of 'Central Intelligence' actually works. There is a very funny therapy session in which Johnson goes incognito and bananas (force multiplier!) as well as failed black flips make for surprisingly good running gags.",Central Intelligence
33,Floated2,Carried by its leads,7,6 November 2017,"Central Intelligence is clearly a comedy film which was intended to have box office success due to its leads of Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart. The film did well at the box office mainly due to them. The trailers did make it somewhat appealing yet also quite odd or bizarre. The comedy in this film is typical, there are some decent jokes and some misses that are not as funny as it could have been. Though what makes the film better than it should have been considering the recycled plot and predictable format, are Johnson and Hart, as their chemistry excels and they are both great entertainers. Central Intelligence blends both comedy and action and keeps it up but at the same time, feels quite bizarre and unrealistic at times with its over the top action.

34,eddie_baggins,Hart misses the mark again,4,19 February 2017,"For a comedian who has yet to show good form in feature films, Kevin Hart is certainly laughing all the way to the bank, as the hugely successful American stand-up comedy master has yet again with Central Intelligence hit pay dirt, even though his feature length material fails to add up to anything more than an experience that provides a few chuckles but missed the mark badly in concerns to story and hearty, memorable laughs.After big roles in films like Grudge Match, Ride Along, About Last Night, The Wedding Ringer, Get Hard and now this film, Hart is stringing together quite the list of mediocre films that have failed to capitalise on whatever charisma the performer seems to possess that has made him such a drawcard in the American marketplace.Whereas comedians turned movie stars like Eddie Murphy and Adam Sandler found initial success in their transitions to the big screen, Hart is walking a tricky line of never achieving the success many of his counterparts have found with their films that still manage to entertain to this day and not even the teaming up with Dwayne Johnson here can bring out the laughs like it could've.No stranger to hitting comedy high notes and seemingly a fan of partnering with Hart (the two performers will next be seen together in the Jumanji remake), Johnson gets some easy laughs as high school fat kid turned Jason Bourne like super spy Bob Stone who reunites himself with Hart's one time High School kingpin turned sad-sack accountant Calvin Joyner but Dodgeball director Rawson Marshall Thurber never finds the right balance needed to make Central Intelligence truly take off and while the film even tries its hand at some uneasy action sequences, even at 100 minutes Central Intelligence feels like a joke that wears out fast, after the initial funnies of The Rock with a bum bag and unicorn t-shirt wears off.Appealing to the somewhat low common denominator that modern comedy audiences have sadly come to know and love, Central Intelligence isn't the worst comedy you'll watch this year but it's still a long way off being much more than a background diversion, future TV re-run big shot and another forgettable entry into the increasingly disappointing Kevin Hart feature film catalogue.2 Sixteen Candle screenings out of 5",Central Intelligence
35,leonblackwood,Light-hearted fun but it could have been better! 5/10,5,5 November 2016,"Review: I must admit, I did have high hopes for this movie, mainly because the last couple of Kevin Hart movies did make me laugh but I did find a lot of the jokes in this film, quite weak and it was a bit weird watching Dwayne Johnson, make a fool out of himself. Kevin Hart is playing the same type of role that he does in a majority of his movies, so his performance wasn't surprising, and the storyline wasn't that bad, even though it seemed pretty far fetched. At a young age, Dwayne Johnson (Bob) used to be bullied at school, and after an embarrassing moment in front of the whole school, he is helped by Calvin (Kevin Hart) to escape the terrible moment. Many years later, Bob sends a Facebook friends request to Calvin, who accepts the request and meets him for a drink at a bar. The following morning, after sleeping around Calvin's house, a bunch of CIA agents turn up at the house, saying that Bob has some secret codes which can destroy earth. Bob then goes into hiding but as he doesn't have any other friends, he goes to Calvin for some help, which eventually drags him into Bob's undercover life as an agent. With there life's in danger, they try to find the truth behind the codes but Calvin is constantly questioning Bob's innocence, because of the information that he is given, from the CIA. The storyline is pretty easy to follow and the chemistry between the main characters is believable but it seemed more silly than funny through most of the film. You do get to see Dwayne Johnson in a different light and the ending is quite emotional but it good have been better, if the Rock was only acting like a brain dead idiot, just to get the codes. Anyway, it's light hearted fun with some funny moments but it did seem like Dwayne was over acting most of the time. Watchable!Round-Up: Dwayne Johnson, 44, was way out of his comfort zone in this movie but at least he is trying to cover other genres in his career. I think it's about time that Kevin Hart starred in a serious movie, because his comedy is starting to get on people's nerves and it's becoming repetitive. Anyway, this movie was directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber, 41, who also brought you Dodgeball, the Mysteries of Pittsburgh and the funny We're the Millers. For his 4th movie in the directors chair, he certainly done well, in terms of profit and with the Rock being highly in demand right now, he was lucky to get such a great cast. At the end of the day, this is just light-hearted fun, that really isn't meant to be taken seriously but it does take some time to get used to watching the Rock, out of intelligent, super hero mode.Budget: $50million Worldwide Gross: $217millionI recommend this movie to people who are into their action/crime/comedies, starring Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Amy Ryan, Danielle Nicolet, Jason Bateman, Aaron Paul, Ryan Hanson and Tim Griffin. 5/10",Central Intelligence

Meanwhile an obese guy called Robbie (played by Johnson)was bullied in school and was made fun of. Fast forward 20 years later and now Calvin is a down on his luck accountant who gets a mysterious invite on FaceBook from a guy called Bob Stone who wants to catch up with Calvin. Little does Calvin know is that Bob Stone was the obese kid at his high school 20 years ago and he is now working for the CIA and is tracking down the black badger. So Calvin and Bob go off on a crazy action packed adventure to find out who is black badger and clear Bob's name. But could Bob's former partner in crime have anything to do with this?Overall I seen this today in the cinemas and quite frankly I really don't know what the critics are saying about it. It was funny and I thought both Dwanye and Kevin had great chemistry as the oddball accountant and the former nerdy loser who was made fun of his weight Robbie.Now I am gonna tell you the good and the bad.Good: The humor was funny and the two main leads was great. Kevin Hart reminds me of Chris Tucker right down to the mannerisms.Bad: The story seems to rip off The Heat which starred Sandra Bullock and Melissa McCartney(who makes a brief cameo in Central Intelligence)and it gets kinda predictable too.Also Dwanye Johnson is a fairly descent actor but his smile is so forced.But still I had a great time watching this with my brother who also laughed at Kevin Hart's references from Sixteen Candles to Taylor Swift even Twilight and Face Book gets mocked in this film.Zootopia's Jason Bateman also makes a cameo as the boy who bullied Dwayne Johnson's character as a kid. 7/104/5,Central Intelligence

It was hard to believe that someone like The Rock is a die hard fan of unicorns and the 80s movie Sixteen Candles, but Johnson only proves his talents.It was more surprising how Johnson carried this film on his very big shoulders being the screwball side of this comedic duo. Most importantly, we do get to see the Rock kick ass and take names (while wearing a fanny pack, but...) He's action, He's comedy, And I can definitely smell what he's cooking. And if the Rock is not enough for you, Kevin Hart is in it too. One of the funnest men in movies today.

40,jtindahouse,Lack of chemistry hurts it,6,18 July 2016,"The smallest man in Hollywood teamed up with the largest man in Hollywood. Sounds like a recipe for success, right? After all 'Twins' in 1988 starring Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny DeVito was considered a hit. The problem 'Central Intelligence' faces is that its stars have almost zero chemistry together. They are purely working as individuals. A film can still survive with its stars doing that, but it does take a lot of quality away. Kevin Hart is his usual self, trying to be the life of the party and doing his best Chris Tucker impersonation at the same time. Every movie he's in seems to be almost the same performance these days. Does he have more levels to his acting ability? I'm starting to doubt it. Dwayne Johnson on the other hand gives a fairly solid performance. He had layers, with his character changing motives many times throughout the film, and he pulls them all off. He was still lacking the comedic timing that a professional funny-man would have nailed, but his enormous physique also lets him pull off jokes that others could not get away with. Sadly though, both are acting purely on their own and never manage to feed off each other. Luckily for them the script is actually quite strong and well-written which covers a lot of this up. There are some quite good action scenes and the story actually has some genuine mystery and suspense to it at times. There's a tremendous amount of nods to the audience to look out for (one from Aaron Paul of 'Breaking Bad' is particularly noticeable) and some unexpected cameos that work in quite well.

And I hope it is not the last, because they make a great team. The movie starts 20 years in the past, when Dwayne and Kevin are in high school. Dwayne is an over weight dorky kid and Kevin is Mr. Popular. An embarrassing prank is pulled on Dwayne- by bullies-and Kevin comes to his aide. 20 years later, Kevin is an ordinary accountant, married to his high school sweetheart, Danielle. His 20 year high school reunion is coming up and he gets a Facebook invite from Dwayne to have a drink and catch up on old times. Dwayne tells Kevin that he has never forgotten his generosity back in high school and that he is the only friend he has ever had. Dwayne then tells Kevin that he needs his accounting skills to help him in his job, as an agent for the C.I.A. Not long after this, Amy shows up, saying that Dwayne used to work for the C.I.A. but went rouge, after killing his own partner and is now trying to sell classified government secrets to terrorists.

Of course, if you really want to know some of them, just let me know and I will spill the beans. Good action, good comedy, good story. What more do you need in a non-sequel movie?

43,meeza,Central Comedic Perks in this one pairing Johnson & Hart,8,6 March 2017,"I did not think that the comedy ""Central Intelligence"" was going to be under the covers of a surprise enjoyable flick, but it sure was. Dwayne Johnson stars as Bob Stone, a former paunchy punching bag target of high school bullies; who years later becomes a musclebound CIA Agent. Kevin Hart co-stars as Calvin Joyner, a former high school athletic phenom who years later is displeased in just being a straight laced accountant, which in reality it calculates to a decent living. Joyner and Bob (in high school, Bob was known as Robbie Weirdicht) were not the best of friends in high school, but Joyner did help that Weirdicht in an embarrassing ""all dicht out"" left-in-the-nude prank on Robbie that was orchestrated by nasty high school bullies. Weirdicht, now a Rolling Bob Stone, never forgot Calvin's graciousness and reaches out to him to help Bob in a CIA case where he is being semi-framed. The plot is not the central intelligent point of ""Central Intelligence""; its rather the clicked chemistry between Johnson and Hart; and most notably Johnson's uproarious comedic performance that simply (what's the word?)... rocked!!!! Director Rawson Marshall Thurber did not manufacture a complex narrative, and that was not his intent. Thurber's direction of the Joyner & Stone interactions is what made him a Thurber King in helming the picture.

I understand, it's important not to overthink a dumb buddy comedy, and Central Intelligence brings a lot of amusing, brainless fun to the table. Sometimes it pushes a bit too far, though, and that's tough to look past. I'm talking about the watery acting (when they aren't ad-libbing, the two leads ham it up like a Christmas dinner), terribly awkward music decisions (shoehorned to fit the late '90s theme) and downright awful effects work (The Rock's face superimposed over a heavy-set teen is especially bad).

The premise itself isn't entertaining, while a number of the jokes simply don't land.However, I still look back on this with somewhat good thoughts. The film surprisingly starts and ends with heart, which I didn't expect. Dwanye Johnson (Robbie) and Kevin Hart (Calvin) work well together, it is one of the weaker performances I've seen from Johnson; even so I appreciate him giving something slightly different from his usual. It's also cool to see Aaron Paul (Phil) and Jason Bateman (Trevor) involved.I believe, all in all, it's the likeable cast and unpredicted (minor) charm that keeps things ticking over to avoid everything dragging. Johnson and Hart have done better, though.",Central Intelligence
50,kirbylee70-599-526179,Between A Rock And A Hart Place,10,22 November 2016,"It's rare that a movie lives up to a great trailer used to promote it. When a movie surpasses the trailer its cause to celebrate. Such is the case with the release of CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE to DVD. The trailer had me laughing out loud when I saw it prior to the film coming out. The movie just added more laughs.The film opens in 1996 at a high school pep rally with a special effected Dwight ""The Rock"" Johnson stars as Robbie, the fat kid in high school everyone picks on. This in itself is hilarious and actually plays into the story. The most popular kid in school is Calvin Joyner (Kevin Hart) who is being celebrated at the rally when the school bullies toss Robbie out to the gym floor sans clothes. Calvin feels for him and gives Robbie his letter jacket to cover up with.Fast forward to the present. Calvin now works as an accountant. The student most likely to succeed isn't doing near as well as he'd hoped. His protégé has surpassed him and gotten a new promotion. Rather than moving up, he's stagnated or even slid down a notch or two. His high school sweetheart/wife on the other hand is a partner at her law firm. Life has not been kind to Calvin.Then the day before the class reunion he gets a friend request on Facebook. He accepts only to find the person now known at Bob Stone is actually Robbie. He agrees to meet with him for drinks and is stunned to discover Robbie has changed into the body building good looking guy in front of him. A confrontation with 4 bad guys in the bar results in Robbie taking them out with ease and impressing Calvin.Robbie asks Calvin for help with a minor problem concerning his payroll account at work. Instead Calvin finds a secret bidding war going on for something that ends in 14 hours. Robbie ropes Calvin into letting him spend the night but the next morning the CIA shows up at Calvin's doorstep searching for Bob. It turns out he's a CIA operative they think killed his partner and stole secret documents now being sold online.Escorted to work Calvin thinks he's safe now only to find Bob there waiting for him after he tricks the CIA agents looking for him off Calvin's floor. Telling him it's a set up and asking for his help, Bob recruits Calvin half against his will and the duo is off and running trying to avoid the CIA and still discover who the traitor is and where the sale will go down. Or is that the case? Could it be that Bob is actually the seller, a killer who is just using Calvin? The movie captures the best elements of the buddy movies from the past with two likable characters who blend together seamlessly on screen. Hart has been funny in nearly everything I've seen him but Johnson has only had a few opportunities to display a talent for comedy. He shines here as Bob, both in and out of CGI mode. While Hart has plenty of humorous moments Johnson equals him in that department. In return Hart gets the opportunity to live out some action moves as well.The movie not only tells the story at hand but delves into the other topics as well, mainly bullying and the effect it has on a person. While Robbie went off and turned himself into Bob the torment he took in high school left its scars on him as displayed when he faces the old school bully. And while he's the one with the heroic good looks and skills it is actually Calvin who displays the truest traits of a hero, the knowledge to do the right thing when Robbie is humiliated at the start of the film and learning to trust the man who considers him a better friend than anyone he's had.Plenty of action keeps the pace of the film running. The plot felt simple for me to figure out before the final reel. The humor kept me laughing from start to finish. When the film ends there are some edited scenes on hand to show these two were having far too much fun filming this movie. All it left me hoping was that the pair would team up for more movies in the future. That seems to be the case as they are currently working on the reworking of JUMANJI together. Let's just hope that Johnson gets the chance to do as much comedy as action films and that Hart is there with him in each and every one.",Central Intelligence
51,AudioFileZ,Saved By Johnson & Hart,6,24 June 2016,"Dewayne Johnson continues to impress as he pretty much carries the film here. It must be said that he wouldn't be nearly as effective without a good co-lead. Kevin Hart hits a sweet spot here against Johnson. It's a good pairing which works hard to make a ridiculous story work.The ugly duckling turn mysterious black swan (i.e.possibly an evil swan) begins a wild ride in which Hart's over-acting seems, well, naturally correct. Hart's Calvin Joyner ""The Golden Jet"" character,is the former high school golden boy who has hit a rut. His life is suddenly turned upside down by the one person who was the most bullied and downtrodden classmate, now known as Johnson's evolved new man, Bob Stone. The strange re-union of the two is exemplified by the fact there's a 20-year class reunion looming among all the chaos. These two might have hit it even better had the story not been as thin and lightweight, but considering all things this is a case where the two leads gel so well as to make the picture much more enjoyable than it has a right to be.",Central Intelligence
52,TheOneThatYouWanted,More of a 6.5 kinda movie. I'm just rounding down.,6,28 June 2016,"I know Kevin Hart is a funny guy. We all know The Rock is awesome. This movie just isn't as good or funny as it should be. Maybe it is the writing, maybe it is the directing; I don't know. All I know is if The Rock or Kevin Hart were not in the movie, it would panned by all the critics and fans. I almost feel bad for The Rock because you see him giving 100% but not even his 100% can help a flat script. The idea behind the movie is great. The idea behind the characters is great. But the execution of the movie just fails. Don't get me wrong, the movie is funny but not as funny as it should be. Kevin Hart and The Rock have to do all the heavy lifting and it is a sad because this could have been one of those classic comedies you would go back and watch over and over again. Oh, and let us talk about that ending. That ending pretty much confirms that the writing/script kills the movie. I just now took the time to use IMDb to see who wrote this and yeah, go check for yourself. It was the writers who turned this into a C- kind of movie. What a shame.",Central Intelligence

It's like people anticipated more after all those movies, which don't really got to be so funny. This movie's earlier premise seems interesting enough that it spots the focus on Dwayne Johnson being a new kind of character than his usual buffed up macho man. But the movie clearly failed to deliver the justified conclusion to its premise. The character development also didn't feel good. The acting is just flat, just all other Kevin Hart comedies.

Aaron Paul also makes a great appearance and uses his signature phrase we all never get tired of hearing, you know what word. The Rock and Hart make a great comic duo in this spy comedy. Also who doesn't love a tale where someone turns their life around like the Rock did.

55,Zbigniew_Krycsiwiki,Pretty good,7,3 August 2016,"6'5"" Dwayne Johnson plays a timid, shy goofball, who has somehow been a CIA agent for years, and contacts an old high school friend (played by Kevin Hart) through facebook, who turns out to be bored with his decent (but not great or exciting) life. Shenanigans ensue, when Hart is unsure if Johnson is who he claims to be, or if he's a killer and hacker.Hart occasionally overdoes his usual screeching act, but he does well as the straight man, and he and Johnson do have a great chemistry together, which alone makes this worth watching. Jason Bateman puts is a really weird, but really funny cameo, as the former high school bully, in a weird twist, vaguely reminiscent of 2015's, The Gift. Funny but unmemorable buddy/ action movie could have benefited from a bit of editing, it's about fifteen minutes too long, and has at least three endings.",Central Intelligence
56,bkrauser-81-311064,Funny Enough,7,1 July 2016,"From the producers of Blue Streak (1999), Wedding Crashers (2005) and Role Models (2008) comes Central Intelligence the newest buddy comedy in a long, long, long, long line of paint-by-numbers buddy comedies. In it Calvin ""The Jet"" Joyner (Hart); formerly the most popular kid in high school, reconnects twenty years later with kinda-sorta friend Bobby Wierdick on the eve of a high school reunion. Growing up, Bobby was morbidly obese, painfully awkward and either bullied or ignored by his classmates. Now Bobby has transformed to Bob Stone; a Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson shaped behemoth who up until the eve of the reunion was a field agent for the CIA. After a night catching up, Calvin is harangued into an espionage plot involving a mysterious terrorist known as the Black Badger.If you were reading the description for the film and automatically thought ""ooo fun"" then you probably won't be disappointed by Central Intelligence. It's a movie you kind of have to meet halfway as far as shutting down your brain and activating your funny-bone. But once you get there you won't be disappointed. The jokes are broad and occasionally go on too long but they are still reliably funny. In fact, between Keanu (2016), Ride Along 2 (2016) and Zoolander 2 (2016), Central Intelligence is hands down the funniest film coming out of the buddy comedy sub-genre this year. I realized when compared to the aforementioned that's not the strongest endorsement. Allow me to explain further.What makes this film a cut-above the banal helpings of gauche odd couple movies and Martin Lawrence vehicles is the themes of its screenplay. Scribes Ike Barinholtz and David Stassen build a opposites annoy scenario out of a very universal desire to become extraordinary.""I really thought I was going to change the world,"" Calvin says grimly to Bob while walking the halls of his alma mater. When we first see Calvin after graduation, he works as an accountant, pushing papers and passive-aggressively hating on his shiftless co-workers. His only solace is his high school sweetheart Maggie (Nicolet) but even then cracks in the veneer incite her to seek counseling. His life is stagnating. All seems lost; then Bob sends him a Facebook friend request.Much like the film's themes, the success of Central Intelligence also relies on our two charming leads. Kevin Hart plays against-type as the straight man to Johnson's farcical antics. You're not really sure if Johnson's pony obsessing, geeking out to 80's movies and all around light stalker-ish behavior is all an elaborate ruse but his gleeful acceptance of the role he's given is downright endearing. He slips seamlessly from gawky fruitcake, to bada** beefcake all the while teaching Calvin a few lessons about appreciating what you have and who you are along the way.If there is a stumble it lies with the CIA plot point which, while providing some decent action set-pieces, never seems exactly necessary. It's given no weight or consequence putting all the cards squarely on whether Calvin should trust Bob. If anything, this tension halves the audiences' attention between the tenuous partnership and the rekindling friendship. We not sure until the end whether Bob has truly gone rogue thus we don't know if Calvin is just an unwilling patsy forced to do financial work for a suspected terrorist. One couldn't help but wonder if the script was tinkered just a bit to give the audience more information vital to the story, the movie could have been just a skosh better.On it's own however, Central Intelligence is a tolerable little time-waster. It provides more chuckles, stronger direction, stronger story than the competition. It gets two entertaining performances out of its charming leads and even features a few casting surprises along the way. Pound for pound, this film is the funniest currently in theaters.",Central Intelligence
57,moviexclusive,"You won't find a more dynamic pair than Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart this summer, and thanks to their chemistry, this odd-couple buddy action comedy genuinely pops",7,16 June 2016,"As convenient as it may be to pigeonhole 'Central Intelligence' into the label of a buddy cop movie, the always-amusing, often-hilarious and surprisingly-affecting action comedy really is much more. For starters, Kevin Hart's Calvin Joyner isn't a cop at all; in fact, he's a put- upon mild-mannered accountant who is disillusioned with his job and where he is at in life, despite being married to his high-school sweetheart (Danielle Nicolet). For another, Calvin and Dwayne Johnson's Bob Stone can't quite be called buddies, especially since they have been out of touch with each other for the past twenty years and are only reconnecting upon Bob's initiation on the eve of their high school homecoming reunion party.Oh yes, the catch here is that while Calvin used to be the high- school superstar who excelled at everything from athletics to academics to drama and was thus dubbed 'The Golden Jet', Bob – who used to go by the name Robbie Weirdicht – was the overweight kid who had to contend with being dragged out of the locker-room shower by a bunch of sneering bullies and thrown naked in the middle of a school assembly. And yet, in his moment of humiliation, Calvin's act of kindness in offering his 'Golden Jet' jacket to cover Bob's privates has made him Bob's hero, so much so that Bob worships Calvin as no less than his idol. But it isn't just for old times' sake that Bob is now reaching out to Calvin – indeed, after watching 'Fat Robbie'- turned-He-Man take out four bullies in front of his eyes, Calvin agrees to Bob's seemingly innocuous favour of accounting help with his overseas payroll.And so begins a series of CIA hijinks, as Bob reveals himself to be a CIA agent after someone known as the 'Black Badger' who has stolen the US satellite encryption keys and intends to sell them to the highest bidder. Though Calvin wants no part in the high-stakes operation, he finds that he is already unwittingly involved when Bob's superior Pamela (Amy Ryan) turns up at his doorstep and informs him that Bob is a rogue agent who happens to be the very Badger himself. Oh, there's also the question of whether Bob's former partner (Aaron Paul in an extended cameo) was killed by the Badger as Bob claims or was in fact killed by Bob himself as Pamela claims. As earnest as Bob may appear, Calvin's struggle as he grazes past one life-threatening setpiece after another is whether to trust Bob in the first place.From an extended shootout at Calvin's office that ends with Bob and Calvin crashing through the eleventh-storey window onto a giant gorilla inflatable below, to a CIA safe house where Calvin springs Bob from custody, to an underground parking garage where Bob comes face to face with his nemesis, director Rawson Marshall Thurber stages the action with surprising élan, emphasizing Johnson's swift and lethal moves as well as Hart's barely controlled hysteria at every turn. Yet because Johnson and Hart have performed similar shtick in previous roles, the real fun is in watching the two actors play against each other in quieter and more intimate scenes, such as a couples' therapy session between Calvin and his wife which Bob crashes by pretending to be their therapist.It is in scenes such as this that the sheer chemistry between Johnson and Hart shines through. Thurber, who co-wrote the script with Ike Barinholtz and David Stassen, plays against his audience's expectation by letting the usually motor-mouthed Hart play the straight man and Johnson be the unhinged man-child responsible for the verbal and physical shenanigans. Thanks to Johnson and Hart's elevated performances, the 'role reversal' works beautifully and makes for reason alone to watch this instead of say the next 'Ride Along' sequel. The stronger than usual character work is yet further proof that this film is a notch above many others of its ilk, demonstrated in the insecurities that Bob and Calvin each have to deal with individually along the way.Even though the opening scene of Bob's teenage appearance in the form of Johnson's face fattened by CG trickery suggests that it may end up pandering to the lowest-denominator, 'Central Intelligence' ultimately proves unexpectedly sensitive to the plight of those bullied in high school in its concluding scene, where Bob finally overcomes his personal demons to take the stage in front of his schoolmates twenty years after being painfully humiliated. Besides a cameo by Melissa McCarthy as Bob's high-school crush, it is as sweet a parting shot as any, underscoring yet again what an earnestly endearing and humorous joyride this odd-couple buddy movie has been. Most of all, Johnson and Hart are like 'yin' and 'yang', and together they prove that a little Hart and a big Johnson goes a long, long way.",Central Intelligence
58,quincytheodore,"The polarizing duo might not have the best chemistry, but each has their own quirky way to entertain",7,15 June 2016,"It's quite possible that they cast Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson just to make ""Little Hart, Big Johnson"" pun. As far as buddy cop goes, this contrasting nature can provide some chuckles, however the espionage them might not hit all the marks. Still, there are significant amount of scenes where laughter is secured by sheer timely body language and jokes alone.Dwayne Johnson plays as Bob, a CIA agent who tries to reach out to his old friend. This escalates into a chase for secret files and national security. The way Bob is presented relies heavily on juvenile gag and demeanor despite his imposing physique, this is fun at first but it hampers the credibility as an agent. The movie wants to add some bullying subplot which is commendable, although it doesn't have the depth to accommodate it.Kevin Hart is excellent in creating reactions and gestures. He's surprisingly identifiable with high school nostalgia and occasional self-doubt. Many of the good moments come from his outbursts and babbling. The script has a few nifty pop references and sometimes even witty gags, so the comedy is not just slapstick throughout and undermines the ""intelligence"" in the title.There are serious undertones of adult life or self-acceptance even though they are not fully fleshed out. Action is pretty light, it's passable without being too demanding. The most important thing is it's enjoyable. Sure, there are a few awkward moments, yet they make the best out of it to present a light humorous spectacle, a better buddy cop gimmick than expected.",Central Intelligence

61,Screen_Blitz,Funny buddy comedy with a surprising amount of heart and wit,8,20 December 2016,"Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Kevin Hart are both fairly likable actors, so it is understandable to root for these two to collaborate. Fortunately, these pair up to deliver both laughs and fun this guy-busting action comedy where audiences witness as these two develop a sweet chemistry. In slick efforts by director Rawson Marshall Thurbur, the outcome results in a hilarious action-oriented comedic fare that though not devoid of typical buddy comedy clichés, boasts a crudely funny good time. Furthermore, it exhibits Dwayne Johnson breaking his bulky action hero typecasting in favor of expanding upon his acting range, and that involves taking a stab at the action comedy genre. As for Kevin Hart on the other hand, this is definitely nothing new but it does show a nice step forward from his more lukewarm comedies, with 'Ride Along' being one of his worst of his filmography. So this film opens up in 1996, when geeky, overweight high schooler Robbie Weirdicht (played by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) was a designated punching back for bullies at school as opposed to Calvin Joyner (played by Kevin Hart) who was a popular kid. Twenty years later, Calvin Joyner is a service accountant married to his sweetheart Maggie (played by Danielle Nicolet). When the now-muscular Robbie Weirdicht unexpectedly returns and sends him a friend request on Facebook, the two go out for a drink at a local bar. Next morning, Calvin and Robbie find themselves hunted down by the CIA lead by agent Pamela Harris (played by Amy Ryan), with Calvin learning that Robbie is either a CIA agent framed for murder, or a vicious assassin wanted for murder. From there on, Calvin must survive through a series of violent shootouts while struggling to decide who to trust: his old friend or the CIA.If this laugh-out-loud comedy has any weaknesses along with a small array of hit-and-miss jokes, it is that the final outcome of the plot is predictable, if not formulaic. On the bright side, it shows both Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart operating with appropriate comedic performances with a surprising amount of heart. Arguably the most appealing gem this film has to offer is the sweet chemistry between Johnson and Hart which serves as the primary driving force of the plot. The hilarious, loud banter between the two stars is quite funny to listen to, and thanks to the soulfully effective, it never comes off forced or awkward. When guns began firing and bullets are flying and tearing through bodies, that is when most of the fun is unleashed but not limited to. When the action hits the pause button, we witness Johnson and Hart engage in hilarious conversations involving clever pop culture references and silly sex jokes that occasionally come off less funny than they set out to be. When the two are not cracking jokes, there is also some heartfelt messages about friendship which fits the story quite well mainly when explaining how the Kevin Hart character was always super popular while the Dwayne Johnson character was always a target for bullies and never had friends. Amy Ryan who plays the leader of the CIA agents hunting the duo down has her fair share of screen time but doesn't quite succeed in coming up any good laughs beyond a few slick one-liners here and there. Danielle Nicolet also receives a good amount of screen time but sadly isn't given a whole lot to do in the way in which her character is written. In the end, the film functions as a slick, solidly paced action-filled comedy that never feels dull nor boring in anyway.Central Intelligence is a hilarious buddy comedy with a fair amount of heart and wit to support it's exhilarating barrage of belly laughs. It is a surprising film that shows it's two leads collaborating with fine results that are more than likely to please die-hard comedy fans. For those looking for a fun buddy comedy, Central Intelligence safely makes that score.",Central Intelligence

He's got a decision to make, does he go to his high school reunion, or more to the point, how do he get out of going? He receives a random friend request from what appears to be Bob.

Before he knows it though Calvin is under suspcion of harbouring a dangerous criminal, a spy gone rogue, Bob! Who is Bob? Can Calvin trust Bob? Can Calvin escape Bob? Should Calvin escape Bob?This was actually a fun film, a bit predictable in places but still ok. I guess you'd class this as a buddy action movie with hints of comedy. It has some moral lessons hidden within the film and lots of feel good too. Hart and The Rock have a good chemistry, this isn't their first film together and it seems they are both able to bounce off each other.

I understand, it's important not to overthink a dumb buddy comedy, and Central Intelligence brings a lot of amusing, brainless fun to the table. Sometimes it pushes a bit too far, though, and that's tough to look past. I'm talking about the watery acting (when they aren't ad-libbing, the two leads ham it up like a Christmas dinner), terribly awkward music decisions (shoehorned to fit the late '90s theme) and downright awful effects work (The Rock's face superimposed over a heavy-set teen is especially bad).

He pulls a reluctant Joyner into an adventure - and hilarity ensues...or, at least, some pretty good laughs.I enjoyed this film. Director Rawson Marshall Thurber (WE'RE THE MILLERS, DODGEBALL) moves the action/comedy along at a fast, but not furious, pace so you can enjoy each scene, but not really worry about the lack of character development or plot holes. Just enjoy it.Is it a topnotch film? No. The plot holes are big and besides Hart's and Johnson's characters, there are no other interesting characters and certainly no other characters are fleshed out. They serve the plot and the comedy and that's it. As for the two main characters, as stated above, Hart plays Hart. Either you like it or you don't. I think this movie swings with what they do with Dwayne Johnson's character. He holds a traumatic bullying experience with him throughout this film and they try to play off of that, I don't think they totally succeed with this, but I applaud the effort.Is this movie going to winner Oscars? No. Is it a fun and entertaining summer film, one that will make you laugh and enjoy yourself for 2 hours? Definitely.7 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)",Central Intelligence
73,dave-mcclain,"""Central Intelligence"" has a strong central premise, but just isn't very... intelligent.",4,18 June 2016,"Just when you thought it was safe to go back in the theater. That intro is a paraphrase of the famous tag line from a 1978 summer movie sequel (""Jaws 2""), which helps explain how I feel about the action comedy ""Central Intelligence"" (PG-13, 1:54). While this movie is not part of a summer film franchise (yet), I think the comparison is apt. Similar to the way the absence of sharks in the waters of Amity Island tragically lulled its people into a false sense of security, you might think that Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart would have learned the dangers of complacency in their acting. Feminizing a legendary tough guy (like casting Hulk Hogan in 1993's ""Mr. Nanny"", or Johnson himself in 2010's ""The Tooth Fairy"") does not automatically equal funny. The same applies to allowing/forcing Kevin Hart to take on another hyperactive motor-mouthed role like in the ""Ride Along"" movies. Hart is better when his comedy is more restrained (for example, in ""The Wedding Ringer"" or even ""Get Hard""). For his part, Johnson is funny when he plays off of his tough-guy image (as he did in 2010's ""The Other Guys""), rather than almost completely against it, as he does in this film. While ""Central Intelligence"" is not a bad movie, it's not as strong as you might think when you see Hart's mug on the movie poster – and Johnson's muscles.The movie's title has a dual meaning. Before we even learn that one of the main characters works for the Central Intelligence Agency, we see them when they were students – at Central High School – where they are getting an education and gaining intelligence. These two characters, Robbie Whierdicht (Johnson) and Calvin Joyner (Hart), had little in common as classmates. Calvin is everyone's favorite person (as the principal points out in a school assembly). He's dating Maggie (Danielle Nicolet), the most beautiful girl in school and he is known by the nickname ""The Golden Jet"". He's a star athlete, a drama club stand-out and has been voted ""Most Likely to Succeed"" by his fellow seniors. Robbie, on the other hand, is a nerdy fat kid who sings and dances in the shower to R&B/Pop songs and is picked on by bullies who mercilessly and publicly humiliate him. The only one who shows Robbie any compassion is Calvin.20 years later, the fortunes of both Robbie and Calvin have changed dramatically. In fact, they've completely reversed (similar to the two main characters in 2012's ""21 Jump Street""). Calvin got the girl, but his marriage to Maggie has gotten a little rocky. Calvin works as an accountant. He's good at his job, but he hates it and has to endure the indignity of seeing his former assistant get promoted over him. Calvin feels that he peaked in high school and tells Maggie that he's not going to their 20-year high school reunion because he's dreading the ""what are you doing now"" question. It's quite a different story when we (and he) see Robbie again. Robbie has turned his excess weight into muscle mass and he's an agent in the CIA, even though he's still in touch with his sensitive side – wearing a sky blue unicorn T-shirt and extolling the virtues of the 1984 classic ""Sixteen Candles"". These two very different men are about to become reacquainted and become true friends for the first time – if they don't get killed first.Robbie isn't Robbie anymore – not just physically, but legally. His name is now Bob Stone and he gives Calvin a call after Calvin accepts his Facebook friend request, even though Calvin didn't understand at first who Bob Stone really was. That phone call turns into hanging out in a bar (and a bar fight because, as Bob says, ""I don't like bullies"") and Bob ends up crashing at Calvin's house that night. Bob tricks Calvin into getting him some information for a case that he's working and, by the time Bob reveals his job and his motives, Calvin is hip deep in international intrigue. Even though Bob has a particular set of skills of his own, he needs Calvin's particular skill set (and his decency and trustworthiness) to stop a grave threat to U.S. national security. Complicating matters is a group of CIA operatives, led by Agent Pamela Harris (Amy Ryan) who is trying to arrest Bob, saying that he's a central player in the plot that Bob says he is trying to stop. It's Abbott and Costello in a global whodunit.""Central Intelligence"" has entertaining moments, but they're diminished by implausible and clichéd plot points and ridiculous characters. Some of the specifics of Hart's character don't make a lot of sense, a criticism which is even more pronounced in the case of Johnson's character. And it doesn't help that both actors are playing to their weaknesses and first-time feature director Rawson Marshall Thurber seems unwilling or unable to focus the acting in a more realistic and entertaining direction. The script, by Thurber, actor-comedian Ike Barinholtz and David Sassen, relies too much on action-comedy-mystery tropes and makes their characters do things that feel random, unmotivated and silly. The light-hearted tone and some cool cameos help a little, but most of the movie is just a little on this side of dumb. The film's central idea is a strong one, but it would've been better if it were more intelligent. ""C+""",Central Intelligence
74,swilliky,Starpower and chemistry lead to a successful comedy,6,28 June 2016,"The combination of wrestler Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and comedian Kevin Hart proves a winning formula in this laugh out loud summer release. Hart plays accountant Calvin Joyner who was once popular back in high school lending his varsity jacket to a bullied CGI overweight Johnson as Robby Weirdicht aka Bob Stone. This event has repercussions twenty years later as Hart's Joyner has become disaffected in his professional life and having trouble in his marriage. Bob Stone shows up right before the twenty-year high school reunion and he has packed on the muscles from working out six hours everyday for twenty years.Stone also has become a CIA agent and involves who he believes is his best friend, the accountant Joyner. Hart is great as the reluctant accomplice caught up in a case of international espionage that doesn't have much of a background focusing more on jokes. There are a few spots where the action pauses to let Hart deliver long comedic monologues that don't always hit as great as his standup does and slows down the plot but the comedy is greatly enhanced by The Rock's giddy performance. As a once peculiar kid, Johnson embodies the bullied kid Weirdicht who has now become a tough international spy.Check out more of this review and others at swilliky.com",Central Intelligence
75,bob-the-movie-man,Great Poster. So-so film.,5,22 December 2016,"""Saving the World Takes a Little Hart and a Big Johnson"". I doubt I have ever passed a film poster before and dissolved into paroxysms of mirth, so this film at least wins one award with me. The story is pretty inconsequential, and used as a framework to build set pieces around. Kevin Hart (""Ride Along"") plays Calvin Joyner – the life and soul of his high school and the guy voted 'Most likely to succeed'. He's also a nice guy, sensitively covering the modesty of overweight loser Robbie Wheirdicht (a good Dwayne Johnson lookalike actually played by internet wedding-dance sensation Sione Kelepi) after he's been ridiculed by bullies in front of the whole school.But sometimes life doesn't go to plan and twenty year's later Calvin may have married his high school sweetheart Maggie (Danielle Nicolet) but has ended up in a low-level forensic accountancy job and not where he wants to be. Robbie on the other hand has transformed his life and physique to become Bob Stone (Dwayne Johnson), a man with a 'certain set of skills' and, as it turns out, a rogue CIA operative. Bob is on the trail of financial codes to help identify the location of the traitorous 'Black Badger' who killed his long-term partner Stanton (Aaron Paul). But the Black Badger could be anyone, and the CIA lead (Amy Ryan) suspects it might actually be Stone. With the stakes rising the inept Joyner needs to make a decision on who to trust and who to fear.The comedy lead Kevin Hart previously impressed with ""Get Hard"" and raises a few laughs in this one, notably with his attempt at his signature flip twenty years later than he should have attempted it! Johnson's character is written to be just plain weird and with Johnson's limited acting range (think Arnie in ""Jingle All The Way"") it's a performance that is on the outlandish side of bizarre. Together the duo make for a likable pair but this is a very lightweight comedy and is generally a smile-along rather than a laugh-along. It is also uneven in tone, occasionally straying into highly un-comedic territory: a throat- ripping out scene anyone? The director is Rawson Marshall Thurber who previously directed the better comedy ""Dodgeball"" and the far worse ""We're the Millers"". So that should set your expectations.A fairly ho-hum comedy which might entertain you on a long plane flight but is not worth forking out much cash to rent.(Please visit http://bob-the-movie-man.com for the graphical version of this review.

76,bryank-04844,'Central Intelligence' is the movie the world needs right now.,7,23 January 2017,"What would a Summer-Movie-Season be without Kevin Hart and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson? This summer, the two team up in an action-comedy called 'Central Intelligence', directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber ('Dodgeball' and 'We're The Millers') and co-written by actor/writer Ike Barinholtz ('Neighbors'). With so many buddy-cop action comedies out there, it's sometimes difficult to tell one of them from another. Sure, there are the greats like 'Lethal Weapon', 'Turner and Hooch', and 'Tango and Cash', but what does modern day buddy-cop action comedies hold that the past films don't? When relating this to 'Central Intelligence', it seems like the filmmakers thought it would be a lot of fun to put these two personalities together and basically let them riff off each other for a couple of hours. Throw in a some guns and a half baked plot about world security and terror, along with a message about being bullied, and you have yourself 'Central Intelligence'.This film doesn't really pay attention to much with the actual plot at hand here, but more or less has Hart and 'The Rock' running around in comical scenes with some action to move the so-called story along. I know that doesn't sound great, but the chemistry and comedy between these two is quite funny and charming all at the same time. It's this only aspect that makes the film watchable and thoroughly enjoyable. You've seen better action scenes before in other films and you've laughed harder elsewhere too, but when these two actors come together, they make for a hilarious duo. I wouldn't be surprised if there is a sequel to this at some point.The film starts out back in the mid-90s where Calvin Joyner (Hart) and Bob Stone (The Rock) are in high school. Calvin is the star of the school and is involved in everything from sports to theatre and is most likely to succeed. Bob Stone is a fat kid with braces who loves John Hughes and sings in the public high school shower. After a major embarrassing incident in the middle of the whole school, Bob is truly defeated and Calvin is the only one who helps. Cut to present day where Calvin is unhappy with his mediocre accounting job and Bob Stone is now 'The Rock'.Sooner than later, bad guys and even the CIA are gunning for Bob Stone and Calvin now, and you never know if Bob Stone is an enemy of the state or the good guy, but none of this really matters here, as an excellent field of cameos pop up and the jokes between The Rock and Hart are almost endless, with the exception of when Calvin is trying to decide if his old friend is trustworthy. Again, 'Central Intelligence' isn't the ultimate buddy-cop action comedy, but it certainly has its moments. There are a ton of movie references, some solid comedy, and 'The Rock' wearing a unicorn T-Shirt. You just can't get enough of that silly fun. Stay tuned during the credits for outtakes.RECOMMENDED!",Central Intelligence
77,Carycomic,"I thought I'd be bored out of my skull. But, I was wrong!",9,18 June 2016,"OK! To start off with, I will make an announcement that will probably have some of you muttering ""WTF.""This is the first time I've ever heard of Kevin Hart.It's true! When I first saw the lobby card for this movie, I thought it was going to be starring _two_ Rocks! Dwayne Johnson...and screechy- voiced Chris (who, as far as I'm permanently concerned, has gone downhill since the ""Rush Hour"" trilogy). Fortunately, for me, however, I soon realized that the actor playing Calvin ""C.J."" Joyner had a comparatively lower voice, and a much better acting range, than Chris. Including the ability to do his jokes (intentional and otherwise) in a much subtler--and ,thus, way funnier--manner than Chris!Something you'll see for yourselves during the end-credit blooper reel. You should also keep your eyes peeled for an uncredited cameo by Melissa McCarthy (who, as I understand it, recently did a spy spoof of her own opposite Jason Statham).Add to that the under-rated comedic talent of Mr. Johnson, himself (talent that his roles in RUN DOWN and JOURNEY 2 THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND proved, to me at least, that he had), and you have a nice little action-packed time killer for a boring Saturday afternoon.The only reason I deduct one star from my score? I really think Warner Brothers and Universal should have delayed the release until much later this summer. Just in case some movie-goers might think the otherwise mandatory gunfight scenes were a little bit in poor taste, given the recent tragedies in Orlando.",Central Intelligence
78,msbreviews,Rating: C+,6,6 August 2017,"This is not a bad movie whatsoever, it's actually a pretty decent comedy with the main pro being the cast. Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart have an amazing chemistry that can, not only be proved throughout the movie, but also at the end credits with the blooper reel. It really seems like a genuine friendship and that was the best part of the film: every time they were together I had a blast!I like Hart as a stand-up comedian and as an actor as well, even when he has those Kevin Hart's moments (high-pitched voice, screams, excessive gestures). Both him and Dwayne Johnson were good, but I struggled a bit with the last one: I didn't know if he was being annoying or actually kind of cool ... I guess it was a little bit of both, it worked for me, so nothing to complain here.The writing is OK, there aren't exactly moments to make you laugh until you cry, but it sure gave me some good laughs. The directing was also surprisingly good! The up-close action sequences weren't that nice, a lot of shaky-cam and abundance of cuts, but the chasing and shooting scenes were really great and cool to look at.The movie crumbles when it tries to introduce a more serious tone to the plot, which is already not that good. It's predictable, full of clichés and it didn't really captivate me. At one point the movie stopped caring about the plot and it was just trying to make something up so that Hart and Johnson could be together again.A huge mess is created while trying to explain the villain's story, Black Badger. First, everyone appears to be the Black Badger, since everyone exclaims ""No, I am the Black Badger"" successively in a scene (like, 2min of this constant re-iteration). Then, through flashbacks, the film tries to explain who it really is so many times when it didn't need any explanation and it made the last act of the film a lot more confusing.The ending has a very important message about bullying, but it could have been handled in a much better way instead of the cliché-type that kind of took the whole spirit out of it.Still, Central Intelligence has its good moments with the perfect chemistry between the two protagonists and, if they are able to remove the serious side of the plot without ruining it completely, I can totally see a sequel in a near future.MSB Reviews - If you like my reviews, please follow my blog :)",Central Intelligence

83,Magow-Intermean,Central Intelligence Review,8,8 April 2019,"Fortyish accountant Calvin Joyner (Kevin Hart) was once the coolest guy in school, but now he's depressed with his middle management lot. That changes when the former geeky kid at school, now a CIA assassin (Dwayne Johnson), enlists his help.
Everybody loves The Rock, right? His skill at both one-liners and punching people through walls means an action comedy with his name above the title definitely pops the interest. Sadly, in Kevin Hart he's saddled with a co-star who, rather than bringing the belly laughs, is nigh-on unbearable, and a script that barely feels like it reached a second draft. As is sadly familiar, The Rock is the best thing in a deeply ropey enterprise.Hart's performance seems to be gunning for Joe Pesci in Lethal Weapon 3 in the irritation stakes.
It's a shame, because there's an inkling of a decent idea here. Twenty years ago Johnson's school fatty was humiliated in front of his entire year - his digital transformation into an obese teenager is quite something - and now he's turned his life around, lost the weight, and works for the CIA. The cool kid who comforted him - Hart - is depressingly aware he peaked in high school, and now hates his childless, professionally unfulfilled existence. The Rock bursts back into Hart's life out of the blue thanks to some vague spy nonsense, and in the film's sole interesting touch of reality the cool kid/fat kid dynamic from school is recreated in adulthood - despite Kevin Hart being the size of a table leg and The Rock being, well, The Rock. Central Intelligence's best moments come when this is stressed, with the nerdy, bum-bag loving chump persisting inside the man-mountain.That set-up suggests that character comedy was initially the goal here, but it's not what's resulted. We're sure not in the realm of intrigue: the central McGuffin - something to do with Hart, an accountant, being able to track transactions pertaining to stolen spy satellite data - is barely sketched, and the terrorist threat it carries with it makes no sense, unless Isis are headed to America via Zeppelin.Instead, we're faced with an action comedy where the action is so perfunctory it makes Cop Out seem like Heat. Director Rawson Marshall Thurber (Dodgeball, We're The Millers) has no form in this department, and it shows - this material needs an Edgar Wright, not a point-and-shoot journeyman.The comedy isn't up to much, either: scenes plod on and on with the slack editing of an Apatow improv-fest, only without the jokes. Hart seems aware of this, and tries to compensate by screeching his way through a performance that seems to be gunning for Joe Pesci in Lethal Weapon 3 in the irritation stakes. Dad jokes about Twilight and social media suggest the script sat on a shelf for a while: you can practically see the dust falling off the screen. Jason Bateman and Kumail Nanjiani do show up for welcome cameos, with Bateman producing a comic riff on his nasty turn in The Gift, and when they do you can feel the whole thing come to life - but it's only twitching on the table.An action comedy without any action or comedy - not even The Rock's charisma and enthusiasm can save this dud.",Central Intelligence
84,James_De_Bello,5.5/10,5,18 July 2016,"After the success of ""We're the Millers"", a comedy that got mixed reactions from critics, yet that I personally really enjoyed, Rawson Marshall Thurber is back with another comedy. In ""Central Intelligence"" Calvin Joyner (Kevin Hart) meets through Facebook an old high school companion Bob Stone (Dwayne Johnson). After what appears to be an innocent night of drinks between buddies, Calvin is lured into an espionage plot by Stone who doesn't accept 'no' as an answer for Calvin's involvement.Despite not being particularly excited for this comedy, I was curious enough to check out what The Rock and Hart could have in store for a good buddy action comedy and the results are kind of underwhelming, even though nobody comes out of this looking bad.The film opened with a very offbeat flashback scene that could not find its voice and ended up being mean spirited. It turns you off immediately because other than being uncomfortable it also is not funny. Fortunately, as soon as Kevin Hart appears on screen as his present-day self a lot of that goes away because had it kept going in that direction it could have become one of the most annoying and ridiculous films of recent years.I cannot say I laughed a lot in this film, the laugh out loud count was most probably under six, yet in its defense I can confidently say that throughout the whole duration I did have a smile on face. That is indicative of the measure of the film. It is not by any means a great comedy, there isn't a smart use of cinematic technique to deliver laughs, it is shot way too generically to give it any kind of interesting or upbeat stamp to it. Not to mention how utterly overbearing is this predictable plot which isn't half as smart as the writers think it is and doesn't become a parody on itself or the genre, it does not give the film a funny self consciousness, it falls just flat unfortunately and fails to matter in the bigger picture.What the movie does have is two great, charismatic, funny leads, with good chemistry that play off each other perfectly when there isn't generic writing or directing getting in their way. Many times you don't get to enjoy Hart of Johnson because of standard witty banter or observational comedy that we have seen too many times in American comedies and is a trend that has to end because it clearly isn't funny. Yet, when the two leads manage to play a scene fully or riff off each other it is a joy to see and Hart does a good job of playing the straight man and letting Johnson unfold on screen, which gives us some great moments and some very good running gags that were some of the most funny parts of the film. Moreover an element that is nailed in the film is giving each secondary and even tertiary characters a specific vibe which results in some great laughs and henchmen not being anonymous people appearing on screen and instead contributing to the picture.Whilst the ending of the film was a disaster that made my score and overall enjoyment of the film decline, I still had a decent time with Central Intelligence, it isn't a fresh comedy by any means but it had some inspired moments",Central Intelligence
85,scottshak_111,What a pleasant surprise!,7,21 July 2016,"Going into the theater, I didn't expect much from this Rocky-Hart venture that seemed oddly named as Central Intelligence. Whilst from the surface it appeared the same as any comedy movie Kevin Hart had in the past pounced upon, finding it good simply made my day.DIRECTION OF CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE This is what I expect from a good comedy flick – a good slow paced direction to keep you thoroughly engaged whilst throwing in some laughable bits every now and then. At the same time not compromising the crucial plot at play. Rawson Marshall Thurber ensures the audience has plenty. There were well thought of comic bits strewn all across the movie, as he tries to work upon a rare build up to get to his punch lines. He will make you used to it, and you will be waiting with jaws wide open expecting a funny liner bomb to be dropped anytime.THE ROCK AND HART CONNECTION Central Intelligence is a buddy flick. Even though the protagonists are oddly paired, minutes into the movie and you will notice neither of them is a douche. They are totally nice guys and they gradually create a stunning chemistry that most Nice Guys movies profusely miss. Kevin Hart's Calvin Joyner is like a confused blend of perseverance and slapstick comedy. At dire moments when his emotional rivers go inundated, he reacts just as anybody of us would react, and that makes it both funny and relatable. That's what Thurber pays attention to, letting Hart go savage at situational savagery.SPOILER RIOT AHEAD: CAMEOS There are endearing cameos that make you go, ""Hey! Jason Bateman's in the movie."" Or ""Melissa McCarthy's in it too."" Whilst Jason gets a shot once again at the Bully storyline, (seriously I can't see how he fits the bill there!), Melissa's role is ephemeral. Aaron Paul has a good role for a cameo as Phil and he will make your heart melt when he goes ""Bitch!"" bringing in memories from Breaking Bad. Kumail Nanjiani beams you up with his perfect comic timing in a funny Airport distraction scene. Ryan Hansen as Steve was hilarious too.There is plenty of dope action inscribed in Central Intelligence for a comedy movie which looks absolutely spectacular when it gets delivered by Dwayne Johnson. Hart makes it all better with his rib-tickling descriptions.DOWNSIDES On the big downside of the movie is Dwayne Johnson's pathetic good guy acting. When I see him it feels like he is acting. Give me something that betrays it Rocky! That and the fact that the plot would make you go meh! We have seen too much of that sorts. Another one is that it goes too slow at times and doesn't retain something that will throw you into fits of laughter to be candid.THE FINAL VERDICT Overall Central Intelligence was very entertaining, had funny situations that squeezed out comedy.

86,coreyjdenford,Central stupidity,4,29 June 2016,"This is my review of Central Intelligence (spoiler free) ** (2/5)Cast: Kevin Hart, Dwayne Johnson, Amy Ryan, Danielle Nicolet.Plot: After he reunites with an old school pal through Facebook, a mild-mannered accountant is lured into the world of international espionage.Everyone knows who Dwayne Johnson is at this point we can all bet that once he punches someone in his movies that person is then going to get thrown into a wall and it's going to be funny, however this is neither action nor comedy because the action isn't fun and the comedy is just dry. With poor writing that sounds like it didn't even reach the second draft so it sounds stupid basically. Kevin Hart used to be the funniest man in America when he did his stand up acts however ever since he started doing movies, like Ride Along 1-2, Get Hard the movies have been lacking one thing comedy. This also makes references to much better movies like Roadhouse and 16 Candles so as you can see not an enjoyable comedy. Calvin (Hart) is an accountant for a major company however his life feels empty so what should happen? Well he gets a friend request from Bob (Johnson) with an interesting voice change however that voice change still isn't funny. So he then takes Calvin on an adventure where his life is constantly at risk. Conveniently Kevin Hart is more annoying and more irritating than he is in Ride Along (2014) which wasn't too bad, it's not great but it's not bad either. Just like those two other ""comedies"" there is no story and no character development and that is something that a movie like this needs. However even though the chemistry is amazing between Johnson and Hart the film is lax on actually making that better. However the script by Ike Barinholtz barely even holds out for its length bad thing. There is also a cameo from Melissa McCarthy and so you can see this movie is trying its hardest to be funny when it just isn't it is a dry comedy and quite frankly stupid. The other main thing that should be mentioned there is no control in vocal tones but I guess this movie was just rushed, interestingly even the bloopers during the end credits weren't even funny either, the most interesting thin that can be recalled is that the soundtrack is actually OK, its not the best but its okay so the soundtrack by Ludwig Goransson and Theodore Shapiro isn't that bad although it sounds similar to a Christopher Lennertz soundtrack.Here are some points as to why this is a comedy that should be avoided:No Story: The lack of story makes this movie duller than it already was however the ""story"" whatever there is, is stupid and quite frankly just wrong it makes it sound like this is a movie that shouldn't have been done. The story is quick to get to Johnson and Hart making friends however even that is dull, this is just and uncharacteristic and an idiotic mess and it just falls apart after the first ten minutes in fact not even that and it is just wrong the story is wrong and stupid, so next time they want to do a comedy like this make sure it has a better script or just doesn't have Kevin Hart.No Character development: Another that is lacking is the intelligence for one thing it's the character development all you learn is what their names are and also what they do but that is it there is no development whatsoever. It sounds like if this movie just Dwayne Johnson in it, it would have more interesting. No character development even though these characters connect instantaneously and that makes this movie better but not much.However there is an interesting back story/flashback when Bob remembers his time at High School conveniently he was very fat and when the bullies saw him again they were expecting him to turn out the way he did. That is the interesting thing in this movie apart from appearances by Jason Bateman and Aaron Paul they stick the story together but however Bateman is more dry than he usually is. In-case you are wondering he plays Trevor who is one of the people who bullied Bob in school. All in all this movie is stupid and quite frankly should never have been done.Verdict: Stupid, and lacking the main thing comedy, another ""comedy"" with Kevin but lacks his Hart. Even the Rock's enthusiasm and charisma cannot save this dud.",Central Intelligence

Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and Kevin Hart star in this absolutely farcical movie about a bullied fat kid turned muscle man who also happens to be in the CIA. The script gave us scenarios reminiscent of Eddie Murphy in the Beverly Hills Cop movies where he uses about a million words when one short sentence can suffice. The story was outlandish, and everyone was overacting so much it all combined to give us one of those amusing films that actually make us laugh out loud from time to time. Even though once again we got shown most of the funniest bits in the trailers they still made me laugh when they were put into context in the film. I just knew the mismatched partnership would work, The Rock is about 15 feet tall and Kevin Hart is about quarter of that yet they awkwardly rub along throughout the whole film. Total trash........loved it!!!",Central Intelligence
88,Mcduff3601,A mediocre comedy that proved entertaining,6,29 May 2018,"There wasn't much to this one and I am usually not a fan of Kevin Hart's screaming routine all the time. But in this movie it worked as he played a scared working stiff thrown into some crazy scenario.The jokes are mild but still kind of funny, like a ""hmm that is humerous"" vs. ""stop I can't stop laughing Imma pee my pants"".I am starting to become a fan of The Rock though. Last movie I saw him in was Baywatch and it was surprisingly funny. Also a mediocre comedy. If you go with this movie you could be making the biggest mistake of your life. Or the biggest good decision of your life. You ever play russion roulette? Time to spin the chamber Boris.",Central Intelligence
89,the amorphousmachine,Slightly above average buddy comedy flick!,6,17 February 2021,"(minor spoiler)Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart star in this buddy comedy that involves high school reunions, the CIA, wrongful accusations, bullying and being your own hero, or something like that. 'Central Intelligence' is full of clichés and predictable plot outcomes, but it's pretty much what I was expecting. A watchable comedy where Dwayne Johnson shows his comedic chops, and Kevin Hart does Kevin Hart yet again. It is okay, but I do tire of comedies referencing a movie or a pop group, and that movie or pop group appears, or is recreated at the end! 'Sixteen Candles' seemed to be the film of choice here. As far as a predictable plot, you can pretty much guess who the villain in Black Badger is when they show a prominent actor seemingly getting a bit part. It's all been rehashed and rethreaded in many films, and the buddy comedy has been done better in past films!*** out of *****!",Central Intelligence
90,srdjan_veljkovic,A minimally watchable product,5,3 July 2016,"It is not really funny, basically there is no one good laugh in the whole movie. But, there are many somewhat funny situations/lines, like when Rock and his little partner jump out the window onto a big balloon-monkey.It is not really fun, but, it is engaging enough to not be boring or just plain bad. The Rock kicks some but, but in a mostly-believable way and not too much.The story is not really good, but, it doesn't have serious flaws, for a comedy, that is. It is mostly consistent, has a good progress and doesn't just implode near the end, like a lot of modern movies (comedies included).Acting is not really good, it's mostly over-acting, but, both the Rock and his little partner don't ""over do over-acting"", so to speak. Again, it's a comedy, over-acting is somewhat expected.So there are a lot of better movies, but, this one satisfies the minimum quality bar. It's a good way to take a rest if you're not sleepy.",Central Intelligence

I did watch both ""Ride Along"" and I really like the first one but not the second one because I think its so cliché and not really funny. Then, I still watch this movie because I just want to enjoy some lighthearted fun movie and... its really a good choice!Its really funny, exciting and hilarious to watch.

92,FelipeCarrillo,Another Comedy Does Not Fulfill What Promises,6,5 August 2016,"Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart join forces in a predictable comedy and not as extraordinary as its grosses at the box office.""Central Intelligence"" is a classic buddy cop film (CIA agents and everything else) starring two of the personalities most influential and striking of North America, Johnson and Hart - MTV Awards 2016 was presented by them and will be together in the remake of ""Jumanji"" next year - must save the world of a corrupt cartel that threatens the global economy. It doesn't seem a very original plot, nevertheless, it is the impact of its protagonists that makes spectators buy one ticket to see it. I did it and discovered the truth.Directed and partly written by Rawson Marshall Thurber, the story saturates a cliché argument with predictable and ridiculous plot twists, but which undeniably is fun. Chemistry of the pair is not brilliant nor funny like Poehler and Fey, nevertheless, they successfully establish their connection and dazzle talent and joy. Well made jokes and a few unexpected cameos molded the surprises of the film, but it is not enough to hide the doubtful development. Accept it, Hart and ""The Rock"" do not have enough material to keep a comedy that abuses its duration (1 hour and 47 minutes), that only manages McCarthy, maybe, it would have been better a lenght lighter and shorter.20 years ago, Calvin Joyner (Hart) -nicknamed ""The Golden Jet"" - was the star student and champion of guys, therefore, he is commemorated by the sycophant director in front of school, such attention is diverted by an atrocious action, an psychological aggression on the personality of Bob (Johnson), overweight boy is victim of school bullying and he is thrown naked in front of hundreds of teenagers; that's where Calvin gives him his jacket so that covers up himself, the guy comes out as grateful as sadden by the event, the first encounter of a disorting friendship. Currently, the boy with the future more promising, works as an accountant, has a humble house and lives with his wife Maggie (Danielle Nicolet). The guys at school have organized a meeting for all students of that period, which do not like Calvin on account of his drastic change of life and his abrupt change of thought. Social networks are a viable link to meet people, Calvin knows it and decides to accept an invitation from Facebook, having a night of drinks with his renewed friend from high school. Starting from there, it unfolds the meet of their lives, what do you do, where do you live, with whom; Stone manages to stay in the house of his friend, he realizing that it CIA would come to the following day claiming that his friend of the last night is a dangerous criminal.Thurber carried out an acceptable work, a comedy that we've already seen before full of unnecessary twists and a few funny jokes starring by the real stars, ""The Rock"" a brawny with much, much talent and Hart a little guy with much, much inventiveness. It was not a disappointment, but the pieces did not fit together in the filmic puzzle.",Central Intelligence
93,monkeysgalore,It All Depends On What You Like,10,14 November 2018,"As with so many other films like this, I went in expecting to like it, but also prepared myself for the fact that it may be disappointing, as The Rock and Kevin Hart both often put out hit-or-miss films, but this one greatly surpassed my expectations, and I thoroughly enjoyed it.But I have to say, I was surprised at how much I liked this, especially since I ended up liking it more than I expected or wanted to going in. This really just looked like another raunchy, foul-mouthed, shoot-em-up movie that the 2010s so consistently produce, and while this film is no exception, it does all of the aforementioned elements with style. It really is just another fun, buddy action comedy that really soars because of the chemistry and gravitas brought by the two main stars.The story follows Kevin Hart as a high school jock/heartthrob who grows up to become a boring accountant who married his high school sweetheart. Dwayne Johnson was an overweight, geeky high school student who had one, embarrassing encounter with Hart's character, and he eventually reaches out and contacts Hart's character through Facebook years later. The two meet up at a bar, and they hit it off, but both realize how different the other is. It turns out that Johnson's character is a rogue CIA agent who was framed, and now he's running from his own people to stop the and guys and prove his innocence, but he needs Hart's accounting expertise to pull off his plan. What follows is a string of well-directed and edited action set pieces, along with often uproariously funny comedic moments, with some character development in between.This is a certain kind of movie for certain kinds of people, and not everyone will like it...not everyone has to. It really comes down to wether or not you like at least one of the two main actors, and wether or not you're ok with Hart's loud, at times obnoxious motormouth character who is unprepared for the intense, fast-paced action-packed scenarios that Dwayne Johnson's intense, likable character throws him into. If you're not a fan of loud, sometimes annoying, sometimes slapstick comedy, or over-the-top, fast-paced and occasionally brutal action sequences, then this movie isn't for you.There's a surprising amount of slick action in this film, although I shouldn't have been surprised since The Rock's in it. Several memorable scenes include the bar fight scene, office shootout/fight, garage fight scene, compound shootout scene, parking garage shootout, and final fight. I honestly expected less, but this film gave me so much more, and as an action fan, I was quite pleased. I often find that low expectations make for better enjoyment.About the comedy, this is actually a hilarious movie. I laughed out loud many times, and still do, when I rewatch certain scenes (they were that entertaining). The bar and airport scenes in particular still make me crack up, and I find that not many comedies manage to achieve consistently funny jokes throughout, let alone jokes that make you laugh just as hard upon rewatching them. Even if you're not a huge fan of Kevin Hart screaming and talking really fast, the Rock is funny and charismatic enough to make it watchable.This is the first Kevin Hart movie that I've seen, and I've only seen The Rock in one or two other films where he wasn't a main character, but if both of them are making movies like this, I would like to see more of them then.",Central Intelligence
94,BigGuy,Action/Comedy Buddy Cop Movie (Minor Spoiler only),8,14 June 2016,"I just saw a sneak preview of Central Intelligence, and I really haven't had such laughs for a long time. Kevin Hart plays Calvin ""Golden Jet"" Joyner who peaked in high school, and now is an accountant who can't seem to win. Enter the Rock (Dwayne Johnson) as Bob Stone aka Robbie Weirdicht who acts like a man-child with hero worship for Calvin. They were never really friends, but Calvin was the only one who didn't laugh when Robbie Weirdicht was humiliated in front of the whole senior class, and actually helped him out.Kevin Hart does a great job through the first half of the movie playing the straight man while the Rock hams things up. While the Rock's role is over-the-top, he plays it with such sincerity, it's absolutely a riot to watch. I usually don't like when a character's embarrassing behavior is the point of the comedy, but in this case it really works well.The plot twist arrives relatively early on (minor spoiler), when the CIA shows up and tells Calvin that ""Bob Stone"" is a rogue operative. For the rest of the movie Calvin is freaking out because he is caught between the CIA and his old high school acquaintance. Calvin has to figure out who to believe, as both sides tell the same story, with slight critical differences.Amy Ryan does a great job as the cold CIA operative, Agent Pamela Harris, trying to hunt done Bob Stone. She has the sharp dead-pan act down, which lets Kevin Hart play his usual loud squirming act.There are a number of action scenes, but frankly they are over way too quickly. Sure it makes ""Bob Stone"" look super impressive in how quickly he can dispatch adversaries, but I prefer actually being able to see the action, and appreciate the skills involved.Overall, I really enjoyed the movie, and judging from the laughter and smiles on the preview audience leaving the theater, I wasn't the only one.",Central Intelligence
95,MinistryofDoom,Dear Kevin Hart: We've seen this movie before. It's called Ride Along.,5,15 October 2016,"Guy gets mixed up with the goings-on of a law enforcement agent. He goes through some zany wacky off-the-wall stuff during their buddy- cop style adventure together. Both guys learn something new and come to realizations about their lives. Guy who isn't a law enforcement agent becomes best buds with the law enforcement agent and eventually joins the same profession....and repairs his relationship with the girl that's so smoking hot, no one outside the movie would actually believe that she's into him.If this sounds like Ride Along.....and Ride Along 2, that's because it is. But guess what? It's also Central Intelligence which ironically lacks intelligence...and originality. C'mon, Hart. We got it. You made a lot of money off of Ride Along 1/2 and you're trying to cash in on the same formula. We got it. Central Intelligence is EXACTLY like Ride Along 1/2 only instead of Ice Cube playing a detective, Keven Hart's co-star is Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and he is playing a CIA Agent, not a cop. Now, this movie would be great entertainment....if we hadn't already seen it before....literally THIS YEAR (Ride Along 2 came out on January 15, 2016). Now, if you can get past that, you'll be treated to a movie in which Kevin Hart, the professional comedian, is out-shined in literally every scene that he's in with Dwayne Johnson, who is funnier and more entertaining than Kevin Hart. Make no mistake, Johnson is the scene-stealer in this film. When you walk out at the end of Central Intelligence, you'll be hard pressed to remember anything Kevin Hart did but you will most certainly remember most of Johnson's scenes because they're funnier and far more memorable than anything Kevin Hard does in this film. It's kind of sad when you're a professional comedian and the co-star who isn't a professional comedian is funnier than you are. Johnson put a lot of effort into his work in this film and it really shows. Kevin Hart is just Kevin Hart reacting to stuff. Hell, that should be a Youtube channel, not a Hollywood film, but what do I know? Expect a lot of fat jokes, racism, bathroom humor and scene-stealing cameos by Jason Bateman, Aaron Paul, and Melisa McCarthy.",Central Intelligence
96,SpoilerAlertReviews,"""A little Hart and a Big Johnson""",7,30 June 2016,"So, two of my favourite celebrities I follow on Instagram come together for director Rawson Marshall Thurber's Central Intelligence. (Dodgeball, We're The Millers) I mention Instagram because this was how I first heard of the film in the making. Actually seeing the crazy, fun antics the two were pulling off on the set, photobombing each other, some of it making the blooper reel at the end credits. I think they may have had too much fun on set because it shows on screen which unfortunately makes me think they didn't take the film seriously, or, was having too much of laugh, and how is that a bad thing? Hart plays the popular, successful high school kid Calvin Joyner AKA the Golden Jet, who shows an act of kindness to bubbly, bullied, overweight Robbie Whierdicht, yes, pronounced 'weird dick' at High School. Fast forward twenty years to present day and Joyner is not the success everyone thought he would be and Robbie, well, he becomes Bob Stone AKA The Rock who happens to be an agent at LARGE for the CIA. The two of them create a superb and very funny relationship which is reminiscent of Crystal and De Niro in Analyse This and That. The therapy session is hilarious and there's plenty of laugh- out-loud moments. Johnson's character being larger than life, donning that famous fanny-pack he so got ripped for in real life and having an underestimated sneakiness that would put Batman and Turturro's Emilio Lopez to shame. Hart, doing what he does best, venting funny frustrations whilst continually trying to figure out what the hell is going on. The film is loaded movie references that sound like sly digs at fellow actors and there's plenty of in movie jokes and actually seems strange seeing Johnson as more stupid than serious. He's like a big kid, and I mean BIG. It has a poor plot but it serves the purpose of the film, script too and I reckon a lot is ad-libbed, mostly by Hart. Action is fast paced, sometimes too fast but it's entertainingly good but just not enough of it. The film spends a lot of time jumping from potential plot twist to another; it's not entirely predictable and has a good couple of surprise cameo appearances. (Don't read the tags at the bottom if you don't want to know who) and it didn't drag for the 107 minute running time. I think some of the casting could have been better, especially with Warner Bros and Universal joining forces for the first time in twenty years. Amy Ryan's (Gone Baby Gone, Birdman) Pamela Harris seemed too much of a copy of Bourne's Pamela Landy played by Joan Allen. There were loads of opportunities for more cameos that could have made this film even more fun.There's obviously a good 90s retro soundtrack that doesn't feel that old, but damn, 20 years ago; and there's a hint of a good score which is a collaboration between Ludwig Göransson (Creed, We're The Millers) and Theodore Shapiro (Walter Mitty, Spy) tracks from the soundtrack including House of Pain's Jump Around and En Vogue's My Lovin'. It's certainly not a film to take too seriously, though not considered a spoof. It would sit next to Spy on my shelve and though not as funny as Spy it's certainly better than a lot of comedies out there and I wouldn't mind seeing a sequel. Running Time: 8 The Cast: 5 Performance: 6 Direction: 7 Story: 6 Script: 6 Creativity: 7 Soundtrack: 8 Job Description: 8 The Extra Bonus Points: 10 for the therapy session and being good sports, it shows in the bloopers.71% 7/10",Central Intelligence

98,troy-manatunga,This summer funny is both big and small. Don't Miss out!!,7,28 June 2016,"Does comedy need to essentially have an engaging plot or just the level energy to keep the audience engaged? I have done this long enough to say that keeping the interest irrespective of the genre is a focal factor to the championing of a motion picture. With a juvenile burlesque plot, the prattling Kevin Hart and infamous Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnsons', CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE is now here. Months of snapchat teasers, previews and interviews the greedily awaited summer hit CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE does not disappoint. Kevin Harts – Calvin is the homecoming king, valedictorian and all round good guy who is seemingly the ultimate student to walk through the halls of Central High School and he is expected to go to finer places –possibly governor or maybe even president. Dwayne Johnsons – Bob Stone (He hates bullies! Wonder how that happened!) on the other side of the coin is a largely built student that is bullied all through high school life. While Calvin is praised at his final assembly by the school principal Bob fins himself facedown butt naked (literally) and is never seen in school again. Twenty years later things seem to have panned out differently as Calvin has been sucked into the rat race of life with a desk job as an accountant. A random Facebook friend request changes everything.The essence of the comedy – Kevin Hart is the todays King of Comedy. He is always at his best when he teams up with screenplays with just one other leading role. RIDE ALONG 1, RIDE ALONG 2, GET HARD & THE WEDDING RINGER are his most noteworthy work so far that has left us with aching sides from laughter. The liveliness that he brings and his motor mouth is right up where it should be. Dwayne Johnson who has featured in more roles in the past years than Hart plays off this energy and is ridiculously entertaining. The ability of the A-Listers to play off against each others energy is what distracts the audience from the weak screenplay. This to me is greatest part of the movie. They are in sync and no one overpowers the other with their performances – This is perfect chemistry.The director of WE ARE THE MILLERS Rawson Marshall Thurber has done it again. He does justice to the advertising hype created by its campaign leading up to the release of CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE. Hats off to good comedy!This summer funny is both big and small.

99,rutzelb,Silly but has its moments,5,10 November 2016,"Calvin Joyner (Kevin Hart) meets Bob Stone (Dwayne Johnson) who used to be known as Robbie Weirdicht a 300-pounder in High School, who was also embarrassed in the last Assembly when he was tossed naked onto the gym floor. As Bob Stone he looks like Mr. America. Bob needs Calivin's help to track down a meeting with someone known as the Black Badger who is trying to buy information that would harm the United States. CIA chief Harris (Amy Ryan) tells Calivin that Bob Stone is a Rogue Agent and must be captured. Later Bob Stone tells Calivin he is not a Rogue Agent. Calvin is confused. This is very silly in parts but it does have it's moments that will bring chuckles from most. Kevin Hart is funny, but he does overact a little too much. Dwayne Johnson can be funny at times, but even in here he has his silly moments and some of them are actually funny. There are a lot of funny, well coordinated, and choreographed sight gags. Seems they must have used Jackie Chan's choreographers. Kudos.Notables: Aaron Paul as Phil, Bob Stone's former partner; Melissa McCarthy as Darla, Robbie's um Bob Stone's love interest from high school; and Jason Bateman as Trevor who was the one who threw Robbie onto that gym floor in high school. The ending when Bob Stone takes off all his clothes at the High School Reunion was a complete disaster and totally unnecessary. It was not funny and you only saw him from the waist up. Now the really funny parts of this movie are in the out-takes when the credits run. HA ! (5/10)Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: Yes, Robbie's backside.

100,autisticreviewers,Autistic Reviewers Opinion Of This Movie.,7,3 July 2016,"It was hard to accept that Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson were going to be in a movie together. The thought of them having good chemistry....it just never worked for us! However...we were proved wrong again! Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson have excellent chemistry as not only high school buddies, but as a team to work together to bring down the main villain! The first segment of the movie shows us what happened to Bob Stone (Dwayne Johnson) in school and he he was humiliated and bullied in front of the whole school. Calvin (Kevin Hart) was the only one that really looked out for him or helped him. Now years later Bob Stone sends a facebook message to Calvin asking him if he wants to hang out again like old times. Calvin accepts and they both have a fantastic night. Little does Calvin know what is installed for him: Bob Stone is CIA Agent and needs Calvin help to locate the main Villain behind all of this.Dwayne Johnson is actually really good at comedy. His comedy shines during the first half of the movie, but during the second half Kevin Hart steals the show with his comedy by being over the top and having that high pitched voice we all know and love! The comedy..well..there's hit and misses when it comes to the comedy in this movie, but luckily it is saved by the emotional and heartwarming message of this film, which is that bullying is wrong and you should be accepted no matter who you are and no matter what you do. Normally this does not work in many comedies, but luckily it works here. There were missed opportunities throughout this movie, and it could have been longer and dug deeper within the two main characters, but it is what it is and it gets the job done.All in all, it's a very watchable movie. Heart breaking, emotional and very funny in certain scenes (especially a scene involving a counseling session).

101,danielharden,Ride Along 3: A little Hart and a big Johnson,4,1 July 2016,"From the guy behind Dodgeball: a true underdog story and We're the Millers comes another Buddy Cop/Spy comedy starring Kevin Hart. Central Intelligence marks the second time this year that we have seen Kevin Hart in a movie where he forms an unlikely friendship with his nicknamed co-star (Ice Cube or The Rock) while he also shoots, fights and back flips his way to save the day.As opposed to Ride Along, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson plays Bob Stone in a subverted role than one might expect of the peoples champ. The Rock does a pretty good job as the Optomistically enthusiastic, unicorn loving CIA agent, bringing the action star to the screen as well as a more softer and comical side of the Brahma Bull. The film also features entertaining performances/ cameos from several actors; such as Aaron Paul (Who can't stop himself from calling someone a Bitch), Jason Bateman (Who plays a more comical version of his character from The Gift), Amy Ryan and even Melissa McCarthy. As for Kevin Hart, Kevin Hart is Kevin Hart... Enough said.The film itself is formulaic, two polar opposites bond over a case they work together... The formula of every buddy cop movie out there. At the close the Rock gives a speech bout being who you are and standing up t bullies, if the film could have maybe delivered that message better or at all then we could be looking at a better film here. The film just felt a bit bland story line wise.My biggest issue with this film is that it feels censored. I can't help but feel that with 2 major studios backing the film that there must be some major studio interference taking place. There are many scenes that I felt didn't work because of cuts and edits to create a 12A film in the hope to widen the films audience. This is a film that definitely needed a certificate boost to be more entertaining, the humour needed to be ruder for Kevin Hart to work and the action needed more blood and detail to grip an audience. The film just felt tame and too safe and so not particularly entertaining, plus the ending was cheesy as hell God Damn.Overall Central Intelligence is a film that I feel was ruined by studio interference. The high point is definitely the Rock (but when is he not?) as he plays a different character to what you would expect pretty well. The story is unoriginal and the humour works on occasion but ultimately the film falls flat. What this film needs is a 15 rated Directors cut which I pray Rawson Marshall Thurber releases. The film isn't good but on the bright side it doesn't look like it has completely hit Rock Bottom.",Central Intelligence
102,stonedraim,"Intelligent, it should have been. Just a sitcom in a central seat (did I leave out the pun?)",5,23 July 2016,"**** May contain strong spoilers ****This is a review made by StoneDraim... and that means that if you want to read a probably different kind of review, keep reading....This is my personal experience, my personal point of view/perspective and my personal opinion... and my opinion is just one of like 7 billions in this world.The concept of a serious man living a silent life and a some kind of rogue man shaking things up, is knocking this motion picture up. At the beginning, Bob Stone (Dwayne Johnson) and Calvin Joyner (Kevin Hart) has a good separation and the viewer is led to the fact that this film can be one of the positive odd balls of the mentioned section in movies. A successful student in high school becomes an accountant and lives a ""normal silent life"". In comes a vivid and colourful character and the ""normal social life"" played out from Kevin Hart is taken too lightly and the situation becomes a parody spelling Dwayne Johnson. As the both story and the film develops, the characters is, sadly, thrown right into the fire of cliché and parody. Kevin Hart is fighting to give his ridiculous character life, and Dwayne Johnson should have been treated more professional from the director. Mr. Johnson ""The Rock"" can act, the director just has to push him further and harder. Anyhow, as in ""all of these kind of silly dumb sitcoms movies"", ""Central Intelligence"" should have been in the central of intelligence (pun intended). With that, the audience could have gotten a great movie. Instead, it is like; ""Here we go; another sitcom movie. Laugh hard and laugh....now! Laugh now!"" Too bad. An example; the therapy scene about 54 minutes into the movie. And... to top it off like frosty on a cake tasting real bad and cheesy; Melissa McCarthy!Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart and Melissa McCarthy should be given a chance to prove themselves in serious movies. And Jason Bateman. One good and fine actor, sadly placed within sitcoms and ""funny"" movies. He should really be given some block buster chances, 'cause he can deliver. I am confident of that fact.A tip. Take a look after ""The End"" and the fire deparpment arriving. If you want a taste of ""acted bloopers""; look further after ""The End"". The concept of ""Why?"" and ""Weird"" comes into my mind.Enough of bad critique. There is some entertainment and more than 5 really great laughs in ""Central Intelligence"". Is about 5 honestly and excellent laughs enough? You tell me. One good one liner delivered by Trevor (Jason Bateman): ""Get your a...ole of my door!"" Movie references throughout and all over the place. From ""Roadhouse"" to ""Snake Gyllenhaal"".Over to the movie as a product: - The production : Almost good. A few major errors and goofs that drags ""Central Intelligence"" down a lot, both in quality and for the rate. Could have been good. - The actors : Give them an honest opportunity. - Entertainment : 20 minutes into the movie, entertaining. Then just... oh, well... - Age : 11.5,3 out of 10. (The final rate is based most on my own entertainment of the movie. Short elucidation of the rating: 6 Nice production. Good movie. 5 Approved.)",Central Intelligence

106,goolizap,Twizard Rating: 89,9,3 August 2016,"We haven't really gotten a Kevin Hart film that is on par with his stand-up comedy. Heck, it's possible that we never will. Humorous reactions aside, he's a storyteller. And a very good one. Maybe writing a film will prove to be his fit, but for now, we get sporadic characters, mostly just thrown into comedic scenarios and told to swim. Fortunately, it hasn't hurt Hart's star quality and people still flock to the theaters to go see him. But still, we had yet to see him take on as compelling of a character as his role in Central Intelligence.Back in high school, Hart's character, Calvin, was the most popular guy in school. And 20 years later, he fears that his best days are behind him. His classmate, Bob (Dwayne Johnson), was an overweight kid who was horrendously bullied all his life. In school, Calvin was the only one who was nice to him, and Bob developed somewhat of an obsession with Calvin. Which would be creepy if Bob wasn't a tough CIA agent.Throughout, you're never quite sure whether or not you trust Bob--which could probably be avoided if the filmmakers didn't want it to happen so badly. But it's fine, since it makes the experience more enjoyable for us as well.The film wants Johnson's character to be the central figure, but Hart's is far more interesting. The struggles he deals with are touched upon briefly early on, but mostly forgotten about as the film progresses.The chemistry between Hart and Johnson is a brilliant discovery and one that hopefully sees the light of day again. The fact that Johnson isn't a comedian works in the film's favor. The writers can do what they do best and fully invent a whole new person without having to rely on the stylings of an already-established comedian. That job is reserved for Hart.The character the writers create for Johnson is hilarious. And he commits fully to it. His Facebook page states that he loves unicorns and guns. In person, it's apparent he also loves fanny packs.Director Rawson Marshall Thurber has fun with these little idiosyncrasies. He knows what the audience will react well to. Even the subtle stuff.The plot isn't too complicated. It tries to be, and it's appreciated, but it mostly consists of a format that has proved to work time and time again. We won't complain. Nor can we. And luckily, there's just enough to it to show that this is more than just a vessel for two stars.For perhaps the best Kevin Hart film to date, the laughs aren't over-the-top the whole time, but usually you'll at least have something to smile about. It's entertaining from beginning to end.Twizard Rating: 89",Central Intelligence

112,sujanfaster,Of Muscles and Fun,8,20 June 2016,"Dwayne Johnson is back! Oh wait he was never gone. We get to see so much of The Rock every year these days and we seldom complain. Because, TheRock knows what works, what people love and how to engage with them so that they love it before they know it. Central Intelligence is no different. The publicity campaign buy both Rock and Hart throughout the making of this movie is a movie in itself. Central Intelligence is a perfect example of how to make a cliché Hollywood buddy comedy work. After directing the R rated epicly funny We're The Millers, Rawson Marshall Thurber looks to target a larger diversity of the audience with this PG13 flick.We all know there is no point in discussing the storyline of the movie. It was all pretty obvious from the trailer. This is the type of movie that delivers what it promises. If you take your logical and serious brain with you, you are to be disappointed. I went to watch an out and out entertainer and I got one. There are all kinds of funny moments in this movie, the outrageous action comedy, subtle funny one liners, stupid stunts and what not. Of course it is not a perfect movie, editing could have been better, the spy angle of the storyline could have been more complex and you can go on. But hey, as long as it is entertaining, who is complaining.Kevin Hart can make a monk laugh if he wants to. He is just too good. He practically lifts the whole movie. I am finding it hard if anyone other than Kevin Hart could have made this movie the way it is. It is good to see Dwayne Johnson is finding different dimensions to his acting. He has tried his best to be funny is all I can say, but what he does better is kicking ass and making Kevin Hart's character do what he does. Amy Ryan is the only other actor who has a significant screenspace apart from Rock and Hart and she is okay as the stern faced CIA agent. Aaron Paul makes a guest appearance and even a third grade kid can guess what happens with his role.Central Intelligence may be yet another Hollywood bromance comedy, but it is all worth the price of your ticket.",Central Intelligence
113,tyson-hunsaker,"""It'll make a boss story.""",6,20 November 2016,"""Central Intelligence"" was a film I was mildly excited for after seeing the trailer. It looked like it had potential and some laughs.The film packs a solid comedic punch with a charismatic performance from Dwayne Johnson and some clever, comedic gags to pop culture. If you pick up on them, it'll add a lot to you for the not so brilliant script. The story's strongest point is its guessing ""who's the good guy"" which also might be its weakest flaw. While some will enjoy that element, others might find it annoying to constantly be guessing who these characters really are and where they stand. Should hold your interest though. Overall, Central Intelligence wasn't disappointing. It's comical and definitely a good time at the movies. However, if you're expecting the comedy highlight of the year, this isn't it.

114,KATO-SUBZERO,Good Action comedy. 1 Thumb Up,8,19 June 2016,"18 June 2016: I saw Dwayne Rock Johnson & Kevin Hart in their new action comedy and it was really good. I knew that Kevin Hart would be funny and that is what the audience is expecting from him, but the surprise stand out is action actor tough guy Dwayne Rock Johnson, who proved in this movie and in a movie he did several years ago titled ""The Game Plan"" with cute little actress, Madison Pettis in year 2007 that he can really transform from tough guy to letting himself go and be really good in a comedy film.The really cute actress who plays Kevin's wife, Danielle Nicolet African American looks like a younger version of Italian American actress television host, Juliana Rancic.All of Dwayne scenes were funny and on point. He looked very natural. I would give this film a 10, but the only reason, I will not give it a ten is because of some of the unnecessary profanity. This movie would have been just as funny without the cursing. Nice cameo by Melissa McCarthy.",Central Intelligence

Contrasting that, Kevin Hart, someone who never moved my needle any, truly showed quite a bit of good stuff. I think it's fair to say he saved the show. He showed a good deal of range without the 'feets do your stuff' eye rolling I was half expecting. Rock's character just isn't believable or likable. He varies from wheedling to bullying to whatever. The plot is supposed to have a bit of tension about who the bad guy is and toward the end throws Jesse Pinkman in as Jesse Pinkman for those Breaking Bad fans everywhere. The ending left, to say the least, a very bad taste. It pure embarrassment amped up ten times. There were any number of dignified ways to wrap this one up but the director choose the least appealing. Appealing? It was appalling. A minor diversion made at least somewhat worthwhile due to Hart's character. Else, nothing much and surely NOT a place for a Rock fan.",Central Intelligence
116,fluturoj,A warm movie with a good message trying to fight bullying that makes you laugh.,5,18 April 2017,"Real-life lesson: You never know how long something you do or say to someone stays with that person. Being horrible to someone in high school can affect them through out their life. And you don't know how obsessed someone can become with you, you might not realise the impact you leave on people. Plausibility: The aim of this movie is not to be plausible so let's not get into it. Bullying affects people, that is plausible so let's leave it with that. Also overliking the only person that has shown kindness to you also is plausible. Storytelling: Slow at the beginning but takes off well. Has its interesting moments when you don't know if Bob is a good or a bad guy. Character development: Jet is the only one that develops a bit realising that his life is not a failure. We already know what motives Bob and what has affected him and make him who he is so much character development is not needed.Acting/Casting: Both are amazing and have an amazing chemistry. At the beginning I feel like the rock had a bit trouble portraying this goofy warm hearted kid even after 20 years but it gets better towards the end.

117,captainmike-michael,Great Chemistry between Johnson and Hart,8,17 June 2016,"Forget about the formulaic spies plot and its flaws, the film does not look silly for the wise decision of making it into a comedy and it sparks thanks to the strong rapport between Johnson and Hart. The thriller may seems to be dumb and lack of inventiveness in all the right ways but it is also a bit smarter than what audiences could have expected. The hilarious but not nonsense actions, sweet high- school buddies friendships, comedy about bullies and inspiration to transform a better oneself however are all blended well into this lack-of-originality thriller; though insufficient to generate big humors, it is still able to keep your smile till the end. The film centralises on the delightful chemistry between the two actors, both Hart and Johnson deliver a cheerful bromantic, especially the latter who takes his character and silliness seriously other than just knowing to flex muscles. It might lack in depth to explain about the quest of the mission but it is overall entertaining due to the commitment of the cast to bring us laughter.",Central Intelligence

I don't normally laugh out loud in a cinema, and this had me chortling throughout. Many other reviews explain the story and the 'chemistry' between the two main actors. But what really struck me is what a fine actor Dwayne Johnson is. I guess all those years in WWF have paid off. In the movie he plays two very different people, and very believably. He switches effortlessly from one role to another, and can really bring menace to his part. His comedic side was excellent, playing the over-enthusiastic buddy, and delivering banalities with such sincerity you almost forgot it was scripted. Well written, though sometimes Hart's black shtick was a bit overdone, nicely paced after a slow start, and really good fun that doesn't take itself too seriously. Great date film, she'll love you for it :)",Central Intelligence
119,asandor,An enjoyable but slightly bland Comedy,6,15 March 2017,"Central Intelligence follows Calvin Joyner (Kevin Hart), a once popular high schooler, who twenty years later works a dead end accounting job, is having small marital issues, and is unhappy with his life. Calvin receives a message from an old peer Bob Stone (Dwayne Johnson), who was overweight and bullied in high school. Calvin agrees to meet with him, as an impending high school reunion approaches and he worries about what people will think of him.Stone, however, has changed drastically in many ways. Although still awkward and weird, he is now fit (this is Dwayne Johnson we are talking here). Calvin and Stone go out for beers, but Calvin begins to suspect something isn't right when Stone asks him for help with some odd accounting abnormalities. Soon, the CIA is hunting Calvin and Bob as they race to stop a nefarious plot, and Calvin can't decide whether he should trust Bob Stone, or trust the CIA.Central Intelligence was a fairly enjoyable film in many ways. I personally really enjoy Dwayne Johnson as a modern action/comedy star. He continues the trend set by Arnold Schwarzenegger, as a goofy but lovable action hero. Hart was also adept in the film, offering good bits of comedy, and some good acting. Unfortunately, the characters in the film are one dimensional, and not fleshed out well. Johnson's awkwardness seems forced and awkward in itself. Hart is often useless and listless in the film. Many of the side characters suffer from similar lack of character.The film itself was fun, and had some good humour in it. As previously mentioned, I enjoy Johnson in film, and find he has great on screen charisma and tact. The film was carried throughout by his acceptable comedy performance, and some over the top action scenes. However, some of these scenes were certainly forced, ridiculous or cheesy to the point of disbelief.This film was a mixed bag, as can be scene. It is an excellent ""popcorn"" film, with little substance to it, but one that will offer a few laughs. It never feels boring or contrived, and is perfectly watchable throughout. However, weak characters, a weak plot, some petty comedy and some poor action result in a mediocre film. Johnson carried the film for me personally, but this will certainly not be the case for everyone. This film is viewable and fun in certain instances, but offers little else of value. A weak 6/10.",Central Intelligence

121,yourfavoritecritic,So Average it's Bad,3,3 November 2020,"Central Intelligence stars Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart and is directed by Rawson Marshall Thurber who is best known for his work on We're the Miller's which was a 2013 comedy I actually quite enjoyed, however his latest efforts with this film proved to not be as successful. First off this movie is about Calvin, a former popular kid in high school turned bank account, and after realizing that his life may have peaked in high school, an individual from his past re-enters his life. I didn't really know what to expect from this movie, on one hand I was hoping for the best as I am fan of Kevin Hart's standup and Dwayne Johnson can be hysterical as well, but nothing from the trailer made me laugh and for the most part so did the movie.The jokes in the movie didn't feel all that clever and I felt as if someone sucked all the life out of this movie. It felt like completely soulless while telling its simple, straight forward story. Apart from its unoriginality I did enjoy the chemistry between Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart, I felt like they bounced off each other well, also one reoccurring thing that did make me chuckle a few rimes was how The Rock's characters would appear out of nowhere in certain places, I thought that that was cleverly funny. It's unfortunate this movie suffers from a tired story, as like I said before, the two leads did seem to have great chemistry, I would like to see the pair team up again in another comedy that would possibly offer a bit more laughs. Now this movie proved to me one thing I was afraid to admit and that is Kevin Hart's overexposure, he plays the same character in this film that he does in every other movie and honestly, it's starting to wear thin. Some of his quick quips are starting to get old/very predictable and as an actor he should be scared, no audience wants be able to predict how the punchline of a joke will go. Comedy is all about being unpredictable and spontaneous in the right context and sadly that is starting to fade for Kevin Hart. Overall Central Intelligence is just another cash grab of a comedy, that felt as lifeless as the next cheap comedy. I did not enjoy myself all too much and probably would have much rather have watched Ride Along because at least Ice Cube is pretty funny. I don't how much I'd recommend this film as it's something you have to see for yourself and honestly I just didn't really connect with the movie, with that being said Central Intelligence gets a 3/10.",Central Intelligence

123,bartonj2410,A little Hart and a big Johnson really does go a long way,6,16 June 2016,"Other than having one of the best taglines in recent memory, Central Intelligence also has two of the biggest names in the world of entertainment at its disposal; Dwayne Johnson is literally the most profitable movie star on the planet and Kevin Hart is the biggest name in comedy right now.I haven't been a massive fan of Kevin Hart's films to date but I've been a fan of Dwayne Johnson's ever since his days as The Rock in WWE, so I was looking forward to seeing how they would play off one another in Central Intelligence. I think we could be seeing a lot more of these two together in future films because they work together so well.Calvin Joyner (Kevin Hart) was the most popular kid at his high school, voted the most likely to succeed, who went by the nickname 'Golden Jet'. Twenty years later and Calvin is an accountant and married to his high school sweetheart, Maggie (Danielle Nicolet).Bob Stone (Dwayne Johnson) was the overweight geek that was endlessly targeted by bullies during his high school days. Twenty years later and Bob is a lean, mean killing machine for the CIA. Reuniting through Facebook, Bob drags Calvin into a world of international espionage in order to save the world.For a film like Central Intelligence, it's of great importance that they get two leads who are both likable and share a chemistry that makes the film work. This is very much the case in Central Intelligence, Hart playing the straight man with Johnson taking on the role of the goofball.We've already seen a great new double act this year with Russell Crowe and Ryan Gosling in The Nice Guys and, while Hart and Johnson never reach those heights, it's very similar in the way that, like Gosling in The Nice Guys, Johnson steals the limelight from his co-star. Johnson has always had a knack for comedy and seeing him like this is just so damn entertaining.Dawson Marshall Thurber, who directed Dodgeball and We're the Millers, continues to show that he knows his way around the genre of comedy, throwing in some action for good measure. After all, it wouldn't be a Dwayne Johnson film if there wasn't any action to be seen. There's also a little reference to something in Aaron Paul's past that you may recognise which got one of the biggest cheers in the film so, while it's almost impossible to miss, listen out for it.I have to applaud the film for trying to send out a message about bullying and the effects it can have on victims later in life. While some of it gets lost in the ridiculousness that plays out on screen, it's a message that's done a lot more subtly than the feminism agenda Bad Neighbours 2 pushed onto us.Central Intelligence is a comedy that doesn't try too hard to make you laugh or like the characters, a problem a lot of comedies face nowadays. However, thanks to the natural chemistry Hart and Johnson share plus the writing and direction of Thurber, Central Intelligence is a comedy that will leave you entertained, doing so with a large likability factor.",Central Intelligence
124,trooper5783,Absolutely hysterical! One of the summer's best yet!,9,30 June 2016,"Not being a Kevin Hart fan, I did not expect to laugh as hard as I did watching Central Intelligence, because I had my expectations so low to begin with. Almost everything in this buddy action comedy hits the right notes- the execution of the plot, the chemistry between the cast, the performances of the cast themselves(The Rock was the bomb!), the execution of the humor, the charming anti-bullying message(wasn't cringe-worthy like other movies), the film's goofy self-awareness, the creative action sequences and most of all, the way the two main characters interact. What makes this movie genuinely funny is the entertainment Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart provide with their energy while improvising(Hart's at his best with his stand-up, here) their jokes- the whole audience was laughing heartily and loudly throughout the movie mainly because of this reason. It sounds like I'm going too fair on this movie because people aren't raving on and on about it- but for how hard I laughed during this movie, I'll shift my rating to a 9, as such an accomplishment deserves such a rating, especially for this non-Hart fan.",Central Intelligence

Story wise, there are not going to be any big surprises. Much like other reviews, I can't help but feel this could have been much funnier. There's plenty to laugh at, certainly, but there wasn't anything that really had me out-of-breath laughing, either from a single joke or a part where there could have been a string of them.

Probably more than I should have, but I liked the message the movie was sending. Allow me to elaborate. Synopsis: Calvin Joyner was voted in high school the guy most likely to succeed. 20 years later he's an accountant. As his high school reunion approaches, he tries to make contact with his old schoolmates. And someone named Bob Stone contacts him. He says that he was known as Robbie Weirdicht in school. Calvin remembers that he was picked on, as a matter of fact after an extremely nasty prank he left school. They agree to meet and Calvin is surprised by how much he has changed. Bob asks Calvin to help him out. He says yes and the next thing he knows some men burst into his home. They're CIA, the one in charge is looking for Stone, she says he's a rogue agent. When they can't find Bob they leave. Later he approaches Calvin telling him, he is not a rogue agent, he's trying to find a person known as the Black Badger who is planning to sell some information that in the wrong hands can be disastrous. So he needs Calvin's help to stop him. Calvin's not sure whom he should believe.

The Rock and Kevin Hart are fantastic together and have some of the funniest jokes I've heard all year. Watching them both on screen is the best part of this movie and it was extremely funny. The story follows both of them having reunited 20 years after high school in order to save the world. The main plot is the weakest part of this movie since there's not much emphasis put on it.

133,blazedounal,This movie is not good or bad.,9,23 July 2016,"Here comes another buddy cop film, this time with Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart in the lead roles. The film does not look silly for the wise decision of making it into a comedy and it sparks thanks to the strong rapport between Johnson and Hart. It is not really funny, basically there is no one good laugh in the whole movie. But, there are many somewhat funny situations/lines, like when Rock and his little partner jump out the window onto a big balloon-monkey. It is not really fun, but, it is engaging enough to not be boring or just plain bad. The Rock kicks some but, but in a mostly-believable way and not too much. Acting is not really good, it's mostly over-acting, but, both the Rock and his little partner don't ""overdo over-acting"", so to speak. Again, it's a comedy, over-acting is somewhat expected. So there are a lot of better movies, but, this one satisfies the minimum quality bar. This movie is not good or bad. This movie starting is from the past 20 years ago. In 1996, extremely popular student and star athlete Calvin Joyner (Kevin Hart) is being honored at his high school's senior pep rally. His obese classmate Robbie Wheirdicht (Dwayne Johnson) is being bullied by a student named Trevor (Jason Bateman) while showering in the boys' locker room. Robbie is thrown into the gym naked by Trevor and his friends just as Calvin is receiving his award, and everyone erupts in laughter except for Calvin and his girlfriend Maggie (Danielle Nicolet). Calvin takes off his varsity jacket and gives it to Robbie, who covers himself up, thanks Calvin, and runs away in embarrassment. 20 years later, Calvin is married to Maggie and works as an accountant. He is dissatisfied with his career. He want to be back at high school. One day, Calvin receives a friend request on Facebook from a man named Bob Stone, who reveals that he is Robbie and requests that they meet at a bar. Calvin is shocked to see that Robbie has transformed into a tall, muscular, confident man. Robbie easily defeats a group of four men that try to bully them. As Bob drops Calvin off at his house, he asks Calvin to review a few accounting records, saying he has payroll issues. Calvin deciphers the records as multi-million dollar transactions from an auction, with the final payment set to be made the following day. Bob avoids Calvin's questions and ends up spending the night on his couch. The next morning, a group of CIA agents led by Pamela ""Pam"" Harris (Amy Ryan) arrive at Calvin's house in search of Bob, who escapes after erasing all evidence of his presence. Pam warns Calvin that Bob is a dangerous rogue agent who has the intention of selling satellite codes to the highest bidder. As the CIA agents follow Calvin to his office, Bob successfully abducts Calvin and explains that he is trying to stop a criminal known as the Black Badger from selling the satellite codes, but needs Calvin's skills as a forensic accountant to find the coordinates of the deal's location. However, Calvin did not believe in Bob. Calvin flees and calls Maggie, telling her to meet him at the marriage counselor's office. Pam intercepts him and informs him that Bob murdered his own partner Phil (Aaron Paul) and is the Black Badger himself. She warns him to refrain from telling Maggie and gives him a device to alert them to Bob's location. Bob met Calvin in building again. Bob convinces Calvin to help him. As they leave the building, Pam calls Calvin and threatens to arrest Maggie if he fails to help them detain Bob. Calvin is forced to betray Bob and the CIA arrests him. Calvin feels guilty and decides to help Bob. The two manage to escape successfully. They steal an airplane and fly to Boston where they can deal with Black Badger. At a park in Boston, Calvin guesses that the deal must be happening in an underground parking garage. Bob tells Calvin to stay outside and enters the garage alone. However, when he sees Pam entering the garage a short while later, Calvin mistakenly assumes that she is the Black Badger and runs after her. He finds Bob meeting with the buyer and claiming to be the Black Badger. Phil arrives, revealing that he is alive, and claims that he is the real Black Badger. The buyer attempts to retrieve codes from both Bob and Phil, but the CIA arrives and a shootout begins, while Calvin grabs both codes and runs outside. He encounters Bob and Phil, who engage in combat. Unable to decide who is the criminal, Calvin aims blindly and shoots Bob, allowing Phil to knock him out. Phil then confesses to being the Black Badger and reveals that Bob is innocent. Before Phil can kill Calvin, he causes a distraction and allows Bob to rip Phil's throat out, killing him. The two deliver the codes to Pam, who then drops them off to their high school reunion. Trevor attempts to bully Bob again, but Bob knocks him out with one punch. As Bob delivers his speech, he relives his most embarrassing high-school moment and takes off all his clothes confidently. He walks off stage to unite with his high school crush Darla and they share a kiss. During the ending credits, Maggie is revealed to be pregnant and Calvin has joined the CIA. As a gift for his first day, Bob returns to Calvin his varsity jacket from high school.",Central Intelligence

135,Bryan_Roderick,Could have been funnier.,6,5 July 2016,"Central Intelligence Directed by Rawson Thurber who you might remember directed DodgeBall and We're the Millers. Unlike DodgeBall, I probably laughed as many times as I did in We're the Millers. This of course isn't the directors fault but Ike Barinholtz's. The guy from MADtv, it was his first time really doing a major film and the jokes were too far and few in between. Dwayne Johnson plays a CIA agent who needs the help of his high school buddy to exonerate him. Johnson committed himself to being in character throughout the film and it really shows how far he's come as an actor. Kevin Hart plays Calvin Joyner, the popular kid in high school that peeked and is having trouble in his personal life now. He just wants to go back to the familiar lifestyle despite being brought in time and time again by Johnson. His performance was much better than in Ride Along 1 or 2. There are three surprise actors in the film that the trailer didn't show and they are each worth it. The dialogue was great, not funny, but much of it takes some references from TV and movie culture to understand. Something perhaps a teenager or elder might not get. I also want to mention that Danielle Nicolet was in the film as Calvin Joyner's wife. She does a wonderful job and is an under-appreciated actress in Hollywood. I recognized her from 3rd Rock from the Sun and as the wife from Key and Peele. Verdict: Watch the movie. Don't watch the trailer as it has many of the funny parts in it and would spoil it for you. The ending is good, but also predictable.",Central Intelligence
136,TheOvereducated,Very cool film!,10,29 February 2020,"I had a great time at the cinema (back in 2016). It's a very fun, action-comedy movie with a heartwarming core thanks to the very sweet character Johnson is playing :)There are 2 small details I didn't like. 1) With Johnson's character being actually innocent, the guilty smile & look he gave to Hart's character behind his back close to the end of the movie was out of character. And so the sole purpose of that smile was to trick the audience into still doubting about his innocence. I understand they wanted to keep the audience guessing until the big revelation at the end, but that was not the correct way. And 2) the real flashback scene between Johnson's and Aaron Paul's character during the revelation at the end felt cheap/weak, because Paul's actions were over-comical and thus unrealistic towards Johnson's character. They could have fixed that easily.Overall though, I can easily see beyond these details and as I said, I like the movie a lot and I like a lot that Johnson's character is all about stoping bullies!",Central Intelligence

139,christian-larson,Entertaining comedy,5,16 July 2016,"Central Intelligence stars Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson and its the story of how Kevin's Harts character teams up with The Rock for a CIA mission of some-kind. The best part of this film is the chemistry of the main leads. Kevin Hart and the Rock play each other really well and they seem to be having the most fun in this movie. But what this film fell apart for me is the ""intriguing"" story the film tries to tell. Its really dull and too complicated for its own. Besides that, the film is really funny and i think Kevin Hart steals the whole show. The Rock is fine but since his character is being bullied throughout the film and also in the past, the film does a lousy representing what i think is a good message, but its handled in the worst way possible and its really cliché. Also i don't know why but throughout the film, Kevin Hart does not want any part to do with the rock's plan, and it kinda seems that The Rock is a bad guy, and that was kind of weird at first. Then it kicked off where it started at the end based on the chemistry of the leads. Overall, the action well handled, its really funny at parts, and the actors play well with one another, but the story that the film tries to give us, its really bad. Also the overall message is important but not played well in this film. 6.5/10",Central Intelligence
140,kevin_newdirections,The hit-to-miss ratio is surprisingly higher than you expect.,7,23 June 2016,"When a film has a tagline as witty and sharp as Central Intelligence's – ""Saving the world takes a little Hart and a big Johnson"" — something tells me that the producers came up with that pun first and decided to commission a script around it after. True enough, this film is an excuse to have Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and Kevin Hart play delightfully silly characters amidst a fairly disposable plot. It really doesn't matter because you won't see this film for a complex plot, you'll see this film for some good laughs. The hit-to-miss ratio is surprisingly higher than you expect.In Central Intelligence, Johnson plays a formerly morbidly obese high school student named Robbie Wierdicht (yes, it's pronounced as Weird Dick, hah!) who was subjected to a horribly cruel prank twenty years ago. He now resurfaces as Bob Stone, a herculean CIA agent who decides to reunite with his only friend in high school, Calvin ""The Golden Jet"" Joyner (Hart) — back then Central High's ""most likely to succeed"" student. Ironically, he is now living an unexceptional adult life as a mid-level accountant stuck in a rocky marriage. Little does Calvin know, what started as a mysterious Facebook friend request to a casual catch-up is Stone's silent attempt to enlist Calvin as his unwilling sidekick in a deadly mission to track down stolen U.S. satellite codes and stop a wanted kingpin called the ""Black Badger"" from obtaining them.In his previous comedies (Ride Along and Get Hard), Hart is often portrayed as a fast- talking shtick at the center of attention. In this film, We're The Miller's director Rawson Marshall Thurber, who co- wrote the script with Bob Fisher and Steve Faber, breaks this stereotype by subduing Hart to a serious straight-up role and giving the goofy prankster role to Johnson (responsible for pulling off most of the verbal and physical gags). The role reversal works with the slapstick comedy thanks to both actors' exhilarating chemistry and sharp performance. Their size juxtaposition alone is a joke in itself. ""Pint-sized"" squeaky-voiced Hart, with all his outbursts and babbling, mixes panic and rage probably better than any actor. As for Johnson, he keeps up with expectations here whether by simply donning fanny packs, unicorn t-shirts, and uber-tight pajamas; or flaunting his cartoonish manliness against a character who is surprisingly sensitive and still embarrassed with his past. Central Intelligence is given more depth when it deals with our main characters' high school baggage – Calvin's frustration on his life turning not the way he expected, and Bob's self-esteem issues due to the serious and lasting effects of bullying.Don't get me wrong, the exhausting espionage plot struggles to have any shred of intelligence to it. It is quite perfunctory to the point that it might as well fade into a background noise. It even falls apart to utter nonsense by the end when the plot twist is revealed and judging by their focus on comedy, the filmmakers seems to be fine leaving the plot holes unpatched. Neither are the villains written with deep thought as they are all cardboard bad guys who are homophobes, bullies, mercenaries or a combination thereof. Apart from the comedy itself, the film apologizes in its shortcomings by boasting a roster of cameos that I'll leave unmentioned for the sake of surprise.You can groan at its dumb plot, get antsy over action scenes where no one (not even trained CIA gunmen) can shoot straight or frown at Calvin and Stone whispering strategies whilst pointed with guns, but Central Intelligence is hard to dislike because Johnson and Hart shine perfectly in their roles and hence, elevate this film from subpar to moderately enjoyable. Without them, this film will be as useful as a bag of rocks. That being said, Central Intelligence can be a good distraction during a hot summer day.",Central Intelligence
141,choatelodge,Missed opportunities,3,2 July 2016,"Saw this last night on the big screen, not expecting much but hoping to be entertained. Sadly that didn't happen. Why? I has to have been the movie's writing and the way it was directed. It just never got started, and while the actors' delivery in the various scenes had to have been what the director wanted, it just never rang true. I'll leave off any explanation of the plot and story line, others have done a great job at that. I'll just stick to what I feel are the failings of the directing and writing.The movie starts out well enough, we get the transformation of the formerly bullied fatty 'Rob Wierdich' into the now huge and muscular Rob Stone and how this man now re-enters the life of co-protagonist Calvin Joyner, a man whose great high school promise has in his own estimation fizzled. Stone is over-the-top enthusiastic and presumptive while Joyner plays the baffled and grudgingly accommodating nebbish. But it is carried on too long, straining for the laugh. Hart as Joyner goes from normal speaking voice to Chris Rock style falsetto screeching with apparently little provocation and Dwaine Johnson's Rob Stone plays his overplayed huge smile and light hearted repartee gag so often that it becomes tiresome and distracting.The mishandled opportunities in the movie get worse as it goes on. Late in the movie comes the anticipated high school reunion. The movie's makers seem to have had no idea how to tastefully or effectively tie it all up and make a satisfying conclusion to the story. The principal bully who has harassed and humiliated Stone throughout the movie could have been dealt his come-uppance in some turnabout humiliation of his own, and I was expecting and even looking forward to this. Instead the writers blew this chance and had Stone simply haul off and knock the far smaller man unconscious with a single blow to the head, in front of the whole crowd. Nice. Way to transform your hero.More disturbing by far is the next scene in which Stone takes the stage and while accepting an honor, begins to take off clothing. No... he's not going to... but yes. Not only do the writers have Stone strip off his shirt to show off his muscles in a display of vanity, they have him strip completely naked, to the ooo's and ah's of the assembled crowd, and then walk around like a regular dance attendee. What was the purpose of the full nudity? Are we supposed to believe that Stone has altered his genitalia to the better as well as his muscles? (while it isn't shown of course, the implication that Stone is totally nude is clear when Stone tries to hug Joyner and the latter says, ""Not now with your junk hanging out!""I'm not offended at the scene, but I really have to wonder what motivated the writers to think they were advancing the story arc with this uncomfortable and implausible gag. What were they thinking? It's just weird.Lots of action scenes, cool stunts, but the story was dealt a poor telling.",Central Intelligence
142,charliesonnyray,Surprisingly Fun,5,21 July 2016,"Recently a lot of Kevin Hart's movies have been pretty lack luster. The Ride Along movies and Get Hard were shredded by critics. When I saw the trailer for Central Intelligence, I thought this would be just another one of those flicks. Thankfully, I was very wrong! The page here lists the film as an ""action, comedy, crime"" movie but really it is more of a ""action, comedy, drama"" flick. Dwayne Johnson plays the gentle giant Bob Stone/Robby Weirdicht (haha pun) who works for the CIA while Kevin Hart plays the everyday joe Calvin Joyner (a nice change of pace in my opinion). These two are the reason this film works as pure entertainment. They have great chemistry together and they play rather interesting characters. Robby is on the same level as Jason Bourne when it comes to hand to hand combat and other spy stuff like that but he has the sensitivity and the tastes of a fourteen year old girl. I don't care who you are, you have to admit that's hilarious. Calvin was the favorite student of his high school but now he is just a washed up accountant upset with where his life has gone. Hart and Johnson bring some real comedy to their roles as well as true conviction. You can believe that these two are dealing with some real emotional problems. I never thought of either of them as good actors but they do a splendid job here. The stunts they pull also look so very realistic. They are very thrilling and pretty creative too. Now the movie isn't without problems-what movie is? The spy portion of the plot is pretty straight forward and shallow. It's obviously just an excuse to get these two together but is that really such a bad thing when what they are offering is so good? Central Intelligence is kind of like that movie Twins with Arnold Schwarzenegger and Danny Devito. Two popular actors play as comic foils to one another as well as provide great drama with some cool stunts thrown in. What more could you want?",Central Intelligence

145,CraigsCritique,The Little Hart and Big Johnson Surprise,7,19 July 2016,"Now I will state from the start that Kevin Hart as a comedian has never appealed to me and so therefore that also translates into his films having never been intrigued enough to go see one of his (some of the critical receptions bare this out) but this is obviously where that trend ends for me.In this 'mismatched' buddy action comedy both Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson seem to have stumbled upon some fabulous comedic chemistry that I most certainly didn't see coming.Having stated my indifference earlier to Kevin Hart I am at the opposite end of the spectrum when it comes to Dwayne Johnson, a man, an actor who probably shouldn't be as successful as he is...yet I can't resist his charms, there is just something inherently likable about the man as an on screen presence and as an actor in general and that is no different here.Quick plot synopsis now, flashback to high school, Hart is Mr. Popular, Johnson is the school joke, flash-forward twenty years to the present day where after a social media inspired meetup if would appear maybe that now the two have switched places in life (quite a common story arc) and what may also be certainly more concerning for Hart is the fact that Johnson may appear to be a spy on the run, so ensues a parade of nifty chase sequences some rather inspired and choreographed escape fighting scenes interspersed of course with Hart chipping in with comedic observations of their currently absurd predicament. There is in particular a scene where Johnson has replaced the role of a therapist who is about to give marriage counsel to Hart and his wife and it is extremely funny.This should not of entertained me as much as it did and trust me I am as surprised as anyone that it got many laughs out of me, it certainly does remind me in parts to 21 Jump Street, what I mean by that is it being a nice comedic surprise of a film that has the laughs but actually does in part also have a heart in place, or as the brilliant marketing department said on the films tagline and posters 'It takes a little Hart and a big Johnson' just superb.I was a little concerned after the films opening which I mentioned earlier is a flashback to high school where we see the rather unsubtle face of Johnson transposed onto the head and body of a rather overweight kid but the film got out of that just pure weird territory quicker than expected, yes not every joke hits the mark but the success to failure rate is amply way on the positive side of things and the pace and action is brisk enough that it never overstays its welcome which is very surprising given the near two hour feature length running time.But I suppose the main question that does have to be asked though is 'who is the Black Badger' maybe I'm the Black Badger, as Thomas Kretschmann brilliantly puts it.So it's not particularly going to change the comedic landscape out there but it more than succeeds in keeping you very entertained throughout mainly thanks to the great comedic chemistry that Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson bring to the party.",Central Intelligence

Some of the jokes are funny and it strives to have a positive message, but despite enjoying DJ as an actor, I found it unwatchable self conscious and sanitized. The whole thing felt very stiff & insincere, a movie with no heart (no pun intended). Trying painfully hard to be hip, like someone's boomer Leo dad in a midlife crisis trying to hang with the zoomer teens. The whole film has the cringe factor of a Michael Bublee cover album in a big box shoe store, or like watching a feature length Facebook ad.

148,pelhamc,What The Rock is Cooking Smells,3,25 October 2016,"Central Intelligence is a studio feature film in the bromance/buddy comedy genre. It's The D Train meets The In-laws. Kevin Hart (American History X, Kevin Hart) plays the straight man opposite Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson (Scorpion King, Expendables), reprising his gentle giant role from Pain and Gain. Like much of the jokes, Central Intelligence falls flat--not that there are many to go around.It's basically one joke repeated ad nauseam, a la Saturday Night Live. The Rock asks Kevin Hart ""Are you in?"" (a mad-cap adventure) to which Kevin Hart replies, ""No, I am definitely not in."" In a twist that outdid itself in stupidity, The Rock somehow becomes Kevin Hart and his clueless wife's marriage counselor. Central Intelligence was very 2016 in that it dealt with the ""body shaming."" The Rock was bullied as a youth, yet inexplicably he is still stuck in high school nostalgically and can't wait to hit the reunion. The Rock's lines were delivered with the enthusiasm of Ferris Beuhler's teacher, with McLovin style. He was better in true crime story Snitch. Kevin Hart is better doing stand-up. This is a good example of what the industry is buying in the comedy genre. Central Intelligence has themes of regaining lost youth with ""inappropriate"" behavior and finding redemption.

149,mother_of_popcorn,Don't Even Bother,2,13 July 2016,"One of my favourite things is when a film is a hybrid of genres – horror comedies, romantic comedies, dramedies and romantic dramas. Unfortunately, Central Intelligence is an action comedy which skimps on both the action and the comedy.This was disappointing for so many reasons, but mainly because expectations were high with the tagline for the film being such a stroke of genius: ""Saving the world takes a little Hart and a big Johnson"" (I do love a good pun). I can handle when a film is predicable in plot if it makes up for it in other ways, and I was hoping this one would have fresh jokes to counteract the cliché story however this is where it fell short. Kevin Hart's character Calvin Joyner is a straight-laced accountant who was once the high school golden child. He receives a Facebook request from a nerdy and overweight ex-classmate Bob Stone (played by Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson) and when they meet to catch up over drinks, Calvin is slowly drawn into a crime underworld where Bob is an ex-CIA agent gone bad or is he? (Cue dramatic music yawn).Kevin Hart plays the same character he always plays – whiney and a little nerdy, whilst Dwayne Johnson's character has a little more meat to it (and I don't just mean his biceps). Even though Bob had bulked up over the years, he maintains the soft and fluffy persona that his high school self once was. This was probably the only redeeming feature of the film which made it even remotely unique and interesting. With Ike Barinholtz as one of the screenwriters, you would think the film would have many more laughs than it did. I think the comedy was just too PG for my liking and with no amazing action sequences to boot, it became a dull journey where the only excitement I felt was when the closing credits began to roll.",Central Intelligence

Central Intelligence is a buddy cop film starring Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson. They both have exceedingly good chemistry in the film with Kevin being this guy who you can relate to after high school and Dwayne playing a socially awkward CIA agent. Both these two come together to take down a huge deal involving multiple countries. Although their chemistry is strong at first it begins to get awkward at times even for the audience and they can make you stray away from enjoying the movie. Some of their scenes feel forced and sometimes the movie can obsess too much into the spy stuff going on. In other words, most of the movie is good, and most of their relationship is great. Just be wary of the flaws the movie has. Video Review link is right here.

A terrible scene in the first minutes of the film where high school bullies throw a naked fat boy into the centre of a school ceremony. Not only do all the students laugh at this outrageous act but the school authorities seem to acquiesce in a kind of 'boys will be boys ' attitude.The same victim of bullying years later reappears now no longer fat but taller and with a well built body. He is also now apparently very attractive to girls who immediately throw themselves at him.Another nasty scene in a bar where he and his companion have to face some bullies and of course he proves himself to be an expert in unarmed combat.Wrong values, almost incomprehensible dialogue, and an atmosphere of ear splitting hysteria.That's when I turned it off and found another movie.Maybe it got better, but I doubt it.",Central Intelligence

162,ronnietg,Central Intelligence,2,25 July 2016,"I was highly disappointed by an absolutely awful script for this concept. For the genre of comedy, action there was the addition of dramatic elements of the Hero's character. This was actually a sub-genre of comedy: The buddy picture. Both characters had back stories to their high school days. There's the irony of the overachiever ""little guy"" and the buffoonery and cruelty toward the ""fat guy."" Then we have the ""most likely to succeed"" wallowing in his career as opposed to the ""fat guy"" who worked out 6 hours/day for 20 years and now is a superman in strength and who now is a CIA operative with superhuman combat skills. But how the above was related to the audience is where this script really fell down. The opening 10 minutes was pure talk. No action, just talk, talk, talk in one location. And then we have the incident we've been waiting for: the meeting of the two buddies. Then for the next 10 minutes, we have more talk, talk, talk at a bar...one location. So for 20 minutes, it's slow moving and going nowhere. In the action genre the audience comes prepared to see action. There is none. In the last 10 minutes of Act 1, we finally get a reveal as to the covert work that Dwayne has been doing these past 20 years, but it's more talk, talk, talk. Then we have the C.I.A. breaking in and we have the spoof of the Bourne series. Okay. I love the acting of the two buddies, but the script was so predictable, and yet so abysmally boring with talk, talk, talk, the audience was shifting in their seats from sheer frustration.

165,me-998-978033,"Great Action, Good Chemistry, Weird Storytelling",6,26 July 2016,"This movie had quite a bit going for it, Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, they're known for decent films, but this movie had too many cons, but let's start with the good side:1. The action scenes were a good balance between funny, action packed & borderline ridiculous, Hart's lines during the action sequences made up for some of the ridiculousness. 2. Johnson's & Hart's chemistry is good, it's not amazing, it's just good. They bounced off each other, they're lines, some of which were improv, didn't totally fall flat, but some did.The Cons: 1. The writers were trying too hard to make the viewers expect something, but throw us completely off guard it makes either, no sense, or makes the characters seem too dumb. 2. A lot of the references to pop culture fell flat & were too outdated. Everything from old online videos that weren't incredible back then & now are just obscure to reference now. 3. Johnson's character is just too weird, if you've seen the trailer, that's basically who the character is, he's too dumb & weird, it could almost be insulting to some people. 4. The Trailer Showed The Whole Film! They tried to make it so it's not the obvious answer, but it's the trailer & I quickly got bored of it.But my biggest problem with Central Intelligence is: The Bloopers Are The Best Part! During the credits, they show bloopers from the film & they were genuinely funnier than the rest.You'll enjoy it if you're a 15 year old boy, but it's more of a last resort to waste time.",Central Intelligence
166,CanadianAdam,"Creative, fun and doesn't overstay it's welcome",7,6 November 2016,"I'm hit or miss with Kevin Hart films. I liked this one. He was a similar character to what you're used to seeing from him but its a little more... ""mature"" in like a depressing adult, toned down way. But he's still funny and dials it up and down as the film goes.The Rock isn't just the big macho guy either. He's a bit quirky and weird and its a nice change of pace from mountain man action man you're used to. His comedic timing is better than I expected. Plus he wears a fanny pack.The movie follows some tropes you expect and then swerves at others so it doesn't feel too predictable. Sometimes it swerves and then swerves back so you still end up where you thought you were going but you get there a bit differently than the generic way you'd expect.There is a fun level of cheese to it as well. The movie never takes itself too seriously.It isn't a long movie which is great. Each scene just moves at the right speed and you're never bored or waiting too long for a gag.A lot of the minor characters have great scenes and moments which helps keep things fresh.If you got 90 minutes for a comedy and a bowl of snacks I'd recommend it.Full review: http://wp.me/p3Ww9J-lF :)",Central Intelligence

168,jibranahmad,Superb with Slight Fix,8,12 March 2017,"The movie is certainly a classic family fun in my book. I think the movie was put together very well and carried out well too. The only issue that it had was Kevin Heart. I do not think he was a perfect for the movie. He fit in well with the character in certain areas and expectations for what he filled, but he is not a seasoned actor. His stand-up comedy seemed to mix in with his lines. Whether the lines were intentionally written or not, it was a huge draw back. For the character I would have preferred to have Will Farrell, or Chris Tucker. I think for similar pitch without the drops, both actors would have picked up very well. I have to note that Dwayne Johnson played superb in the movie. His character is very hard to fill, not sure if it was intentional or not, the character came out as a genius, mixed with ignorance or clueless appearance. This made the movie much more of a comedy than a thriller. His character definitely fit well. The Rock is definitely one of the marvels in Hollywood.",Central Intelligence
169,deathhawk,This was fun.,7,23 September 2016,"The golden jet & bob stone make a great buddy comedy. Lots of laughs, and it didn't have that lull in the third act that most movies of this sort have. Quiet a few cameos, each of them were well placed and gave me a smile. Lots of easter eggs, and references to the 90's so pretty cool if you can associate with that also, but it's not necessary in order to enjoy the movie. A few dick and fart type jokes, but the core of the film was just well written comedy. I could definitely see there being a sequel, especially with the rock and kevin hart doing so many movies these days. It was also a feel good movie, and not just crow-barred into the movie to falsify depth, it genuinely had a good message, and made me happy. So check it out and have some laughs.I give it a seven out of ten.",Central Intelligence
170,cybainfo,Funny in parts but lacking as a whole,3,5 July 2016,"Had some funny parts but fell apart in my opinion because of Dwayne's character. Fair enough he was a nerd in school but as he started buffing up and getting all the ladies he would've gained confidence and not still been all nerdy as he matured. I don't think Kevin knew how to work with that ridiculous character and so it didn't really work as a whole. Someone else nailed it here when they said it lacks depth. The characters are trying too hard to be funny and super buddy and just don't gel. I would almost rather see Kev and the rock put in a real life situation, reality TV style, where their own jokes would be much funnier! Just my point of view.",Central Intelligence
171,pablospersonal,Gold Dynamite with Marshmallows,9,7 September 2016,"I want to be The Rock. It is never gonna happen because I am the same size as one of his legs. I love watching the man though, my wife calls it a man crush - what does she know. Kevin Hart is one of those guys I can take or leave. He has always been entertaining but sometimes I am just not in the mood for his energetic style. Armed with my serious head, some walnuts (apparently we are eating healthy because it is a Rock film) and some carefully stored scepticism, I was ready to participate in this film. I had read many reviews, in fact I had read so many that this movie was all I could talk about. I couldn't find a bad review - this worried me - although as I found out I shouldn't have been worried. This movie is rare gold, almost priceless and will no doubt have more middle aged, slightly portly men hitting the gym and trying to recreate humorous childhood one liners with their workmates, after seeing this. The buddy movie is a genre of film that can be hard to crack. Gibson and Glover were the kings but we may have just accepted a new royal bloodline to take that throne. Central Intelligence is a fun filled, comedic onslaught. It marries the natural relationship - that is plainly obvious - between the Rock and Kevin Hart. The performances are effortless. The performances are also great, Kevin Hart entertained me the whole way through this film without me feeling the urge to wee. The script had been carefully moulded to suit these two heavy weights and I dare say there were many opportunities for ad libbing. They made the viewing time pass like a dream. The plot was weak, but to be perfectly frank you don't care. You really don't - it doesn't feel like that moment when you nip to the shops for a new iron and come home with a kettle, get annoyed and decide to make your kids eat tomatoes for a week because you bought the wrong thing. It genuinely doesn't matter. The story could have easily been turned into Steven Seagal's next three movies, all be it with three different working titles and without the intentional comedy - but honestly you don't care. The plot is enough to get you through. It is the characters and the fast wit and humour of both The Rock and Hart that keep you seated. I honestly thought I had torn muscles in my face, I laughed so hard. There is nothing really to tell you other than see it. It is not going to leave you full with Oscar tainted performances. It won't satisfy those who prefer to watch documentaries about the Brazillian Bot Fly, neither will everyone appreciate the humour. But, if you like to let your hair down, watch something mindless, entertaining with some feverish and close humour. This is your film! Even my mate enjoyed it and he has DVD's on how to decorate canal boats. It gets a 9 because the plot is not great and I want a sequel!",Central Intelligence

173,sie_francis82,Lacks Intelligence,4,4 July 2016,"One of the most appealing things about Kevin Hart has to be his marketing team. That's not to say he isn't a great comedian; his stand up is currently second to none. Yet, for his new movie, Central Intelligence, he has taken to Facebook and Twitter with his co-star Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson and presented some outright hilarious and completely irrelevant videos, such as; Hart and Johnson conducting a one-on-one interview while doing an impression of each other. It's ludicrous but their belly laughing is very contagious. It only seems a disappointment how they don't quite manage to portray the same on screen chemistry for the movie.Hart plays Calvin Joyner, an accountant and one time high school golden boy who regrets that he never lived up to his potential. He also happened to be the only kid in school who showed any compassion toward heavily overweight, nerd Robbie Weirdicht, played by an impressively CG rendered Johnson. Twenty years on and Robbie returns to reconnect with Calvin through Facebook with a new name and a mountainous physique. What Calvin didn't account for was that behind Bob's overzealous persona lies the cunning mind of a super spy as he is dragged into a dangerous game of espionage with the CIA.One thing is for sure, Johnson does not have any natural comedic ability and this movie is certainly evident of that. Give the guy a gun and a cheesy one-liner and he's immediately likable but here, his attempts appear forced and down right awkward to watch. However, his performance reflects the considerably under-cooked script in which a lot of the material relies on the improv talents of their key actors and, to overcompensate, Hart gives it everything he's got while ultimately reducing his part to a series of shrill attacks on his bumbling costar. Think Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan in Rush Hour. Although, in that respect, Johnson isn't even given the decency of any respectable choreography to show off his more applicable talents. For a movie primarily focused on the relationship between this oddball, buddy-up, action comedy, any actual plot becomes insignificant; something about account numbers and selling secrets, basic CIA stuff. Although, it's a shame as the two actors are individually very capable of being entertaining in the right roles. This little and large team-up had a lot of potential but the whole thing just comes across as hopelessly underdeveloped. In saying that, the tag-line is nothing short of genius, 'Saving the world takes a little HART and a big JOHNSON'. Shame I can't say the same for the movie.For more news, reviews and trailers visit whatsiesays-online.com",Central Intelligence

In an era when comedies have slipped into inane stupidity floundering, falling way below any Animal House level or Spaceball spoof, Central Intelligence has broken the mold with Fantastic Comedy, Pure Adrenaline and Kick-the-Bully-Heart!This movie is inventive, has fabulous misdirection and engaging special effects and the chemistry between the male leads simply is a joy to watch. In a head-to-head with Ghostbusters, Central Intelligence actually won - thankfully Melissa was in both, but her cameo in Central Intelligence was just off the charts adorable and had the audience rolling in the aisle! Trust me. Go see this movie and you will love it.

The plot is focused around Calvin, an accountant who was very successful now a failure and Bob (formally Robert) who was a failure in high school now ex-member of the CIA. Bob eventually gets Calvin to help him find encryption codes that have been stolen. The plot to this movie, well, was not memorable. Why did I give it 10 stars then? I was not expecting a good plot. I was expecting comedy and fun and action, although not too much as that would ruin the comedic atmosphere and this movie performed. Kevin Hart's performance was outstanding in this film and I would definitely be interested in watching more of the work he is in.

Definitely not one of the enjoyable ones from The Rock's catalog.My biggest problem with this movie was Kevin Hart, I haven't watched many of his movies since when i have seen his work, it's always that hyperactive, screaming and self-repeating guy. It worked in Die Hard 3 when Zeus told John Mcclane that he wants's nothing to do with this plan (and them slurring insults to each other, it was funny,) but here, Kevin Hart seems to be repeating that line all the time when the action starts.
It grows old really quick, and then he becomes that annoying sidekick that won't shut up.After about halfway of the movie, he starts working together with The Rock, and the movie turns into a mediocre buddy cop-movie. Not much action to remember it by, some jokes are good, some not. Just overall a neutral experience.

(yes i know they probably used wires and camera magic, but still makes me wonder is that kind of kick even possible?)The Rock was really cool in this one, and saw a great friendship grow throughout the whole movie. And it all ended with a big bang! Showing the girl I have a huge crush on crushing on Melissa McCartney LOVE HER!!! Shes hilarious. I can't get enough of this movie!

I rented it from Google Play videos ($4.99) to watch with my wife because it has the Rock in it. Overall it was enjoyable to watch while we watched it. The Rock is fun to watch in goofy comedies, he is very good at that role. Kevin Hart plays a very Kevin Hart role, and that was fun. There is a mystery that runs through the movie that kept me focused on the movie.However, the ending was mediocre. and afterwards looking back it just feels shallow. There is a lot of easy humor, but few standout jokes. the characters who are not the Rock or Kevin Hart are weak. Overall the movie is forgettable.Recommendation: If you are looking for a funny movie to watch, there are many better buddy spy movies. I would not go out of my way to watch it again.

It was like they had a lot of funny jokes or situations in the script, but at the last minute the censors made them take out the punchlines. I did like the story, and there was even a bit of ""who dunnit"" suspense. The fact that they had a decent structure and great talent leaves me thinking that the writers were more interested in drama and action than comedy - but the movie was promoted as a comedy, and has several events and props that scream ""COMEDY MOVIE.""

Spoilers: the movie wanted to do a twist in Johnson's character by having him portray to be good and bad which really makes it weird how near the end, Johnson gave a smirk after turning away from Hart as he enters the underground parking. Bateman's character, Trevor, felt weird and out of place as an adult.

Kevin Hart was his funny old self as usual, couldn't fault him, but the poor plot couldn't even help him stand out. The poster and trailer looked like it would be one of the funniest, and best, movies of the year, but it really wasn't.To explain the 4 stars - it wasn't the worst movie in the world, but for its big names and huge hype, it didn't deliver.

Another annoying film where a main character (Kevin Hart's) arrested then acts and starts babbling in ways that no living person ever would while the arresting CIA agents hang around in the scene inertly (and no, his act is not in the slightest way funny.) Likewise its hard to get any handle on Dwayne Johnson's character - he's made good from being the bullied fat kid at the opening but a confusing trajectory which led him to be a CIA agent, but is he good or rogue?

And even with all that ""not so great"" acting, it is a funny movie.My best scene: CIA agents have Calvin (Hart) and Bob (Johnson) surrounded on every side. Calvin is inside a trolley which Bod holds. Calvin is terrified with his hands up. The CIA agents call them to put their hands in the air. Bob raises his hands and BOOM, out of nowhere his gun hits Calvin in the forehead. It's not a masterpiece, but a funny film!",Central Intelligence

Seriously. As a result, the whole production panders to it. Cheap and repetitive.

206,thehamster1,The most overacted rubbish,2,5 July 2016,"Avoid this movie ! This weak story line is not helped in the slightest by Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson poor attempt to act. Even though Kevin Hart is a respected stand up, there was no funny moment in this movie that was not shown in the trailer. Save yourself some money and time by just having a cheap laugh at the trailer as this contains the few decent parts of the movie. The predictable story line of the popular high school jock (Kevin Hart) in the future becoming a bit of a loser stuck in a dead end job. While a school nerd becoming some cool FBI agent (Dwayne Johnson) is such a lazy plot and there is no real development on the story line other than this. Not to mention the fact that Dawyne Johnsons attempt to play a different sort of character than the typical hard man just comes across strange and unbelievable and is one of the worst examples of acting i have ever seen in my life.",Central Intelligence
207,ivan-yergiyev,It takes two to make a good comedy - little Hart and big Johnson,7,22 July 2016,"When I heard that Central Intelligence is going to star Dwyane Johnson and Kevin Hart – I was absolutely sure about watching it in theaters. First trailer confirmed my assumptions – it looked pretty legit to me.The plot has nothing special in it from the beginning: classic ""before"" scene from 1996, which introduces us to Calvin Joyner (Kevin Hart) and Bob Stone (Dwyane Johnson). Calvin was a typical guy everyone would love to be friends with and Bob was just someone you wanted to bully all the time. Quick jump to 2016 shows us that Kevin wasted his ""potential"". However, we see tremendous transformation of Dwyane Johnson's character. He is the Rock now. Wait, is it actually possible to bully the Rock, even in 1996? Anyways, since that we can enjoy great chemistry between Kevin and Bob.Many people might think: ""Oh, another spy movie. I am so tired of it"". I am going to tell you one thing – this movie is nothing about spying at all. Well, it is in some way – FBI agents, terrorists and all that. But it is not the main ""selling"" point of the movie. Thriller and spy part seems pretty straightforward and ""easy to predict"". But the way it goes to this obvious end is the key. Sweet high-school buddies friendship, bullies jokes and hilarious action scenes – all this is Central Intelligence. What actually amazed me is the fact that even though this film is all about laughing, it kept me smiled during all 105 minutes. Isn't it amazing when a big muscle machine Dwyane Johnson delivers one of the best jokes you would ever hear? Or little Hart doing cool ass moves you have never expected from him. Beyond all that, I was really surprised when I saw Aaron Paul in this movie. While he was more like a cameo, his character still got a few ""breaking bad"" quotes, if you know what I mean.Overall, film is centralized on delightful chemistry of two main actors. Usually, it is not enough to keep people entertained. In this case, it is. Another perfect evidence is domestic gross which is more than 120 million dollars. Not bad for a comedy movie, huh? However, this film is not gonna ""suit"" every viewer. A lot of people aren't going to get jokes, characters motivations and references. But all in all, if you are a guy who does not judge movies too strictly – Central Intelligence is a perfect choice for you. Strong 7/10 for me. Hopefully, I will see Dwyane Johnson in comedies again – he is really great.",Central Intelligence
208,ddmagic38,"Enjoyable thanks in large part to Hart & ""The Rock""",7,5 July 2016,"Central Intelligence succeeds because the chemistry between Kevin Hart & Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is so engaging that the film really becomes the ultimate bromance movie. The chemistry between them is so strong that it almost carries the entire film but ultimately falls short due to a weak third act.Dwayne Johnson portrays a lovable, goofy, yet straight arrow CIA agent. He is impressive as a comedian, he provides plenty of charm and is surprising vulnerable. Kevin Hart is pleasantly restrained but still comes off very likable. He is a great straight man which is a real treat compared to what I usually see him in. Bravo to both men for playing against type.The films biggest flaw is in its third act. The story of these two men who haven't seen each other since high school and becoming reacquainted to attend a high school reunion really should have been the heart of the story with the Johnson's involvement with the CIA kept only as a subplot. As it is, the films third act devolves into a standard, paint by numbers action flick and almost grinds the film to a halt.As it is Central Intelligence is a fun afternoon popcorn flick.",Central Intelligence

its a bit different. The film wants to go in two directions or would like to combine them: Action and Comedy, but it cant decide in which direction it will go. Sometimes there are only comedic scenes. But suddenly it tries to look like a serious action movie wich doesnt make sense and doesnt feel right. The Plot is not worth talking about and is just stupid. The acting is also quite bad. The rock isnt very talented and kevin hart likes to overact all the time. The Characters are just so bizarre, especially the rock and his past.

220,phoebe-brooks,The 3 minutes of bloopers were funnier than the entire film! But not bad.,6,11 July 2016,"The film begins with a close up of the obese rear end of the usually Herculean Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson. As it does a significant pan out shot, it shows him in the shower singing to En Vogue's My Lovin (You're Never Gonna Get It) and jiggling to every beat of the music. Cut to bullies making fun, and throwing him out in front of the entire student body at an assembly to celebrate the many achievements of Kevin Harts character Calvin Joyner aka The Golden Jet.The scene is definitely lacklustre. In part, because of the slightly off graphic of the CGI face/bodies of the actors and their younger counterparts. But also because the scene was the films main teaser trailer and therefore been shown on television for weeks in the lead up and viewed countless times. And perhaps also because simply relying on humour because there's a fat person on screen being bullied isn't exactly everyone's taste.We follow the life of Calvin Joyner, the guy who peaks in high school and his life falls downhill from then. Even though he is married to his high school sweet heart Maggie (Danielle Nicolet), he can't shake the feeling of failure. Not being help that his assistant is promoted before him in the accountancy firm he works at, and he hates his co-workers. In order to shake things up, he lets his old classmate lead him down a dangerous path which involves shoot outs, CIA rats and saving the world, all thanks to his mean skills as an accountant.The film follows a lacklustre theme throughout, a lot of the jokes seem to fall flat. Especially when there repeated throughout expecting the same reaction, and the twist ending was guessed in the first half of the film (you don't hire an actor that popular and only use him for a 2 minute scene). Jokes are pretty simple, Robbie Weirdicht wears a fanny pack and that's apparently hilarious. He acts like a lost puppy for a lot of the film, desperate to befriend with the coolest kid in school.Essentially the big joke is how dorky Robbie is, whilst being in peak physical condition, and how cool Calvin is, despite being the little man. But I think it's the failings in the characters which completely let down this film. Dorky Robbie is completely unbelievable as a CIA agent and what he gets away with in the film is a joke, not the funny kind. You'll be questioning why Calvin doesn't just press the button in the therapist's office for the rest of the film! And as for Kevin Hart's performance of Calvin Joyner? Pretty much the exact same character and performance in other one of his films. Short 'every- man' and kind-hearted to a fault. Loud, quick speaking gibberish when stressed, all with a beautiful wife and some kind of special skill to make him needed for the story. It just doesn't feel like the film was thought out and put together in a concise enough way. The entire film relies on the fact that Robbie is a bit pathetic still because he was bullied and Calvin is a good enough guy to keep helping him.If Robbie made it through the CIA then surely he's built a pretty thick skin along with those muscles. As for Calvin, when a guy you weren't ever friends with asks you to join his illegal and potentially fatal mission. You say no! The premise of the film really requires a suspension of belief from the audience to accept what their seeing, otherwise there's a lot to question.In conclusion the film is a pleasant one, I didn't find myself wanting to get up and leave the Cineworld cinema. It did make me smile on occasion and it might have made me laugh a few times but definitely not the best comedy I've ever seen. Even by Kevin Hart's standards. But if your looking for a silly comedy where you don't have to think too much and you like a bit of slapstick then this is probably your calling!",Central Intelligence

Most movies nowadays throw in drugs, sex and parties which pretty much sums up most of the comedic movies that have hit the big screen in 2016. I wasn't expecting much out of this movie, but I knew that I had a decent chance to get a laugh.Both Kevin Hart and Dwayne Johnson delivered with a chemistry which could only be described as bromance; a bromance which rivals Jackie Chan and Chris Tucker in rush hour 1, and 2. Now don't get me wrong here, I am not saying it was a better bromance than we witnessed in those movies, but it definitely gives those two a run for their money.Grab the popcorn, hang on tight, and enjoy the movie like you were about to watch Jackie Chan in rush hour.",Central Intelligence

But this one is a bit different! Without spoiling to much, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson brings a lot to this, and is already known as Dwayne ""The Franchise Viagra"" Johnson, so this is going to be big! The bromance between the characters is much more believable than Harts movies with Ice Cube, Josh Gad or Will Ferrell.

So refreshing to see Kevin Hart in a more serious role, instead of forcing comedy as many of his movies such as Get Hard become. The real star here though is The Rock who really gets to show off his comedic chops with his goofy and lovable character. The other great thing is that the trailer did not give away the other cast members of the film. The story is also rewarding as there is solid character development, all of which is can be familiar to many. Something that in a summer action blockbuster is usually non-existent.

225,fantasyromeo,"Best part is Dwayne Johnson, weakest part is Kevin Hart",8,20 June 2016,"The movie is better than others are giving it credit for, and I am largely unsure why. The plot is solid and keeps you guessing, the acting is for the most part perfect. The jokes are on point, the pacing is good, and you are able to laugh then rest and then get excited over a well down action scene rest and then repeat the process. It is hard to find a movie that lets you get a moment to catch your breath and reset your emotions a little. The Rock is amazing in his role of someone so friendly and caring, yet also so out of touch with reality. He has good chemistry on screen with Kevin, and the scenes of him just basically ignoring everything Kevin has to say or think in order for him to get him to come along are done very well. Where the movie has trouble is the scenes with Kevin Hart trying to be Kevin Hart. When he is in a scene without Dwayne, and is trying to be funny it falls flat. His over the top style doesn't work when someone is being better at it, which Dwayne does in almost every scene. Kevin actually does some good acting when he is serious and not trying to force laughter on the audience. Also the movie is paced at such perfection that you don't even notice that 2 hours have flown by, and that is important. A 2 hour film is a long sit, and when you are thinking about the time and not the movie that tells you that a movie hasn't got you invested in it, but Central Intelligence does a good job of keeping you invested.

The Rock is a really funny actor but this movie just didn't let him do that, and it was almost unbearable to watch his talent go to waste. Kevin Hart was great but I've just seen better characters from both of them. Just unfortunate. The reality that his character didn't evolve as much but just became better looking may just be the point that sometimes that happens, and that that's okay is fine by me.

232,ivanleo,Central Intelligence Reviews,7,19 June 2016,"I recently managed to catch Central intelligence in cinemas and it has truly not failed to live up to my expectations, even surpassing it at some point. I had been looking forward to this movie for quite some time, having been closely monitoring it's progress through The Rock's Instagram account which I followed. He promised a fun packed movie for the summer and he delivered.What I didn't like so much about this movie was the fact that Dwayne Johnson's past as a fat teenage boy was made fun of so much, though I did get a good laugh about it, it could have been handled better. The movie does attempt to remedy this by including a scene in the end where Johnson punches his old tormentor in the face saying that he doesn't like bullies. This hardly seems sufficient but at least an attempt was made.Nonetheless, this is not an Action Movie for those who are planning to watch it, this is a Comedy Movie. Understandably this is due to the director, Rawson Marshall Thurber, whose portfolio includes Dodgeball and the comedic hit We're The Millers and this is a choice well made. After all, what makes this movie good isn't the plot, which at times comes across as hollow and facile, but the chemistry between the two male leads. The two have signed up to do more movies together such as the recently announced Jumaji reboot and it is completely understandable why.The chemistry between the two male leads, Dwayne Johnson and Kevin Hart is undeniable with each given ample time to shine in their character roles, Johnson as the cunning and capable CIA operative and Hart as the timid and tepid accountant. As the story line progresses, one sees this chemistry truly shines, this is something that saves Central Intelligence from being just another mainstream action movie and turns it into the summer hit that I predict it will be.In Conclusion, If you're looking for a great movie that'll leave your jaws hurting from laughing too much and aren't really particular about the quality of the script, you'll love this movie. It'll give you a good laugh and wanting for more. Now that I've seen what Kevin Hart and The Rock can do together, I can't wait to see more of their future collaborations.It gets 4 stars for the comedy, though that gets knocked down to 3.5 due to the weak plot that tries to tie the story together.If you liked this review, visit my blog at www.leoreview.wordpress.com!

Nasty sexual references and fowl language. So unnecessary. I was surprised that Dewayn Johnson would have his name on anything this bad. And I don't see how it received a PG13 rating when it should have been rated R. Let me put it this way. This was the first movie I ever walked out on before it ended. For anyone with kids I would suggest picking another movie. I made the mistake of taking my 12 and 13 year old.

It's certainly a role reversal with The Rock bringing most of the witty comedy and Hart being the more serious of the two characters. Nonetheless there's a good screen chemistry between these two that doesn't appear in similar Kevin Hart films. This isn't just a roll your eye and laugh at the stupidity type of film.

238,buffalobisonj,Review of Central Intelligence,8,18 July 2016,"Going in to Central Intelligence I didn't know what to think. With many comedic movies, I didn't want to build it up too much in my mind, cause that is a sure fire way to not enjoy the movie. I was pleasantly surprised by the picture though. Hart and Johnson almost switched roles in a sense, with Johnson taking on a quirkier role and Hart playing the part of the level headed thinker. They both were able to take a new role and add it to the same gut busting comedy we love from them, and made a movie that was truly delightful to watch. Several times I laughed till my stomach hurt. The other thing that made this film more enjoyable was the plot line. In most movies, as the story progresses you start to make assumptions on what is going to happen, or who the bad guy is. With Central Intelligence, I was wrong in my assumptions, and when I found out I was wrong, it made the movie much more enjoyable in a sense. It made me go back and rethink what had happened, and I could see where I was wrong in my thinking. All in all it was a great film that I will watch again.",Central Intelligence
239,DarkestLady,Very funny and unexpected,10,23 August 2016,"I wasn't expecting that this movie will be so enjoyable. It was funny and with unexpected moments, that made me surprise, for example, Dwayne Johnson - really funny and so into role so as Kevin Hart. Movie could make interest even in people who don't like shooting movies, just like me. Movie creators did something amazing - they made unusual role for Dwayne Johnson. He was not like in other movies ""serious cop"" but botanist - this is what I thought at the beginning and I was really into it. And at that moment I didn't understand why this movie was called Central Intelligence, of course I understood it it the end. I would suggest to watch this movie for everyone.",Central Intelligence
240,maddytamaki,"Pretty good, little disappointed.",6,12 August 2016,"This movie was fairly entertaining production that is action packed with a few laughs. Though I was quite let down as both of the main actors can be quite humorous in their own way, and this was not necessarily the case. Don't get me wrong there were a few laughs but not as many as you would expect. The movie started pretty well but towards the end it got a bit hard to keep up with, confusing and just disappointing. I thought the lines were fairly well written. This movie is more for people of younger ages, as the movie is more 'goofy' than funny. The character that the Johnson plays is not like his usual characters as he plays Robbie who is seemingly childish, but Dwayne seems to pull it off with a few sloppy scenes here and there. Overall this movie was fairly good but a bit of a disappointment with comedy and did not lack in action packed scenes.",Central Intelligence
241,maltamassage,Amazing,10,27 October 2016,"i love this movie, i love the puns, jokes, and even the anti-climatic things, its a great movie and has cool action packed scenes to keep you on the edge of your seat! i personally recommend this to you and anyone else (13 or above) i don't know if anyone got any Oscars for this but they should for great acting! There is so much drama, mystery, theoretical thoughts going through you mind during this movie, it truly brings a bang to your imagination, and not to mention the hilarious failures in the movie, outstanding! id love to spoil the rest of the movie, but that is not *IMDb* material stuff, so ill let ya spoil yourself Enjoy!",Central Intelligence
242,lovelifenow-40839,Great movie!!,7,31 January 2017,"I gave it an 7 only because of the office scene where Agent Stone is 'attacking' the agents' butts in the office scene....only to find out what the ending was which discredits this whole scene. Also, in the scene where Agent Stone spends the night at Hart's place, the wife is nowhere to be found that night or the next morning. she should've been home right? Even if she was still sleeping or in the shower, she would have known when all the agents came swarming into and searching the house.But, overall, it was full of twists and hilarious!I really enjoyed this one. Roles were well done and the movie had an AWESOME, encouraging message for everyone to take to heart!",Central Intelligence
243,carriganchance,Didn't meet expectations and only doing this for my theater class,4,21 February 2017,"This movie did not really meet my expectations. The beginning of the movie was pretty good but then after the build up it really just got dull and boring and the ending was not all that great either. I mean with the caliber of fire power you have with the actors that movie should had been funny throughout but it really got annoying with Robbie Weird Dick(Dwayne 'The Rock"" Johnson) trying to be too funny by acting a little weird.",Central Intelligence
244,mikawoz-36205,The Rock,8,18 March 2017,"Dwayne Johnson plays the part of an overweight fat high-schooler who is embarrassed in front of the entire school. A number of pranksters get him in front of the audience completely naked. He is saved by the all-athlete all-academic Golden Jet. Fast-forward 20 years into the future and the top athlete/academic student is an accountant when the Rock comes into Kevin Hart's life. There is a mix-up of operatives in the CIA and the case of international monies. The situation is bizarre. Kevin Hart's character has to choose who he believes – the Rock or the CIA. It is a good, funny movie.",Central Intelligence
245,siddak_chadha,"Great action, Great comedy, and Great chemistry!! must watch",9,8 March 2018,"This is the type of movie that delivers what it promises. If you take your logical and serious brain with you, you are to be disappointed. I went to watch an out and out entertainer and I got one. There are all kinds of funny moments in this movie, the outrageous action comedy, subtle funny one liners, stupid stunts and what not",Central Intelligence
