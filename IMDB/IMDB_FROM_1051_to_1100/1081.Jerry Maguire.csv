0,TheLittleSongbird,"""Show me the money!""",8,7 September 2010,"Jerry Maguire may be rather overlong and a little pedestrian in places, but overall it is a very interesting and somewhat unusual film. The concept really intrigued me and one of the main reasons why I saw Jerry Maguire in the first place, and this concept worked really well thanks to the well written story and the witty and poignant script. Jerry Maguire is also beautifully filmed with lovely cinematography and scenery, and the soundtrack is warm and infectious. Cameron Crowe's direction is very good, as are the relationships between the characters. Jerry Maguire also benefits from some superb performances. Tom Cruise gives one of his best performances here, and he is perfectly matched by Renee Zellwegger at her most beautiful and the adorable Jonathan Lipnicki. Though the real star is Cuba Gooding Jnr who is absolutely marvellous as Jerry's sole remaining client. To conclude, a very good film, well worth watching for the performances and concept alone. 8/10 Bethany Cox",Jerry Maguire
1,bkoganbing,"""You Complete Me""",9,24 November 2007,"If Jerry Maguire were made 30 years earlier I can see Jack Lemmon playing the title role. You wouldn't think of Tom Cruise being up for parts that Jack Lemmon would have been cast for, but he does an incredible job in the role of go-getter sports agent Maguire who decides to leave the high pressure agency that Jay Mohr runs and going out on his own.Cruise has one of those chew the scenery moments when he leaves Mohr's office and secretary Renee Zellweger decides to leave with him. She's been crushing out on him for the longest time even though he's been seeing Kelly Preston. But patience can certainly be its own reward sometime.If Jerry Maguire lacks something it would probably be Billy Wilder's surefire wit and sense of satire. Jerry Maguire would have been a great film for him to write and direct. Satire however might have crowded out romance in a Wilder film.And it's romance that the movie going public likes with Tom Cruise. Some of his and Renee Zellweger's best scenes are with little Jonathan Lipnicki who is her son from a previous marriage. The kid is a scene stealer, mainly because he acts like a real kid, not some Hollywood creation.Cruise has some tough sledding at first, one client he had counted on was college sensation Jerry O'Connell who is being inundated with draft offers and endorsements. O'Connell and his family, despite the whole honest country boy shtick, do disappoint him.His one client who does stick with him is Cuba Gooding Jr. who plays Rod Tidwell, a running back for the Phoenix Suns. Tidwell's one egotistical handful and Gooding won a deserved Best Supporting Actor Oscar. However the reason he won it is that his portrayal of Tidwell is multidimensional. His scenes with wife Regina King and the rest of his family are far removed from the Muhammed Ali like face he shows the public.Cruise also was nominated for Best Actor in the title role. But he lost to Geoffrey Rush for Shine. In fact Jerry Maguire lost for Best Picture to The English Patient. I was pulling for Tom that year myself.Though I think a lot of Billy Wilder type satire was missed, Jerry Maguire is still a very well done film. Maybe it needed a Billy Wilder to direct it.",Jerry Maguire
2,Leofwine_draca,Artificial,4,16 September 2021,This was another one I absolutely hated seeing at the cinema. A lame romantic comedy dressed up as something else. Cruise is at his slimiest and as for Zellweger - no thanks! The sports backdrop was of no interest to me whatsoever and I felt like I saw straight through the artificiality of this one.,Jerry Maguire
3,SnoopyStyle,Cameron Crowe does it again,7,9 November 2013,"Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a top sports agent. Only lately, he's noticing something morally wrong in his world. In the dead of night, he types up his 'mission statement' punctuated by 'Fewer clients. Less money.' He distributes it to his officemates, and it eventually blows up in his face. (Love the synchronicity of the old Mission Impossible footage) It has great iconic lines and breakout performances from Renée Zellweger and Cuba Gooding Jr. Tom Cruise is perfect for the self involved agent who comes to a life changing reckoning. Cameron Crowe delivers the lines and the actors deliver the performances. It's a great under-the-radar rom-com. Only it's more a rom-com between Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr. than Tom Cruise and Renée Zellweger.",Jerry Maguire
4,Hitchcoc,Soul Reclamation,7,29 December 2016,"As upset as I get with him, I can't help but like Tom Cruise. He does a nice job as the irrepressible Jerry Maguire, a sports agent making it big, but feeling empty about it. He works for people he doesn't respect. He analyses where he is at and decides to fend for himself. He will start a new firm by getting a couple top names to go with him. It's not easy and soon he is without a job and without a single client. The only one who goes with him is young Renee Zelwigger. Cruise's fiancée and just about everyone else (even those for him he made big money) bales on him. What is left is a twofold plot. One is his hopes of signing a can't lose prospect played by Cuba Gooding, Jr. The other is starting his life over with a person who really loves him. This is a quick, interesting look into the world of sports agents.",Jerry Maguire
5,Prismark10,You had me at hello,6,22 February 2017,"Jerry Maguire is a feel good romantic drama which surfed a zeitgeist wave in the mid 1990s and coined catchphrases such as 'Show me the money' 'You had me at hello' and 'You complete me.'Tom Cruise plays the successful sports agent Jerry Maguire who upsets his bosses with a mission statement such as having less clients in order to serve them better. His rival at the firm has to fire him and then compete for all his clients.Maguire is only left with one client, a mouthy, flamboyant football player Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding jr) who is upset that he is not getting the top endorsement deals. Maguire also is also chasing a hot shot player for the draft and thinks he has bagged him only to be snatched away by his rival.Maguire starts out at the bottom with Tidwell and Dorothy (Renee Zellweger) a single mother and one of the assistants from the sports agency who has followed him. Dorothy and Jerry fall in love but we are not sure if he genuinely confused her loyalty with love.Maguire needs to persuade Tidwell to play football with his heart and not think about endorsements or why other players are earning more. Tidwell shows loyalty and friendship to Maguire but in the football field he comes across as shallow and selfish. A reason why Maguire is struggling to get a lucrative contract deal for him.Jerry Maguire is actually a corny film, Cuba Gooding jr provides the laughs but the romance angle is very cheesy.At the end Maguire is successful because of the one to one relationship he has with his only client which other sports player are envious of.I saw this film again after 20 years because part of the scenes were featured in The Lego Batman Movie, the implication being some of the lines are hackneyed.",Jerry Maguire
6,classicsoncall,"""I'm starting a new company, and the fish will come with me.""",7,18 July 2018,"Unlike many films in which the central character has a career changing epiphany near the end of the story, this one occurs right at the start. Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a highly successful sports agent who ultimately comes to grips with the empty life style and endless quest for money that takes over one's life when they find themselves at the top of their profession. The movie handles Maguire's transition with considerable skill without overlooking the doubts and fears one would expect when making a life altering decision. For those who had faith in Jerry all along, Cuba Gooding Jr's Tidwell learns a lesson in humility when taken to task for playing with his head and not his heart, while Renee Zellweger's own heart wears consistently on her sleeve for Jerry's time and attention. Their eventual marriage is tested when it becomes a question of love versus loyalty, but once again, Jerry Maguire returns to a principled conclusion that his new family is worth more than all the mega-bucks available in the fast paced world of celebrity sports and multi-million dollar endorsements. Here's a movie with a different kind of 'show me the money' message and well worth your time.",Jerry Maguire
7,gavin6942,"Fun Film, Even With That Loser Tom Cruise",7,21 May 2015,"When a sports agent (Tom Cruise) has a moral epiphany and is fired for expressing it, he decides to put his new philosophy to the test as an independent with the only athlete (Cuba Gooding Junior) who stays with him.Can we all agree Tom Cruise is over-rated? He has made some great films, some real blockbusters. He brings in the money. And, shockingly, he has gotten two Oscar nominations (I think maybe even for this film). But seriously, he is not good. He just happens to be in good films... with rare exception (maybe ""Magnolia""?) when have you actually seen him act? This is a good film. Not a great one, but a good one. It was popular when it first came out because some people thought that kid was cute. Is he still around? Who knows.",Jerry Maguire
8,lee_eisenberg,You had me at Jerry...,8,30 December 2005,"Every person is probably bound to have to take a look at his/her life at some point or other. Movies often like to use this as a plot, but not all pull it off. ""Jerry Maguire"" manages to pull it off. As the sports writer title character, Tom Cruise makes the most of himself (something that he too often doesn't do). Fired from his job, he hooks up with single mom Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger), and goes through a further life-changing experience.It's hard to say who has the best role in this movie. Without a doubt, Cruise and Zellweger do very well in their roles - Zellweger was clearly showing the talent that she would later bring to ""Chicago"" and other movies. Cuba Gooding Jr. won Best Supporting Actor for his role as athlete Rod Tidwell. The imperfect but assertive Tidwell is a hard character to qualify, which is part of what makes him so interesting. Maybe ""Jerry Maguire"" wasn't the year's best movie, but I wholeheartedly recommend it. You'll never look at things the same way again.",Jerry Maguire
9,jboothmillard,Jerry Maguire,8,9 September 2005,"From director Cameron Crowe (Almost Famous), this is a funny, touching and charming sports comedy romance. Golden Globe winning, and Oscar nominated Tom Cruise plays Jerry Maguire, a sports agent who is ""at the top of his game"", and he is breaking down after being fired. The only person willing to go with him to make a new company is Dorothy Boyd (Bridget Jones's Renée Zellweger). When he loses his best client Frank Cushman (Jerry O'Connell) to his mean opposition Bob Sugar (Small Soldiers' Jay Mohr), the one and only client he can try and make a career for, and from, is ego-maniacal football player Rod Tidwell (Oscar winning, and Golden Globe nominated Cuba Gooding Jr.). Jerry is doing everything he can (for free) to try and resurrect Rod's career and get him the recognition he knows he and his wife Marcee (Regina King) want. Also on Jerry's mind is his close relationship with Dorothy and her lovable son Raymond (Stuart Little's Jonathan Lipnicki), turning into real love and eventually a marriage, that does fall apart for a little while, but in the end is saved by Jerry's words. Also starring Kelly Preston as Avery Bishop (Jerry's ex-fiancée), Jumanji's Bonnie Hunt as Laurel (Dorothy's sister). The scene where Cruise and Gooding Jr. are shouting the famous catchphrase on the phone is pure entertainment. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Film Editing, Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen and Best Picture, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy/Musical. Tom Cruise was number 32 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was number 25 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, the film was number 56 on The 100 Greatest Tearjerkers for Jerry coming back, it was number 100 on 100 Years, 100 Passions, and it was number 52 (""You had me at ""hello""."") and number 25 (""Show me the money!"") on 100 Years, 100 Quotes. Very good!",Jerry Maguire
10,ccthemovieman-1,The Good & Bad Of 'Jerry Maguire',7,10 July 2006,"Every time I see a football player act like he's been mortally wounded, and then gets up and continues playing just fine, I think of this movie. Cuba Gooding plays just such a character but Tom Cruise is the star of this movie which did pretty well at the box office. You wouldn't think a film about a sports agent would be this successful.THE GOOD - Generally nice people that you want to root for, especially the kid, ""Ray Boyd,"" played by Jonathan Lipnicki, That was this child's first film and he went on to further fame in the Stuart Little movies and now on television. Cuba Gooding was funny in an exaggerated role of the greedy and show-boating football player. Cruise and Rene Zellweger are big names in the business who usually deliver good performances.THE BAD - Nineties morality (sex right off the bat, and a few other attitudes) and overuse of the f-word. There's not an excessive amount, but way too many f- words for a nice romantic-comedy like this. The film gets a bit soap opera-like at times, and is a little long. OVERALL - Despite the good outweighing the bad, and a generally likable group of characters, I really never had the urge to watch this a second time. Oh, and a postscript: those soccer players in the World Cup that just concluded did Cuba proud with their ""swan dives"" throughout the tournament. One minute they were dead; the next minute, alive and kicking!",Jerry Maguire
11,moonspinner55,"Tom Cruise works admirably hard, but the strain sometimes shows...",6,20 October 2005,"Tom Cruise gives one of his looser, less self-conscious performances as a sports agent, a self-described ""shark in a suit"", who loses his job with high-profile company and strikes out on his own; Kelly Preston is the fiancée he loses touch with, Renee Zellweger is the single mom whom he connects with, Cuba Gooding, Jr. won a Supporting Oscar as his number one client. Literate, yet occasionally pretentious, overextended comedy-drama that uses every conceivable romantic-movie trick to wring tears from its sugar-coated scenario: the single mom and her cute kid, the emotional client and his pregnant wife, the movie star grins in close-up from Cruise...they're all part of a cinematic formula, yet the film does work on a fantasy kind of level. Zellweger really shines in her role and gives the slick proceedings a gritty, naturalistic sheen that is both curious and perfectly charming. A big box-office hit that shows a fair amount of sophistication, despite the faint whiff of superficiality. **1/2 from ****",Jerry Maguire
12,blanche-2,A sports agent finds the high road steep,8,28 March 2008,"Tom Cruise, before his chin implant, is ""Jerry Maguire"" in this 1996 film also starring Renee Zellweger, Cuba Gooding Jr., Jay Mohr and Bonnie Hunt. Beautifully directed by Cameron Crowe, the film tells the story of a hotshot sports agent who writes a piece about the ethics of being a sports agent, encouraging a smaller client list and more personal service. He then passes it out to the rest of the agents in the firm, SMI. It goes without saying that he's fired, but before he goes, he asks if there is anyone who wants to go with him as he sets out on his own. A single mother, Dorothy (Zellweger), inspired by his missive though partially blinded by the stars in her eyes, says yes. Jerry ends up minus his fiancée (Kelly Preston) and stuck with one client (Gooding) that no one is particularly interested in, a football player whose mantra is ""Show me the money!"" But no one is. As he struggles to make a lucrative deal for his client, Jerry has to also deal with his personal life - Dorothy and her love for him, which he can't really return, her mistrusting sister (Hunt) and Dorothy's son (Jonathan Lipnicki) whom he adores.This is a fast-moving film with wonderful performances and lots of warmth, humor and honesty. Jerry learns quickly that when it comes to money, he's friendless, that there's very little loyalty and lots of liars. Tom Cruise is excellent as a young man trying to find his way through a labyrinth of a client with a bad attitude, no money, a hasty marriage and staying with the principles in his manifesto. Zellweger, in her career-making performance, is sweet and touching as Dorothy. Gooding has the most flamboyant part and makes the most of it as an athlete who has to learn that in order to have someone show him the money, he has to show a little heart first.A great movie, highly regarded for a reason, with a soundtrack to match. Highly recommended.",Jerry Maguire
13,Quinoa1984,"remembered for so much, and it's actually a pretty good movie",7,28 December 2018,"Tom Cruise is so Tom CRUISE here he out Tom Cruises when Ben Stiller has done Tom Cruise (or should I say Tom Crooze?) He is practically everything that he has ever been asked to do as an actor, minus the running and action stuff (oh, no, wait, he does run a little bit in the climax, how about that) and it's one of his major performances (to the point where I wondered a few times if this could be an unintentional sequel to Risky Business). He, and not Cuba Gooding Jr (who is fine but given a largely two dimensional character, a type to be sure), deserved the hell out of that Oscar. This is his movie, and he rules at every moment.The movie around him is fun and entertaining, and it's Cameron Crowe also at his most...Crowe-ish (for better or worse, mostly better, from his can't-help-himself wit to the musical choices, from the Who to Miles Davis), though not as deep as it might think it is early on. It also has a wonderful turn from Renee Zellwegger, a sleazy turn by Jay Mohr, and Jerry O'Connell for a few key scenes in one of his best turns (hey, no small roles, right?) The key thing for me about all this: Jerry Maguire was one of my cinematic blind spots until... Well, now.I knew all of the major cultural references (it's just how it is, whether it's seeing a parody long before the actual source, to a Patton Oswalt bit about seeing it on Christmas), and seen a few scenes here and there, but I'd never seen it start to finish. What I come away with is... It works. Mostly. Largely on movie star charm and some snappy Crowe dialog that only occasionally is too, uh, cocky for its own good.It also is a much more compelling story when it's focused on the sports world, and the first part seems to be indicating it'll be largely about that. And then roughly halfway through, when the thrust of the story should be about how Jerry picks up the pieces and gets back on track, Crowe remembers he wants to kick in his romantic comedy/drama plot and it takes over. Arguably, a bit too much and yet, there are some really touching scenes late in the film between Cruise and Zellweger, like it almost makes up for a sluggish middle.Jerry Maguire, not without flaws, is what used to be a quality example of a popular and massive Hollywood hit in the mid 1990s. I wonder now if it would go straight to Netflix or not, with a different star. Is it still an iconic Hollywood piece of the 90s? I dunno. But I did laugh. And I could see how Crowe could go down the path he has for the last 15 years.",Jerry Maguire
14,wes-connors,Sucker Punched,5,18 January 2010,"After he inexplicably describes himself (in opening narration) as one of ""thirty-three out-of-shape agents,"" toothy ""sports agent"" Tom Cruise (as Jerry Maguire) is fired from his job at ""Sports Management International"" (SMI), due to some unlucky breaks. And, possibly because he distributed some subversive literature about life's simple pleasures. Leaving the company of superior Jay Mohr (as Bob Sugar), Mr. Cruise invites SMI employees to follow him, and form a new group.Alas, only pretty blonde Renee Zellweger (as Dorothy Boyd) accepts Cruise's offer; she has been admiring his handsomeness from afar. Unfortunately, Cruise persuades only one of his clients to join his new team - but, when it's football player Cuba Gooding Jr. (as Rod Tidwell), one is obviously enough. Mr. Gooding Jr. also serves as Cruise's best friend and advice dispenser. And, Ms. Zellweger comes with one of those cute and cuddly kids, enhanced by a prop dreamy pair of over-sized glasses.With all these ingredients, how can Cruise lose? Well, how? Cameron Crowe's ""Jerry Maguire"" is a well-produced attraction. It increased Cruise's box office and critical success; and, it significantly advanced the careers of Gooding Jr. and Zellweger, who were heralded by many as ""Supporting Actor"" and ""Newcomer"" of the year. The film is full of catchphrases. Gooding Jr. teaches Cruise how to shout, ""Show me the money!"" Zellweger tells Cruise, ""You had me at hello,"" and the man says, ""You complete me."" The film celebrates concussions - as long as you don't die from one.***** Jerry Maguire (12/6/96) Cameron Crowe ~ Tom Cruise, Cuba Gooding Jr., Renee Zellweger, Jonathan Lipnicki",Jerry Maguire

After suffering a nervous breakdown as a result of stress and a guilty conscience, he writes a mission statement about perceived dishonesty in the sports management business and how he believes that it should be operated. He distributes copies of it, entitled ""The Things We Think and Do Not Say: The Future of Our Business"".

17,grantss,Schmaltzy but works...extremely well,9,31 January 2016,"Schmaltzy but works...extremely well.A highly successful sports agent, Jerry Maquire (played by Tom Cruise), starts to realise how cynical and superficial his job and industry are. In a moment of inspiration he drafts a manifesto, noting what is wrong with the industry and how it should change. For his forthrightness he is fired. All he has left is one client, Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr), and his new agency only has one other employee - a former colleague, Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger).The movie that propelled writer-director Cameron Crowe into the cinematic big league. The first movie he directed, Say Anything..., was great but low-key. Jerry Maguire, his third movie, was even better and was a big deal.Emotionally manipulative but very enjoyable movie. Nice, feel-good, underdog story with heart. Quite funny too, at times. Fairly profound too - some good comments on the superficiality and cynicism of modern sport, business and society.Tom Cruise is in fine form as Jerry Maguire. He plays his ideal role - charming, dynamic and heroic. He got a Best Actor Oscar nomination for his performance.However, the performance that glues everything together, grounds the movie and prevents it from being too syrupy, plus provides the most entertainment, is that of Cuba Gooding Jr. Great work on his part - over-the-top and funny. He deserved his Best Supporting Actor Oscar.Good work too from Renee Zellweger and Jonathan Lipnicki (as her child).Excellent soundtrack too, as you would expect from Cameron Crowe, him having been a Rolling Stone music reporter in the 1970s.Great entertainment.",Jerry Maguire

19,TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,Not sure whether this is a chick flick or just a generic bad movie...,5,19 December 2004,"I saw this a few years ago, and didn't quite see why everyone was praising it so much. I attempted to watch it again a year or two later, still desperately trying to figure out what everyone was praising the movie for. Then I borrowed it from the local library a few days ago, and today I saw it again... I'm still as baffled by its reputation as a good film as I was when I first saw it. It seems to be a chick flick, since just about all of the elements are there... but maybe it is just a generic bad movie that has gotten popular because of the star power or whatever. I mean, everything in the movie... the obnoxious little kid, the weak attempts at comedy mostly consisting of old stereotypes, the unbelievably poorly implemented and uneven love-story... no. Just no. I can only guess that the popularity of this film lies in a strong audience of people who are either easily impressed or girls who are into chick flicks. Possibly both. The plot is OK, but the pacing is awful. It moves unforgivable slowly and seems twice as long as it is... at least. The acting is flat or overplayed... everyone seems either terribly uninterested in the material or to not be sure how to perform, and therefore overdo it. I can't believe that this was actually done by Cameron Crowe... come on, he made Almost Famous and Vanilla Sky, two movies that are great at best and impressive at the least. How could he screw this up? I recommend this film only to the biggest fans of the people involved in the making of it, and possibly fans of chick flicks. Everyone else; don't listen to the hype. It's not the least bit interesting or involving. 5/10",Jerry Maguire
20,evanston_dad,"You Lost Me with ""You Had Me at Hello""",6,16 June 2009,"Fairly entertaining sports film that works best when it's focused on Tom Cruise's at-loose-ends agent and his client, played by Cuba Gooding, Jr. But the film crashes and burns when it becomes about the love story between Cruise and Renee Zellweger's character. Writer/director Cameron Crowe has proved time and again that he can't write female characters worth a damn, mostly because he treats them the way adolescent boys treat women when they ""discover"" them for the first time.This film goes down smoothly enough, but it's too long and Crowe's writing style is too self-consciously cutesy for my taste (""Show me the money!"" ""You had me at hello""). This wasn't even close to being one of the best films of 1996, its Best Picture Academy Award nomination notwithstanding.Grade: B-",Jerry Maguire
21,anaconda-40658,Seek the Money!,9,4 March 2016,"Jerry Maguire (1996): Dir: Cameron Crowe / Cast: Tom Cruise, Renee Zellweger, Cuba Gooding Jr., Jay Mohr, Jonathan Lipnicki: Effective drama about caring for those you do business with as oppose to just making a quick buck. Tom Cruise stars as sports writer Jerry Maguire whom everyone seems to love until he loses his job and his clients. He issues a challenge to others to join him independently but only Cuba Gooding Jr. remains who beams, ""Show me the money!"" Directed with insight by Cameron Crowe with low grade production. Crowe's work seems aimed at the idea of youthful conquests and the ability to dream big until standards are met high. He previously directed Say Anything and Singles, also about the ambitions of young America. Cruise plays Maguire as a man cheated by the system yet regains just enough faith to rise up. Gooding Jr. is great as a football player who remains as Maguire's client right up to a booming finale. Renee Zellweger appears as a loyal supporter in a predictable role but ultimately enacts our sideline cheering. She is the one co-worker who joined him upon his challenge after termination. Jay Mohr play his sleazy ex-boss in what could have been standard yet he brings out the conniving qualities. Jonathan Lipnicki plays Zellweger's son who delights his scenes with his young charm.

22,FlashCallahan,You had me at show me the money.......,7,2 August 2014,"Jerry Maguire is a successful sports agent, and he has it all, until one night he questions his purpose, his place in the world, and finally comes to terms with what's wrong with his career and life. Recording all his thoughts in a statement, Jerry feels he has a new lease on life. Unfortunately his opinions aren't met with enthusiasm from his superiors and after being stripped of his clients and elite status, Jerry steps out into the sports business armed with only one client and the only person who believes in him.with the impossible task of rebuilding what he once had, he faces the harsh truths which he'd ignored in the past and a host of hardships that he'd never faced before.....How you feel about this film is basically how much you like Cruise. On any other planet, or reflective dimension, it would be called Tom Cruise: the movie, because he's never off screen for more than thirty seconds, and even when he is, his voice is probably evident.But its a brilliant performance from the star, he actually makes you care for this spoilt, greedy, shallow, consumerist hack, and you actually want him to succeed.Now whether this has anything to do with the fact that most of the other characters are more shallow than him (Mohr, and Preston, who are both brilliant), or from the second act onwards he is with Dorothy Boyd, could make a difference on the narrative, but then you have the relationship Cruise begins to have with the young boy, and you can literally see the materialism leaving his body.This is the film where Cruise should have won an Academy award, he is brilliant, and its one of his finest performances, Gooding Jr. on the other hand, isn't really that good when you think about it, his award was nothing but a fluke, as all he does is shout, cry and scream. Does that mean my eight month old son will win next year?The soundtrack is great, its a feel good movie, and yes, the lines are still utterly quotable today.But avoid if you don't like Cruise, or actually, do, you'll change your opinion and realise you like Cruise as an actor....",Jerry Maguire
23,movieman_kev,"A tad overrated, but still enjoyable",7,14 October 2005,"Tom Cruise is Jerry Maquire, a sports agent, who is stupid enough to feel a sense of remorse for seeing the contracts as being the number one prioty and writes an endless Mission statement going on and on about everything wrong with the way things are done, Needless to say he's fired soon afterwords. And needs to start anew, losing his fiancé, and most of his clientèle. The only two that choose to stick by him are a desperately clingy lady just wanted to be loved and a young up & coming conceited black football perspective with a nagging, holier than thou bitch of a wife. While Maqurie rise to the occasion and seize what he has left? This movie, while being one of Cameron Crowe's lesser works (basically an over-glorified chick flick) is still pretty good and better than Crowe/Cruise's next collaboration (the remake of ""Vannila Sky) by far. All of the actors acquit themselves as well as can be expected with the over-sentimentalized script. Plus you can't hate a movie with a young kid who says adorable things, that's why that tactic is used way to often in film. Even though it didn't accomplish the suspected job of making one feel good about oneself in the least bit.

Can they rise from the ashes? Kelly Preston, Bonnie Hunt and Regina King are also on hand.Jerry Maguire"" (1996) is equal parts spirited drama, romantic comedy and sports flick. It effectively illustrates how the fast-paced cutthroat world isn't interested in inspiring, well-meaning truth, but that doesn't negate the value of honest friendship, genuine love and, most of all, loyalty.It's all-around 'hip' and entertaining, slowing down for the mid-section. But the last act drives everything home and is moving. It pretty much represents the best of the sometimes dubious genre (romcom).The film runs 2 hours, 19 minutes, and was shot in the Los Angeles area as well as the Phoenix/Tempe region of Arizona, including Lost Dutchman State Park just east of there.GRADE: A-",Jerry Maguire

26,namashi_1,Fun!,7,13 January 2011,"Cameron Crowe's 'Jerry Maguire' is a Fun and Happening film, that has gained cult-status over the years. 'Show Me The Money' echos throughout the film, even when the characters weep in sadness.'Jerry Maguire' is a yet another story, that can be termed as a 'Rags To Riches' kinda satire. Over-here, 'Jerry Maguire', The Hero loses everything, but eventually gets his job right. Failure shatters him, but success enlightens him.Cameron Crowe's Screenplay packs in tremendous characters, each one stands out. His writing is sharp at most places, and the connect with it's hero remains intact. His direction is splendid almost throughout. The only shortcoming, is it's running time. 139 minutes seems a bit too far-fetched. If 15-20 minutes shorter, the flick would have been an ideal 10/10 fare. Nonetheless, Crowe has done his job right.With such tremendous characters in hand, the performances were bound to be memorable. Tom Cruise is superb as 'Jerry Maguire'. He lives his character in each and every frame. Cuba Gooding, Jr. is absolutely legendary in a supporting role. Renée Zellweger is excellent, while Regina King is spontaneous. Beau Bridges, Kelly Preston, Jerry O'Connell, Jay Mohr & Bonnie Hunt lend very good support.On the whole, do check this one out, as it offers entertainment and proficient performances. Thumbs Up!",Jerry Maguire
27,Smells_Like_Cheese,"Meh, it's over rated",4,18 October 2004,"I saw Jerry Maguire quit a few years ago. When it first came out. My parents had rented it. I was like 11 years old. So, I didn't really understand it. And I didn't want to review it based on my 11 year old view. Sometimes they change. Well, I just watched it on TV, and I can see why I still didn't enjoy it. Tom Cruise was just a little too flat in this film. The only thing I did enjoy was Renee and the little kid with the big glasses. He was pretty cute. And the line ""Show me the money!"". Ahh! How many times must I hear that horrible line? It gets annoying eventually. It's not a horrible film. The story is somewhat interesting. But the performances aren't that grand. And the film is nothing you'd want to see over and over again. You'll just have to see for yourself.4/10",Jerry Maguire
28,MovieAddict2016,I still can't warm up to this movie,5,20 August 2005,"I still remember the fuss ""Jerry Maguire"" made when it came out back in '96 and I still remember the first time I saw it and wondered what the big deal was.I respect Cameron Crowe and I think he has good intentions. ""Almost Famous"" is a really, really good chronicle of its era. It had interesting characters who I felt for.""Jerry Maguire"" is cold, distant, and frankly, rather boring. Clocking in way past its limit, it's basically about a loser sports agent Maguire (Tom Cruise) who suddenly finds all his friends and co-workers and even family turning against him as he nears middle-age.The moral is effective - don't let your life be ruled by materialism -- but it's hardly a subtle one. Even Rene Zellweger's character is a huge cliché, being the female love interest who is pure, good-natured, sweet, and represents everything Jerry doesn't have in his life. (His current fiancée in the film is portrayed as a materialistic fraud.) The whole yuppie culture thing is kind of over and ""Jerry Maguire"" would have worked a lot better during the '80s, a decade Crowe seems more comfortable with (he penned ""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"" after hanging out at a real high school).There's something about this film I've just never been able to warm up to.",Jerry Maguire
29,lasttimeisaw,a feel-good treat concocted with a conscience,7,9 July 2017,"For those who endearingly miss Tom Cruise as a fine actor, or Cameron Crowe at the top of his games, JERRY MAGUIRE is a blast from the past. Our titular hero (Cruise) is a smug predator in a cutting-throat capitalistic business, who suddenly grows a conscience, and then immediately makes a wrong move, trying to exhort his peers to also grow a conscience, unfortunately the majority of those is too cynical to accept his noble motion, he is therefore blackballed and according to Murphy's law, must hit the rock bottom, which only leaves him a loyal admirer/accountant Dorothy Boyd (Zellweger), his only client, an under-the-radar football star Rod Tidwell (Gooding Jr.) and a goldfish. Tailored to USA's pernicious winner/loser ethos, the subsequent upswing must diligently tackle two most important things a man must obtain, his career and his love life, to prove the world that he is not a loser but a bona-fide winner, aka, it is the ""kwan"", that really matters to one's truth worth, a magically coined word by Crowe. Cogently the film thrives as a sincere page-turner albeit Crowe being rather deferential towards all the genre tropes, his script coruscates with a cordial sympathy towards Jerry's fix and a tangential self-awareness of eschewing the mawkishness, conceivably, it is a story borne out of affection and deliberation, but one defective looms large in the end is that Crowe doesn't get more into the agent business maybe because it is not his forte, the triumphalism is approached through Rod's doughty sportsmanship (a cinematic but garden-variety antic with a sharp tang of cruelty, in real life, more often than not, a player is physically permanently damaged), and what Jerry has attributed to the triumph is regretfully left largely untapped, however he would right this wrong in his next film ALMOST FAMOUS (2000), which is more in his element, inspired by the days when he was a contributing editor of Rolling Stones Magazine. One might argue JERRY MAGUIRE is the film where Tom Cruise's Hollywood golden-boy charisma is in his highest voltage, and his effort is incontrovertibly contagious, ever so remarkable he devotes himself entirely to a character which is quite self-referential in a manner (riding a money- seeking business, deviled by commitment issue, cannot deal with being alone), sheds self- consciousness and flexes his muscles to bring forth exigency, compassion and warmth, in company with a honest-to-goodness romance playing off against a self-abasing Renée Zellweger, who also punches above her weight in a conventional ugly-duckling role but spiffed up with a strong sense of dignity and sensibility, she knows when to waive what doesn't worthy of her even it is what she really wants, that is in my humble opinion, the most valuable takeaway of the whole movie. The homey atmosphere is also magically graced by a heart-melting Jonathan Lipnicki as Dorothy's cutie son and Bonnie Hunt's protective but amenable elder sister (although that divorced women group gag should be relegated to a cheesy chick flick dud).Lastly, about Cuba Gooding Jr.'s Oscar victory, he does strut his stuff with a highfalutin bravado, errs on the side of being clownish but essentially an entertaining hoot, like the film per se, a feel- good treat concocted with a conscience.",Jerry Maguire
30,Rainey-Dawn,Impressive Sports Dramedy,8,21 October 2014,"I really did not think I would like this film - at all in fact. When the movie first came out to rent, my (now ex) boyfriend suggested we watch the film - he told me I would really like this movie. I said ""ok"" so during our dinner date we watched Jerry Maguire (I was reluctant and kinda turned up my nose when the movie first started). Well, by the time the movie ended I was thinking ""Wow! The movie was actually really good!"". Well, I have to say I had to eat my own words about this movie - it's actually worth watching and I did like the movie more than I was ever anticipating - it's not boring.Jerry Maguire is good sports dramedy (comedy-drama).

31,Lejink,Louder than bombs...,3,20 November 2011,"Not really my type of film, but I gave it a go. It's brash, in your face, very loud, a typical modern Hollywood mix of profanity and morality. I had no connection at all with any of the main characters or their situations, I mean I could care less about the contractual expectations of US sports stars and as for the somewhat forced romance of Tom Cruise's maverick sports agent and his acolyte Renee Zelwegger and her, shall I say, ""professorial"" five year old kid, (I'm being kind, I almost thought a grown-up actor was playing the role, so un-child-like was the boy's performance, never mind the dialogue he's given to speak).And no, I didn't like Cuba Gooding's over-the-top performance as Cruise's only remaining client after he alienates his former employer and co-workers with a mass-circulated touchy-feely ""mission statement"" to cleanse his conscience and soul. Talking loud and saying nothing, as James Brown once said. There were a few good lines and situations but these were hopelessly outnumbered by many more which were poorly conceived and executed and while I understand ex-Rolling Stone magazine writer Cameron Crowe filling up the soundtrack with 60's and 70's tracks by the Who, Stones and McCartney, none of the songs has any relevance to anything in the film.As for the acting, it was universally flashy and shouty, with no exceptions and you can see each of the leads acting if you watch closely enough. For a far more incisive and entertaining exposé of the soft white underbelly of sports and at a deeper level, morality at large, I'd suggest viewers look at Billy Wilder's ""The Fortune Cookie"" instead.",Jerry Maguire
32,ElMaruecan82,"Behind every great man, there is a (great) woman ...",8,6 October 2012,"Is ""Jerry Maguire"" a heart-warming romantic comedy with sports as a subplot? Or a sports drama with romantic undertones? Or is it a fascinating character study introspecting the professional and private life of a sports pro manager, and the way these two poles of his personality influence and affect each other? I like the third option, especially since the title says it all; it's a film about a man named Jerry Maguire.So, who's Jerry Maguire? At first, he strikes as the kind of character tailor-made for Tom Cruise; Maguire is the guy who's successful both in business and privacy. In fact, the two worlds interact so intensively that you can't quite differentiate between his friends, his colleagues and his clients, even his fiancé, Avery (Kelly Preston) is an ex-athlete. Tom Cruise is the ultimate yuppie and he plays the part perfectly with this extraordinary capability to make himself unlikable enough so you can better perceive his redemption, the same way he did in ""Rain Man"". But ""Jerry Maguire"", as if Cameron Crowe, the director, was already aware of its viewers' expectations, is pleasantly surprising because the redemption comes right at the beginning.After a series of eye-opening incidents, one night, Jerry wakes up and has a sort of breakthrough illumination; he realizes that he wasted his life, by cumulating a generous quantity of clients (professional athletes) without taking time to understand them, to deal with them in a decent way. Struck by this rebirth of humanity, he writes an inspirational memo titled ""Things We Think But Do Not Say"". The memo elevates him into a sports management guru status except that he's the only one who seems to believe in his new humanistic theories  him, and a young accountant, Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zelwegger) who 'saw the light' through Maguire's inspirational words. And naturally, when Maguire is forced to leave the company, she's the only one who chooses to follow him, she's the kind of women who stand for her beliefs.Then, Jerry and Dorothy work together with the only client who stays, Rod Tidwell, a football player, smaller than average, flamboyant, truculent  maybe a little too much, and he's played by a scene-stealing (and Oscar-winning) Cuba Gooding Jr. And it's funny how Gooding seems to embody the trademarks of Tom Cruise's archetypal characters through his cockiness and exuberance, but that's part of his 'character', I mean within the movie. Tidwell believes he's a great man, and naturally behind him, there's a woman, his wife Marcee (Regina King) who keeps a vigilant eye on his career's evolution. She doesn't trust Maguire but she gives it a shot. Tidwell trusts him and stays out of loyalty. And Boyd genuinely loves him because she knows there's something good inside that man. Maguire is a good guy because good people believe in him, and it works the other way, too.Indeed, the 'friends' in the beginning, the pedant Bob Sugar (Jay Mohr) and Avery, not to mention the cocky football player named Cush (whom I just discovered, was the chubby Vern from ""Stand By Me""), they all represent the dark side of Maguire's world, and it's only when he gets fired, when he leaves Avery and is betrayed by Cush' father who ends up signing with Sugar (leaving Tidwell as Maguire's only option), it's only when he's an outsider from that cynical world, that we start rooting for him. And Cruise is perfect because it's crucial that Maguire starts being unlikable enough so we can give him the benefit of the doubt and then supposedly change but not enough to make us lower our guard. The suspicion must remain whether he's a good or a bad guy, if he's going to make it because he believes in his ideas of if he's going to sell his soul back to the devil. It's a two- way process, Rod considers him a friend, not his wife. Dorothy loves him and so does her adorable little kid, Ray, but her sister (Bonnie Hunt) is perplexed. Well, we expect a happy ending, but it's all in the ""how"" and ""when"" it will happen. The film deals with human relationships with a powerful mix of cleverness suitable for a comedy drama and touching tenderness, incarnated by the beautiful Renee Zelwegger, in a breakthrough performance that should have earned her an Oscar nomination. She's so adorable, so unbelievably sweet, that she puts something new and unusual in romantic comedies: genuine, shameless, passionate and innocent love. There is something quite gutsy in the way Cameron Crowe's film tries to cover sports, character study, romance in one story, but the multi-layered format works because Jerry Maguire remains the center of gravity. Dorothy Boyd is a great character because she awakens the best out of Jerry and saves him from his own megalomania. Ironically, Jerry does the same with Rod, also blinded by his own ego too and obsession with money. The way the two stories interact transcends a lot of predictable elements, and even when it doesn't avoid some archetypal situations, the acting makes everything believable. We know that Maguire will get back to Dorothy, but the way it's handled never feels forced and insincere. Jerry listens to Rod who's got the greatest day of his career, and he's simply talking to his wife. Jerry knows he can be a great man, but only if behind him, there's a woman, not any woman: a 'great' woman.The film is notorious for having introduced many iconic lines in Cinema's Dictionary: ""show me the money"", ""you complete me"" and last but not least ""you had me at 'hello'"", a line that owes more to its awkwardness than romantic appeal. Interestingly, the romantic catchphrase was used in the American Film Institute's 100 Passions montage right after Nicholson's ""You make me want to be a better man"". And after watching ""Jerry Maguire"", I understood this is exactly why Dorothy Boyd was a great woman.",Jerry Maguire
33,ThomasDrufke,Loyalty Without Intimacy,9,15 May 2015,"Cameron Crowe is a genius. Every movie is made to make an audience member feel something. Whether it be laughter, horror, entertainment, or maybe just to be feel good. I simply don't think there is a better director at just making you feel good about life. He must be a tremendously happy person or maybe just too optimistic. No matter, I love his movies. Some would argue that at times his films feel too happy and perhaps unrealistic, to that I say nonsense. I don't mean nonsense as in they are completely invalid, the arguments have a point. I just don't think that always matters. Movies are made to be enjoyed and entertained by, and Crowe almost always comes through there.Jerry Maguire is about a sports agent who is down on his luck after being fired and is left with only one client who still stands by him. But what it's really about is a man with major intimacy issues, who learns how to enjoy life with his heart more than with his wallet, or lack there of. It's pretty much Tom Cruise's quintessential role and one that he very well could have won an academy award for. Cruise not only brings some surprisingly well timed comedy, but a great amount of heart and realism to Jerry. Renee Zellweger also has a career defining performance as Dorothy Boyd, a single mom and a co-worker of Jerry. Crowe has a knack for creating great chemistry between romantic co-stars. Zellweger and Cruise are great together, along with the hilarious son of Boyd, Ray. It's the scenes with all three of them that really touched me in a way that only some films do. Not to mention just how funny the three of them, particularly Ray are in the film. For a film that isn't straight comedy, it made me laugh a whole lot.With Cameron Crowe you also get a great soundtrack and score. Nancy Wilson does an impeccable job scoring at the right times, and the soundtrack choices couldn't be more spot on with the various moments throughout. But it's also Crowe's ability to make an admittingly predictable film feel fresh and re-watchable. He surrounds the wonderful main cast of Cruise, Gooding Jr, and Zellweger, with standouts Regina King and Bonnie Hunt. The writing, music, and direction are all top of the line as Jerry Maguire is simply one of the most enjoyable films I have seen recently. To go along with the fact that being a huge sports fan, it was fascinating to see how the agent business may work. Of course, the film is famous for the endlessly quotable lines, but I feel like the enjoyment of life is what I'm going to take from it, and really how little money can mean in the grand scheme of things.+Cruise at his absolute best +Real romance +Quotable lines +The kid is hilarious +Great sports film +Supporting cast -A little bit predictable9.7/10",Jerry Maguire
34,g-bodyl,Overrated!,7,26 June 2009,"Jerry Maguire is perhaps the most overrated film of any Oscar winner. I'm not saying that this film is bad, but it's not really that great either. Basically, this film is a decent chick flick with elements for men and women.Tom Cruise plays a sports agent similar to baseball's Scott Boras. He eventually loses his job and it's up to a football player played by Cuba Gooding Jr. to find himself.The acting is great. Maybe Gooding does deserve an Oscar. Tom Cruise once again did something right. This film also boosted Renee Zellweger's career.The reason this film is overrated because the story is lame. You see the same thing happening in almost every chick flick. Gets boring after awhile.I did like the music. There are some great tunes by Bruce Springsteen.Overall, this is a decent flick. Why it got nominated for 5 Oscars, I don't know. I rate this film 7/10.",Jerry Maguire

36,inkblot11,"Still one of the most enjoyable Cruise films ever, shot Zellweger to stardom, too",9,27 August 2013,"Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a hotshot sports agent. As such, he wants to get the fattest contracts for his clients because his own salary depends on it. He has a type A girlfriend, Avery (Kelly Preston) and a seemingly great life. But, one day, he has an epiphany. Jerry has seen the tears in the eyes of the children who wonder why Mr. Maguire is still talking money when their father or mother is gravely injured and probably shouldn't play again. Therefore, Jerry pens an open letter to his fellow agents at their huge firm, asking them to follow their hearts and not just the dollar signs. Although everyone initially claps Jer on the back, he is soon dumped. The executioner"" (Jay Mohr), a more senior agent, does it in a crowded restaurant where he also announces his plans to ""takeover"" everyone of Maguire's clients. All too soon it happens. Jerry retains only one athlete, Rod (Cuba Gooding, Jr.), an iffy client due to injuries. Cleaning out his desk, Jerry bravely tells the entire office he is opening his own agency and asks someone, anyone to go with him. Only one does. That would be Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellweger), a single mother of one darling son, Ray (Jonathan Lipnicki), who admired greatly the stance he took in his open letter. Yet, for both Jerry and Dorothy, the whole start-up biz is an extreme risk, with only one sure client. Meanwhile, Avery dumps her fiancé on his ear when he loses the chance to represent a rookie NFL quarterback. Truth is, Jerry's old agency told a bunch of lies to steal this young man away. To complicate matters more, Jerry asks Dorothy out on a date, which goes well. Can romance and infant businesses make a good mix? Will Maguire, who stuck his head out for something good, now have it chopped off in the cruel world of capitalism? This is without a doubt Cruise's most enjoyable flick. Even folks who think they don't care for him will enjoy this one. It doesn't hurt, of course, to have sidekicks in Zellweger, Gooding, Jr., Bonnie Hunt, Mohr, Preston and the darling Lipnicki. Then, too, Cameron Crowe, who wrote and directed this gem, deserves lots of praise as well. To complete the movie's success are great costumes, sets, and photography. Come on, folks, re-runs of The Big Valley are nice but why not snag this film instead if you've never had the pleasure of it?",Jerry Maguire
37,The-Sarkologist,More than about showing him the money,8,20 April 2013,"This is a Tom Cruise movie, but I did not hold that against it. For some reason I wanted to see this movie, not because it was a Tom Cruise movie, but because of the plot about how the main character, Jerry Maguire, lost his job as a sports agent and then went out on his own to build up his empire again.The plot is not that shallow, rather the character of Maguire begins as a business orientated, money loving, sports agent until he is confronted with the reality of his character through the hatred of the son of a badly injured ice hockey player. At this point he realises that his desire is to purely make money off of other people and that he does not care about the person whom he is making money off. At that point he writes a mission statement which he intends to change the whole industry with - and even though he is congratulated with his stand, the competitiveness of the industry means that the younger agents seize this moment of weakness and throw him out. In the ensuing struggle he manages to gain two stars to work for, and then the famous one walks out on him leaving his with an angry black football player who wants a great contract but is not willing to work for it.Through the movie we see Maguire's character struggle through his problems, and his character rely on what are defined as his weaknesses. At the bachelor party at the beginning his one major weakness is revealed: he needs a woman to support him - he cannot be alone. So when he looses his job, he also walks out on his star fiancée because he simply feels that he does not deserve her. He has lost everything else so by all intents and purposes, he should loose her as well.This is where the other character comes in. An accountant at the firm Maguire worked for who was inspired by his mission statement. When Maguire calls for people to leave with him, she is the only one who does, but she also has a desire - she wants an husband and a father for her child. This is strengthened through the movie as she continues to look at people in love and think about how she wants that for himself. This is bad because Maguire can't be alone, and she knows that, so she sees her chance and takes him. The thing that makes this a little different is that Maguire loves her kid.This weakness of Maguire's is continually exploited as he struggles with his single client, who is so stubborn that he refuses to leave Maquire, but he also refuses to listen to Maguire's advice. In the end they must settle with a weak contract because there is little else that they can get. It is only when he breaks out of his shell that things start to happen, and because Maguire has been his friend as well as his agent, this relationship is strengthened.But his character is also there to show what a strong marriage relationship is all about. As we watch Maguire and his secretary romanticise over each other, we know that it is not a relationship of love, but one of necessity. When they do get married, we know that it is because Maguire simply does not want her to leave as opposed to really loving her. The illusionary relationship is developed as it is contrasted with that of Maguire's client. We see a husband and wife who truly love each other, while Maguire and his wife seem to drift apart as Maguire spends more time with his client and his son.This is a great movie, and it is surprisingly deep for an American movie. The characters are finely crafted and they each have to struggle through their problems, all of them looking for the easy way out but knowing that it is not the best way out. For a Tom Cruise movie, it is actually quite good.",Jerry Maguire
38,slightlymad22,A New Record For Cruise,8,2 October 2017,"Continuing my plan to watch every Tom Cruise movie in order, I come to Jerry McGuire (1996)Plot In A Paragraph: When sports agent Jerry Maguire (Cruise) has a moral epiphany and is fired for expressing it, he decides to put his new philosophy to the test as an independent agent with the only athlete who stays with him and a former co worker.In a time when I'm becoming less and less interested in new movies, Jerry Maguire reminds me why I love movies. Cameron Crowe has wrote and directed a really good movie. A movie that is all about its characters, and whose main character spends much of the time desperate and out of luck. Movies like that can be depressing and a tough watch, but Jerry Maguire isn't. It is not without its problems!! It's a tad too long, has too many subplots, we get your standard sports movie cliché scene, and the kid is a little too movie cute too. Cruise (who won the golden globe) holds the full thing together he is literally in every scene. You need to root for the hero in the movie, and you do root for Cruise, who spends more time on the ropes here, than in any other movie.I find Cuba Gooding Jr really annoying here!! He is just so loud!! All he seems to do is yell!! I could not spend more than 5 minutes in a room with his character!! I'm amazed he won the Oscar. Something Crowe is good at, is giving characters with a small amount of screen time, personalities that made them stand out! Regina King is really good at standing out in her small role. Kelly Preston, so adorable in Twins, is so unappealing here and Jay Mohr is perfectly sleazy as a rival sports agent.Jerry McGuire was nominated for 5 Oscars and grossed $153 million at the domestic box office to end the year, the 4th highest grossing movie of 1996. This was Tom Cruise's fifth consecutive 100-million-dollar-plus film, a new record at the time.",Jerry Maguire

Very entertaining comedy/drama/romance that is well acted and excitingly joyful. I love Tom Cruise in every scene and Cuba Gooding Jr. was legendary he deserved the golden globe he got.

40,Thanos_Alfie,Nice story...,7,4 February 2019,"""Jerry Maguire"" is a Drama - Romance movie in which we watch a very famous sports agent having under his guidance many top athletes when a night he has a moral epiphany after working for many hours. In his epiphany writes a text, prints it in many copies and distributes it to everyone in the firm he works for, he is fired and now he has to search as an independent agent for other athletes. Only one athlete stays with him and his former secretary.I enjoyed this movie very much because it had a very good plot and a well-written script. In addition to this, there is a nice direction with some plot twists that I didn't predict so, that made this movie even more interesting. Regarding the interpretations of the cast, I believe that Tom Cruise who played as Jerry Maguire made for one more time an exceptional interpretation and I also believe that Cuba Gooding Jr. who played as Rod Tidwell made his best interpretation so far (Academy Awards, 1997 Oscar Winner - Best Actor in a Supporting Role). Another good interpretation that has to be mentioned was Renée Zellweger's who played as Dorothy Boyd and she was very good at it. The direction which was made by Cameron Crowe was very interesting and I enjoyed the way he presented the many changes in the life of Jerry Maguire and how he had to fight in order to get back on track and also how this influenced his personal life and the people loved and cared him the most (great character evolution).Finally, I have to say that ""Jerry Maguire"" is a nice movie to watch with a very good direction, a well-written script and many good interpretations made by its cast. I recommend everyone to watch this movie because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it and you are going to have a lot of fun. The contrast of this movie between drama and comedy scenes is very well placed and makes this movie very interesting.",Jerry Maguire
41,Dr_Coulardeau,Love is what makes the world turn round,9,7 September 2007,"It's not a masterpiece but it is a very good film not so much for the meaning it may contain but for the images it sends in the audience. First it gives a positive image of sports by showing how one man, one agent can be different from all others in this ""industry"", and that the main difference is to believe in what he is doing, to believe in what his heart is telling him, to work with his heart and to love the players, the athletes he is working for, he is working with. That emotional, personal and very close relationship is what everyone needs all the time to feel needed, supported. The film shows that this is also the winning method because athletes want that contact and they can recognize that human attitude and they will work for this warmth of the heart, from the heart and in the heart. And what's more this relationship will enable the athletes as well as the agents to face the difficulties life is made of and life brings up all the time. This will mean success to the athletes as athletes and success for both the agents and the athletes financially. What's more the film conveys another tremendously positive image because the agent is white and the athlete is black and their relationship is one of trust, total friendship and confidence, one of love nothing but love and care and that is the right model to send in the public: what is important is not the differences among people but the possibility to establish trusting and loving relationships beyond these differences and accepting them totally.Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines",Jerry Maguire
42,Floated2,Romantic comedy disguised as a sports movie,3,21 June 2019,"This movie seems to be a mix of many different genres (comedy, romance, drama, sports, money) and we can see as to why it is such loved. But as a film, it is actually quite pretentious, and overly long and sappy. The sports angle starts off as intriguing but once the romance and love story come in, it takes away from the excitement, and becomes a predictable rom-com.The performance from Tom Cruise is him playing his essential character, lovable guy but also a slick ""all about me"" type. He's the lead and who we are supposed to root for. Cuba Gooding Jr. won an Oscar for his role but was playing a more over the top athlete type, and came across as annoying- yet people love his character and performance for how ""authentic"" it is. And Renee Zellweger is the love interest but happens to be a rather weak and uninteresting character. Also her son is one of the more annoying and corny characters in the film.People love this film for its famous catchphrases (""Show me the money!"", ""You complete me"", ""You had me at hello"") and it has a nostalgic feel.It seems that Cameron Crowe desperately tried making a film to ponder to many different demographics, and seeing its box office resume and the fact it won or was nominated for several awards, he succeeded in that sense. But as an audience opinion, the film isn't serious enough to be a drama, not funny enough to work as a comedy, too womanly to be a sports movie, and too sporty for a Lifetime movie.Overall, Jerry Maguire is watchable and somewhat intriguing at times, but as a while is quite long and becomes a bore. It really is a romantic comedy disguised as a sports film. Not nearly as great as people clamor for it.",Jerry Maguire
43,eddie_baggins,Cruise steals the show in this feel-good Hollywood romcom,7,8 May 2017,"A huge hit for all involved upon release in 1996 (where does 20 years go?), for some reason I've never shown Jerry Maguire ""my money"" and watched it in its entirety, despite it being the film that spawned an endless count of imitators trying to redo instantly classic scenes or launched the careers of Renee Zellweger and the Oscar winning Cuba Gooding Jr.Before he went on to make the other instantly recognisable and well-regarded Almost Famous, director Cameron Crowe combined his skills as a writer and a feel-good director to give us this insight into sports agent with heart Jerry Maguire and his fight against the odds to keep his head above water but while the film masquerades under this disguise Crowe's film is quite simply a Hollywood romance between Tom Cruise's Maguire and Zellweger's caring single mom Dorothy Boyd, whose young child Ray (played by Stuart Little's very own brother Jonathan Lipnicki) just about steals the show.Lathered in Hollywood schmaltz and filled with a loud American bravado thanks to Cruise and Gooding Jr's turns, it's hard to know how Crowe's film would be received had it been released in today's climate but as with many 90's rom-coms you go in expecting things to be more fanciful and over the top than we've come to expect from the modern age's more realistic ventures and it would take a viewer with a heart of stone to walk away from watching this uplifting tale not feeling some of those good vibrations that Crowe has largely failed to recapture in his career since (just look at Aloha).Finding himself completely entangled in this feel good romance is it's star Tom Cruise who delivers arguably one of his most likable and complete turns as the driven yet always appealing Maguire.If there was ever questions as to why Cruise was and still is one of the world's most bankable and relatable on screen persona's, it's likely that Jerry Maguire would answer them in one clean sweep.Showcasing an energy, likability and delivery of important scenes that very few actors could dare to muster up, Cruise is without a doubt the quintessential Maguire, that person than can make anyone drink their Kool-Aid and in almost every scene of a movie that runs over 2 hours, Maguire ends up giving Cruise one of his most rounded and memorable acting gigs which is no small feat in a career filled to the brim with lasting classics.Not everything works within the film however. Some scenes fall flat and Gooding Jr's Oscar winning turn is hard to support when watched under current conditions, all yelling and hyperactivity, it's not exactly the type of performance that you'd call the ""year's best"" although those feel good vibes and the films overall success no doubt influenced many who were under the spell of Crowe and his audience appeasing venture.A fun, smile inducing film that's influence can't be underestimated, Jerry Maguire is over the top and filled with Hollywoodized moments, plus it's fair share of over the top scenarios and performance but with Crowe in the best form of his career as a filmmaker and Cruise on peak likability mode, Jerry Maguire is a film worthy of its reputation even if it's not quite the classic some would label it to be and absolutely a product of its time.3 ½ memo's out of 5",Jerry Maguire

With the exception of ""Mission Impossible"", Cruise had six or seven movies in a row that I either didn't like or had no interest in. When I finally caught up to ""Jerry Maguire"", I found it impossible to resist. It is not a perfect movie. It does lose it way for a little while.

49,PWNYCNY,"Corny, contrived, shrill.",5,21 September 2005,"This movie is about two guys, both of whom are on the fringes of their respective professions, neither of whom are particularly liked, both of whom who are angry and disillusioned, who transcend their racial differences to form a bond of friendship. This movie strives to achieve greatness, and fails. If it wasn't for Tom Cruise, this movie would have been entirely unwatchable. Just another pretentious movie.Ever watch a movie the first time and like it, then, some time later, watch the same movie a second time, and not like it? Well if that's happened to you, then you will understand where I'm coming from. After watching this movie the first time, I was really impressed with the story and with the acting, and overlooked some major annoyances in the story. But while watching this movie a second time, the annoyances and contrivances were so glaring that they could not be ignored. The relationship between Jerry and his co-worker ... no, his secretary ... no, his girlfriend ... no, his partner ... or whatever, was so awful that it made me cringe in embarrassment; nor was the girlfriend particularly attractive or smart. What was worse was the girlfriend's son, whose role was played by an actor who has to be one of the most bizarre-looking and bizarre-acting child actors ever in the history of Hollywood. This kid made Spanky and Alfalfa seem as normal as apple pie. Then there was Jerry Maguire himself. Who in their right mind would want to have anything to do with a loser like Jerry Maguire? Yet the director apparently wants the audience to believe that Jerry is really a good guy, even after getting punched on the nose and kicked in the stomach by his fiancé, who couldn't take Jerry's erratic behavior anymore. Not exactly the stuff for an entertaining movie. The one character I did like in the this movie, however, was Jerry's one and only client, an angry football player who, unlike Jerry, had reason to be angry and who demands that Jerry get his act together, do his job and show him the money. Yet the relationship between Jerry and his client is so contorted, contrived and improbable that even allowing for literary license, it's hard to buy (get the pun?), even for a movie. After watching this movie for a second time, my advice for any would-be professional athlete is to avoid a Jerry Maguire and represent yourself instead --- you'll get a better deal.",Jerry Maguire

If you ask me, Alan Silvestri's score was absolutely romantic. In addition, I thought that the performances were superior, the directing was excellent, the costumes were perfectly designed, and the casting was perfect. Also, I was surprised that Dorothy (Renee Zellweger) decided to stick by Jerry (Tom Cruise) after he got fired. In addition, when he got dumped by Avery (Kelly Preston), my emotions were mixed. I'm sure yours will be, too. I laughed really hard when Rod (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and Jerry yelled, ""Show me the money!"" Before I wrap this up, I'd like to say, ""Kudos to Cameron Crowe and everyone involved for a job well done."" Now, in conclusion, if you are a Tom Cruise, Cuba Gooding Jr., or Renee Zellweger, I highly recommend this movie. You're in for a feel good time, so see this movie today. You're in for a good time, so go to the video store, rent it or buy it, kick back with a friend, and watch it",Jerry Maguire
51,davispittman,Very well acted film!,8,17 March 2017,"Perhaps one of the most quoted movies is Jerry Maguire (1996). So is it really worth all the hype? I think so! Tom cruise and Renee Zellweger give masterful performances in this sports agent drama. Tom of course is always great, he's one of my very favorites, but if I'm being honest, Zellweger shines the most of all here. ""You had me at hello"". That probably is the most popular quote of the whole film, and it's deserving of that title. That is just good heartfelt writing, some may think it's cheesy or overly cliché, but I just think it's her character being honest about her true love for cruise's character. Cuba Gooding Jr. is the actor who won the academy award for his supporting performance, and yes it's true, he is very good here, I'm not totally certain it was worth an Oscar, but it's still good work. The script is pretty well written, it's all centered about tom cruise and his revelation as a person, and the romance between Zellweger and him is all apart of his big change in himself. The chemistry between all the actors on screen is good and believable, cruise and Zellweger having the best and most real seeming. I suggest this movie for both men and women, young and old, you certainly do not have to enjoy sports to enjoy this. Hell I'm living proof of that. 8/10 for Jerry Maguire.",Jerry Maguire

53,slokes,Touchy-Feely But Fun,7,9 November 2009,"The best thing in the DVD of ""Jerry Maguire"" is not even the movie itself. It's the complete text of the title character's controversial ""Mission Statement"", invested by writer-director Cameron Crowe with the same passion, humor, and character-consciousness that drove his Rolling Stone profiles and script for ""Fast Times At Ridgemont High"".The movie is pretty good, too.Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a high-flying agent about to sign the most-prized NFL recruit in the country when a crisis of conscience forces him to write and distribute the aforementioned mission statement. Summararily canned by his agency, he's forced to scramble to save his career, with the help of his assistant Dorothy (Renée Zellweger) and their one client, head-case wideout Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.)With this movie, it becomes clear that Cameron Crowe took the ball from John Hughes and ran with it. The kind of films Hughes used to make, of weepy love scenes and whipsmart wisecracks set against an esoteric pop score, are the kind of films Crowe makes, only with adults. In that way, ""Jerry Maguire"" satisfies.What grates about this movie, and more with other Crowe films like ""Almost Famous"", is the way people speak to each other in the form of taglines rather than actual human speech. ""Just jump right into my nightmare, the water's warm!"" ""I'm her disapproving sister."" ""I've had three lovers in four years, and all of them ran a distant second to a good book and a warm bath."" ""That's more than a dress. That is an Audrey Hepburn movie."" ""Help me help you!""At least Crowe has the good sense of turning the last line into a running joke. He also is helped, unlike ""Almost Famous"", with the kind of top-notch cast that can make the most of groaner lines like the almost-infamous ""You complete me"".Cruise is electric on screen, finding the perfect channel for his high-energy persona in the always-on Jerry. Zellweger has a lot of gooey moments, but extracts every ounce of rightness from them to make for a compelling emotional center. Jay Mohr as a rival agent is a wonderfully hateful foil. I can hear him say ""Whatever"" now.Gooding won an acting Oscar for ""Maguire"". Watching him, you understand why. Every time the film seems ready to sag into some touchy-feely moment, his Tidwell is on hand to keep things hopping and real. I can't say I understand why exactly Jerry is constantly questioned about the honesty of his feelings for Dorothy, though it is a major theme of the film's last hour. It's probably why ""Jerry Maguire"" is not a guy film despite the sports setting. When people talk and talk so openly about their feelings, I feel like a nun at a Sam Peckinpah double-feature.This film didn't quite have me at hello, but kept me watching longer than I expected. Give Crowe credit for investing his chick flick with enough humor and energy to keep things from getting too soft. Give Cruise and the rest of the cast praise for strong performances around the horn. And give Dicky Fox a big salute for that fabulous final line. I wish you the same thing he did.",Jerry Maguire
54,gcd70,Rewarding relationship tale,7,5 June 2008,"Writer/director Cameron Crowe (""Say Anything"" and ""Singles"") seems to be very much in touch with human emotion as he penned this story about relationships. On the surface ""Jerry Maguire"" appears to be about a down and out sports agent who is desperately trying to keep life and soul together as his world crumbles about him. Really though this touching, often funny film is primarily concerned with the relationships we have with the ones we love.Cruise has found some form again as he looks for true meaning in his work and his personal life, though he never seems to be able to get a handle on his emotions nor his true feelings. Renee Zellweger is also thoroughly enjoyable in her debut as the faithful accounts clerk who believes in Jerry's ideals more strongly than he does, but who ultimately only needs his love, not his admiration or friendship. Both the leads are easily, and quite willingly, outdone by young Jonathan Lipnick, too cute as Dorothy's six year old boy who steals many scenes and gets some of the funniest lines. A special mention must go to Cuba Gooding Junior in his Oscar winning role. His is a passionate portrayal of an aging footballer whose sincere love of his family is not reflected in his game. Also stars Bonnie Hunt, Kelly Preston, Regina King, Jerry O'Connell and Jay Mohr. Bruce Springteen's ""Secret Garden"" provides a moving love theme.Many times Crowe seems more in tune with women's feelings than men's, so spot on are his female characters. A shame that such an insightful drama didn't have the morals nor the 'truth' to go with it (money doesn't matter, as long as you've got plenty of it seems rather a confused message).

At times this movie felt like a male love story masquerading as popular entertainment.  But you had to put up with the ever-annoying other members (except Bonnie Hunt & Jerry O'Connell) of this ensemble, and God knows I can live without ever hearing THAT phrase ever again.  All in all, I'd recommend the movie, but probably not for any reasons that would be widely acceptable.

I knew Jerry Maguire had been widely talked about and also knew that it, and it's performers, had been up for numerous awards but had felt no strong desire to see it. That was a mistake, as this was throughly enjoyable.This was a great movie about love,friendship and the highs and lows of the entertainment industry. (When your hot-everyone loves you-but when your not....well..)This was a difficult story for me to watch. I've worked in entertainment and been where Tom cruise's character was(bottom). This movie really hit everything on the head and in addition to the realism of the characters(sadly this type of thing happens way to much in ANY industry) manages to inspire hope as well without being to over the top and the main characters are both likable and interesting. It's a really good film.I really enjoyed Tom Cruise tremendously and as I'm not a big fan of his(or wasn't until now) that was nice. Renee was as always flawless and I was bowled over by Cubing Gooding's performance. (I had particular interest in seeing him to see who could possibly beat out Ed Norton for best supporting actor.) I won't say he was better then Norton but he WAS great and he earned his Oscar and nailed the character to the tee. This movie also has some absolute great quotes like(here it comes): SHOW ME THE MONEY!!If anyone reading this hasn't seen the movie go rent it. I really have very little, if anything negative, to say.",Jerry Maguire
57,Spleen,Down with chick flicks,4,14 December 1999,"I thought this was supposed to be about a sports agent.  What's Renée Zellweger doing there?  What's that unendurable kid doing there?  I can just HEAR the cynical clanking of gears in the writer's mind.  `Okay - so the average member of the audience will simply fall asleep when we show it the story of an ethical quest.  Look how Quiz Show' fared.  So we'll write this quote, love story, unquote, one that has NOTHING WHATEVER to do with the basic plot, and we'll make the hero go through both the love story and the real story simultaneously.'Only it's worse than that.  Jerry Maguire undergoes his change of heart too early in the film - all we find out about him beforehand is that he's the kind of person with a conscience on the point of rebellion, and then - surprise! - his conscience rebels.  We don't see how he became corrupted in the first place or how he escaped corruption in the end.  Well, maybe we'll see some more of this corruption-in-the-sports-agency theme later.`Well sorry,' says the writer, `screen time is limited, maybe I can spare half an hour from my contrived and sappy romance, but I tell you what: I'll let you watch Cuba Gooding, Jr. bellowing at people in a zany fashion. That's vaguely to do with sport, isn't it?  After all, he's a -' (consults notes) `- football player.'Finally - SPOILER AHEAD - I have one more question for the writer.  I don't know much about American football (apart from the fact that it's STUPID), but when Jerry urges Rod to play in such away that he swings through the air and lands smack on his bare skull ... how is that any different from what he does to the bedridden footballer, at the start of the movie?  I mean, he makes the bedridden footballer risk concussion in the pursuit of money, and Rod risk concussion for the love of the game, but in either case the result is concussion.  And what is Rod's reward?  He gets to make a zany-antics ad for one of those reptilian sports shoe companies, in exchange for a fat cheque.  Nope - no naked greed there.",Jerry Maguire
58,raulfaust,yeah know what i'm doing,7,10 January 2011,"Jerry Maguire is a drama-romance which seems to be just another sport movie, but it is not. It has the problems involving media, capitalism, doping, money and feelings. It's sad the movie had that clichéd part: when Jerry read the final contract that stated if the athlete had health problems the contract'd be over, I instantly knew one of these things would happen: or Tidwell would break something of his body or he would make we all think he really did when actually it was just a shock. And the second guess happened. Also, I didn't feel a good chemistry between Dorothy and Jerry - which is good, because we've already seen tons of movie where the couple is perfect and made for each other.And I feel this movie is a bit overrated, but that doesn't influence my rating since I don't think it deserved more or less than 7/10.",Jerry Maguire
59,PredragReviews,"""You had me at Hello""",8,12 May 2016,"This film spoke to me in so many ways. It was almost as if ""Jerry Maguire"" had been written with me in mind. From Jerry's epiphany at the start of the story through his struggle and eventual triumph over his fear of intimacy, it all seemed to be drawn from my experiences. These are the things that concern me every day. Tom Cruise was amazing. He showed perfect acting the whole time. It is perhaps, the finest work so far in his career. You could see every flicker of doubt and insincerity cross his face. I was laughing out loud, then crying and then so tightly happy that I forgot to breath. All of the other cast members seemed perfect as well. I particularly liked the doubting, divorced but totally caring sister Laurel. And let's not forget Dorothy's son Ray, what a little charmer.The person that stole the show for me was Cuba Gooding Jr. Every scene he was in made me laugh. This was the first movie I had seen him in and thought he was a terrific actor, deserved of the Oscar he won for Best Supporting Actor. The ""Show Me The Money"" scene will have you in stitches. His character changes the life of Jerry Maguire in the film and does it with such of enthusiasm that you can just admire Rod Tidwells life, where every piece is in the right order. The beautiful cinematography, editing and music makes the strong story and characters to look good. Yes I agree that it's very emotional, touchy and sweet, but why should we deny that we need that sometimes.Overall rating: 8 out of 10.",Jerry Maguire

He thinks, lives and acts fast, he's a popular guy who earns buckets full of money and has everything except a conscience. But than on one night he gets an epiphany. Money is no longer the most important thing when doing business... He writes it all down, gives his text to all his colleagues and bosses and gets almost immediately fired for it. He decides to start as an independent and all a sudden no one seems to like him anymore except for two people. A young football player and a female accountant. Together with them, he'll try to prove the rest that he is right and that the others are wrong, that he's still a very good agent, that he still has a nose for talent,...This movie is a mix of several genres: drama, comedy, feel-good movie and romance, but somehow seems to be able to keep everything well balanced. I'm not familiar with Cameron Crowe's work, but this movie certainly makes me want to see more of it. Of course the director isn't the only one that makes a movie work. The acting is done very well too, but what else can you expect from a cast with Renée Zellwegger, Cuba Gooding Jr. and Tom Cruise in it. OK, having big names in your movie doesn't necessarily mean that it will all work, but this time it did. It all looked very real and believable to me.I'm not saying this is the best movie I've ever seen (there can be only one the best), but this one certainly gave me a good feeling. Sometimes it was perhaps a bit too corny, but overall I liked what I saw and that's sometimes very rare in Hollywood movies. I give it a 7.5/10.",Jerry Maguire
61,MartianOctocretr5,"Cruise Bored Me at ""Hello""",4,18 February 2006,"This is an awkward attempt at linking a sports movie with a romance story. It might have worked much better, except the focal point of both stories is, regretfully, Tom Cruise.Cuba Gooding, Jr. plays an athlete who keeps Jerry McGuire (Cruise) as his agent, after some kind of skulduggery by fellow agents costs Jerry all his other clients (not a well-developed sub-plot, by the way). Gooding's fast babbling and shouting sometimes became an earful, but overall it an interesting and likable character. Gooding made ""Show me the money!"" a commonly-quoted sound-bite.This was the first time I saw Rene Zellweger, and her performance as Dorothy was touching and sweet. You feel her growing sadness and frustration at her situation. Like Gooding, she gave us a memorable line: ""You had me at hello."" Johnathon Lipnicki is great as her son, who bonds with Jerry instantly, but is confused by his behavior.Then there's Tom Cruise. As usual, he over-emotes, swings his arms all over the place when he's talking, looks bewildered at everything, and turns in yet another uninspired role. Like so many other movies, strong acting by his co-stars carries the load and Tom just poses for the camera with the same old glazed expression. Unfortunately, he's playing the title character, and as such, should do something beyond reading from cue cards.Without Cruise, the film might have warranted a 7.

62,sme_no_densetsu,An ideal showcase for Tom Cruise expertly crafted by Cameron Crowe,8,25 February 2016,"In a career full of high profile movies, ""Jerry Maguire"" represents perhaps Tom Cruise's single best performance. Playing a sports agent fired from his job after having a moral epiphany, Cruise's effortless charm fits the role perfectly. His character's slick exterior comes naturally but what's surprising is the depth of emotion that's exposed over the course of the movie.Cameron Crowe's Oscar-nominated script is integral to the success of the film. With the premise established, the plot follows Jerry as he desperately holds on to his last remaining client (Cuba Gooding Jr.) and the one co-worker who stood by him (Renée Zellweger). Part love story, part comedy and part sports drama, the movie should not be dismissed out of hand as a typical shallow rom-com.As already noted, Tom Cruise is the movie's anchor. His Oscar nomination was well deserved but he didn't have to carry the movie by himself. Cuba Gooding Jr. made the most of his character and found his career-best performance rewarded with an Oscar. Renée Zellweger excelled in her role as well, which turned out to be her breakout performance. Of the many notable supporting players, the most memorable are probably Regina King, Jay Mohr and young Jonathan Lipnicki.Visually, the movie is exceptional. Cameron Crowe's deft direction and the vibrant cinematography of two time Oscar winner Janusz Kaminski combine to create a consistently attractive viewing experience. The well-chosen soundtrack also deserves praise, with several memorable selections, including the Bruce Springsteen hit ""Secret Garden"".All in all, ""Jerry Maguire"" is a movie that holds up surprisingly well and represents some of the best work from those involved. Not just a typical Tom Cruise vehicle, the movie captures something special with memorable moments like the classic ""Show me the money!"" scene.",Jerry Maguire
63,Howlin Wolf,An immensely likable movie. (POSSIBLE SPOILERS),10,30 March 2001,"The reason this film succeeds despite initially appearing to have a poor premise is its fantastic writing. The characters at once seem like real people we can identify with, but not so mundanely 'real' that they forget to say something funny now and again. The dialogue is by and large NOT full of banal observations about the economic state of the sports industry, because Crowe wisely realises that the crowd who go to see romantic comedies will most likely not care about that aspect. What they WILL care about is mostly sympathetic characters, a believable central romance and an ounce of chemistry between the two leads. Crowe and his performers ensure that they get all that, and at times unexpectedly more too...The film does occasionally lapse into sentimentality with the whole 'play with your heart, not for the paycheck' thing, but this is offset nicely by the charm of the leading players and Maguire's acknowledgement at the beginning that his 'rebirth' will sound ""somewhat 'touchy-feely'..."" The supporting characters are all so skillfully drawn too, that even if the central relationship doesn't quite work for you, you're sure to find something of interest in the more minor characters. A particular standout here is Jay Mohr as the slimy agent ""Bob Sugar"". He shows real talent here and it's a great surprise (possibly down to poor script choices) to see that he's still woefully underused by Hollywood.Whilst Cuba Gooding Jr is fine here, I still cannot believe he won an Oscar for his performance, as he doesn't come anywhere near matching the other talent on show. I'm not saying that Cruise should have won an Oscar, but I could have understood that a whole lot more...Great soundtrack too. You can tell as much care has gone into the composition of that as has the rest of the movie. A rare thing in today's market, that's filled with horrendous ""Music inspired by.."" rip-offs.(At the time of writing... ) this is STILL the only Cameron Crowe film I've seen. Judging by the mostly glowing reviews heaped upon his other works, it seems safe to say that Jerry Maguire isn't merely a lucky one-off for this director. The film really is delightfully enjoyable to watch.",Jerry Maguire
64,michaeltrivedi,Show Me The Money,7,2 October 2019,"Jerry Maguire is a good film, probably among Tom Cruise's best. It's a funny joyous movie, and it moves right along.Cruise plays a sports agent, who gets fired and left with only one football player on his roster. The movie depicts him making this one client a superstar through hard work and dedication.It's definitely a film about rising up from a difficult place. It's also a romantic comedy, which is built in right beside the other stuff.7 Stars",Jerry Maguire
65,bobsgrock,"Mediocre film, superior stars.",7,6 October 2008,"For the movie Jerry Maguire, a story about a sports agent who feels he isn't being completely honest in life and decides to write a career-changing mission statement about his thoughts, there really isn't too much wrong with it. There also isn't too much right with it as it is pretty straightforward the whole way through and lags in a few areas. However, the bright spots far outshine the dim ones in this terrifically acted story that tugs on the heartstrings and gives an inside look as to how the sports business is run.Written and directed by Cameron Crowe, this has the feeling of an insightful drama that wants us to consider how we conduct our lives and be brutally honest with ourselves and those around us. Indeed, there are plenty of long monologues about people not being honest with each other and how that affects our lives. I'm sure most of us already knew that, but that doesn't take away from this movie and how great the acting is by Tom Cruise as the title character, Renee Zellwegger as Dorothy, the woman who believes in him, and Bonnie Hunt as the no-nonsense sister. The show-stealer, though has to be Cuba Gooding Jr., who won an Oscar for his role as a loud-mouthed by very loyal athlete that is keeping Jerry alive. Certainly not a bad film, but just a mediocre, Jerry Maguire is fun to watch and learn from.",Jerry Maguire

67,hnt_dnl,The REAL Best Picture of 1996!,10,19 June 2009,"JERRY MAGUIRE is genius! Proof that with the right direction, writing, and acting, a film can be exceptional no matter how untested it's subject matter might be. Who'd have thought a film about a sports agent and his early mid-life crisis of conscience would be such a watchable, enjoyable flick? Not me! The anchor of this wondrous film is none other than Mr. Tom Cruise, who of course plays the title role. This is arguably the best work that Cruise has ever done. He makes you believe that he truly is this man who has had up to this point has lived a very fun, yet unfulfilling existence. The key to this crisis is that Jerry is himself unsure about what the future holds for him, but he takes the risk of going out there and regenerating himself and focusing not on what is profitable, but what is right. Rightfully so, Cruise was nominated for Best Actor by the Academy for this film, and flat out should have won! In retrospect, it shouldn't have even been a question.Cruise gets magnificent support from newcomer Renee Zellweger (who plays Dorothy Boyd and who should have been nominated for Supporting Actress), Bonnie Hunt (Dorothy's sister Laurel, who I wouldn't have minded getting a nom also!), and Cuba Gooding, Jr. (who actually won Best Supporting Actor as Jerry's sole client NFL wide receiver Rod Tidwell). Special mention should go to Jonathan Lipnicki (as Dorothy's son Ray). Regina King is also wonderful as Rod's wife, Jay Mohr as Jerry's rival agent Bob Sugar, and Kelly Preston as Jerry's girlfriend early in the film.Dorothy worked at the big firm that Jerry was fired from after his crisis and leaves with him to start his own agency. A very uneasy and uncertain relationship forms and it seems more like a business partnership than anything. Then Jerry forms a special bond with Ray and he wants an instant family, even though it appears he is not in love with Dorothy. Jerry and Rod have an uneasy alliance also as Rod thinks Jerry is only interested in using him as a tool to jumpstart his new business and nothing else. In the end, the respective pairings form unbreakable bonds with each other. In particular, Jerry's revelation that he is in love with Dorothy, not just idea of stability and family, is memorable.The brilliance of JERRY MAGUIRE is that it dares to talk and discuss things that people take for granted all the time (dating, relationships, family, raising children, friendship). It treats all of this as the most serious of things. Characters actually question Jerry's motives and refuse to let him off the hook (and vice versa!). Dorothy and Rod see in Jerry things that no one else ever saw to, or cared to, see in him. In doing so, the payoff in the end makes you realize why it focused on all of this. Directed by the great Cameron Crowe (who also did SAY ANYTHING and ALMOST FAMOUS), JERRY MAGUIRE is one in a million!",Jerry Maguire
68,classicalsteve,Agent Seeks Something Higher -- Possibly Cruise's Best Film,9,31 August 2007,"At the 1997 Academy Awards, host Billy Crystal referred to the characters played by the five Best Actor nominees (of which Tom Cruise was one) as being ""a burned guy, a mentally-challenged guy, a mentally-abused guy, a paralyzed guy, and an agent. And four out of the five are treatable."" Of course Crystal was jokingly referring to the Agent as being beyond help. Among the figures of sports and entertainment, agents are often regarded as the necessary evil of the industry often with reputations as being the sleaziest of VIP's, just-above used car salesmen. Their antics which require a high-level of tough negotiations are sometimes seen as money-gouging and materialistic. In the film ""Jerry Maguire"", Tom Cruise decides to wear the shoes of a sports agent and walk around in them for just over two hours.""Who am I, and what am I doing?"" Jerry Maguire asks when he realizes his sports agency, SMI, tries to cover up the darker aspects of professional sports. His answer is inspiring, transcendent, and detrimental. He mistakenly writes down his inspired thoughts and submits them to his colleagues for suggesting the agency concentrate better on fewer clients. For his inspiration, he loses his place at his agency and many of his highest-paying clients to his rival Bob Sugar. Subsequently, he also loses his attractive but shallow fiancé. Maguire is forced to try and live his dream of being more caring and receptive towards the needs of his clients rather than just being there to get a slice of his athlete/clients' multi-million-dollar paychecks. In a particularly poignant sequence, he retains his client Frank ""Cush"" Cushman who is a leading contender in the NFL draft through a handshake with his father, played by Beau Bridges. However, on draft day, he learns through an unexpected phone call that his rival Bob Sugar, through deception, convinced Cushman to sign with him instead. Now, Maguire has retained only Tidwell, and he must create his new agency from the ground up with only a single client as his starting point.So the question asked of the movie is: Can a sports agent find a more meaningful, possibly spiritual, life and still acquire the high-paying clientèle? And maybe even more to the point, can an agent make a difference beyond just being a high-powered money negotiator? ""Jerry Maguire"" is a thoroughly entertaining riches-to-rags-to-transcendence story of a fantasy sports agent trying to find a deeper purpose to an otherwise materialistic existence.The film works at almost all levels, particularly because of the dynamism of Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr. in an Academy Award-winning performance, playing the only client willing to stay with Maguire. Part of the story is Maguire's journey from the purely material to a deeper and more-satisfying existence. Rod Tidwell (Gooding), wide receiver for the Cardinals, is a strange opposite to Cruise but has a similar problem. Tidwell is a devoted father and husband, emotionally involved with his family but does not quite give that same heart on the football field. The story becomes about both characters finding something deeper in their place in the world, Gooding giving what he gives to his family to his team, and Cruise giving to his clients and co-worker/lover Dorothy Boyd his love and attention. Renee Zellweger plays Dorothy Boyd in a passionate and sensitive performance that will definitely bring tears. Zellweger's son becomes an important character and also an inspiration to Cruise to find the deeper and more sensitive part of himself.In the materialistic world of late 20th-century America, ""Jerry Maguire"" is a breath of fresh air. A rare story produced by the money-obsessed film studios about the dangers of losing oneself for the sake of self-promotion and monetary gain. An interesting statistic has emerged of late regarding a high number of American businessmen on their deathbeds who begin regretting the direction and purpose of their lives. ""Jerry Maguire"" offers an alternative, although probably few in his position would find the wisdom to change course. But since you can't take it with you, life is about what you leave behind.",Jerry Maguire
69,hall895,There's more to life than money,7,24 October 2013,"You wouldn't think a sports agent would be a good choice to be the central character in any kind of romantic film. It is a profession with a reputation for sleaze and slime. But Jerry Maguire is not your typical sports agent. Well, he is at the start of the film. But then he has an ethical epiphany. Unfortunately this epiphany gets him fired from his high-powered agency. Jerry is left with just one client, Rod Tidwell. Rod, a wide receiver for the Arizona Cardinals, is brash, bold, bombastic and exceedingly self-confident. And with regard to Jerry he is interested in only one thing: ""Show me the money!"" When Jerry is cast out on his own with his one client he also has only one employee for his new start-up agency. That is Dorothy Boyd, a single mother who apparently was the only person at Jerry's old agency who shared his ideals. Or who was willing to admit she shared them anyway. She leaves her secure job to take a chance on Jerry and it becomes clear pretty quickly that she may have made a big mistake. But as Jerry flounders professionally he and Dorothy grow closer. They come to count on one another. They fall in love. At least they think they do. Their relationship is a challenge, a love story which it turns out may not include much love at all. Did they come together for love or for convenience? They know true love when they see it, as they do in the rock-solid relationship between Rod Tidwell and his wife. Seeing what Rod and his wife have only makes it more painfully obvious to Jerry and Dorothy what they are lacking.So this is a rather challenging romantic film. The main characters don't fall instantly in love and settle into a life of constant bliss. If this relationship is to succeed they are going to have to really work at it. It is an interesting journey Jerry and Dorothy take and director Cameron Crowe was fortunate to have two excellent performers filling those key roles. Tom Cruise and Renée Zellweger were at the top of their games here, playing off one another beautifully and creating two truly outstanding characters. The actors are certainly helped by Crowe's terrific dialogue, this is a script with so many memorable lines, both funny and poignant. Of course Cruise and Zellweger don't get all the best lines for themselves. Cuba Gooding Jr. shines, injecting so much life into the movie playing the outrageous Rod Tidwell. Bonnie Hunt provides some laughs as Dorothy's wary sister. Kelly Preston is a stunner, both in looks and in what she says as she plays another woman in Jerry's life. And there is also room for a wonderfully precocious child, Jonathan Lipnicki being incredibly endearing in that part. There's also Jay Mohr, Jerry O'Connell, Regina King, Beau Bridges...it is a really long list of quality performers and Crowe gives them all their moments to shine. There is a sense the movie struggles at times with the balance between comedy and drama. Is it a comedy that's trying to be dramatic or a drama that's trying to be funny? And how do you squeeze a romance into that mix? Oh, and it's sort of a sports movie too. Crowe really does have a lot going on here, maybe a little too much. But by and large it works. The movie manages to both entertain and charm you. And it is great to see the characters grow. Maybe even Rod Tidwell can come to learn that it is not all about the money.",Jerry Maguire
70,Karl Self,A Feel - Good Movie That Made Me Feel Bad,2,26 February 2001,"Come on people, give me a break.  Tom Cruise is a ""brilliant actor"", as long as his part is that of a smarmy yuppie scum bag.  'Coz that's what he is in real life.  However, a drunk SYSB is already beyond him, and giving him the part of a SYSB - turned - caring - new - man, as in this movie, is almost cruel.OK, Cuba Gooding Jr.'s acting is outstanding and genuinely funny (he got an Oscar for Best Supporting Actor), and Bonnie Hunt as Dorothy's ""disapproving older sister"" minimises the damage done by Cruise and Zellweger somewhat. But why do so many Hollywood flicks have to be so totally devoid of suspense and plausiblity and so full of sugary fakeness and drawing - by - numbers plot?Don't get me wrong.  I like escapist stories, I fancy Renée Zellweger something rotten, and I enjoy walloping in Hollywood mainstream middle - of - the - roadness, once in a while.

71,sharky_55,Show me the money!,7,17 February 2017,"Jerry Maguire is what happens after the kid in Risky Business grows up. The beginnings have the same glimpses of sharp wit, comic satire and endless ambition that gave the latter its humorous bite. Tom Cruise is the fast-talking hotshot, a one man Wallstreet of sports representation with a vice-grip over his domain: he scouts young stars early, adds them to his collection, and rakes in the cash when they hit the big time. His job is to know everything about these clients - their ambitions, their strengths, their prickly personalities - but at the same time his voice-over treats them like impersonal investments, with the highly-touted number one pick in the next draft as the biggest catch of them all. Only when his conscience hits a brick wall does he come to re-evaluate how he wants the world to see him, and how brutal this cut-throat business really is. So Jerry Maguire is really a romance, but not between Jerry and his designated love interest (the 'nerdy' girl who has always been shyly hiding behind her desk while he dates supermodels), but between him and his last client. Yes, these two men put on emotional facades of stoic, unmovable strength and attitude, but all they really need is a hug. That final sequence, where Rod parts the sea of cameras and reporters to intimately embrace Jerry, who's been hovering around nervously in the background? That's from Manhattan, from Notting Hill, from every single romantic comedy that ends with the guy/girl running after the guy/girl and sealing the deal with a dramatic declaration of love. How sweet. Cameron Crowe has never bettered his debut, Say Anything, which had more nuance and understanding than most films in the genre. In Jerry Maguire, the annoying add-ons come in the form of Dorothy Boyd, the woman destined to bring Jerry to his heels, to humble him, and to finally complete his redemption from selfish egomaniac. As if Crowe is afraid that audiences might not get what he is trying to say, Dorothy is also a poor, single, struggling mom - in fact one of the first signs of Jerry's renewal is his growing potential as a father to Raymond. Ray is not just cute, he's cuteness overload, with oversized glasses and a head of messy blonde hair. He's not playing a little boy but a cuddly teddy bear designed to assault our sympathies, to coax Jerry into the suburban dream. What kind of monster would deny Jonathan Lipnicki?Opposing Zellweger's damsel in distress is Avery, the poster-girl for the vanity of the high life. Both are just as shallow in personality, but Preston goes into comic overboard and finds hilarity in her best impression of a success barnacle. Watch how the break-up scene unfurls: it's a high speed walk and talk, her furiously setting up tables for work, and him tentatively trying to slide the bad news underneath. When it's revealed that he's the one doing the dumping, Preston attacks it like a challenge; success is not just a goal but a state of mind, and she's never faced an obstacle she can't climb. When Jerry shows signs of giving up and displaying a defeatist attitude, she takes him down right there and then. Later as they cross paths her finger and thumb are in the shape of a big L for LOSER. The people in this business rarely come out and show their intentions like this - she's just being upfront about it, like a peacock strutting its plumage. Preston brings some much needed levity when the film gets a little tired and bogged down in cliché. It's satire, but only just. And then there is Regina King as Marcee Tidwell, who is much more than just a negotiator on behalf of Rod. She is his wife, and of course wants a big, fat contract for her husband, but watch how King acts as a foil for Jerry. He's infuriated by the tiny contract offers for his client, exasperated that all his dealing and hand-shaking and smiling has been for naught (his monetary gain diminishes too). But she feels the disrespect for her Rod, and how the teams have denied his talent. In the heart-stopping climax, Rod lays unconscious and every character's real feelings and motivations emerge. If the whole thing is overly cheesy and melodramatic, Marcee reigns it back with perspective. Her moment is personal, and all the dollar signs have vanished. The plea in her eyes is a million times more meaningful than any ""You had me at hello"".",Jerry Maguire
72,jhclues,High-Energy Entertainment,9,14 January 2002,"By definition, and depending upon who you're talking to, `Success' can be measured in a number of different ways.  It's winning the competition, celebrating a Golden Wedding Anniversary or, to many, just making the most money.  The first two are absolutes; you win and you make it to number 50. No gray areas.  If you're not dead, you're alive; you're either pregnant or you're not.  But in regards to that third item on the list, what are the parameters by which you measure that particular success?  Are there lines across which you will not step to make that extra buck?  Or do you do whatever it takes-- including selling your soul and sacrificing your very identity-- to make as much of the green as you can.  Is that success?  Or is that selling out.  Can there, in fact, be true success when ethics and integrity are absent?  It's the territory writer/director Cameron Crowe explores in `Jerry Maguire,' the hit 1996 film that landed him an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay, a Best Actor nomination for star Tom Cruise, and captured the award for Best Supporting Actor for Cuba Gooding Jr.	Jerry Maguire (Cruise) is a high-powered sports agent for a huge agency, handling a portfolio filled with high profile sports figures.  And the name of Jerry's game is money; he gets the big bucks for those he represents, he keeps them in the limelight and in the end pulls down some mighty big bucks for himself and the firm.  But at what price?  Who is Jerry Maguire, really? Has he played the chameleon for so long as a means to an end that even he doesn't know who he is anymore?  Does he even consider it?  If he stopped to think about it, the answer would be a resounding `No.'  But then something happens.  One night, he wakes up and happens to look at himself in the mirror, and for whatever reason, it suddenly dawns on him what a selfish, soulless, empty life he is leading.  So in the wake of this epiphany, he seizes the moment, sits down at his keyboard and hammers out a `mission/morality statement,' in which he reorganizes his entire approach to his career, including reestablishing parameters and setting new priorities making conscience, ethics and integrity his paramount concerns.  And while still riding the high of his nocturnal enlightenment, he goes to his office, makes copies of his statement and distributes it to the mailboxes of everyone from his boss on down.  Then he goes home and goes to bed.
	In the cold light of morning, however, he realizes what he's done and races to his office to avert disaster.  Too late.  He enters the room to a hail of praise and appreciation from his peers, but his boss is less enthusiastic. It's no surprise to Jerry, then, when the big `M' his superiors are interested in turns out to be `Money' and not `Morality,' as in `Money talks, Jerry walks.'  And just like that he's out the door.  But before he leaves, he vows to make it on his own.  He's up, he's positive, he has his statement-- and he doesn't have a clue what to do next.  What he does know is that the adventure of a lifetime is awaiting.  And the world is about to meet the `real' Jerry Maguire. 	Cameron Crowe made his debut as a writer/director with `Say Anything' in 1989, in which he first exhibited that keen insight into the human condition that has been one of the trademarks of his success as a filmmaker.  In `Jerry Maguire' he demonstrates again that acute sense of knowing what makes people tick, and leaves no doubt that he knows how to convey it to his audience.  Crowe's story, as well as the presentation, is original and imaginative, and he fills it with real characters involved in very real situations.  And it's the characters that really sell it, because these are three-dimensional people, not just cardboard cut-outs, and moreover, Cameron knows how to get the best out of his actors to really bring them to life.	Tom Cruise was the perfect choice to play Jerry; he has the look, the energy and the talent to get inside this guy's skin and make him tick, and he successfully channels his natural exuberance into his character, tempering his performance just enough to make it really work.  An Oscar nomination does not come cheaply, and Cruise certainly deserved the one he received for his work here.	Cuba Gooding Jr.'s performance is deserving of the acclaim he received for it, as well.  As Rod Tidwell, the pro football player/client who sticks by Jerry and insists that he `Show me the money!' Gooding equals, if not surpasses Cruise's level of enthusiasm with a vibrant and rich portrayal that makes Rod one of his most memorable characters.  Like Cruise, Gooding is perfectly cast and points up, again, what an acute sense Cameron has for who and what will work to bring his story so convincingly to the screen.	Not to be outdone by her co-stars, Renee Zellweger gives an endearing performance as the vulnerable but steadfast, single mom, Dorothy Boyd. She's such a `giving' actor, and she endows Dorothy with a gentle, caring manner that expresses her deepest thoughts and feelings so well.  Her reaction, in the scene in which Jerry tells Dorothy-- with his back turned to her-- that he has broken up with his fiancee, Avery (Kelly Preston), is priceless, and alone makes this film worth watching (repeatedly).  Her work here is every bit as Oscar worthy as Cruise and Gooding's, and it's hard to understand why she was overlooked, as she is such a vital presence in this film.  9/10.	The supporting cast includes Jerry O'Connell (Frank), Jay Mohr (Bob Sugar), Bonnie Hunt (terrific in her role of Laurel Boyd, Dorothy's sister), Regina King (Marcee) and Jonathan Lipnicki, unforgettable as Dorothy's precocious son, Ray.  A triumph for Cameron Crowe, this movie is, indeed, magic.",Jerry Maguire
73,aciessi,Right on the Money,6,12 June 2015,"Show me the money. You complete me. You had me at hello. Jerry Maguire is Cameron Crowe's bread and butter. Without it, there would be no ""Almost Famous"". It's one of the most quoted movies of an entire generation. Perhaps that's what lessens the experience in retrospect. Oh yes, I liked this movie. I liked it a whole lot in a few sections. The beginning monologue and montage is absolutely golden. An exuberant, excellent hook that highlights the best of Crowe's ability, and why I admire him so much as a director. On that alone, the movie rockets itself into watchability, and seizes our attention for the 2 hours and 10 minutes it lasts. Rene Zellweger is really good here, as well as the ever adorable, Jonathan Lipnicki. Can we get a child star Oscar going? As if it wasn't enough, is ""Boyhood"" a better incentive to start? Cuba Gooding Jr., who won the Oscar for his performance, nails it. He's the smartest and funniest person in the entire film. He had Jerry in the palm of his hand the whole time, and he picked his brain like no other. SHOW ME THE MONEY, JERRY! The performances rule. What's the biggest flaw? Well, the screenplay. I know, 20 years down the line, any movie is going to become cliché, but for some reason, this movie has spectacularly clichéd moments. The closing speech that Jerry gives is one that really highlights it. So, freaking, corny. Cameron Crowe is a great writer (a genius actually), and this movie has many memorable scenes of dialog, but he's always had trouble with writing touching speeches.. something he's been struggling with pretty severely as of late...

The two reconcile, and all is right.

I rewatched it few weeks before last Christmas because I didn't remember it at all and when I re-saw it I thought ''Still very good''.Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a sports agent that feels like he has the world under his own feet. However this soon changes as he suddenly has a moral ephiphany and all goes bad for him: he is fired from his job, his longtime girlfriend Avery Bishop (Kelly Preston) leaves him and his team loses again. So he decides to change and in doing so he puts on his side Dorothy Boyd (Renè Zellweger), his secretary who was in love with him all the time and have as his only client his most trusted athlete, Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding jr). And this works: Rod accepts his new contract and he becomes finally the champion Jerry always hoped, and despite Jerry separates from Dorothy after a while, they later reconcile and she thinks that her son could have a future in baseball.This movie is very good and mostly for the acting: despite Tom Cruise is mostly famous for action movies like TOP GUN or the MISSION IMPOSSIBLE ones, here gives a very strong performance as a sports agent that restarts his life and succedds, and not surprisingly Cruise was even nominated for an Academy Award for this performance; René Zellweger gives one of her most famous performances as Dorothy Boyd, Maguire's secretary who ends up marrying him; Cuba Gooding jr shines as Rod Tidwell, a young athlete who is very difficult to satisfy (his most famous line ''Show me the Money!'' says it all) but proves to be good at his sport; Kelly Preston as Maguire's girlfriend and Jay Mohr as Bob Sugar give some very good performances in their resumes.In substance, this is more a drama than a romantic comedy and it proves that it's never too late to restart again if you want to improve on your life.

Jerry is a driven and ambitious sports agent for an international agency that represents professional athletes in all sports who has a crisis of conscience that motivates him to write a ""mission statement"", which turns out to be more of a defiant manifesto blasting everything that is wrong in his business. he distributes his ""memo"" throughout the office and though it gets faint praise initially, it does end up getting him fired from the agency. We then see Jerry try to continue his business though he only has one client who agrees to stick with him. Director-writer Cameron Crowe (FAST TIMES AT RIDGMONT HIGH; ALMOST FAMOUS)solidified his position as a master cinematic storyteller with this epic story told on an intimate scale. His extremely deft screenplay is sharply delivered by a perfect cast. This role seems tailor-made for Cruise and he makes the most of it. Cuba Gooding Jr. won a Best Supporting Actor Oscar for his star-making performance as Rod Tidwell, Jerry's most loyal client; Renee Zelwegger was the find of the year as Dorothy Boyd, the secretary from the agency who follows Jerry when he's fired and agrees to work for him and eventually falls for him; Bonnie Hunt scores as Dorothy's sister as does Kelly Preston, in one of her best performances as Jerry's shark of an ex-fiancée. Regina King should have received an Oscar nomination for her solid performance as Tidwell's wife, Marcy; Jay Mohr is quite funny as Bob Sugarman, a rival agent who is battling Jerry to represent another football player (Jerry O'Connell)who is being watched over by his protective dad (Beau Bridges). A rare gem from the 1990's that is not only grandly entertaining, but vividly real...there's nothing false or affected here (though some might find Gooding's Tidwell a little over the top), this film is one of those rare treats that is long, but you hardly feel it. A real treat and a must for Cruise fans.",Jerry Maguire
81,the red duchess,Brilliant Cruise transcends film.,5,31 July 2000,"It's enough to make one weep.  The first hour of this film is good fun, an exposure of a certain kind of American bluster, schizophrenically epitomised in Mr. American Bluster himself, Tom Cruise (hard business; 'touchy-feely' ethics).  The second half replaces this with another kind of bluster - cute kid, family values, success, reconciliation, redemption.  With a cute taste of misogyny too - women are either ridiculed divorcees (Crowe gets to mock two American bugbears in one - women and collectives), hard-nosed career, er, ladies (independent!  Sexually liberated!  Careerist!  Help mummy!), sterile wisecrackers, or dippy drips who despite being (presumably highly qualified) accountants in a multi-million dollar company, are dumb enough, despite being single mothers, to give up a well-paying job for a phoney ideal, are prepared to marry a cynical creep AND aren't actually impressive human beings in their own right, juggling family and career, but a kind of spare limb, a foot maybe, lying around, waiting to make Tom Cruise 'complete' - i.e. just another mother.  Same with Rod Tidwell, less a character than a series of amusing bits, whose own rich family life is just a reflection of what Maguire's is not.  His blackness, sponged by Maguier, probably makes the latter's whiteness complete too.This is a shame.  Crowe has never been the most visual of directors - you can see why he worships Billy Wilder - and the second half gets bogged down in dispiritingly trite speeches; but the first half is a pretty good deconstruction of Cruise's persona, brilliantly developed by Paul Thomas Anderson and John Woo in 'Magnolia' and 'Mission Impossible 2'.  All the familiar signifiers are there, presented in the classically flattering stylistic manner - the smile, the perfect hair, the easy beauty, the suits; but mostly the talk, the promises, the hyperactive loghorrhea, hiding a very empty core, a despair visualised by some sequences of dreamlike blue; we can see Maguire slowly break down, swallowed up by his own vacuity.  The 'mission statement' is a typically empty-headed response, a way to order the emptiness of his life, a kind of American dream, a purpose; the very American need to break ruts and drive for something, which is much easier than just changing what's wrong with the rut.Unfortunately, Crowe takes him at his word.  It is possible that the denouement, as with Rod's concussion, is pure fantasy, a fake injection of uplift in what had become a very gloomy film - Jerry's increasing the uppers to blot out some serious downers (and it is reassuringly American and capitalist that heart does actually mean money anyway).  Jerry is like a Western hero, interminably restless, roaming freely over states, but he is also a parasite, a horse dependent on a rider, a man of no active power, hanging on the decisions and betrayals of others.  This is like some kind of metaphor for (American) life, and the heterosexual family unit provides security against it, a fixed abode, a sense of coherent, whole identity and self-worth, a properly defined masculine role.  No thanks.But, although it's hard to take a multi-millionaire egoist telling us to reevaluate our values, Tom Cruise is amazingly good, giving a depth of performance so rare in today's mainstream cinema, awesomely self-aware, revelling in the blurring of star and role.",Jerry Maguire
82,FlickJunkie-2,Highly Entertaining,9,15 September 2000,"Tom Cruise had a good year in 1996 showing everyone the money by starring in two of the top four grossing films of the year (""Jerry Maguire"", $153M; and ""Mission: Impossible"", $180M).  Of the two, ""Jerry Maguire"" was clearly the better film, garnering five Oscar nominations and winning a best supporting Oscar for Cuba Gooding, Jr.It is the story of a sports agent who falls from grace with his agency because he develops scruples and has the bad judgment to share his newfound principles with his firm.  This results in instant unemployment and the necessity to start his own agency.  Upon striking out with his trusty new assistant Dorothy (Renee Zellweger), he finds to his chagrin that the only client that stays with him is a loudmouth of a football player named Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding, Jr.) whose psyche is in a state of delicate imbalance.  As time goes on and his depression and debt get deeper, Jerry's only hope is that Rod can play football as well as he can talk trash.Writer/Director Cameron Crowe is excellent at writing amusing human-interest stories with offbeat themes (See Fast Times At Ridgemont High).  The combination of the high-pressure world of sports representation, a whacked-out client and a charming love affair makes for an engaging tale with something for just about everyone.Tom Cruise shines as Jerry Maguire.  He gives that character a false bravado that belies his desperate lack of confidence.  Yet, despite his feelings of hopelessness he never gives up, not on Rod, Dorothy or himself.  This film put Renee Zellweger on the map as Dorothy, Jerry's idealistic and loyal secretary and love interest.  She was enchanting and resolute as she stood by her man no matter what the costs.  Cuba Gooding, Jr. was fantastic and stole the show repeatedly with his over the top performance.This is a fast paced and highly entertaining film.  I rated it a 9/10.  I recommend it highly.",Jerry Maguire
83,mfellipecampos,Nice,6,22 August 2021,"Jerry Maguire is that usual nonsense in American cinema about sports and overcoming lessons, with the advantage of being able not to irritate. On the contrary, he manages to amuse, thrill. Tom Cruise is an extremely charismatic actor. Even playing anti-heroes or any other kind of incorrect character, he needs little more than a couple of scenes to bring the audience to his side. It's true that since he took over Scientology for good and jumped on Oprah's couch, his popularity has dwindled. But even so, the actor is still a reference in this regard (charisma, not box office failure...). All of this is evident in Jerry Maguire. The film, another great work by director/screenwriter Cameron Crowe, tells the story of the title character, a highly successful and unscrupulous sports agent who, in the midst of a crisis of conscience, writes a memo, or rather, a ""planning goals"", defending a reduction in the number of customers and a closer relationship with them. That athletes are treated more humanely, even if it means less profit for the agents. The result is certain: Maguire is fired from the company he works for and loses all his clients. Your personal and professional life goes from heaven to hell in a few days. The only things he has left are a fish, accountant and single mother Dorothy Boyd (Renée Zellweger) and decadent gambler Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr., in her best film portrayal), the only client who trusted him. Jerry Maguire's transformation (from characterless agent to hero) is very well portrayed by Cameron Crowe, who knows how to mix drama and comedy without falling into the caricature. But despite being well written (the screenplay was nominated for an Oscar) and directed, the film would not work without the charisma of Cruise, who wins the audience from the first scene. The actor, nominated for an Academy Award for this role, is well at ease, displaying talent in both comedic and dramatic scenes.Film viewed on the 21st to the 22nd of August 2021.",Jerry Maguire
84,RossRivero99,A very good movie on so many levels,9,3 July 2015,"Cameron Crowe's Jerry Maguire is the first and the best sports-agent movies that I have ever seen before and it is a film that also knows a lot about TV sports-casting as well. The movie stars Tom Cruise as Maguire one of the top sports agents that works for a company called SMI and goes by the philosophy that ""being a sports agent isn't about how much money you get and how many clients you may have it is about the friendship with your clients"" and gets fired as a result after his boss Bob Sugar (played by Jay Mohr), and before he leaves he decides to go establish a new business with a co-worker named Dorothy Boyd (played by Renee Zellweger) who is the only person that believes in Jerry, and his only client Rod Tidwell (played by Cuba Gooding Jr. in an Oscar winning performance) who acts like a brother to him, and as a result for Tom Cruise he goat a best actor Oscar nomination for his work. Crowe's screenplay is also well written and inspires many to follow their dreams whether you want to be involved in the sports business or not.Even though this isn't a great movie I did enjoy watching the movie. There are some other good things about the movie as well mainly being the humor of this movie which is funny in a goofy kind of way. This is a movie that I think many movie lovers should enjoy laugh with, and treasure as much as I did.",Jerry Maguire
85,cardsrock,Still holds up,8,13 March 2020,"Cameron Crowe's film about the redemption of a cynical sports agent is still able to strike the right notes as a viewer today. The evolution of the characters over the film is the most enduring and notable quality about this film. Cruise, Gooding Jr., and Zellweger are a strong trio leading the film and mostly nail their dramatic moments. It can get a bit cheesy, but for the most part, the drama still holds up.",Jerry Maguire
86,LebowskiT1000,"Very Touching, Very Funny, Very Good Film",9,27 August 2002,"I have to admit that the first time I saw this film, I wasn't too terribly impressed.  I'm not really sure why, cause I've seen it quite a many times since then and I've loved it every time since.  There are so many good things about this film, that you really ought to see this film.  The acting is great, the characters are great, the story is interesting, the film is beautifully directed, the comedy is hilarious, everything is excellent in this film.All the cast members deserve a great deal of respect for their roles.  Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr. are absolutely fantastic throughout the film! Rene Zellweger, Bonnie Hunt, Regina King, Kelly Preston, Jerry O'Connell, Jay Mohr, Todd Louiso, Jonathan Lipnicki and Beau Bridges all did a great job as well, and I really liked all of their characters a great deal. Needless to say, the acting is top-notch.The comedy in this film is something I really think I ought to mention.  The comedy is so well done throughout the film, there are a number of times where I found myself just cracking up.  Usually it was just the way something was said, or who was saying it.  The humor is most-definitely NOT any type of graphical humor, you aren't going to see any slapstick or gross-out humor in this film, so if that's what you're looking for you might want to look elsewhere.Well, I really think you should do yourself a favor and see this film! Although, be fore-warned, this is a romantic/comedy/drama, so brace yourself.  It's really good though!  Anyhow, I really hope that you do see this film, and hope you enjoy it.  Thanks for reading,-Chris",Jerry Maguire
87,OriginalMovieBuff21,"A Great film, Tom Cruises best performance yet",9,16 May 2004,"Jerry Maguire is an excellent kind of film that teaches you a lesson in life. I'll tell you what, Cuba Gooding Jr. by far had the best performance. He was hilarious in this movie and I loved how he bragged all the time. Years, I have always dreamed of being a sports agent. By the time, I saw this movie, I loved it. Oh and did I forget, Tom Cruise was also incredible in this movie as you know Jerry Maguire. He had a lovely performance, maybe his best performance yet. Renee Zelwegger was also great in it and was really pretty. Now, I don't really think she is that pretty anymore. I also don't like her anymore either. But oh well, this was an oustanding movie and you can learn something while watching it.9/10",Jerry Maguire

89,christophe92300,Boring love story = true nature of the movie,3,29 December 2013,"You expect a punchy, cynical movie about sports and a behind the scenes look at a sports agent job through Jerry Maguire, and ultimately you end up enduring an extremely conventional and corny rom-com.This love story occupies a huge place in the script and you wonder why because it is boring to death and so melodramatic that it becomes cringe-worthy.The part related to sports is almost anecdotal, overshadowed by this boring love plot, and it's quite difficult to understand why Cameron Crowe didn't chose to focus on football since it augured good things especially thanks to Rod, the exuberant Cardinals wide receiver, embodied by the excellent Cuba Gooding Jr., only satisfaction of this insipid and overly long movie.",Jerry Maguire
90,SKG-2,Cameron Crowe does it again,10,4 April 1999,"Cameron Crowe is one of my favorite filmmakers after only three films to his credit as director (he also wrote FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH, which was a little rough around the edges but still good, and THE WILD LIFE, which was a huge mistake).  SAY ANYTHING and SINGLES were classics, and now comes JERRY MAGUIRE, which is the first time he's made a film about people his age or around that.  It manages to avoid being cynical and at the same time avoid being saccharine in its tale of a sports agent named Jerry Maguire who, thanks to a memo(or mission statement) that came from a brief bout of conscience, loses his job and his fiancee, and must not only claw himself back but admit to himself that he did in fact write that memo and really does believe in it.Tom Cruise has spent half of his career coasting, and half of it giving great performances when he works with a real director.  This fits in the latter category.  As the script shows Jerry's growth in small steps, so does Cruise.  It's not until he really has grown and has something to lose (his marriage) that he has a big emotional scene at the end, and this feels earned, rather than cheap, as it does in so many other movies.  And while he is the star here, Cruise doesn't horn in on everyone else, but really plays off of everyone else, and even allows them room to steal the movie.As for the rest, a lot has been said about Cuba Gooding Jr., and among the people who were nominated for Best Supporting Actor, he would get my vote. He also felt honest and was funny and energetic.  And the rest of the cast is good as well.  But the real force, for me, anyway, came from Renee Zellweger.  I think it was Gene Siskel who said he felt the movie might have started out being more about sports, but when Zellweger was cast, it was shifted towards her character more simply because she lights up the screen. Now, from what I've read, I don't think the movie was edited towards her, but she certainly does light up the screen.  She has the two best moments of the movie; when she finds out Jerry's dumped his fiancee, the look on her face is incredible, and I also loved her line to Jerry after his big speech near the end, ""You had me at hello.""  A great moment in a great movie.",Jerry Maguire
91,Idocamstuf,"Overrated, self indulgent and offensive",3,27 March 2003,"Man, why does everybody like this movie?  I thought it was terrible.  Tom Cruise was as irritating as ever, so was Cuba Gooding(who somehow managed to snag an oscar). Not only was it irritating, it was offensive, having to hear the f-word all of the time for no reason whatsoever, Tom Cruise having sex with Kelly Preston in several scenes, which would have been better if they didnt film them like a porno.  Self indulgent characters and annoying diologue destroy this one completely. *1/2 out of *****.",Jerry Maguire
92,AvidClimber,Jerry Maguire — Watch it for the romance and be entertained by the antics,7,3 May 2013,"Jerry Maguire is now pop culture reference material. ""You had me at Hello"" and ""You complete me"" are some of the most commonly quoted movie phrase in North America. Underneath that is a romance born of unusual circumstances.The good. Very interesting story with a unique setup. Well paced scenario. Excellent character psychology and interactions.The actors. Tom Cruise goes all out, but his best scenes are the ones where he's calm. Cuba Gooding Jr. is just spot on as the self-centered athlete. And Renée Zellweger is at her cutest and most vulnerable as the lost single mother.The bad. Acting exaggerations on the part of Cruise and Gooding. It's probably what made it popular in the first place, but watching it now, for the third time, it's unnerving. Also, the kid might have been cute the first time you see the flick, but he's really not a good child actor.The ugly. Quarterback Troy Aikman shows once again that professional athlete can't act to save their lives. It's a good thing he's got only two lines.The result.

93,lagudafuad,Show me the money!!!,8,3 September 2012,"A desperate man trying to make it on its own, a love story waiting to happen, movie lines that have stood the test of time and add an egotistic maniac, Cameron Crowe has a masterpiece waiting to explode on your TV screens if you have not been fortunate enough to have seen Jerry Maguire already.Written, produced and directed by Cameron Crowe, Jerry Maguire was received with a number of accolades, one being Best Supporting Actor for Cuba Gooding Jr. in the Academy awards, Chicago Film critics association, Screen Actors Guild and Satellite Awards.The movie launched Renée Zellweger into the limelight and it is one of the best written movies I have ever seen. Jerry Maguire spawned several popular quotations, including ""Show me the money!"", ""You complete me"", ""Help me help you"", and ""You had me at 'hello'"". These lines are largely attributed to Cameron Crowe.The great thing about Jerry Maguire will be unique to each viewer, is it the trust bond between Jerry (Tom Cruise) and Rod (Cuba Gooding Jr.) or the love between Rod and Marcee (Regina King) or the romantic story between Jerry and Dorothy (Renée Zellweger). Whatever it is that you like, the movie is full of it.The plot, Jerry is a sports agent who developed a moral epiphany one night; he decided to write it all down. Still in the drive he went ahead printed it and sent it to all members of his staff. He got fired for expressing it; he decides to put his philosophy to the test as an independent.He tried all his best to keep his clients but only one stayed with him, Rod Tidwell an ego maniac, it all seems rosy at first and then it all went downhill for Jerry.He then realized what mattered most in life.Before Jerry Maguire Cuba was known for his movie Boyz n the Hood where he played Tre, he also was in a few good men with Tom Cruise. Cruise however was coming from a breakthrough role in his movie Mission Impossible, to star in this one.After Jerry both actors have grown to be a well-known name in the movie industry with Tom sticking to the high rollers and Cuba staying with direct to DVD releases from 2009 – 2011.This movie is a most see, so don't chicken out go see it.",Jerry Maguire
94,TaylorYee94,Heart warming movie. Renee Zellweger is so attractive in this movie.,6,16 May 2019,"I finally watched this movie because people talk about this particular line ""You had me at hello."" It all started from this one quote. First, the screenwriter must have done a good job because he or she left this remarkable and timeless one line. The rest of the story line may seem simple and bland, but the writer manages to absorb the audience till the end without uproar.
Second, many characters possess charm. Jerry, an ambitious sports manager, come to realize the importance of love and the way to express it. We all love this kind of story, right? Dorothy, a pure-at-heart but strong single mom and Ray (Gosh, he is so adorable in this movie.) who is the prototype of cuteness make this move upbeat and warm at the same time.
There are some drawbacks as well.
First, the narrative is too simple. Even though it doesn't feel too simple with charms of characters and good lines, how Jerry come to realization is a little bit abrupt.
Second, Tom Cruise's acting is too much. When I see him act, I can tell him he's acting. A whole facial expression, tone, and how he says the line overall say ""Here I go, I am acting right now. See! I'm serious.""It may be personal opinion because I think great acting makes me see the character not the actor.",Jerry Maguire

This, however, is another well done creation from Mr. Crowe.Tom Cruise stars as Jerry Maguire, a sports agent. All of a sudden his perfect life completely comes tumbling down. Throughout the movie Maguire embarks a love interest with one of his new clients, played by Renee Zellwegger. Then along the way he also manages to continue managing his prospect, Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.) to the top.So really just check this one out if your looking for a Dramatic Romance story with some slight comedic material.

98,HelenMary,a good sports agent movie with some schmaltz,6,15 January 2013,"I like Tom Cruise, he plays Tom Cruise really well, and this is no different. Jerry Maguire is a Sports Agent who after an epiphany of conscience sets up on his own. That's when Renee Zellweger brings the unlikely into the plot. Everything apart from Jerry's relationship with Dorothy in this film is plausible. Bonnie Hunt (always a good bet) plays the sensible sister whom Dorothy could listen to once in a while. Sure it plays out in true Hollywood fashion - yay - but I get angry at characters like Dorothy Boyd, annoying and silly. Tom is great, Jay Mohr (Sugar, the rival agent) plays sleaze so well, Cuba Gooding Jnr's flamboyant extrovert over-the-top manic is perfect for his role as Rod Tidwell and he really brings some crazy sanity to the other side of the plot which is the schmaltz of Jerry and Dorothy and corny dialogue. His relationship with Jerry is heartwarming, and the bromance between them is the real love interest of the film. Regina King is great as Mrs Tidwell, although I've only seen her play similar roles.Jerry Maquire is rightly hailed as a modern classic film, and whilst I find the romance between Dorothy and Jerry a little ridiculous and far-fetched, it does make it appeal to a wider audience that would other wise be only sports fans. It makes the film cover more genres, makes it different to other sports-films by giving it a number of story threads. Whilst it is predictable and has a very Hollywood ending, you don't really mind as it rounds the package of this film off nicely and it wouldn't have worked so well any other way. Special mention in this film has to go to little Jonathan Lipnicki who plays Dorothy (Renee's) son Ray; he's as cute as a button and adds some rather natural acting for one so young (age 5) as the child who melts Jerry a little bit. Overall, a great movie you can watch over and over, and one of Tom's best roles.",Jerry Maguire

But not just Cruise, other great cast members including Renee Zellweger, Regina King, Bonnie Hunt, Kelly Preston, and the hilarious Cuba Gooding, Jr. were all brilliant and unique. To me, the movie felt more like a movie about one's feelings and every-day life, and Cameron Crowe does a magnificent job taking this life lesson, and putting it on the big screen.

Unfortunately the dialogue of modern films is increasingly filled with language that would have been totally unacceptable anywhere but in a men only bar or the locker room.At the risk of sounding like someone's maiden aunt, I find this language unnecessary and offensive - especially when it is coming out of the mouths of children.

Tom Cruise gives perhaps his finest ever performance in this above average ROM-COM. The central message---love conquers all---is delivered gently with some deft writing. Maguire, caught up in the cynical world of sports agents decides that ""heart and honesty"" is the way to go. Its a brave decision and only Dorothy Boyd (Rene Zellwegger) believes in him and his new philosophy. It threatens to become cheesy as their relationship develops----but this film is better than most and it never dips into ""Yucky"" territory.

Especially with Dorothy's son, played charmingly by Jonathan Lipnicki, but in some of the bigger scenes his performance is so wrong-headed you can't imagine what he was thinking. The character for me was completely unlikable and irritating. The film itself It's a meandering and deeply shallow tale of spiritual redemption, built around the Teflon persona of Tom Cruise and driven by the conviction that all emotions worth expressing can be summed up in pop songs. Everything about Jerry, about Dorothy, about her unbearably cute son and her unbearably overbearing sister, is unconvincing, overbearing and formulaic.This is the second critically acclaimed Cruise movie I've not liked, the first being Vanilla Sky.

109,wnterstar,"good, but I was expecting more",7,5 April 2006,"I'm not really sure why I didn't love for this movie. It has everything a good movie needs: a great cast, a solid script, good cinematography, and a moving score. And maybe that's what's wrong with it. It tries too hard to be a great movie. It seems forced at times.Having said that, I did enjoy the movie and I would even see it again. It's filled with memorable quotes and classic scenes. I mean, who will ever forget Jerry telling Dorothy ""You complete me!"" or Jerry yelling ""Show me the Money"" over and over again. These quotes, along with others, have become so well known, that they have been satirized in sitcoms and movies.I can only give this a 7 out of 10, but that's still not bad!",Jerry Maguire
110,monkeysgalore,"A Fell Good Movie That's Undeniably Fun, But Not as Profound or Clever as it Thinks it is",8,11 April 2020,"Two good leads, Cuba Gooding Jr. yelling, and a freaking adorable little kid make this a super fun feel-good movie that is worth your time.Tom Cruise is great as usual, and turns his charm up to 11, Renee Zellweger is good, and Cuba Gooding Jr. is great. This is a pretty excellent cast, and the movie basically coasts on the charm of its actors.I can appreciate the premise and the movie's message; personal connections, but I don't think it ever really embraced what it had to say. Jerry has this epiphany early in the film and changes his life, but it never seemed like he really did what he was promoting, which is value people, though I guess he did with Cuba. The romance with Zellweger is cute and charming, sure, but I'd you think about it, he was terrible to her and didn't respect her at all really.Also, yes the living room scene near the end was moving and great, but think about what changed between Cruise and Zellweger towards the end. Literally nothing. Cruise just had a great night, and channeled his circumstantial happiness into a failing relationship to somehow save it.So yes the movie is certainly well-done and charming and hilarious and very quotable, but it's not my favorite romantic dramedy and it's message seemed muddled. It is a classic though, so it's worth at least one watch, especially for Cruise or Gooding Jr. fans.",Jerry Maguire
111,manendra-lodhi,Well good film but the same American typo which did not have enough exciting moments.,6,24 June 2012,"The film is of the same type as many films. This is a good film but there have been so many like this and to me it did not offer anything new. I know this was nicely acted and crisply directed one, but maybe there was too much uncertainty every time. I still could not get the theme of the film. To me in the starting it seemed to be a struggle story and then diverted to romance. And frankly I think they might not have handled any one of them properly. Tom cruise shows superb acting in this one also. If they would have shown either of the struggle or romance maybe it would have been better.""Watch at your own risk.""",Jerry Maguire
112,j-lacerra,"What's it all about, Jerry?",6,16 June 2010,"Jerry Maguire is a movie about a sports agent who tries to go it alone by injecting heart into his relationship with his clients. To do this he needs fewer clients. His employer complies by firing him for his 'subversive' ideas. The title character, played by Tom Cruise, is not the most sympathetic of guys, and Cruise does not seem to know how to play him. He alternates from sentimental calm to over the top wild.Cruise's remaining client, a footballer played by Cuba Gooding, Jr., is an unlikeable and also over the top character. Gooding, Jr. plays him as a greed-driven, wild and noisy moron-jock. Gooding, Jr. is actually quite repulsive here, extremely annoying when on the screen (Oscar for what?).I am not a football fan (don't even understand it), so the scenes of the game were no boost for me. I do know enough to notice that Gooding, Jr. seems way too small to play a pro. It is hard to understand what this story is about, and the movie does nothing to clue us in. I found Jerry Maguire to be marginally entertaining, mostly due to Renee Zellweger and a host of cameos by the likes of Beau Bridges, Eric Stoltz, etc. JM is worth a look on a rainy Sunday afternoon when there is nothing better available and no game on.",Jerry Maguire
113,robsta23,Very Easy to Watch,9,6 February 2016,"Jerry Maguire is not a perfect movie in the sense that it is a masterpiece, but it seems difficult to dislike this movie. Despite being rated R for some swearing and sexual content, this movie deals with the notion of family and is definitely easy enough for a child to watch. It is very entertaining while it is simultaneously a touching story about relationships and their importance in our lives.More than anything, Jerry Maguire is a film with heart. It can be argued that it has two protagonists: Jerry and Rod (played by Cuba Gooding Jr.) and both seem to need to learn about love. Jerry needs to connect to people, specifically to those who he claims to love, and Cuba needs to learn to play his sport with love and not just for the money. It is brilliant in the sense that Maguire's story and Rod's story are intertwined since the two depend on each other. Maguire is all about making relationships with clients more personal while Rod is all about wanting Jerry to pay attention to his needs. One is the professional, the other is the greedy showboat. Ultimately, they both depend on each other since Rod is Jerry's last client and since Jerry might be the only agent willing to put up with Rod's ego.The film is well-acted, especially by Cuba Gooding Jr., and we like each character for different reasons. The kids in this film are adorable, especially Ray, Dorothy's son, who proves to be funny even though we know he is the reason Jerry wants to get together with Dorothy.Half a sports film and half a romance, Jerry Maguire proves to be fun for a variety of people.3.5/4.0",Jerry Maguire
114,Siamois,Probably deserves its classic status...,5,12 October 2009,"Watching Jerry Maguire again recently, I can understand its status as a (cult) classic of the 90s but the movie did not have such a strong effect on me. We follow Jerry Maguire on his transformation from cynical, go-getter player agent to a less materialistic, better grounded person. Here's the first reason I had problems getting immersed: we only get but a glimpse of his former, superficial life and jump right into the ""epiphany"" portion where he longs for change. From a dramatic point of view, it makes the character's transition less lifelike and we lose the impact of such a transformation. Not to mention all the comedy moment we probably miss out (cynical characters lend themselves well to comedy and good setups that can be exploited later on).As much as the central figure is Jerry Maguire, two other characters go through transformations themselves: Dorothy Boyd is Maguire's love interest. A young single mother in a precarious situation (fringe job, living with her sister and longing for partner to complete her family). Rod Tidwell is the typical feisty but underrated player at a critical juncture of his short football career, looking for a big payoff in his next (and likely last) contract.Tom Cruise is excellent in a role that fits him like a glove. He is right in his comfort zone in this role which makes it easy effortless to become Jerry Maguire. As much as sometimes we find him clueless and want to punch him, we greatly enjoy the ride. Renée Zellweger was probably put on the bigger Hollywood map thanks to her role as Dorothy Boyd. Zellweger, much like Cruise, is perfectly cast here. These roles as quirky, vulnerable, romantic interest are almost a speciality for her (think Bridget Jones, Me Myself and Irene, Nurse Betty) and she is immediately endearing and she makes people around her shine in scenes. A good actress with a good feel for chemistry and synergy. And lastly is Cuba Gooding Jr. as the sometimes hilarious, sometimes obnoxious Rod Tidwell. Gooding sometimes overreaches to the point where the character is nothing more than a caricature, and none of it is as well done as, say, the various weird, over-the-top characters that populate The Big Lebowski, for instance. The famous ""show me the money scene"" probably deserves its cult status but loses a lot of impact the second time around. You wish the script was a little tighter in some places, that more context was provided. The mix of drama and comedy often feels a bit awkward. The peripheral characters are lacking. Particularly Dorothy's kid, Ray... who ends up annoying most viewers and is not endearing at all. Dorothy's sister and Tidwell's wife (both acting as catalysts to push Dorothy and Tidwell to bigger and better things) are also equally annoying. The direction is unremarkable. The cinematography is sub par. Every memorable scenes (there are few) is driven by acting and a lot of the quotes sound rather cheesy and corny for a movie from the 90s. ""You had me at hello"" is what one might expect from a 50s movie, not the 90s. But through it all, Cameron Crowe manages to never sink completely into happy-happy Hollywood crapola, making Maguire a flawed and somewhat believable character. If only the lines had been refined. The writing is too self-conscious at times and the movie doesn't expand enough on the ""old Maguire"" to make the journey he takes truly remarkable. It's still a good movie and deserves at least one viewing. Especially worth it for the great chemistry between the three actors, a very strong and engaging premise and some memorable scenes.I can totally see why it's a classic but it just didn't do it for me enough to buy a DVD.",Jerry Maguire

Cruise plays confidence so brilliantly and naturally. After being fired the agent tries to rebuild his career with just one client and an assistant (Renee Zellweger).

That's neither due to particularly outstanding cinematic qualities, nor to over-the-top acting (although Cuba Gooding Jr. really deserved his Oscar). Nevertheless it's one of my favourites. Credit goes to Cameron Crowe. I will compare it with ""Almost Famous"", the other great film of him. I think from an ""objective"" point of view, both films are equally good, but the story and characters of ""Jerry Maguire"" are much closer to my heart. I really feel I can identify with them, and that is the difference. I absolutely get this character, like I don't get many. I understand his wish to do something important and right with your life, I know this problem with ""good at friendship, bad at intimate relationships"", I share a positive view but also know that we live in a mostly cynical world. I also know what critics of the film say and in some way I do agree in many points they state, and maybe they are right. But I just love this film, I can't help.",Jerry Maguire
117,cosmorados,The key to this business is personal relationships.,8,2 February 2009,"Jerry Maguire is a sports agent at the top of his game working for Sports Management International. They handle the lives of hundreds of athletes and negotiate the big bucks deals that get them everything they want. However, after a bad TV dinner in a hotel room, Jerry realises that this molly-coddling, not-telling-them-like-it approach, that the agents industry has put out their over such a long time might not be what's best for his clients, and decides to speak his mind with disastrous consequences. Armed with only one client who would stick with him, and the one assistant from his old firm who would stick by him, with the help of her ever-so-cute son, Jerry has to re-build his shattered life and reputation from scratch.The most apt description ever of this film is that it is a chick-flick for guys. Everything about this film screams chick flick, but because men folk are thick, because it has sports in it, we think it's for us. We're easily fooled! This for me was Tom Cruise's big breakthrough film, far from the confident, cocky, brash Tom Cruise we had seen before here was a different side, a human side, and it is his portrayal of Jerry, a man brought to his knees by an industry that doesn't care, that really sucks us in. You know that in spite of all the things that get thrown at him, he is a good person, and while he may have approached things the wrong way, his heart's in the right place, and it is inspired casting by Cameron Crowe and his team to get Tom in this role.The rest of the cast fill out their rolls superbly well, and Renee Zellwegger, Bonnie Hunt, Jay Mohr and Jonathan Lipnicki (Apologies for spelling folks) all are great in the rolls as assistant, assistant's sister, rival agent and assistant's son. However the big turn on the film other than Tom is Cuba Gooding Jnr as the under-rated Rod Tidwell, whose un-noticed form helps carry his team to greater things. So convincing is his portrayal, by the time you're midway through it you almost feel like your watching some fly on the wall documentary.The direction in this film is superb and this, along with ""Say Anything"" are arguably his best work. The script is one of the best I've seen out on the big screen and itnever lets you settle in you seat. But in spite of all the ups and downs of Jerry and the motley crew that gather round him of course this is a feel good film, and if you're not humming ""Shelter from the storm"" a few minutes after watching this film then you can show me the money.Nuff said.",Jerry Maguire

122,goolizap,Twizard Rating: 100,10,12 January 2017,"I love movies that can't necessarily be classified by a single genre. Jerry Maguire isn't a chick flick, but it's not a sports film either. Nor is it a traditional comedy. It's possibly all three, but never just one. That's what makes it great. It appeals to both genders equally without alienating either of them.The title character is played by Tom Cruise in one of his best performances. He's a slimy sports agent who, one day, has an epiphany, realizing he no longer wants to sell lies to his clients, but real relationships. The only problem is he doesn't even know how to have a real relationship in his personal life. At work, he sends out a mission statement that lauds the idea of having less clients to improve quality. This sudden life-changing notion wins over the approval of his cohorts, but his high-level agency disapproves and fires him.Starting from the ground up, Jerry has nothing and no one to work with. The only people that follow him are a low-level employee, Dorothy (Renee Zellweger) and Arizona Cardinals wide receiver, Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding, Jr.).The chemistry between Cruise and both of his costars is natural that you can't imagine anyone else in those roles. You see him seamlessly transform over the course of the film, only taking notice of it in the end. Honestly, it's very much reminiscent of Pacino in the Godfather--only backwards.Jerry Maguire equally covers the depth of multiple characters brilliantly. The film not only goes inside the mind of a scuzzbag-turned-nice-guy, but of an athlete. Gooding plays a talented football player with a chip on his shoulder. He's not on his way out of the league, but he's no Jerry Rice either. He's on a middling NFL team and thinks he deserves a bigger paycheck than he gets. He knows he's good, but no one else sees it. The film brings very relatable themes to seemingly unrelatable people. There is more to the movie than demand for money. It's about friendship and knowing what's important in life amidst all the menagerie.Writer-director Cameron Crowe has a knack for storytelling--already evident by his previous work--but he outdoes himself with this one. Nothing is ever truly predictable, which is an impressive accomplishment considering the type of film. Never is there a dull moment, and the dialogue is so effortlessly perfect without ever feeling contrived. The sappy moments are never that, when any other writer would know no other way. It's a rom-com for the ages and may even be the pinpoint for redefining the genre.It has aged so well and is still a great watch to this day. Highly recommended for those of you who haven't seen it and are arguing with your other half about what to watch on movie night. I promise you'll both enjoy it.Twizard Rating: 100",Jerry Maguire

Maybe even more! As I already said in the title of my review, only Cameron Crowe can make this kind of movies. Movies about life the way it is and life the way it should be. What I like the most about Crowe's work, is that everything is real. The characters, their emotions, the story, The whole is absolutely amazing.Tom Cruise gave an excellent performance as the sports agent with a heart. Someone for who money isn't the most important thing. It's all about the relationship between the sports agent and his client. What's so great about ""Jerry Maguire"", is the fact that the movie isn't about who Jerry Maguire really is, it's about who he wants to be. I loved Cuba Gooding Jr. By far his greatest role ever. Let's not forget Renée Zellweger and her cute son, amazingly performed by the young Jonathan Lipnicki. Both where very good. Perfect casting for Zellweger.I read in the trivia that the title role was written for Tom Hanks. Don't get me wrong, Tom Hanks is an excellent actor, but to play an ambitious and arrogant sports manager (what Jerry Maguire was at the beginning of the movie), you need to have Tom Cruise's face. He was just perfect for the role. I can't think of anybody who could have done this as good as he did.So my conclusion for Jerry Maguire: If you haven't seen it, you should definitely see it. If you have seen it, I hope you can agree with me. This movie is wonderful, as where are used from Cameron Crowe-movies.9/10",Jerry Maguire

It was a different feeling seeing Cuba and Tom having tears in their eyes, specially Tom. For the first time I really saw an emotional performance from Cruise without his sometimes over the top charm.

126,toll-8,An average film made better with strong performances,6,3 May 2012,"Jerry Maguire was released a good few years ago and, despite knowing a few of the quotes from the film, I had never seen it. I knew it was Tom Cruise as the sport's agent Jerry Maguire, but never really knew the ins and outs of it. I was quite surprised to find out it has a good hint of comedy in it, and isn't as sporty as I thought it was. I was shocked when I sat down to watch this.The film begins showing Maguire as a hot shot agent, who represents many top sport stars across the country. One night however he has an epiphany and writes a 'mission statement' about how his agency should worry about the cliental instead of the money. He posts this 25 page mission statement in everybody at the company's pigeon hole and is greeted at work the next day with a huge round of applause. The big bosses of the company though don't agree with his document and instantly fire him, to be fair why would a company earning millions want to stop earning millions? After being fired he heads off to set up his own business, but first tries to persuade his current sport stars to come with him. They all choose to stay with their current representation, apart from one who is willing to still use Mr Maguire as his agent, Rod Tidwell (Gooding Jr). Maguire's company consists of himself and, an assistant who followed him from his former job, Dorothy (Zellweger). The company gets off to a bad start when the biggest football star in the country drops him and goes with Maguire's former company, leaving Maguire to put all his worth into Tidwell, who is an egotistical footballer with a severe attitude problem. As the film goes on Maguire and Dorothy begin to fall for one another, and Tidwell becomes more of a friend than a client. Maguire and Tidwell, who both have different views on life, manage to teach each other subconsciously how to be the men that will make their career flourish. It isn't really a film about sport, it is more about the relationship people have, and especially since it is stated, Maguire struggling to be alone but lacking intimacy with anyone he is close to. The themes are deep, much deeper than a typical sports movie.The script for the film is very good. The characters are so well drawn, and each one manages to bring something to the forefront, all to aid in Jerry Maguire's development as a person. The character of Tidwell is a great character and he is so pivotal for the outcome of this movie. The characters are also aided by some great acting. Cruise is very good in his role here, and is utterly believable as Maguire. He has the look and the mannerisms of an arrogant sports agent. Tom Hanks was originally slated for the role, but Cruise is definitely the right choice for it. Cuba Gooding Jr. is very good as Tidwell. He is over the top, brash and smitten with his wife. Gooding Jr. brings this character to life so well and thoroughly deserved his Oscar for Supporting Actor that year. Zellweger is also on top form as Dorothy. Her scenes with Cruise are full of emotion, and their chemistry is full of romance, despite one very uncomfortable scene where he kisses her all over on the doorstep. She is clearly in love with Maguire, and Zellweger shows this very well.The film does have a good script and a strong cast but it isn't the best movie out there. The best this movie could possibly be is average. It is an easy watch but the middle sector especially is a little dull. The opening of the film, where we see Maguire have a slight breakdown, is good but it begins to run out of puff towards the end. It is a fairly long film and probably doesn't need to be. The end has a strange climax, and I wander why Tidwell manages to become a bigger star due to him having an injury on the pitch. It was something I just didn't understand. At the end they also announce Tidwell's new contract on the air of a television show, would they do that? Why would people want to hear about it? If anything I would say that would put fans off of him. Here it was pushing the audience to love the football star but why would you be happy for him securing a huge contract. Small issues with this film really bring it down. It isn't a bad film but it also isn't great. The script and the acting are good but there are points that really bring the film down. It is an average film at best, made better by the talent on show. It does have some brilliantly quotable lines, and if you haven't seen this than you will notice which ones I am on about when you watch it. Despite being average I would suggest you watch it, mainly because it is an easy watch and one you won't particularly be disappointed with.3 / 5For more reviews: www.tolli-movieworld.blogspot.com",Jerry Maguire
127,HanShotFirstGR,"""SHOW ME THE MONEYYYYY!"" amount of fun!",8,19 March 2021,"Plot:When a sports agent has a moral epiphany and is fired for expressing it, he decides to put his new philosophy to the test as an independent agent with the only athlete who stays with him and his former colleague.Analysis:Tom Cruise has been accused many times for being an overrated actor, mainly because according to them he can play one particular role, but that's definetely not true. Jerry Maguire is one of the many proofs that Tom Cruise is very good at capturing emotions and delivering solid performances, he does everything right and deserves the recognition. Jerry Maguire might not be a perfect movie, not even one of his best, but it's definetely a very interesting film that leaves you with a nice feeling and gives you some original content.It's a film that doesn't stick to one genre, it swifts between many of them and maintains a pretty good pacing because of that. It's a romantic movie, it's a sports movie, it's a success story, it's a comedy, it's a movie that examines every aspect of Jerry's life and works fine in all of them. The very clever screenplay includes a very casual atmosphere, simple jokes and some very interesting plot lines that capture the viewer's interest and elevate this movie to something worth watching. It's very important to connect with the story of a movie and this one manages to have something for everyone to relate.Cameron Crowe did a great job visually and he seems to have a very nice connection with Tom Cruise. They worked pretty well together in Vanilla Sky a few years later and that proves that they can communicate in a very nice way to produce a memorable result. In Jerry Maguire, Crowe had some questionable moments but in general he really created something very acceptable and enjoyable, not just as a writer, but as a director too. The atmosphere is very comfortable and produces a very pleasant feeling for the audience.Many things have been told about Cruise but this guy is a superstar, it this movie he plays a playboy, a successful business-man, an insecure soul and a man struggling to find meaning, all of them in one character. It's definetely not an easy task and he gets through that pretty smoothly, he is very natural and doesn't have any bad acting moments. But surely, the best performance belongs to Cuba Gooding Jr. who plays the -loyal to Jerry- football player Rod Tidwell. Despite having a very interesting arc as a character, Rod has a very unique style that Gooding understood perfectly and the result is something so natural and smooth that you forget this is acting and not real life. His great work was rewarded with an Academy Award as Best Actor on a Supporting Role. Renée Zellweger had also a major role here and she played the girl-next-door type of character that Dorothy is. Her natural cuteness and awkeard style was exactly what she needed to bring into this role and she performed fine because of that, there wasn't something extraordinary but she was good.In general, this film isn't supposed to make you excited or blow your mind, it's a casual, feel-good film to have a nice evening experiencing a fresh story. Not all movies have to be amazing and I am okay with that. If you go into this movie expecting a nice evening you will be rewarded quite well.Conclusion:It's a movie I had pretty high expectations for and I got a very nice experience. Of course, I won't say it's something someone must definetely watch but it truly is something I would recommend as a more casual choice, it has great acting, it's well-writen and it has no obvious plot holes or mistakes, it's exactly what it was supposed to be and I admire that.Rating: 8/10",Jerry Maguire
128,jaroddfinch,A good Cameron crow movie,7,12 August 2021,The first time that i watch this movie is when I was 14 and I though it was great I'm a big fan of Tom cruise he a really great actor. I like a lot of his movie. And I like Cameron crow movies too. He a really good director so if you like Cameron crow movies you should watch this one it's so good.,Jerry Maguire
129,olddiscs,I Disliked Jerry McGuire Immensely!!!,1,25 March 2006,One of the most over rated over Awarded movies of all time. I didn't walk out because I was with others who were moderately enjoying..No One Loved It..Maybe Cuba Gooding got noticed but didn't deserve that Oscar that Year.& Tom Cruise is one of the most over rated/ over paid film stars ever..OK Passable in Rainman & Born On The 4th Of July but all that other garbage. he's made since including this & Eyes Wide Shut & I cant tell you how much I disliked the War Of The Worlds *(2005 Yuk).. and it bothers me that much better and more attractive actors are struggling in Hollywood & Broadway too.... * please buy or rent the 1953 original with the far superior Gene Barry....and superior production as well,Jerry Maguire
130,jillbeckinheim7,Touching but use of F word not cool,7,19 October 2021,"Touching but use of F word not coolJerry Maquire, a sports agent, who is stupid enough to feel a sense of remorse for seeing the contracts as being the number one prioty and writes an endless Mission statement going on and on about everything wrong with the way things are done, Needless to say he's fired soon afterwords. And needs to start anew, losing his fiancé, and most of his clientèle. The only two that choose to stick by him are a desperately clingy lady just wanted to be loved and a young up & coming conceited black football perspective with a nagging, holier than thou a wife. While Maqurie rise to the occasion and seize what he has left?This movie, while being one of Cameron Crowe's lesser works (basically an over-glorified chick flick) is still pretty good and better than Crowe/Cruise's next collaboration (the remake of ""Vannila Sky) by far. All of the actors acquit themselves as well as can be expected with the over-sentimentalized script. Plus you can't hate a movie with a young kid who says adorable things, that's why that tactic is used way to often in film. Even though it didn't accomplish the suspected job of making one feel good about oneself in the least bit. A woman so emotionally fragile that a guy only need to come see her and tell her 'Hello"" before she crumples on the floor and worships the ground he walks on again? I need to find women like that.",Jerry Maguire

132,Soledad-2,I didn't like it ...,4,28 January 2000,"I saw this movie because I love Tom Cruise (he is one of my favorite actors) and because all my friends at work told me how wonderful this movie was. But I have to admit, I really hate Jerry Maguire.  After watching it two times to figure out its popularity, I came to the conclusion that this is one of the worst movies I have ever watched.  My rating 4/10.",Jerry Maguire
133,CinePendejo,Pretty swell.,8,26 July 2018,"1996 seemed like a weird year at the movies.People could finally laugh at horror movies with SCREAM, American culture's obsession with the end of the world led to INDEPENDENCE DAY and TWISTER's box office success, both FARGO and TRAINSPOTTING caught audiences and critics by surprise, and the whole sector of cinephiles stood together in disgust that a movie like THE ENGLISH PATIENT could win Best Picture.I'm not a sociologist so I'm not sure how that amounts to when defining the cultural zeitgeist of the late 90s. However I will say that if there's any movie that, to me, properly distills what life felt like back then, I'd say it's either JERRY MAGUIRE or FARGO. Since I already saw FARGO, this Scavenger Hunt is dedicated to this instead.Cameron Crowe missteps quite a lot since his heyday as director, but boy did he had a voice. The sensitive, emotionally broken vision he conjures transcends this otherwise melodramatic story into something we can all relate to. Beneath our grin and multi-million dollar facade, we are all still people with emotions and needs. The center of all this is the Space Pope himself Tom Cruise, reverting his TOP GUN swagger into a performance packed with charm and pathos.Whereas FARGO captured the cynical extremes of human choices and how it affects all of us, JERRY MAGUIRE encapsulates a time where we get so fixated on fame and success to mend our lonely lives. And Cameron Crowe reassures us that sometimes, expressing your emotions won't cause the end of the world. Maybe it's okay to settle down and warm up to people once in a while. Even if you're on the hurdle towards your lowest point, all you can depend on is that one person who really cares about you for you.It cannot possibly compare to the extended cut to ALMOST FAMOUS - because almost nothing can - but I was shocked that this still hits in the feels.",Jerry Maguire
134,films-22537,A great romantic-comedy/sports film that couldn't be made today.,10,25 February 2020,"Back in the 1990s a boss having sex with his younger employee was a love story. A female reporter in a men's locker room was used for comedy. A professional athlete playing through multiple concussions for a big contract was heroic. Obviously, none of those things would be accepted in a mainstream studio movie today. However, if a modern viewer gives this movie a chance they'll find it to be a heartwarming tear jerker, with memorable scenes, lines and catchphrases that live on today. To name just a few, ""Show me the money!"" ""I love black people!"" ""Help me, help you."" ""You complete me."" ""You had me at hello."" See Tom Cruise at his best, Cuba Gooding Jr. in his Oscar winning role. The world introduction to director Cameron Crowe and actress Reneé Zellweger. If you haven't seen it I highly recommend you do and if you have I highly recommend seeing it again soon because it's worth a revisit.",Jerry Maguire
135,LeroyBrown-2,"Good script, good acting equals good film.",7,15 February 2009,"""Jerry Maguire"" has to rate as one of the most quotable movies of the last decade and a half. It's given us the lines ""Show me the money"", ""Help me, Help you"", ""You had me at hello"" and ""You complete me"". And it's that last line, that really describe this movie. It's really about the growth of an individual. We see Jerry Maguire the character, grow from just an agent to becoming much more, it's not an easy trip but for the most part it's an entertaining one. Jerry Maguire is a top sport agent. He has a decent amount of big names as client and he's engage to a beautiful woman. Then one day while visiting one of his client in the hospital, the client's young son confronted him after he gives the client a shallow encouragement. The confrontation stick in his mind and would even get him to write a ""mission statement"" for the company. The ""mission statement"" basically lays out a plan that the agents give their clients more personal attention. Unfortunately his boss doesn't like it. The movie gives us a look at the world of the sports agents. Who are they that gets a cut of an athlete's earning and do they really deserve it? In the beginning they're just there to negotiate the numbers and get the athletes as much exposure. In the end, Jerry has become more than a guy who makes deal for an athlete. It also gives us a look at some clients they're more demanding than the agents are prepared to handle. But if handled right they will prove to be worth the trouble.Jerry Maguire is played by Tom Cruise, and he gives one of his best performance. I think it's every bit the equal of Cuba Gooding Jr's. Oscar winning performance. Both men were on top of their game playing off each other. It's sad that his erratic behavior of late has caused harmed to his career because Tom Cruise is a very good actor. So too is Mr. Gooding and Renee Zellwegger, who plays an office worker in Tom Cruise's office and who joined him as he tries to put forth his ""mission statement"" into practice. All in all, I think it's a good movie with a very observant script, complimented by great acting.",Jerry Maguire

137,MyDarkStar,Two different movies...,4,28 November 2001,"This movie basically has two different parts to it : the part at the beginning depicts Jerry Maquire as a low-life sports agent who will do anything to make money with his clients. The second half shows how he puts his life back together through a deep and enlightening relationship, after being fired. The problem is that the earlier part with him being the slimy sports agent is more interesting than the romance ! ...and that's a very big criticism considering the theme of this movie !I would rather see more of Jerry Maguire as that slimy sports agent. That was the entertaining part of the movie (besides Cuba Gooding Jr., who is very entertaining in his role). The romance is just stale here. Also, in my opinion, the kid's appeal wears thin in about, oh, 5 seconds ?Worth seeing once - but not twice.",Jerry Maguire
138,Ryan_9,I loved it!,10,14 May 2020,"Last night I watched ""Jerry Maguire"", and it was such a great and beautiful movie. I loved how it told the story through the point of view of a sports agent rather than a player.Tom Cruise was outstanding in this as he and Renee Zellweger, who played Dorothy, had great chemistry with one another. I also enjoyed Ray (Dorothy's young son) and really liked the relationship he and Jerry developed throughout the movie. Rod Tidwell, played by Cuba Gooding Jr, was another enjoyable character as he was funny and I loved how he never lost faith in Jerry as his agent. The music score was also brilliant.Overall, I'll give ""Jerry Maguire"" a perfect 10/10. I just loved the story and how it was a mixture of genres.",Jerry Maguire
139,concrndone,Confusing message,7,19 September 2021,This is a nice film overall. But the message is confusing. It seems to rail against corporate greed only to settle for a happy ending based only on a large financial sum.The first half had it right as it question what our value is as human beings. Unfortunately the second half doesn't have the courage of its convictions and flat-out confirms that our value is nothing but monetary.For the record I'd like to confirm what this film failed to: that our value as humans lies not in kicking footballs around or making huge amounts of money just for the sake of it so we can live in big houses and elevate ourselves in front of our neighbours but in developing ourselves and breaking new technological boundaries that benefit the next generation and the generations after that. Making the impossible possible. Colonising Mars. Not selling Mars bars.This is a pass the time type film and nothing more. But then what were you expecting?,Jerry Maguire

Also A Great And Funny Performance from Cuba Gooding Jr as Rod Tidwell, who is a very talented Rugby player,but a little careless about it. Also the other supporting cast have done their roles quite well.Cameron Crowe does a great job in making this movie into a quite funny and good movie,helping the cast with their roles, also utilizing a pretty good story.

If the point of being Buffet is to give away your wealth, if the point of being Buddha is to abdicate your throne, if the point of being a man is to go dancing with the wolves (sic), then the point in being in romance is to lose the hero in you that you went finding on your first chase after the skirt!",Jerry Maguire

Cuba Gooding Jnr steals the show with his performance, and Renee Zellweger was fantastic in this role. Jerry Maguire tells the story of a sports agent who is fired from his big corporate job and instead has to forge his own way relying on a single client. It's a movie about believing in others, believing in yourself and about questioning your own morals and beliefs. It's about finding what really makes you happy, and about finding happiness in unexpected places.

When I viewed the voter history for this movie, I couldn't believe the rating it had received after 13,400 registered users had voted. This movie was excellent from the direction to the production sets.  The acting was superb by all but could not and would not have been as great if it had not been for the vision of the director.  I gave this movie a ten because it deserves it everywhere.  The scenes, the sequences, the editing were all great.  Though I'm not involved in the movie industry yet, I try to observe details in a production that make a good, bad, or great movie.  In this case everything fell into place.  The music for certain scenes was perfect.  The characters were extremely believable.  Everyone in the lead and supporting roles deserve an award of some type.  I'm a 49 year old male with two grown kids and two grandchildren but I'm not ashamed to say I was filled with emotion as I watched this film.  I believe a film should consume the viewer- to me that's great filmmaking.  If I can leave my seat or carry on a conversation while watching a film, it's not great- it might be good, but not great.  Jerry Maguire had my undivided attention.  Kudos to everyone involved in the production of this movie.

Zellweger, as the love interest at her absolute finest! forget Bridget: Cuba Gooding Jr in his well deserved Oscar Acadamy award winning role, as the frustrated NFL front man, was impeccable. This is a moral tale tinged with a funny theme to it. Whether in real life uncles Sam, reality would prevail, only the great one himself knows.

153,mr_walsh,"Great, but so close to being classic",8,7 February 2001,"(Spoilers ahoy!) This movie spoke to me as someone entangled in a competitive and cold profession who through only partly his own will finds himself placed right in the face of becoming a human being.Cuba Gooding Jr. steals the show - wonderfully acted.  Zellweger too gave us an outstanding and compelling character.  Cruise too did well but I found one critical flaw.  After Jerry marries Dorothy, we immediately can tell the intimacy isn't there - this Cruise played so well I noticed it before it's really emphasized by the viewing of the wedding video.  But at the end, when he decides he does love Dorothy he doesn't make the switch to truly loving her.  There's just such a mismatch between Zelweger's convincing devotion and Cruise's almost forced plea for her.  In fact, looking back at his scenes with Preston (ex-fiancee) show more electricity.Stylistically, this film has great, swift pacing.  Only thing I noticed: there's just too much music.  It almost becomes a cliche having the scene start with an apropos 70's tune commence shortly afterward.  Personally I like when the actors set the audience's reaction without the music - ala Kubrick.Apart from these minor things, this is a must-see.",Jerry Maguire
154,PeterWilliamson,This Movie Got Me With Hello,8,12 December 2007,"Out of all the romantic comedies made in America, that I've seen, this is by far the best. It surprisingly made me laugh almost through the whole movie. One of Tom Cruise's and Cuba Gooding Jr's best and funniest performances. Definitely worth watching.I'd never seen a Renee Zellweger film until this; and if I hadn't seen this I probably wouldn't of ever watched Bridget Jones's Diary one or two, which turned out to be others which I thoroughly enjoyed.Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a sports talent agent, with some of the biggest clients that anyone has. Until he writes a mission statement.Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zellwegger) is a single mother working at the same office as Jerry. She falls in love with what he writes, a memo.Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.) is a professional footballer, one of Jerry's clients, but not getting enough money or fame for what he is. He wants Jerry to ""SHOW HIM THE MONEY"".Bob Sugar (Jay Mohr) is Jerry's big rival, stealing all his clients. He still doesn't have Rod Tidwell though.Avery Bishop (Kelly Preston) is Jerry's soon to be wife, he's still not sure if she's the right one.Laurel Boyd (Bonnie Hunt) the hilarious sister of Dorothy who, quite clearly, disagrees with her sister and doesn't approve of Jerry.Frank Cushman (Jerry O'Connel) is the best football player their, Jerry's most important client and he just wants to play football. Which ever agent can get him the best deal, he'll stick with.Marcee Tidwell (Regina King) is the aggressive wife of Rod Tidwell and wants the best for her husband, her self and her family.Ray Boyd (Johnathon Lipnicki) is my favourite character and is the famous son of Dorothy Boyd.

155,kate-911-98899,Amazing,10,8 November 2015,"This movie works on so many levels. 7.3 is way too low. When I watch a great movie, one thing I like to think about is how unpredictable the journey is. Most movies, you know who wins, dies, falls in loves, and you can pretty much predict how too if you're good. This was definitely not one of those movies. I mean, when you sat down to watch this movie, you'd never be able to predict this is what you were about to watch. Obviously the acting is fantastic, and that's what everyone talks about. What I think is severely overlooked is how amazing this script is though. First of all, to have a romantic comedy deal with the macho world of sports is brilliant. That it was able to work with both the romance and the agent part was honestly pretty unique. I just felt like every turning point was organic and unifying. Who would think that putting the marriage halfway in the movie would work? 99% of writers would put that at the end, but it works here! Also, what a cool and interesting thing to have the arrogant but up and coming football star be the role model for a good marriage, and what ultimately inspires Maguire to make his marriage to Dorothy work. The scenes were fantastic-the dialog wasn't lame and ""on the nose."" The jokes were hilarious, and obviously the little boy was so perfect and added so much. You could tell Cameron Crowe spent those 3 years writing the script tweaking everything to perfection. That effort paid off. I'm glad this was a hit. Although people might see it as ""commercial"", I think this was an excellent Hero's Journey and airtight screen writing. I was moved and I identified with every character so much. Thank you for such a great movie!",Jerry Maguire

160,sherbetsaucers,Not Just A Chick-Flick,8,6 February 2007,"Once, long ago, before Renée Zellweger was British or Cuba Gooding Jr. was famous, the two of them starred in a movie with Tom Cruise. That movie was called Jerry Maguire.Tom Cruise plays the title role, a part originally written for Tom Hanks. Maguire is a professional sports agent, a self confessed 'Shark in a suit'. Unfortunately for him, one night he develops a conscience, which leads to him typing up a mission statement which contains the rather foolish line 'Fewer clients. Less Money.' This rather unorthodox approach is not appreciated by the company he works for, who promptly fire him. Maguire manages to take with him Dorothy Boyd from accounts (Zellweger), a fish, and one client, the Oscar winning Gooding, who plays a rather annoying American Footballer. He leaves everything else, including his friends, most of his dignity and his fiancée behind, though this last one is no bad thing as Zellweger has admired him from afar for a long time and now is her chance. By the end of the movie Maguire has realised what's important in life, and the audience all know it's going to be alllllll right.Now, I can be as cynical as the next man, unless I'm on a coach full of estate agents, but this movie really gets me. Yes, we know exactly what's going to happen, there are no real surprises, but in a Romance like this the destination isn't the point, the journey is. And what a journey.The first pleasant sight we can see to our left is that Tom Cruise is actually a very good comedy actor. I've never really been a fan of insulting Mr Cruise, and it's movies like this that reassure me that the man can actually do something other than look very pretty. Then of course there is Jonathan Lipnicki as Zellweger's son, Ray Boyd, who at the tender age of 6 manages to steal every scene he is in. It's like someone put the Milky Bar Kid, Shirley Temple and a baby puppy into a blender, hit go, poured the pulp into some kind of child star mold, put it in the freezer for a while to set, then got these big electrodes and attached them. OK, not sure where I'm going with this, but the kid is cute and lovable and not all that bad, OK? Renée Zellweger appears, (well done her). However her sister, played by Bonnie Hunt, actually gets something to do other than make the appropriate face at Tom Cruise (adoring, understanding, mournful and adoring) and so gets a chance to really shine, and believe me she does. This woman should be a bigger star than she is though I get the feeling she may well be more suited to a television format.The real revelation is, of course, Cuba Gooding Jr. His portrayal of Rod Tidwell, which deservedly won him the Best Supporting Actor Oscar, is key to the movie. Despite his 'family motto' being the now famous ""Show Me The Money"", it is Tidwell who shows us that the pursuit of money is not a bad thing, just that it is not the most important thing, which is in essence the message of the whole movie. Further underlining this is the voice of Maguire's old mentor, Dickie Fox, played by an amazingly convincing Jared Jussim (who!?), a character who finally tells us that ""I don't have all the answers. In life, to be honest, I've failed as much as I've succeeded. But I love my wife. I love my life. I wish you my kind of success."" Testify brother Fox, testify.So what Crowe has given us here is a romantic movie where love is indeed the most important thing, but not just love towards the object of your desire, but to everyone around you. It's about reaching out, realising how important other people are, and realising that if you do not love yourself then you really are never going to make it. Oh, and that you should love black people. Apparently.",Jerry Maguire

The only good thing about this movie is the encounter with the little kid .
And could Renee and Tom have less of chemistry between them ..Renee's character was so dumb , it was embarrassing to see how much she tries and how much she's throwing herself over jerry who couldn't give more of a ..... .The whole movie jerry looked like he's broken , he tries so much to fit in but he can't . It was so depressing seeing him falling into pieces , and him trying to gather those pieces with a little bit of hope . He was trying to transition into a certain shape . But he was only making it worse .I have no idea what's the message of this movie . Follow your dreams ? , is it a waking up call ..
this movie was so contradictory, all I've taken from it is never ruin your job with your hands or your life would be ruined forever .Jerry never appreciated this memo he wrote , he knew he had made a mistake , he knew he's fu..cked up even at the end of the movie , And the only reason he was trying is because he knew he has lost this game .It was so hard watching it , Tom looked like he had a headache throughout the whole movie .. and I don't know why he tries so much to please others . He's so unstable . Like bruh .. just go , no one is forcing you to do anything so why are you doing it .Honestly.. throughout the whole movie you would wish jerry never woke up at night and wrote that book , you would wish he never ruined his life .
They tried to make what he did a good thing , but honestly who in the right mind would agree .
Two hours and twenty minutes of nothing , of jerry struggling , I swear to god this movie gave me depression , and the end wasn't that good either , they literally took two hours and twenty iffing minutes to create this Bulls hit .. that isn't funny romantic or sporty , nor inspiring .Please spend your two hours on something else .",Jerry Maguire

It's only when he experiences his first win and is dying to share his happiness with her he realises how truly valuable she is, and feels more confident in himself.

165,ckolet37,Tom Cruise's Greatest Performance,8,7 June 2013,"Jerry Maguire is what it is because it blends everything it has to begin with, with talented writing and phenomenal performances from Tom Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr. This story at first is in a way, a satire of American sports. Everything from NFL drafts to player's wages, the film exploits everything in between at the very beginning. At first, Jerry Maguire is Tom Cruise. Literally, this is the same character that Cruise has played in every film since Risky Business. However, you really get to know the character and feel great sympathy for him. He certainly did not deserve everything to happen to him, and you really get a great sense of his peers as well. Is this really what it is, or more like, is this really how it is? Either way this is the best performance of Tom Cruise's career hands-down. Cuba Gooding Jr is the real star of the show. He deserved his best supporting actor Oscar as much as Cruise deserved his best actor. The two work well off each other, and you really anticipate the next time they are on screen together. The film slowly evolves into a love story, not only between Cruise and Renée Zellweger, but the bond between Cruise and Cuba. This is a film that works, every cheesy but quotable line, every chuckle from Cuba Gooding Jr being an outlandish diva and every time you realize that this is a film that is much deeper than what you may have thought. Go see it.",Jerry Maguire
166,cncsurf,Don't watch for the plot. Or the characters,2,2 January 2018,"I had the unfortunate experience of watching this movie while in a hotel with my girlfriend recently. She LOVES this film for some reason and I gave her the remote and that's what stayed on. I was appalled. There is not one single likeable character. Yes, the actors were OK which is why I gave it 2 stars. But the plot is ludicrous. An unlikable jerk (Tom Cruise) is fired by unlikable jerks (The Company) in a cut throat industry, and rides the coat tails of another unlikable jerk (Cuba Gooding Jr.). After an annoying and obnoxious couple hours trying to make unlikable jerks likeable it turns out the once powerful sports agent is a chump who magically falls in love with a loser single mom and her child. A single mom who has no problem letting a strange man she just started dating cuddle up with her 5 year old boy. wouldn't anyone find this a little creepy??? By the end I was in diabetic shock from the forced ridiculous plot and romance.",Jerry Maguire
167,Kings_Requiem,Real human beings,9,23 March 2015,"Jerry Maguire is a comedic drama starring Tom Cruise, Renee Zellwegger, & Cuba Gooding Jr. among others. The story follows a sports agent named Jerry whose life is inadvertently turned upside down when he decides to write a ""manifesto"" describing how his fellow sports agents really act behind closed doors. And so begins the journey of Jerry Maguire. The acting is uniformly excellent across the board starting with a very down-to-earth performance from Tom Cruise as the title character Jerry. This character isn't necessarily unlike any of his previous characters. He starts out as basically a jerk before evolving into a sweet, caring individual. The thing that I believe sets his character of Jerry apart from the others that he's played, is the fact that he's actually acting like a real human being and not just some random drone that the writer created. He breathes life into Jerry in a way that I'm not sure another actor could have. I'm not the only one who thinks this either - Cruise was nominated for an Academy Award for his performance. Of course, Jerry would not be who he is throughout the movie without the help of his co- worker Dorothy Boyd who is played with a very sweet girl-next-door quality by Renee Zellwegger. I'm usually not a fan of hers, but for the first time in her career she showed me something that was very similar to that of Tom Cruise...she was able to create a fully rounded 100% human being who is very relatable. She's a single mother who carries herself very independently. She's not necessarily supremely confident in her actions, but she's definitely learned throughout the years of raising her son on her own that she doesn't really need anyone in her life except her son. At least that's what she thought. The final member of the cast to really make a lasting impact is Cuba Gooding Jr. who plays Rod Tidwell - a Wide Receiver for the Arizona Cardinals and Jerry's sole remaining client. This is a man who only wants to provide a great living for his family and against all odds he believes that Jerry Maguire is the man who can bring him to that promise land. That belief is heard loud and clear in one of the movies most talked about scenes where Rod and Jerry are on the phone together and Jerry is trying to persuade Rod into keeping him as his agent. Rod: ""It's something very personal, a very important thing. Hell! It's a family motto. Are you ready Jerry? I wanna make sure you're ready, brother. Here it is: Show me the money. Show! Me! The! Money! Jerry, it is such a pleasure to say that! Say it with me one time, Jerry."" Jerry: ""Show you the money."" Rod: ""No, no. You can do better than that! I want you to say it brother with meaning! Hey, I got Bob Sugar on the other line I bet you he can say it!"" Jerry: Yeah, yeah, no, no, no. Show you the money."" Rod: ""No! Not show you! Show me the money!"" This conversation alone shows just how much of a report Jerry and Rod have together and that report is exactly the reason why Rod decides to stick with Jerry as his agent. The conversation also proves that Rod Tidwell is also, just like Jerry and just like Dorothy, a complete 100% human being and it's Cuba Gooding's performance that proves it. He was also nominated for an Academy Award and he won for his performance. The beauty of Jerry Maguire and the thing that makes it so watchable is the fact that it's a very human story with very relatable characters. That's the main thing I look for in a movie...even if it has an extremely predictable story and a predictable outcome - the movie can overcome all of that as long as it has those relatable characters for us to follow along on this journey with. Over the years Jerry Maguire has also kind of taken its place among pop culture lore. Some of its quotes are still used today by several people around the world. That just goes to show how the lasting power of a movie like Jerry Maguire goes a very long way and that's a good way to judge a movies greatness in general years down the line.",Jerry Maguire
168,FordPrefect-42,No one delivers old-school dramady like Crowe,8,31 May 2010,"I finally re-watched this after about ten years, and it's still great after all this time. No one can bring out the emotion and heart out of, what in any other writer director's hands, would have been just another romantic comedy. Crowe's script is funny, warm and thoughtful, and he brings out the best in his cast. Cruise is as charming as ever, and Crowe's script offers a deconstruction of the typical shark character Cruise can play with ease by giving him a wife to not only love, but rely and depend on. Zellweger is charming and really pulls off playing a single mom without feeling too much like a movie star. Gooding Jr's Oscar-winning performance is delightful, but characters like (the perfect) Bonnie Hunt as Zellweger's ""disapproving"" sister or Jay Mohr as a scum-bucket agent bring out the natural charm and joy in Crowe's script and stop Cruise and Zellweger from turning the picture into just another romance.What really sets Jerry Maguire apart however is the focus that a successful marriage depends on both husband and wife giving themselves over to each other completely. What a great message in a world where most big romantic films end just as the real relationship begins.",Jerry Maguire
169,serghei_romanu,Lively film experience,8,22 January 2010,"Jerry Maguire is not a perfect creation, I think no one can objectively affirm that Jerry Maguire is the perfect film experience. However it is what I call an event. If I were to completely analyze this title I'm sure I would find a consistent number of misplaced scenes, scenes which shouldn't have been put, in the first place, and which seriously diminished the depth of the subject.The story is hardly new, same scenario in which an apparently ruined agent spectacular rises and take revenge on those who fired him. If you are looking for surprises Jerry Maguire will not match your expectations. But if you want a joyful, funny, vivid film which isn't stupid and trashy at the same time, than Jerry Maguire truly is the perfect choice.Jerry Maguire beautiful played by Tom Cruise, is an agent who has a one in a lifetime, nocturne revelation which ends with memo in which he suggests that agencies should have fewer athletes under contract, so that the agent/athlete relationship would be much closer, more sincere. However, it seems his employers do not appreciate Jerry's altruism and chose to dismiss him rapidly. If you think Jerry Ma-f..king-guire is the guy to back down well you're dead wrong. Instead he immediately decides to get his revenge on the agency, especially on Bob Sugar, his rival. The problem is the only athlete under contract with, it's the mouthy ,always unsatisfied Rod Tidwell... ...I dare to say that the characters are the main attraction of this film. Jerry Maguire, played very well by Tom Cruise is the handsome type, a spontaneous charismatic, character, extremely skilled in his job as a sport agent. Rod Tidwell, though at least as spontaneous as his agent, is no more no less than a flippant, always dissatisfied with the financial aspect, arrogant and recalcitrant black male, just like his wife Marcee, the female version of her husband. Dorothy Boyd (Renee Zelwegger) - sweet and her son Ray (Johnatan Lipnicki) - a simple woman, perhaps too simple which still hasn't found her love, but looks to change this when she accompanies Jerry his attempt to regain his position as the best, most appreciated sport agent.As I said, this title, focuses more on character study rather than on a great scenario, which is, in fact, a regular, linear one. But the way it was illustrated by the director and actors in particular, was really special, making Jerry Maguire one of the most lively film that I have ever seen. I think the defining word for Jerry Maguire is alive, with great significance on dialogs, which were nonetheless sparkling and generous with unique lines like: ""show me the money!""As a conclusion, I state that Jerry Maguire is Overall a good film, very good at times, well worth a **** out of ***** rating (8/10)",Jerry Maguire
170,Bill21,Is this what we've come to?,2,21 May 1999,"If Jerry Maguire is a typical American, give me a one-way ticket to Winnipeg.  This is a film whose values are so out of whack that it shocks me that it's universal acclaim confounds me.  The film tells us the following: money is important, public affection is important (sure Cuba Gooding and the Daughter from ""227"" are a cute couple, but if they were making out at a restaurant in front of me, I'd slap 'em till they were insane), jazz is bad and lame (I guess John Coltrane and Miles Davis aren't as venerable music talents as Heart), and of course, America sets the tone for the world. The whole film can be summed up with one sequence.  Rod Tidwell catches a touchdown and inspires a nation on Monday Night Football.  What does that mean?  Tidwell can now bank on a fat new contract.  Boy that's a real tear-jerker.  Go rent ""Brian's Song,"" and get your priorities in order.",Jerry Maguire
171,Sack-3,So good that it destroyed careers,9,13 March 2003,"I just saw Jerry Maguire again for the first time since I saw it on the big screen back in 96.  What a great flick!  It was even better than I remembered it.  What struck me was how great the three leads were: Cruise, Gooding, and Zellweger.  Cruise has history.  There was no way that he'd be defined by Maguire, but the other two were more newcomers -- at least to me. I can remember saying: watch Gooding and Zellweger, they're going places! But they never did.  Not on to level I expected.  Is it possible that Jerry Maguire set the bar so high for these two young actors that they could never again meet the audience's expectations? This seems to be a problem for Zellweger in particular.  I thought Nurse Betty was a fine movie.  Bridget Jones less so.  But they were both disappointing because Zellweger could not raise her performance to the level she did in Jerry Maguire.  Same story with Cuba Gooding.  Every time I see him in another movie I want him to SNAP OUT OF IT and start strutting around preaching about Quan.The ending was awesome: Romantic conclusion followed by the comic wrap-up.

It's about a sports agent who gets fired from his job and starts out on his own. The only sports athlete that he has left is Cuba Gooding JR(who won best supporting actor). There are also a lot of cry baby moments in the film. The relationship between Jerry and the little kid is priceless. And how about that very funny scene when Cuba wants more money. SHOW ME THE MONEY!SHOW ME THE MONEY! And again, what about the fact that it won an Oscar? Do you think that a movie is going to be very,very terrible and win an Oscar? The overall plot and point of the film is to when the going gets tough, the tough gets going. Jerry Maguire is a film that when it comes on TV, I have to watch.

180,wainot,This movie keeps getting better for me ...,10,12 June 2004,"While Jerry Maguire is equal parts romance and sports-related movie, JM is among my favorites in both genres. And yes, I got sick of the phrase, ""Show me the money"" and even, ""You complete me"", shortly after its release, but that's not the fault of this movie.I'm not a huge Tom Cruise fan, but I think this is his best role to date. In JM, he is equal parts movie star and actor, and his scenes with everyone in the cast are great. Ditto for Renee Zellweger: I admit to having a bit of a love-hate (well, not quite that extreme w/ her.)..to me, she never looked better or did better acting - from the heart- (w/ out dipping into a bag of tricks a la Cold Mountain) than in JM. She is radiant, sympathetic, charming and shows great comic instincts as well.Cuba Gooding, Jr. was very worthy of an Oscar nomination (I personally would have had him runner-up to Wm. H Macy in Fargo that year) --nevertheless he energizes the movie in creating the inimitable Rod Tidwell. The other supporting players all hit just the right notes: Bonnie Hunt as the jaded older sister, Jay Mohr as the sleaz-o agent, Regina King (brilliant) as Marcy Tidwell, Todd Louiso as the nanny/child technician, Kelly Preston as the b__tchy fiancée, and on and on. And then, they're probably all upstaged every time little Jonathan Lipnicki appears as Ray (go on, name me a more endearing child performance - ever - in the movies). This movie offers terrific, sharp writing, great acting, solid pacing and perfect use of music as well, and a great blend of comedy, romance and drama. .. For me, this movie earns a rare 10/10!

Zellweger, my favorite actress, is fabulous.  In fact, the whole cast is a marvel.  I also love Cameron Crowe's really witty script.  It is so sharp.  How does it lose to Fargo for best original screenplay?  Don't get me wrong, Fargo was great, but Jerry Maguire was just better.

Renee Zellwager is a single mother, with one little boy who pops up once in awhile in this movie. The movie's are so amazing and so funny at times that some of them you'll never forget for a long time.Basically this movies follows around Jerry Maguire.

There is a certain feel-good factor to this film, as there are with most Cameron Crowe films which makes it very hard to dislike. The other great thing about Crowe's films is that everything is real from the characters to their emotions to the whole story. The casting of Tom Cruise is near-perfect as I could not imagine anyone to better portray an ambitious and willing sports agent. Asides the good movie and acting, this is surely one of the most quotable films to date with ""You had me at 'hello'"", ""Show me the money!!"" and ""You complete me"".

194,fox-63,One of my favorite films of all time,10,28 May 2000,"This has to be the best romantic comedy of all time.  It was flawlessly written, directed, and acted.  If I had to pick only one film to own this would be it.  I absolutely loved.  If you look at it, you can see how glossy and ageless the picture looks.  It is almost five years old, but it still looks so modern.  It also has one of my favorite scenes ever from a directing point of view.  It is the one where he shakes Cush's dads hand, and the camera i constantly moving.  It makes me drool thinking about.It moved a man to tears.  Go see it now!!!",Jerry Maguire
195,MrSharma,meh...nothing special,7,5 December 2005,"Viewing this film for the first time after being made aware of its several Academy Award nominations, included the reputed Best Picture and Best Director (Cameron Crowe), I was disappointed in how thin this film actually was. But then again, how deep can you go when you're dealing with a romantic comedy? Still, I am yet to understand what all the big hype is about.Tom Cruise delivers an excellent performance as Jerry Maguire, a disgruntled sports agent who loses his job and dignity after having an epiphany about the lack of morals within his basic workplace. He falls for a single mother (Renee Zellweger), simultaneously developing a strong bond with her child and hence embarking on a trip of personal and professional redemption. Cuba Gooding JR is full deserving of his Oscar win as Best Supporting Actor, and Renee Zellweger is solid as always. But that's just about it. A fine cast delivers memorable performances, but what else has this movie got? Crowe's direction is very simple, arguably crossing the line from being ""unpretentious"" to ""boring"". The more technical elements of the picture are also mediocre at best, with simple editing and cinematography contributing to what is ultimately a fairly simple film all round. At the end of the film, you are left feeling that what you viewed was practically the same as any other feel-good romantic comedy that you would watch otherwise. The only difference: a better cast.I must say here that this film's critical recognition by the Academy is one of the most ridiculous things that I've ever heard of. Sure, the film was OK and simple, but to claim that it stood up even as a nominee against the likes of the brilliant ""The English Patient"" and ""Shine"" at the 1997 Academy Awards is an insult to that year and illustrates a deterioration of the medium. This is not to say that Crowe is a bad director or that this was, by any means, a terrible film, but it is by no means deserving of the critical hype that accompanied its theatrical release.All in all, a decent romantic comedy with excellent acting and relatively good editing. But, by all means, nothing special.",Jerry Maguire
196,MusicDefined,just when I think Tom Cruise is done,10,3 May 1999,"Every time I watch a Tom Cruise movie, I compare it to my favorite one, Rain Man.  Even though he wasn't the main character, I still feel that it is his best acting job.  The closest he has ever come to that is Jerry Maguire. When I sat and watched this movie the first time, I kept thinking to myself, ""This better be much better than 'Days of Thunder' or I'm walking out."" Then within the first five minutes, I was hooked.  Tom Cruise has some kind of magnetic charm over everyone in the world...it's scary.  So that is my favorite aspect of the film, the acting. Next is Cameron Crowe.  I thought that this movie was a little better than his previous work, Say Anything-which I love-and Fast Times At Ridgemont High-which is okay.  The writing seemed to be very similar to Say Anything, with the monologues and the quick dialogue back and forth between characters...and of course the dramatic love scenes. I also loved the child, Jonathan Lipnicki...he was so cute.  He is the kid that should be in every movie, but of course that is impossible. I wish that the movie would have been longer...or lingered more on the relationship between Jerry and Dorothy...I felt that that part of the movie went by way too quickly...but that is just me. Finally, I love the way the movie ends...it is one of those endings that makes you feel why they make movies anymore...besides, I know that I had you all, ""at hello...I had you at hello.""",Jerry Maguire
197,simon-fredriksson,Sporty love story,6,14 July 2013,"Amusing comedy drama that alternates between being a mockery of greed in the sports world and romantic comedy. Tom Cruise, in one of his best roles, plays sports agent Jerry Maguire. He is tired of the cynicism in the sports world. When he gets fired and is starting his own business, it is only two who believe in him to succeed. A secretary (Renée Zellweger) and a promising player (Cuba Gooding Jr.) in American football. The questions then become two: Will Jerry Maguire get back together with the secretary, who is a single mother? Is the football player going to become a star? The film was nominated for many awards, including best film, but only Cuba Gooding Jr. won an Oscar, then for Best Supporting Actor. Cameron Crowe's film is filled with so much humor, charm and warmth, that it does not matter that it is a bit predictable.",Jerry Maguire
198,dorada_19,"First Rate Actors, 90s Clichés",5,11 February 2013,"I will try to not parrot what has already been said about the movie, for better or worse. I have nothing against the actors of the feature film. They were the best of the best in that genre and generation. My issue is with all the product placement and overall marketing that the film is bombarded with ranging from Reebok, Apple Jacks, NFL and I don't know how many other products. If one is not discerning, one can fall for it and feel like ESPN is the ultimate authority in sports and that the NFL is the best thing that there is. I won't question the integrity of these entities because that's not what this review is about. The cameos from real life corporate executives further reinforced the marketing at play her. I just think that it would have felt more artistic and original to have come up with a pretend organization resembling the ones mentioned so that the viewer is not resold on the idea that big corporations truly benefit humanity and actually constitute a culture. For a movie about redemption and love, there is the underlying message that money and materialism is the agent that facilitates can destroy and redeem you. This may be true, and I am no bleeding heart; but movies should not always reinforce the obvious.One of the more positive aspects of the movie was seeing the Tidwell's as a normal and married black couple rather than bickering losers having illegitimate offspring. You could see Crowe's sensitivity and trying to elevate the dialogue without being soppy.I think what made this movie so zeitgeist was that it captured and incorporated the rampant and materialism of the 1990s. This decade was more greedy than the 80s because suddenly actors and athletes had the fattest paychecks simply for being entertainers. They suddenly became royalty. This decade was the beginning of the endorsement culture that blew up in the 2000s. The general public truly believed that bigger was better and resented being told otherwise. SUV's, designer clothes, limitless credit cards, supersized meals and Venti sized coffee's were almost a requirement.If you want to see a well acted film you will not be disappointed. I recommend looking at the movie with a grain of salt and detaching oneself from the underlying capitalist and elitist message that it sends.",Jerry Maguire

My girlfriend surprised me by saying she liked it.  Then over the ensuing months I was continually shocked by positive comments, great box office and ultimately Oscar Consideration for this film.This movie is simplistic, vapid, humourless and at times offensive.

He could well be a good defendant of Frank Lloyd Wright's motto:`Beauty is just the brilliance of Men's light'Jerry Maguire is, above all, a great Cameron Crowe film, filled with happiness, energy, passion and talent, that touches all the romantic people in the world, as well as all others, I believe.When we see Tom Cruise looking at Zellwegger and saying: `That's more than a dress. That's an Audrey Hepburn movie', we just gotta feel immensely in love. Another really important aspect, that is starting to brand Cameron Crowe, is launching great actresses; in `Almost Famous' we finally see Kate Hudson, who only had minor parts to date, suddenly going to the Oscars and almost wining one; and here, in `Jerry Maguire', Renée Zellwegger has a great performance and jumps for the stars!If this `Jerry Maguire' has something wrong, then it is definitely timing; if it had been done 20 years ago, in the 80's, or maybe even much earlier, about 40 years sooner, then today many would be calling it a classic. I believe in 20 or 30 years many of us will be saying, remembering it:-Oh, Jerry Maguire! a great film! Really a classic of love, hope and happy ending.

Now having watched it, I know what I've been missing out on! This is a great film about someone realising that they are a good person who is not doing the best for the people that need him to be. Jerry Maguire strives to do what's right for his clients and through basically the collapse of his life looks back to the life lessons that his original mentor taught him and realises that he has lost his way. This was a brilliant story, lovable, funny, very very cheesy at times but purposefully so. All in all a feel good classic.",Jerry Maguire

I saw the DVD in the $5 bin a WalMart, said ""what the heck?"" and bought it. Tom Cruise is actually perfectly cast for the part of Jerry McGuire. Cuba Gooding, Jr. earned his Academy Award for his part as Rod Tidwell. Renee Zellweger was beautiful and charming as Dorothy Boyd. The score was excellent, meshing with the outstanding plot that actually gives you something to think about. All in all Camron Crowe made a movie that won't leave a bad taste in your mouth. If you don't have this move check out the $5 bin. You will get a lot of entertainment for the money.",Jerry Maguire

206,JoeyMarie,Everybody loved him... Everybody disappeared,10,5 June 2001,"Love...irony...lust...loyalty...trust...all taglines of life, that is, if you're Jerry Maguire. This beautifully written and directed movie is & always will be my favorite movie. It took viewers on a roller coaster ride of emotional wave after another and right back around. The message in this movie was very touching and worth a minute or two of thought. The movie not only relayed a message through the dialect and content, but on a more personal level where you could relate in one-way or another, no matter what age.Whether you're an athlete striving for excellence, single mother trying to get ahead in life, the child of that mother, or even a sports agent, this romantic and funny drama is a movie to be treasured. I definitely recommend, if you liked this movie, that you see 'A Walk in the Clouds' with Keanu Reeves. Both movies tie together life lessons and the main message that we should just step down from our podiums over-looking our lives and see the true meaning and value of life...because ""the journey is everything""...",Jerry Maguire

209,yisraelharris,Excellent Movie,8,1 June 2006,"This movie seems to have all of the necessary ingredients for a blockbuster. No wonder it was so well liked.1. The basic setting itself, that of sports agency, is exciting -- a cross-section of high-stakes business and professional sports.2. The basic plot is compelling: a David-Goliah story, with the sincere David (Jerry McGuire) going up against the Goliaths of the sports agency industry. So many Hollywood films have scored using this formula.3. Lots of fun, clever, snappy dialogue, with the highlights: ""Show me the Money"", ""The Kwan"", ""You had me at hello..."" 4. There are so many well-written scenes, such as the frantic telephone chase, or the bathroom confrontation between Jerry and Rod. And there are so many ""big scenes"" throughout.5. Character development: so many of the characters, such as Jerry, Rod, and Dorothy, have real characters. But the minor characters, such as the Nanny, are also very engaging.6. The acting: all of the actors really sink their teeth into their roles, and come up with highly watchable performances.All combine to make this a very, very entertaining movie.",Jerry Maguire
210,mtiller12,"A loveable drama, rom com",8,7 June 2003,"""Jerry Maguire"" came out in 1996, it hit the box office and it proved it could cut it at the academy awards. It probably did so well at the box office because of Tom Cruise, the man was the main image of the posters and of course he played the title character. What ""Jerry Maguire"" did then was revitalise the rom com, drama. Jerry Maguire (Tom Cruise) is a sports agent, the guy you don't normaly see, everything he does is for money, not for one second has he ever doubted his place in the world and the buisness he is in. That is until one of his low key stars is injured severly and causes Jerry to think about what he is doing. What happens is he decides to share his views, in one night he just pours his feelings out. He is loved by everyone at the office and cheered for his courage (He would probably be fired) Now he is the man, he no longer questions himself, but just then, he is fired. Jerry is left to go it alone, with only one of his clients left, a failing family man named Rod Tidwell (Cuba Gooding Jr.). The rest of the movie can not be broken down as it would be a spoiler. The first thing you say about when you hear the name ""Jerry Maguire"" is the Show Me The Money scene. It is one of the greatest scenes of all time and perhaps, the greatest scene of the nineties. Completely memorable, one of the biggest phrases of all time now, Tom Cruise potrays that scene excellently. He is desperate, time is running out, he now knows it is over and Cruise also givs the mood a boost by showing us how far a man will go to keep at least something from being over. Cuba Gooding Jr is also good there as well as his character is annoying Jerry and dosen't quite realise how important this is. When I write a review, I start with a little introduction with my thoughts and a few facts, then I write the plot, then I say the first thing that comes to mind about the movie I am reviewing and lastly I then comment on the cast, the directing and the script in that order, bu today I am going to do it in importance and how important they are into how the movie works. The directing by Cameron Crowe is his best. Good work, worthy of the oscar nomination he recieved. His simple shots are excellent with each one capturing the charaters features and thoughts. There is no room for style here, just a gritty portrayl, the tone he gives this film is just pure brilliance. Cameron Crowe never overdoes anything, nothing in this film is uneeded, this is just great directing, to simple to be fully appreciated like him not recieving the academy award. Now people's first thoughts is this film is long, I never question how long a movie is as long as it is good and I never questioned the quality of this film and it's script. It is witty, dramatic at times, maybe sentimental, brilliant in dialogue that moves you and great scenes. Crowe, who directed, was nominated for the script he wrote I think and I think it was beaten by ""Fargo"". Something I can't complain with is that, the script is better than the directing ecause of the effect, a work of brilliance that will always be more congratualted than the directing. Lastly in my three, the greatest thing about this movie, apart from Show Me The Money, is the cast and acting. Acting in this movie is completley memorable. Tom Cruise for starters was oscar nominated, Jerry Maguire is proably his most in depth character and Cruise gives him more depth than he proably has. It is comedic, deperate, calm, sweet and complete. Jerry is a characte who has decided to make a U-turn in his life and throughout the movie you can see at time that Jerry may be questioning his decision or sometimes believing it is the right one. Cruise perhaps has the best character he has ever had. Cuba Gooding Jr is also right on par as the fun loving, ego manic, Rod Tidwell. The character of Tidwell is perhaps harder to plat than people think because of the situation he is in, he is a family man trying to make a good home for his family but he also wants to play football and that he has a large ego needs to show as much as that he is a family man. Again Cuba does what Cruise did in the eyes, I always watch an actors eyes, his eyes says that I desperatly need this, I may be going out of buisness, but MAY go out of buisness. Rod is someone who accepts what is happening because he lovs his life more than people may know. Renee Zellwegger made a name for herself in this movie as Dorothy Boyd, who is single mother and Jerry's loyalist friend who loves him. The character again has massive depth but not as difficlt to pull off as the other two, Zellwegger makes the most of her screentime. The most astonishing part o the acting is the realtionship between Dorothy and Jerry, you can see these two people love each other but just can't show and for some reason are uncomfortable with it. They have a reconcilation at the end with another great peace of solo acting from Cruise and in the end are together hand in hand, you can see in their eyes now that they love each other and they are married. This really is a great achievment in modern day filmaking beacuse I beleive this movie is very appealing, characters who are completley memorable, scnes everything. I am thirteen years old and I love this movie, I love films like this, Sure I like the odd eighteens, adult crime movies and I have loads, but when a film like this comes along you just can't help but be gripped by it. ""Jerr Maguire"" is one of the best films of the last decade. You will love this movie anybody that has been in love, anybody that has gone it alone, anybody who know what these kind of situations are and underatnds then will love this movie. I mean ANYbody, ""Jerry Maguire"" A GREAT  romatic, drama... with a pinch of comedy.",Jerry Maguire
211,Supereyes206,The dumbest movie I have ever seen.,1,20 March 2016,"This film is nothing more than a pretentious Tom Cruise flick. The movie is all about him. Probably demanded by Tom Cruise himself. It is not about Jerry Maguire. It is about this guy who has the girl of his dreams, and everything in his life is so perfect. Dumb clichés and cheesy moments. I mean really. Forget that this film is about a famous sports agent. It's about Tom Cruise's dream world. He comes into work and people start clapping like he's this extraordinary hero. He was just a freaking sports agent! It was completely forced.So many of those moments where the film pushes for drama or comedy. There is this kid with glasses who is cute but it is all about Tom Cruise. A perfect Dad, loves kids, can play football, he is wealthy, has a girlfriend and he is handsome. The story serves no purpose. It is all just to make Tom Cruise's fame shine. The boss' party scene dedicated to Jerry Maguire is so stupid. The clips shown of all the girls talking about Jerry Maguire's looks and Maguire being uncomfortable by it--meaningless. Of course Tom Cruise loves it. He is clearly a narcissist. This film is about nothing more than just a handsome guy, or should I just say, truthfully, it is about Tom Cruise? All the drama is stupid such as the ex-girlfriend punching Tom Cruise in the face, man getting punched by a woman, or ""Show me the money!"" or the scene where Maguire asks someone in the office to go with him (to I forget where) and Renee Zellweger's character says, ""I'll go"" Over the top drama and acting. This film has just about all the cheesiest/cliché and dumbest moments you can think of.This might be a fun movie if you're drunk but it is seriously really bad. All in all, the idea of this film's marketing is to say that it is about a famous, inspirational, sports agent is just a farce. Because it is not. It is just a movie about a movie star. It was about selling you Tom Cruise's life.",Jerry Maguire
212,e-jane,Harmless fluff.,5,7 March 1999,"It's hard not to like Jerry Maguire, because it's one of the few romantic comedies that I've seen lately that manages to stay sweet without pushing it and becoming contrived and saccharine.  Tom Cruise tones down the overacting for once, and Renee Zellweger, Cuba Gooding Jr, and Jonathan Lipnicki are all as charming as they come.But that said, the movie is hardly the cinematic masterpiece it's been made out to be.  It certainly has a fair amount of substance in its treatment of the theme of moral growth, but it's nothing to write home about technically, and, while it may be cute, the plot in general is nothing we haven't seen before and doesn't offer any real ingenuity.But it is certainly worth spending a couple of dollars, since it is a particularly good example of its genre and has a genuine feel-good quality. Just don't expect anything too exceptional.",Jerry Maguire
213,Smiley-19,Best Tom Cruise Movie so far,10,16 January 1999,This is one of my favorite movies of all time. The movie itself was charming and I love watching every minute of it. Tom Cruise gave his best and Renee Zelwegger showed a great performance.,Jerry Maguire
214,Maverick-63,One of my favorite movies ever,10,18 August 1999,"Jerry Maguire is one of my personal favorite films. Cameron Crowe's wonderful script and direction is full of nuances and subtleties that reward repeat viewings, and indeed gets better with each viewing.Each scene of Jerry Maguire is so ""perfect"" that it looks like  Cameron Crowe went to the kinds of lengths Stanley Kubrick did on that other Tom Cruise vehicle, the (awful) film Eyes Wide Shut. Of course Crowe did not try to achieve that kind of perfectionism, which leads me to believe his vision and talent were just so strong that he did not need to--he achieved as close to ""perfection"" as possible anyway.Never has a role been more suited to Tom Cruise. And one realizes just how good Renee Zelwegger is when viewing her other performances (which are so utterly different from Dorothy Boyd), and seeing how she truly inhabits the character (I was convinced that Renee Z. was not ""acting"" and simply ""was"" a Dorothy Boyd-like character until I saw her other (mostly bitchy) prior roles).I cannot give enough praise to Cameron Crowe's script. Jerry Maguire is such a true-to-life, three-dimensional character. I love that he does not always say the right thing. I have always found it slightly annoying that in big dramatic scenes, the main character always has the ""perfect"" line, retort, etc., whereas in real life we all know this rarely if ever happens. I love that Cameron did not give Jerry all the perfect dialogue--he fumbles and babbles, which for me kept him quite believable. (Until his ""You complete me"" line anyway.) God knows if this film had been written by the typical big-budget Hollywood ""team"" of writers, there would be no truly memorable lines like ""you complete me"" and ""show me the money"".I love the Dicky Fox scenes dispersed throughout the main storyline. I wish the DVD version had indexed those scenes, because they are priceless.The supporting cast is wonderful. Regina King is perfect (as always). Bonny Hunt as the older sister Laurel is delightful. Kelly Preston and Jay Mohr are brilliant and pitch perfect. And Cuba got an Oscar so nuff said there.This is that rare Hollywood film with a unique artistic voice, and I greatly look forward to the next Cameron Crowe film.",Jerry Maguire

Jerry McGuire was alive in this movie with real depth and real feelings.Recommended viewing.  Rating: 10,Jerry Maguire
216,Tom-2128,Successful multi genre,9,26 February 2007,"This movie is a comedy, drama, romance, sports movie, and a money movie (e.g. Wall Street, where the main character is trying to make a lot of money). The problem such a movie faces is maintaining a consistent tone. Remember Prizzi's Honor? JM solves that problem by using restraint. It doesn't go over the top, although its characters sometimes do. It has funny moments, but it's not Animal House or American Pie. It's a drama, but it keeps the stakes low. This isn't Armageddon: they aren't trying to save the world. There are no life or death decisions. The romantic stakes aren't that high either: Renee Zellweger loves Tom Cruise, but she's been in love before and if this doesn't work out, she will be again. The only really high stakes are the money. By keeping the stakes low, JM let's us watch it with a bit of detachment.This is more of a drama than a comedy. A good test is whether the characters change. Here, Tom Cruise starts off completely cynical, abruptly changes to ridiculously idealistic, then spends the rest of the movie finding the right balance. Renee Zellweger starts by loving Tom Cruise from afar, then gets him, then has to work out her ambiguous feelings.JM is fun to watch. The characters, though flawed, are sympathetic. We enjoy watching them succeed, fail (sometimes in funny ways), and try to discover what they really care about. It's complicated, thoughtful, and surprisingly subtle.",Jerry Maguire

219,sunsetsymphony,This is the power of Hollywood,8,2 April 2020,"""Jerry Maguire"" I watched in 2020 for the first time, and I was absolutely captivated by the insanely quality acting by part of Tom Cruise and the many supporting roles in this film; the beautiful/funny/iconic cinematography; the witty/perfectly timed dialogue (I loved the au pair); and the internal/interpersonal conflict that drives forward oh-so-well the plot in a way that never bores. Did I mention the incredible acting? You don't find quality of acting with a similar depth of expression these days. The development of Jerry's relationship with his client over the film, as well as the fantastically dynamic change of pace in Jerry's character (excited, fast, over-the-top to mellow, sensual, and thoughtful) aged like fine wine over those 2 hours. The way in which they finally achieve their goal is unique, hilarious, and tearjerking too. This film made me feel a LOT of things, and I was hooked from the beginning and now attached to it for good, for better or worse.Sure, this film has its downsides too (it is Hollywood, after all).
-Renee Zellweger's character predominantly plays the role of the typical, head-over-heels woman who falls for the guy literally every single time he makes even a half-assed attempt to win her back. Clearly she gets what she wants, but not having learned a damn thing about herself even by the end of the film (not a good female role model - that's Hollywood for ya). Not blaming Renee - she was fantastic - but the ones who created the persona of her character fatally missed the vital interesting ingredient: true female empowerment.
-I felt like the blah, typical happily-ever-after dramatic scene in the living room truly took away from the brilliance of this film, which succeeded in making this story come to life from so many different facets.
-Tom Cruise is so attractive that it is mortifyingly distracting (maybe not the worst negative to a film, but worth mentioning nonetheless).All in all, although I gripe with the lack of substance behind Renee's character, I can't help but preach that this film is brilliant and one that truly had me at hello.",Jerry Maguire

This is a classic film because it had those few key lines in it that are always going to be cute and recognizable when you hear them! I mean ""I you had me at Hello"" what a great line. ""The Human head weighs eight pounds"" so cute. I'm not the biggest Tom cruse fan, but I enjoyed the speech he made when he left the office. I like his taking of the gold fish very ballsy. Rene Zellweiger does a really great job playing the cute single mother who needs to make a change in her life. Cubba Gooding Junior is very funny I love his show me the money dance, his positivity is infectious. The movie is fairly entertaining, it's kind of like cambels chicken noodle, it's not the most colorful or the best but it taste good and it comfortable. It's a good movie to pop in when your sick because it will make you laugh and feel warm fuzzies in the end!",Jerry Maguire

Can't you just hear the producers at the company: ""We need money, let's make a romantic comedy. Put in Tom Cruise and a cute kid and women will line up around the block. Add a sports theme, with real pro athletes and announcers, men will be more than happy to go also. Throw in a Bruce Springsteen song and we have a license to print money!!"" But, in spite of all this, the movie was still pretty good. The story is true, agents are ruining sports. The romantic side of the story wasn't bad either. See, commercialism isn't always bad!",Jerry Maguire

He was totally vulnerable. Cuba Gooding Jr. gave one of my favorite performances as a mediocre football player that is full of love for his family, and that is nice to see.  He did deserve his Oscar and all the success he has been having.This has a beautiful mix of drama, romance and comedy. A must see. My grade: A-",Jerry Maguire
224,ktgirl8301,Just Read What I Have to Say,8,26 January 2001,"I just recently saw this movie with some friends after Homecoming last September, and it was excellent.  Some parts were a little boring or stressful, but the ending made up for everything.  I admit I cried a little. But it was so well-written!!  Okay, that's it.  Tom Cruise is so fine, he makes any movie good.  Well ... okay, yeah, even Mission: Impossible 2.",Jerry Maguire
225,frances59,You Had Me At Hello,9,21 September 2009,"In 1996, ""Jerry McGuire"" proved itself as a breakthrough film for many of its cast and crew. It earned many awards, including five Oscar nominations (Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor (Tom Cruise),...), winning two (Best Original Screenplay and Best Supporting Actor (Cuba Gooding Jr.)). Therefore, this film proved the true potential in several of its cast members, namely Tom Cruise, Renee Zellweger, Cuba Gooding Jr., and producer, director, and writer Cameron Crowe (2000's ""Almost Famous"", 2005's ""Elizabethtown""). Though some had previously stretched themselves as artists occasionally, this film earned them newfound respect like never before. ""Jerry McGuire"" follows a greedy workaholic sports agent who suddenly loses his job. This begins his path of soul searching, which teaches him many life lessons, namely his true love. When Dorothy enters his life, he realized the true worth of money is much less than the finer things in life which are free. Meanwhile, he begins his own agency. Only few of his clients follow him. All except one, Ray, maintain this relationship with Jerry. This becomes closer than ever as Jerry struggles to help him find his place in football and later, of purpose. These series of story lines create an eyeopening masterpiece that leads to a powerful and unforgettable conclusion. Cameron Crowe begins his series of masterpieces with this film. He proves in this film that he is one of the finest filmmakers of today. He takes a creative, unique story and adds great substance in its events. These written words often find some humorous scenes that maintains its dramatic theme unbelievably. This shows that films don't need a large budget to attract audiences or to be amazing. As with his following films, he never rushes any of his projects. He assures himself that they are full quality, and that every storyline fit one another. In particular, ""Jerry McGuire"" adds some clever quotes that make this film for added viewing pleasure including ""you had me at hello"", ""you complete me"", ""did you know that a human head weighs eight pounds"", and the most prominent ""show me the money"". This undistinguishable writing style proves that sometimes, the most unexpected becomes the highlight. This roller coaster film could not be as enjoyable if it wasn't for the brilliant performances, namely but not limiting Tom Cruise, Renee Zellweger, and Cuba Gooding Jr. They give their characters the unforgettable presence that may be close to impossible to most other actors. Cruise offers his signature acting style to new extremes to the main character Jerry McGuire. Zellweger's more emotional performances gives greater strength to the film's dramatic and romantic value. Gooding offers the more eccentric theme that often gives the famous film quotes new meaning. Such film quality proves that ""Jerry McGuire"" has and always will stand the test of time. This will surely please a variety of audiences, the more dramatic and the more comedic. It has proved its capabilities as a future film classic.",Jerry Maguire
226,sdansby,A Hollywood First!,9,20 May 2002,"I first viewed this movie in 1996.  It immediately became one of my favorites.  One of my measuring sticks for any movie is do you feel anything emotionally for the characters or the story?  The answer for this movie is yes. The movie also has a role reversal seldom if ever seen in Hollywood, a black male who is characterized as a sound family man.  It is actually he (Rod Tidwell), who gives Jerry Maguire advise and counseling.   Bravo Cameron Crowe!!    My rating 9/10.",Jerry Maguire
227,Comedian215,"""He is Jerry MaGuire""",8,28 August 2004,"This movie was very touching and well-written. I think Cameron Crowe did a very good job writing and directing this film. The characters were all so amazingly well developed, that after watching the whole movie, you begin to think wow! Tom Cruise is Jerry Maguire, Renee Zellweger is Dorothy Boyd. That was also a very good sign of acting.The will of each character, to not give up was just very moving. The way that Rod Tidwell and Jerry Maguire fight to get the big contract, and how Jerry fights to keep Dorothy in love with him, it was just powerful.Jerry Maguire is a film that deserves to be seen more than once, and deserves to become one of most memorable films of the 1990's.",Jerry Maguire
228,irishguy122,This doesn't complete me...,4,5 June 2012,"Tom Cruise is an actor I've never had much time for. He has a certain way of looking in situations that shock his characters that I never found realistic, and it borders on annoying. Also, I can't help but feel his career is slipping downhill in recent years.Anyway, this is a review of 'Jerry Maguire' not Tom Cruise. This movie was fairly poor, for a few reasons. Firstly, the acting fails to convince, Cruise gives a respectable performance and Gooding Jr, having seen him in two movies, gives the best performance of his career (but not Oscar worthy; how did that happen?) and Bonnie Hunt puts in a decent shift. It is Rene that unfortunately drags the movie down. Her character is overly vulnerable, to an almost caricature point, and I'm not sure if its down to the script or her, but she looked uncomfortable in the role. Combined with a weak and predictable plot, a overly long running time and several thoroughly annoying characters, this movie fails in just about every department.You can do far worse than 'Jerry Maguire', but not worth the view",Jerry Maguire

232,scotch-4,A real stinker,1,9 December 2007,"This movie was so bad we couldn't get through the credits to watch any more. Tom Cruise is lethal in his overacting. You could see from the credits how bad it was going to be. It is filled with standard clichés and that's just in the credits. You knew it wasn't going to get any better. A waste of a movie rental. A real stinker. Luckily we turned on the television just to catch the start of Casablanca, a truly great romantic film. Where is today's Humphrey Bogart? Don't waste your time and money on this film. Forget Jerry Maguire just re-watch Casablanca. You'll come away amazed at what a great movie can be. This film is not worth ten lines of text.",Jerry Maguire
233,sean-107,interesting love story,8,12 February 2000,this is a suprisingly good effort by cameron crowe offering a very realistic approach to the love story theme. Cruise is excellent as always. I don't necessarily see an oscar in Gooding's performance though he was the ideal person for the role. One problem: when Cruise's character tries to break things off with his wife (kelly preston) she resorts to beating him up. Sterotypical hollywood approach. The only real embarrasing scene in the movie in terms of lack of realism. Excellent direction overall with some nice surrealistic qualities (which is why I'm suprised this movie did so well).

Cruise does nothing for me and I find his character's actions wholly distasteful.  The relationship between his character and what's-her-face (yeah, she's a memorable one in this role, all right) is tepid and the scene at the end requires a suspension of disbelief that I can't quite accommodate.Gooding's character is likeable but again, at the end...well, I just can't quite believe it.",Jerry Maguire

236,PapaRock145,Great movie with an exciting story and well thought humor,10,25 November 2012,"You can tell after watching Jerry Maguire that this movie isn't in it for just some quick money. The movie has a lot of heart and a great sense of humor to back it up. The story is simple enough, a sports agent loses his job and is desperately trying to keep his head above water in the sports business. He falls in love along the way and it turns into a love story. This movie has a great cast including a Tom Cruise who is wonderful in it. Cruise straddles the line between desperate and crazy with Jerry Maguire and in the process delivers some hilarious scenes (SHOW ME THE MONEY). Cuba Gooding Jr. is strong throughout (as he and Maguire are almost equals in their life situation). The film manages to not go to melodramatic and keep the comedy coming. For me, the whole movie is made by Tom Cruise. In particular, I find his reactions hilarious. The firing sequence along with his facial expressions when answering the devastating phone-call in Cushman's apartment are prime examples of Cruise's greatness in this movie. If you want a flick that is smart and witty but also offers up an engaging love-story and interesting plot, look no further than Jerry Maguire.",Jerry Maguire
237,nell_ward,Very emotional,8,12 March 2012,"It's all well and good to stroll through life with a healthy air of scepticism, but despite some peoples' views on these supposedly 'manipulative' romantic films, there are an elite few that really do have things to say based on something more noble than ticket sales - things that are actually worth listening to.Jerry Maguire is one of these rare beasts. No, it's not perfect, and no, it doesn't ring true for every last second of its running time, but if you come away from it with a sneer rather than a genuine desire to take a step back and look at yourself, then there's no romance in your soul at all. It's a genre that's always been particularly susceptible to the flood of lacklustre money-spinners, so to come across something that's had so much visible thought and effort thrown into it from all corners is a revelation. I'm not naive enough to think that anything making it big in the film industry these days can be purely a labour of love, but Jerry Maguire at least comes close.It's refreshing to see Tom Cruise demonstrate that, against all odds, he can act his heart out when given the right role, as can Cuba Gooding Jr. (neither of them better previously or since) - and the rest of the cast give it every bit as much passion. It's beautifully written, and shot with an easy style that makes me wish there were more directors like Cameron Crowe in this world.And on top of that, it gets better with each viewing. Even the soundtrack feels as if weeks have been spent fine-tuning it to perfection, and I'm no fan of Springsteen or Tom Petty. Deride it if you like, I'm not saying that Jerry Maguire's totally free of sentiment... I'm just suggesting that it's not necessarily a bad thing to have your heartstrings tugged and your self-awareness questioned once in a while.",Jerry Maguire
238,LtStrbuck,I can't but help loving this movie!,9,18 May 2000,"This movie is both fun and dramatic when it blends the ups and downs of Jerry's life; in his work (down) and how much he learns about himself (up). And it is SO romantic.It's the love story in this film that I like the most and putting Renée Z and Tom C together in this movie is genious. They are both very attractive and the acting, I think it is very good. When they play against each other and little mr Lipnicki is with them; it's magic. I may be a helpless romantic, but I can't help myself, it's so good.Also Cuba G makes a very good role, and he deserved that Oscar. I can't believe the good shape he was in. Makes one want a personal trainer right away...It's a must see!",Jerry Maguire
239,tommyman,And Cameron Crowe's magic continues..,10,27 July 2006,"I just watched Jerry Maguire again last night for, like, the tenth time on the cable. The film could still pretty much shook me emotionally. I still remember the first time I had watched it; I had almost cried at the ""You had me at hello"" scene (And I can assure you that I am the kind of guys who don't cry). Last night, the impact of the scene was still there for me, though not as much as it used to be but, hey, I have watched this film more than ten times already.I just can't describe how much I love this movie. Everyone gives a superb performance including Tom Cruise and, yes, you heard me right, Tom Cruise. He should have won an Oscar for the role of Jerry Maguire, period. For me, no offense to Cuba Gooding, I think he is even better than Cuba in the movie. Rene Zellweger couldn't be cuter in the movie, She makes Dorothy the girl of every man's dream. Bonny Hunt also gives believable performance as Dorothy's caring sister. It's a shame that she hasn't had any decent roles ever since.All in all, the biggest kudo should go to Cameron Crowe. This is definitely his best work ever. It may not be as personal as ""Almost famous"" or as raw as ""Say anything"" but it is his best all around movie. Cameron Crowe is one of the best directors of his generation along with Alexander Payne.This film ranks high up there in my all-time list",Jerry Maguire
240,rasputin443556@yahoo.com,A boring and pretentious three hours,1,3 April 2000,"I went to this film, not knowing what to expect.  I'm not a big Tom Cruise fan, but I'm a sports fan, and hey, this is a sports movie. Big mistake.  I suffered through three hours of seeing Renée Zellweger (very talented actress, this was the first time I saw her) say that Tom Cruise's character was such a great guy for actually saying he should spend time on his sports athlete clients.  At the expense of other clients. Zellweger does a good job, though there's no reason why her character or anyone else would quit her job because some guy wrote a few words about caring.  Many of us receive stuff like this in regular inspirational e-mails from our bosses or coworkers, and see what Dorothy (Zellweger) failed to see -- it's talk, and it's cheap. Cruise spends three hours trying to show that he cares about something or everything.  There's little reason to see this as anything but acting through the lines in the script, as Cruise never once manages to show that he does care. The great thing about this movie is how it resusciated Cuba Gooding Jr.'s career from unwarranted obscurity.  Aside from that, there's little to like here.  Why should any of us care that an agent got his prima donna star athlete a great contract?  Most of us work for far less in a decade than Maguire's one commission in an afternoon.",Jerry Maguire

Not to mention, the film housed yet another case of the sports world being one of the only avenues to black success.  In many cases, some of the world makes general assesments of minorities through film because they don't take the time or feel it is necesssary to learn much about others through personal contact, if they aren't forced to.Personally, I feel a film like Jerry McGuire with such stereotypical undertones, adds on to those second and third hand assessments.

The acting is also very good and Cuba Gooding Jnr is such a driving force and I believe this is one of the greatest acting collaborations ever seen. Over the top?

Tom cruise stands up for what he believes in by writing the manifesto ""what everyone is thinking but no one says."" He reaps the consequences of this move by getting fired but has the fortitude to never give up. He loses his marquee client and still never gives up. Jerry lives life on his own terms and would rather die than become a victim to his ideals. Jerry's story is a story of hope, determination, and pride.

A sports agent that grows a conscience, gets fired and has to rebuild his career and most importantly his life, I thought I was in for a boring couple of hours watching your typical sports drama but how wrong could I have been. It actually had very little to do with sports. It was a love story but again not your typical one. For me, it was all the different characters that made this film such as success. Tom Cruise has always been kind of an action figure in his movies which he's good at but for me, playing Jerry Maguire was by far his best work ever. He has brilliant timing and plays a character who's down on his luck so well, he should have got an Oscar for this but it's not only him that deserves credit. They all do. From Dorothy (Rene Zellweger) as the doting mum who falls hopelessly in love with Jerry even though she knows she shouldn't and her adorable son Ray who even as a small child, he even steals some of the scenes in this film. Also I loved Bonnie Hunt in this. This role definitely suited her as she plays the disapproving sister of Dorothy's. And of course, probably the main reason to watch this is to see Cuba Gooding Jnr as he plays the American football star Rod Tydwell and he is absolutely brilliant as both him and Tom work really well with each other. This film has everything. It will make you laugh, cry and will make you feel good and will always be remembered, not only for those famous quotes but for the characters as well. I think those casting agents should congratulate themselves on this one. Watch it, I know you'll love it",Jerry Maguire

It also gave one of best and worst ways to loose a job and it had a tear jerking ending.I love it and always will. Great viewing Tom Cruise at his height and something I doubt he will ever be able to repeat, for Jerry Maguire really was his shining moment and that the whole film worked from beginning to end. Great soundtrack as well but it was a real American story with a heart and they don't make them like that anymore!!!

In this role it's possible for him to open himself and can do his best acting. I also like Renee Zellweger as the woman who always believes in Jerry Maguire and the harmony between this two actors is very fine. But of course it's significant to mention the oscar winning performance of Cuba Gooding Jr. Whenever this actor is on the screen in this movie he shows us that he enjoys the work like nobody else. In my opinion they could have short the movie 10 - 20 minutes, so the movie has his lenghts sometimes but all in all it's a movie that's worth to be seen.

256,rikkiwonka,How beautiful is your sole?,10,30 January 2009,"Jerry MaGuire is arguably the most beautiful film ever made. In fact, I don't believe there is anything quite like it. When I often encounter the typical passionless British citizen with a fat belly who works in I.T, who has nothing but dislike and hatred for Tom cruise (and this is common in Britain), it paints a clear picture of the emotionless society we British people live in.People in Britain often live life in a disheartened state. British people are often disheartened by their sexless marriages, their mundane jobs, and their cowardice nature that prevents them from embracing the many beautiful things about life.In my experience, more often than not, British people live unhappily (compared to American's anyway) and they point their fingers at wonderful people like Tom Cruise to make themselves feel better. Jerry MaGuire is often considered a cinematic catastrophe by the British  and it's all because the British have no idea how to connect with their souls.This is why we are famous for disparaging our great people (until they are dead of course), because we are a gutless nation with no zeal for life and the things that make our existence so special.America is the greatest country in the world, and I think it has everything to do with the fact that their people are generally the most affable, genuine, happy, good-natured, passionate, people on the planet. I think the overall opinion of great cinematography says everything about a nation and its people.Jerry MaGuire is a film that is held dearly in the hearts of the American people. A film of love, trust, friendship, loyalty, and all the essential attributes required to be a great human-being who makes others happy also.Jerry MaGuire is a film of passion that inspires the human spirit to become a better spirit  a film that illustrates the unique beauty of the American people that very few Brits fully understand and appreciate.I know I'm not one of those Brits.Jerry MaGuire: you are my ambassador of Quan!",Jerry Maguire
257,arkos_1984,A Must Watch for any film lover.... What an honest picture!!!,10,25 May 2009,"The movie totally focused on the theme of the rise of the phoenix from his own ashes. An out of client sports agent, a struggling football star and a single mother creates their own destiny in order to survive and show everyone that they might be down but not out.Tom Cruise is an sports agent who lost his job when his girlfriend leaves him. Rene is the single mother who falls for Cruise and Cuba Gooding Jr. is the struggling football star who wants to reach the magical 10 million dollar mark before retiring.The fight back and realization of love and its importance makes Tom Cruise bewildered and there is the masterstroke from Crowe. Awesome cinematography, thoughtful editing and needless to say brilliant direction. Too bad that year the panel in the academy awards were all idiotic film experts who ignored both Cruise's and Crowe's performance.In my book Tom, Cuba , Cameron and Rene all deserves an Oscar for this movie.",Jerry Maguire
258,clarkesta,Jerry McQuire insults the intelligence!,1,5 January 2010,"It can take me years sometimes to see movies. On a whim, I decided to rent ""Jerry McQuire"" to find out why colleagues have been chanting ""show me the money"" all these years. I guess part of the reason is Cuba Gooding Jr's performance - he really is fantastic. But his character is symptomatic of why I wish I hadn't bothered. I'm taking into consideration that Jerry McQuire is an aging movie - and pre-11th September, 2001 - but was/is America really this shallow? I don't understand why any of the characters in this movie should be considered heroes. Overpaid sports ""stars"" ranting and demanding to be multi-millionaires because they feel they deserve it? A good-looking high-flyer who is irresistible to women?The best thing this movie does is expose an insidious industry for what it is, while managing to fool the majority of viewers into thinking there has been some kind of redemption and victory. If Tom Cruises' character had simply gone and sold hot dogs outside the Monday Night Football stadium after being fired he would have been making more of a personal journey and arguably more of a contribution to society. I enjoyed the scene where Cruise searches for a decent song on the radio in order to appreciate his upbeat mood. But as usual, it's Cruise playing.. well, Tom. He only ever plays one character - himself. If it was near the end of ""Rain man"" he would have had a true reason to be happy with himself. But the premise of the celebration is very, very dubious indeed. I kept waiting for the big revelation to arrive; when was McQuire going to reinvent himself or reinvent the industry to acknowledge and minimize the greed? I sat through an incredibly boring wedding and an even more boring break-up to arrive at the conclusion: an arrogant sports star is a hero for getting up after tripping over (in full protective gear!) and is now able to negotiate the contract which will keep his even more arrogant family happy.When you consider that the average African-American family would have been more than happy with the offer that was on the table during the bleak dark days before this movie reaches its ""climax"", I fail to see how ""Jerry McQuire"" connected with anyone.This movie insults the intelligence.",Jerry Maguire

It also provides a beautiful romantic relationship that is portrayed in everyone's experiences of love. It is centered around a masked figure in the entertainment industry: a successful sports agent. This is Jerry Maguire. This character can be described as a clever, successful womanizer who cannot say the words ""I love you."" The movie touches on the contrasts between love for the game and love for the women. If you are missing one, the other doesn't matter. All I have to say is that this movie is top three on my list and if u want to feel good for one night, watch it. It's a classic.",Jerry Maguire

He was so charming as a man who experiences successes and failures, learning something as a result. In this movie, Jerry's great at friendship... but he's bad at intimacy. As a result, though he was loved by everybody, that everybody disappears just when he experiences failure. That's what happens in real world. Having loyal people that will stick with you no matter what, that's priceless. This movie showed me what is really important in life. In life, success and money...OK that's important too. But somebody to share your success with, that's truly what counts. That's what gives people true happiness. I watched Top Gun, War of the Worlds, and Mission Impossible 3, but I fell in love with Tom Cruise watching 'Jerry Maguire.' I can't imagine Jerry Maguire, acted by a different actor. Tom Cruise was totally Jerry Maguire in this movie. I really hope Tom would star in this kind of great drama movies again. Renee Zellweger was awesome, too. Jerry: I love you.. You..Complete me.

This masterpiece changed my life as it caused me to be successive in life as Jerry Maguire did. Today maybe i couldn't be successive in life and wouldn't have had a job but i did by modelling Jerry guy. I owe much to this movie. I've seen it 7 times in cinema and bought its CD when there were no DVD's at those times the movie relased. The movie is life's itself. So there is nothing i can say more.

Partly because it says all that should be said about love without ever becoming ""romantic"" and secondly because I saw a lot of myself in Jerry Maguire. No, I am not sleeping with a Kelly Preston lookalike, and neither am I in sports entertainment. I saw a guy lose everything he thought was his world and find everything he never had when all else seemed lost. I thinCuba Gooding delivered the performance of a life-time. I have never seen him more in character, before and since. The casting was excellent and the movie feels 'real' and people who have never watched it and have heard me talk about it have been surprised at just how good it is when they actually see it.",Jerry Maguire
271,GilbertAlmond42,An amazing film,8,19 April 2006,"I refused to see Jerry Maguire for several years, assuming it was a cheap movie about money, sports and sex. When i finally watched it on TV, i was blown away. This movie is about hope, redemption, love, and finding out the meaning of life. Tom Cruise does a spectacular job playing someone with nothing to loose, and Cuba Gooding's performance brought tears to my eyes. Renee Zellweger fits perfectly by having great chemistry with Jerry, and by having a normal, plain look. This film works because it's so real and easily plausible; its a witty, romantic drama more than a romantic comedy that proves its never too late to start over or take a risk.",Jerry Maguire
272,williampadgett,Add a thrill to your personal life.,10,25 April 2006,"This was a life changing movie for me. While I was disgusted by the first sex scene and the overuse of strong vulgar language in places; I rediscovered what I had lost in my own life. A relationship with that one who is my life time companion needs to be much more than just an existence of being polite to one another. The thought of completing one another just sent thrills up my spine. As a result of this movie, I have been getting deeply involved in her world and her. I didn't tell her about the movie or my motives. She has responded to this new romancing by moving so much closer to me. I have rediscovered that girl that took my heart some years ago But the story line is not only one of romance. I loved the logic in the movie! Watch for a theme of heart in work but not in personal relationships set against the theme of heart in relationship but not in work. Watch for the theme of one lover interested in only herself and her goals while another lover is interested in the loved one's goals. Watch how the loved one responds to each manifestation of each lover's view of him. Tom Cruise's dynamite control over audiences comes out strongly in several situations where he uses, as in every movie I've watched him, his Harvard lawyer alter ego. This added dimension of intellect is what I like most about Tom Cruise. You see him play ""thinking on his feet"" so well. This sets Tom Cruise over all the other actors. He looks sharp and greatly intelligent without the appearance of being an egghead. The scenes in which he refutes illogic statements and takes command of a living room both with one person or with a whole group are a reminiscent shadow of his brilliant performance in ""A Few Good Men"". Renee Zellweger's performance was spectacular. I didn't know she existed until now, but I will be sure to watch for her in the future movies that I watch. I also greatly enjoyed Cuba Gooding, Jr.'s portrayal of Rod Tidwell as a warm, but explosively tough football player. I have watched and will watch this movie over and over. I recommend this movie highly to all movie watchers who want to add an extra thrill in their own personal lives.",Jerry Maguire

274,Quentin Tarantino,A beautiful tale of true human emotions.,10,3 February 2002,"I remember watching Jerry Maguire and being stunned by what I was seeing. The film's premise is a sharply real one which reminds us all of times in our own lives.  Many moments in the film portray events that happen to real people and not a glamourised sugar coated image of life as seen by a Hollywood producer.  The film is clever and touching as well as being made in a highly sophisticated style which after being broken up reveals much more than a simple love story.  The emotions shown are depicted with accuracy and confidence to such an extent that at points you actually forget you are watching a film and you become part of the universe which Cameron Crowe has skilfully created.  These reasons and many more which are too long to place on paper are why I believe this is the greatest film ever made, I urge you to attempt watching it.",Jerry Maguire

Not since ''American Beauty'' has a film managed to touch me in such a gentle and profound way. While ''Jerry Maguire'' may be the Hollywood fabrication of real life, the brilliant Cameron Crowe is there to insure that it doesn't fall and squirm in the trash can which is usually the case with Hollywood romances. ''Jerry Maguire'' packs even more heart than Crowe's earlier film ''Say Anything...'' and even more attitude than ''Almost Famous''. It's one movie that won't make you go back to the box-office and demand ''Show me the money''.",Jerry Maguire
276,mroh1235@aol.com,amazing,10,14 August 2005,"this movie rocks. i first saw it when i was maybe 12, and i liked it, but didn't really get it. i am now 17 and have seen it about 3 times in the past month. it is amazing. it has everything a movie could want. it has comedy, Cuba's character is pretty funny and sarcastic, it has unintentional comedy just because it is tom cruise and he is clinically insane so it is funny, and the fact that it is the only movie where Renee Zelwegger didn't gain 50 lbs to perform, which makes it a classic in its own right. how can you argue with a movie where they feature a line about ""shoplifting pootie""? in addition to the comedy it is also an incredibly sweet movie with a seemingly doomed relationship struggles through hardship to eventually succeed, and who doesn't like a good success story? (it happens twice, the relationship and the business succeed)it also has some awesome cameos: Mel Kiper Jr, troy Aikman, Al Michaels, and of course Jay Mohr in his typical jerk character. just to get a sense of how good it is, i put it on at 3:30 in the morning with my friend the other day, because we simply needed to watch it. anyone who says cruise doesn't put on a good performance is a gosh darn liar, and i would be willing to bet their pants are on fire.",Jerry Maguire

278,deadpool2008,"Cheesy, contrived, bloated...but I love it",10,24 September 2011,"I've seen Jerry Maguire a number of times but it was only on my most recent viewing, at the age of 23, that I came to truly appreciate it. Yes it is all the things I described in the title; but it is also a charming and original film filled with excellent performances, under the control of a man who knows exactly what story he wants to tell. I'm not going to tell everyone it doesn't have its flaws- I can picture Crowe sitting there and smiling to himself after writing ""You had me at hello""- but this is anything but a bad film. Jerry Maguire features an unusual central romance, with Cruise and Zellweger's characters getting together more out of convenience than love (on his part anyway). The relationship is handled with maturity and honesty by all involved. Cruise is terrific throughout the whole film but it is his moments with Zellweger and her character's son where he truly shines. Zellweger herself, oft maligned, also puts in a great performance and in my opinion she has never looked lovelier. But it is the relationship between Cruise's Maguire and Oscar winning Cuba Gooding Jr's Rod Tidwell that is the film's real selling point. It's a relationship built on loyalty, trust and friendship. The film has its twists and turns (and it is too long) but it is the bond between agent and star that keeps the film afloat and ultimately gives it a happy ending.Oscar Note: I don't know what the reaction was like at the time but popular opinion nowadays is that Gooding didn't deserve the Oscar. Bill Macy and Ed Norton are often cited as being robbed, and I can't deny that they were excellent in their respective roles, but I believe Gooding to be more than worthy. You'd be hard pressed to find a more electric, entertaining and effective performance in any film.",Jerry Maguire

My input for what it was worth really is to do with the casting of Jonathan Lipniki. Simply put, I thought he was outstanding. He really added some beautiful moments to the film and I only wish they could have cast him more. Sadly due to his very tender age and stamina levels at the time, they had to keep his cameo's short and to when he was at his best. But it was a lovely film all round, I loved how the characters evolved but for me it was held together by Ray. I can watch his parts over and over.

283,rob_kubiak,Why I Love to Hate Cameron Crowe,6,25 March 2008,"Sitting alone in my living room on the sunny, yet frigid eve of Easter Sunday 2008 amidst six inches of snow that was dumped upon the Chicagoland suburbs the day before. Fueled by nicotine and caffeine I found myself straightening up my apartment and channel surfing when I happened upon an early morning screening of Jerry Maguire on TNT. That's right Jerry Ma-freakin-Guire. I found myself completely and utterly intrigued and drawn in despite the fact that I've seen this movie somewhere in the vicinity of 10-20 times before, typically on random weekend days on basic cable. First things first, I HATE, capital H through E, Renee Zelwegger and the charm of Tom Cruise died for me somewhere between Top Gun and his ill-conceived notion to pick up where L. Ron Hubbard left off on the proliferation of Scientology tip. And don't sleep on little Jonathon Lipnnicky, the cute little over-sized glasses wearing son of Zelwegger's character in the film, speaking of which, has he gotten arrested for marijuana/cocaine possession yet or fallen into the child-star trap yet? As I digress.Anyway, without even realizing it  it happened  the film had my undivided attention and I became emotionally invested in the subtle intricacies of the dialogue and was provoked to the point of inspiration, which in my humble opinion is truly one of the greatest pleasures on Earthbut to arrive at this point watching Jerry Maguire? What was wrong with me  had I become a softy in my late 20s? I even found myself getting the chills and near-tearing up as the relationship between Jerry (played by Cruise) and Rod Tidwell (Oscar winning performance by Cuba Gooding Jr.) progressed and Jerry left himself emotionally vulnerable, which apparently is atypical of your big shot sports agent in this day and age, only to win back his wife Dorothy (played by Zelwegger) with one of the more memorable lines in recent film history  'you had me at hello'.I then began realizing that despite my anti-Hollywood, screw all major studio releases attitude cultivated sometime between my junior year of high school and becoming a film studies major during my college days in Madison, WI, I did not hate Columbia TriStar or Cruise or Zelwegger or even Cuba (Gooding Jr.  not the home of Fidel Castro people). My hate was centered on Cameron Crowe, the only man with the verbiage and directorial skills to make me give a rat's arse about a movie like Jerry Maguire. The relate-ability of every facet of every relationship and every exchange between these actors that I truly love to hate is so deceivingly obvious and spot-on that I can't help but succumb to the magnetism and emotion of the scenes as they play out. I'm still watching the film and having this epiphany and rather than admit that it's the film I enjoy, I start shaking my head in disbelief amidst teary eyes and thrust all of the recognition and responsibility for the way I'm feeling on Mr. Crowe. I feel vindicated in doing so rather than chalk Jerry Maguire up as another guilty pleasure of mine, kind of like the Hanson song MMMBop. It's then that I decided I needed to write this, if not for the therapeutic function that it's currently providing me, but more so because I feel I owe it to Mr. Crowe.I'm a proud purveyor of classics like Fast Times at Ridgemont High (granted Amy Heckerling directed it), Say Anything and Almost Famous. I'm still trying to be half the man Lloyd Dobbler was in courting (pun intended) Diane Court and churning out 'In Your Eyes' through his ghetto blaster and longed to have experienced the 70s rock scene like William Miller in Almost Famous. Those films equally capture me emotionally, spiritually, have terrific soundtracks and when mixed together in only the way Cameron Crowe can - they inspire me to believe that possibilities are limitless and that anything can happen and eventually, will happen. And when they do, they'll inevitably involve me getting with the perfect girl amidst the backdrop of the perfect song to capture the all-encompassing essence of purity, honesty and lovewhether it is for Diane Court, Stillwater or Dorothy BoydAnd that is why I love to hate, but really just plain admire Mr. Cameron Crowe  or maybe I just enjoy his films. Either way, I think I made my some kind of point, right?",Jerry Maguire

The story of an individual's success after a s*** load of odds is always something that we can connect to in one way or another. I tried to watch this movie in one piece but could never sit through this. It just tests our patience and our intelligence. Like the scene where Jerry realizes and says ""he hated his place in the world"" coz of what he had become ""another shark in a suit"". The scene that made him realize that and the montages that follow through after that lacks even the slightest emotion so one can connect to his change over to what he really wants to be. That's when the titles roll. That's what you get from the rest of the movie. Its like somebody pushing down savor-less food down your throat. The only relief was Jonathan Lipnicki.

That mission statement gets him fired, and changes his life forever. Dorothy Boyd is a single mother, who is an accountant for the company. When Jerry gets fired, she leaves the job with him. After Jerry gets fired, he is only left with one client. This clients name is Ron Tidwell. Dorothy and Ron make Jerry a better person. This movie provided many touching moments, and had a lot of laughs. This movie basically kicked off Zellwegger's career, and it is a movie which in my book is a must see.",Jerry Maguire
294,dmoore-221-76699,Top 5 worst movie of all time.,1,24 January 2015,"I saw this horrible movie in 1996 in the theater. Now I can finally have a place to vent. I was watching this stupid movie with Zac Effron called ""That Awkward Moment"". Really horrible but in the movie the main characters said Jerry McGuire was one of the best movies of all time. This is clearly Hollywood elite propaganda. The plot makes no sense. Who cares if Ken Griffey Jr catches a TD pass for the worst team in the NFL? Rene Zelwigger was also horrible in this movie. One of the worst phrases of all time came out of this movie. ""You complete me."" Makes me want to vomit. Tom Cruise is a horrible actor and has absolutely zero charisma in this role making it impossible to identify with his character.. It's mellow dramatic to the extreme. I want my $6 back. I think there is only one movie that is worse than this. Contact with Jodie foster. It's nearly as horrible. Anyways back to Jerry McGuire. Do not watch this film.",Jerry Maguire
295,annalee-83283,"Fast paced, terrific performances",9,9 November 2021,You root for Tom Cruise's character from start to finish. Cubs Gooding and Renee Zellwegger provide sterling support and match Cruises energy and commitment. This is a hugely entertaining roller coaster of a ride.,Jerry Maguire
296,philfranklin-67138,One great movie,9,23 November 2015,"Cruz has never been better. The character Jerry Maguire is developing on two levels, both based on connecting to another person and finally understanding the concept of loyalty witch Jerry has constantly talked about but never really understood. Cruise and Zellweger characters are perfectly complementary, his hastiness, her emotional side, their shared optimism and confusion were the main combination of their success. Cameron Crowe has a perfect career, every next film picks up where the previous one left off, raising the level of quality over its expected size. One thing is certain, ""Jerry Maguire,"" has enough emotional drive to fall in love with but a deeper context which we are constantly given will be the reason why you will appreciate it.",Jerry Maguire
297,sk-35464,thoroughly entertaining...,8,27 January 2017,"I am big fan of tom cruise n i have watched most of his movies n all r entertaining, but Jerry is that kind of movie which not only entertains you but also makes you feel good. Tom cruise was the perfect choice for jerry maguire, i can't think of any actor in that role,, tom cruise is always considered as the best good looking actor who he is but , but i like him for his acting,, his acting in this movie is so believable, funny , goofy and whenever he shouts, yells , in movie not only entertains cuba gooding jr. but us also. i had always watched tom cruise as an action star before watching jerry maguire cuz i watched this movie 20 yr later its release. he should have gotten an Oscar award for this movie, which he really deserved. the other cast of movie were very good. cuba gooding is funny at times. the coordination between him n tom cruise in this movie is so good that it makes you feel like you are watching real people talking. renee zellweger is also quite good in her role, the screenplay is very entertaining n doesn't make u feel bored , the cinematography, dialogues, Direction of cameron crowe. Cameron crowe is a great director and whenever he n tom cruise works together its,they always bring good movies....",Jerry Maguire
298,giturra-1,phony-hypocritical-deceiving and corny,1,16 December 2005,"Fast Times at ridgemont high is to this day one of my favorite movies, I respected Cameron Crowe for that movie, but lately he's become the ultimate hack, his movies are disgusting, specially Jerry Maguire which I saw years ago and I still haven't gotten ridden of the nausea it provoked me. C'mon!!!, can anyone take the message of this movie seriously!!!! One of the messages of the movie is that love is more important than money, but a the end is all about the money, I mean, if the movie does not seem contradictory to you, well... I guess that people are willing to swallow any kind of trash, and even think that the movie had a MESSAGE.... On top of that Cuba gooding Jr, is despicable in this film, sooo over the top, his character is both unlikable and so stupid, so is the part of R, Zellwegger, not to mention the kid who is one of the reasons why abortion should ALWAYS be legal. False, pretentious, corny, cheesy, I felt used and abused by the filmmakers who may think that we're all a bunch of idiots! I won't discuss Tom cruise in this movie, just because he's not the biggest problem on this movie, is the cynicism of a script, that wants to sound deep while actually being one of the shallowest movies ever. I mean if you have a brain and a heart in the right place you just can't like this aberration of a film. Sorry to all the people that liked it, but in all honesty, if you watch the movie with a bit of a critical eye, you just can't help to feel manipulated and sacked, try and see it again, if your'e honest, at least you'll recognize, that this corny sentimentalism is very much planned, no auteur here, but a bunch of movie executives, trying to make us feel sorry for a bunch of wealthy, unlikable and ridiculous characters. One of the worst movie ever! I can't believe that so many people took this movie seriously and that even more people haven't been able to call this movie what it is> TRASH",Jerry Maguire
299,grace007,"Cry, Laugh, Cry, Laugh!",9,29 December 2005,"I recently saw this film with my brother, and was completely transfixed! It is so amazing! I think Tom Cruise was fantastic in this film, as was Renee, and I thoroughly enjoyed it. It had me crying and laughing and the sport factor really introduces baseball fans into this film. Also, Tom Cruise is SO good looking that you can understand why she is in love with him! Anyone who watches this film should feel instantly happy, no matter how bad their day was! I strongly recommend this film to everyone, because it is just right for anyone!If this film does not sound like your piece-of-cake or cup-of-tea, I promise you you WILL enjoy it! I always think 'Oh I won't enjoy this film' to about 80% of the films I watch and then I always enjoy them! (well, about 5% I don't!} and I watch A lot of films!As the film gets towards the end, you really feel emotion, especially when he says 'I love you. I miss my Wife.' and thats when you really know you feel strongly about this film, because he actually then realises he LOVES her and not the child, Jay. There are some boring scenes which is why I only rated it 9, like when they are kissing it lasts about 5 minutes and is quite boring after a while!",Jerry Maguire
300,jodiecatherine,What a film!,10,20 January 2007,"This movie had me crying, laughing, praying and totally getting lost in the world of sport. Tom Cruise acts his butt off in this movie!!! Renee portrays the single mum looking for love superbly!! One of my favourite films of all time! Cuba shows the kind of dedication to a sport that all sportsmen should show. That is what sport is about. I f you show dedication and determination in what you do you will always succeed. I wish Bonnie Hunt could of had a bigger part, and even though i felt i did not see enough of the fabulous actress, i think she played her character very well! A little note to Tom, if you want to get some respect back, do more films like this as you are without a doubt the best actor in the world.xxx",Jerry Maguire
301,nepolean0415,It Completes Me!,10,4 February 2006,"I recently saw this movie and I loved it. I was so good! I cried, I laughed. It has the perfect balance of sad and funny. This is the best movie ever. I didn't think this movie would be good, I thought it would just be some kinky chick-flick. I was wrong. The actors are great. I don't personally like Renee Zellweger, but I think she did a great job. As always Cuba Gooding Jr. was great. Tom Curise isn't a favorite of mine either, but I think this is the best movie he has done yet, much better than any Mission Impossible. This is the perfect movie to watch when you are depressed, or when you aren't. It is also a great movie to watch with a bunch of girl-friends, or even your boyfriend.What can I say? It completes me!",Jerry Maguire
