0,kosmasp,Making things ... appear,9,22 June 2017,"Have you seen the movie ""Body""? The one that was made before that. It's a great movie and was just an exercise if you will or training session for this one. A much bigger scope, a constant guessing game and tension that is filled to much, that it almost burst through the screen. The characters are well drawn and this does warrant repeated viewing, just so you know what you might have missed.Story wise I will not tell you anything other than it's about a murder. A ""whodunnit"" as they like to say. It's best watching this with as little pre-information as possible. Just let the movie work its magic on you. And it will be really good magic it has to offer, if thrillers are your thing that is of course",The Invisible Guest
1,classicsoncall,"""There'll be no salvation without suffering, and you're not smarter than I am.""",10,12 April 2020,"This was a cleverly written murder mystery that gets better with each new revelation by the accused, Adrian Doria (Mario Casas). When it starts out one can follow the story easily enough, but when retired legal counselor Virginia Goodman (Ana Wagener) arrives to prepare him for his defense testimony, a number of scenarios are presented to the viewer that are designed to question what, if anything is true. Hidden motives and questionable conduct come into play, and it can get a little hard to follow, but when the twist ending occurs, you realize than any of the alternate theories put forth by Adrian and Goodman become moot. I don't want to give it away, because the thrill is in the viewing and trying to figure out where the picture is going. Because this is a Spanish film, it's not surprising that it wasn't on many viewers' radar when it was released in 2016, but with a wider audience and kudos offered by IMDb viewers, it now makes the Top 250 list, and similar to Korean Oscar Winner ""Parasite"", I wouldn't be surprised if the film continues an upward climb in the viewer ratings. Once you've seen it, you'll probably give it a nudge yourself.",The Invisible Guest

3,blanche-2,a wow of a movie,10,10 May 2021,"I can only say about this film: OMG.This is a Spanish film starring Mario Casas and Ana Wagener,I have to say, I figured out the big twist but there are plenty of twists to go around.A well-known Steve Jobs type (Casas), married with a young daughter, is having an affair with a photographer (Barbara Lennie). He has told his family he is going to Paris; instead, he has a rendezvous with her. On their way back home, they are in a car accident. The young man (Inigo Gastesi) in the other car seems to be dead.I am going to leave it there and just say if you like this kind of thriller, this is a MUST SEE.

4,grantss,Intriguing thriller,7,21 January 2021,"A successful young businessman is accused of murdering his girlfriend. He hires a top-rate lawyer to defend him. She senses that he is not providing the full picture and questions him on the background to the murder, in particular an incident that occurred to the two of them a few months earlier.Intriguing Spanish drama. Decent, suspenseful plot with a great twist. Quite engaging as we see the full picture emerge.Not brilliant though. The best thrillers keep the twists to minimum, to lull you into a false sense of security, and then hit you with a massive twist at the end (e.g. The Usual Suspects). The Invisible Guest seems to have a twist every 5 seconds they come so thick and fast. This means that when the ultimate twist comes it's not a shock as you've become accustomed to them.The rapidly changing narrative also means you're hardly had time to digest the latest version of the chain of events before the next change comes, making it hard to figure out how the new change to the story fits in.The plot isn't completely watertight either, and sometimes feels contrived, largely as a result of the twists-for-twists-sake narrative.That said, it's an entertaining, thrilling roller-coaster of a ride.",The Invisible Guest
5,gridoon2021,Another splendid thriller from Oriol Paulo,8,21 September 2017,"Another awesome mystery-thriller from the writer-director of ""El Cuerpo"". Oriol Paulo has become an official guarantee for a top Spanish thriller - I just hope it doesn't take him another 4 years to make his next film! With Hitchcockian moments (the blood dripping from the car....), escalating tension, and a constant stream of twists & reversals, ""Contratiempo"" is thoroughly engrossing viewing. The final twist is of the best kind: it absolutely floors you, AND makes you want to kick yourself for missing it at the same time. A must-see if you like the genre. *** out of 4.",The Invisible Guest
6,deloudelouvain,Another good Spanish mystery movie,8,2 May 2017,"I'm not very familiar with all the Spanish actors and actresses but I'm sure the ones in this movie must be the better ones from Spain. Because the acting is really good in Contratiempo or The Invisible Guest. The story is everything you want when you want to watch a mystery crime thriller. It's never boring, with plenty of twists and turns. All you want to do is know how this story will end. It keeps your attention from the first second till the last one. I saw plenty of Spanish movies and some are really good, way above average. This one is definitely one of the good ones. If you look for a good entertaining mystery movie search no further and watch The Invisible Guest. You won't regret it.",The Invisible Guest
7,lasttimeisaw,a perspicacious morality caution tale,8,6 April 2017,"The second feature film of Spanish writer/director Oriol Paulo, THE INVISIBLE GUEST is an entrancing whodunit opening with a straightforward frame story where a young and successful businessman Adrián Doria (Casas), embroiled in the mysterious murder of his mistress Laura Vidal (Lennie), meets Virginia Goodman (Wagener), a silver-haired defendant lawyer, who arrives earlier than their appointed time in his penthouse apartment to discuss the case owing to the impending surface of a new witness.Hard-nosed and cut-to-the-chase, Virginia browbeats an evasive Adrián to lay bare the truth to her so that she can bail him out, this is her last case before retirement and she will not allow it to taint her impeccable winning streak (never lose one single case before). So here goes Adrián's story: it all starts three months earlier, there is a road accident during Adrián and Laura's covert assignation, a young man Daniel (Gastesi) is killed (don't text when you are behind the wheel and strap that damn safety belt!), although technically it is not their fault, but for fear that calling police would expose their affair, they decide to cover it up. Adrián goes alone to dispose of Daniel's body and vehicle, whilst Laura is in Adrián's stalled car, and later meets Tomás (Coronado), an automobile engineer lives nearby (sheer luck!!), who is more than willing to help her out. But soon Laura discovers a shivering truth that shatters her to the core when she arrives at Tomás' and meets the latter's cancer-ridden-but-hearty wife Elvira, guess who is their son?Both Adrián and Laura agree to sever their ties completely in the aftermath, but a blackmail brings them together in a remote hotel (later the plot reveals that Elvira works there), where Adrián claims to be knocked out by an unknown attacker and when he wakes up minutes later, Laura is dead, yet the killer just vanishes from the thin air because there is no trace of break-in-or-out in a room locked from inside. Under Virginia's lawyer-smart suggestion and postulation, the narrative pans out like a RASHOMON-esque jigsaw, details are being reshuffled and reconstructed to tally with various possibilities, to make Adrián look innocent against all odds, meanwhile, it is also a mind- game between Virginia and Adrián, since the former has to milk the truth out of the latter by earning his trust, yet, can he trust her 100%? At one point, Virginia almost loses her professional dispassion when Adrián reveals another twist which would change the essence of the crime forever (whenever a deer pops up, it heralds a test of his morality), is she too much invested in the case, or is there a hidden agenda behind? Or, a more tantalizing question, who is she?First of all (spoils alert!), Ana Wagener is masterfully Janus-faced in her dichotomous roles, even genre-savvy viewers are dangled to the possibility that the two characters might be played by the same actor, their sheer disparities between appearance, utterance and temperament can often successfully disabuse that idea before it being nudged again when the plot thickens, which leaves the final make-up removing revelation more inclined to a compelling justice-is-served stimulation than a complete shock. Mario Casas, dutifully downplays Adrián's boundless selfishness and understated wiles, often brings about an innocent air of apathy when he can casually shift the responsibility to the one who is pushing up daisies, his golden-boy look effectively leaves the first impression of ingenuousness, a camouflage of his rotten core underneath. Bárbara Lennie, also competently jumps between two different modes of personalities (scheming/perturbed) apropos of the raconteurs' motives.Substantially, THE INVISIBLE GUEST has some glaring plot holes (e.g. what about the blood dripping from the car in the accident scene, that must be traceable even if Adrián and Laura have tried to cleanse it, which the plot fails to mention, how come the police never find that out?), and sometimes, the tug-of-war verbal fencing loses its momentum due to the repetition and over- simplification of the revelations and their collateral damages, but, at any rate it is a commendable thriller buttressed by a perspicacious morality caution tale hitting the right mark, a stunner of storytelling with editing job par excellence (from Jaume Martí), and a capable cast too.",The Invisible Guest

The subtitles will be on the test.If not so incredibly predictable, I would've loved this movie all the more. And maybe it's not the movie, as it's that I've seen enough of these scripts to at least get the WHODUNIT resolved in the 1st act.But, if you're a novice, watch this well-made, acted and tense twisty twister of suspense with an open spirit and enjoy.",The Invisible Guest
9,Pjtaylor-96-138044,History is written by the victors.,7,7 September 2020,"'The Invisible Guest (2016)' essentially plays around with the nature of truth, retelling the same events from slightly different perspectives to slowly unveil new information that may or may not be totally accurate. With its retrospective framing, the flick is able to funnel all of its events through the lens of its characters, who each have their own agendas and, as such, can't quite be trusted. This isn't immediately obvious; instead, the picture plays around with our expectations to deliver its small yet potent subversions. It's a really entertaining time that manages to keep you guessing throughout. It's engaging and well-conceived. It is also, however, somewhat forgettable. Once its ending occurs, there's very little left to ponder. While that does make for a potentially more satisfying conclusion, I feel that some ambiguity would have gone a long way in making the movie more memorable. However, it's a distinct choice and the picture's last few moments certainly don't disappoint. 7/10",The Invisible Guest

11,851222,Pure Detective Movie Masterpiece,10,18 February 2021,"Greetings from Lithuania.As a one who has seen and kinda enjoyed ""Knives Out"", I was blown away by ""Contratiempo"" - a masterpiece detective story made in Spain. I did not knew anything about this movie prior seeing it - only that it was a drama / thriller and it was on IMDb 250 list. After seeing it I can only say this - watch this gem if you have at least a small spot in your heart for Agatha Christie's works - and i believe that everyone has at least a bit of it. This picture puts all fancy Hollywood detective stories seen in years to a shame. This movie is a pure detective driven story heaven.""Contratiempo"" is like ""Knives Out"" but 100 times better because of its focus on story and because it is stripped away with all off fancy and eccentric characters who belonged more in a cartoon then in real life - ""Contratiempo"" is a pure detective. But made with such a breathtaking pacing and a skill in writing, directing, editing and acting that it makes its running time 1 h 40 min simply disappear - i was caught into this movie from its opening till closing titles - you hardly can get better then this.Overall, ""Contratiempo"" is a simple yet such a skillfully done detective movie that sucks you in from a get go and never lets you off its hook. And the ending is a kind reminder of why ""The Usual Suspects"" was such a memorable story. I can't recommend this movie any higher.",The Invisible Guest
12,briancham1994,Mind-blowing thriller,8,11 July 2021,"Along the lines of other crafty films like Shutter Island, this film is a carefully plotted masterwork with interweaving alternative narratives. What is really going on? Who was responsible for what actions? The many alternative flashbacks show the subjective construction of the past with fantastic acting as every character is shown in completely different roles simultaneously. The audience is left on the edge of their seat with every new revelation until the ultimate finale. The only problem is the glaring plot holes which are described in the goofs section of this IMDb page. Otherwise I would have given it much higher!",The Invisible Guest
13,Thanos_Alfie,Unexpected...,8,7 December 2018,"""The Invisible Guest"" is a Mystery - Thriller movie in which we watch a wealthy businessman who is also named Man of the Year due to his high-tech company being prepared from a veteran lawyer expert in witness preparation and judicial declaration to create a very strong defense. He has to do that because he was found by the police in a mountain hotel room with the corpse of his lover and was arrested. After that, he has to reveal all of his dark secrets to his lawyer in order for her to be able to help him.I liked this movie very much because it had an amazing plot with many surprises and many plot twists too. The direction which was made by Oriol Paulo was absolutely perfect and I wouldn't change anything about it, it had plenty of suspense and drama moments. Regarding the interpretations, I liked very much the interpretation of Mario Casas who played as Adrián Doria the wealthy and successful businessman and I have to say that he was the biggest surprise in this movie. Other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Bárbara Lennie's who played as Laura Vidal and of course Ana Wagener's who played as Virginia Goodman.Finally, I have to say that ""The Invisible Guest"" was a very big surprise because I didn't expect it to be such a great movie. I strongly recommend everyone to watch this movie either you are a fan of mystery movies or not because I am sure that you are going to enjoy it very much. It's an unexpected movie with many surprises and plot twists that will leave you speechless.",The Invisible Guest
14,eddie_baggins,Not a Top 250 movie but still a fun and engaging thriller,6,27 January 2021,"When you browse the IMDB Top 250 film list, a list many film lovers use when researching or debating the supposed ""best films"" ever, there's one film that regularly keeps popping up in a list filled with the likes of undisputed classics like The Godfather, The Shawshank Redemption or The Dark Knight, and that film is Spanish thriller The Invisible Guest.Available for our viewing pleasures courtesy of Netflix, Guest was a film that initially received solid if unremarkable critical ratings on release to go alongside a decent box office haul off a minimal budget but in the years that have now followed on since its 2016 release timeframe, director Oriol Paulo's work has gained more and more traction across the globe.Put simply, the film is certainly not one you could strongly argue deserves a place in a list like the IMDB Top 250 but its a fun thriller, one that does the job of a Saturday night filler perfectly and its a universal story of intrigue, misdirection and a serious case of the whodunnits that has already seen various redoing's in other markets such as India and is destined to land in a Hollywood studio at a not to distant point.You will need to throw away your hard questionings of characters motivations and some highly unlikely situations to get full enjoyment out of Paulo's at times extremely over the top affair but if you're willing to check your brain at the door and allow the film some moments of grace and leeway, Guest will hook you from start to finish as you end up at a finale that perhaps isn't as shocking as it could've been despite many proclaiming its ""twist"" as a significant genre moment from the last few cinematic years.Most things in Guest outside of its twisting, turning and constantly moving narrative aren't overly original, much of the film feels familiar in parts both story wise and delivery wise while many of the performances from the films cast don't convey too much of note but as a high-end TV like product that will provide viewers with an adrenaline rush of thriller fills, Guest does it's job as well as one could've hoped for.Final Say -Not a Top 250 movie of all time experience, The Invisible Guest is still an enjoyable genre ride and one that is likely to see the light of day very soon in a newly minted Hollywood sheen.3 lawyers notes out of 5",The Invisible Guest

16,SAMTHEBESTEST,Spanish Cinema releases a Detailed Study Material for Thriller Genre..,8,11 July 2020,"The Invisible Guest (2016) :Spanish Cinema releases a Detailed Study Material for Thriller Genre. Do you know the only thing Hitchcock thrillers lacked? The answer i believe is the details, and showing them even before you unfold the real thrill. You show the details even before starting to unfold the mystery and then the same details appear again just to make you realise that how you overlooked them in the first place. The Invisible Guest is a complete and a detailed study material for thriller lovers. It shows how to add sense in the thriller and just not letting it get away without human emotions. I have seen many mysterious films having revenge theory involve just because it should justify the overall plot and the Revenge should look mandatory. And it works because the culprit must be punished as we all believe. The Invisible Guest is about parents Revenge against a rich freak who got away using his powers. They plan a thrilling revenge to destroy him and then film keeps revealing shocking facts which were hidden since forever. In 106 minutes this film lacks loo breaks, it lacks loopholes (except for one or two emotional ones), it lacks slow pace and i hope you're getting what I'm trying to say non-affirmatively. It has everything set up nicely and most importantly clearly because cleverness is essential in modern thrillers otherwise we have option of lot of retro classics to enjoy on repeat mode. Spanish Cinema shows how to make a mind boggling thriller with implausible storyline to the world cinema. I have seen better revenge dramas, even more brutal than this but that doesn't take away anything from this film's status. The Invisible Guest triumphs in every cinematic aspect whether is it Acting, Writing, Technicality, Direction or Impact. A Classic thriller which should be remade again and again.RATING - 8/10*",The Invisible Guest

18,jtindahouse,Impossible to fault,10,8 May 2017,"I'm widely known for enjoying French cinema, however I believe this is the first Spanish film I have ever seen. I'm glad to confirm that it will not be my last, because this movie was incredible. It was the type of film that I like more than any other type. A mystery thriller that is guaranteed to have a twist. It's also a type of movie that Americans don't do overly well. They always seem to think that a movie needs endless car chases and shoot-outs and that the story should just be there to facilitate those. The Europeans seem to understand that the true brilliance in cinema comes from the writing side of things. The intricate webs they weave never cease to astound me.It's always a little hard to judge acting in a subtitled film, but I'm pretty confident in saying the acting in this film was superb. The entire cast found a perfect balance of charisma and mysteriousness to surround their character. The story is crafted exquisitely and has a lot of rewatchability factor. In fact it's almost a must to watch it again, knowing what you now know. I love films that do that.It's very hard to find any negatives with this film. In fact I've just spent 5 minutes trying to come up with some and failed. That should indicate just how good this movie is.

It is 'how' the story is told herein which makes it even more interesting. There have been hardly any good thrillers or horrors in recent times. The entire film industry seems to only concentrate on superhero, sci-fi or romcom dramas.The Invisible Guest starts off slow and then quickly picks up pace as all the pieces of the puzzle are slowly laid out and put together. While it isn't perfect by any means, it is an excellent and even emotional mystery drama at times.You could easily make a ten episode TV Series with this in the vein of True Detective and therefore it gets a solid 9/10 for delivering the same impact in a running time of under 2 hours.Must watch if you like thrillers.",The Invisible Guest

The film is intelligent and highly suspenseful with an intriguing plot and interesting, unpredictable characters. It follows the classic crime thriller format by keeping the audience guessing throughout, producing some unexpected twists, and slowly building pace and momentum throughout.Those who like their thrillers to be realistic may take issue with some parts of the film as it can be a little far-fetched at times, especially when it comes to the twists. In fairness, it's more easy to overlook some of the less convincing aspects of the plot because the film as a whole is so enjoyable and well-made. 'Contratiempo' is a riveting crime thriller that, while not totally convincing at times, makes up for it with its smart construction and compelling storyline.",The Invisible Guest
34,blott2319-1,Excellent psychological thriller,9,26 October 2020,"I must start off my review of The Invisible Guest by mentioning that this is a movie where I had to pause and rewind frequently. While I have become more adept at reading subtitles and have found many foregin language films enjoyable, this one had dialogue that was coming rapid-fire at times. I kept missing lines, and because it is a mystery, I was afraid of missing anything that might be a vital piece of information. This isn't a detriment to the film, but perhaps a warning for those who also have difficulty with reading subtitles that are only on the screen for a few seconds. Aside from that I was utterly enthralled by The Invisible Guest. The plot is written so well, and is constantly revealing new layers of the story as you go. Perhaps the smartest move they make is having every single flashback scene reflect what is being said, even if there is some falsehood in it. This allows us to revisit key moments from a new perspective when the main character revises his story.It's hard to say much about The Invisible Guest without spoiling things, but I can say that I thought the cast was amazing. There was a lot of emotion that came out in the performances we see here, and Mario Casas was particularly brilliant. He plays a heavily-layered character that is reluctant to put his guard down, so it's intriguing to see the stages he goes through in this film as he is forced to tell the truth. Ana Wagener is the other notable actor in the film. Her determination is perfect for the role, and it was great watching how she was always a step ahead of Casas in every scene. I will say that I started to suspect what is revealed at the very end somewhat early on, but as with all the best mysteries, even when you figure out one piece there is still more to discover. I can't say much more about The Invisible Guest for fear of spoiling things. I would highly recommend that all fans of mystery/thrillers give this movie a try. It was completely satisfying for me.",The Invisible Guest
35,Richie-67-485852,Be My Guest,10,5 July 2017,"This is a movie where when paying attention to every scene the viewer is rewarded with meaningful and purposeful action and dialog not suspecting that all the while something is afoot but what? That's why you stay tuned and glued to the screen not wanting to miss out on what is being acted out or presented. This is the first time I have come across this type of thriller. You see not only does this movie entertain but it also challenges you to take a side and share a point of view that when done is doubted because of the next scene and what takes place. Just when you think you have a reasonable explanation for what is and has taken place, a new fact enters in making you say ""what is going on"" in a good way. At that point, you are wholly committed and don't know that you have been captured and the movie now has you in its grasp. This is quality entertainment. Kudos to the story teller, the director and actors for pulling off a nice memorable movie that you will want to not only discuss but recommend as well. I always watch Netlfix with subtitles because I have learned so much goes on in movies that one may miss and the sub titles make little comments like wind blowing or so & so is speaking or car door slamming enabling the viewer to become intimate with the flick. My wife and I read every line and even rewound a couple of scenes to see if we were ""getting this"". All and all a good, decent ride. Highly recommend sunflower seeds or popcorn so you don't chew your nails to shreds and forget about any and all distractions (cell phone) too. Give this movie your time and it will give you a nice return on that time guaranteed",The Invisible Guest

That's not a problem here.
The other one? They tend to try to look more artistic with longer shots, quieter moments, scenes to flesh out characters that aren't plot related... etc.
Which is great for some genres! But not for thrillers.
Here, they manage to be Hollywood like (really, super normal thriller crimen stuff)... But still surprise us with some things that require great writing (which Europe has).

I have to admit that it starts a bit like a soap opera, slow and a bit cliché, but slowly evolves in terms of story, storytelling and character complexity, becoming very thrilling and interesting. It plays with you multiple times, making you believe something just to destroy it only a couple of sequences later.It's a mind boggling film, with very good actors, a great plot and an excellent finale which I have to say that it is a must see for every movie lover. I'm surprised by the fact that it is not very popular, judging by the quality it presents. Might be because of its language or a bad timing?

A successful business, being accused of murder, hired a defense attorney as both tried to figure out how to win the case.The storytelling was mixed between the conversation and the flashbacks. The majority of the movie was just talking, and still it was an intense thriller because the attorney was trying to figuring out the whole story behind the businessman.After the first half, I was still curious because I wanted to see how this would end. I thought that I was picking up the clues, and had some ideas of how the story would end. Indeed, for most of the second half, there was a lot of twist and turn, and although some were expected, I felt intense and my ears were glued to their words. And when the final twist hit, I probably had the longest gape since the Red Wedding. I was completely fooled.

It's quite possible. Or is it? Haha This film will leave you doubting everything and everyone by the end.It's superbly written and the pacing is phenomenal. There's so much going on in places that you really need to be paying attention. But it's written in such a way, that it sucks you in quickly, so your concentration naturally follows. When the twists start arriving, they each hit you like a tonne of bricks.The performances here are fantastic as well. Mario Casas has become my favourite Spanish actor after previously enjoying him in ""The Photographer of Mauthausen"" too. Some of the film locations were stunning as well.I generally think I'm alright at picking twists or solving these kind of films - but not this one. The incredibly intelligent way it was written kept me hopelessly guessing until the end. Probably not the best choice of film to watch when you're tired or wanting to switch your brain-off.

The complexity of the plot rivals some of my favorite films, such as ""Courage Under Fire"" and ""Basic."" Unfortunately, much of the complexity and plot reversals involve improbable coincidences, which detract from their dramatic impact. The performances are believable, particularly by Wagener and Coronado. However, the central character is depicted as selfish, self-absorbed and remorseless. The film might be stronger if we were to see a positive side to his character. Similarly, we don't see enough of the femme fatale to understand the central character's fascination with her, particularly as we see two widely different perceptions of their relationship. The basic story concerns a murder committed inside a locked room. That mystery is set up very well and believably. The cinematographer successfully sets up a dreary, grey, cold setting. The clothes are grey. The mood is grey. The cars are grey. The only visual element that contrasts is the vivid white hair of one of the characters.",The Invisible Guest

55,quaseprovisorio,"it's good, but a lot of people are fascinated because they only see mainstream hollywood movies - it's the only reason i can find.",7,17 April 2020,"This movie is a tense thriller, well directed and well acted. The first issues i see with it are the same ones i found in oriol paulo's ""el cuerpo"": a whole bunch of flashbacks to tell the story (here they're a bit more justifiable), a lot of twists and turns to trick the viewer some make sense some not that much, and again a car being crashed. I also didn't like much how they introduce the plot in the movie, they needn't to do that in such an obvious way. but anyway, these movies are not very different in form: again he can engage the viewer while the whole movie is almost only based in one location, again the pace is on point - and the views of bierge are pretty stunning.The second problems here...well a lot of ""what ifs"" first of all. He wants to trick us based on possibilities - and that's how he wants to keep you engaged - pretty much by guessing. the movie also requires a bit of suspension of disbelief but i'm kinda fine with that. the main problem is this: he's too focused on the ending that he doesn't care to make one or two narrative holes in order for the sotry to flow. again, i can understand but i don't think the ending is only what really matters in a movie. still it's a fun way to get there.now the ending...it's kinda predictable. ok you might not see it coming directly, but it's not hard to predict the last 10 seconds of the fim. not even the main revelation which is slightly before, but the last 10 seconds. the main problem of a lot of thrillers is that because they don't have that many characters you have to start guessing. that's not a bad thing per se, but since i saw el cuerpo recently i aso thught this one had a trick - i wasn't wrong.contratiempo is a good movie ,that but i dare to say a lot of people that were jawdropped when the finale was revealed probably are the ones discussing inception's ending - when it was pretty obvious nolan just wanted to play with the viewer. there are a lot of filmes where i was pretty stunned by the end - mostly because it makes you see the movie in a different light. this one made that but still i don't think it was thaat surprising.I'm going to give it an eight because it's indeed a good movie and a bit better than el cuerpo. plus it keeps you entertained while not being the best thriller in the world. being in top 250 imdb best movies doesn't make much sense though. i'm still going to see more oriol paulo's movies because get engaged with this type of films - even though this one is pretty much ""el cuerpo"" from another perspective. more believable none the less.",The Invisible Guest

At first, the male owner must feel that he is in charge of the overall situation, guiding the lawyer and guiding her to follow her own ideas!
The fake female lawyer knew what was going on in her heart, and everything happened was clear, but she performed with him.
The male owner thought he was digging a hole for the lawyer, but he didn't expect the lawyer to dig a bigger hole for the male person! The purpose of the lawyer is very clear is to cheat his confession!Why did the male lead put everything out?
Fake female lawyers used several methods to lure confessions
1. Time-pressing method: start to count when you enter, stopwatch ticking ticking. Tell you a three-hour countdown! The man thought: irritability! Mess!
2. Halo method: I have never lost a lawsuit, and all the lawsuits I have won have been won. The male thought: Niu Ren!
3. Transfer the trust method: I was introduced by your cronies. Although we met for the first time, your cronies trusted me! The male master thought: I believe in him, he believes in her, I should believe in her!

7. Fighting hard: If you want to avoid homicide, you have to admit the traffic accident! If you want to blame your mistress, you must tell me the location of the sinking car, so I can fake it! In fact, the purpose is to allow the male owner to admit that he is involved in a traffic accident and tell the location of the sinking car.

66,newjersian,An insult to intelligence,1,8 June 2019,"It's a riddle wrapped in a mystery inside an enigma how this movie got such a high rating.
It doesn't contain goofs. The movie as a whole is one big endless goof. The plot is full of holes so it looks like a fisherman's net. Let's start with the obvious ones.
-The movie begins with Adrian calling his wife and telling her that he's in Paris. His lawyer supposedly falsifies the hotel and flight records (which is highly implausible). However, investigators definitely checked Adrian's home phone record and could easily establish that the call was actually made from Spain. That means the movie ends here.
-Then the investigators find out that the call was made from a hotel where Adrian parked his car. Adrian claims that his car was stolen from the parking lot. Since later Laura drives that car which was serviced by Tomas Garrido, this implies that Laura was the thief?
-Daniel's car didn't hit any obstacle, didn't turn over, the air bags didn't pop up, and its windshield stayed intact. How in the world could Daniel be fatally injured in that accident?
Laura says that his belt was not buckled. But what difference does it make if Daniel's ""corpse"" didn't move an inch from his comfortable position in the driver's seat?
-Just looking at Daniel, Adrian and Laura decide that he is dead. Later Adrian reveals that Daniel was actually very alive. Didn't two lovers mention that Daniel is breathing? Why didn't they check his pulse?
-There was absolutely no sensible justification for getting rid of Daniel's body. The lovers didn't do anything wrong. If they didn't want to reveal their affair, Adrian could just walk away. Anyway Laura stayed alone in his car.
-It is impossible to sink a car in the water by just pushing it from the shore. To do that one needs to push the car from a cliff or a bridge.
-Laura transfers a big amount of money from the bank where Daniel worked. Where the money was transferred to? The investigators could easily check the internet IP address from which the transfer was made. And that would lead them to Laura.
-Adrian pulls out of his account 100,000 euro in cash and in small bills. Any bank in Europe would report it, especially, when the account owner is under investigation as a major suspect in a murder. Police would immediately bring him for interrogation.
-The hotel room where Laura's body was found immediately becomes the crime scene. Anyway, a hotel employee not only enters the crime scene but she also succeeds to lock the window (a critical evidence) in a room filled with police officers.
-The false lawyer Virginia Goodman talks to Adrian for a couple of hours while her face is getting very close to him. She is wearing a silicon mask, and Adrian doesn't mention that? That's childish.

Moreover, the guest was shot by Oriol Paolo, a man who put his hand to such important tapes as ""Enlightenment"" (as a screenwriter) and ""Body"" (as a director and screenwriter).Quite often in Spanish cinema, the action does not immediately gain momentum, but only after a while. This film did not become an exception. Initially, ""Guest"" may seem boring and slightly tightened, but soon enough the story begins to add to the dynamics and does not let the viewer go until the final credits. It is worth noting how well the director builds the narrative, differently presented the same events and deftly manipulating our expectations. The story line perfectly fits the chic atmospheric music.In addition to the script, which is the main advantage of the tape, it is worth mentioning the cast of actors, represented by the colorful and highly sought-after in modern Spanish cinema Mario Casas (""Three meters above the sky"", ""Witches of Sugar-Murdi""), Jose Coronado (""Body"") and Anoy Wachener (""Beauty""). The presence in the frame of recognizable faces, undoubtedly, goes to the film for good.If you are not a connoisseur of the detective genre, or have not seen the previous work of Oriol Paolo, then the film outcome will certainly seem unpredictable and somewhat shocking to you. And those viewers who saw the same ""Body"", for certain will notice a certain similarity of these two pictures and the repetition of the director himself. All this, however, does not cancel the fact that the ""Invisible Guest"" is quite a worthy representative of its genre and at least one viewing deserves it.The invisible guest is a one-time and far from ideal but intriguing and atmospheric psychological detective with elements of a thriller with worthy acting work, an ornate story and worthy final revelation.",The Invisible Guest

Jose Coronado always steal the show since I see him for the first time in another great Spanish thriller, ""El Cuerpo"". For one moment, you think you have all the pieces of the puzzles but the director of this masterpiece persistently change the answers and the questions. By the way, the director and writer of ""Contratiempo"" is the same one of ""El Cuerpo"". That's not a coincidence, Mr. Oriol Paulo can write. If you're a fan of thriller movies and you're having a hard time trying to find a good movie, this is the one. I say it's better that the 85% of the Hollywood thrillers these days.

86,NpMoviez,Underrated. Overlooked.,10,17 April 2021,"It was around mid 2019 (I think) when I heard about this movie. There's a Bollywood movie called ""Badla"" which is a remake of this movie. Later, upon searching on Google for more information about the movie, I came to know about the remakes and all. That's how I heard about The Invisible Guest and after watching it, I haven't watched Badla to this date.""Contratiempo"" is one of those rare films which happened to take a place in my all time favorites, right after the first viewing. The story structure and storytelling are simply top notch. It gave me an unusual vibe of great blending of 12 Angry Men and The Usual Suspects. But, the movie is nothing like those two, except for too non-obvious similarities. The way the story unfolds is really great. This movie thrills you in a loop. You will obviously know what is fake and what is real, but you are still listening to what the characters have to say. The different aspects and the concept of collateral thinking (as suggested in the movie itself), gives you a story and then another and then another. There's a whole lot of tension being built all around the stories being shown in the movie and you won't know what will happen next. Then, after something seems alright, there's another thing ready to mess things up. All of this makes the movie totally unpredictable, which is the main plus point for this movie.The final twist was too awesome. It wasn't something that had not been done before, but was done very well. It gives you a complete satisfaction in the end. Speaking of characters, you are quite misguided. You feel something for one character. Then, it was supposed to be for some other character. But, the way you feel is the same and it is just the characters being switched. The one you sympathize might (or might not) turn out to be really bad. The one you thought was a villainous person might not be all that bad either. These aren't spoilers at all, and I don't want to dive into spoilers for this movie at all. Give it a watch, it's totally worth your time. As a huge fan of crime thrillers and murder mysteries, I was totally satisfied with this movie. This movie gave me more than I needed in a great movie of the said genre.The actors have done a really fantastic job. I won't mention their names, that's because I don't remember their names. I don't even remember the names of their characters. But if I watch it again, I will definitely recognize who is who. And, that's kind of a problem for me. I am an alien to Spanish language. Watching films with subtitles are tedious. An English dubbed version should've been available for such a great movie. Some subtitles changed so fast that I had to rewind the scene many times. That's all the negatives I have for this film.Rating : absolute 10/10, Grade : golden A+",The Invisible Guest

If you're the sort of person who doesn't dig into every finer detail of a movie, then you'll enjoy this as a tense thriller.However there are so many scenes that are blatantly unviable because if the police investigated it the film would end there and then.The ending feels similar to Usual Suspects, but by then you've already guessed what is going to happen and hope somehow that it doesn't.",The Invisible Guest

I love the way they challenge your mind, and I love trying to predict the outcome before ""the big reveal"". But nowadays its just extremely hard to find a truly good detective story; either all of them are filled with clichés, or are too unserious and ""jokey"". But ""The Invisible Guest"" is an overlooked detective masterpiece.One of the few Spanish movies I've seen, it has the grim atmosphere of ""Gone Girl"" and story quality and complexity worthy of Sherlock. I obviously cannot tell much about the plot without spoiling everything to oblivion, but in general it's a story of a man falsely accused of murder, who has only a couple of hours to prove his innocence. The multilayered storyline demands your attention every second, and plot twists will leave you with you mouth wide open. A modern detective story that still manages to stay classy. Highly recommended.",The Invisible Guest
101,SofiCastle,A letdown,6,15 August 2019,"To be honest, judging by the rating here I thought this would be a much better film. Instead, it is pretty predictable (thirty minutes in, it is evident that this is not the real lawyer) and full of plot holes, the most obvious being that if this guy is so powerful to have his lawyer delete his name from the police files, why not call the police right after the accident and just make sure that his wife never finds out. I mean, the accident wasn't his fault so he would probably walk easily, not to mention that the kid wasn't even dead after all (noone thought to check his pulse?).
Other than that, it was adequately made, and ok to watch on a night in, but for anyone that is a little accustomed to crime thrillers it is, unfortunately, pretty bland.",The Invisible Guest

So if you don't want to waste two hours of your life watch the first ten minutes and ask yourself the question ""would any sane person involved in an accident behave in this manner?"".

It feels false and constructed, like you're playing in an escape room rather than watching a believable story. Many of the twists are predictable, and even when the reveals surprise you it elicits more of an eye-roll than a shock.---SPOILERS---Around two thirds of the way through, I noticed that the lawyer looked a lot like the dead kid's mom, and I thought maybe it was her in disguise.

111,MarcoLara,The almost perfect thriller,9,5 September 2017,"Let's admit it. The great generation of great Spaniards actors died with Alfredo Landa. And yes, Javier Bardem can convince you at times, but here comes Penelope Cruz to trash the party. But what made Spaniard actors good was the fact that they knew what they were good act, which is to reflect the society where they grew up. Watch Antonio Banderas in an American action movie and then in an Spanish film and you will understand fully what I am talking about.I would not say that thrillers are something that Spanish is famous for. And yes, I was amazed by ""Los cronocrímenes"", but I place that one on sci/fi, and yes, I loved ""REC"", but again falls under the sci/fi umbrella, and yes, there is a myriad of great Spanish-speaking thrillers (""El secreto de sus ojos"")...but they are not ""made in Spain"". So when you heard about an Spanish thriller made by Spaniards and with Spanish actors...well, I raised my eyebrown but wanted to give it a try.And boy was I glad I did it, and you will, too. I watched mine (as always) in original Spanish with English subtitles and love it. Most of the actors (I will come to that later) were just great, completely believable. The plot, that would made Hitchcock proud, is so open that only at the very end you really know what is going on. You have a story line, a few levels of complexity, and your final twist. What else could you wish for?Well...there are some, minor things, that I could have wished for. I don't like when events on a movie are forced so the actors follow a certain path. Don't worry, I don't do spoilers period, but here I am going to take you to the edge of one to explain what I mean: You cannot go to any decent hotel and check into a room that has been booked by someone else, unless your name is somewhere around there. I know so because sometimes my name has been misspelled by the booking agent in my company and I almost could not use a room booked for me. So when this happens in a movie that does not require for me to suspend disbelief...well, it breaks the spell. And worst still, these are things that could been easily fixed.Then is the actors. It seems that Jose Coronado is some sort of Spanish washed out and flushed Robert DeNiro that recently has been used to add weight to a movie. Coronado has been on great movies, but recently it seems to me he is a bit more than a token to get Spaniards to watch a movie. Same happens here. Mario Casas and Ana Wagener steal the show. The rest are good too, but I felt that Coronado could have done so much more with his role. I felt a missed opportunity there.And the plot, while truly great, could have been even more. It gets predictable towards the end, and it didn't need to be. There were some lines that could have been expanded but didn't, and that would earn the full marks that the main actors so much deserved.But still this is a fantastic movie and, if you love thrillers as much as I do, this one will not disappoint.",The Invisible Guest

This is resolved only in the end.That this film reminds the viewer of the great works of Hitchcock is a tribute to the exceptional skills of writer-director Oriol Paulo.The main actors performed well but particularly Ana Wagener.

I'm truly impressed.",The Invisible Guest

While I was blown away by that one, this one, not quite so.Guessing by all the hype surrounding the movie, I figured this will be a guessing movie, where in the end we have to guess who the culprit is. By doing so, unfortunately I managed to guess the outcome, the possibilities are so limited, it just brought my self to one possibility that turned out to be true.All I have to say to people who are satisfied by seeing this movie is that you should watch The Body instead, because that one is the true work of art.That being said, I'll still be anticipating the next movies the director will offer in the future.",The Invisible Guest
133,Tralequang,"Smart, full of surprises",10,18 April 2020,"This movie starts out slow, but gets better and more gripping as the clock ticks.
The story is simple enough, but the multiple layers of truth and lies complicate it to some extreme extent. This results in an compelling experience, with full of surprises from all sides in the story. When the final twist unfolded, I was much taken aback. However, this shock was well made, with enough foreshadow beforehand.
The acting is convincing, except for the somewhat bland facial expression by the male lead. Since the plot clearly required something else, this shortcoming is likely a fault of the actor.",The Invisible Guest

135,kking-68641,"Enjoyable mostly, but requires a LOT of suspension of disbelief",7,1 March 2020,"Never explains where ordinary people managed to come up with super high-tech spy quality equipment.
Show scenes play out as each character is laying out possible events, only to have another character propose a different series of events which it also plays out for you, so by the end you've seen so many false narratives about what ""might have happened"" it actually becomes difficult to figure out what actually did happen. Not because it was clever, but simply because the truth was buried under a flood of imaginary scenarios that got shown to you as if they were real.
Tries to be super elaborate and clever, and gets a bit muddled. But in spite of that it's an interesting story and fun to try to figure out what really happened.Easy to get caught up in the imaginary ""twists"" but most of those are just made-up scenarios that never really happened as two characters try to manipulate each other into giving up truth. The actual twist doesn't come until the end, and although it's actually not very plausible it was still interesting and surprising (maybe more surprising because of not being very plausible, but still fun to watch.)",The Invisible Guest

This is a great thriller , suspense from the beginning till the end, amazing twists on the plot, the actors are really good and perform well.Everything start with a couple in an adultery relationship, on a weekend getaway everything start to go wrong on their way. It seems no matter what they try to do to cover the last mistake makes everything worst.I recommend to watch this movie, this is one of those movies that you can´t press the pause button, you must keep watching until the end.very good.",The Invisible Guest
137,nellz_nivlecn,My brother thinks he can fooled me. Ha!,7,10 November 2020,"Okay so I watched the invisible guest because my brother told me it was the best plot twist and that I wont see it coming.
Yeah okay so I didnt immediately guessed it but guess what? I noticed that the lady lawyer and the mother are the same person, I mean, how come nobody saw this? I asked my brother about this and he fell silent LOL. And halfway through the movie, you can kinda see the plot twist coming.I rarely venture out of english speaking movie, aside from asian movies, I could count by hand the number of foreign film I've watched before. Last time I watched 365dni and I regret it. But this movie was very good, the structure and the unreliable main character was the selling point here, the way they build the web of lies and the deconstructure of those lies are very compelling. To me, This wasnt a thriller movie, this played out more like a detective movie.
Though from the title 'The Invisible Guest' I thought that this was a horror/ghost movie.
And there are some moments where it feels
a bit dragged out, I understand that it was to build tension and suspense but to me it was just a bit too long and unnecessary.
The plot twist to me wasn't the revelation that our main character is fooled by the lady lawyer or that laura wasn't actually the mastermind behind it all but rather the fact that the young guy wasn't actually dead when he was about to be drowned. Now that is cold blooded. This moment right here was the true unmasking of a human nature, how low can you go to cover your tracks, even when you think you've hit your lowest point, the thing you tried to hide wasn't actually the worst thing that you could do. How far can you go? Apparently even further down.Well, Expectations exceeded and this movie deserves major props. Most definitely would recommend this movie to other people.At the end of the movie, gave myself a pat on the back and a note for myself to check more foreign movies from spain.",The Invisible Guest

But somewhere in the middle there's and explosion of possible narratives and each tries to trump over the one before. That gets a bit ridiculous, like: ""What if x happened?"", ""Yeah, but was if y happened?"", ""I see your cool story, bro and raise you that z happened!""
At that point the ultimate ""twist"" at the end can be seen in advance and left me wondering about some plotholes. It had a lot of potential to be really cool, but it tried too hard and became a satire of the genre.",The Invisible Guest

This story is very very intricate but also easy enough to follow. I can't really give a summary of the things that happen without giving away one or more of the several twists, but I CAN say this film has just about everything. It's mysterious, thrilling, exciting, a bit sad and right when you think the twists and turns are at a climax they just keep on going. It has elements of a ""who dunnit"" murder mystery along the way as well.If you are a fan of any sort of crime/murder thriller then DO NOT miss this movie. I'm not exaggerating when I say it's the best crime thriller I've seen in years, and I've watched about 100 in the last 8 months. Right now I'm even rambling about it because I just can't say enough about how great it is. Trust me, just watch it. You won't regret it.",The Invisible Guest

I lave the main actor Mario Casas was great in this movie. Also I can mention that the acting of all of the characters was great.The invisible guest, as any detective movie, has to be very precisely analyzed by the director and all the details has to be perfect in order to avoid plot holes. Here there are some, and one of them is when they take a train, we can see that it was an electric trail, but a few seconds later, we can see the characters standing near that train and in the background we can hear the sound of steam whistle. Allover, the film was great.Also, this is one of the few films, where you cannot get distracted even for a second as you will miss a very important detail.Loved this film very much !",The Invisible Guest

Story itself seems a bit far-fetched (including the final reveal and the omniscient defense attorney) while the true and (many) false versions of the story are laid out in quite a tangled manner that leaves the audience perplexed and makes it very difficult to follow.

Is it a clever plot with a shocking twist? No.The final ""twist"", if you can call it that, was ridiculous because it had been so obvious by that time.
I even thought to myself, maybe that wouldn't be the twist because, I mean, hello?! They weren't even trying to hide it properly. It would be absolutely dumb if that were the twist.Turns out it was.I had really hoped that wasn't it, that there was more to this because I rather enjoyed the build-up.
I was cringing at the grand reveal because it seemed they were expecting me to be so shocked and mind blown about it.Uh... no sorry.They could've done this much much better, it's like they were confident people will not notice or figure it out.

1. Point out the exact location on a map where Adrian dumped Daniel's Body. (How could Adrian exactly point out the location on a paper map? Nobody bothers)
2. Records the entire conversation in a Pen, around 3 hrs, and makes him admit that he killed Daniel as well as Laura. ( Can that be admissible as evidence in a court of law? Pl see below)
In the film's climax Virginia Goodman, as Adrian believes, transforms into Elvira Garrido. On seeing that, Adrián gets completely appalled and becomes hopeless. And the very next moment.....The real Virginia Goodman arrives. Tomás Garrido, Daniel's father, calls police. And the film cuts to ending credits.......
So, what happens next?What the director wants:- He wants us to believe that there's no way that Adrián can come out of this case and he's gotta pay for what he did. i.e. he's gonna end up in jail.What could happen:- The moment real Virginia Goodman arrives, Adrián can tell her everything that had happened and do whatever she says. As she had never lost a single case in her entire career, she could easily save Adrián. So, what's the point of the film?
The voice recording can easily be killed in court of law by Virginia Goodman. Coz there are only two voices in the recording: Mrs. Goodman's and Adrian's.
1. Obviously Elvira Garrido couldn't mimic Virginia Goodman.
2. Adrian is a successful businessman who would have given a number of press interviews. So, any professional mimicry artist could mimic his voice.
3. The mark of location on map may not be accurate to locate Daniel's Body.So.. I've One word for this film. ""IMPLAUSIBLE""",The Invisible Guest

I am not familiarized with the actors from the cast, but I can say that their acting is a very good performance and all the filming crew made a good job with this one ! Filming angles, soundtrack, story line, cast, plot, etc, all of them are a lot above the average thriller/mystery clichés that Hollywood got us used to, but still it has some minor issues that, in my opinion, of course, I would have changed. Those 'little problems' made me to decide this movie is a 9, not a 10, a 10 would be a perfect masterpiece, however, this one approaches perfection somehow. 1 hour and 46 minutes are surprisingly enough for this film, even if it may seem too little for a 9-rated movie, for the entire time I didn't get bored or badly surprised, it was just very thrilling and full of action and mystery.

As with his other works it's shot beautifully and he does manage to get consistently excellent performances from his cast. But this one seems a little more heavy handed and forced. It's essentially a twisty whodunit but the thing about twists is that your audience needs to be unaware of the twists for them to work. This film lays on the twists so heavily that no new revelation proves that surprising, especially the final one which is very obvious from the start. Having seen this and The Innocent in the same week I can definitely see the progress the director has made. He pulls back on his tendency to be too clever and his new work is better for it. This could have been such a better film with a slightly lighter touch and less self-indulgence from the director. Still though it's solid enough and worth a watch.",The Invisible Guest

176,gtessarini,How many plot twists can a movie take?,10,21 June 2020,"Although out of the Hollywood style with explosions and fierce pursuits, and even without being inspired by some classic literature, the modern Spanish production, ""The invisible Guest"" (2016), takes your breath away every minute during the time you are watching it, and even after.The plot revolves around the preparation of an iconic and respectable businessman for his trial after being accused of the murder of his paramour. With an innocent, yet unbelievable and full of ""holes"" story, the details that are questioned and explained to successfully fill them in the future trial are the beginning and the middle of a new and complex web of facts and lies related to another unfortunate crime.Focusing on a single and luxurious apartment that serves as a place for various memories and flashbacks, the narrattive of just under two hours in length takes you constantly to an infinite number of paths, hypotheses and opinions. All surprising and questionable, but without loose ends.The movie is a gradual and incessant suspense. The absence of action scenes is filled by the lack of any kind of monotony, either by the great script or by the alternation of expressions of its actors. Filled with doubts and reasoning, the work is no purely intellectual questioning, but rather, a thriller that makes you frantically look at and exchange targets of hatred and sympathy as the plot progresses or makes you think you are moving towards an imaginable or simple ending.After the conclusion of the work, perhaps one or another idea that appeared in the viewer's mind during the course of the plot is similar to some of the various assumptions that the story makes you raise. However, the intensity of the surprise and anxiety it generates will leave you with a tightness in your chest and a round of applause for the production.'The invisible guest"" is a movie that makes you want to advance in time to discover its end soon, but that prevents you from doing so due to the uninterrupted increase in the quantity and quality of discoveries and plot twists.",The Invisible Guest

Story wise: the movie had a good plot, some good twists along the way, but for me during the halfway stages it became a little bit predictable. ( cant go too much into the story ) At the end i was like ""oh okay"",its not comparable to the body, Secret in their eyes etc but still a good one. Acting wise : Everyone was good, but loved the acting of the father of the deceased. If u love a good engaging thriller, and there's time to pass i would say give it a go.",The Invisible Guest

The amount of twists and turns kept me at the edge. Its a longer movie takes a while to build it up but then its a perfect crime, thriller mystery a genre which is so hard to get right. The acting was fantastic especially by the lawyer and protaganist. You won't be sure what is happenin till the very last minute of the movie, thats how it is made!",The Invisible Guest

We definitely need more movies like this. There is a cat and mouse game that unravel plot twists that blow minds. We see how one accident is seen from different perspectives, how the same witness can tell different stories about the same accident. While watching the movie you have no idea who is the guilty one and who is the victim but once the film progresses you understand that there are no victims only guilty people that try to survive. The main character is all of us. Put in a hard situation he acts from passion, takes his decision in a matter of a second. The consequences follow him but he still floats. Or is he? That's the question. I would have given a 10 but I knew what's going on even if they are trying to hide it and boy oh boy, they hide it so well that even I couldn't foreseen the main twist that decides if the main character will get his way or how beautiful people around him manage to counter his decisions.

Well this is one of those films.

The story is perfectly worked out and interesting from start to finish. One of the few films that, after a long time, tells its own great story, which captivates from start to finish.But in my opinion, as good as this story is, the staging is worse and disappointing. The main character did not perform convincingly. It is a pity that such a good plot and idea can be destroyed by such a bad staging. Pure waste.This story should have been filmed by a professional director. A good cast would also have been good for the film. The staging in this case includes: boring camera work, bad and cold exposure, which is not good for the thriller.But one thing has to be left to the film: intelligent and exciting ending. if this film had been staged sensibly, I would have given it an 8-9 out of 10 stars.",The Invisible Guest

And this Spanish mystery thriller is certainly the most ""twisty-turny"" thing I've seen in a while.Set in an atypical Spain made of coniferous forests and mountain resorts, in which a rich businessman and his lover are forced to deal with an unwanted and unforeseen event. Wrong decisions are made leading to guilt and fear while the mystery of what really happened thickens and changes at each turn until it spirals down to its climax. I said spirals, there are so many plot twist in rapid succession that the film ends up spinning. The film is structured in an almost ""Rashomon"" style where different possible solutions to the mystery are shown in flashback. Ideally the viewer should be trying to work out its own solution as well before the final plot twists are unleashed on us. Once a thriller becomes predictable it looses its appeal and The Invisible Guest (Contratiempo) by Oriol Paulo seems on a mission to baffle us till the very end.",The Invisible Guest

216,loganp-29630,Convoluted but not complex.,3,7 May 2020,"Just because you shove a bunch of twists down someone's throat doesn't make it a good film. It is also worth noting that the twists just didn't work on a story telling level. This film reminds me of the Futurama episode where it spoofs twilight zone and there is just twist after twist and Bender finally says at the end ""I saw it coming."" At least Futurama's Twilight Zone had interesting, unique twists. In this movie, however, the twists were painfully obvious, and more importantly, painfully mediocre. The only one I was slightly surprised about was that the kid was still alive when the main character pushed him in the water. Then I quickly realized ""oh yes the idiots didn't check whether he was alive or anything because who would?"" The only twist that worked for me only worked because I was operating under the assumption that they weren't completely incompetent, and unintelligent. If I wanted to watch a show about idiot criminals I would watch Trailer Park Boys (also, no thank you). It is kind of upsetting when I realize how poor this writing was now that I think about it more. Then the final reveal worked cinematically. It honestly was a beautiful scene. The music was great and the lighting was great and it was properly dramatic how she peeled off her face, but it didn't make it a good twist. It was painfully obvious this woman wasn't who she said she was. It isn't a twist when it is a simple misdirection ""oh this lady of obvious nefarious intent is actually the wife, okay."" It had decent enough acting. I'm a big fan of carefully crafted, natural, and engaging dialogue, but I will not go there because it is a second language and I doubt the translation more than I doubt the writer; I can possibly extrapolate, however, because if this series of twists is what the writer(s) passes off as good writing then I can only imagine that the sometimes poor, cheesy, unnatural dialogue is what they imagined as proper writing. Three stars because the music was good and cinematography was decent (nothing groundbreaking to reason any higher). One more thing, well it's a question really, was the fact that the male lead was actually the lead perpetrator supposed to be a twist or something just assumed, and then they confirmed as a nice nod to the audience? As they nod to us and say ""see our writing truly is as shallow as you think it is.""",The Invisible Guest

229,patroklosmech,Good part of an ongoing process,8,24 July 2017,"A quite intriguing, fascinating film that kept me at high alert at many points and I felt true agony and anxiety. Using a downplayed and somewhat gloomy photography, as light is not prevalent in the film, combined with the dark atmosphere of the events, the uncertainty and many illusions of the film are excellently projected. Its great use of winter and forest surroundings adds special colour to the film, something like a countryside taste which could fit any European country. Corruption and social variations form part of the support means of the plot, creating a contrast between the middle-aged couple with a comfortable but quiet and conventional living style and the glamorous world of modern business and art, mixed with conspiracies and secrets, supported by unscrupulous lawyers and magistrates. The film uses elements of Agatha Christie novels, such as the many twists of the plot, and also themes from Hitchcock epics, for instance long, prolonged, scenes filled with uncertainty and fear. It deserves viewing and I hope to see even better from the director, as I suspect he can make an even subtler, scarier and nail-biting crime mystery- thriller. I am sure he still stands on the middle steps of the ladder, having though already accomplished honourable results.",The Invisible Guest

243,nottaproblemuk,A Must-See For Thriller Fans,9,5 July 2020,"Going into this movie, I wasn't sure what to expect. The audience ratings were solid, yet the critic reviews were a little underwhelming in comparison, which only goes to show - always trust the PEOPLE over the critics! Thriller movies that fall under the mystery/suspense category are often hit-and-miss. Many of them miss the mark, particularly these days. This is why it's all the more satisfying when you stumble upon one that truly hits the spot, and manages to find that magic formula. 'The Invisible Guest' is a perfect example of that.The best thing about this film is it's ability to combine plausibility with unpredictability. Often, when Thriller/Mystery movies fall short, it's usually either a result of their inability to keep the audience guessing, or their excessive use of 'dramatic license' which frequently results in glaringly obvious plot holes and all too predictable 'plot twists' that feel forced and lazy. The truly captivating thing about this film is that much of the mystery comes as much from the minds of the characters as it does from the overall plot. It doesn't need to resort to far-fetched storylines or ridiculous twists to be shocking - because the nature of the conversation that takes place between two of the main characters - Adrian Dora and the excellent Virginia Goodman - naturally takes you on a journey (or several journeys) that ultimately leads you down blind alleys and into intensely dramatic territory, without ever having to compromise the believability of the plot.If you're a fan of those classic unpredictable and tension-filled Mystery Thrillers that keep you sat and guessing on the edge of your seat throughout - such as Seven, Gone Girl, Zodiac etc - then 'The Invisible Guest' is a must-see for you. The more the storyline develops and the mystery builds, the more compelling and captivating it becomes. Plus, just as with any great Mystery Thriller, the ending or 'final act' will leave you just as shocked and gobsmacked as you were after witnessing the climactic final moments of 'Seven'... (""what's in the box?!"")All in all, I give this film a solid 9/10. The only reason it isn't higher is because the 10/10 scores should be reserved for those movies that very much fall into the 'among the best of all time' category. Whilst 'The Invisible Guest' doesn't quite make it into that category, it remains, in my opinion, one of the most captivating, mind-blowing, well crafted and truly shocking Thrillers to reach our screens since David Fincher's 'Gone Girl'.Do yourself a favour - cancel any plans you may have this evening, stay home, and watch the truly exceptional 'The Invisible Guest'...You can thank me later.",The Invisible Guest

The movie almost turned sci fied because of this.If Doria did not know how Tomas wife looks like until the end when she reveals her truth identity works much better for the movie.",The Invisible Guest

I'm a big Noir fan and this gave me sooo much of that!!!SPOILERSSS FROM HERE ON::***********
I found the scene very scary when the protagonist's story about him being in the hotel room shows a guy in the cupboard watching the protagonist stand in the room - I found that very scary!! Although later we find out that was all a lie and he was alone in the room.
I also found it very scary towards the end just as when the lawyer is leaving the protagonist's room I felt really scared for her I thought at any moment this guy could turn so the whole idea of anything could happen scared me!
I also found it really creepy+scary when the woman started removing her contacts and wig in the end lool.. I can watch loooads of horror movies but what really scares is psychological thriller :(=",The Invisible Guest

Several wonderings may arise in order to explain these obvious loose ends. Why should Mr. Doria hire a witness expert lawyer to ""save"" his life and clean up his name without deeply investigating in advance who she is, where does she come from and so on? Have Felix and his client (Mr. Doria) been in touch with Virginia before the meeting? Are they aware about exact meeting date? Does Tomas Garrido's wife have the ability and astuteness to supplant a brilliant lawyer without looked suspicious for not even a second? You can see real Virginia showing up at his door two or three hours later than the fake one(so late), which is hardly difficult to understand and explain.In general, entertaining inspite of the poor acting and loose ends.

Essentially you outsmart the movie and eventually lose the option of being shocked. All in all, a not so competent thriller, but a bit better than average only due to a consistent enough depiction of a narcissist.I wouldn't recommended it, however, depending on your tastes and attention span, you might enjoy the time spent solving the mystery yourself before the characters reveal it for you.",The Invisible Guest

There is a little overacting by one character, imo, but overall a very talented cast. It is also shot very nicely. If you are new to the genre, you might not see the ""twist"", but if you watch a lot of mysteries or thrillers odds are it will become glaringly obvious very early. If you work it out early on, you might begin to feel the way I did (or maybe not) but it started to become a bit tedious. It is not a waste of time or terrible, but neither is it mind blowing or anything you haven't seen before if you watch this type of movie or program a lot. I would recommend it for a rainy day or if your in the mood for an atmospheric thriller, but just know the secret isn't that tough to work out so it might end up being more of a drama than a mystery.",The Invisible Guest

For better or for worse, there's much more and better out there. This is not a good thriller, it isn't even a good Spanish thriller (for more on that go watch ""La isla mínima"", ""El hombre de las mil caras"" or ""El reino"").You can see its main weaknesses in the first few minutes: boring protagonists without an inch of life and a non-existent tension. From this point, it was difficult to climb up, however, the plot gets here throwing a little bit of light.The film takes too long to actually happen until it starts to twist the story, due to its failing at creating any kind of ""time is running out"" feeling or danger. It feels as if the interview has all the time in the world and her stopwatch is just a lousy magician's trick. I would highlight nontheless the different paths the plot goes throughout the end of the film, that's the most interesting and thrilling part.

324,peekpook,So so,3,12 April 2020,"In my opinion it is overrated and I would still prefer The Usual Suspects any time.
The set up was interesting and the looks of the movie is nice. But the film development is sluggish and at some point too repetitive.
Now to the spoiler part (dont read further if you havent watched it yet)
I saw that ms Goodman was the mother from the moment they presented her character during the flashback part. It wasnt that hard to notice that they were the same person and honestly, i thought we were supposed to know it and that it was part of the construction of the whole plot. But the film ended and... it wasnt. So that was kind of a cold shower, leaving me disappointed with the whole thing.
Also her reaction to the news that her son was alive before drowning was also another sign that we were supposed to know her identity.
So no, it is NOT an amazing film as other reviws are pointing out, but thats for me. It is a nice attempt by a non hollywood company, but it left me very disappointed in the end.",The Invisible Guest

Upon a second viewing I realised how Farfetch his story is but the way it is told almost makes it believable.The only blemish on a otherwise stellar film was that the cgi during the crash was a bit bad and the rest of the cgi is a bit mediocre but it doenst destract too much from the film.That ending twist was amazing and I love the way they build up to it, it isn't just some Deus ex Machina buy the bread crumbs were placed very deliberately and carefully.I would recommend this film to everyone.",The Invisible Guest

Well, not really, depends if he is really hot and young or not. It seems that a businessman crossed Oriol when he was in the US, and since then he writes elaborate revenge movies that copy from De Palma, Hitchcock and even Shyamalan without reaching any heights related to these directors.

337,g-53211,A little thought of the beginning,10,24 September 2017,"It is absolutely fair to say the suspense is great all throughout the show. However, I had some concern about the beginning of the cover-up.According to the final version of ""fact"", the boss directed everything, and apparently he has a strong stroke of egoism. But, the decision he made not to call the police was quite weird for me at first sight, which may indicates a classic impression of rich alpha males.So, as compared to all the follow-up uncovered, what would happen if police knows of the event at the outset? Since the venerable mom didn't refer to the accident itself, we could take it as a true condition, based on which it is reasonable for the boss to insist his innocence and blame the deer. Another detail backing this approach is the unnoticeable dent on the front of the car, which leads to the fact that there is no direct clash between two cars, though the boss' reaction toward this emergency definitely results in what then happens to the poor boy.But, from the perspective of the boss, this cover-up may seems quite reasonable. Given that he unswervingly believe the positive consequence of a cover- up, which means no disturbance from the police and, more important, no harm to the promising career of an upstart entrepreneur, every otherwise plan just doesn't offer enough benefit to pay off the cost. Therefore, it is indeed, according to the mom, sheer foolishness about his control of the world that leads him to this fiasco. Sad! P.S.: I wonder what would happen if the true lawyer devise another plan to repudiate all unveiled evidence? No quite probable?",The Invisible Guest

I'd like to address the negative comments by saying you are not entirely wrong.
Too many smart people out there. I mean it. Technology has ruined mystery story telling. Poking holes in story lines because of GPS, time stamps, what cell phones can do and not do. Too much knowledge. I think it would be better to set stories like this several decades back so you don't have so many smarty pants. Really now to point out a goof because a train station shows a train logo with steam and the train is electric.
It's the story that counts. The people. Who they are and what they did. And why.
This was very skillfully done. Also, some of the criticisms come from people who either don't know or didn't realize that unreliable narration is a theme.

Since I started watching it I said why not, I wasn't expecting Agatha Christie material after all. I have no idea why does it have so much positive reviews because it was super predictable, it was forced in twists and it has ended with actually no logic - recording the evidence and whole story WITHOUT police surveillance. It only pointed out to the thing we didn't see at the end - culprit was released because of lack of evidence, since such collected evidence is considered illegal in whole civil law and guilt can not be based on it. Maybe that was post-ending twist?Also pointing out on a map in newspapers where the car was pushed in lake but main villain can not guess from the pictures was it or wasn't it there? I can't recall when was main character made a cartographer expert - but after one drive, during the night he hit the spot like a champ, real pirate x. Super dumb actually.Thank you but next time ask actual lawyer or judge or prosecutor before actually hitting on a justice card. I'm giving it 2*s because there are worse movies.

395,misswords,"Review of The Invisible Guest (Contratiempo), directed by Oriol Paulo.",10,22 July 2017,"The Invisible Guest (Contratiempo) written and directed by Oriol Paulo, is a Spanish thriller starring Ana Wagener as lawyer Virginia Goodman, and Mario Casas, as businessman Adrian Doria. The film is strategically delivered in the inverted pyramid style - the crux of the story is made out to be the most crucial and most telling, but all it is is the straw that broke the camel's back. Businessman Adrian and his lover Laura are found by police in a remote hotel room in Spain. Adrian has been knocked unconscious by an unknown intruder and Laura has been bludgeoned to death with a very heavy concrete sculpture. None of the other hotel guests see anyone leave or go into that room, so the police pin the crime on Adrian. He claims he is innocent. This is not the pinnacle of the plot though. Everything that allowed Adrian and Laura to come to the hotel room is. Enter Lawyer Virginia Goodman (Wagener) who is highly regarded in her field. She hasn't lost a single defence case yet. Inside Adrian's apartment riveting dialogue between these two characters unravels, and it is questions after questions after question. Answer after answer after answer. It is interrogative, engaging and fast moving. With this dialogue, viewers are given the backstory. We know Virginia is good - she is the lawyer who will get Adrian off the hook. While she tests him for holes in his story she too is being tested - can he trust her and is she smart enough to pull off his defence in a court of law? It is here when the perspective of the movie is shifted, and the perspective on the facts of the case change, at the desires of Virginia herself. She verbally puts Adrian into the jury's shoes. She shows him what they will see and she presents his case back to himself in a way that has the potential to suggest he is guilty of murdering his lover. He is enraged - his guilt has been discovered by his lawyer and he doesn't like it. It is at this point Oriol Paulo has masterfully played with angles and perspective, and has allowed us to realise we have been deceived. We have been deceived this whole time. How stupid we were. We thought Adrian was innocent! When dialogue is that quick, crafted, and precise, many outcomes are plausible. Many facts of a crime can be skewed and delivered on a different silver platter and still be plausible. At this point we are completely entranced, and want to know more. We thought he was innocent. Could he really be guilty? Guilt never crossed our minds. How blind we were. Screenplays and the facts of a crime have one thing in common: anything can be twisted and changed and still make sense in the end. Oriol Paulo knows there's more than one way to skin a cat. Ten out of ten. Amazing, thought-provoking and definitely worth watching, again and again.",The Invisible Guest

Moreover, the guest was shot by Oriol Paolo, a man who put his hand to such important tapes as ""Enlightenment"" (as a screenwriter) and ""Body"" (as a director and screenwriter).Quite often in Spanish cinema, the action does not immediately gain momentum, but only after a while. This film did not become an exception. Initially, ""Guest"" may seem boring and slightly tightened, but soon enough the story begins to add to the dynamics and does not let the viewer go until the final credits. It is worth noting how well the director builds the narrative, differently presented the same event",The Invisible Guest

420,hgbarnet,"Great Movie, whether you're Spanish or not.",9,21 April 2020,"The Invisible Guest (or Contratiempo) is a spanish thriller directed by the famous director and screen writer Oriol Paulo. In this movie (released in January of 2017), we find Adrían Doria, a sucessful businessmen who is arrested for the suspected murder of his lover, Laura Vidal. Adrían hires one of the best defense attorney's, Virginia Goodman to help prove his innocence.
Throughout the movie, we find out that he is involved, along with Laura, in a cover up murder of a man named Daniel Goodman. Adrían hides details from the events that transpired from Virginia in order to try to save himself. During the movie, we are informed of the real truth regarding all of this, but are still left hanging of the edge of our seat till the very end. Just when you think you have figured it out, Oriol will throw another twist at you that you did not expect.
The music during this movie conveys a message of suspense as well as mystery which makes you want to keep watching. The cinematography is dark shots which adds to the suspense even further. I believe that the central message is that you cannot hide from your past and in the end justice will be done. Adrían is trying to cover up his past throughout the movie, but Virginia is able to piece the story together and we learn the truth.
I believe that there are few mistakes in this movie, and overall it is one that you must watch over and over agin (Similar to inception) in order to fully understand it. I would encourage anyone who loves thrillers to give this movie a watch, it is well worth your time",The Invisible Guest

469,razmuz-r,A Spanish David Fincher?,7,23 January 2019,"Though the story can be difficult to follow some of the time, flashback within a flashback, the director - and screenwriter - of this movie shows great talent for telling a suspenselful tale with twists, turns and revelations that you might not have expected and that will leave you wanting more-The color palette reminds you of David Fincher. The tempo, story and rhythm reminds you of Christopher Nolan and the setup of the film reminds you of an old noir.Watching this movie I was quite excited and on the edge of my seat for certain parts of the film. The director shows great control in working with suspense and at hinting details for the characters, and for the audience, to pick up on. It's a great ride trying to figure out who did what along with Adrián Doria and Virginia Goodman. The story is well constructed and the characters are very well written. All of them are three dimensional and as we get to know them better for each minute we understand their reasoning and motivation.The color palette reminds you of Davin Fincher, but I do sometimes wish that the director, Mr. Oriol Paulo, would have turned down his visual style in turn for focusing on the plot since it often took me out of the story a bit.The feature is well crafted, but it could be occasionally be challenging to know exactly where a certain scene would take you - but I guess that's the point as well, to make the audience feel confused. This does just not always work very well as I could feel myself trying to figure out what is up and down instead of following the story.I did not know much about this film before watching it and therefore it also took me sometime to figure out what the plot was and who the important characters were. There were many and it was troublesome to keep track on them for the first half hour of the film, also because it jumped back and forth in time and what not.It is an entertaining movie with a super interesting premise and it is a film that will make you think as much as it bewilders and shocks you. I was surprised at how much I enjoyed it.It is clear that the director is inspired by the classics as well as American film directors, but I am looking forward to seeing him develop his own style and discovering his coming films in the future.If you are in the mood for a time-jumping, unpredictable movie with twists and turns, I can recommend this one.//A humble fan of films",The Invisible Guest

Do the same for ~5 Minutes and you will see the pattern how most of the 9/10 and 10/10 are constructed. It repeats itself very quick. I believe this rating is manufactured. Maybe they are paying for upvotes and good reviews or somebody involved with this movie profits from a better rating.This movie was a mediocre 5/10. That was my first, intuitive reaction.

It's an ambitious story, it's full of plot twists, and it will have you sitting on the edge of your seat trying to figure out the truth. **Made in Spain, the film has English subtitles, but it is SO worth watching this exquisite movie.",The Invisible Guest

487,sy-27609,"nice movie, but still not perfect",8,16 April 2017,"According to what Adrián said to the police (not necessarily the true story), he was attacked by someone and hit the mirror, then this ""someone"" murdered Laura. And people in the hallway heard the sound that the ""someone"" hit Laura with the weapon. But at the end, what really happened is that Adrián hit Laura first, people in the hallway heard the noise and gathered around, then he hit the mirror to make it looked like someone framed him. But if that's the case, people should hear the noise of him hitting the mirror AFTER the noise of him hitting Laura. Then the police should know he was lying. But seems no one suspected about it.",The Invisible Guest

491,miloslalic,Wow!,10,27 May 2017,"My, oh, my! First 'El cuerpo/The body' and now this. Spanish cinematography does not fail to impress. This has been their most successful thriller by far, and I believe there will be more. Having Mario Casas in a movie by itself is a reason enough to see this movie, and did he deliver! The acting is astonishing, this world deserves more Spanish actors, but the directing was a pure masterpiece. Orioul Paulo is a man to be reckoned with. Throughout the movie, the plot will take you on numerous emotional and moral roller coasters, and every time you think you know it right, the plot will mercilessly prove you wrong. I enjoyed the movie from the first seconds till the last ones. If you are willing to dive into the depths of Spanish thrillers, this is the best movie to begin your journey with.",The Invisible Guest
492,originalsam,I am touched!,10,24 June 2017,"This movie is simply .. . extraordinary. I am so happy because I have watch this movie. It's an art!And, I have to say, Mario Casas is excellent actor. I'd like to meet him. I hope, this year I'll visit Spain. Many Spanish movies and series are magnificent. For example: Internado, El Barco, Fisica o quimica, Rec, and the others.Love Spain ♥",The Invisible Guest

This was a perfectly directed thriller,great acting ,brilliant music,pacing,acting and plot .what a plot !
As this was subtitled ( as it's Spanish) but had great reviews I thought I would give it a go..but was absolutely glued from start to finish...what a fantastic film that must be seen to be believed...it's twists and turns will have you tied in a knot...I actually watched it again the following morning ,and you will too..please turn the phone off,dim the lights, sit back and prepare to be amazed....",The Invisible Guest
495,maithamaldawood,Terrific,8,12 July 2017,"This movie is a masterpiece movie. This is the only Spanish movie I have watched, but it worth watching such this one. For people who like mystery and crime movies, so this is the one you should watch. I do not want to ruin the story to tell what the series in this movie is, rather I really recommend you to enjoy the story yourself.",The Invisible Guest
496,donkeybraids,*loud voice* anyone who says this is a good thriller is a liar,1,17 July 2017,"in my opinion this film doesn't even deserve a 1. it deserves a -1. it deserves less than a -1. this is not a good film, this is not a good thriller. in fact, this is not a thriller at all. anyone who talks about the plot twist (i won't spoil it) must be blind, i knew this supposed plot twist as soon as a certain scene came on. there is nothing surprising or thrilling about this film, it's bland and unrealistic. i would not even suggest this film to my worst enemy. DO NOT WATCH THIS FILM.",The Invisible Guest
497,milenam-86995,What a waist of time,1,29 July 2017,"I guess that all actors from this movie gave this good rating, that is the only reason why the rating is 8. First thing first the acting is horrible. The scenario is below average. There are no twist here, every twist in this movie is exactly what is expect that will happen.Do your self a favor and don't even try to watch it...",The Invisible Guest

500,seanadlan,One of the best Movie,10,6 October 2017,"I really love this movie so much that i have to write a comment for the first time.This is actually one of the best movie i have ever seen in recent years,Its just so full of suspense and leave you doubting what the next event could be.Its all about a young Man who killed his own lover all because of being self centred and selfishness.He tried his best to cover up his crime but people who are smarter than him could track him down intelligently.A movie full on intrigue and also very educational.",The Invisible Guest

502,georgiazis,Subversive movie,10,27 December 2017,Searching for a movie to watch I saa w the reviews score for this film and I said this must be good. I don't remember watching a Spanish movie before so at first I was somehow disappointed. In the end of the movie I wanted to write a review!,The Invisible Guest
503,kpt-53487,A hidden gem,9,21 January 2021,"I'm so glad I found this movie. I stumbled upon it by accident on Netflix and thought I'd give it a try, seeing how La Casa del Papel (""Money Heist"") was a big hit and of very high quality. And boy this movie did not disappoint! It's one of these movies where you don't know what really happened and this theme continues through the entire film until the very end. I had so many theories as to who was the culprit and all of them were wrong... kind of.
The only thing I have to criticize is that it was a bit too slow around the middle part and that there were one or two logical errors. Apart from that, brilliantly written, brilliant acting and a big twist at the end, simply great!",The Invisible Guest
504,acistylnei,Really enjoyable.. Made account just to give it 10 stars,10,17 February 2018,"For some time now I was not able to find a good, interesting movie that will make me actually enjoy what I am watching. This movie did just that! A perfect movie for a perfect movie night. Story is interesting, actors very good, music good.. Maybe I would have thought that it is a bit too long if I was not in a mood for a movie.. But since I was I did not mind.",The Invisible Guest
505,whynjust,Good story telling with logical flaw,8,20 August 2021,"This movie tells the story in a clear manner. But there are a few scenes look rather trying to complete the story than making sense.1. The car speed wasn't that fast, it doesn't look like a fatal car accident to me. And normal people's reaction would be checking if that person is actually dead than just pulling him into trunk.2. It is really hard for a person to push a car into water with just one push.3. The place where he dumped the car looks like a big opening for people to go boating. And considering the car would sink at that spot, it wouldn't be that hard for police or people nearby to find a sunken car.4. The lawyer looks like a smart guy, it's not that a smart move to send someone your client has never seen before at the last minute.5. This is simply a car accident and love affair, worst case scenario you lose your marriage and pay some money. Normal people with successful career wouldn't want to risk going to jail to cover it up.6. The ink from the pen leaking looks really weird to me.7. I'm not sure what is the law in Spain. But in some states in the US, the recording without consent can't be used as evidence in court.",The Invisible Guest

511,prabhuaussie,This is it!,9,21 August 2018,"If you are someone who ran out of good movies to watch and been disappointed of watching movies that looked good only on posters and felt un-satisfied by even some of the successful movies out there. This is it! this one would break your fast!As a growing movie lover I look for certain details in a movie like clarity in dialogue, unique narration style, less or no animations, pleasing locations, just necessary background score and brilliant climax. This one checks all the boxes for me.Sometime when a movie ends it leaves you with a silence, a feel good silence, a silence that feels like a satisfaction and the silence breaks after a while when someone interrupts you but I let that silence continue for a long-time for this one. That's me feeling my inner-piece after this movie.",The Invisible Guest
